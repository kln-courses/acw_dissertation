<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Chapter 10: Diachronic variation in the art of the Sydney Basin  10  DIACHRONIC vARIATION IN THE ART OF THE SYDNEY  BASIN This chapter investigates the role of time as a significant factor accounting for variability in the  Sydney rock art. It is assumed that the majority of the region’s art coincides with the recent  archaeological evidence in the region - the late Holocene Bondaian periods. The Bondaian has  three phases of production based on changes in stone tool technology. At issue here is whether  these phases correlate with the different kinds of social changes and relations which might also  be reflected by the region’s art.  There are few indications of clear-cut diachronic change in the Sydney Basin art style  (contra Arnhem Land, the Kimberley or Western Desert art sequences; Chaloupka 1985, 1994;  Lewis 1988; McDonald 2005a; McDonald and Veth 2007; Taçon and Chippindale 1993; Walsh  1994). Social change in Sydney may not have been as dramatic as was evidenced in Arnhem Land  or the Western Desert over the last 10,000 years.   The relationship between lithic technology, typology and social change is a highly complex  one. The ‘intensification debate’ (Lourandos 1985, Lourandos and Ross 1994) characterises late  Holocene increases in the number of sites and changes in their uses. A number of researchers have  explored the archaeological evidence for Holocene demographic and technological changes in a  range of different environments (e.g. Attenbrow 2004, Barker 2004, Beaton 1985, Boot 1996,  David et al. 2006, Lampert and Hughes 1974, Lourandos 1985, Ross 1985, M.A. Smith 1982,  Thorley 1999; Ulm 2006; Veth 2006; Williams 1985). Such studies have produced a variety of  behavioural explanations (see Attenbrow 2004:185-186; cf. Bird and Frankel 1991).   If the social ramifications of changes in lithic technology are poorly understood, then the  relationships between lithic technologies and artistic traditions have been even less transparent  for the Sydney region.   In other parts of Australia, the burgeoning of regional art bodies has been explained in  terms of greater demographic pressure,  increased social complexity and amplified territoriality  (David 1991; David and Cole 1990; McDonald and Veth 2006; Morwood 1984, 2002; Rosenfeld  1993, 2002). It has been argued that patterns of change in symbolic behaviour (including rock  art) were functionally interrelated with changes in resource structure, technology and economy  (David 2002, Morwood 1987). A similar model has now been developed for the Sydney region.  This model views art as the material manifestation of peoples’ value systems and ideologies and  as having a role in negotiating social relations. Through the art, inherent conflicts and stressful  situations are mediated.  The expectation of this model is that increased social pressure would result in increased art  production. Social pressure and increased interaction is likely to be a consequence of increased  population pressure. Cultural phases with the greatest amounts of archaeological evidence  (Attenbrow 2004, Lourandos 1985, Ross 1985) are likely to be correlated with phases of peak art  production providing in situ evidence for symbolic behaviour (Conkey 1978, 1980; Gamble 1982;  Morwood 1987). During such cultural phases there would be increased levels of territoriality,  with amplified inter-group competition and imposed ‘political’ control necessitating group action  and re-action. During such a period the conditions would be ideal for demonstrations of local and  regional group identity (viz. Wiessner 1989). terra australis 27 229 </page> <page sequence="2"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange  While group identity and territoriality are imposed at a local level, increased social  complexity also necessitates broad scaled social cohesion. The emergence of regionally distinctive systems for encoding ... may therefore document  the emergence of more standardised ceremonial, trade, and mating networks, which were  bounded by emphasising stylistic differences...(Morwood 1984:370) Regionally distinctive styles are seen to not only distinguish one culture area from another; they  can also demonstrate social cohesion at the regional level. Shared ceremonial commitments and  widespread stylistic similarities in items of material culture and body design are other signs of  regional cultural cohesion.  In the preceding chapter the contemporaneity of art production with other forms of  occupation evidence in sheltered locations was demonstrated. The art produced in shelters is  considered to have had highly visible social context and should reveal localised stylistic patterning.  In this chapter I explore how changes in the lithic production and occupational evidence may be  correlated with changes in pigment art production over time.  Sheltered art is the better medium for exploring diachronic variability at several levels.  Open engraving sites generally lack any superimpositionning. Sheltered sites often contain  superimposed sequences. As indicated above, they are also often associated with dateable deposits.  Pigment art also has the potential to be directly dated, using AMS techniques. This technique  was in its infancy when this research was undertaken, and so only limited testing was attempted  (McDonald 2000c, McDonald et al. 1990). Since then, techniques have improved (McDonald  and Veth 2005, 2008; Rowe 2001) and the Sydney region offers great potential for further direct  dating analysis (e.g. Taçon et al. 2006). A previous regional approach to diachronic variability Previous regional art studies have analysed the possibility of diachronic stylistic variability, but  few in the detail of Morwood’s (1979) Central Queensland Highlands work. Working on a sample  of 92 art sites with 17,025 motifs, he analysed stylistic variability over time, and correlated this  with excavated data for the region. [S]ome of the changes in the art through time, are clear. Others are less so, while others are still  tenuous. However, taken in combination, they suggest that there was a general pattern of change  which included colours, techniques, compositions, and context. Relative dating techniques ...  used to outline these differences, are differential weathering, superimpositions, spatial analysis,  subject and style. (Morwood 1979:278) Morwood detailed the technical difficulties associated with the recognition of superimpositions  and discussed the problems of demonstrating comparative bias (i.e. non-random variations) in the  distribution of artistic variables in any sequence. He concluded that superimposition sequences  can only deal with major changes in the most common variables. Morwood argued that much of  the inter- and intra-site variability in his region reflected the episodic nature of art production.  He  identified  that small assemblages commonly reflect a single artistic event and successfully  demonstrated that spatial analysis of these could refine a regional sequence.   A threefold sequence was defined for the Central Queensland Highlands based on technique  and colour and a change in motif emphasis. Seriation of the three art phases with the archaeological  context was done using relative chronologies from excavated site data, the introduction of stone  axes (in deposit and art) and stencilled contact motifs (particularly trade axes). Elements of  Morwood’s approach are of relevance here. The following assumptions and methodology direct  the current analysis: terra australis 27 230 </page> <page sequence="3"> Chapter 10: Diachronic variation in the art of the Sydney Basin 1)  It is assumed that association (and direction of association) between contemporary art  categories is random. Therefore:  a) the number of superimpositions that an art type is involved in is proportional to the  frequency of that art type  and,  b) there being no inherent bias in the direction of association between pairs of categories; 2)  small art assemblages provide better information about contemporaneity of stylistic variables  than large complex sites. Small assemblages are likely to represent a single artistic event; 3)  large complex sites are most likely to produce superimpositionning information; 4)  colour, context, composition and technique are all aspects which are sensitive to change  over time. These need to be analysed individually and in combination, by the processes  of superimpositionning, and through quantitative analyses to investigate trends in spatial  patterning and motif preference. An earlier model for diachronic change in the Sydney Basin shelter art McCarthy  (1967[1979],  1988)  identified  a  temporal  sequence  for  pigment  art  in  the  Sydney  Basin. This was based on the introduction (and decline) of certain colour preferences and artistic  techniques, e.g. stencilling, bichrome, polychrome. The sequence was not correlated with the  engraved component, nor was it synchronised with the ERS. McCarthy’s art sequence was based  on several sites from across the region (McCarthy 1988:18) and was as follows:   (1)  Stencil phase. Stencils in red and white, also yellow, of human hands and feet, and  artefacts, in wet paint, together with the imprints of human hands and feet, and an  occasional outline figure. This is the earliest phase. (2)   Red and white phase. Drawings in dry pigment in outline, solid and various infilled  styles, of culture heroes, humans, animals and artefacts. (3)  Black phase. Drawings in dry charcoal in a wider range of subjects than Phase 2, in  outline, solid and various infilled styles, with an important series of black and red,  black and white, black and yellow bichromes, red, white and black trichromes; the  richest phase of shelter art in the region. (4)   Polychrome phase. This is known in only one figure, a culture hero in four colours,  associated with a large red bora initiation ground figure. (5)  White stencil phase. A very rich phase of stencils of human hands and feet, animals’  paws, a wide variety of artefacts parts of plants and other subjects.       McCarthy’s (1988:18) sequence does not withstand large scale field testing (McDonald 1988b).  The major methodological, theoretical and practical problems with the sequence include:   stencils at the beginning and end of the sequence provide an untestable hypothesis;  how do you differentiate between an early white stencil and a late one?;   the sequence omits several techniques which are quite common across the region -  white, red and yellow paintings and the three distinct engraving techniques; terra australis 27 231 </page> <page sequence="4"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange   the sequence is not correlated with any recognisable archaeological phases. While  not invalidating the sequence, this limits its usefulness. Several of the phases were  thought to be ‘probably contemporaneous’ (McCarthy 1988: 18): hence these are not  technically temporal phases. In the north of the region, Sim’s work in a large rockshelter west of the Macdonald River provided  a detailed superimpositionning analysis (1969: 168-70). He proposed the following sequence at  this site:   1.   red infill;    2.   white stencils, black infill, red infill/white outline, white outline;   3.   black infill/white outline, white infill, red outline;  4.  black outline. At Maroota (south of the Hawkesbury River and north of ‘Canoelands’) a complex medium sized  assemblage provided a different superimposition sequence (McDonald 1986a (Vol. 2): 60-70).  The art in this shelter included white stencils (hands, material objects and twigs) and drawings,  black and red drawings and cream drawings and paintings. One black and white bichrome motif  was present. The superimposition relationships here indicated that the art was executed in a single  phase. A charcoal outline and infill ship motif amongst the assemblage, led to the assumption that  this assemblage was relatively recent. The Maroota assemblage challenges McCarthy’s sequence,  both because a contact motif (in charcoal) appears over white stencils (Phase 1 or 5?), and because  of the contemporaneity of techniques which McCarthy suggests may be separated into different  phases.   At the Audley site in the south of the region, a sequence was discerned which fitted into the  early and intermediate phases of McCarthy’s model (Cox et al. 1968). However, Officer’s work  in the Campbelltown region indicated that there is no support for a chronological sequence of  colours or support for a stylistic division according to colour (Officer 1984: 32).  McCarthy’s sequence has been found to have major limitation in its application to sites  across the Sydney region. In part this is because it does not accommodate the full range of artistic  traits known to exist; but also because it subdivides the art into unworkable and untestable  divisions. Individual sites, including no doubt his original type sites, support parts of the sequence  but at a broader scale there is limited applicability. diachronic variability in the art of mangrove creek The aim of this analysis was to synthesise trends in rock shelter occupation indices and artistic  traits. This analysis was based on superimposition analysis in large assemblages, analysis of motif  preferences and a quantitative analysis of artistic variables in small sites. The Sample and the Technique variables This test of diachronic variability involves shelter art sites from the Mangrove Creek drainage  basin. The 65 shelter art sites used included 26 sites recorded in UMCC (Attenbrow 1981, 1987;  Gunn 1979) and 39 sites from Warre Warren in the mid-reaches of the valley (McDonald 1987,  1988a). These sites provide both sufficient detail of recording in a local context where there is an  excavated and dated local archaeological sequence. Seven of the 65 shelter art sites included in  terra australis 27 232 </page> <page sequence="5"> Chapter 10: Diachronic variation in the art of the Sydney Basin this analysis have also been excavated (Attenbrow 1981, 1987, 2004; MacIntosh 1965: Upside- Down-Man, this volume).  A localised assemblage was selected for this analysis given synchronic variation across the  region. The resultant sequence may not, therefore, be broadly applicable on a regional basis, but  require modification to accommodate localised variability.  A comprehensive list of 58 variables (colour, form and technique combinations) was  initially used in this analysis (Table 10.1). Two levels of analysis were undertaken: 1. sites were counted for the presence and frequency of these 58 variables, i.e. the  each assemblage was treated as a single entity and the presence of variables was  counted;   and, 2. the motif classification  (used elsewhere  in  this  research) was counted using  these  58 variables to investigate motif/technique preferences and possible trends in  preferences over time. The frequency and distribution of these technique variables at the sites was initially investigated with  the aim of determining which of these had the potential to provide the necessary information.   Assemblage sizes in the Upper Mangrove Creek sample are generally smaller than those  found in the Warre Warren area. The 26 UMCC sites contained 424 motifs, while the 39 Warre  Warren sites produced 2,371 motifs: 5.6 x the number of motifs from 1.5 x as many sites (Table  10.2). A twin column chi squared test on the motif assemblages from these two samples revealed  that the differences between these were not statistically significant (at .05 level).  Generally speaking, the extended technical variables (cf. Table 10.3 and Table 10.4) occur  in very low percentage frequencies, i.e. 17 variables account for 91.3% of the motifs, while the  other 41 variables account for only 8.7% of the motifs.   The most commonly used techniques are white stencilling (26%), black outline and infill  drawing  (16%) and black  infilled drawing  (10%). These occur  in a great number of  sites, but  their distribution does not correlate with the relative frequency of their use. The technique which  represents the highest frequency of motifs does not occur in the greatest number of sites - white  stencils are found in 23% of sites; black outline and infilled motifs and black infilled motifs are  each found in c.60% of sites. Black outline (accounting for 6% of motifs) is found in 57% of  sites. Most of the red and white monochrome drawings (consistently a low-average proportion  of motifs present) are found in between 30-40% of the sites. Engraved intaglio motifs represent  only 1.7% of the motifs counted, but are found in 15.4% of sites. Linear infill is found in 1.3% of  motifs, but in 13.8% of sites.  To determine how this proliferation of variability correlates with overall assemblage size,  technique occurrence and assemblage size was investigated. This suggests that much of the  variability is not of temporal or spatial significance - since these techniques occur rarely, as one- off production episodes. Of the 41 variables which occur infrequently (&lt;1%: see Table 10.3):   8 (20%) are found at small sites;   17 are found at medium sized sites;   10 are found at large sites;   16 (37.6%) are found only at very large sites. terra australis 27 233 </page> <page sequence="6"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Table 10.1: Techniques and/or colour.

Of the 30 variables which occur at very few (&lt;5% of) sites:   3 are found in small sites;   10 are found in medium sized sites;   4 are found in large sites;   14 are found only in very large sites. More than half (57%) of these variables only occur at medium, large or very large sites. This  suggests that these variables result from chance development rather than specific stylistic phasing,  i.e. they are likely to result from greater frequency of artistic activity at large sites (and random  development) rather than as a result of changing artistic trends over time.  The three rare techniques which occurred only in small sites were analysed although none  of these are found in superimposition relationships with other techniques. These are:   #26 dry black outline, white infill   #37 dry yellow outline, black infill   #45 dry black, red and white outline, black infill The conclusions which can be reached on the basis of these analyses:   Most of the art in the Mangrove Creek valley can be accounted for by an abbreviated  list of 17 technique variables. These include the monochrome dry variables (excluding  yellow), white paint, red infilled paint, and combinations of red, white and black dry  bichrome techniques. White hand stencils are common; red and yellow hand stencils  are less common. The engraved intaglio technique is also quite common.   There is no direct correlation between most frequently used techniques and the  numbers of sites at which these techniques are used. This suggests that a few large  sites may be foci for both the development of certain technical combinations and for  a proliferation of these.   The most common techniques are rarely present in more than 50% of the sample  sites. This suggests that the art is relatively diverse and that there is no standardised  (i.e. culturally prescribed) technical formula for art production.   The small sites contain a range of common, average and rare techniques. These  sites have the potential for testing the combination of techniques which may have  temporal or spatial significance. terra australis 27 235 </page> <page sequence="8"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Table 10.3: mangrove creek shelter More can be made of these findings on the basis of the  art sites. number and % frequency of superimposition and multivariate analyses. motifs for each technique variable.

Most important amongst these are anthropomorphs  (13%) and goannas (7.5%), but a snake, a quadruped, and a complex non-figurative motif are also  present (2% each).  Phase 3 has a proliferation in the motif range and amongst these a dominance of macropods  (30%). Tracks, circles and ‘other’ motifs diminish significantly, and this shift is towards a greater  focus on figurative motifs (and a characteristic Darkingung motif assemblage: see chapter 9).  As the Phase 3 assemblage represented a much larger sample than the other two, a Student’s  t-test (designed to test whether differences between two populations may be the result of random  chance) was run to assess the statistical significance of their similarities and/or differences. This revealed the following statistics (df= 23):         Statistic (chi-)    Degree of Significance  Phase 2:   -0.2   0.88  Phase 3:   -3.0   0.006  Phase 3:   -3.1   0.005 This test indicated that Phases I and 2 are both very different to the later Phase 3. This result  shows that the differences between Phases 1 and 2 - as well as the differences between the earlier  two phases and the later one - are unlikely to be the result of chance. The differences between the  two earliest phases and the third are statistically significant.  The main phase (designated Mangrove Creek Art Phase 3: Table 10.7), contains a proliferation  of techniques. The production of new art appears to have been cumulative. New techniques have  not superseded older ones. It does not appear possible to archaeologically subdivide this major  artistic period into discrete temporal events.   Prior to this, however, there was an engraved phase and a pigment phase, both of which  may also have been temporally discrete. It is possible that pigment component accompanied the  engraved form, although tying these two together is difficult. The phased motif analysis shows that  these two assemblages are sufficiently different to warrant calling them separate populations.   This is supported by a low correlation between the two techniques occurring in the same  site (Table 10.9).

To view diachronic patterning in the Mangrove Creek pigment sites a cumulative frequency  analysis of these three phases was applied (following Attenbrow 2004, Morwood 1987). The art  in the 65 sites was categorised into the three identified phases (Table 10.9).  The sites with more than one phase were weighted to demonstrate where the focus of art  production lies. The number of shelters used in each Phase varies. Phase 3 has the largest number  of sites. Phase 2 has the smallest number of sites (Table 10.8). Multivariate Analyses The sample sites were subject to multivariate analysis. The variance displayed by the small sites  was considered important, given the assumption that these should be more sensitive to temporal  or spatial trends. Correspondence Analysis (CA) was employed for this purpose (Chapter 11  contains a detailed description of this technique).  All variables which were present at &lt;5% of the sites were clumped into generalised  categories and a reduced variable list of 35 attributes was analysed. This avoided the possibility  that the rarer techniques would force 95% of the data into a homogeneous indistinguishable mass  - thus masking any patterning therein. The revised variable list is shown (Table 10.9).   The CA results showed that the first two components accounted for 47% of the variance in  the data set. The scree slope plot (Wright 1992) demonstrates that the variance is well described  by this CA (Figure 10.4). 3 2.5 figure 10.4: mangrove  2 creek shelter cA results.

Technical variables  (excluding variable #32,  intaglio). 9)  medium sized sites contain assemblages which use predominantly black and red drawings  and have white hand stencils. These sites rarely have other coloured hand stencils  present; 10)  large sites contain a range of (mainly monochrome) techniques with white hand stencils,  and or pecked engravings; 11)  very large sites contain the full range of techniques employed in this valley; most of the  rarer techniques and colours are only found in these sites. The CA has demonstrated clustering of the sites based of colour and technique preferences. These  groupings do not indicate temporal trends – as determined by superimposition analysis.  These results appear to demonstrate how the art body in this valley system was produced -  namely that small sites contain limited artistic events created with a range of similar raw materials.  These appear to be ad hoc episodes producing art with whatever raw material was to hand (i.e.  the ubiquitous charcoal). Sites which represent more conspicuous art foci contain a wider range  of techniques and raw materials. The sites which have been used extensively for the production  of art demonstrate the full range of techniques and colours available to the artists in the Valley.  Increasing artistic complexity - while the result of repeated artistic events – does not demonstrate  an evolution of the style.  Two earlier art phases are supported by motif preference and superimpositionning analyses.  The separation of the pecked motifs from other techniques is also strongly supported by the CA.  No strong trends in colour preference or technique are indicated in the main art phase. Complex  sites appear to have been used for longer periods of time or for more intensive episodes of artistic  activity. The proliferation of techniques in these sites represents an accumulation of technical  options rather than an evolution of traits. The fact that the largest and most complex sites cluster  cohesively  (Figure  10.7)  demonstrates  an  overriding  stylistic  homogeneity  in  the  sites  of  this  size. A similar pattern is identified with the medium sized sites. These results are suggestive of  different types of art activity locations being identified.  mangrove creek Art Sequence Basis on superimpositionning, motif preference and multivariate analyses the following phases of  art production are discerned within the Mangrove Creek valley: Mangrove Creek Art Phase 1  pecked engravings of tracks and circles. terra australis 27 246 </page> <page sequence="19"> Chapter 10: Diachronic variation in the art of the Sydney Basin figure 10.7: Bivariate plot of  component scores, mangrove  creek. Small, medium and  large-very large sites plotted  separately. Mangrove Creek Art Phase 2  red paintings and hand stencils, and white hand stencils (red and  white hand stencils do not co-occur). Mangrove Creek Art Phase 3  a proliferation of techniques and colour use, perhaps starting  with plain dry black and dry red motifs and then developing into  a range of paints, dry bichromes, stencils of varying colours,  polychromes and incised motifs. Outline-only motifs end the  sequences of many shelter, although contact motifs have also  been recorded in white stencils and drawn red and white outlined  and infill forms. How does this art sequence correlate with occupation indices? Is it possible to propose an absolute  chronology based on the data obtained here? Definite comments about the earliest and terminal  phases are possible.  At Yengo 1 a date of c.6,000 years BP is given for Phase I (associated with a Pre-Bondaian  lithic assemblage). A pre-Bondaian association can also be inferred for Emu Tracks 2 in upper  Mangrove Creek, although this is not demonstrated by the excavation results. terra australis 27 247 </page> <page sequence="20"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange  At Emu Tracks 2, the 15 engraved emu tracks were recorded as being level with the current  surface  of  the  deposit. Here  the first major  occupation  of  the  shelter  began  sometime  around  4,000 years ago (Attenbrow 1987: Table 7.2). Regardless of the exact timing of the shelters first  usage, it would appear that the art’s position on the wall indicates that this was contemporaneous  with earliest usage of the shelter, predating the Early to Middle Bondaian occupation (see Table  10.10).   At the most recent end of the art sequence, there is evidence that pigment art was being  produced at European contact. Drawings of sailing ships in a range of colours and the stencilling  of metal axes indicate that the art in the Mangrove Creek valley was being produced as late as  1788, although 1770 (the arrival of Captain Cook at Botany Bay), is a possible pro terminus  (McDonald 2008).   Both Mathews (1897c) and McCarthy (1939) cite evidence of an Aboriginal person in  Wollombi Brook producing art as late as 1843, but there is no evidence that this was produced in  a culturally prescribed fashion. The ethnohistoric literature offers no evidence of people observed  producing art in the early days of white settlement. The fact that contact motifs are relatively rare  in the Sydney area suggests either that the production of art at this time was either sporadic, or  that the use of art as a cultural medium quickly diminished after contact.  There is an absence of associated evidence for Phase 2 art and the question of timing  between Phases 2 and 3 is problematic.   A correlation between art and deposit can be investigated at the seven excavated shelter  art sites in the Mangrove Creek valley, five of which have been dated30. From these dates and the  archaeological sequencing at each site, correlations between art and occupation phases can be  made (Table 10.10). This is not a simple exercise as the sites excavated by Attenbrow were not  excavated for this explicit purpose.   Of the five art shelters excavated by Attenbrow, four have multiple phases of occupation  and most have Phase 3 art. The site that has a single phase of both art and deposit is Bird Tracks  (Table 10.10). The art here is designated Phase 3, the deposit (undated) Phase 4 (Attenbrow 1987:  Table 7.2). If one assumes that the two were produced contemporaneously, Art Phase 3 at this site  dates to the last 1,600 years. Table 10.10: excavated shelters with radiocarbon determinations, estimated archaeological  phases and designated art phases. Site Dates Occupation Art Phases Phases Emu Tracks 2 - 2, 3, 4 1 Upside Down Man 4,030 ± 140BP 1, 1?, 2  1,5440 ± 60 BP 3 1,220 ± 120 BP 3 3 Roo and Echidna 6,700 ± 150 BP 1  - 2, 3, 4 3 Bird Tracks - 4 3 Black Hands 3,040 ± 85 BP 2 - 3, 4 3 Dingo and Horned Anthrop 581 ± 120 BP not analysed 3 Loggers 11,050 ± 135 BP 1 7,950 ± 80 BP 2 2,480 ± 60 BP 3 3 530 ± 90 BP 4 3 Three of the art shelters with multiple phases of occupation (Roo and Echidna, Black Hands and  Loggers) had their most intensive occupation during Lithic Phase 3 (2,800-1,600 years ago). There  is no direct evidence from these shelters to correlate the two forms of evidence. If it’s assumed  30While 18 shelter art sites were excavated by Attenbrow, the art in only five was recorded in sufficient detail for this  analysis. terra australis 27 248 </page> <page sequence="21"> Chapter 10: Diachronic variation in the art of the Sydney Basin that the production of pigment art coincided with the most intensive period of occupation, a  Middle to Late Bondaian association is suggested for the Phase 3 art in these sites.  More direct associations are possible from the remaining excavated art shelters. The presence of at least three artistic episodes at the Upside Down Man (UDM) shelter has  already been argued (above), while the dating and analysis of the deposit indicates two distinct  phases of use. The contemporaneity of the main phase of occupation (Lithic Phase 3) and the  majority of the art (Art Phase 3) is indicated on the basis of excavated evidence. It is also argued  that a late artistic episode, including a suite of outline motifs, one of which was AMS dated, may  well indicate that art production continuing after the abandonment of the shelter for habitation, c.  1,200 years BP.   The two pecked motifs at this site are figurative, unlike the majority of the pecked assemblage  in this creek valley. It is possible that these represent a ‘transitional’ form between Phases 1 and 2.  The relatively recent basal dates and the nature of the pre-Bondaian Phase 1 assemblage, support  such an argument. The early pigment art (with painted red anthropomorphs that are stylistically  similar to the engraved anthropomorphs) may be more closely related to Phase 1 and 2 motifs.  The UDM Phase 2 motifs are correlated with the earlier occupation of the site.  The main phase of Middle Bondaian occupation at UDM ends later than proposed by  Attenbrow’s (2004) sequence (i.e. between 2,800 -1,600 years ago). Similarly, the UDM early  Bondaian (Unit III) also returned a comparatively recent date (c.4,000 years BP). Using UDM’s excavated assemblage, the following dates are suggested for the art phases:     Art Phase 2  &lt;4,000 -&gt; 1,600 years BP     Art Phase 3  c.1 ,600 - 1,200 years BP The other shelter excavated expressly to date its art was Dingo and Horned Anthropomorph  (MacIntosh 1965). Two dates  (144 ± 125 BP  (GX-0069)  and 581 ± 120 BP  (GX-0070) were  obtained from one pit at this site. This site has the most conclusive excavated evidence for ochrous  art production in the Sydney region31. The faceted red ochre, of the same colour as the dingoes and  horned anthropomorphs, associated with the earlier date establishes the likely production date for  these motifs (see discussion above). The remainder of the art at this shelter (in a separate panel)  is classified as Phase 3. Its condition suggests that much of its production may predate the dingo  and horned anthropomorph composition. The horned anthropomorphs32, dingoes and echidnae  are classified, as late Art Phase 3. The dated evidence for this site indicates that these motifs were  produced midway through the last millennium, long after occupation in UDM ceased.  Based on Emu Tracks 2 and these two shelters with good correlations between art and  deposit, and given to the presence of contact motifs in the Valley, the following chronology for  the Mangrove Creek Art sequence is proposed:    Art Phase 1  Pre- or Early Bondaian   &gt; 4,000 years BP  Art Phase 2  Early Bondaian   &lt;4,000 – c.1,600 years BP  Art Phase 3  Middle to Late Bondaian  c.1,600 - European contact Difficulties were encountered in accurately pegging this chronology because of the scarcity of  sites with art in dateable contexts. There are inconsistencies in dating the stone tool phases both  in Mangrove Creek and in the broader region (see chapter 4). Art Phase 3 could have commenced  a millennium earlier than the dates proposed here: and the Late Bondaian transition may have  occurred later.  31Attenbrow 1987 (Sunny), Glover 1974 (2CU/5), Tracey 1974 (4cU/5) and Megaw and Roberts 1974 (WL/-]. 32This particular motif has an extremely restricted distribution in the Mangrove Creek catchment and near Mogo  Creek just to the west (Chapter 12).  terra australis 27 249 </page> <page sequence="22"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange  A correlation of art phases with broader lithic phases appears to be the most judicious  categorising of the material. Assuming that the main art production period in most sites is  contemporaneous with the most intensive period of stone tool production, the Middle Bondaian  is likely to be the peak art producing period. Art production certainly continued through the late  Bondaian and indeed up until contact. Art was produced in shelter contexts throughout this period  without appreciable stylistic change. The significance of this finding is discussed (Chapter 13), in  terms of the model for stylistic behaviour in the region.   terra australis 27 250 </page> </plain_text>
