Nature of Village Deities Introduction * The Santal 1 believe that the world is inhabited by a large number of spiritual beings of various kinds, called bonga, some of whom are directly connected with the welfare of particular persons or groups. The Santal have very vague notions about the individualities of the supernatural beings or bonga. One of the main reasons for this is that their relationship with these supernatural beings, except the supreme being Thakur, are shrouded with a feeling of taboo, mystery, secrecy and fear. The Santal of the village Kuapara 2, as elsewhereu, se the term bonga * The paper is based upon author's larger work on Santal social structure and religion for Ph. D. degree at Lucknow University. 1 Thanks to the works by Rev. P. O. Bodding and other missionaries, the Santal are one of the best known tribes of Chotanagpur, Bihar. They are related to other austric speaking tribes of the area, viz. Munda, Ho, Birhor, Kharia, etc. The Santal are now distributed over a vast area in Bengal and Bihar. For general account of the tribe see Culshaw 1949. 2 The field work, on the basis of which this paper is prepared, was conducted Anthropos 61. 1966 16</page><page sequence="2">242 V. Κ. KOCHAR Anthropos 61. 1966 indiscriminately for the various categories of spiritual beings - the creator, the "downright" evil spirits that hover about in the habitat, individual tutilary spirits, spirit doubles, ghosts, spirits of the deceased relatives, witches and even Hindu deities. Any kind of non-corporal, ethereal being may be referred to as bonga. The cognate tribes of Chotanagpur area, Bihar (viz. Birhor, Munda, Ho, Kharia) have similar usage. This usage has lead some to believe that all bonga designates are mani- festations of a single, all pervading, source of energy or power (Roy 1925; Majumdar 1942, 1950). Some believe that bonga do not have any personal attributes (Risley, p. 352). On the other hand some believe that the bonga are highly personate (Culshaw 1939) and are essentially evil agencies (Bod- ding 1925: III). My enquiries have led me to doubt these opinions so far as the Santal are concerned. The Santal do not talk about bonga even among themselves. Bonga in general are not a subject of discussion or theorization among the Santal. The names of bonga, the ritual procedures, incantations, and the material aids used for sacrifice, the sacrificial meal and its consumption, the sacred altar (than) of the deities - all these are charged with magical significance. I found it very difficult to collect details about the bonga as any query about these matters made even the best informants keep silent. This unwillingness emerges as much from fear as from the fact that their knowledge in these matters, in- cluding that of the priests, is very vague and uncrystallized. The Santal maintain varying kinds and degrees of relationship with these bonga: some bonga are worshipped by each family in its sacred enclosure (bhitri), others by the village priest in the sacred grove (jaher), some of them are worshipped by other persons such as the assistant priest (kudum-naeki) , the headman of the village (manjhi) or the magician-cum-medicine-man (ojha), and others at definite occasions in the yearly cycle or casually when necessary. Worship hereafter is used in special sense peculiar to the Santal connoting the ritual acts associated with the propitiation of the bonga. I shall describe below a definite group of bonga associated with village community as a whole. Some of these, common to the whole tribe, are described here as jaher-bonga. Others, localized spiritual entities, are described as "other village deities". As will be shown below, each village deity 3 is endowed with some indi- vidual characteristics which mark it from the other bonga. Such distinguishing features are not verbalized by the Santal but are implicit in their behaviour with respect to the different bonga, and have to be inferred from it. during the period 1958-60 in the village Kuapara near Santiniketan in Mauza Surul of Suri subdivision of district Birbhum, W. Bengal, India. For general details about the village see Kochar 1964 a. 3 I have described certain bonga as "deities". There are numerous bonga but all are not deities. Of these few are assigned specific abodes and are worshipped at scheduled occasions in a scheduled manner. Bonga with whom the Santal maintain such structured or formalized relationship have been termed here "deities". The term as applied here does not necessarily involve anthropomorphism, pantheistic derivation or devineness.</page><page sequence="3">Village Deities of the Santal and Associated Rituals 243 1. Ritual in the Sacred Grove Jaher-than (or johor-than) is a sacred grove near every Santal village where the village priest (naeki) offers periodic sacrifices to the principal deities of the Santal pantheon. Some sal and mahua 4 trees are left uncleared at the time of setting of the village and are made abodes of the bonga. Some plastered space, often with a small piece of stone or a little raised platform at the foot of these trees, represents the abode of the respective bonga. The primary act before settling a village is the selection of the sacred spot and offering sacrifices to the bonga. If the signs and omens through divinations prove that the bonga have accepted the offerings and are pleased with the selection of the spot, the village is established; otherwise not (Skrefsrud; cf. Bodding 1940: 429-30). In the jaher-than there should be, according to traditional rules, three sarjom "sal" trees in a row assigned to Marang-Buru, Jaher-Era and Moreko- Turuiko. There should be another tree, preferably a matkom "mahua" tree for Gosaen-Era and another for Par gana- Bonga. There are thus altogether five trees in the jaher grove selected as seats or abodes for the deities. The grove is usually situated in the west end of the village. In Kuapara, however, jaher- than has been shifted thrice since the village was established. The original jaher- than, I was told, was in a cluster of trees. The present jaher-than is situated amidst the eroded khoai land about 250 yards north-west from the village settlement (for description of jaher see O'Malley, p. 141; Culshaw 1949: 80-81). There are no trees in the present jaher except a few shrubs of one to three feet height, under which the abodes of these jaher-bonga are established. Sometimes, the than "seat" for sima-bonga may also be provided in the jaher but in Kuapara area the abode of sima-bonga is located on the outskirts of the village where the village street ends. Worship and sacrifice to the jaher deities in Kuapara is performed by the naeki, the village priest, at the time of principal festivals, namely, erok, sohrae, magh, and baha. Traditionally, sacrifices to the jaher deities were performed at all the festivals. The jaher grove is not cleaned or looked after except at the time of worship. No symbols or emblems are placed in the jaher. It is reported that in Bankura area the Santal take regular care of the jaher grove and place earthen effigies near the than in Hindu fashion (Culshaw 1949: 80). I did not come across such a practice in Kuapara area. I have learnt that a similar practice is in vogue in Malda and Dinajpur districts of Bengal (according to information provided by Tribal Welfare Officer, District Birbhum). In Kuapara no flags, clothes, strings, etc., are attached to the trees in jaher. In Bankura, strings are tied to the trees assigned to sima-bonga but no such practice is found in this area. At the time of sohrae and magh festivals a thatched booth (5' χ 4' χ 4') is erected at the sacrificial altar in the jaher. Sometimes a bamboo stick is fixed in the ground; it is said that this keeps watch over the place and is called laga thakur. It is taboo for women to enter into the jaher grove because it is believed that they may try to control the bonga through witchcraft. 4 The botanical name for sal is Shorea robusta and for mahua Bassia latifolia Roxb.</page><page sequence="4">244 V. Κ. KOCHAR Anthropos 61. 1966 The dates for worship at jaher are decided informally by the goret "messen- ger" of the village. Every house in the village is expected to contribute some rice for the sacrificial meal and a small fowl for sacrifice. These things are collected by the goret a day before the appointed day for sacrifice. The village priest (naeki) is expected to observe some taboos. He has to sleep on the ground on a mat and has to abstain from sexual intercourse on the night before sacrifice. On the day of the sacrifice he takes a bath early in the morning and wears a newly washed cloth (dhuti). He does not eat anything before the sacrificial meal is cooked. For the worship at jaher the naeki takes some sal leaves, vermilion, cowdung, adwe 5 rice grains, wheat flour, tengoi (sickle-shaped knife with foot- hold) for cutting the fowls, all put in a winnowing fan, and a metal pot con- taining water. The goret of the village carries fowls to be sacrificed and rice for cooking the sacrificial meal in a basket. The naeki is accompanied by some village officials such as jog-manjhi, paranik, bhogdar and kudum-naeki. The accompanying persons carry the fowls and animals for sacrifice. The villagers do not accompany the naeki and his party. They wait for them on the outskirts of the village and make preparations for the cooking of the sacrificial meal. On reaching the jaher-than the naeki cleans the spot at the foot of each tree which is regarded as the abode of the particular bonga. After cleaning the spot with his hands (no broom is used) he applies cowdung mixed with water, making a circular mark of six inches to one foot in diameter. He then places a small flat piece of stone, about two to four inches square, within this cleaned circle after dipping it into water. Having done this the naeki squats on the ground in front of the circle with his right leg folded under his hips and his left leg flexed in front of his shoulders. He holds the tengoi under his left foot. He makes a small circle with wheat flour within the plastered space and puts vermilion mark with the third finger of his right hand on the tree, on the stone, and within the white circle made with flour. He then puts some adwe rice grains in the circle and takes the sacrificial fowl. He puts vermilion mark on its head, right wing, and foot and holds the fowl in his cupped hands. He makes a bow and extends his cupped hands with the fowl towards the stone piece. Having thus bowed to the bonga he holds the fowl near the circle so that its head is just above the white circle in which some rice grains have been placed. He holds the fowl in this position and mutters the incantation till the fowl has eaten some of the rice placed in the circle. After this, he cuts the head of the fowl with the tengoi and places the head into the white circle. Simultaneous- ly he holds the trunk of the fowl above the circle so that a few drops of blood fall upon the rice placed in it. The trunk of the fowl is handed over to the goret who keeps it in a basket. In the end, the naeki washes his hands and bows with folded hands to the bonga. The other persons present do not make any move- ments and sit silently. But they join the naeki in final obeisance to the bonga. The same series of actions is repeated again and again under each tree in the 5 The adwe rice grains are husked without boiling. This variety is used for ritual purposes. The variety used for cooking is usna which is partially boiled before husking.</page><page sequence="5">Village Deities of the Santal and Associated Rituals 245 jaher and propitiations are offered to all the bonga in turn. The heads of the animals and fowls sacrificed are collected by the naeki in his winnowing fan while the bodies of fowls and animals are kept by other persons. The same incantation is uttered for each bonga except the name of the particular bonga. The incantation as I recorded in Kuapara runs as follows : Johar [Jaher-Era] tobe nokok inj imam "Salute to you then, Jaher-Era, I am giving kana. Niye gi khusi ko me. Attu mahandare you this now. Be pleased to accept it. In the duka apa aloyem bolok uchho soro uchhoye. village no misery let enter, let come." There is one exception to be noted. One of the sacrificed fowls is not beheaded completely but only partially. This style of sacrifice is called jeba (cf. the word zibah, a practice among the Muslims). In Kuapara this is reported to be done for Jaher-Era. One priest, however, related that it is done for Moreko- Taruiko. In Bankura it is done for Manjhi-Haram although Culshaw notes that there may be a mistaken identity with Moreko-Turuiko (Culshaw 1949: 105). None of my informants could assign any meaning to this specific treatment and at no other occasion this mode of sacrifice is adopted. My guess is that the term turuiko in the name Moreko-Turuiko though it literally means "six" might in some way be associated with turuk (Muslim) and hence they adopt the peculiar mode of sacrifice. The traditions state that there were some wars among the Santal and Muslim rulers in Champa ; the peculiar mode of sacrifice may have something to do with that period of contact with turuk. The sacrificial meal is prepared by the villagers on the outskirts of the village. Proportions are made and allocated to the respective representatives of the households. The naeki takes for his share the white fowl sacrificed to Gosaen-Era and the red fowl sacrificed to Moreko-Turuiko and goret gets one head. They cook these fowls separately and consume them separately. The head of a sacrificed goat or a pig is also consumed by the priest. In Bankura and elsewhere the heads of all the sacrificed fowls are consumed by the priest (Culshaw 1949 : 106) ; but in Kuapara, except those mentioned above, these are cooked with the rest of the meal and consumed by the male population of the village. As it is apparent from the above incantation to jaher deities, the sacri- fices are made by the village priest on behalf of the whole village. The village officials, especially the goret, also play an important role. Other villagers do errand jobs connected with the sacrifice and the cooking of the sacrificial meal. The naeki is thus the ritual spokesman for the whole village. He alone keeps the taboos necessary for sacrificial purification. The procedure of jaher worship varies somewhat at certain occasions, especially at baha, sohrae and erok festivals. The essentials of the ritual are the same but these are accompanied by other ceremonial details and accessory rites. At baha, flowers are also used for worship and booths are erected at the jaher-than. In other places elaborate dancing processions accompany the naeki to the jaher-than where the role of different bonga are enacted by the "possessed" individuals (rum-bonga) (Skrefsrud, pp. 182-190; Culshaw 1949). Purification rites are also performed before the jaher sacrifices. But none of such elaborate</page><page sequence="6">246 V. Κ. KOCHAR Anthropos 61. 1966 ceremonies are performed in Kuapara area. At the time of the sohrae festival the jaher worship is accompanied by rituals connected with cattle worship - a ritual shared with some low castes of Bengal (Bhowmick, pp. 49-50) . At the time of the nawae festival in some areas the sprouts of new paddy ears are offered to thejaher- bonga and to family deities. The festival is no longer performed in Kuapara area although it used to be performed there sometime in the past. At the time of the erok festival, which is a rain-making ritual, special offerings are made to Moreko-Turuiko and bahre-bonga. 2. The Jaher Deities According to the Santal traditions, the Santal did not worship any bonga in the beginning; they worshipped only Thakur. First they started worshipping Marang-Buru. Later, at Champa, the tribe adopted Moreko-Turuiko, Gosaen- Era and Jaher-Era and enshrined them in the jaher -than. It was then that under a sal tree they learnt from these bonga the right way to live (Skrefsrud, p. 10; Campbell). Kolean Guru gave a hierarchy in the following order: Marang-Buru (whose real name is Lita), Jaher-Era (whose real name is Ram-Salgi), Moreko- Turuiko, Gosaen-Era, Pargana-Bonga (Skrefsrud, pp. 159-160). I enquired from three priests of Kuapara area the order of precedence at the time of actual worship of the bonga in the jaher. There were some minor variations in their statements but the groupings were consistent. Sacrifices are made in the following order: Jaher-Era, Gosaen-Era, Moreko-Turuiko, Par gana, Manjhi- Haram, Marang-Buru and bahre-bonga. The position of Marang-Buru is not definite but it is interesting to note that Marang-Buru who is characterized in traditions as the highest deity is not classed in Kuapara with proper jaher deities and is instead classed with bahre-bonga. The Pargana- and Manjhi-Bonga are personalized deities analogous to counterparts in tribal organization; Parganait being the head of the Pargana, and Manjhi-Haram being the head of the village. One informant classed Marang-Buru with these bonga. Jaher-Era, Gosaen-Era and Moreko-Turuiko are accorded the highest status among the village deities (besides Marang-Buru). The statements by some priests and the actual conduct of rituals support my contention that this primary group of deities is somewhat different from other village deities. I have, therefore, designated these four bonga as jaher deities in contradistinction to other minor village deities. There are some families of certain sub-clans (khut) of the Santal who worship village deities as their abge-bonga, but these families do not worship all the village deities; they offer sacrifice only to the three above mentioned deities. The ex-priest of a village belonging to the naeki-khil sub-clan offers sacrifices to the three jaher deities in his bhitri at the time of baha and nawae festivals (Kochar 19656: 63). MARANG-BURU: The position of Marang-Buru in the Santal pantheon is an important one, but his exact place in the hierarchy is, at the same time, not clear enough.</page><page sequence="7">Village Deities of the Santal and Associated Rituals 247 Since Marang-Buru is accorded libations and sacrifices on various occasions connected with various levels of social existence, namely, the individual, family, clan, community, and the tribe, the status of Marang-Buru in the Santal pantheon is somewhat independent of his placement in the jaher group of bonga. This is one of the few bonga of the Santal who have a mythical background. Some authors have assigned a high place to Marang-Buru, next only to the creator Thakur (Culshaw 1949: 109; O'Malley, p. 146). Kolean assigned the third place to Marang-Buru (Skrefsrud, p. 159). Whenever a Santal sits to drink rice-beer (handi) he, first of all, sprinkles a few drops of handi as an offering to his ancestors and to Marang-Buru. This act is associated with their myth of origin. When the first pair of human beings was wandering aimlessly on the surface of the earth, Marang-Buru appeared before them and introduced himself as their grandfather. He taught the first human pair, Pilchu-Haram and Pilchu-Budhi, to cultivate, to dance, to hunt and to brew rice-beer (Campbell, pp. 18-20). Among the Santal, joking relationship exists between the grandparents and grandchildren, and it is one of the most affectionate relationships. Marang-Buru as a grandfather and guardian of the first human pair is regarded as a "good old fellow" and pre- sumed to be a benevolent deity. Marang-Buru is never revealed in the divina- tions as the originator of evils. Another myth narrates how the worship of Marang-Buru was started by the Santal. It is said that once the tribe lost its way in course of its wander- ings, surrounded on all sides by a mountain. They failed to find their way because, as they say, the "big mountain" obstructed their path each time they made an attempt to cross the valley. Finding no way out the tribe promised to worship the spirit residing in the "big mountain" and called it Marang-Buru "the big hill". Subsequently the tribe found its way out, and since then the tribe has kept its promise by worshipping the bonga (cf. Bodding 1926:67). In another myth Marang-Buru is portrayed as the chief of all the evil spirits in the world. It is said that originally all the bonga were the messengers {goret) of the high god Thakur. They used to work according to his orders. Marang-Buru was the bonga in whom Thakur confided most. However, there was some tussle of power between the bonga and Thakur. The former, it is said, demanded greater authority. Thakur became angry and threw all the bonga from the sky down on the earth. The bonga fell here and there ; some on trees, some into rivers, some on hills, and so on. Marang-Buru fell on a big mountain. He became the leader of all the bonga on earth. Under his authority the bonga have been, from time immemorial, obstructing the deeds of Thakur and obstructing the normal course of human life (Bodding 1926: 68). The three mythical references to the Marang-Buru-Bonga given above reveal three different characterizations of Marang-Buru. One reveals the bonga as an affectionate and benevolent grandfather who taught them the true way of life; the second reveals the bonga as one to whom the tribe is bound with gratitude for opening their path, and the third reveals the bonga as the chief of all the evil spirits who obstruct the acts of high god and instigate men into bondage to evil forces.</page><page sequence="8">248 V. Κ. KOCHAR Anthropos 61. 1966 Offerings and worship for Marang-Buru are made in the jaher-than by the village priest on behalf of the whole village. Marang-Buru is one of the five principal deities of the Santal. Offerings to Marang-Buru are also made at the time of bhitri worship by the families. Although no sacrifice is made in bhitri worships in Kuapara village to Marang-Buru along with other family deities, such sacrifices to Marang-Buru were offered in the past at the time of the sohrae festival (Skrefsrud, p. 172). Libations to Marang-Buru are made whenever the Santal drink rice-beer. This is the only deity who receives libations by every individual; all other deities are offered libations on behalf of a group. Marang-Buru is also associated with hapram (ancestors). At the time of umul ader (bringing in the shadow) ceremony in course of funeral rites, two persons become possessed, one by the deceased individual and the other by Marang-Buru. The possessed spirits, called rum bonga, are welcomed formally by the persons and are offered libations of water and rice-beer. The spirit of the deceased one is then requested to tell the reason for its departure. Associa- tion of Marang-Buru with the spirit of the deceased one, as dramatized on the occasion, is an evidence of the affinity of the bonga with the ancestors which has its sanction in the origin myth as being the grandfather of the first human pair. The different components of the individuality of Marang-Buru is proba- bly due to the fact that in the worship of Marang-Buru we have more than one association and meaning superimposed on the other. Worship of Marang-Buru, both as a family deity and as a jaher deity needs some explanations. Jaher deities are the deities of the village and tribe as a whole but the family deities belong to the respective families alone. The concept of ownership of the deity, or rather the concept of validity of the worship of a deity for a particular group, is marked in the Santal rituals. Every deity is ritually associated with a definite group. Group affiliation of Marang-Buru is, however, not clear. Among the Birhor, Marang-Buru is a family god "amongst some families" (Roy 1925a: 313). Buru-bonga or the spirits of the hills in general are acquired as orak-bonga among certain clans among the Birhor. "These are the spirits of the different hills reputed to have formed the original homes of the different Birhor clans" (Roy 1925a: 300). Totemic symbols are also used on these occa- sions of clan sacrifices (Roy 1925δ: 165-66). These practices among this most backward tribe of the Munda group perhaps show that in the early stages of their wanderings the Munda tribes acquired buru-bonga (hill bonga) as clan deities. The Santal as a whole, forming a section of the original Kharwar or Mundaric people, probably comparised a single clan or subtribe in remote past. Roy has conjectured that Marang-Buru among the Munda is the accumu- lated totemic symbol of the different clans residing in a localized region. "At this stage", Roy writes, "the Buru-Bonga or clan gods of the different clans settled within an area of several miles appear to have merged into high god or general deity called by the Munda, Marang-bonga or Marang Bum" (Roy 1925&amp; : 173). Among the Munda and Santal, Marang-Buru is a high god. Munda myths describe this bonga as the elder brother of Sing- Bonga, the latter being identified with supreme being Thakur. Among Ho, Marang-Buru is a minor</page><page sequence="9">Village Deities of the Santal and Associated Rituals 249 clan deity (Majumdar 1950: 258). Among Birhor, Marang-Buru or buru- bonga are reckoned as orak-bonga (Roy 1925a : 300) . Among the Munda of Tamaria region, as reported by Roy, the buru-bonga are reckoned as killi- bonga or clan gods (Roy 19250:173). In this light the hypothesis of correlation between Marang-Buru and the clan groups is suggestive enough. The clan group cuts across familial, community and the tribal relationships. The propitiation of Marang-Buru among the Santal at the three levels also indicates in this direction. MOREKO-TURUIKO: Moreko-Turuiko is actually not one bonga but a group of bonga - five brothers and six sisters, named collectively as Moreko-Turuiko, literally, "five- six". The "Five and Six" are somewhat loose-tempered bonga in whom the Santal take more than casual interest in comparison to other jaher deities. Sometimes, some families in the village perform sacrifices and libations in the honour of Moreko (the abridged name of the bonga) in their bhitri at the time of erok and baha festivals. They invite their agnatic kin specially for the occasion. It is reported that in some places an occasional festival was held in the honour of the bonga; the name of the festival being mak more (Bodding 1935 : 212-13) . No evidence of such practice was, however, available from Kuapara area. Moreko is offered sacrifice at all the jaher worships. In Kuapara, a fowl sacrificed to Moreko is eaten only by the village priest. Individual sacrifices to Moreko are generally made only by those families which make such promise or oath at the time of illness. The decision is taken on the advice of the ojha who declares the necessity of such a sacrifice after his divinations about the cause of disease or distress. Sometimes the whole village jointly offers collective sacrifice to the Moreko at the time of an epidemic or cattle disease. This was done in all the villages in this area in 1959 when a cattle epidemic spread in the area. It may be noted that Moreko-Turuiko is the only jaher deity which is revealed in the divinations of the ojha and held as the cause of personal or general crisis. The special fear of the bonga and the special treatment accorded to it is due to this reason. The "Five and Six" are treated as a single bonga or deity and only one sacrifice is made to them. The fowl sacrificed to Moreko is not beheaded com- pletely but partially. Actual names of the "Five and Six" bonga are not known. A group of five male and six female bonga grouped together and designated by a single name is an interesting phenomenon in the Santal pantheon. Tendency to group similar deities and to assign them common appellation is a concurrent phenomenon in the Santal religion. Although they are vaguely conceived to be a group of bonga, the actual ritual behaviour and emotional responses are made as if the group represents a single bonga. This involves abstraction towards collective personification of the atomistic individualities of bonga. I have noted the same fact with respect to orak-bonga, abge-bonga and patta-bonga elsewhere (Kochar 19656). From their general statements about Moreko, my informants conveyed the impression that the "Five and Six" are a kind of</page><page sequence="10">250 V. Κ. KOCHAR Anthropos 61. 1966 bahre-bonga of some ancient habitat of the Santal. The bonga are attributed to have control over rains, crops and epidemics. The baha songs given by Kolean clearly associated Moreko-Turuiko with rains and welfare of the country (Skrefsrud, p. 187 f.). JAHER-ERA: The individualities of Jaher-Era and Gosaen-Era are more vague. The Santal did not (or they could not?) seem to know much about these female deities of jaher. Jaher-Era presides over the jaher grove, tends the other bonga in the jaher-than and looks after the interest of the villagers. In myths her proper name is given as Ram-Salgi which associates her with the Hindu deity Ram. Whether this association refers to a mere superimposition or derivation is difficult to say. She is considered as "good old lady in charge of the jaher grove". At the time of baha festival, it is reported from other areas, three young men become possessed, one by Jaher-Era, and the other two by Marang-Buru and Moreko-Turuiko. The possessed individuals dress themselves in specific way and dramatize different activities. The dramatization reflects the SantaFs notions about these deities (such dramatization at the time of baha is not practised now in Kuapara area). The man representing Jaher-Budi or Jaher- Era is dressed like an old lady. "She" takes a broom and a basket and sweeps the jaher grove. At another stage of dramatization, Jaher-Budi washes the feet of the naeki and other persons (Skrefsrud, p. 183). She thus appears to be the most humble of all jaher deities. She is not attributed any special power and I could not find any such indication in the literature either. She is not held responsible for disease or welfare. Her role appears to be like that of a caretaker. GOSAEN-ERA: Still less can be said about Gosaen-Era. In Kuapara, she is vaguely associated as the wife of Gosaen or Thakur - the supreme god of the Santal. As reported by Kolean, at the time of baha festival two booths used to be erected - one for Moreko, Jaher-Era and Marang-Buru, and the other for Gosaen-Era. At the time of dramatization of bonga, no person is possessed by the spirit of Gosaen-Era. At the time of all jaher worships a white fowl is sacrificed to Gosaen- Era. The head of this fowl is cooked with rice and eaten by naeki only. The baha festival appears to be vaguely connected with Gosaen-Era although the Santal do not appear to be aware of any such explicit connection. There is striking similarity between the description of the baha festival as given by Kolean, and the worship of "earth goddess or the spirit of vegetation" at the time of spring festival observed among the tribes of Chota- nagpur as described by S. C. Roy. When flowers and new vegetations sprout up, the goddess of the sacred grove of the village was "ceremonially married to the sun god, the village priest acting as the proxy of the latter and his wife of the former ... On the day of annual Khaddi or Sarhul festival she is conducted in procession on her winnowing basket from the village priest's house to the sacred grove" (Roy 1928: 69).</page><page sequence="11">Village Deities of the Santal and Associated Rituals 251 The ceremonies observed in Kuapara and adjoining villages at the time of the baha festival are not so elaborate as described for Santal living in Santal parganas (Skrefsrud, pp. 182-190) and Bankura (Culshaw 1949: 103-110) ; as such, many points are concealed or shadowed in my own data. Many features of this festival are in a way highly exceptional in the sense that nothing like these takes place in any of the ceremonies or rituals connected with the bonga : Taking the priest to the jaher grove in a dancing procession, the possession of three men by the jaher deities, and their direct participation in dan- cing and ritual, importance accorded to the priest and his wife, worship of flowers in the jaher-than, washing of the naeki's feet by Jaher-Era, stay of the naeki in the jaher all alone till evening when he is brought back to the village in a dancing procession, the consumption of the sacrificial meal by the naeki's wife in jaher, and finally the honouring of the naeki in each house of the village and the distribution of the 'Vater of luck" brought from jaher. The whole procedure is, as I see it, very much different from the Santal concept and practice of bonga worship, at home or in the jaher. Most of these features, on the other hand, remind us of the flower festival or spring festival of some tribes of Chotanagpur as described by Roy. In the absence of any myths, any direct or indirect reference to, or association with the fertility concept, and in the absence of any coherent explanation of these practices by the Santal themselves, we are unable to assign a definite meaning to the ceremonies outlined above. But the whole series of events, otherwise unexplained, becomes meaningful when viewed in the context of Roy's above explanation. Among the Santal, however, the roles of Jaher-Era and Gosaen-Era have got mixed up. Roy connects these cere- monies with the "goddess of the jaher". I have noted above that among the Santal the principal guardian deity of the jaher is Jaher-Era and her status is that of a humble old lady. Her role through the possessed individual at the time of baha is inconsistent with the high status of fertility goddess in whose honour the baha ceremonies are performed. Roy's explanation of the flower festival as being the marriage of the deity with the sun-god, suggests that Gosaen-Era is the corresponding deity among the Santal. Gosaen-Era and not Jaher-Era is regarded as the wife of Gosaen, the high god of the Santal. A separate booth used to be erected for Gosaen-Era at the time of baha festival in the days of Kolean and the fowl sacrificed to Gosaen-Era at the time of all jaher worships is consumed by the priest himself. These bits of evidence suggest that the deity which may be connected with the role of fertility goddess, as suggested by Roy's explanation, is Gosaen-Era and not Jaher-Era. But among the Santal, Gosaen-Era is not conceived to be the "goddess of the jaher" ; it is Jaher-Era who is conceived to be the guardian deity of the jaher. While the Santal have more definite ideas about Jaher-Era they seem to know little about Gosaen-Era. Jaher-Era is somewhat closely associated with the village community. Both Jaher-Era and Gosaen-Era are regarded as benevolent deities.</page><page sequence="12">252 V. Κ. KOCHAR Anthropos 61. 1966 3. Other Village Deities The jaher deities described above are common for the whole Santal tribe although the worship at jaher is valid for a particular village only. There are other village deities who are collectively propitiated on behalf of the whole village but the individuality of these bonga is implicitly different in different villages. MANJHI-HARAM-BONGA : Manjhi-Haram-Bonga is regarded as the spirit of the original founder of the village. The statements given by some of my informants seemed to imply that this bonga stands for the spirits of all the village headmen starting from the founder headman to the present alive headman. A couple of decades ago the manjhi-than was situated near the house of the original founder headman of the village Kuapara. Now it is situated near the house of the present head- man. The manjhi-than of Kuapara is a mud platform about six inches high, three feet broad and four feet long. There is no structure on or around it as perhaps found in other areas (O'Malley, p. 141). There is ample open space around the than. Village meetings, dances and games are generally held in this open space. At the time of marriage the outgoing and incoming parties have to pay obeisance at the manjhi-than. Sacrifices are performed at the manjhi-than by the headman only on the occasion of principal festivals. The sacrificial animal is provided by him alone. The head of the sacrificed animal is consumed by the headman and the rest of the meat can be sold off to the villagers. In fact he is expected to invite village elders for meat and rice-beer at his own expense. An unmarried girl from the headman's house cleans and plasters the than before the sacrifices are offered. No clay effigies or stone emblems are kept at the than in Kuapara; this seems to be the practice in Bankura and Murshidabad (Culshaw 1949 : 82 and personal communication from T. W. 0.) Sacrifices by the headman at the manjhi-than are regarded as his personal duty. The spirits of the earlier headmen of the village are a kind of tutelary spirits for the present headman. He derives validation of his office and authority from the ritual communication he maintains with his deceased predecessors. Sacrifices to Manjhi-Haram-Bonga are also offered by the naeki at the time of jaher worships. Some informants illuded it to be worship of the bonga of the manjhi-haram (implying the alive one too) . A vague spiritual counterpart is attributed to the headman by the village people. This was, however, denied by the headman himself. There is no other instance in Santal religion of the worship of the spirit of a living person at an altar. According to Santal religious concepts a person cannot become a bonga unless cremated with full honours. The bonga is regarded to be specially connected with village welfare. It is a benevolent bonga and seldom revealed in divinations by the ojha as a cause of some general distress. The bonga is also deemed responsible for the welfare</page><page sequence="13">Village Deities of the Santal and Associated Rituals 253 of the headman and his family. On such divinations the sacrifice is offered to the bonga by the headman. Any conspicuous neglect by the headman in making sacrifices at the manjhi-than is noted by the villagers with concern and the village council may be moved to press the headman for this. PARGANA-BONGA: The Pargana-Bonga has special significance for the Santal because the bonga is regarded as the head of the witches ; as a kind of tutelary guardian of all the witches. It is said that witches worship the Pargana-Bonga to get training and proficiency in the art of witchcraft. The witches have to invoke Pargana-Bonga and take his permission and well wishings for their actual missions. It is said that in their night meetings the witches bring Pargana- Bonga dressed like a king. The Pargana-Bonga is easily susceptible to the enticements of the witches. The bonga assists them in their misadventures. Pargana-Bonga has, it is said, influence over the minor stray bonga of the region and can direct them against human beings at the request of witches. The Pargana-Bonga is supposed to reside in the funeral ground of the village where the witches generally hold their meetings. Sacrifices to Pargana-Bonga are made in the jaher-than at the time of principal jaher rituals but the sacrificial ritual is performed by the assistant priest kudum-naeki. At the time of general illness, or when there is some trouble in the village on account of witches, the ojha may offer magical sacrifice to the Pargana-Bonga. The modus operandi and the personnel involved in the propitiation of Pargana-Bonga at or outside the jaher is different from that adopted for the jaher deities by the village priest. The role of Pargana-Bonga has apparently nothing to do with the office of the parganait. Κ parganait is the jurai and social head of the administrative unit pargana. He acts as the head of the inter-village council of headmen and generally deals inter-village disputes or some outstanding inter-village matters. It appears to me that nomenclatorial similarity of the bonga with the particular office incumbent in political organization is only an analogy. The bonga does not represent the spirit of any parganait as is the case of Manjhi-Haram-Bonga. Perhaps the bonga is named so because it holds the same status among the stray minor bonga of the region as does the parganait over the people in the pargana. But no such suggestion was available from the Santal of Kuapara. SIMA-BONGA: Sima-bonga are the bonga of the outskirt or village boundary and are worshipped by the assistant priest called kudum-naeki at definite occasions. The sacrifices are made on behalf of the whole village. Sima-bonga are regarded as very furious bonga. Sometimes definite trees are marked for the sima-bonga at the end of the village street where the sacrifices are given to them. It is reported that in Bankura specific trees assigned to the sima-bonga are marked with threads at the time of festivals (Culshaw 1949 : 80) but this is not the practice in Kuapara. Sima-bonga are a group of bonga and constitute a cate-</page><page sequence="14">254 V. Κ. KOCHAR Anthropos 61. 1966 gory by themselves. There are three such bonga in Kuapara but I was unable to get the proper names of them. The bonga are treated as a single entity and collective sacrifice is given to them. If the bonga are revealed in the oil divina- tions as a source of trouble for a family or the whole village, the respective group offers sacrifices to the sima-bonga through the ojha. This ritual is more complicated than the ritual performed by kudum-naeki at scheduled occasions. Sima-bonga are considered so furious that they are propitiated with human blood. The mode of sacrifice, called bul-mayam, is different from that followed by naeki. Kudum-naeki goes alone at the spot and secretly performs the ritual. Sun-dried rice is placed on a sal leaf and put before the particular tree or shrub with proper incantations to the bonga presumably on behalf of the whole village. Kudum-naeki then pricks his thighs, arms and, if necessary, chest with thorn. He drops his own blood on the rice grains placed on a sal leaf until the rice is soaked with blood. Each time the same incantation is uttered. BAHRE-BONGA: Bahre-bonga are the bonga of the outskirts living in the area surrounding the village. Favourite abodes of bahre-bonga are pools, ditches, streams, ponds, a deserted house or land or grove or tree, tree stumps, old funeral sites, holes in the ground, hillocks, pits, mounds, etc. Each bonga is known by the specific name and sex. Some bonga are specifically known to be more furious. The abodes of these bonga, which are known by the villagers are avoided. Some of them are known by their specific predisposition towards specific human actions- a knowledge which is shared by all the villagers including females. These bonga are similar in character to bhut-bonga "ghosts". There is, however, essential difference between the two. There are about twenty such bahre-bonga living in the area around Kua- para. Knowledge about these bonga is shared by the adjoining villages who share the habitat. The distant villages have different bonga "living" in "their" area. The Kuapara Santal do not recognize these distant bahre-bonga though they may be aware of them. This is reflected in a kudum-naeki 's statement, "there are bonga near railway line but we do not name them (at the time of sacrifice)". A collective sacrifice is offered to these bonga by the naeki in Kuapara at the time of jaher worship. At the time of er ok festival sacrifices are offered to important bahre-bonga by name. The mode of sacrifice is similar to that adopted by the naeki for other jaher deities. The bodies of these fowls are included in the sacrificial meal along with other fowls sacrificed to the jaher deities. In some instances the bahre-bonga may be revealed in the divinations as cause of some distress or disease. In that case sacrifice is offered by ojha on behalf of the patient.</page><page sequence="15">Village Deities of the Santal and Associated Rituals 255 4. Nature of Village Deities Santal have very vague notions about the character and function of the different village deities. We are reminded of Risley's remark about these deities: "All over Chota Nagpur, we find sacred groves, the abode of equally indeterminate things, who are represented by no symbols, of whose form and function no one can give an intelligent account" (Risley, p. 352). The remark, in a way, is correct, but at the same time, as I have shown, it is possible to arrive at some idea about the character and function of these deities sufficient enough to differentiate between them. It should inhibit us from hasty conclu- sion of the type Risley has arrived at. There are definite individual attributes, however vague, associated with each deity. These notions have to be built up on the basis of their behaviour at the time of actual performance of the rituals connected with the deities. The inability of the Santal to spell out, in precise terms and concepts, the exact nature and function of their deities does not mean that they do not differentiate between the different bonga. Conclusions based upon merely verbal responses may be very misleading in such instances. Among Birhor, Roy has noted, the village collectively acquires some bonga just as families acquire new bonga (Roy 1925&lt;z: 316). A similar process seems probable for the Santal deities too. I have elsewhere commented upon the acquisition of orak-bonga and abge-bonga by individual families (Kochar 1965&amp;). Similarly, the bonga who are deemed to have significant bearing upon welfare of the village and the tribe as a whole (positively or negatively) have been given place in the jaher-than which signifies highest ritual recognition of a bonga. This is more explicit in the case of bahre-bonga and sima-bonga. I have treated "jaher" deities separately from "other village deities". The ritual status of jaher deities is higher than of other village deities. 1. The jaher deities are tribal deities; their individuality being shared by the whole tribe. The individualities of other village deities are localized either through persons or through surroundings. 2. The jaher deities are worshipped by naeki alone. Other village deities are/can be worshipped by others. 3. The jaher deities, except Moreko-Turuiko, are benevolent and are not revealed in divinations while other village deities are malevolent, except Manjhi-Haram-Bonga who is equivocally benevolent. 4. The ritual treatment of jaher deities is different from that of other village deities. 5. While the jaher deities live in the jaher-than, the other village bonga have their abodes elsewhere. The latter are given place in the jaher for propi- tiation on account of their significance for the village welfare. Despite these differences all the above mentioned Santal deities have one thing in common. Their propitiation involves the whole village directly or indirectly. Worship of village deities is village affair. The ritual bond between these deities and the village community as a group is marked. Jaher-than, the</page><page sequence="16">256 V. Κ. KOCHAR Anthropos 61. 1966 worships, the associated festivity at some occasions, the consumption of the sacrificial meal, the representation of the group by a selected officiant for the worships - all these are symbols of community identity. The sacrifices to the jaher-bonga are performed by the village priest on behalf of the whole village. The selection of the priest is made ostensibly by the bonga themselves who possess an individual and express their choice through him. Every village has a jaher-than and no two villages share the same than despite the fact the deities are the same. The association of a village with a jaher expresses the ritual unity of the group. It is, among the Santal, an impor- tant criterion for ascertaining community membership and community boundary. I have come across some villages where there is apparently no spatial distance between the hamlets but the whole settlement is divided in two or more ritual groups with clear-cut demarcation of membership. The ritual unit maintains some amount of political and social unity as well. The village Kaligonjo, for example, on sight appears to be a hamlet of the village Kuapara. There is no marked spatial distance between the two settlements. But the two settlements constitute two separate communities by the criteria of ritual, political and social segregation. In Kalitola, a village about two miles from Bolpur, I found within the same cluster of houses as many as three distinct socio-ritual groupings with separate jaher-than and separate priests. The three sections of the village community, in fact, originally belonged to three different villages which have been brought together due to floods in their original habitat. The three separate clusters have maintained their ritual identity although spatially, economically and socially these represent a single village community. The jaher is established by the original settlers after careful divination (cf. Bodding 1940: 429-30). The jaher-bonga are everywhere the same but due to their constant association with a particular village, the jaher-bonga of every village are implicitly attributed distinctiveness from the same bonga in the sacred groves of other villages. The jaher-bonga of one village are not worshipped by the mem- bers of another village. What matters more is ritual association of the whole village, role of village officials, in particular that of the village priest, and joint sacrifice and consumption of the sacrificial meal. The group of original settlers responsible for the establishment of jaher-than associates itself more closely with the jaher. If one or more families move from one village to another, they acquire relationship with a new jaher, but if the group of original settlers moves en-bloc to some other place they generally establish their own jaher deities in the new habitat. There is, however, no idea or act prevalent among them suggesting physical "carrying away" the bonga with them as is found among the Birhor (Roy 1925a : 295). The jaher-bonga are the same all over the Santal tribe but the jaher-bonga of no two villages are the same in terms of ritual identity and ritual validity for the group. Relationship with bonga as a symbol of societal status is discussed elsewhere (Kochar 19646). The village deities, associated rituals and ceremonials thus symbolize as well as dramatize community bonds and internal differentiation within the community.</page><page sequence="17">Village Deities of the Santal and Associated Rituals 257 Bibliography Bhowmick P.
