<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Pleasure of Reading Ovid Elaine Fantham, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Oxford Approaches to Classical Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2004), 178 pp. This is a charming booklet. For people who have not yet read Ovid's poem itself this approach to it (serving as "an appetizer", as the author hopes, p. ix) is a seduction to do so now and for those who have read it and even for scholars who have studied it and flat- ter themselves to know the epic, Elaine Fantham's (F.) representation offers surprises and is again and again an eye-opener. She retails Ovid's stories in such a refreshing and pen-</page><page sequence="2">416 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Winter 2006 etrating way that they come out new and fascinating and display details the memory of which had become blurred or even void. That is at least what happened to this reviewer. It should be added that part at least of the charm of the Ovidian narration as F. presents it is due to A.D. Melville's translation of the Metamorphoses, which is used for excerpts; being German I did not know that translation, which is obviously poetic and elegant.' Having no general criticism of the work2 I shall accompany it with short descrip- tions from chapter to chapter, underscoring what I regard as especially illuminating, and adding occasional remarks on further or deviating interpretation. 1. Translations of Greek and Latin literature rarely cross linguistic borders, the exceptions being literary classics themselves such as T.E. Shaw's [Lawrence of Arabia] Odyssey [1932] or William Adlington's Golden Asse (1566] which are known and being read by German classicists. English speaking readers may like Friedrich Schiller's translations (1791/92) of the second and fourth books of the Aeneid. 2. Some errors in details and minor slips (skipping misprints): Phaethon' sisters (met. 2,345ff.) are transformed into trees; Ovid does not name the species, poplars (pp. 34, 69, and 106), because he wanted to enrich the story with another aition, that of amber, into which the Heliads' tears are changed (met. 2,364f.), and poplars do not exude resin. - Semele was provoked "to ask Jupiter to prove his love by letting her see him in the full form with which he makes love to Juno" (p. 39). But does " see "not deprive the story of its point and render it too innocuous? If da mihi te talem corresponds to qualem Saturnia [. . .] te solet amplecti, Veneris cum foedus initis (met. 3,293f.) the natural understanding of these verses is that Semele was to ask the god to have intercourse with her as the god of lightning: corpus mortale tumultus I non tulit aetherios donisque iugalibus arsit (met. 3,308f.) does not tell how mortal eyes suffered from divine splen- dor but how the mortal body burnt from the ardent god's "shudder in the loins" of the human girl. - p. 76 on Orpheus: "Before Virgil the myth had celebrated his successful recovery of his bride". This is an error. Phaedrus in his speech in Plato's Symposium gives this account (179 d 2-4): "But Orpheus, Oiagros' son, they (sc. the gods) sent back unsuccessful from Hades, showing him a phantom of his wife for whom he came, but not giving her real self [..]" (translation by W.H.D. Rouse). - p. 82, 1. 5 from bottom: "The simple piety of Deucalion and Pyrrha is reproduced in affectionate detail in book 8", a phrase everybody would subscribe to thinking of Philemon and Baucis, were not F. continuing thus: "and then another narrator, Lelex, describes the hospitality shown by the old couple Baucis and Philemon [... .1." - Nessus' garment is soaked in his blood and Hercules' arrow-poison (met. 9.130,158); that Nessus' blood itself was "venomous" (p. 95) is not in the text. - p. 100, 1. 3: instead of "his son" (sc. Jupiter's) read "her son" (sc. Venus') or "his grandson" (cf. met. 14,588f.). - p. 108, 1. 4 from bottom: in- stead of "Phillyra" read "Philyra". - It sounds a bit peculiar when in the section on Pythago- ras' lecture the phrasing "the evil killing of souls" follows on the paragraph which stresses that the Ovidian philosopher teaches: "the soul is immortal" (p. 115). - It seems strange that The- ocritus, Idyll 6 should be named for Galatea's appearance in classical literature before Ovid (p. 129): Idyll 11 was much more famous and influential (cf. Virgil, Eclogue 2, where, however, also lines of Idyll 6 are used); and Ovid himself in telling the story of Acis, Polyphemus, and Galatea quotes and alludes (besides to the Odyssey) above all to id. 11 and ecl. 2 (as well as ecl. 7,37-40: address of Galatea). Therefore, the text should be corrected to: "Idyll 11 (and 6)". When F. later is talking of Polyphemus' love song (address of Galatea, praise of his grotto, his gifts) it becomes clear that she has Idyll 11 in mind. The reader should be warned that the references to line-numbers in the poem are often in- correct. The reviewer has shunned the labor of a systematic control, but can give a list of those references he detected as wrong where he wanted to have a look at Ovid's text: p. 53, 1. 2 from bottom: instead of "6.59-60" read "6.61-67". - p. 55, last line: instead of "6.581" read "6.582". - p. 63, 1.4: instead of "11.203-5" read "12.203-5". - p. 85, 1. 6: instead of "line 587" read "line 688"</page><page sequence="3">Review Articles 417 The book is divided into ten chapters which are followed by two Appendices, of which the first surveys "Ovid's Poetical Works", the second gives an "Outline of the Metamorphoses". At the end there is an "Index of Persons" (figures in the poem; ancient and modern authors and artists). Chapters 2-8 deal with themes of the Metamorphoses and consist mainly of paraphrases. They are framed by two chapters on the general character of Ovid's poem in the context of ancient poetry and literary history. Chapter 10, on the re- ception of Ovid's epic, is loosely connected with the preceding introduction into the poem and serves as an appendix. In the opening chapter, "Transforming Bodies, Transforming Epic" (pp. 3-20), a first section is devoted to the "Prologue" (met. 1,1-4). F. reads illa in 1.2, Lejay's conjecture to re- place illas, exchanging one difficulty for another. When she cites Melville's "Of bodies changed to other forms I tell" (in nova [. . .] mutatas [. . .] formas I corpora with ab urbe con- dita construction) she might have pointed to Ovid's linguistic image of a metamorphosis. By singing of how forms were changed into bodies the poet does not imply that the forms were without body or the bodies without form. He chooses two synonyms for start and re- sult of the process of transformation. Under the heading "Transforming Epic" the second section gives a survey of transformations in ancient epic poetry and of poetry of transfor- mation and how Ovid reshaped the tradition. Chapter 9 (pp. 119-132), "Genre and Narra- tive: Ovid's Polymorphous Poem", returns to literary history. It regards "the generic and stylistic range of hexameter poetry" (p. 119) and offers most helpful remarks on Ovid's "different types of narrative and levels of seriousness" (p. 121), mainly-in the wake of Brooks Otis' influential book on the poem3-the "generic colors" of "epic grandeur" and elegy (p. 123), but also on humor and the tone of comedy. There is a penetrating assess- ment of met. 13,750-897, Galatea's narrative of herself in the love triangle with Acis and Polyphemus (pp. 129f.). F. demonstrates how motives from Theocritus, Idyll 11, in the Latin pastoral language of Virgil, Eclogue 2 are overlaid with epic allusions to the Odyssey and Aeneid, book 5. And in the course of chapters 2-8, F. refers again and again to Ovid's models from Homer to Virgil, including Greek tragedy and Hellenistic poetry. These chapters supply a review of the poem under thematic headings. It is crucial to realize that F. did not extract these themes from the epic as a whole; she represents them each as a group or sequence of tales, not necessarily connected among each other in a nar- rative continuum, but occupying certain stretches of the poem. Therefore, F. does not ap- pear to subdivide the epic into separate unities. The guiding view of the blueprint for the epic takes seriously the poet's announcement of narrative continuity (met. 1,4: perpetuum [...] carmen) and does justice to the reader's impression of a gradual thematic and at- mospheric change in the progress of reading. This metamorphotic character of Ovid's new type of epic is to be ascertained from F.'s observations of a first occurrence of a theme at different stages of the poem (with the implication or explicit statement that further occurrences will soon follow). Cf. e.g. p. 122 on met. 1,452: "Talk of the god's first love suggests that there will be other love stories"; p. 66 on Procne in book 6: "she is the first woman in Ovid's narrative to plan and commit murder, and the first of a series of women to dare criminal acts"; p. 74: "With the story of Medea that opens book 7, Ovid introduces his first love-struck girl [...] as a model for what will be a series of women in love"; pp. 95-97 (see below on chapter 7). (book 7).- p. 96, 1. 2: instead of "9.151" read "9.158-161". - p. 96, 1. 8 from bottom: instead "9.204-5" read "9.203-4." - p. 108, last 1.: instead of "737-8" (book 10) read "738-9". - p. 125, 1. 13: instead of "7.155" read "7.154". 3. Brooks Otis, Ovid as An Epic Poet, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 19661, 1970'.</page><page sequence="4">418 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Winter 2006 Other explicit statements on thematic change in the poem are found e.g. on p. 44: "most of the girl victims in the early books are nymphs"; on p. 65: "The first-and only-rape by a human comes in the transition from divine vengeance to the evils that humans inflict on each other [. ..] in book 6"; on p. 74: "there can be no doubt that what Brooks Otis (1970) called 'the pathos of love' is the heart of the central section of Metamorphoses, from the Tereus episode in book 6 to the end of book 11"4. As there are beginnings in the continuous stream of narrative there are naturally also ends, none as evident as the following: F. has a section called "The Ubiquity of Rape" in chapter 5, where she sensibly states: "Sexual pursuit is so recurrent in Metamorphoses that Ovid's achievement of variety is an index of both his skill and his audience's taste" (p. 64). After all those stories of nymphs in the early books one may consider Arachne's tapestry with "more than twenty scenes of women raped by Jupiter, Neptune, Apollo, Bacchus, and Saturn" (p. 54). But even a diffuse memory of the poem will somehow recall that the theme tapers off in the course of the narrative. The ultimate termi- nation of rape occurs with the story of Neptune's rape of Caenis in met. 12,189-209. With the fulfillment of the wronged girl's request never to experience rape again (cf. pp. 62f.) -she is transformed into a man-rape is abolished for the rest of Metamorphoses. Chapter 2 (pp. 21-35) deals with "Creation, Flood, and Fire", i.e. with Ovid's Cos- mogony, his story of Jupiter's punishment of sinful mankind, and the consequences of Phaethon's rash desire to steer the solar chariot across the sky. F.'s survey of the cos- mogony with which Metamorphoses opens stresses two aspects: (i) "the universe was made for man" (p. 24) and (ii) the creator is represented as an artist (p. 26). This is most important. In Ovid's poetic Weltanscuhauung man is the center and focus of the world. This anthropocentric basis is developed in two sets of aetiological myths. The first explains the existence of a world apt for human life with a story, the poetical invention of an origin for the universe. This myth illustrates why and how the universe came into being and be- came a world for the humans to live in. The second is a continuous series of aetiological transformation stories which explain the anthropomorphic character of the beings in the world, telling the origin of their human meaning. The meaning of the world is best un- derstood through aetiological poetry: The anthropocentric notion of a world appropriate for man is founded in the cosmogonical story of a god who is creator and artist; the an- thropomorphic view of the meaning of the world, full of beings of human character and fate, is founded in the poetic tradition and Ovid's renewing art. These two mythological complexes need another set of aetiological myths in order to make up the structural framework of Ovid's poem. These are the stories that offer an an- thropology. The first set is placed at the end of the cosmogony as its culmination (met. 1,76--88). F. says (p. 25), "the poet is undecided" whether man was made from divine seed or from a mixture of earth and heavenly seeds. Indeed, Ovid does not decide the issue; he needs both these aitia. And he will need many more in order to establish the anthropo- logical and moral basis for all the different characters of his epic and for all the transfor- mations from apotheosis and catasterism to changes into rock and marble and pebble. Thus he offers first four more species of humankind, the morally and culturally diverse types of man as exhibited in the four metal ages, after that the giant-blood man, and fi- nally the stone-man with the specific point that only with the postdiluvial story of Deu- calion and Pyrrha does mankind enter the epic in the diversification of man and woman. The sequence of all these stories is not an historical one, and tales told later do not super- sede the myths before. Just as the great flood does not alter the meaning of the cos- mogony, all the later stories of the origin of man do not abolish the first stories in the cos- mogony but add up, together with them, to give an adequate view of mankind. 4. The expression "section" is clearly not used in the technical sense of a separate unity.</page><page sequence="5">Review Articles 419 "Ovid's 'Theban cycle'" (p. 37) is the subject of chapter 3, "Cadmus and the Tragic Dy- nasty of Thebes" (pp. 36-50). F. characterizes the tragedies that happen in a city which is seen as "a counterpart of Rome in its genesis in civil war and association with Mars" (p. 37). The last section of Chapter 4, "Human Artistry and Divine Jealousy" (pp. 51-60), is devoted to "Pygmalion as Creator". F. is clear in recognizing that the animating of the statue is due to Venus and the sculptor's love. Nevertheless she asks (p. 60): "How far is this story a myth of artistic creation, and how far a simple miracle of piety rewarded?" Her answer is that the miracle is "a less serious expression of Ovid's belief in the powers of art than the myths of poetry and music that both precede and follow it." My answer would go beyond that: This is a story of the animating power of love, not of art; it deals with artistic power only insofar as Pygmalion is a great artist and part of his love for his statue may be that philautia which underlies the love of artists for their own works. Chapters 5, "The Lives of Women" (pp. 61-73), and 6, "Aspects of Love" (pp. 74-88), have already been touched upon. There is, however, much more to them. After starting with tales of sex change, F. deals with "The Ubiquity of Rape", a section which culmi- nates in the story of Tereus, "the dreadful tale of incest, murder, and cannibalism" (p. 65). Quoting met. 6,556-62, she comments: "There is no more gruesome picture in Ovid's en- tire work" (p. 66). The next two sections, "Becoming a Mother" and "The Mother Be- reaved", reveal F.'s interpretive sensibility which finds ist general expression in the phrase: "Ovid devotes more concern than most poets to the mother and child during ges- tation and labor" (p. 67). The sections of chapter 6 are: "Tragic Tales of Divine Love for Boys", "The Wicked Passion of Girls", "Venus and Adonis" and finally "The Sorrows and Consolations of Mutual Married Love", in my view the most moving part (leaving it open whether this is the merit of F. or of Ovid). "Heroes-Old Style and New" is the title of chapter 7 (pp. 89-104). After the four classic heroical adventurers Perseus, Theseus, Jason, and Hercules, it turns to Aeneas, Roman rulers and apotheosis. Hercules with his apotheosis, "the first real deification of a mortal" (p. 95) in Metamorphloses, is the hinge between two sets of heroical deeds, those of Greek mythology and those of Roman history and present experience: The Greek hero Heracles is also a Roman god (F., p. 94 refers to Aeneid, book 8), "Rome's first human god" (p. 97), and his apotheosis is the model for "Rome's own deified heroes, starting from Aeneas" (p. 96). F., at pp. 97f., draws attention to the attribute augusta gravitate veren- dus (met. 9,270) of the transfigured Hercules; Ovid invites his readers to grasp thus that the hero foreshadows "Rome's present imperial ruler, known since 27 B.C.E. as Augustus, and in Greek as Sebastos, Latin verendus." In Ovid's narrative of Aeneas, it is his virtus that wins the hero the apotheosis (met. 14,581). F.'s remark (p. 99) that Ovid speaks of Aeneas' "valor", where Virgil would have said "piety," is pertinent: For the point is that apotheosis as the "highest kind of meta- morphosis" (p. 97) is the outcome and reward of virtus. Hercules is the model; the "finer parts" (met. 9,269 and 14,604; p. 97) which are purified (cf. met. 9,265: tantumque lovis vestigia servat) correspond to the "divine seed" (p. 25) of the first anthropogony. It is be- cause he "concentrates on his (sc. Aeneas') transformation into a god" that the poet calls him Cythereius heros, "born of Venus", both when he introduces him (met. 13,625) and when he begins the report of his apotheosis: tempestivus erat caelo Cythereius heros (met. 14,584)5. The mortal parts of the heroes are washed away, with Hercules (met. 9,264 f. and 268: mortales Tirynthius exuit artus), with Aeneas (met. 603: quidquid in Aenea fuerat mortale, 5. Modelled on Philyreius heros (met. 2,676) in the same metrical position, the end of the line after the caesura hepthemimeres.</page><page sequence="6">420 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Winter 2006 repurgat), with Romulus (met. 14,824f.: corpus mortale [.. .] dilapsum)6, with Caesar (met. 15,840: hanc animam [ . .] caeso de corpore raptam), with the poet (met. 15,873 f.: illa dies, quae nil nisi corporis huius I ius habet) whose 'finer parts' (met. 15,875: parte [...] meliore mei; cf. F., p. 97), i.e. his poem, will reach the stars and be immortal. In chapter 8, "Fantasy, the Fabulous, and the Miraculous Metamorphoses of Nature" (pp. 105-118), F. illustrates "the fabulous, the miraculous, and the monstrous" ingredi- ents of Ovid's poem, first the "Monsters and Marvels" of the "discourse of wonders" (as Stephen M. Wheeler calls the epic7), after that "Allegorical Personages", and finally "The Miracles of Natural Change". In the second section F. retails most suggestively the en- counters with Jealousy, Hunger, Sleep, and Rumor, their descriptions and their habitats. Ovid competes openly with Virgil only in "the last of his extended personifications" (p. 113), and only there his portrait is without a "narrative purpose" (p. 114). As to the long "lecture (or sermon) attributed to Pythagoras", F. is cautious in her assessment. She is certainly right in taking Ovid to have seen "it as an important part of the meaning of his poem" (p. 114). This statement seems to be a tacit correction of the notion, as put for- ward e.g. by Ernst Zinn, that Pythagoras' speech is the 'key' ("Schliissel") to the under- standing of the Metamorphoses8. To me F. seems also to be right in opposing the view that the lecture is absurd; there is no mockery here. She suggests "that Ovid has colored with academic eccentricity a fundamentally well-conceived lecture" and closes with the state- ment: "As stimulus to the imagination this lecture offers a dazzling tour, reviving the miraculous aspect of the everyday while exciting the fancy with other, more fantastic wonders of the world" (p. 118). Going a little beyond, I would submit that Ovid, the en- cyclopedical poet, supplements his treasury of mythical, i.e. poetical, transformations, stories of anthropological, moral, psychological meaning, with a survey of natural changes, of metamorphosis in the physical world, including natural history. As in Lu- cretius, De rerum natura, book 5, human cultural development forms part of that history, so do in that speech the rise and fall of empires and the transience of cities. To write a chapter of 19 pages on Ovid's central role in the classical tradition (Chap- ter 10: "After Ovid" [pp. 133-151]) may appear daring; but F. freely admits that she "can only pick a small sample of works that have themselves been the subject of many books" (p. 133). She has limited her scope to Italian art (including 4 figures), with the exception of Peter Breugel ("The Fall of Icarus", also on the cover), and to literature in English lan- guage (with substantial quotations from John Hollander and Ted Hughes) with one ex- ception: Franz Kafka's famous novella on Gregor Samsa's transformation into a cock- roach. Here a review cannot attempt to fill the lacunas. The reader is referred to the bibliography (pp. 150f.). One observation shall be mentioned because it may provoke thought (p. 150): Neither Ted Hughes' Tales from Ovid (1997) nor Mary Zimmerman's the- ater production of the Metamorphoses in New York (2002) cover any Roman story of the poem, let alone "the final invocation of divine protection for Augustus".
