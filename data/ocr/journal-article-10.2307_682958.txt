<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHEN NNE UKO WAS ASKED why she was known to dress like a man, she responded, Yes, I like that question! I used to dress like a man because by creation I was meant to be a man. But as it happened, when coming into this world I came with a woman's body. That is why I dressed that way. [Awa n.d.b] This is the story of Nne Uko Uma Awa, a woman of the village of Akanu-the largest of the villages of Ohafia, Nigeria.' In the course of Nne Uko's life she often dressed in men's clothes, but this was the least of her distinguish- ing characteristics. Nne Uko married two wives, joined various men's societies including the celebrated Ekpe (leopard) society, and gained the right to dance with men when they performed the Ohafia warrior's dance. While female husbands are relatively common among the patri- lineal Igbo (Talbot 1932:195-196; Uchendu 1965:7), they are rare among the Ohafia Igbo, where agricultural land is largely held by maternal descent groups.2 Nne Uko is known in her community as a dike nwami-a term which in Ohafia is variously translated as "heroine," "warrior woman," and most frequently as "brave woman." The common assumptions of Ohafia people regarding dike nwami and Nne Uko's interpretation of her own life add provocative new voices to the anthropological literature on female husbands. Nne Uko's story, however, does more than enhance our understanding of woman-to- woman marriage. Her reflections on her own life can be read as a heuristic guide pointing toward a richer under- standing of the play of individual, societal, and contingent events in the constitution of social praxis. Legendary Warrior Women The ancestors of the Ohafia people were renowned as mighty and ruthless warriors. In precolonial times Ohafia men were not considered to have attained full status as adult males until they returned from war with a human head as a battle trophy. Under the leadership of the Aro chiefs, Ohafia troops waged war on other Igbo- speaking groups to the north and west of Ohafia in the 18th and 19th centuries (Isichei 1976:83; McCall 1992:55). This period of internecine warfare ended with the commence- ment of British colonial rule in the region in the early 20th century, but the Ohafia still identify with the warrior legacy.3 They continue to employ the traditional rites once used to celebrate successful warriors, honoring young men in the community. Drawing a parallel between these modern markers of achievement and the practices of the ancestral warriors, those who sojourn into the world out- side of Ohafia and eventually return with university de- grees or great wealth are said to have "taken a head" and are celebrated with the traditional Ohafia war dance (McCall 1992:71-72, 1993). While the dance is performed, a vocalist sings epic narratives recounting the legendary exploits of ancestral heroes of Ohafia, warrior heroes who provide idealized images of masculine courage and ac- complishment. Many of the epic songs, however, also include accounts of women, some of whom are called "the great mothers" (Azuonye 1974:510). War dance singers recount the story of one such mother, Ugoenyi, who loses two sons in battle. Fearing for her third son, she dresses him as a girl so that he will not be taken to war with his age mates. His peers, however, discover the masquerade and take him by force. When he returns victorious with a trophy head, his mother's joy is such that she raises a great celebration in his honor for which special music and dance are created. This, it is said, is the origin of the war dance (Azuonye 1974:490-494). The epic motif of brave deeds as catalyst for a trans- formation from feminine to masculine is also associated with women who adopt the characteristics of warriors themselves. They are dike nwami, brave women who go to the battlefield, risk their lives, and take trophy heads like their male counterparts. Structurally parallel to the heroic return of Ugoenyi's son, their transmutation of gendered behavior and their heroic actions transform tragedy into celebration. Such exceptional characters and circumstances are often central to myth and legend. An initial setting in which the normal order of things is skewed or reversed often constitutes the project of the narrative itself: a resolution of order. This is certainly the JOHN C.

Taking a head in battle, he puts things right by doing what is appropriate for an Ohafia man to do. He becomes a man by acting like a man. These warrior heroes embody traditional values with which men identify and refer directly to their own sense of themselves as Ohafia men. Head taking, reprehensible in the present-day context, is dissociated from its actual practice and is reconstituted in performance as an icon of masculine attainment. For men, achievements considered to be equivalent to head taking condense a diverse cluster of values such as personal accomplishment, courage, and the incorporation of power. The legendary heroines pre- sent a more difficult problem. In Ohafia, motherhood is considered to be the definitive marker of womanhood. The dike nwami, however, achieve recognition through heroic acts. The epic of Inyan Olugu, as recorded by Azuonye, recounts the story of a young woman whose husband had not taken a head in battle. She vowed that she would take a head herself and give the honor to her husband. She went with her husband to Nkalu, a place where the people spoke "neither Igbo nor in stammer." Upon arrival, she sent her husband up a palm tree to pick fruits for her. While he was there, five Nkalu men approached. Inyan Olugu took her husband's gun and killed all five, cutting off their heads and putting them in a "long basket."4 She told her husband of her accomplishment, and when they returned to their village she took the heads to the great ikoro, the massive slit drum where trophy heads were traditionally honored. The warriors of the village came to sing the praises of her husband, but she told them to sing not only his praises but also the praises of Inyan Olugu, "she that kills and packs in a long basket, the woman who won heads and gave the honor to her husband" (Azuonye 1974:405-408). Likewise, the epic of Nne Mgbafo tells the story of a woman who, when her husband did not return from battle, dressed herself like a warrior and went to Ibibioland in search of him. She found her way to the scene of the battle and searched among the heaps of headless corpses for the body of her husband. Accounts of her adventure vary. In one version she finds her husband's body, buries it, sacri- fices a goat, and then later captures a man and sacrifices him on the grave as well. In other variants she finds her husband has been taken prisoner and intimidates his cap- tors so aggressively that they release him to her. In an- other version she finds her husband alive but learns that he had taken no head in battle and so, like Inyan Olugu, she decapitates a man herself and gives the head to her husband as his own trophy (Azuonye 1983:348-368). In each case she returns home triumphant and is celebrated by her community as a dike nwami (Azuonye 1983:348- 368, 1990:68-69). These stories of women who fulfill the Ohafia ordeal of manhood in spite of their sex seem to celebrate an overthrow of cultural norms rather than providing a reso- lution. These women do what men should have done but failed to do; they are driven by circumstances to defy the limits of the feminine role. The relationship between leg- ends of Ohafia heroism and the construction of male identity in everyday life is explicitly drawn by Ohafia people when the war dance is performed for successful men. However, the question remains: How do these "brave women" of legend, also generalized cultural archetypes, relate to the particular life experiences of women in Ohafia? Like the dike nwami of old, the people of Akanu stressed that Nne Uko was an exceptional woman-one distinguished from others by her heroic actions. A Living Legend When I went to Nne Uko's compound I brought cooked meat, fish, and a bottle of gin, as is customary when visiting a prominent elder. My arrival attracted much attention in the compound. Though I had made prior arrangements for the interview, I had to explain my visit to a large group of Nne Uko's kinspeople. Many insisted that they should be included in both the meeting and the feasting. One of her brothers argued that his presence was essential if we were to get the whole story. The negotia- tions were adeptly managed by my friend and research collaborator Ibe Nwosu Kalu. Throughout these prelimi- naries Nne Uko remained, in chiefly fashion, in her hut. At length I approached her home accompanied by a large entourage. It was ostensibly a typical Ohafia female abode, a bedroom and kitchen divided by a partition. But the new metal roof and wooden shutters contrasted with the thatched structures around it, indicating that she was a person of means. Nne Uko greeted us with a broad smile. She was an elderly woman, probably in her late seventies or early eighties.5 She was dressed in elegant women's clothing: a white blouse with eyelet lace at the neck and an imported wrap skirt embroidered with metallic thread. Her un- wrapped head revealed a crown of hair as white as chalk. Despite her advanced age, her eyes were bright and atten- tive. Her features possessed a fineness that could not be obscured by her many years. Perhaps sharing my thoughts, Ibe whispered to me, "She was a beautiful woman in her time." As we waited for the others to assem- ble I observed objects of particular significance in the room-things that were not usually found in a woman's hut. On one wall hung an akparanja, the traditional cut- lass of Ohafia warriors. Near it hung an mma ji, a yam knife, now practically obsolete as a tool, but which still serves as a trophy indicating recognition as a great yam farmer.6 Also prominent was a fmely carved nkpa, or walking stick, decorated with velvet, an accessory nor- mally carried by a "big man" of great achievement. When</page><page sequence="3">A BRAVE WOMAN / JOHN C. MCCALL 129 everyone was seated and had exchanged greetings, Nne Uko requested the gin. A young man produced a small shot glass and, filling it to the brim, handed it to her. With a steady hand she began tipping the glass slightly, sprinkling gin on the floor and speaking these words: Father Uma Awa Ogba, Father Digbo Odo, Kalu Uma Awa, Awa Uma Awa, here is wine. Agwu Uma Awa, here is wine. Mong Ogba, here is wine. Father Uma Awa Odo, here is wine. Ukariwe Uma Awa, here is wine. It is me Uko Uma Awa It was you who prepared me to act I am not acting on my own power. It is by the power you have given me that I act. My father and mother raised me to live as they lived. John, man of America, Man of Utugokoko, Man of my town, He has come today, Orie Ohafia Uduma Ezema. Today is One, the day my father used to farm yams. He has come to know Uko Uma Awa. May things go well for him in the morning, And may they go well in the evening. Father, may things go well with his son who was once here. May things go well with his wife and with his baby. Chineke, Obasi above, Life for the great person, Life for the small person.7 With these formalities complete, Nne Uko began to explain to us her belief that she was "meant to be a man." Curious to find the source of this conviction, Ibe asked her, "Was there anything that made you decide that you should act as a man? Because in your childhood you were seen to be very agile and strong and very manly in behav- ior."8 Nne Uko replied, One's interests are apparent in childhood. I was interested in manly activities. I cannot tell where this came from, this understanding that I was meant to be a man. But I took up manly activities because I was drawn to them. In those days, when a maiden came to the age of marriage she stayed in the fattening house for three years.9 At this time I completed all the maiden rites including gbu ewu [literally, "to kill a goat"]. It is one of the ceremonies that must be done before a woman is wedded.... I completed all the requirements of maiden- hood until I reached womanhood. After attaining womanhood I went as my nature was given to me-to behave as a man. Even in her participation in the girls' coming of age ceremonies, Nne Uko distinguished herself as one who excelled in manly accomplishments. Accounts of the events surrounding these ceremonies came to me from various sources. An elderly ritual specialist named Kalu Omiko told me that when the rites for girls were per- formed in those days, a group of boys who were their age mates were required to go on a ritual hunt and catch a species of small antelope known as anwg. 10 They had to capture the creature by hand so it could be brought back alive and sacrificed at the shrine of Kalu Akanu (Kamalu), the force identified with thunder and lightning, and the tutelary deity of the village of Akanu. But in the year of Nne Uko's coming of age, something happened that trans- formed the character of the ceremony. That year, a woman in the compound that held the priesthood of Kalu Akanu had a prophetic dream. In this dream Kalu came to her and demanded that this time the antelope must be captured by the girls of the age set rather than the boys. Dreams are the channel normally used by spirits to de- mand sacrifice, and women are often the receptors of such requests, which cannot be ignored.11 So that year, against all precedent, the ritual hunt was conducted by girls. For Nne Uko, who had always joined the young boys in competitions and hunting games, this divine interven- tion was taken as a personal challenge and an opportunity to excel. She recalled, The aru. nsi, Kalu Akanu, demanded a sacrifice. And the sac- rifice required was an animal called anwu. which the young women had to catch by hand. This was a fast animal but we were required to catch it. I was the leader ofthe hunt.... When we went I dressed in an Qnu. gwe [warrior's loin cloth] and an okpu agu. [warrior's "leopard" hat]. I tied on an akparanja [warrior's cutlass] in a sheath.... I was the leader dressed as a warrior man.... Then we went down to the village, marched around the village, and ?mally hung the aniwu. on Kalu Akanu. After that I often dressed in that way. It was on this occasion that Nne Uko first became known among the villagers as a dike nwami-a brave woman-the same term used to refer to the warrior women of legend. By dressing as a warrior for the ritual hunt, Nne Uko employed bodily presentation and the symbolic potential of clothing to link herself with the Ohafia warrior legacy. By acting as a warrior she boldly seized upon the most powerful and exclusive markers of Ohafia heroism, as celebrated in the Ohafia war dance. The war dance music is distinctly masculine. Ohafia people often make this point by observing that its driving rhythm differs markedly from the lilting meter of the music performed by women. Never pausing, the war dance pushes ahead, creating a sense of aggression. Rigid comportment is combined with swift movements. While moving laterally the dancers roll their shoulders in tight circles causing their chest muscles to flex rapidly. Gradu- ally, as the tempo of the music increases, the pectoral flexing accelerates. Finally this process of intensification arrives at a point where the men's chests begin to pulsate with rippling undulations. The phenomenon, called Qf.ufu, constitutes a somatic expression of the ancestral force that empowered the warriors of old and that contin- ues to provide strength and perseverance to young Ohafia men. After our meeting with Nne Uko, Ibe commented,</page><page sequence="4">130 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST * VOL. 98, NO. 1 ? MARCH 1996 "Women are allowed to dance iri agha [the war dance] but they have their style. Nne Uko, being what she is, used to dance as [a] man... performing (fi as men do" (Kalu n.d.b). When Nne Uko married, time passed and she did not conceive a child. During the interview she never men- tioned this, but other people's accounts of her life empha- sized her "failure to conceive" (Kalu n.d.a; Ojiono n.d.; Omiko n.d.). In Africa childlessness is nearly always rep- resented as a misfortune, and this rhetoric may mask those occasions when women choose not to have chil- dren. In the West we tend to translate this representation in medical terms, interpreting it as "barrenness" or "infer- tility." In fact, it is often perceived as a condition of ill fate rather than dysfunctional physiology, and appeals to an- cestors and fertility spirits are appropriate treatments. It is impossible to know whether Nne Uko was infertile or whether she intentionally avoided becoming pregnant.12 In any case, childlessness helped her to cultivate and maintain her status as a brave woman. In Ohafia it was not unusual for marriages to dissolve when they did not pro- duce children, and this was the case with Nne Uko's union. However, because she was already known as a dike nwami, she could begin to make her way in the community by means normally reserved for men. In Ohafia, fanring rights were inherited primarily through the maternal descent group and the allocation of farmlands was usually determined by the elder men of the maternal descent group. Nne Uko, as a young woman, would normally have had access only to marginal lands, but her status as a dike nwami entitled her to special consideration. She exhibited great skill at farming, se- cured good land, and began to accumulate wealth. When she was financially able, she traveled to Ibibio country and acquired a wife. In time she took a second wife in this fashion. Seeking wives from families external to Ohafia was necessary in order to avoid a contradiction in the matrilineal system of inheritance in Ohafia Nne Uko's children were members of her matrilineage, and they would inherit the right to farm the land she had fanmed. If she had taken Ohafia wives, her children would have belonged to two different matrilineages, with the impos- sible implication that they were bomn of two different mothers.13 In his brief study of Ohafia customs, Uche discusses the means for restoring lineage continuity by "adoptive" marriage: The [Ohafia] people dislike childlessness since this implies that the family shrine [ududu] will in course of time become neglected. In most serious cases when a family is fast dying out, then the course open to its surviving members is to extend the boundaries of the family by adoption through marriage. [1960:46] By "adoption through marriage" Uche refers to the practice of adopting non-Ohafia women into the maternal descent group by way of their marriage to male-or in cases such as Nne Uko's, female-members of the group. As Nne Uko told me about her wives she laughed and said, "Now you will want to know if I took them to bed!" She maintained she had not.T4 Her wives had children (with assistance from her brother), and with the help of her wives and her children she continued to distinguish her- self as a farmer and to accumulate wealth. It should be noted that the honorific "Nne," which was used by everyone who referred to Uko Uma Awa, literally means "mother." It is a term of respect accorded to women with adult children. The role of Nne Uko's brother, the biological father of her children, appeared to be ambiguous. Throughout the interview he maintained a slightly proprietary attitude toward her and occasionally interrupted to finish her answers to questions. When we got to the subject of Nne Uko's wives and their children, Ibe asked about her relationship to the young man who had built her house. Her brother aggressively interrupted and asserted the he was the father of the builder. Later Nne Uko stated, "Those women I married have their chil- dren. These children are taking very good care of me as their mother and, in fact, as their father." Her brother interrupted at this point (in a transparent attempt to change the subject) to observe that Nne Uko was the first woman to wear canvas shoes while working on her farm, which had, up until then, been worn only by men. In time her successful farming enabled her to take yam titles in the ceremonies that gave recognition to farmers who amassed large stocks of yams and shared their wealth and food with the community. Ultimately her influence extended beyond the realm of farming, and she was able to gain initiation into various men's societies, including the region's most exclusive men's organization, the Ekpe society. Only elite men (those who pass the social litmus test and can pay the high cost of the cere- mony) are taught the meaning of the secret language of gesture and the hieroglyphs that cover the cloth wrappers worn by initiates, and members are sworn not to reveal the secrets to their wives. Ajike Kalu Uma commented, "It is very rare for women to be initiated into Ekpe society, except the Calabar people." Talbot (1912:44) noted that elderly women (presumably postmenopause) were some- times initiated into the lower ranks of Calabar Ekpe socie- ties. Ekpe elders in Akanu could recall only one other instance of a female initiate in Ohafia: a woman from the village of Asaga who, like Nne Uko, was known as a dike nwami.15 On her membership in Ekpe, Nne Uko com- mented, During my youthful period, the Ekpe society danced in obu Ndi Odo, which was very close to my residence. Then, consid- ering my activities, my inclination to challenge men at the things they did, I was called up to be initiated into the Ekpe society. It was due to my activities and brave actions.... Lots</page><page sequence="5">A BRAVE WOMAN / JOHN C. MCCALL 131 of those societies that men belong to, I also belonged to them. Many of the activities of men, I took part in them. Her brother then added: In those days, as a strong woman, if a man offered a case of gin, she would offer a case of gin. If a man offered a goat, she would offer a goat. Showing that what men could do, she could do. She also had to initiate on behalf of other people. Even those that were from her father's side. Ajike then noted that, in addition to her role in men's societies, Nne Uko had been a leader of women when they mobilized to protest the actions of the men of the commu- nity. "She is one of those who lead such missions. These are some of the things that lead us to call her a brave woman." Asked to comment, Nne Uko explained, At times, when the men put restrictions on women, made decisions which were against us, we, the women, would refuse adhering to the decision and we refused to go to anywhere [to work on the farms and in the market]. We would stay at home and sort it out with the men. I asked if she could recollect a specific instance of such a "women's strike." Yes, there was an instance when there was a quarrel between men and women and things which were not supposed to be said about women were said. The women were so offended that all the women in the village left and traveled to Ebem [a neighboring village]. The men knew that they could not re- main in Akanu without their wives. They had to go down and appeal to the women to come back. Which at last they did.... When such an exodus takes place then the men must send a representative to the clan head of the village where the women have gone and appeal to him with a bottle of wine, a goat, and other things. They must ask the chiefto appeal to their women to join them and go back to their village.... I was involved in that women's exodus to Ebem. I asked Nne Uko when this had occurred. She chuckled and said that "a child of those days has become a grand- mother by now." In the course of Nne Uko's life, she established her- self in the community, not only by proving herself as a leader among women but also by utilizing means that were usually accessible only to men. Now, in her old age, the trappings of manly achievement hung on her walls as memorials to her exceptional life. She no longer partici- pated in Ekpe activities or other masculine pursuits. In- stead she adopted the lifestyle associated with prominent elder females. The children of her wives referred to her as "grandmother." She was taken care of by her children and had risen to a position as priestess of her matrilineage's ududu shrine, offering sacrifice to the ancestresses in her maternal line. The ududu shrine consists of pots kept on the hearth of the matriarch of the matemal descent group. Each pot represents an ancestress and each is given yam and palm wine by the priestess during various agricultural rites. These pots serve as markers of the genealogy of the maternal group. The priestess knows each by name and she is consulted when disputes arise regarding descent group history and land rights. As priestess of the ududu shrine Nne Uko is regarded as the current matriarch of her matrilineage. When she dies, she will have an ududu pot raised to her by her successor. She will be honored, receiving sacrifices from her maternal descent group. Those who claim descent from Nne Uko will farm the lands she once farmed, lands significantly expanded in her celebrated career. This account of a woman who, in spite of childless- ness, managed to position herself as a future ancestress in her matrilineage raises a number of questions about the relationship of human agency to the constitution of social roles. When I originally heard about Nne Uko I imagined she had "become a man." After hearing her own story it became clear she never abandoned womanhood. Rather, she was known as a particular kind of woman: a dike nwami. Throughout her life Nne Uko was recognized in her community as a woman, socially and otherwise. Ulti- mately she attained a privileged office of female authority. Nne Uko's claim, however, that she was "supposed to be a man" introduced an additional concept of gendered personhood that, while independent of apparent physi- ological characteristics, was represented in her narrative as a disposition present and expressed long before gender recodifying might have been necessitated by social con- cerns arising from her childlessness. Determinism or Destiny? Nne Uko established herself as a dike nwami before she was married. Her unique disposition for "manly" achievements was socially recognized before anyone con- ceived of her as a "barren" woman. This fact is at the heart of Nne Uko's explanation of her life-her conviction that she "was supposed to be a man." On the surface Nne Uko would seem to be what O'Brien (1977:113) called an "autonomous female husband": a barren woman who was able to maintain her social status by taking wives and claiming their children as her descendants. But for such a categorization to serve explanatory ends, we would have had to place the social identification of Nne Uko as "bar- ren" causally antecedent to the social objectification of her identity as a dike nwami. Nne Uko's own narrative countermanded any such attempt. The event of the hunt, when she fully embodied the archetype of the dike nwami and was proclaimed by her community as such, was an actualizing moment when her identity became socially objectified. This was not just Nne Uko's conviction but was shared by other people with whom I discussed her life.</page><page sequence="6">132 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST * VOL. 98, NO. 1 . MARCH 1996 I tried to get Nne Uko to go into more detail about what she meant when she said she was supposed to have been a man. I wanted to find out if it concurred with notions I had previously encountered in other interviews pertaining to reincarnation or prenatal agreements. While she readily asserted that she believed in reincarnation, she did not identify with particular ancestors. Nor did she elaborate her case in relation to a specific cosmological model. She preferred to leave it on the level of the mani- festly apparent: her proclivity to move in the masculine domain was evidence of a prenatal disposition that di- verged from her biological endowments. Nne Uko's conviction that her own unique achieve- ments were the result of a cosmological disjuncture is consistent with Jackson's observation that "a 'belief in external independent agencies or powers seems often to be a necessary precondition for people to assume respon- sibility for their own situations and destinies" (1989:60). However, the notion of destiny, as understood in Igbo cosmology, must be distinguished from the notion of structural determinism as understood in the social sci- ences. If one accepts Durkheim's position that gods are merely personifications of social forces, then the two notions do, at first appearance, bear a family resemblance. In Igbo cosmology each person has a shadow guardian known as chi which accompanies him or her through life. Prior to birth, individuals negotiate their life path with their chi and, in some views, with the great Chi (Chi- ukwu) or God. Other interested parties, such as ances- tors, also get involved, and reincarnated spirits may have agendas of their own, drawing upon prior life experiences. In some cases troublesome spirit entities also get mixed up in the proceedings. Some people arrange to be rich, others poor, some to live to an old age, others to succumb early. There is little to be gained by trying to find a logic in these otherworld conferences. More important is that in the Igbo view, destiny is neither entirely chosen nor com- pletely given. It is negotiated. Uchendu has written that for the Igbo, "The world is a marketplace and it is subject to bargain." He goes on to add that "this description of life in the idiom of market exchange is not a mere theoretical formulation of mine; it is the Igbo way and is manifested in their everyday behavior" (1965:15). Ultimately Igbo cosmology is not deterministic at all. One's destiny is negotiated in a crowded, primordial conference; but even then it is merely a contract, subject to betrayal. Misfortune may be interpreted as either the unfolding course of des- tiny or the result of having strayed from one's destiny. Choice emerges at each turn and people are always able "to act otherwise" (Giddens 1986:14). When Nne Uko addressed her ancestors she told them, It was you who prepared me to act. I am not acting on my own power. It is by the power you have given me that I act. My father and mother raised me to live as they lived. [Awa n.d.a] In saying this she is not disavowing the ability to act on her own but rather affirming the Igbo assumption that good life comes only when one follows the ways of one's ancestors: "to live as they lived." This is the rhetoric of ritual oration, a negotiation aimed at acquiring the re- quested blessings. In the Igbo view, social constraints constitute a dominant aspect of the ground upon which one's life is played out, but they cannot determine its outcome. The social grounds of Nne Uko's situation were clearly a forceful factor in her unusual life. She was a member of a matrilineage that owned much land and needed heirs to secure its holdings. The fact that she had no children constituted a dilemma for her descent group, a blockage in the system of property distribution, and a disjuncture in social continuity. But this fact was not enough to explain her particular life project. Nne Uko revealed that as her life unfolded she experienced a grow- ing sense of her manly character and preordained destiny as divergent from that of most women. The event of the ritual hunt, the extraordinary divine intervention, and Nne Uko's bold performance were crucial in gaining public recognition and acceptance of her personal sense of her- self. Hence, when she did not become pregnant, she was not treated like other barren women, who were compelled to make sacrifices to ancestors and fertility shrines to remedy their condition. She had already sought another path for herself, that of the dike nwami. Female Husbands "Female husbands" are well documented in the an- thropological literature on Africa Early in the century Meek (1925:209) referred to the practice as "a curious and ancient custom" among the Yoruba, Nupe, and other groups in northern Nigeria. Other early reports included those from Thomas (1914:59) and later Talbot (1932:195- 196) on the Igbo in southeastern Nigeria, the Seligmans (1932:164-165) on the Dinka and Nuer in the Sudan, Stayt (1931) on the Venda in the Transvaal, and Herskovits (1937) on Dahomey. These accounts treated woman-to- woman marriage as an ethnological curiosity that high- lighted particular features of kin-based social and eco- nomic organization. Later studies by Evans-Pritchard (1951:107-109) on the Nuer and Gluckman (1950:184) on the Zulu provided additional data but few new insights. With the fluorescence of anthropological theory in the 1960s (Ortner 1984), the topic was revitalized and woman- to-woman marriage became a reference point in the con- troversy regarding the relationship between gender and power in Africa.</page><page sequence="7">A BRAVE WOMAN / JOHN C. MCCALL 133 O'Brien (1977:112-113) identified two categories of female husband. In the first were women who acted as surrogates for their deceased fathers or nonexistent brothers in order to provide heirs for their agnatic lineage. In the second category were "autonomous female hus- bands": women who married independently to improve their social standing and sometimes to have children when they themselves were infertile or postmenopausal. While general agreement existed regarding the circum- stances conducive to woman-to-woman marriages, there was considerable disagreement as to the gender status of female husbands. The crux of the debate was identified succinctly by Oboler (1980), who asked, "Is the female husband a man?" Were female husbands socially reclassi- fied as males-a fudging of gender categories for struc- tural purposes-or were they evidence of a broader base of female social potential in these societies? O'Brien observed that among the Southern Bantu "females who assume positions of power are expected to become social males" (1977:120-121). In support of this contention she observed that female leaders were prohib- ited from marrying men. Riviere (1971:68) argued that women who marry other women were always conceptu- alized as male and thus for analytical purposes such mar- riages need not be considered distinct from male-female unions. Data from other regions, however, suggested that such broad generalizations could not be made. Huber (1969:746) observed that among the Simbete, women who marry in this manner are not considered men or even husbands but are referred to by the women they marry as "mother-in-law." A stronger criticism came from Krige (1974:32-33), who argued that while in some societies a transposition of gender may accompany woman-to- woman marriage, in others such as the Lovedu, where women exercise considerable political and jural author- ity, the right to marry women is as much a feminine as a masculine prerogative. The critique of the notion that powerful women must be classified as social males was most clearly formulated by Obbo (1976:371), who noted that ideologies of male dominance in Africa were too often mistaken for a social reality. The bias toward male informants and male idioms of social exegesis led ethnographers to depict woman-to- woman marriage as an anomaly that was tolerated be- cause it resolved certain structural discontinuities. In con- trast to this view she provided case studies illustrating that woman-to-woman marriage was one of several strate- gies women employed to overcome the limitations im- posed by dominant male ideology. Obbo (1976:385) made the observation that "while African women seek and util- ize the options available more on an individual basis to secure maximum personal benefit, Western women by contrast seem more determined to liberate womankind . .. through collective organization." I question Obbo's essentialized "Western" and "Afri- can" strategies. Certainly many examples can be cited of collective mobilization against male authority by African women, on the one hand, and of the employment of indi- vidual strategies against male dominance by women in the West, on the other.'6 Obbo's observation does, however, expose a theoretical bias which characterizes both sides of the debate. By focusing on the implications woman-to- woman marriage has for models of social organization and our understanding of "women's roles" in particular socie- ties, little attention has been given to how individual female husbands create, conceptualize, and explain their own lives. Just as researchers tend to naturalize ideologies of male dominance, they also naturalize Western ideologies of dominance by assuming the primacy of formal analyti- cal models in interpreting non-Western cultures. The nar- ratives of our informants and the personal and cultural exegesis emerging from those narratives are generally treated as "data" rather than as forms of reflexive theori- zation in their own right. As we increasingly acknowledge that ethnography is a socially and historically embedded process, the categorization of academic discourse as ob- jective theory and indigenous discourse as subjective data becomes suspect.'7 1 propose that powerful interpretive frameworks may be found in the perspectives of the peo- ple we study. While social theorists emphasize the pri- macy of the social over the individual and of structure over agency, our informants tend to explore the play of structure, contingency, and the character of individuals in interaction. Their narratives embrace the complex and irreducible whole that constitutes lived social praxis. Revolution or Restoration? While women in Ohafia, like Igbo women in general, have considerable social mobility and economic auton- omy, they are, nevertheless, subject to culturally defined divisions of labor, space, and activities on the basis of sex. But against the daily formality of gender there are ritual- ized moments during which women are allowed, even encouraged, to engage and compete in those endeavors normally used by men to establish the strength and cour- age that constitute masculinity. One example of this is the .Uzo Iyi ceremony, which takes place every other year in the village of Elu. Young maidens hoping for fertility in their marriages and older women suffering from barren- ness make sacrifices to Ishia, a fertility shrine associated with a local spring. During the ceremonies the girls repli- cate the proud posturing of boys, engaging in wrestling matches and shouting insults at everyone-particularly older men-who comes near the makeshift tower they erect in the village square.</page><page sequence="8">134 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST . VOL. 98, NO. 1 . MARCH 1996 in her maternal descent group. The "normal tightness" of the social order which Gluckman saw affirmed by Zulu rites of reversal was, in Nne Uko's case, not merely rein- forced but reconstituted. The reversal of fate, which Rigby saw as the motivation of the Ugogo rites of reversal, was not merely the objective of an irrational ritual of sympa- thetic magic, but ultimately resulted in a reversal of fate in actuality: Nne Uko's "barrenness" was overcome by social rather than biological means, and she became a grandmother. The inseparability of social structure and human agency becomes clearly manifest in Nne Uko's life. This is an important realization for social theorists, but perhaps, more vitally, it is a basic tenet of the Ohafia worldview. The Ohafia would concur with Sartre (1969:45) that "in the end one is always responsible for what is made of one." Regardless of how often individual Ohafia people may give credit to God, ancestors, and other "external agents" for their successes and failures, in the end, as every burial ceremony makes clear, each person ultimately takes the credit or blame for whatever he or she has or has not accomplished during life. When death takes Nne Uko, the ceremony will celebrate her accomplishments, her chil- dren's age sets will perform, and the men of the Ekpe society will dance in her honor. Her successes will be acknowledged in grand style. When she is lowered into the grave, however, a small incision will be made in her womb so that "it will be open" in her next incarnation. Nne Uko became a heroine because she prevailed in her life. As an ancestress honored in the ududu shrine she will be remembered for generations, her name invoked and her blessings sought by those seeking the success of crops and the birth of children. She obtained this honor not by pretending to be something she was not but by daring to be what she truly was: a dike nwami, a brave woman indeed. Notes Acknowledgments. I am indebted to Uko Uma Awa, whose life provides the focus for this analysis, and to Ibe Nwosu Kalu, Ajike Kalu Ume, Ifeoma Kalu, Kalu Omiko, and Udo Ojiono for their assistance and insights. Azuka Dike, Paula Girshick, Michael Jackson, Michael Herzfeld, and Ruth Stone read early versions of the paper and provided constructive criticism. Recognition also goes to Paul Stoller, Alma Gottlieb, and a third anonymous reader who reviewed the manuscript for this journal and offered excellent suggestions for revision. I especially want to express my appreciation to Stoller for encouraging me to employ "the power of form to subvert." The field research referred to in this article was conducted between 1989 and 1991 and was funded by a Fulbright-Hays Fellowship, a Sigma Xi Grant-in-Aid of Research, and a David Skomp Fellowship. Parts of this article appear in chapter 4 of my dissertation, "The Ohafia War Dance as Lived Experience: History and Identity in a Nigerian Commu- nity" (1992). Rituals of reversal such as this occur in many cultures and have received much attention from anthropologists. In Max Gluckman's classic analysis of Zulu ceremony, he argues that such inversions of relations perform a kind of functional catharsis. In order to supplicate an earth god- dess and gain good harvests, young Zulu girls dress as men and, fully armed, take cattle to pasture as men normally would. Later in the ceremonies, women and girls go with- out clothes, singing lewd songs and shouting insults at the men they meet. Gluckman concludes that this ritualized "domination" of men by women provides them a tempo- rary cathartic release from their subservience while rein- forcing a sense of the "normal rightness" of the social order that constrains women at other times (Gluckman 1965:116). Peter Rigby (1968:153) suggests that Gluckman exaggerates the rebelliousness of Zulu rituals. Rigby's analysis provides a detailed examination of how ritual inversions are structurally related to ritual objectives. He argues that manipulation of gender roles, as in the case of armed women who display "warlike behavior," is consid- ered by the Ugogo to act as a force capable of effecting sympathetic reversals in misfortunes such as barrenness or crop failure (Rigby 1968:172-173). Judith Hanna (1977:122) has proposed that both Gluckman and Rigby rely too much on the assumption of the "normal rightness" of male dominance. She observes that Ugogo women seize control of ritual processes at exactly the point at which male ritual specialists appear to have failed: Perhaps these representations of conflict through role rever- sal and behavioral inversions are posited as a latent system of potential alternatives if contingency so warrants: a role rever- sal in fact, revolution or anarchy. [Hanna 1977:123] It is this "latent system of potential alternatives," which offers the possibility of "a role reversal in fact," that seems most relevant to Nne Uko's circumstance. Nne Uko's role reversal, which was publicly enacted in the context of a ceremonial hunt, became a role reversal in fact. Her rec- ognition as a dike nwami overflowed the specific bounds of ritual and came to define her social status in life. This, however, did not result in revolutionary change on a social level. Rather, it was an example of the remarkable ability of individuals to manipulate the social order and to achieve a kind of social objectification of their own expe- rience by cultural means. Unlike the routinized ritual inversions referred to by Gluckman and Rigby, Nne Uko's case seems to be the product of a coincidence of serendipitous events and the will of an exceptional individual. For Nne Uko, to become recognized as a dike nwami was not only to become recognized as a man (albeit in a woman's body), but also to become a fully realized woman by means other than biological motherhood. In this manner she was ultimately able to claim and fulfill her role as a senior elder woman</page><page sequence="9">A BRAVE WOMAN / JOHN C. MCCALL 135 1. Ohafia consists of 25 villages covering a region of about 100 square miles located to the west of the Cross River in Abia State, Nigeria. Ohafia language is a dialect of Igbo. 2. Ohafia kinship is characterized by double-unilineal de- scent Agricultural land is primarily held by matrilineal descent groups while residential property is held by patrilineal descent groups (McCall 1995; Nsugbe 1974). This land tenure system and the associated kinship and marriage practices are shared by their neighbors (Nkporo Ada, Abiriba, Abam, Ihe). Forde and Jones (1950:10) classified this culturally distinct group of Igbo speaking peoples as the Cross River I[g]bo. The system is also quite similar to that of the Afiqpo as described by Ottenberg (1968). 3. The Aro people, whose capital was in Aro Chukwu, con- trolled the slave trade and exercised a loose political dominance over the region until they were forcibly suppressed by British colonial troops in the first year of this century (McCall 1992:62- 66). 4. The long basket was traditionally used by women to carry produce but when bearing heads it would resemble the head- dress worn by the leader of a war dance troupe. 5. No one, including Nne Uko, knew her exact age. My esti- mate is based on information about her age set and the fact that she indicated she was a young woman when the Igbo "Women's War" occurred in 1929. 6. Yams are a "men's" crop and yam titles are usually held only by men even if the labor that contributed to the production of the yams was provided primarily by their wives or mothers. 7. Awa n.d.a. Libation oration situates events in social and historical space. The orator calls the names of male ancestors in the paternal line associated with the host compound entreating them to come and join in the drinking. Skill at libation oration is judged by one's knowledge of ancestral names and a facility with proverbs. Nne Uko's oration was excellent in this regard. 8. Quotes from Nne Uko are not presented verbatim. Her statements are translated from Ohasfa dialect and have been slightly reordered to promote clarity. All quotes of Nne Uko and other interview participants are from Awa (n.d.b) except where other sources are indicated. 9. When girls reached puberty they were secluded in "fatten- ing houses." They ate rich foods and were exempted from farm labor so they could become voluptuous in preparation for mar- riage and childbearing. This custom has not been practiced in Ohafia since the 1950s. 10. This "pygmy" antelope or duiker (Cephalopus mergens) is known as mgbada in other Igbo areas. 11. Kamalu is an aru. nsi, a word for which the English term "spirit" is a poor translation. A more adequate defmition, how- ever, exceeds the limits of this paper. The appearance of arunsi in dreams is common in Ohafia. In one instance, I asked a shrine priest who had had such a visitation about the form of the entity. The priest said it is very difficult to describe, that it is not anthropomorphic but like the presence of "a kind of darkness." 12. While sexual abstinence and prolonged nursing were the most common forms of birth control in Ohafia at that time, abortifacients were available from herbalists. 13. This type of "bride purchase" is distinct from conven- tional bride negotiations in several ways. The bride wealth required is much greater, and on contractual and practical levels it resembles the buying of a slave more than it does the wedding of a wife. However, if a woman thus acquired is ever referred to as a slave, she can charge the offender with having gravely insulted her and will be entitled, by customary law, to recom- pense. 14. O'Brien notes that nowhere do the Africa data suggest any homosexual conno- tations in [woman-to-woman] marriages. Rather, the wife of a female husband chooses or is assigned one or more males who become her sexual partners and the biological fathers of her children. [1977:109] 15. An Ekpe chief confided to me that Nne Uko was allowed to initiate specifically because she was barren. He noted that she never passed beyond the lower ranks. Despite the fact that her membership may have been limited, I was assured by the chief that when she died, the Ekpe masquerade (Okonko) would perform at her burial as it does for all members. 16.
