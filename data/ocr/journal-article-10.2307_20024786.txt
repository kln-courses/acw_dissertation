<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRAWFORD YOUNG Patterns of Social Conflict: State, Class, and Ethnicity In the somber mood evoked by reflections on the prospects for mankind worldwide in this decade, it is difficult to recapture the sense of exhilaration that attended African liberation at its high-water mark in 1960, when no fewer than sixteen states achieved independence. The crumbling of colonialism seemed but prologue to other triumphs. A young and vigorous leadership would capture the resources once diverted by the colonizers, and direct them into the swift construction of prosperous national economies. The sense of common purpose that nationalism had frequently crystallized would be translatable into the sphere of economic development. In this springtime of hope, the harvest of plenty was within reach. Probably no other geographic region experienced such a conjuncture of optimism and newly won sovereignty. Confusion and disorder had attended the birth of new states in Latin America. Independence in Asia was punctuated with such upheavals as the partition of India and the bitter colonial wars in Indonesia and Indochina. Progress appeared at the time a veritable birthright of humanity, as a prolonged era of economic expansion in most parts of the world fostered the conviction among many that the policy instruments and political wisdom for its indefinite continuation were at hand.1 In the two decades that followed, the sanguine expectations of 1960 were shattered by a number of savage blows. In Africa, it became clear that, for many states, the blessings of abundance were remote. In many countries, the rural economy stagnated, which in turn accelerated the flight of the young from the countryside. Growing numbers of formerly self-sufficient countries re quired increasing quantities of food imports to feed burgeoning urban popula tions. Non-oil-producing states faced a devastating rise in energy costs, payable in scarce hard currency. Returns from the classical export commodities? cotton, coffee, cocoa, vegetable oils?could not keep pace, leading to a rising external indebtedness. Inter-African armed conflicts were on the increase?the Horn, the Uganda invasion, Chad, the Western Sahara?and carried with them the risk of higher degrees of external involvement. The extraordinary and lasting damage that could be inflicted upon a society by destructive and predatory regimes became clear, as in Uganda, Equatorial Guinea, the Central African Republic, and Ghana. The continuing liberation struggle in Southern Africa imposed heavy sacrifices on neighboring states. All of these trends portend higher orders of potential social conflict in the years ahead. 71</page><page sequence="2">72 CRAWFORD YOUNG Recent history suggests that the major patterns of social conflict cohere around two organizing principles: class and ethnicity. Both are shaped and defined in important ways by the state, which serves as the primary arena for social encounter and collective conflict. Thus an inquest into contemporary and prospective social conflict requires an examination of the spheres of state, class, and ethnicity. All three are in flux, all three are changing, and the task before us is to seek out the elements of transformation within each. Most critical of all is the nexus that joins them. Although each has a certain autonomy, at least analytically, the essence of political and social dynamics can be found in the interaction between them. The contemporary state was shaped in profound ways by its colonial past, as were its current patterns of class and ethnic relationships. In contrast, the continuities in the character of state, class, or ethnicity with the precolonial world are far more tenuous, for during the colonial era, older forms of stratification and cultural identity were eroded and new state structures superposed on previous political forms. An analysis of the contemporary African state thus needs to begin with a consideration of the colonial state and the class and ethnic realms shaped by it. Political independence brought important changes in the character of the state, as well as major transformations in the nature of class and cultural pluralism; this is most conveniently examined as a separate historical moment. I will begin with a discussion of the colonial period, and then proceed to an analysis of the contemporary epoch. First, however, it is important to define the concepts of state, class, and ethnicity as used herein. State7 Class, and Ethnicity One of the most curious paradoxes in recent intellectual history was the simultaneous vast increase in the scope and impact of the state and its virtual eclipse as an issue in all major theoretical paradigms in the postwar era. Only in the last few years has a revived consciousness of the state's centrality as an autonomous component of society become apparent. This renewed concern with the state as a conceptual problematic can be seen in the Fall 1979 issue of Daedalus that was devoted to this topic, and in the designation of "state" as the theme for the 1981 annual meetings of the American Political Science Association.2 It is useful to understand the state as existing on two levels: concrete and theoretical. The first, the matrix of institutions through which rule is exercised, poses no great difficulties. For most readers, the term "state" will initially evoke the classical three branches of governance: executive, legislative, and judicial. When to these are added such other familiar instrumentalities as political parties, regulatory bodies, parastatal corporations (public enterprises), social agencies (schools, medical facilities), regional administration, and local govern mental bodies, the state as the organized public sector of society begins to take shape. Less immediately apparent, but even more crucial to my discussion, is the state as a theoretical abstraction, that is, the state as expressed in the realm of ideology. Every living state reflects a public doctrine of rule and authority. In</page><page sequence="3">PATTERNS OF SOCIAL CONFLICT: STATE, CLASS, AND ETHNICITY 73 one sense, the state ideology finds formal expression in constitutions and jurisprudence, through which its structures are specified and its commands congealed into a code of prescriptions. Underlying these manifestations of public doctrine are the philosophical assumptions upon which the supremacy of the state rests and according to which its legitimacy is asserted. The normative doctrine of the modern state includes such postulates as sovereignty (supremacy with respect to society, autonomy in relation to other states), territoriality, and nationality. This well-nigh universal public doctrine of the nation-state is distinctively modern; although state forms of political organization can be traced back several millennia, such critical notions as sovereignty, territoriality, and nation received conscious elaboration only in comparatively recent times.3 . Although the state in important respects is autonomous from society, and exercises rule over it, the state also reflects and embodies class structure and ethnic (or religious) configurations. Its public doctrine tends to incorporate the values that prevail among dominant social strata, and its agents are likely to be disproportionately recruited from these groups.4 In its self-definition as nation, the state projects an identity that often incorporates the cultural symbols of its most numerous or dominant ethnolinguistic or religious communities: contem porary Iran, for example, is self-consciously a Persian and Islamic state. Class, even more than the state, is the subject of a vast and rich literature; I cannot begin to cover all aspects of the stratification and class question in this essay, but only to make clear its usage therein.5 Much of the theoretical debate concerning class in Africa arises from the lack of congruence between the social formations observable in African states and the categories that have gained currency in class analysis.6 A definitive resolution is not yet in sight. For purposes of this discussion, then, class is viewed as a social aggregate within the polity, defined by its common role, function, and status within the socioeconomic setting?that is, a societal unit primarily bounded by the nation state, though influenced by the external arena. Unlike ethnicity, class categories are analytical constructs in the first instance, though they may acquire social meaning and become powerful foci of solidarity. Like ethnicity, class is, both objectively and subjectively, a relational concept. Precisely because class categories are analytical formulations, they tend to reflect in part terminology that is already widely current: worker and bourgeoi sie, peasant and middle class. Yet, specific features in the development of systematic patterns of inequality in Africa work against the replication of these class forms. Further, folk perceptions of inequality yield categories of under standing of social hierarchies that offers important insights into the way stratification penetrates the social consciousness.7 Thus social class in Africa can be most usefully delineated by examining the impact of classical lexicon, emerging patterns of vertical differentiation, and popular conceptualizations.8 Class as a basis for ordering the social universe is intersected by cultural pluralism, understood as multiple units of social affinity within a territorial society, based upon commonalities of language, ethnicity, religion, or region. To grasp this phenomenon, it is necessary to set aside the lapidary simplicity of the ethnic map, with its connotations of stability and discrete, bounded entities. Cultural pluralism in Africa is an exceedingly complex amalgam of multilayered and interpenetrating identities, themselves in the process of evolution. In</page><page sequence="4">74 CRAWFORD YOUNG essence, it is a self-versus-other relationship, where particular categories are defined according to characteristics that differentiate them from relevant others. For any individual, the "other" is a set of collective representations that are perceived as having some objective existence. The "we," however, is an intensely subjective category, and is likely to be accompanied by powerful affective attachments. The groups are not defined by innate, permanent cultural characteristics; the set of customs associated with a particular group may change appreciably over time, while the identity of the group persists.9 Ethnicity is not simply a mirror image of class, a horizontal set of cleavages that symmetrically contrast with the vertical hierarchies of class. Class divisions can be important to society without the crystallization of pronounced solidari ties within the strata. Consciousness, however, is what at bottom defines ethnos. Common cultural traits and linguistic similarity provide the potential for subjective affinity, but the ethnic group only becomes an actuality when its members grasp the meaning of "we-ness." Further, ethnic consciousness has emotional dimensions not usually found in class solidarities, even where these are well rooted. The very vocabulary in which ethnicity is articulated is suffused with the intimacy of kinship referents. "We" are fictive brothers and sisters, while ethnic myths frequently postulate an eponymous common ancestor, thereby creating an ideology of genealogical commonality. Religious affinity frequently travels a similar course. These, then, are the understandings of state, class, and ethnicity employed herein. They will be examined first in the colonial, and then in the postcolonial setting. The Colonial State The state as a form of human organization is of course very old in Africa, going back at least five thousand years. Indeed, like the human species itself, states may well have originated in Africa. The system of states that concerns us, however, the fifty-four contemporary sovereign units, originates in the imperial partition of Africa in the late nineteenth century. The amalgam of factors that propelled the partition?simple imperial aggrandizement, European rivalries, aggressive imperial agents, the expansion of religious missions, the scent of precious minerals, the quest for markets?led within a short time to the imposition of a largely novel pattern of territorial demarcations. Some precolo nial states, such as Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Rwanda, Burundi, Swaziland, and Lesotho, preserved their identity in partition. But the network of colonial territories was fundamentally new, both in the units created and in the international state system into which Africa now became incorporated.10 The colonial state system carried a concept of territoriality with important implications. In striking contrast to the precolonial African state system, boundaries acquired great significance; as the colonial states became organized, all persons were compelled to acquire a territorial classification. Further, the Berlin Conference of 1884-85?a pivotal diplomatic event in the partition process?introduced the new principle of "effective occupation" as indispens able to legitimation of imperial territorial claims. The colonial state thus had to establish a military presence quickly, particularly on its frontiers, if it were not</page><page sequence="5">PATTERNS OF SOCIAL CONFLICT: STATE, CLASS, AND ETHNICITY 75 to risk seizure by a European rival. Over time, the boundaries that demarcated the colonial domains of different European powers acquired considerable social and economic significance. Movement of peoples across these boundaries? while it continued?was now an international affair. Different monetary systems were established, and trade across borders was subject to regulation and taxation. The communication systems created by the colonial powers were oriented toward the new territorial concepts, and externally directed toward the metropolis. In myriad symbolic ways, the distinctiveness of colonial territorial zones was embodied in the rituals and artifacts of everyday life: flags, coins, uniforms, postage stamps, administrative languages. In the baggage trains of imperialism traveled quite novel concepts of the state, derived from the public ideologies of nineteenth century Europe. The precolonial state, the stateless zones of jurai community, rested on shared customary values and often elaborate traditional constitutionalism. The new state was an abstraction, equipped with comprehensive innate rights attached to the new impersonal doctrine of sovereignty. Its existence and legitimacy were validated by its recognition within the European system of international jurisprudence. In this perspective, Africa, with a few exceptions such as Morocco, Egypt, or Ethiopia, was a sovereign void, permitting the new states to claim plenary powers of occupation and exploitation of the continent's land, minerals, and human labor. Certain crucial aspects of European state theory, however, were not transferred. State-limiting doctrines that had grown in tandem with the jurai philosophy of the state?constitutionalism, civil liberties, liberalism?were carefully left behind. So also was the idea of the nation as sacred corollary of the state, a notion that had acquired explosive force in Europe. Colonial states, in truth, were the antithesis of national states; they were alien entities, instrumentalities whose raison d'?tre was domination. Their institutional forms were marked by the imperative of hegemony over subject populations: the essentially military character of the early colonial state, the network of district strongholds through which overrule was extended through the territorial domain, the uniforms that state agents frequently wore. The colonial state sought to equip itself with a mythology of irresistible power and force?in the Belgian case, the state was colloquially known as Bula Matari (crusher of rocks)11?in order to impose its hegemony and simultaneously find means to extract from peasant economies the fiscal resources to pay for conquest and for its own institutionalization.12 The newly imposed boundaries created by the grid of colonial states for the most part ignored cultural patterns in the subjugated societies, to which, with a few exceptions, little importance was attached. The vagaries of European diplomacy and military campaigns, possibly influenced by alliances with local African political forces, determined the boundary outcomes. A particular precolonial African state might, by treaty or alliance, or by calculation (or miscalculation) of advantage, assign itself to a given colonial domain. However, almost no one on the European side cared whether a particular language group was united or divided by colonial partition. Indeed, only with the rise of the concept of the national state in Europe had such issues acquired political significance anywhere; language and culture were not weighty concerns in boundary maneuvering for the premodern dynastic states of Europe. In Africa</page><page sequence="6">76 CRAWFORD YOUNG as well, state and ethnicity were usually quite separate principles of affiliation. As Elizabeth Colson has pointed out, "Political and ethnic boundaries rarely coincided in pre-colonial Africa."13 Over time, the colonial state required an additional gloss for its public ideology to consolidate its claims of internal and external legitimacy. This was found in such concepts as "trusteeship," "mise en valeur," and the "civilizing mission." Hegemony was a paternal obligation of the administering power, to bring the blessings of "good government," as understood by the colonizer, to subjugated populations. With political and legal protection for metropolitan capital, in the form of property rights and contract enforcement, and with the frequently coercive mobilization of indigenous labor, natural resources could be developed for what was asserted to be the common benefit of mankind. Spiritual uplift would be made available through Christian evangelization, and Western culture would be dispensed through a colonial education system. For a long time, the colonial state was not nearly as able to impose its will fully and to implement its designs as it claimed. Until the 1920s, a number of areas were not really under administrative control. A basic framework of state organization was in place, however, and this carried the potential for consider able expansion. Transformations in the international arena?particularly the changes wrought by World War II?and the emergent challenge of nationalism imposed the formulation of additional ideological defenses for the colonial state, which in turn impelled its remarkably swift expansion in the postwar era. The notions of "development" and "welfare" were added to the public doctrine of the state, and given concrete embodiment in a ramifying state infrastructure to provide these services. In the Belgian Congo, state expenditures multiplied fifteenfold between 1939 and 1950, then tripled again in the 1950s.14 In Ghana, public expenditures in 1946-47 were a mere ?6,630,000, having only doubled over the preceding thirty-five years; in the following decade, they multiplied tenfold.15 The Colonial State, Class, and Ethnicity The colonial state radically altered existing patterns of social stratification and ethnicity. In only a few places in precolonial Africa was socioeconomic differentiation rooted in large differences of wealth and command of resources (Egypt, Maghreb, Ethiopia), though there were often important status differen tials between noble, commoner, and client or slave.16 Wholly new principles and determinants of stratification were injected by the colonial state. At the top of the social hierarchy stood the European category. This foreign estate included colonial officialdom, those associated with colonial mercantile capitalism, missionaries, and?in North, East, and especially Southern Africa? a permanent, settled white populace that seized much of the best land and dominated the economy. In the extreme case of South Africa, the colonial state quickly gave way to a racial hegemony state,17 whose constitutive ideology was the preservation of white supremacy. At the other end of the spectrum, in West Africa, white populations were generally small and dominated by officialdom. Everywhere, the foreign estate that grew up around the colonial state held a commanding position in power, status, and relative wealth (partially excepting, on the latter score, the missionaries).</page><page sequence="7">PATTERNS OF SOCIAL CONFLICT: STATE, CLASS, AND ETHNICITY 77 In its quest for hegemony and revenue, the colonial state in its early stages usually took steps that precluded African access to new means of wealth accumulation: European trading houses were accorded various mercantile monopolies; lucrative export crops were reserved to European planters; and restrictions of legal status and property rights truncated indigenous capitalism. The severity of the blockages ran on a gradient dependent upon the size of the European populace, with Nigeria?where significant room for indigenous enterprise existed?and South Africa?with comprehensive exclusion?consti tuting the poles.18 Yet a new class was beginning to take form in the shadow of the colonial state, Africans who through some degree of Western education had acquired literacy in the European language and thus qualified for white-collar employ ment in one of the new hierarchies of the colonial era: clerks in public or private bureaucracies; teachers; auxiliary medical personnel; priests, preachers, and catechists for the religious institutions brought by the missionaries. At the height of the colonial epoch, they were usually labeled by some status term that connoted their relative proximity to the European world and their distance from the mere "native" subject: assimilado for the Portuguese, ?volu? for the Belgians, perhaps "citizen" for the French. In the 1950s, terminology shifted, and they became known as "elites," a descriptor alluding to their presumptive leading position within African society.19 Subsequently, they have become retrospec tively categorized as a "petty bourgeoisie,"20 to incorporate them within more conventional social class terminology. Within the system of social values introduced by the colonial state, they had considerable status, yet rarely did they enjoy either wealth or power. Also of significance during the colonial period, especially in areas under British rule, were the chiefs, administrative intermediaries who, like capillaries, linked the European-staffed colonial state with the rural subject populace. Particularly under the administrative ideology of "indirect rule," these were usually persons with some customary claim to authority. Only in a relatively few cases did they have much real autonomy (for example, in northern Nigeria and Buganda). Relative to the average villager, they had some power and wealth, certainly enough to ensure a supply of candidates. In comparison to the foreign estate or their counterparts in, say, India, the chiefs cut a sorry figure. As agents of execution of the colonial order and its frequently distasteful commands (taxation, labor recruitment, military conscription, repression of dissidence), their situation was often uncomfortable. They were above all dependent clients of the colonial state. As the latter responded to its own inner imperative of increasing bureaucratic rationality, "competency" by European criteria took its place alongside prescriptive attributes of descent and customary legitimacy in determining appointment.21 The new political order created by the colonial state opened the door for the emergence of a capitalist sector, launched by the foreign estate. Initially, this took the form of mines and plantations (apart from the trading companies, which needed only a small labor force). These were highly labor-intensive operations; the gold mines in northwest Za?re, for example, employed 50,000 workers in their heyday. The state generally believed these developments to be indispensable for its own fiscal viability, and through various devices?taxation and enforced recruitment?took steps to guarantee a labor supply. Also, the</page><page sequence="8">78 CRAWFORD YOUNG crucial infrastructure that the state was obliged to provide, above all in transportation (railways, roads, harbors), was itself a substantial employer. From the 1920s on, light consumer industries producing such goods as textiles and beverages also developed. The workers gradually became a significant social category, though?except in South Africa?not a very numerous one overall. Its collective consciousness during the colonial era remained weaker than its numbers, because in many areas, migrant laborers, who planned only a limited sojourn in the workforce, predominated, retaining their rural affiliations and rights.22 In the rural sector, the colonial state quickly became committed to the promotion of cash export agriculture, usually grafted onto peasant household economies. The most crucial impetus again came from the revenue require ments of the state. The imposition of commercial agriculture created small monetary incomes for peasants, which could then be recaptured in part through the head tax. Also, the bulked and processed commodity could be inexpensively taxed at the point of export?often as much as a third of its value. Finally, these impositions provided metropolitan manufacturers with a source for raw materi als, especially cotton and vegetable oils. A significant portion of the peasant household labor resources were thus diverted to producing peanuts, cotton, palm oil, cocoa, or coffee. In the process, the villager became part of a larger economic and social system,23 and "peasant" as a social category took on new meanings.24 In a few areas, the value of the export crop (in relation to its labor requirements) was sufficiently high to permit a modest number of farmers to become predominantly commercial in their outlook; this was possible especially in cocoa and coffee areas. A significant class of petty rural capitalists took form here, often combining trade and transport with farming as a means of accumulation (Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Uganda, and Tanzania).25 In many areas, a small number of cultivators, through farming skill and effective exploitation of government services, became somewhat more prosperous than the average villager, and were seen as "big men" in the local community. The territorial colonial state also indelibly marked the cultural definitions of the subjugated societies. Ethnic and religious self-consciousness certainly existed in precolonial Africa. The lack of coincidence, however, between these principles of affiliation and political construction, the small scale of most rural societies, and (save within the Islamic sphere) the absence of crystallized ideologies of identity meant that earlier patterns of cultural geography were qualitatively different from contemporary modes of ethnic identities. In this respect, Africa followed a pathway quite similar to that taken elsewhere in the development of what in European studies has usually been termed "nationalism."26 Two phenomena had a profound and crucial impact on the development of ethnic categories. These were, first, the classification and creation of territorial subdivisions by the colonial state, which were indispensable to the institutional ization of its dominance, and second, the unequal opportunities for social mobility among the different cultural groups, which over time created wide spread perceptions of ethnic stratification.</page><page sequence="9">PATTERNS OF SOCIAL CONFLICT: STATE, CLASS, AND ETHNICITY 79 Regarding classification, we should first note the comprehensive social, legal, and economic significance created for racial categories. While phenotypi cal difference was always obvious, "races" as self-conscious collective categories were new. Colonial legal systems invariably accorded a privileged status to Europeans, and possibly to a small number of mulattoes or Africans assimilated to European status; "natives," or subjects, were relegated to a secondary juridical zone. With varying degrees of intensity, the white-black hierarchy became embedded in social practices wherever Africans and Europeans inter acted. From this eventually arose the racial consciousness that was an important motif in the African nationalist response to colonialism and subjugation (Pan Africanism, the n?gritude doctrines of Senghor and others, and the Black Consciousness movement in South Africa).27 For a number of colonial purposes, it sufficed to apply the broad and ultimately racial label of "native." There were, however, a number of circum stances for which a more discriminating typology was important. The institu tionalization of a system of rural administration required the drawing of discrete local boundaries. The designation of local intermediaries presumed knowledge of who held authority over whom, with a frequent presumption that political affiliation and ethnic affinity were identical. Christian missions, with vast evangelical ambitions and limited means, had crucial decisions to make regarding linguistic vehicles for catechism and how best to use their resources. Labor recruiters swiftly acquired mental maps for applying labels and accompa nying stereotypes to various workforce reservoirs. An important part of the energies of the early generation of field administra tors was devoted to this type of identification and sorting process. Although a number of these exhibited great analytical subtlety in the execution of their tasks, they inevitably applied an alien logic to the infinite complexities of the social milieu. The ethnic reality so well captured by Aidan Southall in his epigrammatic observation that cultural affinities were in their essence "inter locking, overlapping, multiple"28 was anathema to administrative rationality, which demanded a physical map with discrete, bounded units. The impulse for classification went furthest in the British case, no doubt informed by the imperial experience in India, where differences of community, religion, or language were discovered to have so many implications for an economical system of alien governance. In the extreme case, primarily encoun tered in the British realm, the colonial state visibly created new categories of identity.29 Ethnonyms in East Africa such as Teso, Gisu, Toro, Acholi, Kiga, Sukuma, or Luhya would hardly have been encountered at all a century ago. Even where the identity units were not themselves novel, major alterations in the scope of ethnonyms were very frequent. A corollary to this process of classification was the crystallization of stereotypical attributes concerning the various groups. Industrious or lazy; valorous or timorous; receptive or antipathetic to the imported culture of the colonizer; faithful allies or rebellious adversaries to colonial authority. Over time, these imputed properties could acquire a life of their own, and become assimilated into group self-images; certainly, this has occurred for ethnic groups such as the Chagga, Kasai Luba, Ibo, or Bamileke, who enjoyed relatively</page><page sequence="10">80 CRAWFORD YOUNG positive stereotypes as aggressive, competitive, and keen for "modernization." Important policy choices were made based on such collective images. Military recruitment, for example, especially for the British and the Belgians, was concentrated upon groups perceived as "martial races," a doctrine that emerged in early nineteenth century India and became firmly rooted dogma after the Sepoy Rebellion in 1857.30 The uneven distribution of opportunities for social mobility arose from the new avenues for upward movement that became available during the colonial period. Over time, the location of a town, the route followed by road or railway, the siting of a school, the proximity of a major employer?all had an important cumulative impact in endowing some groups with much more numerous and visible elites than others. A growing recognition of this pattern, generally unperceived before World War II, was central to the rise of ethnic self consciousness in the postwar years. Aggressive groups, who savored the esteem accorded to the successful, redoubled their efforts to move upward. Those groups that suddenly discovered themselves scorned as "backwards," and threatened with subordination, mobilized themselves socially and politically to claim their share of the "national cake." Thus during the three quarters of a century of colonialism in Africa, quite novel patterns of social stratification were taking form, shaped by the colonial state itself, the status values it introduced, and the peripheral capitalism it sponsored. Simultaneously, sea changes were occurring in the cultural configu rations in the social consciousness; here again, the colonial state itself played a central role. The end of colonialism brought important changes in the nature and doctrine of the state, which in turn had repercussions for the dynamics of class and cultural pluralism. Class, Ethnicity, and the Independent State Outside the colonized lands, the identification of the nation with the juridical state had become widely accepted by the twentieth century. The nation, a warm, vibrant, anthropomorphic being, was a higher form than the cold, inanimate, legal state; a state that deemed itself modern had within it the seeds of nationhood, however multicultural its society might be. With indepen dence, the idea of the "state" in Africa became fused for the first time with the concept of "nation." The prestige of the nation-state was perhaps never higher than at the moment of African independence, for the cultural autonomy and solidarity movements worldwide that punctuated the 1960s and 1970s were not yet perceptible. "National integration" was no mere neologism of the political scientist, but a powerful imperative to the intelligentsia and leadership of the newly independent states. Few voices at the time would have challenged the conclusion of Carl Friedrich: "Such is the dialectic of the political that the state seeks and must seek to foster the growth of a nation, indeed must posit its potential coming into being."31 The idea of the nation became attached of necessity to the territorial entities of the colonial partition. This process began as the nationalist challenge to imperial rule gathered force. Although at the earliest stages pan-territorial movements were common {Rassemblement D?mocratique Africain, Etoile Nord</page><page sequence="11">PATTERNS OF SOCIAL CONFLICT: STATE, CLASS, AND ETHNICITY 81 Africain, West African Student Union, among others), as the struggle was joined with colonial power, the practical logic of combat dictated organization within the existing territorial frame. The very process of building a solidarity capable of challenging the colonizer required endowing the territorial unit with a new legitimacy. After independence, an intense awareness of the fragility of power engendered unitary state formulas for its exercise and political slogans of the "one leader, one party, one nation" variety. At the international level, the nascent African concert of nations made into a fundamental postulate of inter African public law the sanctity of existing colonial boundaries. Over time, this creed has hardened into immutable dogma. The second fundamental development in the nature of the state is its rapid and multifaceted expansion, which began in the postwar years of defensive colonialism, reflecting in part a political response to the immense clamor for amenities?schools, clinics, roads, a safe water supply. The expanded provision of such services requires large numbers of additional state employees?above all, in the education system; the number of teachers in Za?re, for example, expanded from approximately 37,000 in 1960 to over 200,000 in 1979.32 Public expenditures totaled 59 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1974 in Za?re;33 in Tanzania, the fraction of GDP collected by the state increased from 15 percent in 1961 to nearly 35 percent in 1974.34 This remarkable growth in the scope of the state necessarily raises the stakes for all self-conscious social groupings, whether based on strata or ethnicity. Another important consequence of full political independence has been enhanced significance for boundaries and citizenship. This is particularly marked within contiguous zones previously under a single colonial sovereignty. Voltaics in the Ivory Coast are no longer conceived of only as migrant workers, but also as foreign nationals, as are the numerous Kenyan workers in Kampala (Uganda), or the Benin and Senegalese civil servants who once served the French administration throughout former French West Africa. When to this is added the occasional political circumstance that can place whole cultural groups into the status of hostile or suspect communities, it becomes clear why Africa, by the end of the 1970s, had come to harbor the largest number of refugees of any major region, with about half the world total.35 The altered nature of the postcolonial state had an important impact on social class definitions. The most visible and significant was the rapid crystalli zation of a state bourgeoisie, which took form around the political and bureaucratic apparatus of the public sector. As Richard Sklar has cogently argued, in independent Africa, the dynamics of class are shaped by power relations, rather than relations of production.36 Independence opened positions in the upper reaches of the state hierarchy previously closed to Africans; politics created whole new superstructures (legislatures, parties, ministries). For a significant fraction, especially among the political cohort, the exercise of power has opened up opportunities for parallel mercantile activities that bring significant wealth within reach. When contrasted with dominant strata in other regions, there are some particular characteristics of this class that deserve note. Its dependence on the state and proximity to political power are quite exceptional. Put conversely, the state bourgeoisie has little autonomy relative to the state; its standing in society</page><page sequence="12">82 CRAWFORD YOUNG is not rooted in control of property, wealth, or productive facilities. An individual's class membership is contingent upon remaining within the orbit of established political authority; a fall from political grace can be exceedingly costly. Likewise, loss of post can threaten an individual's ability to transmit his high status to the next generation, ordinarily facilitated by enrolling one's children in the superior schools, or possibly abroad. There can be considerable turnover in the specific membership in this dominant class, though as a social category, the state bourgeoisie has congealed into what appears to be a stable feature of the evolving society. There is, of course, considerable variation across the continent. In countries such as Nigeria and Kenya, an African entrepreneurial or capitalist class that does have some autonomy from the state seems to be taking form. Over time, this may occur elsewhere as well, though such processes are inhibited by the very large public sectors created in a number of countries, and not only those inspired by some form of socialist perspective. In South Africa, where power was transferred in 1910 to the white community, the issue is posed in totally different terms; corporate mining empires, industry, large-scale farming, and the professions provide autonomous niches for segments of the white communi ty. They are, however, dependent on the racially defined state to preserve their privileged status.37 There is a distant echo of the state bourgeoisie in the importance of the public sector, which has become unusually large (for a market-economy capitalist state) as the Afrikaner has moved upward since 1948. At the other extreme, for which Za?re may serve as example, the state bourgeoisie is a veritable service class.38 The dependency of the state bourgeoi sie has been systematically used as scaffolding for the current regime, this by way of patrimonial allocation of a substantial fraction of the public resources that pass through state channels.39 By fully exploiting the potential of the state, the regime maintains decisive leverage over the state bourgeoisie, which helps explain the regime's persistence, despite the debilitating crisis and massive disaffection that have engulfed the country. Because the state bourgeoisie is the internally dominant class, and because powerful social formations autonomous from the state are relatively lacking, the link between state and class in Africa is quite different from that which has evolved in the Western state. There, the state always encountered potent forces that were outside its grasp and partly hostile to its growth?the feudal nobility and mercantile capital, and later, industrial and financial capital. The colonial state, on the other hand, acquired full hegemony over all. The mutual impact of the state and the foreign estate changed after independence. The latter was long accustomed to regarding the state as its particular domain. Political indepen dence forced the foreign estate to retreat into the economic realm. Indeed, over time, most of its members whose livelihood depended directly on the state (the colonial servants) departed, to be replaced by a new technocracy of international experts, foreign assistance functionaries, and multinational representatives. Although they initially had significant political influence, in most countries this influence has shriveled; to a degree, the price paid for economic latitude is insulation from internal political conflict. They are, however, important intermediaries in the asymmetrical linkages between the postcolonial state and the industrial world. As a racial category, they continue to enjoy high status,</page><page sequence="13">PATTERNS OF SOCIAL CONFLICT: STATE, CLASS, AND ETHNICITY 83 and their very high consumption standards serve as a reference point for the state bourgeoisie. Here, perhaps, the Ivory Coast is the limiting case, for the foreign estate there has multiplied fivefold since independence, earning about twice what they could expect to make at home, accounting for about a third of the total wage bill in the early 1970s, and remitting $100 million in 1975.40 The dependence of the state upon external transactions (taxation of foreign trade, flows of loans, capital of loans, capital, and aid) to meet its own resource needs guaranteed the role of this category and provided it with leverage. Although the foreign estate could of course only subsist with the cooperation of the state, it was autonomous in a way that the state bourgeoisie was not. More generally, the location of African states in the international system of states plays an important part with respect to the state bourgeoisie as well as the foreign estate. The economic weakness of all but a few renders them highly vulnerable to market fluctuations, the high cost of energy and food imports, and the great difficulty in meeting foreign exchange and state revenue needs. The tributary linkages of debt and aid that arise out of these needs create interdependencies between the state, the state bourgeoisie, and the international system. The physical apparatus of the state requires the skill and services of the state bourgeoisie. The latter depends for its prosperity upon the fiscal and mercantile viability of the state. External creditors, political sponsors, and trading partners acquire an increasing, almost proprietary concern with the stability and survivability of the state (though not necessarily a given regime). Anarchy is as terrifying a concept to the international system as it is to the state bourgeoisie and foreign estate; only the state can assure the repayment of debts and guarantee the continuing flow of vital mineral resources?not to mention the destabilizing risks for the international arena of conflicts growing out of the breakdown of a state. The nature and role of the state were also linked to the rapid expansion of the urban sector. This occurred through the critical part played by the state in employment creation. In a number of countries, private sector employment has stagnated since 1960. For example, public sector employees in Congo increased from 4,000 in 1960 to over 36,000 in 1972, at which time they accounted for 53 percent of all wage employment.41 The very effectiveness of the state in expanding education systems and, negatively, the disappointments of its rural development efforts accelerated flight to the cities by the young, for whom life in the village offered only assured poverty. The sheer scale of state consumption tended to direct resources to cities and towns associated with the governmental apparatus, particularly the capital. Many of the new urban immigrants who were unable to find regular jobs sought subsistence in the burgeoning informal sector as petty traders, artisans, purveyors of personal services, and messengers. Some turned to pilferage and prostitution.42 The postcolonial state has also had a noteworthy impact on ethnicity. In its fundamental approach to the issue of cultural pluralism, it has differed sharply from its colonial predecessor. The latter was an alien, racial entity, apart from the dominated society. The postcolonial state, on the other hand, embraced the doctrine of state as nation-in-becoming, thereby projecting its own image as a higher synthesis of society. "Nation-building" was everywhere placed at the top of the agenda.</page><page sequence="14">84 CRAWFORD YOUNG Few imagined that the national identity to be created was to supercede ethnic affiliation. Rather, it was to transcend ethnicity, by superposing a historically higher and ethically superior form of human solidarity. A folkloric attachment to the ethnic community was harmless and acceptable, but its elevation as the basis for collective claims upon the state was wrong. Only the nation has full status as a recognized and totally legitimate conception of solidarity. For the most part, the concept of nation to be developed was a culturally neutral one, distinct from any of the particular cultural entities within the territorial boundaries. From the inanimate material of the state, a living sense of community was to be created. There were exceptions to this, in the Arab tier of states in North Africa and those states that were lineal descendants of a precolonial state or community (Swaziland, Lesotho, and Somalia, for exam ple). The two states that were for the most part outside the colonial universe, Liberia and Ethiopia, were also somewhat different; in each, there was a founding community that took in its charge the destinies and expansion of the state during the nineteenth century (Americo-Liberians, Amhara). The inabil ity to project a national image of the state distinct from these groups played no small part in the Sergeant Doe 1980 coup in Liberia and the rebellions around the periphery of Ethiopia beginning in the 1960s. South Africa was also a special case; in particular, from the official adoption of apartheid as state ideology in 1948, the concept of "nation" was restricted to the white communi ty. Africans were defined as outside the national community, through legal assignment to ten "homelands," to which the state assigned a set of cultural classifications. The Asian and colored communities were conceived as subordi nate racial categories, not entitled to the normal prerogatives of full citizenship that membership in the "nation" would provide.43 A number of strategies were pursued in executing the nation-building design. The colonial pattern of avid classification largely ceased; indeed, the state frequently sought to replace ethnic categories by those based on territory. Many ceased employing ethnicity or maternal languages as a census category. Even states such as Zaire, while adopting policies of "affirmative action" on behalf of disadvantaged groups, applied the protective quotas to administrative subdivisions, not to ethnic groups. Thus the overly exuberant celebration of ethnicity is viewed with suspicion by the state. A number have forbidden the formation of ethnic associations, which were generally tolerated by the colonial state. Cultural entrepreneurs who use such structures as a base for the elaboration of ethnic ideologies are thereby denied a crucial organizational resource.44 Demonstrations for protest action to support ethnic claims are a dangerous threat; one recent illustration was the sharp reaction of the Algerian regime to student action in Tizi-Ouzou in April 1980 calling for recognition of the Berber cultural heritage. That politicized ethnicity is a potential?and potent?threat to the nation building mission has been a prime factor in the widespread adoption of single party or military formulas of governance, where open political competition is averted. In most instances, some effort is made to project an image of the state as a faithful representation of the nation by ensuring that major regions and groups are included in the ruling group. The considerable symbol-wielding machinery</page><page sequence="15">PATTERNS OF SOCIAL CONFLICT: STATE, CLASS, AND ETHNICITY 85 of the state as well as the socializing agencies?schools and the media?all play their part in spreading the idea of nationality. This effort seems to have had real impact: passive submission to the colonial state has been widely replaced by an active consciousness of national identifica tion.45 At the same time, the aim of communicating a culturally neutral image of nation is not always achieved. Rwanda is unambiguously associated with Hutu domination, as is Burundi with Tutsi. The perception is widespread in Za?re that the state is identified with an Equateur and Lingalaphone inner core; conversely, certain regions believe themselves to be outcast, for example, by a 1978 ordinance forbidding military recruitment in Bandundu and the two Kasais. As for Ethiopia, in recent years, regions of the cultural periphery? Somali, Eritrea, and Oromo?have succeeded in creating a counterimage of the state as colonial occupant, rather than nation.46 At the very least, the territorial personality of the state has been strongly affirmed. In colonial times, when most of Africa fell under the sway of four colonial powers, the discontinuities between territories dependent upon a common external sovereign were not sharply drawn. Since independence, the fifty-four sovereign polities have constituted distinctive, bounded arenas within which class formation and ethnic definitions occur. Two decades ago, there was little to distinguish, say, Zambia (Northern Rhodesia) from Malawi (Nyasa land), Rwanda from Burundi, the Ivory Coast from Benin. Today, the texture of the state and the configurations of class and ethnicity within it are of growing specificity. Class in Contemporary Africa Thus far, we have considered class and ethnicity in conjunction with the state. Let us set aside the latter, and direct our attention explicitly to these two patterns of societal cleavage?affiliation and differentiation?whose particular dynamics require closer scrutiny. Earlier we considered three key categories in the African context: the foreign estate, the state bourgeoisie, and the informal sector. With respect to the first two categories, which are the dominant social classes, we need not retrace our steps. Yet a few words more need to be said about the informal sector. In many cities, informal sector activity accounts for a large fraction of the urban populace. One extreme case is Kananga, the second largest city in Zaire; in 1973 there were only 10,000 recorded jobs for a population of over 400,000.47 The myriad activities, almost all small-scale, that comprise this sector, as well as the importance of kinship and clientage as instrumentalities of survival, serve to inhibit the social mobilization of this group. Although the mainly impoverished participants in the informal sector economy are well aware of the two dominant classes, their shared poverty alone does not seem to foster a collective consciousness. The "informal sector" thus conceived includes those persons who might otherwise be classified as an unemployment lumpenproletariat. Indeed, many consider themselves to be "unemployed," in that they do not hold regular wage employment, and continue to seek a steady job actively. Although unskilled workers often earn very low wages indeed, their regularity provides a degree of</page><page sequence="16">86 CRAWFORD YOUNG predictability and a small measure of security, compared to the high uncertainty and irregularity surrounding much informal sector activity. While waiting for a steady job, however, most cannot rely on handouts from kin; the survival pursuits of the informal sector are therefore a practical necessity. For this reason, this large category of the urban poor seems to be best described through their informal sector membership rather than as "unemployed" or some derivative term. Four other social categories deserve mention. One newly emerging at the upper end of the economic scale in some countries?in some respects, a mirror image of the informal sector at the lower end?is what might be termed the magendo class. The lexical referent itself is new; the term, of Swahili origin, has gained currency as a general descriptor of the black market, or underground, economy in East Africa, which is particularly widespread in Uganda. Magendo thrives on the decay of the state; it flourishes where the probity, competence, and effectiveness of the state are corroded. In countries such as Uganda, Ghana, or Za?re, magendo becomes a very large part of the economy?estimated by one economist as 50 percent of Uganda's total economy in 1979.48 If such figures are conceivable, those who occupy this niche of the market may deserve recognition as a distinct and potentially powerful social category.49 Beyond magendo, there is probably a growing group of purveyors of services to the state (the ubiquitous "contractor" in Nigeria, building roads and schools) and merchant communities (the Bamileke in Cameroon) who are distinct from the state bourgeoisie and partly autonomous from the state. A significant group in the towns is what might be termed a petty bourgeoisie, or lower middle class of white-collar employees?clerks, secre taries, nurses, and the like. A short three decades ago, this category ranked relatively high in the African community in status terms, and was poised for the spectacular social leap upward that Africanization of various bureaucracies would bring. Today the petty bourgeoisie is d?class?; it no longer has high prestige, its mobility prospects are blocked by the availability of more highly educated persons for top echelon posts, and its relative income has often declined. Although the working class is no longer primarily migratory, relatively few African states have a really substantial stratum of wage laborers; South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Egypt are among the few exceptions.50 Those employed by large foreign corporations were frequently somewhat better remunerated than other workers, and those with jobs were certainly more fortunate than their fellows in the informal sector, or most in the countryside. In a context where all were poor, this slight edge in well-being gave rise to the controversial "labor aristocracy" thesis, which many of these workers now feel placed too much stress on their marginal advantage over the peasantry, rather than their absolute poverty.51 In recent years, private sector employment opportunities in many countries have not expanded, while a very large reserve army of job applicants is penned into the informal sector. Many of the major development projects employ relatively few workers; oil in Nigeria, the backbone of the economy, provides fewer than 20,000 jobs. Gabon, which has a remarkably (and deceptively) high per capita national income of $3,750, derives nearly all of its wealth from oil wells and uranium and manganese mines, and these employ under 1,000, just over 1,000, and 3,500. GECAMINES, the major copper</page><page sequence="17">PATTERNS OF SOCIAL CONFLICT: STATE, CLASS, AND ETHNICITY 87 producer in Za?re, in 1980-81 exported several times the volume of copper exported in the 1920s, with fewer workers. Working-class organizations?trade unions?are generally kept under firm tutelage by incumbent regimes (though this is not always effective: for example, Upper Volta in 1980 and Tanzania in 1971-72). Thus, although symptoms of labor unrest are quite frequent, they are usually confined to particular enterprises. In only a few countries (such as Congo and South Africa) can one speak of a proletarian consciousness that weighs heavily in the social equation.52 We come, finally, to the peasantry. Only a handful of countries can point to improving conditions in the countryside (the Ivory Coast, Cameroon, possibly Kenya and Tunisia). In most, smallholders continue to carry the heavy fiscal burden that characterized the colonial era, especially through export taxation. African states have widely recognized in the last few years that their pricing policies on both export crops and staple foods (a form of indirect taxation) have discouraged production. What is only now being appreciated is that peasants have the option of "exit"53?the shift into growing crops that can be sold outside the official marketing channels, or the diversion of export produce into magendo circuits.54 The one major benefit delivered to the countryside has been the dramatic expansion of the primary school system. Yet even this, although sustaining the hope of upward social movement for the next generation, has the effect of withdrawing labor from the rural economy, and thus increasing the burden on the women and the elderly who remain behind. There can be no doubt that a widespread perception of relative deprivation exists among the peasantry. There is also a shrewd awareness that the interests of the state and the small farmer are partly in conflict; the state wants export production that can be taxed, and cheap, abundant food supplies to curb urban unrest, while the peasant seeks higher returns per unit of agricultural labor. However widely shared this perception, it must be clearly distinguished from a collective consciousness. Outside of a few exceptions, the modest class of petty capitalist farmers that emerged in the latter years of colonial rule has neither expanded rapidly nor consolidated. States have generally imposed high rates of taxation on the export crops on which their relative prosperity was based, and pricing policies have generally worked to their disadvantage. Also, except for the latter half of the 1970s, world market prices for their main crops have not matched the high levels of the early postwar years. Although a few countries have actively pursued policies beneficial to the interests of this class?for example, the Ivory Coast, Kenya, or Malawi?the majority have not, and in some cases, the state has been downright hostile (Nkrumah's Ghana and Tanzania). Only in the Ivory Coast did large numbers of the political class originate in the petty capitalist planter group. Despite the fears sometimes expressed of the social danger constituted by "kulaks," commercial farmers are not usually a part of the politically dominant social categories. These farmers, of course, are to be sharply distinguished from some members of the state bourgeoisie who have acquired, primarily through political access, former European farms or plantations.55 Central to the problematic of class in Africa is the pace of change and the indeterminacy of categories. Three decades ago, such classifications as state bourgeoisie, magendo, or informal sector were unknown, the foreign estate</page><page sequence="18">88 CRAWFORD YOUNG occupied a very different role, and the working class was still in large part migratory. Class must thus be viewed as a dynamic concept; to achieve this, Michael Schatzberg proposes that strata categories be conceived of as proces sual. His approach may be summarized in three propositions: Social classes are constantly changing in response to differing socio political contexts The individual actor can, and does, belong to different class alliances at the same time The degree of class identity will vary, depending on the geographic, social, political, and economic junctures of the moment in question56 I have already shown how the pervasiveness of the state plays a part in shaping this process. So also does the changing character of the political economy: the structure of production; patterns of wealth generation and distribution; options available to the young at the point where they become assigned to adult socioeconomic roles; status ranking of various likelihoods. The international system influences the outcome as well, through its impact on production patterns, the external models of consumption and hierarchy that it supplies, and the linkages it sustains through the foreign estate. Finally, the degree of social mobility, on the one hand, and mechanisms of social closure, on the other, are key determinants of stratification over time. The first quarter century after World War II was an era of exceptional opportunities for social mobility. Educational systems were swiftly expanded almost everywhere, and Africans gained access for the first time to the upper ranks of political, administrative, and economic hierarchies. This process has slowed perceptibly in the last decade, as the one-time opportunities offered by Africanization of the state apparatus in particular have been utilized. Yet the Africans' belief in the possibility of upward mobility appears to remain strong, nourished by the now general availability of primary schools, and the knowl edge in most villages that some of their sons and daughters have broken through to the upper echelons.57 Social closure may become an increasingly widespread phenomenon, how ever, especially in states where little economic expansion has occurred in recent years. In the colonial era, closure was maintained by racial barriers, the method of exclusion still in use today in South Africa. Possibly these are being replaced by the class-based transmission of privilege across generations. Members of the state bourgeoisie perhaps do not consciously intend to erect such barriers, but they will naturally make every effort to guarantee the life-chances of their own children, especially through investment in their education. If the size of the top strata cannot be expanded, almost inevitably a disproportionate fraction will over time be recruited from within its own ranks.58 Cultural Pluralism Contemporary cultural pluralism, or ethnicity, has been strongly affected by the various processes termed "modernization." Far from eroding attach</page><page sequence="19">PATTERNS OF SOCIAL CONFLICT: STATE, CLASS, AND ETHNICITY 89 ments of ethnicity and religion, modernization is quite likely to strengthen them. The spread of education brings higher levels of social consciousness, which may include a more highly articulated cultural identity. The extension and intensification of communication networks brings individuals within reach of broader collectivities; thus an ethnic affiliation that may have been highly localized becomes extended over a broader zone of cultural affinity. The rapid growth of cities creates social arenas where competition for survival is intense, and where the consciousness of other groups locked in combat for the same resources deepens. The importance of scarcity of resources and competition for status in the crystallization of contemporary identities can hardly be overstated. In the localized, subsistence-oriented rural world of yore, there was little resource competition to sharpen the "we-they" sense across broad groups. The incorpo ration of populations within the frame of a national political economy, and the multiple arenas for encounter and conflict that this creates (schools, jobs, housing, political power, to mention but a few), have fostered novel patterns of cultural self-consciousness. Of these competitive arenas, political power has particular importance. Few observers or African political leaders in the 1950s foresaw the force of ethnic and religious factors in politics, because within the colonial framework of white racial hegemony, political competition among Africans was unlikely to occur. When the surge to independence occurred, colonizers generally transferred to the newly created states the constitutional machinery and procedures of Western states; legitimacy was to be determined by competitive elections. Inevitably, in a number of countries, the surest way for aspiring political leaders to build constituencies was to mobilize their own ethnic clientele. The citizenry became aware that not only were they being pressed to rally behind their own ethnic leadership, but also that other groups were being similarly courted. Thus crept in the fear of possible domination through electoral numbers, and a crescendo of mutually reinforcing suspicions. Ethnic solidarity in the political realm, if perhaps viewed with intellectual misgivings, became a defensive necessity. The process is well conveyed by the autobio graphical reflections of a leading Zairian scholar, recollecting the mood on the eve of independence. Especially for the young Luba of my generation in Katanga, the agony of this situation stemmed not only from our sense of internal conflict as we struggled to find a personal and collective identity; it arose as well from the sense of frustration which we experienced in interaction with others. The people of the other ethnic groups, indeed, would not accept us as individuals, according to our own self definition, whatever we attempted, but strictly on the basis of the straitjacketing definitions they already held of us.59 The sheer drama of competitive elections, the uncertainties concerning what independence would really be like, and the pervasive fears of domination resulted in the politicization of ethnicity. Through this process, categories of identity became much more salient in the social consciousness, and gave rise to widespread anxieties and insecurities. The extreme case was .Nigeria, with civil war the final consequence of newly politicized ethnicity. The sentiments that</page><page sequence="20">90 CRAWFORD YOUNG attended the bitter strife of the early 1960s were recapitulated, on the brink of civil war, with candor and eloquence by one of the northern delegates to a constitutional conference: We all have our fears of one another. Some fear that opportunities in their own areas are limited and they would therefore wish to expound [sic] and venture unhampered in other parts. Some fear the sheer weight of numbers of other parts which they feel could be used to the detriment of their own interests. Some fear the sheer weight of skills and the aggressive drive of other groups which they feel has to be regulated if they are not to be left as the economic, social, and possibly political under-dogs in their own areas of origin in the very near future. These fears may be real or imagined; they may be reasonable or petty. Whether they are genuine or not, they have to be taken account of because they influence to a considerable degree the actions of the groups towards one another and, more important perhaps, the daily actions of the individual in each group towards individuals from other groups.60 Concomitant with the politicization process was the elaboration of cultural ideologies. In the case of religious groups, these of course are deeply rooted in theology, sacred writings, and ritual. For ethnic groups, however, an ideologi cal articulation must be created. This is to be found in the standardization of languages through grammars and dictionaries, in the codification of custom through ethnic monographs, and in the creative synthesis of the past through historical study. All of these lend dignity and worth to a cultural group. Cultural ideology-building in Africa began early in the colonial period, primarily by missionaries, but it was also the work of some amateur anthropologist administrators. In the interwar period, the work of creating a cultural ideology became the domain of the professional anthropologist, usually someone from the metropolitan country. After World War II, it was internationalized, but especially Africanized.61 Few, if any, consciously viewed themselves as creators of a cultural ideology; nonetheless, an intellectual elaboration of the identity occurred around their works. There was also an important didactic function to be performed. Cultural identities are not innate, but acquired through a social and psychological learning process.62 Although much of this can occur through the informal education of the kinship system, schools and other socializing agencies became available. During the heyday of the 1950s, ethnic associations often performed this role with considerable energy. One such emissary of cultural conscious ness, former Ibo Federal Union general secretary B. O. N. Eluwa, noted the magnitude of the task; in his travels through eastern Nigeria during the period from 1947 to 1951, he found that many rural citizens "could not even imagine all Ibos."63 David Abernethy aptly portrays the role of these didactic agents: What was the best course of action open to the urban migrant who was acutely concerned lest his ethnic group fall behind others in the struggle for wealth, power and status? Certainly the rural masses had to be informed of the problem. If the masses were not aware of their ethnicity, then they would have to learn who they really were through the efforts of "ethnic missionaries" returning to the homeland. These "missionaries" would also have to outline a strategy by which the ethnic group, once fully conscious of its unity and its potential, could compete with its rivals.64</page><page sequence="21">PATTERNS OF SOCIAL CONFLICT: STATE, CLASS, AND ETHNICITY 91 The fluid and multilayered nature of ethnicity remains, despite the higher levels of consciousness and ideological articulation. A handful of examples, of the infinite number that might be cited, will illustrate this point. In Nigeria, were the Ibo of the former Midwest Region really part of the same group as these of the Eastern Region? Their ambiguous reactions to the Biafra secession speak to the indeterminacy of this question. Are Kongo and Lari in Congo one group or two? Although both speak the same language and refer to a common historical tradition, the Lari of the Brazzaville region generally utilize that ethnonym, while recognizing affinities with Kongo culture more broadly. In Uganda, for some purposes and at some conjunctures, a "Bantu" categorization for most of the southern populations has had some social meaning in distin guishing them from northerners of different linguistic origin, dietary habits, and physical appearance. Yet for most purposes, "Ganda," "Soga," "Kiga," or "Gisu" was more relevant. Most individuals, in short, have more than one cultural identity. Which has relevance will depend upon the situational context. So also will context determine the saliency and intensity of identities. In Nigeria, for example, in a climate of impending civil war, ethnic identities were incandescent. In the era of good feeling that followed the federal triumph and the generally successful reconciliation process, ethnicity was much more subdued. In Za?re, it can be shown that in the last three decades, a change in the political arena has produced major changes in the categories of ethnic conflict. In the late 1950s, electoral competition first occurred in the cities, and categories of conflict reflected the ethnic images current in the urban center. In 1960 attention shifted to the national arena, and a different set of groups came into play, the game requiring the maximization of rural numbers. In 1962-63 new provinces were created, largely on the basis of ethnic self-determination, that brought yet other ethnic categorizations into play. The situation changed once again during the 1964-65 rebellions, when groups were forced to choose between insurgents and the national government, by a complex calculus of perceived affinity and the assessment of the relative strength of the two sides. Finally, the centralized, unitary state with a single political party in the Mobutu era removed the possibility of overt ethnic competition, and drove ethnicity underground.65 Yet another element of complexity is the quite rapid process of linguistic change in contemporary Africa. Perhaps the most important is the spread of regional lingua francas; languages such as Arabic, Hausa, Swahili, or Lingala have remarkably enlarged their geographical range in recent decades, and penetrated more deeply into the rural periphery. Perhaps this is why the irrepressible Libyan president, Wanis al-Qaadafi, can argue to Saharan popula tions, such as the Touareg and Toubou, that they are really part of the Arab community. In Tanzania, it was estimated that only 52 percent of the population could speak Swahili in 1942; more recent estimates are 90 percent or more.66 A recent survey of secondary school students in Kisangani showed that not only nearly all spoke Swahili or Lingala (frequently both), but no less than 52 percent spoke Swahili as a maternal language, as did 10 percent for Lingala. When one considers that this adoption of the lingua franca as maternal language cannot extend back more than a generation or two at the most, and that both</page><page sequence="22">92 CRAWFORD YOUNG these languages were unknown in the region 120 years ago, the scale of change is remarkable.67 Much less clear than the mere fact of linguistic change are the cultural implications. Surely they will be substantial, and will partly reorder cultural geography. One may speculate that broad regional identities associated with the lingua franca will become relatively more salient. * * * Let us now draw together the threads in this essay by returning to the interrelationships of state, class, and ethnicity. The interaction between the three is the heart of the matter; though analytically distinct, these elements constantly interpenetrate in daily life. Although the discussion will proceed on general lines, it must be recognized that each nation-state arena has a unique class and cultural pluralism configuration, which in turn produces different outcomes. The phenomenon of inequality is a useful point of departure. While inequality is as old as human society, in the contemporary world, its potential to generate conflict is intensified by the commanding moral force of the egalitarian precepts that permeate nearly all modern ideologies. James Coleman expresses this point well, when he places the drive for equality at the heart of the "development syndrome": "Whether viewed as a factual trend, a perceived technological possibility, or simply as the dominant aspiration underlying the drive for change, egalitarianism pervades all aspects of modern political life and culture and all forms of modern political ideology."68 In one way or another, the public doctrine of the modern state, in Africa as elsewhere, sanctifies the equal status of all citizens, and in recent years this doctrine has been extended beyond mere legal equality to include social and economic dimensions. The egalitarian concept invests both class and ethnicity with a transcendent norm in the pursuit of material interest.69 In classical liberal thought, equality was a property to be measured at the individual level; in the more collective epistemologies of the present century, however, inequality is stigmatized in terms of social categories. Once the purely individualistic liberal conception of egalitarianism is set aside, the door opens for demands that equality be measured in terms of relative returns to ethnic communities. Not only is equality measured increasingly in collective terms, but also the vast expansion in the range of state activity places many more of the causes of inequality within the public realm. Daniel Bell argues this point: The essential point about the change from market... to political decisions is that in the latter instance everyone knows where the decision will be made. ... A market is dispersed, and the actors largely "invisible." In politics, decisions are made in a cockpit, and confrontation is direct. Inevitably, therefore, the spread of political decision-making forces the organization of persons into communal and interest groups, defensively to protect their places and privileges, or advantageous ly to gain place and privilege.70 Put otherwise, if there is a perception that a social stratum (workers) or an ethnic group is disadvantaged, the responsibility falls to the state.</page><page sequence="23">PATTERNS OF SOCIAL CONFLICT: STATE, CLASS, AND ETHNICITY 93 The most prestigious ideologies in the contemporary world?socialism, in its diverse forms, and liberalism?tend to place a negative valuation on cultural pluralism, and in different ways validate class-oriented perceptions of society. This frame of ideological discourse is of primary significance to the intelligen tsia, politicized youth, and political leadership. No less does it seek to downplay cultural solidarity, labeling it a symptom of backwardness, a false form of social consciousness that impedes the mobilization of the popular sectors or citizenry at-large for common purposes. On the other hand, cultural solidarities have symbolic resources for communal mobilization that are much more powerful than anything operating under the guise of class. As A. L. Epstein puts it, above and beyond whatever objective factors sustain ethnicity lies "the powerful emotional charge that appears to surround or to underlie so much of ethnic behavior; and it is this affective dimension of the problem that seems to me lacking in so many recent attempts to tackle it."71 Bell adds that contemporary ethnicity appears more salient than class, "because it can combine an interest with an affective tie."72 The kinds of emotions, anxieties, fears, and insecurities that can be triggered by ethnic conflict have no real counterpart in class conflict. In the death-filled episodes of violent confrontation in independent Africa over the last two decades, only the 1964-65 Zaire rebellions occurred primarily within a class derived set of social perceptions, although here as well, ethnic elements interpenetrated. This intensity of ethnic conflict exists despite the fact that inequality is much more clearly linked to social class?where it is indeed axiomatic. Ethnic inequality, on the other hand, is largely in the eye of the beholder. A belief that ethnic inequality exists can gain currency when substantial numbers of elite members of a given group become highly visible. In reality, the great majority of members of all groups are poor, and the social advantage of a given ethnic community is usually quite relative. Yet the connotations of domination suggested by a more numerous elite from one group awaken the deepest anxieties in the others. One structural factor that binds together state, class, and ethnicity is the pervasiveness of patron-client relationships. These bonding mechanisms, en countered at all levels of society, occur within the metaphorical framework of kinship, though they do not necessarily imply real family ties. They are, however, usually internal to a cultural community. Deference and services are exchanged for protection and favor; there is at once intimacy and inequality. The formation of patron ties in urban circumstances is partly necessitated by the nature of the state and the many everyday difficulties in dealing with it. An ordinary problem?obtaining a permit, avoiding a sanction?that may be extremely difficult for a poor person to resolve through routine channels, will be handled expeditiously when the appropriate intermediary patron intervenes. Coping with misfortune, access to schools, employment, and the like are among the innumerable problems besetting the urbanit?, where help from a patron may be crucial. The formation of patron-client ties is an unending process, and has no specific, ironclad rules. The client needs to establish some form of affinity to a</page><page sequence="24">94 CRAWFORD YOUNG patron; kinship is the most reliable basis for claim, though not the only one. Mere common ethnicity normally would not be enough; others, observing a patron intervening on behalf of a client, however, are quite likely to interpret the transaction as ethnic. The pervasiveness of the patron-client phenomenon tends to sustain a complex network of transclass affiliations. Some observers go further to argue that they are an engine transforming social class tensions into ethnic antagonisms.73 Embodied in these relationships is a prime contradiction of the contempo rary state: it is at once hard and distant, soft and permeable. In its habits and operating modes, the state reflects the inertial perpetuation of its colonial past; in its command style, the domination that gave it birth persists. Observe a government office: it retains yet the preceptorial flavor of the days when clients and petitioners were mere subjects of its alien hegemony.74 Yet Bula Matari hardness coexists with the myriad access points to the state that flow through the patron-client networks of the state bourgeoisie. Indeed, so pervasive'are these networks, some observers argue that the state is fatally softened, and rendered incapable of imposing choices and priorities that are indispensable to state-directed economic growth.75 Certainly these networks operate partly to defuse the social antagonisms generated by the great gap in material well-being between the state bourgeoisie and lower social strata. The perception of this social inequality is very widespread. Yet many hope to gain some benefits, which would otherwise be denied, through the redistributive channels of patron-client networks?and some do succeed. Although such success does not remove the anger over formal distributive inequities, some of its sting doubtless disappears. State, class, and ethnicity are all in a condition of flux in Africa today. No doubt many will accept the premise that the crux of societal conflict is found in the intersection between these three macro variables. The vastly more difficult task is to go beyond this effortless observation to unravel the dynamics of their interaction in any given setting. References 'Not the least of the paradoxes is that the one African state that stands as an exception to the independence-optimism equation is Libya, considered in 1952, when it became a sovereign state, as a hopeless ward of the international community. Libya today has the highest per capita income in Africa, and has become an expanding power in its own right. 2For some important recent conceptual discussions, see "The State," Daedalus 108 (4) (Fall 1979); J.

Useful recent recapitulations can be found in Bob Jessop, "Recent Theories of the Capitalist State," Cambridge Journal of Economics 1 (1977): 353-73; David A. Gold, Clarence Y. H.

Those of a Marxist persuasion, in particular, would prefer a more deductive approach, deriving class from the combination of the dominant capitalist mode of production, understood within the international framework of imperialism and the survivals from precapitalist social formations. 9This definition is influenced by A. L. Epstein, Ethos and Identity (London: Tavistock Publications, 1978). The literature on ethnicity, as with class, is now very great.

"The term Bula Matari was coined to characterize Henry Stanley, who, as a state-builder in the service of King Leopold II, forged a path across difficult terrain around the Congo River rapids, for his caravans bearing dismantled steamers. Over time, the term became a designation for the colonial state and its European agents. 12From a different perspective, a related point is given intriguing consideration in Hamza Alavi, "The State in Post-Colonial Societies: Pakistan and Bangladesh," New Left Review 23 (July-August 1972): 59-81. Alavi argues that the colonial state was "overdeveloped," because it had to subdue the dominant classes in colonized society. 1'Elizabeth Colson, "African Society at the Time of the Scramble," in L.
