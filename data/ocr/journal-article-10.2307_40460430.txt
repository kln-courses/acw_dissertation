<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shan kho: The Essence of Misfortune E. Paul Durrenberger Abstract. - For the Shan, Tai Yai, of Maehongsorn Province in Thailand, kho is not a spirit proper. The Shan do not placate or propitiate it. Rather, kho is misfortune personified. When it strikes, whether it be caused by witchcraft, fever, disease, people try to send it away. They attempt to improve their Buddhist merit to prevent its evil effects. This paper describes how these Shan treat kho. The relevance of these observations for understanding Buddhism in the area is briefly indicated. [Thailand, Buddhism, Super- natural Beings] Shan, Tai Long, of Thailand's Maehongsorn Province are devout Buddhists. Like other Buddhists in Southeast Asia, they also interact with a number of superhuman beings whose existence and power they posit. One of these is called kho. Occasionally, when a child is sick or not sleeping well people attribute the malady to kho. Cushing (1914:127) translates this as to have an emaciating disase: to be sick repeatedly, supposed to be caused by the evil influence of the plan- ets. Nash (1965:185) says of Burma that: In any prolonged illness, the horoscope is consulted, and, if there is a planetary force involved in the illness, certain rites are undertaken. The chief ritual is giving food to, or for, the planetary deity or spirit to placate it or cause it to be beneficial. It is akin, of course, to the sacrificial idiom in Buddhism proper, to nat [ spirit ] feed, and to monk feed, and it says the same thing: A supplicant or inferior spiritual power asks the power- ful to protect him, to turn evil from him. Shan may send kho away if they suspect it is causing misfortune. In the Shan village of Thongmakhsan I saw few ceremonies to send away kho. If people attribute misfortunes of adults to kho they strengthen their own power by augmenting their Buddhist merit, khuso. Lisu highlanders also E.

Lisu invariably send it away or drive it away. They do not attempt to strengthen the power of the individual kho may attack. Lisu are not Buddhists and have no notion of merit or karma in the Buddhist sense. For Lisu, kho is not a spirit proper, but an occult agent whose power is less than human power (Durrenberger 1971). Neither is kho a. spirit proper for Shan. If we examine several examples of how Shan treat kho we can see the importance of strengthening one's own power to protect against it and that it is not in the same category of supernatural agents as spirits. A child was sick and his parents had asked Lung Khön, a hsara, to help them. Hsara literally means 'teacher,' but it is used to refer to those who have esoteric knowledge, especially of healing, astrology, selecting auspicious days, and who are familiar with books. Lung Khön went to the house and made a tray. He made the bottom of bamboo splints and covered it with banana leaves, then made sides of the outer layers of a banana tree trunk and attached handles to two sides. Each household has an altar on its eastern side with an image of the Buddha and a container for flowers on it. Lung Khön whispered at the altar and presented a bowl of bananas, paper flags, a paper umbrella, and banana leaves, and put it on the altar. He said the umbrella represented the head of the Buddha, on top; the flags, the Buddha's ears; the bananas, his fingers; the red flag, his tongue; the white flag, the face and cheeks of the Buddha; and the banana leaves represent the Buddha. He placed in the tray two dried fish, one piece of beancake, one pre- pared package of chewing betel, and five piles of cooked rice and repeated three times, "I have prepared food for kho." He then moved the basket over the child's head and lit a torch made of pine splints and said, "kho, you had better go stay on the road and I will send you all this food." He waved the torch over the child's head and blew over the torch. He then whispered a katha or spell and said, "All the bad things (myo am li) go out of the child's body today. All one thousand and ninety -eight kho go out. Kho that ties our hands with rope, kho that can kill with guns, kho that stabs with the knife must go away." He blew over the torch toward the child's head and said, "kho an tsang tep ho (kho which is ac- customed to cutting off the head) go away." He blew over the torch to- ward the child's head again and repeated twice more his entreaty that kho leave. He then said: Mang khu lo (an animal which makes noises to scare children in the forest) must go away. Kho under the house, kho upstairs in the house, go away. Male kho who wears a loin cloth must go away; female kho who wears a long skirt must go away; kho that carries the baby must go away; kho who has breasts like an old woman must go away, kho that looks like a Karen with large ear holes, the ugly one, must go away; all these kho go to your place where you live; do not come here and trouble the child. Tei wa khun phi khn tsang (superior spirits) protect us like an umbrella. I am the hsara and I must be victorious over these evil spirits. Anthropos 77.1982 2</page><page sequence="3">18 E. Paul Durrenberger Anthropos 77.1982 Lung Khön said another katha to protect himself and said, "We depend on the nine facts to protect us from evil spirits." Lung Khön did not know what the nine facts were. He waved the torch over the child's head and left the house carrying the tray and torch in his left hand. He left them in the forest north of the house, but inside the village, spit into the basket twice, and returned to the house. Lung Khön explained that he had whispered a katha at the altar to pay respect to the superior spirits, his parents, tsau möng, the spirit of the country, and to ask all the good spirits to help him. Cushing (1914:22) translates katha as a stanza of Pali verse, which consists of four lines and is used in making charms. According to Lung Khön and other hsara, katha can be used for evil as well as good purposes. It can also be called atat which Cushing (1914:672) translates as science, skill, a charm, a spell. It might »also be translated as 'magic.' I inquired whether bad spirits are afraid of fire, and Lung Khön answered that the Buddha said that if some- one is sick, he should use pine splints to sweep away the evil spirits. He explained that he could take the tray in either hand and take it in any di- rection from the household. Lung Khön refers to kho as a set of evil spirits and describes them in anthropomorphic terms and invokes the superior spirits and his katha to help him drive kho away. Lung Khön explained that spirits cannot harm hsara because hsara have katha to protect themselves; that the power (kung; Cushing 1914:38 translates this as good or bad quality, attribution; honor) of the hsara is from his katha, Kho attacks rice as well as people. It is called kho khau and to com- bat it people write on pages of paper which they put on stakes in their irri- gated fields. This is called hei kho, to prevent or hinder kho. When I Caun's fourth birthday arrived, her mother asked Lung Khön to change her luck, kyo hsa ta (Cushing 1914:78 translates this as planet; fairy or spirit attached to a person from birth). The objective was to change her luck, but it is not done on every birthday. Lung Khön consulted his books to find an auspicious day for the ceremony. To send away kho, the night before the ceremony I Caun's mother made a tray with the outer layers of a banana trunk and put in it fish, four balls of rice, and three flowers. She placed the tray over the child's head at night and in the morning she took it out and threw it away. The next mor- ning, Lung Khön made an offering (hsawm to) in I Caun's house. He pre- sented sorne flowers at the altar and put them on the altar. Then he held a tray which contained bananas, five rice balls, some sugar and snacks and prayed: Koka tsang, kona kung, Kota ma, Arimiteiya (Kona kung is the second Buddha of this cycle: Kota ma is the Gautama, the most recent Buddha; A rimiteiy a is the next and last Buddha of this cycle) and the khun hsikkya (superior spirits, gods) I respect the Buddha, the teachings (tara), and the order of monks (hsangkha), and tsau möng. The spirit who guards the corner of the house, let all come receive offerings from Nang Caun (I Caun). From this offering let her receive future health, let her escape kho kai (kho</page><page sequence="4">Shan kho 'g of fever). Let her escape the thirty-two kho and the kho of the ninety-six diseases. Let her escape the bad khi that disturbs sleep. Let her not befriend bad people; let her be- friend good people. Let her be well and have good appetite please. This offering is for I Caun. Let it be better than before. Let her be cool (well). Let her be safe, day and night. Hsa thu, hsa thu. People often begin and end prayers with hsa thu. Cushing (1914:220) translates this as a term of approbation, right, well done. People also begin prayers with d ka hsa, which Cushing (1914:700) translates as the asking for leave or permission. He translates akyo as a consequence, result, effect; a good result, advantage, profit (1914:669). Shan use the term in the usual sense of advantage or profit, but also for Buddhist merit. Cushing translates tseitana as good will, kindness, benevolence (185). From the teachings (tara) of the local monks it is clear that tseitana is the state of mind of the doner of an offering. If the doner's mind is clear, without avarice, or anger, or malice, then the offering results in akyo. As Nash (1965:115) says, "It is the act of freely offered giving that positively adds to kutho [merit] that makes the increments of morality into a heap of goodness. ... that can move a person into a better plane of existence." Lung Khön placed the offerings on the altar and prayed again. O ka hsa, o ka hsa, Nang Caun has good tseitana (intentions) and offers food. Let her receive merit (akyo) from these offerings, let Nang Caun receive five kinds of akyo; please let her receive akyo as full as the moon; let her have as much money as a rich man. Let her receive whatever she desires. Let her have enough to eat and enough to offer. Let her have no sadness and let her always feel happy, let her have as much as wisdom as Ma Ha Sa Tu (a man of Solomon-like wisdom of former times). Let her have as much wisdom as men. Let her have everything I have prayed for. Let this little girl receive everything, wisdom as a male. Let her belongings be as prolific as the falling rain; let her keep her belongings like water in a bottomless well; let new belongings come before the old ones are used up. Let her live with the help of the five kinds of akyo, let her receive akyo as full as the full moon. Let all this akyo reach Nang Caun herself. Hsa thu, hsa thu, hsa thu. Lung Khön then chanted a Pali chant. He did not know the meanings of the words but interpreted the chant to mean, "Let me receive complete akyo in this life and the next life, let me know about all good things." He said the chant was Buddhist words so the household would receive good things. Lung Khön returned to Shan and prayed: Let I Caun receive khuso (merit) from the offerings; let her be well and have good appetite, let her escape all dangers and be cool. Let her receive this akyo. Hsa thu, hsa thu. He then poured water into a bowl from a container in his hands. The local monks' teachings reiterated that merit is a consequence of offering. One monk taught that, "When you do good things like this [offering] you can have a long life and the gods and spirits are happy for us and look after us." They teach that the advantages (akyo) of offerings are immediate as well as long-term for future rounds of existence.</page><page sequence="5">20 E. Paul Durrenberger Anthropos 77.1982 It was Mei La's forty-sixth birthday and she wanted to assure her good fortune in the future. Lung Khön informed her that forty-six was not an appropriate birthday on which to make such a ceremony, so they decided to do it for her forty-seventh birthday in site of the fact that she was only forty- six. The purpose of the ceremony, called hsjm to hsak tset, full age offer- ing, is to prevent disease, to make the future auspicious, to prevent calami- ties. It can be done at any time, but a birthday is a good time. Lung Khön went to the house the night before the offering to oversee the preparations and visit. Following a diagram from a printed book Mei La's husband prepared a shallow box with nine compartments arranged in three columns and three rows. Each compartment represented a day except the center one which represented the age of the beneficiary of the offering. Monday Tuesday Wednesday Friday age of beneficiary Wednesday afternoon Sunday Thursday Saturday Each day is associated with a number. If a person was born on the indicated day, the number is the age at which it is good to change his luck. The numbers are: Monday, fifteen; Tuesday, eight; Wednesday, seventeen; Wednesday afternoon, twelve; Thursday, nineteen; Friday, twenty-one; Saturday, ten; Sunday, ten. Mei La and her family prepared betel chews by spreading lime on the pepper leaves, putting betel nut and tobacco inside, and shaping the leaves like birds. The next morning at seven fifteen Lung Khön arrived at Mei La's house and counted balls of rice into the tray that had been prepared the night before. He put fifteen in the compartment for Monday; seventeen in the compartment for Wednesday, etc., and forty-seven in the center compartment. He added pieces of banana, fish, shredded coconut, sugar, and biscuits to each compartment. He tied the twenty bamboo sections that had been prepared as cups the night before and filled with sand, into a bundle. The sand represented the element earth of the four elements: fire, earth, air, and water. He then put paper umbrellas and flags into the cups of sand and tied twelve bamboo cups filled with water into another bundle. These represented the element water. He then put the betel chews shaped as birds into the compartments of the tray and added a flower to the center compartment. He placed the cups on a tray and put the tray on a bed under the altar. He put the box with offerings on a low round eating table below the altar. He put the tray of cups on the altar and prayed: Hsa thu, hsa thu, d ka hsa. Now at this time today, Monday, I, Mei La, have tseitana and support the hsahsana (Buddhism) and offer and repair my merit and the four elements (mei akyo, mei that, mei lum; akyo is merit, that is the four principle elements or an essential quality [Cushing 1914:328], lum is air, wind). Please let her be well. Let tsau wan (the lord of the village) and tsau möng (the lord of the country) help (tswao)her. Let her be cool (well) please.</page><page sequence="6">Shan A/* j 21 Mei La was the only member of the household present in the house. She sat behind Lung Khön with her legs folded under her as women custom- arily sit in the temple. Lung Khön lit four joss sticks and put them in the divided box with the offerings on the altar and lit a candle to place at each side of the box. He found a page in a book and placed it on the table. At first he sat on the floor with his hands joined palms facing each other to his fore- hand, reading between his arms. After the first page, he dropped his arms around his knees. From the Shan book he read: Hsa thu, hsa thu, o ka hsa, o ka hsa, Mei La gives things to offer and respects you with ten fingers like flowers. I respect the Buddha, and the lord tsau who guards the south, tsau H puk ta la and tsau mokalan who guards the north, these two senior monks (ra han ta), respect these lords and the lord of the sun (tsau khun wan); respect the spirit, god who guards the corner of the house and the village. Look after Mei La. Tsau phuk ta (puk tha = a Buddha; Cushing 1914:410) who guards the corner of the village, prevent all dangers. If danger comes from the south, lord of the south, prevent it. Let tsau phei tsa (phei = calamity ; tsa = to put up a barrier) prevent dangers from where the sun goes down. Prevent dangers from the four directions. I have prepared things, and offer to you now, and request this. I offer white rice, flowers, paper flowers, I offer (lu tan) everything. I request help from the elements (that; Lung Khön later explained this was the lord of the earth); the water; all the twelve kinds of elements help me. I am generous (have tseitana) and offer so the elements will help me. I also offer offerings to the element of fire to help me. I offer, so let fire, earth, air, and water, the seven elements help me. I, Mei La, offer nine kinds of attributes (kung; Cushing 1914:38 translates this as attribute or honor; informants said they were thankfulness to the Buddha, to the Buddhist teaching, the monks, to parents, teachers, the lord of the country, the lord of the village, and the lord of this particular area). Let me escape all enemies. Let me, Mei La, be well and escape the hundred thousand kinds of enemies. Also let me escape the enemies of fire and water; let me escape spirit enemies, human enemies, disease enemies. Let me escape the twenty-five kinds of enemies and the thirty-two kinds of miseries, the seventeen kinds of bad feelings, and the ten types of punishments. Let me escape them totally. I offer now. Let the power of the offerings help me. Let me have premonitions of bad things in the future (informants said this meant, for instance, to be warned of danger through dreams). Let me escape the ninety-six diseases. Let all the bad things flee, run away from me. Let me escape headaches, body stiffness, all. Let me escape the spirits which make people sick; let them go far away. Let the khy that happen every day, every year, every minute go away. Let me have luck (kyo It; Cushing 1914:78 translates this as planet, a fairy or spirit attached to a person from birth). Let no bad things stay near me. From this time, let me be cool (well); let me have a good appetite and own many belongings. I request these of the Buddha. Let me receive everything I want; let everyone have affection (mit ta) for me. Let people have affection for me wherever I go. Let people treat me well wherever I go. Let my good luck (khyak; Cushing 1914:140 translates this as time or subject) be as a spring that never goes dry. Let my buffalos, cows, and belongings increase. Let me be powerful (tan kho). Let what I wish come to pass; let all my wishes be granted quickly. In the spirit country, the human country, let me receive what I wish quickly. From now, let me be well every day, every night, every morning. Let me have the five kinds of khuso (Burmese, merit; Lung Khön did not know the five kinds of merit). Let me be cool when I sleep, when I walk, when I eat. Let me be born when the Arimiteiya comes (the next Buddha) so I can see him. Let me become a pupil of the Buddha. Let me escape all bad spirits and become a disciple of the Buddha. After my birth, now, do not let me stay in the human realm again, let me get nirvana. Hsa thu, hsa thu, hsa thu.</page><page sequence="7">22 E- Paul Durrenberger Anthropos 77.1982 He continued reading: I, Mei La, made the offerings to the Buddha and support hsahsana (Buddhism). Now let me respect the five kung (informants said these were parents, teacher, the Buddha, the Buddhist teachings, the monks). Let me, Mei La, be well. Let me escape all miseries, diseases, and dangers. I respect and offer not only for the Buddha but also for the three sacred texts (pitakat). Let me respect the nine and the five kung (attributes). Let all the monks support me so I do not fall down. Hsa thu, hsa thu. Let me, Mei La, receive this. Let me, Mei La, escape all bad things. I offer and ask for help from the Buddha. I request this of the three gems, the Buddha, the Buddhist teachings, and the order of monks. I also request it from the tsati (cedis, pagodas) and the holy texts. I re- quest it from the relics of the Buddha, teeth, jaws, fingers, skull, all the relics. Let me re- ceive merit (khuso) in the next life as I receive rice next year from planting rice this year. Let all the people have affection for me when I go to other places or sleep at other places. Let all my wishes be granted quickly. Let me enter nirvana to wait until Arimiteiya appears. Do not let me stay in the human realm. Hsa thu, hsa thu. It was now seven fifty-five and Lung Khön told Mei La to pour water, yat nam, and she poured water from a bottle with a flower in it into a bowl as he read from the book again: J ka hsa, d ka hsa. I, Mei La, have water in the diamond pot, silver pot, gold pot. I have water to give to every life form, from the small insects to the elephants. I also give this water to all my relatives who have died, to all the eighty thousand-five hundred life forms at every place. I share it with all of these and the sixteen big countries, and the three hundred thousand palaces, and the heavenly bodies, the sun, the wind, the rain, the lord of the moon, and everyone in the whole world, and with all relatives who have died and reached bad places (ti an am li) to make them well, with all spirits, mountain spirit, lord of the country, lord of the forest, to the superior spirits who guard the holy scriptu- res and Buddhism, with the evil spirit of the Himalayan forests; with the six places of the spirit country and the twenty celestial countries (möng htsang) ; with the human country and hell (nga rai), and with the infants yet unborn; with the earth and the ten thousand kinds of animals; with the people in the round of human existence; and with the spirit who stays at my right and left shoulder. I, Mei La, have offered, so, please, let it be recorded that I made this offering. Share it with the handicapped. Let the superior spirits (hsikkya) write my name in golden books, that I have done this good act. Let me meet the next Buddha who will stay beneath the bo tree. Do not forget that I have made merit (khuso) now and let me receive as much merit then as I receive now. Let me go to nirvana (nik pan). Hsa thu, hsa thu. In a different context, teaching at the temple after a presentation of offerings, one monk listed the advantages or benefits of offering: After the people offer robes in the time of kathing all of the people and khun phi khun hsikkya (superior spirits) are happy for the people who make the offerings. Spirits congratulate them the same as people do. Superior spirits are very happy to hear it and they bless the people. This is one of the akyo of love. And the superior spirits of the spirit land, when they see people offering, are happy and list them in the golden books. ... The superior spirits write down the names and the time in the golden books and are very happy themselves. The ideas expressed in the teaching are identical to the ones expressed in the prayer. Lung Khön, having finished reading, bowed to the altar and prayed in his ordinary voice :</page><page sequence="8">Shan kho 23 J ka hsa, o ka hsa, please, let me pray to the Buddha, to the one with superior power (hpun). Let me escape from the muddy place to the dry place (from bad to good). Let me escape all dangers that happen in the human country during the next five thousand years (ie., let me see the next Buddha). Hsa thu, hsa thu, o ka hsa, o ka hsa. Now Lung Khön chanted in Pali. He did not know the meaning of the words but interpreted them to be words of respect for the Buddha. He said the chant meant, "Let me receive merit from the Buddha." He then prayed again. Thank to the teachings, the order of monks, the Buddha, parents, lord of the country, tsau pa peng, tsau pao lin (lord of the forest), tsao paii lin (lord who guards the earth), tsau hsamathi (lord of good feelings) who guards the corner of the house, and the superior spirits (teiwa), the lords of the wind and the rain, the spirits of heavenly bodies, the spirits who watch us (ko tsang nat tsang), the spirit who guards the four corners of the country, the spirit who guards the five thousand years of the Buddhist era. Let all of these spirits watch over me and take care of me. Let me be well and happy. Let me escape all kho, kho of spirits (phi), kho am li (bad khao), hot kho, kho of fever, kho of witchcraft (kho phü), all kho. Let me escape the ninety-six types of disease; let me befriend good people; do not let me make bad friends. Let all the spirits watch over me and guard me, support me, please. Let me live in the human realm, so people and spirits will have affection for me. Let other people believe whatever I say. When I go in front of high people (khun, lords) let me make a good impression, please. Let all who read and listen to the readings and make offerings receive merit (akyo khuso). Hsa thu, hsa thu. Mei La took two packets of rice, bananas, and biscuits wrapped in leaves and put one on the verandah railing and one on the village bridge with one joss stick in each. Lung Khön explained this was to support the four elements of fire, earth, air, and water, and to make the beneficiary feel well. Lung Khön explained that if one does not pour water after an offering, it is not finished, it is not a real offering until the water is poured. This is true of any offering to the Buddha or the monks. In this one ceremony we have evidence of all three reasons for the efficacy of Buddhist magic which Spiro (1970:89-151) discusses and more: the prayers appeal directly to the power of the Buddha, his relics, the four elements (as though they were superhuman powers), the power of the offer- ings themselves, the spirits, and seek to improve Mei La's merit. Clearly, the intent is, in part, to affect an "immediate change in [her] karmic balance" (Spiro 1970:151) by virtue of the offerings. Nash (1965:136) discusses Burmese rituals to affect instantaneous merit. The offerings are to have long term karmic influence as well as confer direct advantage. Another way to change one's immediate fortunes is to invite the old people of the village to give their blessings and tie strings on the beneficiary's hands, mat mü. O Ta invited Lung Khön, Lung Mei, Paw Taw Thi, Mae Taw La, and several other elders to his house to bless him. When they arrived, he served them packaged cakes and iced sweet drinks. At this time, in December, ice was very prized in the village. Mae Taw La told the story of a divorce in the village. Others offered brief comments or asked questions, but it was mostly her monologue. Then O Ta explained why he had asked the elders to bless him.</page><page sequence="9">24 E. Paul Durrenberger Anthropos 77.1982 A week or two ago while O Ta was asleep he was afraid of something and startled. Something moved and someone called his name with a loud shout. He was afraid. Now he cannot sleep, has bad dreams, things press against him. He consulted a hsara who checked him and told him that now it is an unlucky time for him, that not long ago he had been frightened in the eastern part of the forest which caused the bad luck which in turn is the cause of his sleeplessness and fright. O Ta thought about it. The hsara said the old people of the village should tie strings: that O Ta should feed them and pay respect {kan to) to them and that they should give him blessings, mang ka la. He thought the hsara was correct. He remembered two months ago he went into the forest just after the Chinese smugglers had fought each other at Tomato Valley. After the battle he and two friends had gone there. They got separated, so he went on alone. He saw an arm in the ground and two feet protruding from the ground. He was frightened. He thought they had fought at Tomato Valley. He had heard that a man was shot but had not died; that his companions carried him away and he died on the way, so they buried him by the path. He went to a village and not far from the road he saw a bloody Chinese who had been shot dead. He was afraid, so he thought this was the cause of his troubles. When he started to build his new house, his problems started. If he sleeps in the dark, without a lighted lamp, he is afraid, but he does not know what he fears; his heart races. When he eats and someone calls him, he is afraid. He went to town and when he was eating he felt his heart racing and was afraid. He went to the hospital, stopping only to buy cigarettes. There he got an injection and medicine and came home, but it happened again. Then he went to the hsara who explained the problem and said he needed the old people to bless him, to tie his hands, to tie his soul. O Ta took a red lacquer bowl with lengths of string inside it and held it above his head and presented it to the old people. Lung Khön took a string and said a katha over it, and blew on it. O Ta held out his right hand; his left hand grasped his right elbow. Lung Khön stroked the string outward away from O Ta 's body to take out kho and said, "Let all kho leave him," broke off the end of the string, and put it be- tween the floor boards, and spat after it to drive away kho. He then stroked the string towards O Ta 's body and said, "Let him have long life, health, good sleep, good appetite," and tied the string on O Ta's right wrist, broke the string, and O Ta extended his left hand while he grasped his left elbow with his right hand. Lung Khön tied the string on O Ta's left hand with a prayer for good fortune, but without repeating the kho driving, broke off the excess string, and returned it to the bowl. The other old people did the same one by one. When they had finished, O Ta held the bowl to his fore- head and asked for their blessing. Each elder said his own blessing, wishing him health, fortune, good sleep, good appetite, and long life. After the blessings, kwam mang ka la, O Ta served more cakes and drink, and at nine- fifteen the elders left his house.</page><page sequence="10">Shan khi 25 At the end of Lent (ok wa) and at the new year in the fifth month (April) people present small offerings (tana) to old people and receive their blessing (mang ka la). This is called kan to. Monks also say blessings (kuam mang ka la) at the end of their teachings. When people present offerings or gifts to others, they receive blessing in return. Monks not only elaborate on the ideology of merit by explaining the mechanics of merit and illustrating it with stories, they also give blessings. When people make offerings to spirits, such as the valley spirits, tsau möng, etc. they ask for specific benefits such as protection from evil spirits, good rice harvests, wealth, but they do not ask for or receive blessings. The spirits can directly aid in the attainment of mundane goals, but cannot improve the power of the person making the offering. People do not mention tseitana when they offer to spirits, but do mention it in offerings to the Buddha, the relics, etc. Offerings with specif- ic mundane goals are not motivated by tseitana. Offerings motivated by tseitana, as the monks repeatedly teach, do result in khuso, merit, strength- ening the doner. This in turn has immediate mundane advantages, akyo. Thus when villagers maintain that things of spirits and things of Buddhism are entirely different realms, that Buddhist activities have to do with merit and actions relating to spirits do not, they indicate the difference. Propitiation of spirits has no affect on the person's merit, hence, on his power. Kho is not a spirit proper. People do not make offerings to it to placate it, do not propitiate it as they do spirits such as the lord of the country, tsau möng, or the spirits of the swiddens and valleys. Kho is misfortune per- sonified, whatever its cause- witchcraft, fever, a cold, disease, etc. When kho strikes, people send it away; to prevent it's evil effects people attempt to improve their khuso, Buddhist merit, or get blessings; they do something to improve their own power. It is obvious from the cases I have described that people can improve their merit by other means than the usual ones of charity and morality. They can make offerings with no economic value and with no recipient to strengthen their khuso. It is also obvious that people consider the advantages (akyo) of their improved merit to be immediate in this life and not only for the next life. One of the advantages is protection against kho. The advantages of merit are immediate, however, it is acquired. There is a sense in which this is the use of Buddhist power to protect against evil, but the means of improving merit are not the classic Buddhist means. The hsara protects himself with his katha but this may not be the use of Buddhist power per se. It may simply be the use of a spell, as Lahu and Lisu use them without any necessary connection to the fact that the spell is originally a stanza of a Buddhist text.</page><page sequence="11">26 E.
