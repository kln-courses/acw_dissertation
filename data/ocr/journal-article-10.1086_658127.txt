Aleni retained Ricci’s policy of  adapting to Confucianism as a method of  catechistic pedagogy. However, he moved the focus of  the mission geographically from the capital, Beijing, to southern Fujian, and demographically from ruling court elites to local literati and commoners. At the peak of  his proselytization endeavor, he selectively reproduced in Chinese Geronimo Nadal’s illustrated book Evangelicae Historiae Imagines (Antwerp, 1593; hereafter cited as EHI ), under the new title Tianzhu Jiangsheng Chuxiang Jingjie           ( E  x  p l a  nations on the Incarnation of  the Heav- enly Lord), published in Fuzhou in 1637 (hereafter cited as Jingjie). This essay attempts to illuminate the Jingjie’s impact as a vehicle to conduct the Jesuits’ strategy of  adapting to and ultimately complement- ing Confucianism, not only in verbal discourse but also in visual imag- ery. I am arguing that the Jingjie attempted to promote the Jesuits’ association with Confucianism by fully exploiting the supernatural mo- tifs in the visual narrative of  the Vita Christi, which compared to and even surpassed similar motifs in the Illustrated Life of Confucius (Shengjitu    ,  l i t erally, Images of the Sage’s Traces). The Shengjitu  emerged and evolved through the period when Confucius’s cultic icons ç 2011 by The University of  Chicago.

I believe that the elements of  the supernatural such as mir- acle, exorcism, and resuscitation that appear far more overtly in the Jingjie than in the Shengjitu served as a comparative link to adapt the former to the latter, but eventually rendered the former more persuasive for the Chinese audience and aided the Jesuit mission project. Contributing to the illustrated book’s persuasiveness was that, while Confucian literati have traditionally disparaged the supernatural as superstitious, they have also paradoxically been deeply interested in it for the very scarcity of such a dimension in their own teaching.1 For the purpose of  my argument, I will discuss the Jingjie as an amply illustrated narrative, even though its composition of  images and alphabet- ically arranged captions preserve the EHI’s original objective of  topo- graphic visualization, which was devised and deployed actively by the Jesuits in the Catholic Reformation in Europe.2 I will first review the Jesuits’ method of  accommodating Christianity to Confucianism and question whether this policy could be equally applied to the introduction and deployment of  Christian art in the Chinese mission project.3 Then, I will examine the emergence and formation of  the supernatural elements in the Shengjitu, which appear to have been related to the increasing criti- cisms of  Confucius’s divinity-like cultic icons and their removal. Two su- 1 Contrary to traditional assumptions, Confucianism does have a range of  religious ele- ments, which I will discuss in due course. However, its religious or quasi-religious aspects are not equivalent to those of  Christianity or Buddhism.

As in theological adaptation, the Jesuits could exploit these ana- logical scenes as the foundation of  visual adaptation and eventually further advance their Christian imagery as the perfection of  Confucianism. Thereafter, I will continue to discuss the supernatural motifs in the Jingjie, which exceed their counterparts in the Shengjitu in thematic variety and dramatic impact. Interestingly, these scenes resonate very closely with the miraculous incidents experienced by the Fujian Chris- tian community, which were recorded by Li Jiugong    ,  Aleni’s lit- eratus convert and avid supporter, in the second volume of  Lixiu Yijian      (  M   i r  r o  r   o  f   e   xhortation to cultivation), ca. 1645 (hereafter cited as Yijian). In the last two sections, I will analyze the supernatural scenes in the Jingjie and their verbal amplifications in Jesuit literature, and finally I will relate them to the comparable stories of  Li Jiugong in my translations. I argue that the supernatural motifs in the Jingjie made a connection to the Confucian narrative of  the Shengjitu with their similar auspicious mo- tifs but eventually overpowered the latter with far more appealing and re- ward-promising imagery. I believe that the Jesuit mission project in China, not by merely underscoring its affinity to the intellectual discourse of  Con- fucianism but by boldly proposing its supernatural dimension, could pene- trate into the hearts of  both uneducated commoners and Confucian literati. Aleni’s Chinese adaptation of  the EHI appears to have served this strategy. i. the jesuit adaptation to confucianism and the question  of visual culture The Jesuits’ policy of  accommodating Confucianism while antagonizing Buddhism was a rather contradictory policy, since Catholicism shared with Buddhism a number of  common areas such as afterlife explanation, super- natural mysteries, and the visual culture of  icon and narrative both for cultic and meditative practices.4 Except for the continuous amplification and production of  the Shengjitu over the centuries, Confucianism did not develop a visual culture that achieved the level of  the visual cultures of            Buddhism and Christianity, and even its institution of  an iconic cult was 4 Jacques Gernet, China and the Christian Impact: A Conflict of Cultures (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), 77, 87; Cunfu Chen, “Trying to Assess Aleni’s Mission: Success or Failure?” [in English] in Studies in Religion and Culture              (Beijing: Xinhua Shudian Jingxiao, 1995), 435–36; Zürcher, “Confucian and Christian Reli- giosity,” 649–50; Shin, “The Reception of  EHI,” 314–33. Even though Daoism also had a long history of  using anthropomorphic icons and concerned the spiritual realm more than Confucianism did, Ricci did not pay equal attention to it probably because Daoism’s establish- ments among the populace were not comparable to those of  Buddhism.

Nonetheless, the Jesuits chose Confucianism as their partner of  mutual acculturation, primarily because of  the dearth of  religious dimension in the latter. They deemed Confucianism as basically an ethical and political discourse, and thus not an obstacle to be antagonized.5 Both Ricci and Aleni successfully took advantage of  insufficient Con- fucian explications of  Tian    (Heaven) and Tianming    (  H  e a  v e n  l y       Mandate) and interpreted them anew as the allusion to the personified Christian God, whom Chinese ancient sages had already recognized but not fully understood.6 However, such an analogical method could not be applied to the core of  Christian theology, that is, the Christological issues of  the Incarnation and Passion.7 As the Christian arts of  icon and narrative mainly concern Christology rather than cosmology, they could not be properly put to use to connect to Confucianism; their iconography and function were much more similar to those of  Buddhism, which the Jesuits criticized as a false religion.8 The famous case of  iconographic confusion or conflation between the Virgin Mary and Son-bringing Avalokite¶vara in contemporary China illustrates this irony most pointedly.9 Therefore, when Aleni introduced a magnificently illustrated Vita Christi in a Chinese version, he was attempting to go beyond Ricci’s achievement: introducing the Chinese to the message of  the person of 5 Lionel Jensen, Manufacturing Confucianism: Chinese Traditions and Universal Civiliza- tion (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1997), 63–70, 129; Deborah Sommer, “Destroying Confucius: Iconoclasm in the Confucian Temple,” in Wilson, On Sacred Grounds, 125–26. 6 Jinshui Lin    ,  “Tentative Discussions on G.

He began by pointing out comparable elements between two ideas but eventually proposed that the Christian motifs were superior.11 In light of  this, the analogical starting point for introducing Christological imagery must have been nothing other than the Shengjitu, the illustrated life of  Con- fucius, which had already been widely circulating since the mid-fifteenth century. Confucius was the protagonist of  Confucianism, to which the Jesuits were directing their best efforts of  accommodation policy. Thus he was a perfect analogical counterpart to Christ, protagonist in the Chris- tian discourse and imagery of  human salvation. Even though the original methodology of  topographic visualization in the EHI resembles that of Pure Land Buddhist art and practice,12 certainly Aleni’s conscious inten- tion was not to explore such a connection to Buddhist tradition but to present an illustrated Vita Christi comparable to the Vita Confucii, and eventually to overpower the latter with the more appealing message of human salvation. In this enterprise of  visual adaptation, the linkage to Confucian imagery and the ultimate persuasion would lie in the motifs of  the super- natural so prominently illustrated in the Jingjie. Yet the supernatural, such as miracles, mysteries, and ghostly beings, has been disregarded and even despised in Confucianism as superstitious, misleading ele- ments. Confucius himself  had proscribed discussing “monstrous things, [physical] force, chaos, and ghosts \]^_”   (Lunyu    , Shu’er chapter [` ). The sage also urged to “respect ghosts, but stay away from them ab_`c*”  (Yong’ye chapter def) . When he was questioned about ghosts and death, he answered rather disapprovingly that “when one can’t [properly] serve men, how can he serve ghosts? ghijklhi b . . . when one does not know life, how can he know death? gmnkl mo ” (Xianjin chapter pqf)  .  Even though Confucianism has its own religious dimensions such as a cosmology, explanation of  the soul (hun r)  ,  a  n  d    e  v  e  n    b  eneficiary prayer, they are more likely metaphysical and ritualistic discussions.13 In order to bring forth boons or prevent harms, the prayers were to be addressed 10 Criveller, Preaching Christ, chap. 18; In the post-Ricci era, the Jesuits changed their policy and became explicitly religious in their mission endeavor and discourses.

Even in the case of  fending off  disease or calamity, direct contact with and expulsion of  an evil force are hardly found in Confucianism. This is also achieved by conducting sacrificial offerings to Heaven, according to the strictly regulated ritualistic procedure sanctioned by ancient tradition.14 It is relatively true that Confucianism is more concerned with the culti- vation of  individuals and their responsibility to serve the state for the common good that is acceptable under hierarchical society. In contrast to the earthly concern and orientation of  Confucianism,15 Christianity as a religion has a full array of  mysteries, among which the Incarnation and Passion of  Christ for human redemption are primary. Buddhism, though detested and purposefully antagonized by the Jesuits, also has such supernatural elements, not unlike those in Christianity. How- ever, Buddhism could successfully take root in post-Tang Confucianist China, since it did not attempt to overrule Confucianism but rather to fill in the latter’s gap, its lack or insufficient explanation of  issues such as the afterlife, miracles, exorcism, and so forth. On the other hand, the Jesuits’ method of  complementing Confucianism aimed not merely to coexist, but eventually to consummate the latter and become “the orthodox,” as Erik Zürcher termed it.16 Even though the Jesuits wanted to distinguish their religion from Bud- dhism, they had to bring in supernatural elements, not unlike those of  Bud- dhism, in order to convey the message of  Christology. In a strict sense, Christology concerns the Incarnation, and by extension Christ’s Passion that had to be accomplished through it.17 However, I believe that the whole process of  the Incarnation, Passion, and Resurrection in the life of  Christ laid the foundation and justification for all those supernatural elements in- corporated into the religion of  Christianity. Ricci successfully connected to the intellectual discourse of  Confucianism with Christian cosmology.18 14 Sommer, “Sacrificial Offerings,” chap. 4. 15 The mysteries and supernatural in Christianity also catered to the earthly concerns of the populace in medieval and early modern Europe. However, Confucian literati believed that earthly matters could better be handled by the earthly means and institutions. 16 Zürcher, “Confucian and Christian Religiosity,” 615–25; Zhang Xianqing also notes the same problem, Zhang Xianqing up),  “Tentative Discussions on G.

Therefore, when Aleni introduced the EHI in its Chinese version two years after the publication of  its verbal counterpart Tianzhu Jiangsheng Yanxing Jilüe  Bn   ( E s s e n t i a ls  of  the Heavenly Lord’s Incarnation, Words, and Acts; hereafter cited as Jilüe), a loose equal to Adnotationes and Meditationes in Evangelia (Antwerp, 1595; hereafter AME ), he was virtually bringing in the supernatural of  Christianity to Confucian literati. These literati were educated to detest such elements but already had a para- doxical history of  accepting and even exploring them through Buddhism and Daoism as well as in their own metaphysical theories. It is well known that Confucian literati in the late Ming period actively participated in the Buddhist reform movement and also conducted its de- votional practices for personal afterlife salvation.19 Puzzling as it must have been to European missionaries with a dominantly Christian culture, Chinese intellectuals exploited both Confucianism and Buddhism as two different conduits for social, ideological activities on the one hand, and personal, religious lives on the other hand. Thus, both educated and un- educated Chinese were indeed in need of  the supernatural realm, which Confucianism could not fully provide. With his profound, first-hand under- standing of  Chinese religious culture and Confucianism, Aleni must have been keenly aware that the persuasion of  the supernatural was eventually inevitable, if  Christianity was to fully take root in Chinese soil. And he must have known, from the case of  Buddhism, that it was more than possible. In support of  my thesis is an interesting and rather unusual work, the aforementioned Yijian compiled by Li Jiugong. He was a younger brother of  Li Jiubiao    ,  who authored the Kouduo Richao  (  D    a  i l  y record of  oral exhortations), daily records of  Aleni’s catechistic discussions with local converts and literati between 1630 and 1640. The Li brothers were from a prominent local family and literati fully educated in the Con- fucian classics. After their conversion to Catholicism, they served as avid literati and commoners, exorcism was a topic Ricci dealt with not infrequently. However, I believe that his dealing with the supernatural was rather secondary to his primary effort at intellectual adaptation.

These major works of  Aleni con- centrated, following in Ricci’s footsteps, on the rational and logical in- terpretations of  Christian theology as the extension or fulfillment of Confucian metaphysics and ethics. However, the second volume of  the Yijian contains a wealth of  super- natural stories drawn from European hagiographies and, significantly, also amply from the mysterious incidents experienced by local Chinese Christians in Fujian.21 Their storylines and patterns are quite similar to the traditional Chinese legends and folktales, but here the solution of hardship comes from the Christian God rather than Buddhist or Daoist deities. In these stories, God’s power usually intervenes through holy ob- jects or lay believers’ fervent prayers. Most important is the fact that these incidents are often experienced or witnessed by literati converts like Li Jiugong, not by uneducated commoner Christians. This fascination with or at least acknowledgment of  the supernatural among literati converts appears to illustrate how the supernatural, even paranormal devotional practices of  Buddhism could have coexisted with Confucianism in China, appealing not only to commoners but also to literati. If  so, the same pos- sibility lay for Christianity. The educated also had fear of  the unknown, supernatural power, from which their learning of  Confucianism did not offer much protection. Surprisingly, supernatural motifs are not totally unseen in the illustrated life of  Confucius himself, who taught not to concern “monstrous things,            [physical] force, chaos, and ghosts.” After all, Confucianism had a certain degree of  tolerance or even need for the supernatural.22 Since Aleni’s in- troduction of  the EHI was supposed to provide a competing counterpart and eventually a complement to the Shengjitu, these common supernatural elements in the Jingjie and the Shengjitu, though not entirely identical in theme and quantity, could serve as the starting point of  analogical accul- turation. Once this link was established, the Jesuits could further build on it by amplifiying the mysteries of  the life of  Christ, which could be far 20 Wu Weiwei   , “Three Pillars in Fujian Catholic Mission” vw B  X &lt;  , C atholic Church in China ? B   (2008/1): 41; also for Aleni’s relation and con- tact with other local literati in Fujian, see Lin Jinshui     , “Giulio Aleni and the Late Ming Fujian Society”     (GvW78,  S tudies in Marine Exchange 3/#$  2   ( 1   992): 59–62. 21 The Yijian included some excerpts from the Daily Record of Oral Exhortations as well, but these are not narrating supernatural incidents. 22 Sommer, “Sacrificial Offerings,” 111ff. </page> <page sequence="9"> History of Religions 337 more persuasive and appealing to the Chinese audience. In this process, Aleni was to move the Jesuits’ adaptation method beyond Ricci’s achieve- ments in two aspects. First, he could bring in the Christological messages, supernatural in themselves, to the Chinese, who were already familiarized with the cosmological concept of  the Heavenly Lord through the rational and logical discourses of  Ricci. Second, Aleni would extend the adapta- tion method, already proven to be effective in the verbal discourses, to the visual sphere, in which his targeted Confucianism had already brought in paranormal, supernatural elements for some time by that point. The visual culture of  Christianity, very much like that of  Bud- dhism, had been deeply associated with supernatural experiences such as vision and miracle working and therefore could connect to the Confu- cian motifs of  the supernatural. Aleni must have seen through the fact that the Chinese, both educated and uneducated, were strongly attracted by the supernatural efficacy of Christianity. This was how Buddhism and Daoism were not merely tol- erated but were firmly established in the Confucian empire of  China. Already in the days of  Matteo Ricci, the Jesuits had frequently conducted boon prayers and exorcisms at the requests of  the Chinese literati, though these were much less dramatic than those practiced in Aleni’s circle.23 The primary focus of  mission for both Ricci and Aleni has always been directed to theological and intellectual discussions, but both fully under- stood the persuasion of  the supernatural and actively exploited that dimen- sion to their best advantage. Furthermore, Aleni himself  appears seven times in the miracle stories of  the Yijian. Even Aleni’s colleague missionaries Ferreira, Rudomina, and Canevari appear at least once in them. Since the book Yijian was com- piled by Li Jiugong between 1635 and 1639, and one story I translate below bears the year of  1627, these stories reflect the experience and spirituality of  local Chinese Christians around the time when the Jingjie was prepared and finally published in 1637.24 The participation of  Aleni and his Europeans colleagues in these stories, I believe, attests to the fact that such dealings with the supernatural were not merely superstitious reactions on the part of  Chinese converts, but indeed were a substantial part of  the Jesuits’ authorized mission activities. Aleni simply did not want to discuss this dimension in his catechistic writings, since his and 23 Zhang, “About God, Demons, and Miracles,” 12–15. As I will discuss again in the third section of  this essay, Ricci’s exorcism was quite similar to Confucian prayer to heaven, sharply contrasted with the direct confrontation with the evil force recorded in Li Jiugong’s Y  i j i a  n .            24 Erik Zürcher, “The Lord of  Heaven and the Demons: Strange Stories from a Late Ming Christian Manuscript,” in Religion und Philosophie in Ostasien: Festschrift für Hans Stein- inger zum 65; Geburtstag, ed.

I believe that the visual revelation of  the supernatural was certainly one of  the features that contributed to the continuous printing and circulation of the Jingjie up to the nineteenth century.25 Just as the supernatural iconog- raphies of  Buddhism and Daoism have always been popular in Chinese religious culture, the like themes in the Christian version were no less successful. However, the continuous printing of  the Jingjie does not mean that Catholicism was established in China. As Aleni’s mission in Fujian was literally dismantled with the fall of  the Ming dynasty,26 the imagery of  the Christian supernatural in the Jingjie survived not as an agent of  its religious authority and institution, but more likely as a cultural novelty, as the rest of  European material objects introduced by the Jesuits remained as such throughout the following Qing dynasty. ii. heavenly sanction in the life of confucius and  confucianist iconoclasm Confucianism, albeit concerning itself  more with this-worldly matters, came to entail quasi-religious rituals as it was instated as the imperial ideology.27 From the Tang dynasty, Confucius has been venerated in the nationwide network of  temples, and his anthropomorphic statues were set up as the recipients of  sacrificial rite. The use of  icons therein came to in- voke criticisms largely on two grounds. One pointed out the rationale of the icon’s relevance in the rite. The other criticized the foreign origin of the iconic cult associated with Buddhism. The former has aspects both similar to and different from the iconophobism of  the European Reforma- tion, with which the Jesuits were thoroughly familiar.28 The first opposition, though phrased differently over the periods by dif- ferent opponents, basically lies in that the physical, material icon of  Con- fucius contains and delimits the true existence of  his soul or ghost, who 25 Joseph Dehergne, SJ, “Une vie illustrée de Notre-Seigneur au temps des Ming,” Nou- velle Revue de Science Missionaire 14 (1958): 113; M.

The situation being what it is, they would have to creep and crawl to get them.”29 At first reading, this criti- cism appears merely to point out the logical inconsistency between the posture of  the icon and its supposed function in the rite. However, the underlying logic does not differ greatly from the European or even Byz- antine cases of  iconophobism. By making an icon, spiritual and thus unconfined existence is delimited and circumscribed by the material.30 A similar line of  criticisms continued to surface up to the late Ming period that repeatedly underscored, that the invisibility and unlimitedness of  spirit were violated by the use of  material icons. Most significant for my thesis is the iconophobic criticism of  Qiu Jun  ( 1 421–1495) in the late Ming dynasty. In his Daxue Yanyibu 45  ( S upplement to the extended meaning of  the great learning), written in 1487, which was widely read and influential even in Korea and Japan, Qiu proposed basically the same line of  argument that material icons impede the correct understanding of  the nonmaterial, spiritual exis- tence, for which an icon is a mere visual reference.31 Thus he opposed the installment of  Confucius’s icon in his temple attached to the Imperial University in Beijing. Qiu’s argument is important because it was eventu- ally adopted by Emperor Jiajing  (r. 1521–1566), who in 1530 ordered the removal of  Confucius’s icons from his temples nationwide, except for the one in the sage’s native town of  Qufu  .3 2             29 Translated and quoted by Sommer in her “Destroying Confucius,” 106–7. 30 For the Byzantine theory of  iconophobism, see Ambrosios Giakalis, Images of the Divine: The Theology of Icons at the Seventh Ecumenical Council (Leiden: Brill, 1994), esp. 7ff. and 25–26. For the period of  the Reformation, see especially Andreas Karlstadt’s vehe- ment criticisms on icon in “On the Removal of  Images,” in A Reformation Debate: Three Treatises in Translation, trans. and ed. Bryan Mangrum and Giuseppe Scavizzi (Toronto: Center for Reformation and Renaissance Studies, 1998), 26–28. 31 Sommer, “Destroying Confucius,” 121. 32 In this light, it is very significant that Giulio Aleni later not only acknowledged the rite to Confucius as a respectful practice but also did not criticize the use of  icons therein, since he deemed the rite and icon (more likely portrait) as nonreligious institutions.

Anthropomorphic icons were not used in the ancient golden days of  the Zhou dynasty, and thus were not sanctioned by Confucian tradition. Their use is a foreign practice introduced into China with the advent of Buddhism, in which delusive and threatening images serve to allure people into its religious belief.33 This criticism of  the foreign origin of icons associated with Buddhism is not merely a xenophobic or nation- alistic argument, I think, but it also questions whether the iconic venera- tion conforms to Confucian teaching. Significantly, these opponents to Confucius’s icons did not direct the same attack on the Buddhist use of icon.34 Buddhism had developed the use of  anthropomorphic images first for commemorative but eventually cultic purposes long before its entry into China, the process of  which was closely associated with indigenous Hinduism and the foreign impact of  Hellenism.35 Therefore, anthropomorphic icons are problematic and improper only in Confucianism. I think this line of  criticisms was asserting that Confucius himself  was, unlike Buddha or Daoist immortals, a human being, and that his proscription of  “monstrous things, [physical] force, chaos, and ghosts” contradicted the divine, religious sensation emitted by the cultic use of icons.36 It appears that Confucian literati could not allow the supernatural aura of  icons to intrude upon their orthodox teaching. To the best of  my knowledge, I have never come across the Jesuits’ mentioning of  Confu- cianist iconoclasm. However, the Jesuits were actively accommodating Confucianism; thus they must have paid close attention to the controver- sial issue of  the iconic cult in its rituals. The prohibition of  Confucius’s icons was enacted nationwide only about thirty years before the Jesuits’ entry into China. Though the Jesuits made a strong effort to differentiate their religion from Buddhism, they eventually had to persuade the Con- fucian literati to acknowledge that the religious, mysterious, and even su- pernatural elements of  Christianity were not unlike those of  Buddhism, among which the veneration of  icons and their spiritual force were not to be excluded. The first removal of  Confucius’s icon from his temple took place in 1382 at the Imperial University in Nanjing,37 but removal was eventually executed throughout the whole empire in 1530, except for the icon in the sage’s native town of  Qufu. Returning to the pre-Buddhist tradition, 33 Sommer, “Destroying Confucius,” 118. 34 Ibid., 105–6. 35 Benjamin Rowland, The Art and Architecture of India: Buddhist, Hindu, Jain (New York: Penguin, 1977), 59  ff  .                       36 For the use of  images in Daoism, see Stephen Little, “Taoism and the Arts of  China,” in Taoism and the Arts of China, ed.

After this Confucianist version of  iconoclasm, the visual culture of  Confucianism was largely replaced by sequential narrative images of  the sage’s life. The situation was comparable to that of  the contemporary Europe, where less radical reformers acknowledged and even encouraged the use of  narrative images for pedagogic purposes. The first version of  the illustrated Vita Confucii or Shengjitu was col- lated and published in 1444 under the direction of  imperial censor Zhang Kai }¬.   T  h is version was very factual and rational, devoid of  any supernatural incidents except for Confucius moaning over a hunted Qilin, an auspicious creature. Its killing was an ill omen for the following chaotic era. The version that concerns my thesis and continued to be reproduced in various formats in the following centuries is the expanded thirty-nine- scene Shengjitu prepared by He Tingrui ­® ̄,    p r e  f e c  t  of  Hengzhou.38 This version of  the Shengjitu was published posthumously in 1497, ten years after the publication of  Qiu Jun’s influential criticism on the sage’s cultic icon. The original did not survive, but its scenes continued to be reprinted with or without minor alterations. His version differed distinc- tively from Zhang’s in that the former introduced three supernatural inci- dents and added a certain divine aura to the life of  a sage. These motifs are present in the following scenes: Qilin bringing a jade tablet to Confucius’s mother; Two dragons and five old men foreshadowing Confucius’s birth; and The Birth of Confucius. All three additions concern the auspicious birth of  Confucius, and their source of  inspiration was Buddhist art. Julia Murray interprets the 1497 Shengjitu’s introduction of  supernat- ural scenes inspired by Buddhist iconography as a possible attempt to compete with contemporary Buddhism, which Emperor Hongzhi °±  ( r .      1487–1505) generously supported.39 To compete with the divine, supernat- ural visuality of  Buddhism, Confucianism also needed to bring in such an element in compensation for removed icons. She further points out that the later proliferation of  the Shengjitu in various forms and media, especially after the iconoclasm of  1530, could reflect people’s persistent need for 38 For a thorough study of  the various stages of  Shengjitu’s evolvement starting from Zhang Kai’s 1444 version, see Murray’s “The Life of  Confucius,” 73–134; for Zhang Kai’s 1444 and He Tingrui’s 1497 versions, also see Kong Yangsheng     and Shangguan Maofeng &lt;23 ́,   “Studies on Shengjitu”   4 ;μ,   Rongbaozhai ¶· ̧ (2006.03): 214–15; for later editions and versions in the Qing Dynasty, see Shen Jin 1o,  “ Analysis of Shengjitu’s Editions”    D»¦1⁄4,   S tudies on Confucius 1⁄23⁄4-.

Confucius’s quasi-divine aura emitted by his icon was already shifting to his life narrative in the form of  supernatural motifs that suggested the heavenly sanction of  his birth, even before the nationwide removal of  his icons was enacted. Certainly Confucianist iconoclasm and the evolvement of  the sage’s narrative images in China do not share the same historical and cultural cir- cumstances with the European Reformation, where cultic icon and peda- gogic narrative were sharply contrasted by certain reformers. Furthermore, Catholic narrative images such as those in the EHI actively deployed by the Jesuits were not a defensive retreat from icon, but on the contrary were a bold reiteration of  medieval Catholic tradition in visually oriented con- templation.41 However, their historical experience in Europe must have prepared the Jesuits to understand and deal with Confucianists’ perception of  iconic and narrative images that they were to deploy in the mission project. It was in this visual culture of  a shift from icon to narrative that Aleni introduced the illustrated Vita Christi as a competing counterpart to the Vita Confucii, Shengjitu. As in a verbal catechism, Aleni’s adaptation to Confucianism in visual imagery was likely to follow a similar procedure: connect to the Confucian visual culture by fully exploiting analogical motifs, then move further to complement and overpower the latter. In this visual venture, both the analogical starting point and the next step beyond appear to center on the supernatural. Though Confucian literati were quite reserved about or even disparaging toward the supernatural, it was eventually the supernatural ele- ments that they needed to be persuaded of  if  Christianity would be fully accepted with its core doctrines of  Christology. Fortunately for the Jesuit missionaries’ project, Confucianists did not totally abhor the supernatural; 40 Julia K. Murray, “The Temple of  Confucius and Pictorial Biographies of  the Sage,” Journal of Asian Studies 55 (1996): 276.                             41 Jeffrey Chipps Smith, Sensuous Worship: Jesuit and the Art of Early Catholic Refor- mation in Germany (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2002), 36; on Pseudo- Bonaventure’s method, see Junhyoung Michael Shin, Et in picturam et in sanctitatem: Operat- ing Albrecht Dürer’s Marienleben (Berlin: Verlag für Wissenschaft und Forschung, 2003), 75.

Furthermore, by the time of the Jesuits’ mission, the motifs of  the supernatural had already intruded upon Confucianism, at least in its visual narrative. The three aforementioned supernatural scenes in the Shengjitu all sig- nify that the birth of  Confucius was sanctioned by Heavenly Mandate. Especially interesting are the two scenes of  Qilin bringing a jade tablet to Confucius’s mother (fig. 1) and The Birth of Confucius (fig. 2), which represent, respectively, the foretelling and the actual moment of  Con- fucius’s birth.42 The latter, with heavenly deities shrouded in clouds over the birth house, strongly mirrors the iconography of  Buddha ‡akyamuni’s birth. These two scenes resonate closely with the Annunciation (fig. 3) and the Nativity (fig. 4) events in the life of  Christ that are represented in the Jingjie. As an auspicious creature Qilin is informing Confucius’s mother of  her imminent conception of  the sage in the Shengjitu; the angel Gabriel brings similar news to the Virgin in the Jingjie. At the moment of  Con- fucius’s birth a group of  heavenly deities in clouds appear over the roof, as a choir of  angels are rejoicing over the stable of  Christ’s birth in the Jingjie. In other words, these two scenes have common themes of  heavenly sanction in the birth of  their protagonists, and their iconographies are very similar to each other. Such resemblances between the Shengjitu and the Jingjie could have been used as an initiating point, from which first by analogy and second by extension the Jesuits could advance further and persuade the Chinese of  their more diverse and dramatic scenes of  the supernatural. However, these two scenes of  birth in the Jingjie and the Shengjitu are their only common supernatural motifs. Even if  the Shengjitu had sought compensation for the lost superhuman aura of  the icon with the intro- duction of  supernatural motifs into the narrative, in essence the Shengjitu illustrated the life of  a man, not a deity, who taught about the earthly betterment of  human lives and institutions, not about the mysterious, eschatological, afterlife matters. Probably for this reason, the supernatural motifs in the Shengjitu were limited to the auspicious foreshadowing of the sage’s birth, and no more. Starting with these comparable scenes, Aleni had to advance stronger messages of  miracle, exorcism, and resuscitation in the Vita Christi, so that Christ appeared not merely as a sage comparable to Confucius but as God incarnate. Ultimately Aleni would have to per- suade the Chinese to accept the superhuman, supernatural realm of  Christ’s existence and life.   42 Since He Tingrui’s original 1497 did not survive, I will use Zhu Yinyi’s 1548 edition closely based on 1497 Shengjitu.

This was a heavenly sign that she would give birth to the great sage. iii. miraculous healing and exorcism in the life of christ Most of  Aleni’s catechistic literature, such as Scholarly Discussions in Fuzhou, True Origin of Things, and even the Daily Record of Oral Exhor- tations rarely discuss miraculous, supernatural power and its manifestation; they primarily present logical, rational discourses on a par with those of Confucianism. That is why Li Jiugong’s Yijian is rather unique, insofar as it recounts a wealth of  miraculous, supernatural incidents experienced by local Christians in contemporary Fujian. The Yijian is divided into three chapters, namely, “Miracles” (¿ ) , “Manifested Rewards” (ÀÁ ), and “Manifested Punishments” (ÂÃ ) ,    w   h   i c  h   carry subsections full of  super- natural stories. Zürcher pointed out that this lore of  stories revealed the practical Chinese view on religion: a religion counts as much as it works, in other words, as it is efficient in solving physical, mental, and natural hardships in life.43 However, the most significant and even striking point for me is that these local Christians experiencing the supernatural consist not only of  unedu- cated commoners, but also of  many literati including Li Jiugong himself 43 Zürcher, “Confucian and Christian Religiosity,” 643. Christianity’s power of  exorcism especially had great appeal to the Chinese from the era of  Ricci.

In the house, baby Confucius was just born and bathed by midwives, while his mother reclines on the bed. This motif  itself is very similar to the medieval iconography of  Christ’s birth, before the version of St. Bridget’s vision became dominant after the fifteenth century. At this moment, heavenly deities appear over the roof  to celebrate the sage’s birth with music. fully conversant in Confucian literature, which does not appreciate much of  superstitious ghostly stories.44 Thus these stories appear to attest to Confucianists’ tolerance or paradoxical need for the supernatural as protec- tive power against the evil and the unknown. If  so, the mysterious themes in the Jingjie could likewise find a firm abode among a literati audience and persuade them of  the supernatural message of  Christianity. The Jesuits did not need to resort entirely to the metaphysical terms of  Confucianism anymore, but could directly forward their religious message. Zürcher classified these mysterious stories in the Yijian into seven thematic categories, out of  which fou  r    a  r e    n  o   t    u   n  f amiliar in the visual narrative of  the Jingjie. The first two catagories I will discuss here are miraculous healing and exorcism of  demons. Since many of  the illnesses mentioned in these stories were caused by black magic or a curse, and mental disorders were often deemed to be demon possession both in Eu- rope and China, these two categories are closely related. Miraculous healings appear in eleven stories of  the Yijian and form the largest por- tion of  these stories. This topic is also frequently found in the Jingjie; there are, in total, seven scenes of  miraculous healing of  cripples, diseases, and blindness. Exorcism or a demon’s threat appear in about ten stories in 44 Zürcher observed that the supernatural and the miraculous were fully accepted by Chris- tian literati. “Confucian and Christian Religiosity,” 643. </page> <page sequence="18"> 346 Jesuit Adaptation to Confucianism Fig. 3.—Annunciation, in Tianzhu Jiangsheng Chuxiang Jingjie (Fuzhou, 1637), Bayerische Staatsbibliothek München, cod. sin. 23.

Even though Murray points out that the format of  separate panels for sepa- rate themes had already appeared and circulated by the late Ming period, the Chinese must have been quite used to the traditional way of  the afore- mentioned middle stage, which continued to occur even in the following Qing dynasty. The scene titled [Jesus] healed the feverish disease of Peter’s mother-in- law (fig. 5) demonstrates well motifs of  both disease healing and exorcism, and furthermore the Jingjie’s progression of  reading image, captions and connected textual amplification in the Jilüe. Both the scene and the cap- tion in this scene were barely altered from the original EHI, even though in other scenes minor omissions and additions occur occasionally. In the foreground stands Jesus in the act of  healing Peter’s fever-stricken mother- in-law; the foreground is marked with the third and fourth celestial cal- endar letters, Bing Ë and Ding Ì.

As Michael opened the way, Bi received baptism and believed with deep respect. Bi happened to fall ill and could not eat for about fifteen days, and no medicine was effective. One day, when he woke up at dawn, his eyes felt like they were covered and he could not even recognize someone standing in front of  him. Bi called out to the Lord Jesus and begged St. Francis to pray for him. For a short while he could see. That night he could not fall asleep, then he beheld a white- haired old man in white clothes, his whole body shining brightly, moving grace- fully in front of  the bed veil. Since miraculous light was emitting, Bi could not dare to gaze. Bi thought that the Lord came to him, so called again the holy name and bowed his head to the ground thrice. Next day he told Michael about this, and Michael believed the old man to be St. Francis, since he had seen the statue of St. Francis before. Eventually he recovered his sight in the night. Also his health had already improved. He asked a priest to pray to the Lord so that his sin could be absolved. Here, St. Francis serves as the conduit of  Christ’s power of  healing. How- ever, since he appears in Bi’s vision as he was depicted in his icon, it was his icon that was transmitting the power of  God to effect. The icon is merely one of  many holy objects that serve as divine agents in the stories of  the Yijian. Again, the use of  an icon in a religion other than Confu- cianism did not pose a problem for Confucian literati. On the contrary, the literati appear to have yearned for a protective, mysterious power of the icon that could fill in the gap of  their primarily ethical and institu- tional teachings of  Confucianism. In this regard another story is notable, in which a literatus, who lost his sight due to extensive study and reading, regained his vision and had good eye health up to his eighties, thanks to God’s power. For literati, eyesight and eye disease must have been quite a serious concern, and the Christian God was thought to be able to attend to such a practical problem as well. ^_` abÓ  cd ef  Ìghi  j×é{kl  imnop  qr st Ï48 u2  vc    swxFy  az 4M{|  }é{ ~s4  y×   é{×I 89: h  Ó|  &gt;   &gt; þ  /    M2 û   ô2qt        %¿ 5  3   52 Lixiu Yijian     ,   Bibliothéque nationale de France, Chinois 6878, 2:31b–32a. 53 Ibid., 2:32 b –33a. </page> <page sequence="24"> 352 Jesuit Adaptation to Confucianism In the town of  Minhou, there lived a man called Qiu, a bit over seventy years old. He converted in 1627 and attended Mass every day. But his temper was rather edgy, and he easily got angry. He also liked to read books, and due to much reading, he lost his sight in both eyes. Medicinal treatments over many years had no effect. Though two or three people talked to him [negatively about his religion], he upheld his faith more firmly. On every Mass day, he had someone help him into the church. One day during the Mass in the church, he suddenly beheld two angels in white clothes flanking the priest on the left and right. He deeply realized from this that the Lord was helping him silently, so he stopped taking medicine. His eyesight gradually was regained. Reaching the age of  eighty, his eyesight was even stronger, so that he could read even the books with very minute letters. The Heavenly Lord reflected upon his humble sincerity and im- mediately granted him a miraculous gift. A blind seventy-year-old literatus, not losing faith despite his physical suffering, beheld the vision of  angels in the Mass, and thereafter gained healthy sight up to the age of  eighty. The story may imply that his blind- ness was a punishment for his wrath-prone disposition. Returning to the picture (fig. 5), there are two incidents of  exorcism registered as background motifs. Indeed, the connected parts describing exorcism in the Jilüe 2:12 are more dramatic. i×  "/    ¡Kp n   ¢£Ùi¤Ó  &gt;&amp;¥ 7¦$  § v J   Ón   ̈©a$  7 4© i   Ù|«¬i   sù­ ® . . . 7  Ò4  ÉÓ ̄ô  Ù ̄° ±Ù°23 ́¥  $v &lt; 3⁄4n  7μ /¶  .   . .54 [As Jesus] entered the synagogue and taught the congregations, there was no one who did not respect him with [great] expectations.

This story belongs to the “Miracle” (¿  )  c hapter of  the Yijian, where most of  the healing and demonic stories are collated. I will cite only the pertinent part with a word-for-word translation.55 · ̧ z §1 oÓ »ì1⁄41⁄23⁄4Ù   1¿-1⁄4ÀÁÂ4  Ã1ìÄ &amp;ÅÆ  ÇÈÉÊ&lt;  ÎIËÌJÍÎ)Ï  1ÐÑ  N  ì &amp;ÑÄ  1  ÒIÓ  ÞtÔ4  ù ÕÖ 5  6            In the region of  Wenling, there lived a Christian literatus named Hong Qizhu. His younger cousin living in the country was possessed by a demon. One day when Hong went to this country to pay respect to his family graves, he saw his cousin shouting in a frenzy and running wildly. The cousin said that the found- ing (or ancestral) master possessed him. The family were shocked and called in a shaman for an exorcism. As Hong merely crossed himself, the cousin asked to be saved. Hong produced catechistic books from inside his sleeve and gave them to him, and finally the cousin came to his senses and calmed down. Here, the demon possessing the body of  the younger cousin was driven out by the sign of  the cross and holy books, which worked as agents transmitting God’s authority. It is significant that, as Zürcher indicated, here and in many other stories those miraculous healings and exorcisms were often conducted by a lay believer, usually an educated literatus con- vert. In other words, these literati were not only observing or passively receiving the healing, but they were actively participating in the trans- mission of  God’s power through prayers and holy objects. Such a direct experience and encounter with the holy and the evil is unseen in Con- fucian beneficiary prayer and ritualistic exorcism. In this regard it is noteworthy that the earlier Jesuit exorcisms of  the Ricci era had been con- ducted in a calm, less dramatic way that bore a greater resemblance to Confucian exorcism.57 The motif  of  a demon possession at the site of  graves in Li’s story is strongly reminiscent of  probably the most dramatic exorcism appearing in the Gospels, Matthew (8:28–33) and Luke (8:26–33). This biblical story was not illustrated as a major theme in the EHI or Jingjie, but it appears as one of  the background motifs in the scene titled [Jesus] crosses the sea and pacifies the wind ×=ØÙ ( E H  I: Sedat procellam maris Iesus). Here, the second marker Yi Ô  c  a   r ries a caption saying “Across the sea, the    55 This particular story was translated and presented in one of  Erik Zürcher’s articles.

In Gerasenes Jesus expelled the legion of demons from a possessed man living in the grave after he calmed the storm, which was chosen as the central theme in the EHI and Jingjie. Such memorable places as Gerasenes or Bethania (for Lazarus’s resurrec- tion) often appear in the background of  related or even nonrelated main themes in the EHI and Jingjie. In the story of  the Yijian, Hong and his family visited the graves of ancestors to conduct a filial rite, which was a common Confucian custom in China and Korea. Oddly, however, the possession of  his younger cousin took place in this setting, reminiscent of  the aforementioned bib- lical story at Gerasenes. Furthermore, the cousin shouts that the spirit of the founding master (ÈÉ)  possessed him. The character Zu È   c a  n    a  l s o mean ancestor, in which case the spirit might allude to an ancestral ghost.58 If  so, the whole story may be indirectly criticizing the sensitive issue of ancestral rites in China, which the Jesuits basically tolerated as long as they were conducted as an expression of  filial affection and respect. However, they could never quite fully come to terms with the rites’ reli- gious elements.59 In fact, this issue of  ancestral rites instigated a series of persecutions and mass martyrdoms of  Catholics in Korea in the eigh- teenth and nineteenth centuries.60 iv. rescue and resuscitation from death in the life of christ The motif  of  divine sanction in the birth of  Christ narrative underscores his status comparable to Confucius, and the next motifs of  healing and exorcism illuminate the divine authority of  Christ as far exceeding that 58 Zürcher also indicated that this ghost might be related to Hong’s clan.

Finally, Christ’s command over natural law, the most awe-inspiring moment of  divine revelation, is presented to complete the Jesuit methodology of  adaptation in visual narrative. In Li’s miraculous stories are found accounts of  rescue from natural disaster and resuscitation from death. The best account repre- senting the former is the story of  a child rescued from drowning, which appears in the little section titled “Rescue from Drowning” (ãä ) in the second chapter of  “Manifested Rewards” (ÀÁ) . I will cite significant parts.  åæÓ  çèF3⁄4 . . .  F3⁄4¿?  03⁄4éêë   ìk í x3⁄4îï Èð 4ñ±  û È ïò¥  3⁄4§ ó È  . . . òô¿ L13⁄4õ &lt;Æ±&amp; È LÓ&gt;ö ÷4øù  úàû/w ü¥ §ýIj È   2û &lt;þ$/  1ä /w ðÓ2&gt; 6  1             An old lady was raising three children. . . . One day the three children were going to school. The eldest son slipped and fell into the river, without leaving any trace. The second son ran and told his mother of  this. The mother heard of  this calmly and went to the icon of  Mary and prayed, “This child I leave unto thy hands.” . . . Finishing her prayer, she went [to the river]. She saw her son float on the water as if  he were running [on the water] and call out to her. People beholding this regarded it as incredible. When they helped the son come ashore, they asked him how he did not die. He answered, “The Holy Mother statue we venerate at home came to the water and held me, keeping me from sinking and being drowned. That’s how I survived. People hearing this felt great grace. In this story the agent of  God’s power is the Virgin Mary icon venerated in the household. Again, the miraculous power of  an icon is acknowledged and embraced by literati Christians, who wrote and read this kind of  story. Considering what happened to the icon of  Confucius earlier in 1530, it is quite surprising to observe that in about a hundred years the literati con- verts were acknowledging the power of  icons in Christianity. The Jesuits indeed succeeded in persuading the Chinese to accept the supernatural by this time, far beyo n d the stage of  making analogy to Confucian intellec- tualism.62 The toleration of  Buddhism and its icons was partially ascribed to the fact that Buddhism did not aim to take over the orthodox position of  Confucianism but rather remained as a nonpolitical, spiritual realm.63 On the other hand, Catholicism was successfully advancing its visual and 61 Yijian 2:33a–33b. 62 As discussed above, this could be largely explained by the inadequate explanation of  the supernatural dimension in Confucianism. The Jesuits deemed Confucianism essentially an ethical, institutional, and at best metaphysical discourse, upon which they could further build with their religious and supernatural teachings.

Even though the context and setting are rather different, this story is strongly reminiscent of  the scene titled Jesus walks on the sea 7 =          (EHI: Ambulat super mare Iesus) in the Jingjie (fig. 6). The last line of its caption directs us to read the Jilüe 4:1, which summarizes the story from Matthew 14:22–33.  =i¿  . . .

Peter said “If  this is my Lord, why not let me walk on the sea to reach him  ? ”  Jesus said “Come!” Peter ran onto the sea and walked on it as on the flat ground. Turning to see that the winds were raising waves, a change of  mind caused a little doubt and Peter immediately fell into the water. He repeatedly called out to Jesus to save him from drowning. Jesus gave him his hand and said “Man of  little faith! Why did you doubt?” While this story centers on Christ’s ability to walk on the water and en- courages a firm faith, the moment depicted and described in the Jingjie and the Jilüe represents Christ giving a hand to Peter and keeping him from drowning, exactly as Mary’s icon was holding the child from drown- ing in the Yijian. Therefore, this scene as an image could be viewed more impressively as a rescue rather than as a manifestation of  Christ’s divine power. The significance of  Christ’s walking on the water and rescuing Peter from drowning lies in that his authority and power overrules natural law.65 Probably in order to emphasize this point, a line was added with the caption marker Ren  ,   w hich did not appear at all in the original EHI.  .  7ø  Ù   +     [ R  e n . J e  s u s  ascends on board and gives an order; The wind and waves calm down and the ship reaches the shore shortly.]” Actually this comment, with only slight differences, appears in the earlier scene titled Jesus pacifies the turbulence of sea (Sedat procellam maris Iesus) in the EHI, which was drawn from Matthew 8:28– 64 Jilüe 4:1a–1b. 65 Both Qiong Zhang and Jonathan Spence discussed another picture representing the same moment, which Ricci had provided to Cheng Dayue to be printed in the latter’s picture book, Mr. Cheng’s Garden Ink Cakes      (  1  606). However, in this scene Christ stands on the firm ground of  shore rather than on the waving water as narrated in the Gospel and repre- sented in the Jingjie. It appears that Ricci did not want such a miraculous, supernatural story to raise doubts and derisions from his non-Christian Chinese audience.

Spence, The Memory Palace of Matteo Ricci (New York: Viking, 1984), 60–62. </page> <page sequence="29"> History of Religions 357 Fig. 6.—Jesus walks on the sea, in Tianzhu Jiangsheng Chuxiang Jingjie (Fuzhou, 1637).

The most dramatic and appealing of  the scenes of  Christ’s command over nature would be His triumph over death. Discussing these stories of resuscitation from death, Zürcher paid more attention to the revived per- son’s account of  postmortem experience in the heavenly tribunal rather than to the revival itself.67 In traditional Chinese folktales such a topos is not unprecedented, and there always is an authority deity, usually Bud- dhist, who returns the dead to the living world. In the stories of  Chinese Christians, the authority comes from the Christian God. For example, in a story translated by Jacques Gernet, St. Michael, under the authority of Christ, allows the dead man to return to life.68 Two scenes in the Jingjie show that such power originates in no one other than Jesus himself. One scene depicts the famous story of  the rais- ing of  Lazarus (John 11:38–46), and the other scene depicts the resusci- tation of  a widow’s dead son (Luke7:11–17). Even though the former scene is more famous to the extent that its town name, Bethania, appears as a background motif  in the scene titled Christ’s entry into Jerusalem, I find more resemblance in the latter to Li Jiugong’s stories, since the dead in Li’s stories are resuscitated shortly after their death and before burial. In the scene titled At Naim [Jesus] revived a widow’s son "#$%&amp; 4'3⁄4  ( E  H   I  :  Ad Naim suscitatur filius viduae), the fifth and sixth markers recount the story (fig. 7). This fifth line of  caption in the Jingjie is actually the fourth in the EHI, and the sixth is slightly modified from the fifth in the EHI, which I provide here for comparison.

Far in the background across the water are found the letter Wu + and two men standing ashore, which is linked with the caption “Jesus’s wondrous trace spread all around.

Probably Aleni as editor intended a thematic focus on Jesus’s miraculous power.

A certain lady was deeply grieving. The old widow had relied on this only son and lost him. Jesus felt sympathy and consoled her, saying “You do not cry.” And touching the carriage to stop, Jesus called out, saying “Son, I order you to stand up.” The dead immediately raised himself  and finally could speak. (In Western custom, when they transport the corpse for burial, days after death, they place the body on a carriage and transport it to the burial place. Therefore once Our Lord gave an order, the dead immediately moved and spoke.) All the carriers marveled at this miracle and praised the great mercy of  the Lord. For the Chinese, who have different funeral and burial customs, an expla- nation of  European custom was inserted in smaller script, which I mark with parentheses above. A parallel story appears in the “Resurrection” (Mb ) section of  the “Manifested Reward” (ÀÁ)   chapter of  the Yijian. It recounts a woman’s experience of  temporary death. She was returned to life by the order of God so that she could forewarn the living to repent of  their sins.   æ    ûþ ̧I&lt;  J  7KLMJN   OPÓ  ±Q R / s v Sc \T  U/ûïP  wV WKXBYZ  wÓ [\  4¥  ©]©Z G  $M    ^ZPK \  W   3 \ê ðÓ_ `KL  M ÓN¥  $à+ s $ &gt;Pæ  ± ? \/   aK È ï bcZ dÑþ eëÖfiW 7 0       There was a woman who solemnly took the trouble to recite holy books, and took it as her duty to care for the poor all her life. She appeared to be a wholly virtuous person. However, she had committed sins when she was young, which she did not let others know. For years she tried to be absolved of  her sins, but she did not inform the priest of  it. When she  d  ied, the next day her daughter came to her dead body and cried. The dead woman suddenly woke up as if  from sleep, and said to her, “Do not fear, do not cry. Praise the Lord for letting me resurrect. Hurry to the priest and bring him so that he can absolve me of  my sin.” The daughter [did] as she said, and [the woman] asked [the priest] to ab- solve her of  her sins. People hearing this, came one after another to see. The resurrected woman said to the crowd, “I seemed to others like a wholly virtu- ous woman when living, but when I was younger I committed sin, for which I did not get absolution. This day I truly repented and cried in front of  the Holy Mother, and asked desperately for her help, so that I could be spared from fall- ing into hell.” 69 Jilüe 3:9a. 70 Yijian 2:51b–52b </page> <page sequence="33"> History of Religions 361 The woman continued to recount how the Virgin Mary implored Jesus to forgive her earlier sins because of  her good deeds in adulthood. At first Jesus resisted, pointing out the strictness of  heavenly law, but eventually yielded to his mother’s intercession and allowed the woman to return to life so that she could amend her earlier sins and receive full blessing af- terwards. Zürcher found interesting a different story from the Good Death gh                   (as opposed to Evil Death) section of  the Yijian, and further another story translated by Gernet.71 These two stories describe in full detail the pro- tagonists’ observation of  the heavenly tribunal, where Christ appeared as the Judge. The story I translated above also devoted a large portion to recounting the heavenly tribunal and especially Mary’s role as intercessor. However, I would like to focus on Christ’s authority and power of  resus- citation itself, since resuscitation from death is far more appealing than the healing and exorcism. When the Jingjie and the Yijian reached the realm of  resurrection beyond healing and exorcism, the analogy with Confucianism could not hold anymore. The initial foundation of  Confucian analogy broke and the supernatural, divine power of  Christ was manifested to persuade the Chinese. It was in this way that the Jingjie best served Aleni’s proselyti- zation project. The core message of  Christology, Christ’s divine nature, is revealed in such awe-inspiring miracle tales of  conquering death, in front of  which earthly oriented Confucianism or extinction-seeking Buddhism do not offer many consoling answers. In this light, Aleni’s Chinese adap- tation of  Evangelicae Historiae Imag i nes could indeed penetrate into the minds of  Confucian literati as well as commoners no less than Buddhism had done a thousand years before the advent of  Christianity in China.
