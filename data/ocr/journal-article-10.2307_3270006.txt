<plain_text><page sequence="1">Numen, Vol. XXX VIII, Fasc. 1 THE ALMOHAD TAWHID: THEOLOGY WHICH RELIES ON LOGIC MADELEINE FLETCHER Summary The Almohad dynasty of twelfth century Spain and North Africa patronized the study of Greek philosophy. Almohad scholars were largely responsible for editing and commentating the texts of Aristotle which came into the hands of Thomas Aquinas, greatly facilitating the development of scholastic theology in thirteenth century Europe. This paper investigates the theology of Ibn Tumart to describe the extent to which this taste for philosophy was consistent with the teaching of the aforemen- tioned founder of the Almohad movement who was a Berber jurist from the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. We find that Ibn Tumart's teaching assigns a radically important role to reason in theology, declaring reason to be a source of religious doctrine along with scripture (the Koran and the Hadith). Throughout the essay, internal evidence provided by an ongoing comparison between Ibn Tumart's two murshidas and what had previously been assumed to be his most important credal document, his 'aqfda, reveals the latter to have been the product of a heavy editing process which occurred after Ibn Tumart's death, prob- ably in 1183 at the time of the writing down of the manuscript a'azzu ma yutlab which was published as Le livre d'Ibn Toumert by Luciani in 1903. The paper attempts to define Ibn Tumart's theology of tawhfd in relation to other systems in which the word functions as a concept. Possible definitions thus provided are accepted or rejected. Questions considered are: 1 Whether Almohad tawhfd can be seen as a denial of the attributes of God as in Mu'tazilite theology. 2 Whether Almohad tawhid can be seen as the tawhid of ittisdl or of Pantheistic monism. 2 Whether Almohad tawhfd and its aspect of anti-anthromorphism can be seen as a rejection of animistic and folkloric remnants. Resume La dynastie almohade, qui regnait sur l'Espagne musulmane et l'Afrique du Nord au XIIe siecle, favorisa l'6tude de la philosophie grecque. Les 6rudits almo- hades preparerent les editions et commentaires d'Aristote qui furent transmises rapidement ' Thomas d'Aquin, et faciliterent beaucoup le developement de la pensee scolastique de l'Europe au cours du XIIIe siecle. Cette 6tude puise dans la theologie du mahdi Ibn Tumart, fondateur du mouve- ment almohade, les 6lements qui indiquent que cette tendence philosophique 6tait deji pr6sente dans la pensee d'Ibn Tumart, un juriste berbere n6 dans le haut Atlas. Il est remarquable, en effet, que l'enseignement d'Ibn Tumart accorde a la raison une importance essentielle dans la th6orie et la considere comme une source de la connaissance religieuse a ajouter aux Ecritures (le coran et le hadith), sources traditionelles de la conaissance religieuse.</page><page sequence="2">The Almohad Tawhfd 111 Dans cette investigation, la comparaison entre les murshida d'Ibn Tumart et le document qui avait ete considere jusqu'a present l'expression la plus importante de sa doctrine, le 'aqfda, montre At l'vidence que ce dernier ne date pas de l'6po- que d'Ibn Tumart mais qu'il a 6t6 6dite et modifie apres sa mort, probablement vers 1183, I'annee de la redaction du manuscrit A 'azzu mayutlab publi6 par Luciani en 1903 sous le titre Le livre d'Ibn Topumert. Cette 6tude essaye de definir la theologie du tawhfd almohade a la lumiere d'autres theologies qui emploient le meme mot "tawhid." L'examen critique des questions soulev~es se presente ainsi: 1 Peut-on considerer que le tawhfd almohade rejette les attributes de Dieu comme dans la theologie mu'tazilite? 2 Peut-on consi- darer le tawhfd almohade comme le tawhfd de ittisdl (l'union mystique avec l'Un) ou celui du monisme pantheiste? 3 Peut-on considerer que le tawhfd almohade dans son aspect d'anti-anthropomorphisme rejette les elements de l'animisme folk- lorique de l'islam populaire? The Almohad dynasty of twelfth century Spain and North Africa patronized the study of Greek philosophy. Works such as Averroes' commentaries on Aristotle, Ibn Tufayl's philosophical novel Hayy Ibn Yaqzan and Moses Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed, show the personality of this Almohad renaissance which enormously influ- enced European thirteenth century scholasticism through the writings of Saint Thomas of Aquinas and others who studied these authors. The problem examined in this article is the relationship between this Almohad high culture and the theology of the Madhi Ibn Tumart who founded the Almohad movement. Ibn Tumart was a Berber jurist (faqfh) from Morocco, whose movement spread from his native Atlas mountains to become an empire which included all of North Africa and most of Spain and Portugal. As a jurist, Ibn Tumart's life and thought had ethical and juridical dimensions which lie outside the scope of the present article which deals exclusively with his theology. Ibn Tumart's theology prefigures the splendid Almohad philosophical development in his abstract definition of the nature of the One God. His use of tawhfd as the central principle of his move- ment differed from his use of mahdism and miracles which were political tools appropriate to the Berber tribal environment. In his own mind, Ibn Tumart identified his movement with the abstract definition of God's Oneness, or tawhrd: so his followers were called Almohads or al-Muwahhidrn: "those who declare tawhid". Tawhfd was the focus of an extraordinary teaching effort during</page><page sequence="3">112 Madeleine Fletcher the lifetime of Ibn Tumart. The anonymous historical chronicle al- Hulal al-Mawshiyya describes the teaching process:' "The first thing [Ibn Tumart] did upon taking command was to write them a book in the Berber language which he called al-tawhid. It was divided into seven parts according to the seven days of the week, and he ordered them to read a section each day after the morning prayer after finishing the selection from the Koran. In it, there was the knowledge of God and the other dogmas, such as the knowledge of God's decrees, and predestination, and faith in what is characteristic of God, and of what is impossible in Him and what is possible, and what a Muslim should do to impose orthodoxy and prohibit the illicet and to join together in brotherhood for this pur- pose." The essence of tawhzd was contained in the murshidas2 or short credal statements, which Ibn Tumart's followers memorized under pain of death (for the first two failures to memorize the punishment was whipping, and for the third, death). There are also many texts entitled tawhfd in Le livre d'Ibn Toumert,3 consisting of theology which is independent of the Koran, the hadith or jurisprudence. Some of these must be from the original book of Ibn Tumart men- tioned above, but which ones they are cannot be known for sure since it seems clear from internal inconsistencies that not all of Le livre is Ibn Tumart's. Many things including the Almohad 'aqfda seem to have been edited and new passages written, some perhaps date from 1183 when the compilation was written down during the reign of the Almohad Caliph Yusuf (the patron of Averroes). There is a passage entitled "on the understanding of the manner of prov- ing the knowledge of tawhzd" in the terse epigrammatical style which we have come to identify as characteristic of Ibn Tumart. In it tawhfd is said to be known by reason or logic, and what follows is a proof of God from the Creation:4 "Chapter on the understanding of the manner of proving the knowledge of tawhid: By the necessity of logic His tawhid is known, Praise to Him, through the wide testimony of His acts from the aspect of the necessity of created things for a Creator, and the necessity of the existence of a Creator, praise to Him and the impossibility of the entrance of doubt as to the existence of Him whose existence is necessary."</page><page sequence="4">The Almohad Tawhid 113 Thus it seems that for Ibn Tumart, the concept of tawhid included the study of a number of theological themes where there was a sphere for reason independent of revelation and hadith. During the reign of the first Almohad caliph, the tawhid con- tinued to be central Almohad propaganda. It was the level of knowledge of the tawhfd and of the other standard Sunni elements such as the Koran and the hadith, which determined the position of individuals in the hierarchical levels of the propaganda organiza- tion which constituted the Almohad governmental structure.5 There is a circular letter known as Risdlat al-Fusul6 which was sent from the chancellory of the first caliph, Abd al-Mu'min, to each newly conquered city.' Its instructions show the importance given to tawhld: "First, begin with the first principle of Islam and inculcate the people with the knowledge of the tawhid." The letter orders all the inhabitants on pain of death to memorize the shorter murshida: "And included in this obligation are the men and women and the free and the slave and everyone who is legally responsible, since no action on their part will be correct and no word from them accepti- ble without their understanding the tawhld." The tawhid is discussed again during the reign of the second Almohad caliph, Yusuf Abu Ya'qub in the disquisition on usul in le livre. Although this introductory sect-ion supposedly represents the gist of Ibn Tumart's oral teaching based on notes taken down by his followers, internal evidence suggests it was importantly re-cast in 1183.8 The passage shows the rationalizing tendency typical of the second generation of Almohads and the court of Yusuf, the phi- losopher king, patron of Averroes. It declares that tawhld relies for its validity upon logical reasoning:9 "The method of tawhld is logical reasoning (al-'aql), and likewise the tanzih (elimination of anthropomorphic elements) and there is no way for multiple transmission to be used in the two of them." Now if tawhzd is both 1) essential to belief, and 2) known by logic, it follows inescapably that a correct understanding of logic is essen- tial to belief. So we have arrived at Averroes' standpoint in the Fasl al-Maqal,'0 namely, that philosophical truth has a kind of final authority in religion. This way of understanding tawhid provides a</page><page sequence="5">114 Madeleine Fletcher religious justification for the study of philosophy. The passage demonstrates the spirit of Almohadism at its most typical; a mind- set which prefers where possible to depend upon reason and to follow the rules of logic. This attitude is in accord with Tumart's original texts on tawhid and is the germ of later Almohad achievements in philosophy, but the idea is by no means a universally held notion in Sunni Islam. For example, two centuries before the above passage was written, an Eastern Malikite, al-Baqillani, flatly contradicted the notion that tawhid is to be understood by logical reasoning:" "We have shown elsewhere the falsity of [the Qadariyya's] asser- tion that the necessity of knowing and professing God's unity is something known by the intellect and hence is in no need of an Apostle to summon to it." The fact is that this is an old argument which arose between the Qadariyya or Mu'tazilites and the more traditional thinkers and continued to be debated during the time of the Almohads. The complex history of this debate on the position of reason is one of the main threads in the development of Islamic theology. What is clear from the outset is that the Almohads founded their ideology upon tawhid and assigned a radically important role to reason in theology. In the next sections we will consider the linkages between Almohad terminology and existing movements and currents of thought. The relationship of Almohad theology to Mu'tazilite tawhid, defined as a denial of the sifat, or Attributes of God The Almohads were not the first to use the word tawhid in a theological context. What scholars of Islam would associate with the word tawhfd is the concept developed by the Mu'tazilites who called themselves "the people of justice and tawhid" in the well-known and much vexed eighth century controversy on the nature of God. By this time Ibn Tumart studied in Baghdad, certain issues in this controversy had been the subject of scholastic debate among Muslim religious scholars for almost four centuries. H. A. Wolfson'2 has made an exceedingly interesting study of the context of the original Mu'tazilite debate and sees the first Mu'tazilites as reacting to a previous islamic theology which had</page><page sequence="6">The Almohad Tawhfd 115 been strongly influenced by philosophical concepts current among late Greek Christian theologians concerning the trinity, concepts which probably owed their existence to pagan Neoplatonism. An example of this Neoplatonic influence is the concept of the attributes (sifdt) of God which maintain a separate but united existence (Christian theology has a similar concept in the three per- sons of the Godhead). The Mu'tazilites considered this early islamic doctrine of attributes to be the heresy of "giving God an associate" or tashrik and insisted upon tawhid or the denial of these attributes. In the context of this same early polemic the Mu'tazilites learned Greek philosophy to refute their opponents for whom it constituted the only acceptible form of proof. After this early point the controversy carried its own inertia of motion, even though the context of the original objection to the attributes or sifdt was forgotten. The Mu'tazilites enjoyed the sup- port of the government for a while and showed much cruelty to those who disagreed with them in the mihna or inquisition of 832- 847 A.D. Ousted from their dominant position by the time of Ibn Tumart's arrival in Bagdad in about 1107 A.D., they continued to oppose the notion of sifdt which persisted among the Ash'arite theologians who had replaced them in the position of dominance. Thus the sifdt remained a bone of contention between the Ash'arites and the Mu'tazilites who felt they had to deny the attibutes, a position called ta'til. Ibn Khaldun describes Mu'tazilite ta'til as follows:13 "The Mu'tazilites broadened the meaning of the dean- thropomorphization (al-tanzfh) which is implied in the negative verses [such as 'Nought is there like Him' (42:9) and 'There is none equal with Him' (112:4)] and took it to mean the denial of the attributes conceived as things (sifdt al-ma'adnO, such as knowledge and power and will and life, in addition to [taking it to mean the mere denial of the literalness of] these terms used as predications (za'ida 'alad ihkamiha) [that is, used in the form of participles such as knowing and powerful and willing and living]." In spite of Ibn Khaldun's conventional islamic decorum which presents the controversey purely in terms of Koranic exegesis, the reader can hardly imagine how the problem thus stated could have arisen from the exclusive consideration of Koranic text. The very</page><page sequence="7">116 Madeleine Fletcher abstract nature of the terminology suggests a non-koranic origin, making Wolfson's explanation which goes back to the Greek sources entirely satisfying and convincing. To return to the question of whether interpreting Almohad tawhfd as a Mu'tazilite denial of the attributes is an appropriate way to understand Ibn Tumart's doctrine,'4 the following brief passage in the shorter murshida gives a glimpse of this problem: "He possesses greatness and majesty, power and perfection, knowledge and freewill, sovereignty and power, life and duration and the beautiful names." With respect to the attributes of God or sifdt, which the Mu'tazilites denied (ta'tfl) we see that Ibn Tumart does avoid the word sifd, neither afirming nor denying but speaking only of God's names (asma') but that he concedes qualities in God which he specifies. In afatwa or juridical decision written specifically on this shorter murshida, the famous Hanbalite jurist Ibn Taimiyya seems to include Ibn Tumart among those such as the Mu'tazilites for whom the essential meaning of tawhfd is the negation of the attributes. He bases his suspicion on the use of the name Al-Muwahhid in his final summation on the point:'5 "The Jahmiya who deny the attributes-Mu'tazilites and other schismatics-call tawhfd the negation of attributes... The author of the murshida has given his followers the name of Al-Muwahhid following those same people who invented themselves a conception of God contrary to divine revelation-since they denied the concept of unity as the Koran has revealed it."' But this would seem to be an exaggeration of Ibn Tumart's posi- tion on the attributes, since we see that in his murshida he grants God individual qualities which he specifies. In any case Ibn Taimiyya's opinion, written 200 years after Ibn Tumart's murshida, gives a perspective of a later generation on the issue. In contrast to Ibn Tumart's murshida, which follows Mu'tazilite dogma, the Almohad 'aqfda clearly follows Asharite dogma and specifically denies Mu'tazilite ta'til by name, although the word "attribute" (sifd) does not appear. We have mentioned that we suspect that the 'aqnda represents a revision of Ibn Tumart's thought by others at a later date, while the murshida criticized by Ibn</page><page sequence="8">The Almohad Tawhfd 117 Taimiyya is, beyond any reasonable doubt, exclusively Ibn Tumart's original phrasing. The difference between the two documents reflects the growing popularity of the Ash'arites over the Mu'tazilite school in the course of the twelfth century. (In contrast, at the turn of the century Al-Ghazali also preferred the Mu'tazilites).'6 The 'aqfda presents a specifically Ash'arite slant on a number of questions, for example, on the attributes:"7 "There is a limit to human understanding at which it stops and which it does not exceed. And that is the inability to assign modality (an explanation of particular circumstances) and past this limit [human understanding] has no sphere and application except anthropomorphism and ta'tfl (denying God all His attributes) and that is absurd and unthinkable-and everything which leads to the absurd is absurd." In conclusion, the identification of Almohad tawhfd with the negation of the attributes is clearly an inadequate understanding of the issue. While Ibn Tumart's murshida appears to hold a moderate Mu'tazilite position on the attributes, the 'aqfda clearly takes the Ash'arite position. Thus any simplistic notion of the meaning of the Almohad tawhfd in this connection will have to be discarded in favor of the general notion of tawhfd as an exercise in the abstract defini- tion of God. The most interesting aspect of the controversy about the sifdt in general is how it attests a persistent influence of Neoplatonism. Although over the four centuries of polemic, the attributes of God are alternately seen as an element of innovation and as an element of tradition, the long life of the controversy shows the vigor of an original Neoplatonism which persisted as a surprisingly consistent influence in Islamic as in Christian theology. Almohad Tawhfd as Pantheistic Monism There is a poetic passage in Ibn Tumart's murshida which is clearly pantheistic: "He is unique in all eternity; nothing coexists with Him, nothing exists outside of Him, neither land nor sky, nor water nor air, neither populated nor unpopulated world, neither light nor shadows, nor night nor day, nor reality nor noise, sound nor mur-</page><page sequence="9">118 AMadeleine Fletcher mur; there is only the Unique, the Irresistable. He is in all eternity, the only one to possess uniqueness, domination and divinity. Nothing guides created things with Him, nothing shares power with Him. He has the sentence and the decision; the laud and the praise." Certainly the above statement "Nothing exists outside of Him" sounds like Plotinus' pantheistic monism, with its idea that the world is really only the One. This presents us with yet another meaning associated with the term tawhfd as a possible interpretation of Ibn Tumart's concept of tawhfd in the murshida. Tawhid with its root in wdhid, the Arabic word for the number one, could be taken as a reference to making the One the source from which all comes. Speaking of the pantheistic passages of Al-Ghazali's Mishkdt al- Anwar, Wensinck identifies them as Neoplatonic:'8 "It is clear that this extremist monism, to which we have already alluded above, is Plotinian rather than Islamic. One cannot hide the fact that the easy infiltration of that extremism is explained in large part by the usage of the term tawhid which is the technical term expressing equally the central dogma of Islam and the essence of Plotinian thought..." Neoplatonic influence would have been in the air in Baghdad when Ibn Tumart studied there, in so far as it has been found in his contemporary, al-Ghazali. The elite was familiar with Neoplatonic writings, but the practical expression of the doctrine was far more widespread in the ecstatic exercises of Sufis. The trance state which the Sufis called ittisdl and interpreted as a state of union with God was also at the heart of Neoplatonic philoso- phy.'9 Moreover, the pantheism mentioned above is both a tenent of Neoplatonic philosophy and a psychological reality of the trance experience in which the person in the trance state believes himself to be connected to everything while at the same time attaining the One.20 Thus the pantheistic monism of the murshida may give evidence of Ibn Tumart's familiarity with the trance state which contradicts assertions that he had nothing to do with Sufism.21 Once again, in contrast to the murshida, the passage in the 'aqida on this sensitive subject is extremely discrete and very brief:22 "Anything which is conceived of must be restricted to the ten following terms: before and after, underneath and above, right and</page><page sequence="10">The Almohad Tawhid 119 left, in front of and behind, whole and part: and that, given that for anyone to be restricted to these terms, it is necessary to be created and to have need of a Creator, a Creator who is the Independent and the Glorious." In other words, God is not created so He is not subject to the distinction between whole and part since the 'aqida stipulates that only created beings are restricted to these terms. If He is not subject to a distinction between whole and part, God may be defined as the One, who is the whole and everything, although we will not be able to conceive of this, since, according to the 'aqida, our minds are restricted in their conceptions to the ten terms. In this way, pan- theistic monism is suggested in the 'aqfda but not openly declared as in the murshida. This means that objections had been raised and had been addressed by editing on this point without completely los- ing the basic idea. The difference between the two documents on this point is further evidence that the 'aqfda is a revision of Ibn Tumart's thought with a view to its acceptance in the milieu of al- Andalus in 1183 rather than his original words. Thus to answer the question of whether the interpretation of tawhfd as pantheism is valid we can say yes, basing ourselves on the undoubted authen- ticity of the first murshida and its uncontrovertably pantheistic statements. Looking to the future development of this idea, the pantheistic monism of the Sufi thinker Muhy al-Din al-'Arabi falls well within the limits set by Ibn Tumart's murshida. Almohad Tawhzd as anti-A nthropomorphism A part of tawhfd or "abstract theology',, as we have now defined it, is tanzfh, or the rejection of any comparison of God with created beings. Ibn Tumart mentions this as an ingredient of tawhid in a letter to the Alhomad community:23 "Be assiduous to learn what you should of your religious obliga- tions and work on learning the tawhfd because it is the basis of your religion, in order to deny all comparison (tashbfh) or association (tashrfk) to the Creator, or any idea of imperfection, diminution, limit or direction. Do not situate Him in a place, nor in a direction; because the All High exists before places and directions. He who</page><page sequence="11">120 Madeleine Fletcher puts him in a place or a direction gives Him a corporal form; and he who gives him a corporeal form makes Him a created being; and he who makes Him a created being is like he who worship an idol. And he who dies in this belief will stay forever in hell! But he who learns his tawhid comes out pure of his sins as the day his mother bore him: if he dies in that state, he will stay in Paradise." By the time of Ibn Tumart's visit to Bagdad, the Ash'arites had adopted this Mu'tazilite doctrine of anti-anthropomorphism but both schools were opposed on this point by a large group of scholars, mainly Hanbalites. The Almohad murshida takes the Mu'tazilite-Ash'arite attitude, namely tanzfh or the total disassocia- tion of God from human characteristics or an anti- anthropomorphist view of God. The conventional theory24 about anthropomorphism is that it arises from certain passages in the Koran where normal linguistic usage would imply a human from God, since they mention God sit- ting on the throne or descending, and speak of parts of the body in connection with God. People interpreted these expressions variously, some Hanibalites feeling they should be taken in a literal sense25 while the Mu'tazilites and the Ash'arites preferred an allegorical sense (ta'wil). This anti-anthropomorphism was a cen- tral point of Almohad dogma to which great political importance was given, since "Anthropomorphists" (mujassimzin), meaning those who give God a body, was the insult used as war-cry against the Almoravids during Ibn Tumart's campaigns against them. To look beyond Koranic exegesis to the contexual root of this anti-anthropomorphism, on the simplest level, namely that of local anthropology, Ibn Tumart's emphasis against anthropomorphism could in part be a reaction against animistic and folkloric remnants of the pre-Islamic paganism. We have the testimony of the geographer Ibn Hawqal from about the year 951, a century before the Almoravids. He describes the region of the Sus in Morocco (Ibn Tumart's native land) saying:26 "The Malikites are to be counted among the more crude Anthropomophists" ... "one deplores the depraved customs of the Malikites, the more their living standard rises, the more brutal and turbulent they become." Since Ibn Hawqal was a traveler not a theologian, he must have meant some very obvious pagan ritual or belief.</page><page sequence="12">The Almohad Tawhld 121 A century and a half later in his letters to the Almohad com- munity, Ibn Tumart points out that the Almoravids, who persecute the pious Almohads as heretics, consider as their obedient subjects "those who follow lies and the footsteps of Satan using pagan prac- tices and eating illicit food",27 In Le livre we read "tawhfd destroys what was before it of unbelief kufr and remnants or relics athadr." (p. 276) and " Tawhfd is the affirmation of the One and the refutation of all that is not He, be it a divinity, an associate, a saint or an idol (tdghuit)." (p. 271). Ibn Qattan testifies to Ibn Tumart's campaign against paganism among the mountain tribes. In spite of these indications, it is unfortunately in the nature of folk-belief to leave scant written evidence so the specific beliefs can not be described, but it is clear that at various times Ibn Tumart emphasized tawhfd in opposition to paganism or to a local Islam mixed with some pagan elements. In any case Ibn Tumart has a great deal to say against anthropomorphism. He takes the Mu'tazilite position of radical tanzfh or denial of the similarity between God and man to the point that he says more about what God is not than about what He is. For example the opening passage from the shorter murshida presents the kind of negative definition which is recapitulated in page after page of Le livre: "There is no God other than the One whom existing things show and created things attest, since existence is absolutely necessary to God, and that without restriction or particularization of time, place, orientation, term, kind, form, figure, measure, aspect and state. He is the First without being limited by anything before Him, the Last without being limited by anything after Him; Unique without being limited by place; Invoked, without being limited by quality; Glorious, without being limited by similarity. He is neither determined by the intelligence nor represented by the imagination nor attained by thought, nor conceived of by reason. He is not expressed by localization and deplacement, nor by transformation and disappearance, nor by ignorance and constraint, nor by powerlessness and needyness." The negative definition of God evident here,28 was attacked by Ibn Taimiyya in the aforementioned fatwa or legal brief he wrote</page><page sequence="13">122 Madeleine Fletcher on Ibn Tumart's murshida. He was motivated to undertake this criticism by his disagreement with the religious thought of a group of Maghribian followers of Ibn al-Arabi and Ibn Sab'in with whom he was debating in Alexandria. Thus Ibn Taimiyya's fatwa illuminates the clear filiation of thought between Ibn Tumart and Ibn al-Arabi and Ibn Sab'in as well as showing that in Ibn Taimiyya's mind, there was a link between all three of them and the philosophers. Ibn Taimiyya, writing in 1310, says:29 "As for those who are opposed to the prophets like the philosophers and their like, they describe God by negative attributes; they say that God is neither of this way nor of that, nor of another, and they refuse to describe God by positive attributes. Now only nothingness can be described only by a negative. God, according to their description, is thus assimilated to nothingness and no difference remains between what they affirm and nothingness. Nevertheless they say that God exists and that He is not nothingness. Thus they are in contradiction with themselves, since on the one hand they say that God exists, while on the other they deny it." It does seem that the negative definition has far less afinity with the Semitic notion of divinity than with the ideas of Greek philoso- phy, be it Neoplatonic or Aristotelian. The negative definition is also compatible with the Sufi experience of mystical union [gnosis or ma'rifa] which was spreading throughout the Islamic world at that time, since a God inherently undefined as to specific form, place, aspect or state is more plausably compatible with the psycho- logical reality of the perception of the One which constitutes the mystic trance. We have already spoken of the connection of Neoplatonism with Sufism through the psychological truth of the trance state in which the perception of the One is interpreted as being the state of ittisdl or union with God. Through its compatibility with the concept of the Prime Mover of the Aristotelian natural science then current,"3 the Almohad notion of a God known by logical reasoning and definable in abstract philosophical language allows for the mediation of natural laws between God and creation, thereby legitimizing and even mandating the study of these laws through natural science and phi- losophy. Thus the theology of Ibn Tumart leads to the seemingly</page><page sequence="14">The Almohad Tawhzd 123 paradoxical duo: mysticism and scientific thought, as components of the Almohad synthesis of two Greek philosophical systems: that of Plotinius and that of Aristotle. Political ramifications of the doctrine of tawhzd A further consequence of the premise that God is knowable through logical reasoning is to take away from Revelation its posi- tion as primary and indespensible evidence for God, since it posits that human reason without Revelation is itself sufficient to arrive at the truths of religion. This is the message incarnated by Hayy ibn Yaqzan, the protagonist of Ibn Tufayl's philosophical novel who, although born apart from mankind (by spontaneous genera- tion on a deserted island), is able to discover all the truths of Revelation through a process of introspection and observation of the natural world. Thus perfectly reasonable men are held to be able to know theological truth by the light of unaided reason. We may perhaps see consequences of this point of view not only for Muslims but also unhappy ones for Jews and Christians, whose Revelation was the basis of the tolerant truce the Muslims extended to the 'people of the book' living under Muslim rule. The agressive certainty of the new theology and new historical circumstances abrogated this tolerance. The obligatory memorization of the creed, and the forced conversion of Christians and Jews (including Moses Maimonides' father and his family) may thus be ideological as well as a reaction to deteriorating political relationships. The Andalusian Christians [mozarabes] had broken with Muslim protec- tion in 1126 A.D. by giving Alfonso el Batallador of Aragon military assistance in his raids and in consequence the Almoravids had expelled many of them to Morocco. Andalusian Muslims had not contemplated living peacefully under Christian rule since 1085, when Alfonso VI of Castille broke the terms of the treaty under which the Muslims of Toledo had surrendered to him by converting the cathedral mosque of Toledo into a Christian cathedral. While political and military insecurity made the Muslims suspicious and fearful of their non-Muslim subjects, the new theological statement laid a claim to universality which the former koranic declaration about the people of the book did not.3'</page><page sequence="15">124 Madeleine Fletcher In conclusion, Ibn Tumart's theology can be seen to parallel the later Almohad cultural development, both in its self-conscious dependence upon a process of reasoning which foreshadows the official Almohad support for Averroes' work on Aristotle, and in its expression of pantheistic mysticism, which foreshadows the peculiar and very influential personality of Muhy al-Din Ibn al-'Arabi.

Hopkins, Medieval Muslim Government in Barbary, London, Luzac, 1958 studies the Alhomad organizational structure. 6 E. LUvi-Provengal, Documents inidits d'histoire Alhomade (Paris: Paul Geuthner, 1928) vol. I p. 134-145. 7 This is from a version of this letter sent March 2, 1161 to Bougie (Bijaya). Levi-Provengal has reasoned on the basis of the existence of an identical letter sent to the talibs of Gibraltar after 1160, plus an allusion to what appears to be a similar letter in a letter written in 1143, that this letter was first written by Abu Ja'far Ibn Atiya and used repeatedly after his death.

J. McCarthy, paragraph 45 trans p. 17 Al-Baqillani mentions here his other writings on this subject: the introductions to books on uszl al-fiqh, and chapters on the "imputation of justice and injustice to God" in books on usiil diyanat. Unfor- tunately these have been lost. 12 Wolfson substantiates his conclusions with textual examples comparing specific Arabic terms with their Greek counterparts The Philosophy of the Kalam, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1976. Wolfson's work has not been used where it would have been illuminating. For example, Richard MacDonough Frank in his book Beings and their Attributes</page><page sequence="16">The Almohad Tawhfd 125 (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1978) in the chapter on "The Background and Evolution of the Concept of the Attributes," has taken the use of grammar as determining the thought of the Basran Mu'tazila rather than as simply providing a paradigm for its expression, because he has not connected what they say with Wolfson's picture of the early Mu'tazilite objection to the attributes. What he quotes of them can still be interpreted in this light, for example (p. 12) "Ibn Kullab says that "the meaning of the statement 'God is knowing' is that an act of knowing belongs to Him" (lahu 'ilmun); that is to say, there is subsistent in Him (qa'imun bihi) an act of knowing by virtue of which He is said to be knowing." In the light of Wolfson's thesis we can see that the objections by abu 1-Hudhayl to this formulation stem from its proximity to the notion of multiplicity in the Creator (the Trinity) which had been espoused by the Greek Christians from whom the early Islamic scholars had learned their theology. 13 Wolfson, The Philosophy of the Kalam p. 25-26. Wolfson's translation brings out the subject more explicitly than that of Rosenthal Muqaddima III p. 48. 14 On this point there is some confusion, more about the difference between Ash'arism and Mu'tazilism than about Ibn Tumart. George Makdisi discusses the groups in contention in fifth century Baghdad in a two part article on "Ash'ari and the Ash'arites in Islamic Religious History" SI 17 (1962) pp. 37-81, 18 (1963) pp. 19-39. He concludes that too much has been made of the Ash'arite-Mu'tazilite conflict, and sees this as the result of an attempt on the part of Ash'arite historians (Subki et al.) to present themselves as enemies of Mu'tazilism and thereby to become more popular. The lines drawn between Ash'arite and Mu'tazilite on dif- ferent issues have been presented schematically by Louis Gardet and M. M. Anawati, Introduction d la thtologie musulmane, Paris: J. Vrin, 1948 pp. 58-59. Ibn Tumart has been called an Ash'arite by Abd al-Wahid al-Marrakushi, Kitab al- Mu'jib fi talkhis akhbar al-Maghrib, Dozy ed., Leiden 1881 p. 134, and by Ibn Khaldun, Histoire de Berbires transl. de Slane Paris 1925 Vol. I p. 252-3 Vol. II p. 164. Although I. Goldziher called Ibn Tumart an Ash'arite in his introduction to Le livre pp. 54-55 and pp. 79-80, in another article, "Materialien zur Kenntnis der Alhomadbewegung", ZDMG XLI (1887) pp. 82-3 he is of the opinion that Ibn Tumart was a Mu'tazilite: "Essentially, the founder of the Alhomad state was not a fully consequential Ash'arite, since only at the points where the teaching of al-Ash'ari differed from the Anthropomorphists did he stand on the ground of the Ash'arite school. In another principle question however, the answer to which framed the difference between the Ash'arite school and the Mu'tazilites; he is not a true follower of the Ash'arite teaching. I mean namely the teaching about the attributes of God. 'He declared', as a historian of the Alhomads relates, 'that he shared the doctrines of the school of Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari, with the exception of the admission of the attributes (in God) asifat since with regard to the negation of those same attributes and in other points he agreed generally with the Mu'tazilites.' ... We have now seen, that Ibn Tumart was no consequential follower of the Ash'arite system. Not only with regard to the doctrine of the Attributes does he part company from the school's teaching not in favor of the Mu'tazila but in the direction of the doctrine held by Ibn Hazm, but in addition to that the pantheistic-sounding parts on the symbols of the creed that he formulated built a partition between him and Ash'arism." 15 Quoted from "Une fetwa d'Ibn Taimiya sur Ibn Tumart", BIFAO LIX (1960) p. 181. Asin Palacios also considers Ibn Tumart a Mu'tazilite "Origen y caracter de la revoluci6n Alhomade" Obras Escogidas, Madrid: CSIS, 1948 p. 9.</page><page sequence="17">126 Madeleine Fletcher 16 As this early date al-Ghazali also prefers the Mu'tazilites over the Ash'arites, placing them nearter the truth in his book Mishkat al-Anwar Wensinck La pensie de Ghazali p. 11. 17 'Aqfda section 8, Le livre p. 233. Another section 10 which adds to this point "The Creator is necessarily Living, Knowing, Powerful, endowed with will, hearing and speach, all that without our conceiving how this is so. Other Ash'arite differences with the Mu'tazila are emphasized in the 'aqfda, in section 12, God's predestination and prescience as against Mu'tazilite Free Will. In section 15 God's names are mentioned as in the Murshida and Ibn Hazm's principle is quoted that "One does not name the Creator except by the way He has named Himself in His Book or by the language of His Prophet." 18 A. J. Wensinck, La pensee de Ghazali, Paris: Adrien-Maisonnueve, 1940 p. 13. Also p. 6 "The reasoning of Al-Ghazali is too related to a favorite idea of Neoplatonism for us to mistake the influence which it has had on our author. It is the idea of fundamental monism, excluding all plurality: the visible world, that is to say the whole of matter has only a secondary reality, the real reality being the exclusive prerogative of the One." 19 Cf. Emile Brehier, La Philosophie de Plotin, Paris: J. Vrin, 1968. The fact that this mystical experience is the essence of the philosophy of Plotinus is often overlooked because of the Plotinian school's implicit and explicit connections with the (entirely different) philosophy of Plato and Aristotle. For several centuries Muslim philosophers confused Plotinus with his Helenistic predecessors and con- sidered his philosophy to be "Aristotle's theology". 20 R. C. Zaehner, Hindu and Muslim Mysticism, New York: Schocken Books, 1969 gives a convincing analysis of the trance phenomenon in both Hinduism and Islam. It is entirely similar to the Christian via unitativa. 21 For example A. Huici, Historia politica del imperio almohade (Tetuan: Editora Marroqui, 1956) I p. 31: "Ibn Tumart is an extrovert, for whom divine love has no meaning; he is a man of faith, who gives his intelligence to the most sincere recognition of the grandeur and power of God, and at the same time a man of action, who only thinks of scrupulously obeying all the commands of an inacessible God without his heart participating at all in this faith and this devotion." We have already pointed out the evidence of the Murshida for Ibn Tumarts being an ecstatic mystic. Even without this evidence, the growing popularity of Sufism at that time and Ibn Tumart's condition of life-long celebacy in a religious environment would make it highly unlikely in any terms that he would not have indulged in mystical practises. 22 Le livre p. 234. There is a similar passage in the second murshida Le livre p. 241: "There is for Him neither before nor after, on top nor underneath, right nor left, in front nor behind, neither whole nor part." This shows that the statement is authentically that of Ibn Tumart, even though its placement in the 'aqfda may be from a later date. 23 E. Levi-Provengal, ed. Documents inidits d'histoire almohade, Paris: Paul Geuthner, 1928 pp. 4-5 translation, p. 7. 24 Of course anthropomorphism has its Neo-Platonic Christian expression in the doctrine of Incarnation which may be the source of the original oppositions to it. 25 The Moroccan traveler Ibn Batuta (1304-1369) quotes an anthropomorphist statement by the famous Hanbalite Taqi al-Din Ibn Taimiyya:</page><page sequence="18">The Almohad Tawhld 127 "I was in Damascus at the time and attended the service which [Ibn Taimiyya] was conducting one Friday, as he was addressing and admonishing the people from the pulpit. In the midst of his discourse he said, "Verily, God descends to the sky over our world [from heaven] in the same bodily fashion that I make this descent", and stepped down one side of the pulpit." Ibn Batuta, travels in Asia and Africa 1325-54 transl. H. A. R. Gibb, London: Routledge, 1929 pp. 67-68. But in Alexandria Ibn Taimiyya seems totally opposed to this stance, writing: "Whoever claims ... that [God] descends as I descend myself ... is an erring, vile being, a negator of the law-more I would say he was an infidel": Laoust "Unefetwa" p. 176. The simplistic idea that the Hanabalites remained totally literalist in their theology is challenged by the work of Merlin Swartz on Ibn al-Jawzi (d.1200) in his forthcoming edition of his book on the attributes, Akhbar al-Sifat. 26 Ibn Hawqal, Configuration de la terre [Kitab Surat al-Ard] transl. J. H. Kramers and G. Wiet, Paris: Maisonneuve, 1964 Vol. I p. 90. Ibn Hawqal, originally from Bagdad, may possibly have been a Fatimid spy and as such would have reason to compare the Malikites of the Sus region unfavorably with the Shiites. Nevertheless Cf Configuration introduction p. XII. 27 E. Levi Provencal ed., Docs inidits p. 4 translation, p. 6. 28 In the 'aqfda the negative definition is considerably shortened and lightened. 29 Quoted from Henri Laoust, "Une Fetwa d'Ibn Taimiya sur Ibn Tumart" BIFAO LIX (1960) pp. 177-8. It is interesting that Ibn Taimiyya uses his oppo- nent's rules catching them in a supposed logical incoherence. 30 The 'aqfda section four states the argument based on Aristotle's primum mobile: "By the first act, the existence of the Creator is recognized: the same as by the second and third to infinity. As for the heavens and the earth and the collectivity of created beings, one recognizes thanks to them the existence of the Creator; in the same way, His existence is recognized due to the contingency of the first move- ment, because this movement has necessarily need of an agent and because it is impossible for it to exist without an agent ..." Of course the 'aqfda, as we have said, is not necessarily Ibn Tumart's text. 31 Evidence for this universalist claim is to be found in Le livre . For example: "Chapter on the fact that tawhfd is the religion of the first and the last among the prophets and the messingers of God, and that the religion of the prophets is one." This is followed by a koranic question and 2 hadiths on same subject (Le livre p. 277).</page></plain_text>
