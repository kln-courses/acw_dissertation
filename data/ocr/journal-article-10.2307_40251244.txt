The example that follows is of an unfortunate case of mis-fit be- tween an academic building and its users- a mis-fit traceable to the uncom- promising adherence to its formal concep- tion, or parti.1 Such a mis-fit may result from a design philosophy that pays scant attention to human behavior or the envir- onment in which the building is placed. ACADEME July-August 1991 17</page><page sequence="3">Ultimately, design is the process of creating visual and user-unique environments. The parti is the con- ceptual birth of the unique. When the parti is strong and focused, the resulting building can become quite visually imageable. However, its very strength may mold more important issues, particularly those of human behavior, to fit the parti or may render them invisible altogether. Alternatively, when the parti is subordinated to such issues, the resulting building is usually subordinated to their practical demands. Such designs tend to take on banal com- positional rhythms or to offer a weak cornucopia of visual discomposition. Only rarely does a single building simultaneously reflect a strong visual parti and respond well to human behavior issues. Why the parti and the curriculum? Curricula de- termine the manifest and latent functions of the building. Manifest functions are the everyday or designed-for activities- teaching, research, public visitation. Many architects do not usually design for latent functions, but they do occur- socializing, taking time out between classes, eating. The suc- cess of any building depends on the mutual sup- port of one function for the other. If, during the design process, the architect does not fully understand these functions, a mis-fit will soon occur between the new building and its users. The beginning of the design process is what I call parti-getting, in which the architect brings to bear the full strength of his or her creative ener- gies. The remainder of the design process should reconcile the parti with the manifest and latent functions of the campus building. . ' nderis Hall has a strong design part i. Its loca- J tion on campus and its position of importance I in housing the Schools of Education, Social I Welfare, and Allied Health and eighteen other . _J programs at the University of Wisconsin-Mil- waukee makes it an ideal subject of analysis. En- deris is one of twenty-five major buildings on a 26,000-student campus. First called the General Building when it opened in the early 1970s, Enderis has eleven stories that contain some 182,000 square feet of space. Its grey- white concrete undulations can be seen from most locations on the campus. All buildings, including Enderis, begin with an architectural program. This written document usually describes in varying degrees of detail the goals of the client; a user profile; the required space, equipment, and furnishings; the relation- ships between spaces, their probable location, and the desired quality within them. It also sets up a budget and a schedule. Depending on the degree of completeness and the degree to which the archi- tect buys into it, the program establishes the tone and direction for the design. This makes it impera- tive that the architect be involved in its writing. When social spaces, such as lobbies, are provided within the building, the designs are usually so poor that they go unused. Josef Stagg is assistant professor in the School of Archi- tecture and Urban Planning at the University of Wiscon- sin-Milwaukee. 18 ACADEME July- August 1991</page><page sequence="4">The program for university buildings is prepared by an appointed programming committee. In itself, this is an excellent procedure, except that it often leaves the architect out. Consequently, many dis- crepancies between goals and the built form can be traced to this process. The parti is the second phase in the design pro- cess, and the first that the architect fully controls. Its creation can have the single most influential ef- fect on the final design of the building. It embod- ies the architect's psyche, personality, education, experience, skills, and talents. It usually begins with something the architect sees or hears during the programming stage. Another building, a meta- phor, something in the surrounding context, or even a melody can serve as the spark for the parti. The architect willing to fan such a spark can usually develop an excellent parti. Once the program is developed, the architect must come back to the client with preliminary sug- gestions on how the building should look and function. The program for Enderis Hall gave the architect license to develop a strong parti: . . .Rigid control is not a part of this process. . .It is obvious that a good building solution for one campus building cannot be copied and expected to work well on another The architect is encouraged to inno- vate. Design standards or clichés are to be substituted by professional, objective and subjective problem solv- ing approaches to building function and aesthetics. In the interest of architecture, the project architect is expected to generate and work within a climate of creativity. . . II I hile the rhythmic facade may invite other ■ /■/ frterprctations, Enderis Hall represents a ■J If strong geometric metaphor. The parti began llasa vertically elongated platonic solid: the I I cube. The cube was then slowly transformed through a series of ordered subtractions. A first- order subtraction occurs at the lower four corners of the building, leaving the top third of the cube in place. These subtractions are fortified by four V- shaped outer columns. Four inverted neoclassical pilasters remain after these subtractions. These columns defy perceptual order because neither ex- tends to the ground to help carry the weight of the top-heavy building. Other subtractions occur on the first and third through eighth floors. Windows conclude the subtractions, giving unity and visual imageability to the parti. The articulation phase is a process for transform- ing the conceptual parti into an actual design. Some of the more popular means of articulation rely upon economics, construction processes, and, of course, the strong will of the client. One of the more traditional processes, however, relies on prin- ciples of closure, continuity, proximity and similar- ity derived from Gestalt psychology. The signifi- cance of using this method is that the building's appearance becomes the priority, while its use and the user reaction to it become secondary. Thus, it is easy to see how mis-fit between building and curricula might take place. In the case of Enderis Hall, such a mis-fit definitely occurred. The extent of the problem may be assessed in several different areas of architectural concern. In developing the parti, the architect will evaluate the environment for compositional, detail, material, and other clues that might affect the design of the building. Some architects defy it, others emulate it, while still others compromise. Because the Milwau- kee campus was growing, the environment was in a constant state of flux. Context may have been discounted because, at the time, no one could pre- dict which buildings would be left standing. Thus, responding to temporal context would~have been ill-advised. Of the buildings standing when En- deris began, only Chapman to the west, Holton to the east, and Garland Hall across the street re- main. Nevertheless, for this reason or for other reasons, the Enderis parti totally defied context. The parti defied considerations of environment in several other respects as well. The Gestalt ap- proach to architecture is valued for its treatment of compositional elements such as scale and propor- tion, rhythm, and solids, voids, and massing in the facade. Scale is based on an average human fig- ure of six feet. Buildings that measure over six hu- man figures approach high-rise status. Of the three ACADEME July-August 1991 19</page><page sequence="5">buildings surrounding Enderis, none rises above six human figures. Enderis, by contrast, measures nearly twenty-four. Proportion is concerned with measuring ratios of height to width. Classical archi- tecture used the Golden Section, with its ecclesias- tical/anthropomorphic references, as one of several ideal proportioning systems. Buildings that emulate classical architecture like the three older ones sur- rounding Enderis employ such proportions to de- termine facade configurations. In the case of En- deris, no such lofty philosophical heights were reached. Enderis used a two-foot grid to set up facade proportions. The regular occurrence of patterns in the facade of the building constitutes its rhythm. In stark con- trast to its neighbors, Enderis uses the two-foot grid to establish a very static rhythm consisting of column, window, column, window, and so on. Solids, voids, and massing- the pushing-in and pulling-out of facade elements- are used on the Enderis parti, creating a rhythm of solids and voids. In contrast, the older buildings surrounding it used additive transformation, in which they be- gan with a large primary form and added other forms to it to complete the parti. Details are deco- rations and ornaments added onto the building to achieve a desired visual effect or to complete an ar- chitectural style. The eclectic styles of the older buildings rely upon such decorations. Enderis does not. In fact, as with the earlier International or Modern style of architecture it emulates, Enderis Hall eschewed decorations and ornaments altogether. Classical composition theory insists upon material compatibility. Most universities, in their attempt to preserve their original collegiate environments, will generally insist that new building material fit well with existing ones. The reddish-brown 2"x4"x8// fired-clay brick was the standard material for the older campus buildings. Almost all of the other new buildings used brick in their facades. Enderis did not. Instead, it set another standard- emulated by some of the subsequent designs- with its smooth skin of gray- white concrete. Traditional design principles dictate that the ap- proach to a building be intriguing yet straightfor- ward. There are four major axes of approach to Enderis. An auditorium blocks the eastern axis. The northern, western, and southern axes of ap- proach, while not intriguing, are straightforward. Similarly, tradition dictates that the building entry be dominant yet inviting. To achieve dominance, the major entryway must rise high on the elevation or otherwise dominate it. Because of the eleven- story height of Enderis, this is impossible. How- ever, all three entrances are made inviting through traditional means of subtracting the solid elements surrounding them. Buildings of this type require a lobby where entrants can make destination choices. The lobby is well-placed according to the three axes of approach to the building. As we will see later, however, the lobby of Enderis Hall is not ideal. who emphasize the visual part- as it Architects is so conspicuously emphasized in Enderis Hall- are usually referred to as formalists. Those who concern themselves with human behavior are called behaviorists. The domi- nance of formalism, unquestioned before the 1960s, is now being challenged by environmentally and behaviorally oriented research techniques. Recent works have focused, for instance, on co-housing for single parents and design of homes for elderly people with dementia. The most useful research tool to emerge from this new field is the Post-Occupancy Evaluation (POE). The POE is used to study the fit between building and user. The intensity of the analysis varies according to the goals of the researcher. The least intense- the walk-through POE- is used to explore problems of fit. The diagnostic POE studies multiple aspects of the building in an attempt to establish causal relationships. Do people remember one building more than an- other? Why? Donald Appleyard has said that peo- ple do not necessarily remember a building because of its architectural manipulations or for its design uniqueness. Instead, they remember a building be- cause of its location in relation to transportation routes; its use or function; the amount of move- ment in and around the building; and its massing and size relative to its surrounding context. Enderis Hall would seem to pass the test on all four counts. It lies along one of the most traveled campus routes. It houses several of the more pop- ular curricula on campus, drawing a constant stream of users. Finally, it stands out because of its mass and size. Furthermore, it appears to meet other criteria for public success. Kevin Lynch' s book, The Image of the City, sug- gested that public preference for environmental differentiation is keen and specific. There is a de- sire to have one or more buildings stand out from the rest of the environment. Such buildings help users find their way around both the complex and the homogeneous environments. Enderis Hall is starkly different from its context, making it a very imageable building. Nevertheless, my walk-through evaluation sug- gested a generally negative tone toward Enderis. A typical comment was, "It's ugly. . .1 much prefer the red-brick buildings next door." Amos Rapoport and others asked whether build- ings hold the same meaning for the architect and the non-architect. In general, the answer is no. Ar- chitects tend to define buildings along cognitive lines. They take a building apart and analyze it pretty much as I did earlier. "Good" or "bad" meaning is determined, in part, by how well the building stands up to that analysis. The public, on the other hand, experiences buildings from the gut and generally expresses this in terms of likes and dislikes. This affective reaction goes beyond the mostly visual response of the architect. Although visual quality is important, smells, textures, sur- roundings, people, and many other subjective is- 20 ACADEME July-August 1991</page><page sequence="6">sues contribute to the meaning attached to build- ings by non-architects. However, when confronted with Enderis Hall, architects and non-architects find a way to agree. Both dislike the building. formalist designer of a high-rise would usually create a core in the center of the plan, containing both a lobby and the elevator and stairs, bringing entrants to them through large promenades leading from the main entrances. This was not done in Enderis Hall. The lobby was placed on the western end of the square floor plan while the elevators and stairs were placed closer to the plan center. A small corridor leads from the lobby to the elevators. Those placements are the beginning of the confusion that builds up on the upper floors. This makes wayfinding difficult in Enderis Hall. The handicapped or less-than-able make up a large portion of the entrants to Enderis Hall. In general, physical access was not found to be a problem. However, accessibility does become a problem beyond the lobby because, like all en- trants, the less-than-able must find the elevators. The first-time visitor cannot see them immediately upon entering the lobby. Earlier I briefly discussed manifest and latent functions, following the work of R.K. Merton. Oddly enough, when we dichotomize behavior in campus spaces along these lines, we find that most of the work has been done on the latter. Research dealing with manifest functions (sitting in the classroom, listening to a lecture, or writing in one's office) suggests that task performance and job satisfaction are affected by ambient conditions and the physical layout of spaces. Ambient condi- tions, such as uncomfortable room temperature, stuffy air quality, lack of natural light, loud colors, and surrounding noise all negatively affect mani- fest functions. On the other hand, room size, the presence and arrangement of furniture and equip- ment, and supporting facilities affect both task per- formance and job satisfaction. Satisfaction with office and classroom space in Enderis is low because of lack of windows and un- comfortable temperatures due to window place- ment. A particular problem with the design of En- deris is that- with most classrooms confined to the core of the building- many classrooms have no windows at all! (Of course, faculty members are proverbially hard to satisfy. As one professor said to me, "No matter how much space I have, it will never seem to me that I have enough.") Enderis Hall has proven particularly inhospitable to those latent functions, involving socializing and other unplanned activities, that are so important to the success of a building at the level of human be- havior. Gerald Weisman and others have con- cerned themselves with how users find their way around buildings. The research suggests that the floor plan configuration should be made simple to enhance wayfinding. Architectural features should be differentiated from hallway to hallway and from floor to floor. The use of signage- something archi- tects abhor- should be permitted to ensure ease of wayfinding. Finally, visual access to one's final destination should be given to decrease the stress of wayfinding. Upon leaving the lobby of Enderis Hall, beware. The hallways are long and are ringed by- and themselves ring- large banks of class- rooms. There are no distinguishing features either in the hallways or from floor to floor- save for the small personalized places outside doorways. One could conceivably wander the hallways forever. Power factors come into play about spatial alloca- tion of office space. Office size, location, and the presence of windows are related to the power hier- archy. In Enderis, allocation is crucial since the many inner offices have no view of the outside, making them the least-desired. Massive buildings like Enderis Hall can never be configured to fit the required privacy patterns of those who work in them. Many of the offices are shared, making vis- ual and aural privacy virtually impossible. Those sharing offices try to achieve privacy by placing fil- ing cabinets and other items between themselves and their office-mates. Our walk-through POE raised questions of ther- mal comfort. The design of the windows of Enderis Hall is clearly parti-related. For instance, the archi- tect chose to maintain a similar design on all four faces of the building, despite the fact that heat col- lects on the east and west in the morning and eve- ning hours. Consequently, staff in those offices on those facades experience discomfort throughout the year. One of the most important latent functions, informal socializing, is probably the least under- stood and therefore the least designed-for in a building such as ours. When social spaces, such as lobbies, are provided within the building, the de- signs are usually so poor that they go unused. Out of scale with its neighbors, relentless in ful- filling its own parti, Enderis Hall has plainly not been a success from the viewpoint of human needs, and especially those informal needs that constitute the latent functions of the building. My aims were to show how such mis-fits are likely to occur when a building is designed with one approach- whether it be the formalist or the behaviorist- in mind. An ideal fit can be achieved only when both approaches are joined. ■ NOTE 1. From its first meeting in 1671 to its closing in 1968, the Ecole des Beaux-Arts of Paris, one of the first organized schools of architectural education, used the parti as a means of begin- ning all building design. During the school's almost three hun- dred years of existence, Beaux-Arts students were given a pro- gram and confined en loge for twelve to twenty-four hours to develop the parti. The program dictated the use of classic or neoclassic precedents such as a Greek temple or Baroque cathe- dral to develop an original floor plan concept. Elevation or fa- cade design was to reflect the proportions, details, and materials of the classic or neoclassic style then popular among professors. Depending on the level of the student, subsequent months were reserved for the transformation of the parti into design, using education, experience, and the selected prece- dents as the articulating force.
