Revised May 2013) ABSTRACT In this paper I describe an unusual triad of images from the northern Cederberg, Western Cape. The probable origin of their subject matter is implied by the depicted morphological features. While their heads are distinctly anthropomorphic, nothing else invokes the humanoidform. Their identification is sought elsewhere, outside the mammalian kingdom. Even though a few traits suggest insectiforms, these are too few to be useful in identifying exact species. Nevertheless, the most likely generic candidate is identified, which offers the potential for interpreting these images by assembling multifarious and nuanced readings of possible San ethnographic correlations. Keywords: Agter-Pakhuis area, insectiforms, Odonata, San belief, stars. ENCOUNTER WITH RARE ELONGATED PAINTED FORMS San rock art abounds with rare and cryptic depictions, the significance of which is often perplexing. Although the bulk of the tradition is well known and, even more so, well interpreted across southern Africa (see Lewis-Williams 2006), it is also true that there remain unknown numbers of sites to be discovered. Inevitably, some of these sites will reveal subject matter never seen previously. With diligence and luck, statements may be found in San ethnographies that permit the interpretation of peculiar images. Even so, unique images present a problem that concerns two related aspects: first, their elusive identifica tion and, second, the dearth of ethnographic information regarding their meaning. Is it feasible, then, to proceed to an interpretation when the ethnography is silent on such pecu liarities? From a methodological standpoint, there are familiar difficulties with interpreting idiosyncratic imagery when there is no relevant ethnographic information. In this case, persuasive interpretation may be unattainable. As a contrast to this view, it can be argued that it is possible to say something about rare images on the basis of the now well-understood San art imagery, the operation of their oral/pictorial metaphors, San normative depiction principles (Mguni 2004), recognisable postures and, importantly, the now well-known San beliefs about the spirit world and other supernatural features. In the case of unusual imagery, the ethnography may offer indirect connections to inform us on their meaning. It is thus reasonable to examine correlations between subtle artistic signals and ethnographic information across various categories of subject matter. Later, I argue that such interpretative obliquity comes from an indirect conceptual link between one subject with ethnographic support, and another (its abstract counter part), without such interpretative support. My main objective, however, is to report a unique set of images from a small shelter in the northern Cederberg, Western Cape (Fig. 1). After the ini tial appraisal of these images, I attempt to identify the subject matter and to explore, briefly, their meaning. OBSERVING AND RECORDING THE PAINTED IMAGES The initial challenge in the field concerned the recording of the images. Because the paintings at the site are faded, I decided to trace all the visible images. Even for small panels such as this one, tracing is a complex and very time-consuming necessity that captures even the finest and most faded details. Whereas these details are often invisible in photography, they are crucial to image analysis. Tracing this site involved four differently timed day visits, spanning a total of three days. As a result, it was possible to discern specific minutiae of individual images and their likely relationships, all of which were not perceptible on the first visit when the site was discovered. Whereas portions of the panel have weathered, leaving only a discoloured friable surface alongside earlier images that have now faded beyond recognition, the set presented here is on a relatively stable surface. The tracing procedure, made using conservation-friendly methods and materials, ensured that even the miniscule details were captured accurately (for more information on this tech nique, see Loubser &amp; Den Hoed 1990). Since the purpose of the recording was to permit the identification and interpretation of these images, scattered smudges and remnants of pigment were omitted as unusable vestiges. The final redrawing from this tracing was produced to form the foundation of this analysis (see Fig. 5 later in the paper). Even though comprehensive analytical observation of entire panels on single sites is not as common as general regional approaches, such methods are becoming increasingly popular in southern Africa (e.g. Hollmann 2001; Lewis-Williams &amp; Pearce 2004; Malien 2005; Lewis-Williams &amp; Hollmann 2006; Lewis Williams 2008,2009). While this approach facilitates a rigorous examination of imagery and other site features, there can be a problem of scale and sample size. How typical, for example, are the conclusions drawn from a single site to a wider geograph ical range? THE SITE AND THE PAINTINGS The nine images that I describe come from a small, hemispheroidal shelter about 1.3 m high and 1.6 m across. The overhang is an 80 cm north-facing protrusion. Rock shelters in this region formed in quartzitic sandstones of the Table Moun tain Supergroup. It is typical for these sedimentary rocks to weather along faults and other structural weaknesses, causing blocks to disintegrate into distinctive overhangs and formations. Freshly exposed surfaces weathered, smoothed, and discoloured over time thus were favoured by prehistoric painters. The painted surface is tucked under one of the larger rocks set within a jumble of rust-coloured and heavily weathered quartzite boulders (Fig. 2). These freestanding rocks, some resting against each other, are assembled on a low sandstone ridge that stretches for nearly 60 m along an east-west axis. The floor of the shelter is a flat rocky surface which has been ground smooth in two places. Although meagre soil exists within large</page><page sequence="2">South African Archaeological Bulletin 68 (198): 160-172,2013 161 FIG. 1.

No more than four people can shelter at a time inside this alcove. No other paintings are in the immediate vicinity, even though other potentially suitable overhangs exist. Beyond the sparse rubble of rocks strewn on the surface, about 3 m east of the shelter, there is a large reservoir that weathering has sunk into the sandstone (Fig. 3). There is no vegetation on the ridge, but adjacent to its flanks are two minor, ephemeral streams where a variety of largely annual fynbos species grow seasonally. At micro-scale this site is not visually dramatic, but, when stepping back into its surroundings and gazing into the distance, an immediate appreciation of the spectacularly wide vistas is experienced. The section of the rock face with the paintings overlooks the pool immediately in front and to the east of the shelter and also a portion of the elevated mountainous panorama to the north. Although generally faded, there are a few decipherable images in red. They include a female figure, three thin elon gated figures, three patches of pigment and two faint antelope. Scattered areas of red pigment are indecipherable remnants of images; they were omitted in the recording. It appears that the present set of images may have been executed as an episode (see definition in Lewis-Williams 1992), over an older painting surface. Panels with only remnants of images are common in the Western Cape (Yates et al. 1985). I now describe each one of the nine images, from left to right along the painted surface. Whilst photographs render both the colour and ambience of rock art sites, there is generally little at this site that is visible for precise observations based on them alone (Fig. 4). After all, photographs may in some cases be misleading (Lewis-Williams et al. 1986). Some digital photographic processing techniques such as Jon Harman's open-source DStretch plug-in to ImageJ programme (Harman 2009), or image-manipulation toolsets such as CPED (Hollmann &amp; Crause 2011), can enhance faded images and thereby make them visible. However, my experi ence with tracing, which relies on the naked eye, is that it often enforces the tracer's engagement with imagery and other asso ciations on the rock face. The redrawing of the images shows their fine details better than the photographs. Leftmost on the panel's wash zone, is a painting of a 14-cm-tall, solitary hook-headed woman. With a tasselled bag under one arm, she holds a short stick across the shoulder. Below the hand clutch ing the stick, two breasts, one above the other (a common San painting convention for females) are clearly depicted. Immedi ately above the breasts there are two further faded narrower ovate accessories that resemble the shape and anterior orienta tion of breasts. Two thin near-parallel lines appear to drop down from each of the breasts and then terminate next to the woman's knees. It is possible that these were originally longer and even connected to other painted features that are no longer visible. Farther (42 cm) right from the woman, is an enigmatic figure 56 cm in height (Fig. 4A). Like the woman, this figure has a hook-head and faces towards her. Below its head, where breasts would be expected for a female, there are two faint attachments, one above the other, protruding below the back of the figure's head. From the figure's prominently curved back a little further down, this evenly thin body (less than 5 mm wide) continues downwards in a near-vertical trajectory. Still farther along its length, there are a series of 26 spiky projections, each</page><page sequence="3">162 South African Archaeological Bulletin 68 (198): 160-172, 2013 FIG. 2.

The enigmatic figures and other associated images on variously coloured surfaces. monious: often rare subjects have no diagnostic features. It must be recalled that the motivation and intention in this graphic tradition was not to conceal the identity of the depictions. Some subjects are unrecognisable to outsiders today, but not to the artis. contemporaries. The depiction of the real contours and details of the subject was not necessary in San depictive principles (Mguni 2005, 2009). It has been argued that San artists worked with metaphors and vision experiences rather than with reality (Lewis-Williams et al. 1986). Yet the heads on all three elongated figures are of the usual type: complete circular blobs or concave- and hook-shapes (from which the FIG. 5. The redrawing of the whole panel containing peculiar images. lighter pigmented facial portions have faded) (Yates et al. 1985; Lewis-Williams &amp; Dowson 1999). On the basis of their apparently human heads, I consider these figures to be anthropomorphic forms of some kind. I also observe that, however superficial, these Cederberg images recall three figures in the Drakensberg, which are similarly thin and elongated but whose arms and upper torsos are incontro vertibly human (Fig. 6). These Drakensberg examples, at 67 cm long, are in the size range of the Cederberg images. They have been argued to be "the most striking depiction of attenuation ... and clearly trance dancers" (Lewis-Williams &amp; Dowson</page><page sequence="5">164 South African Archaeological Bulletin 68 (198): 160-172,2013 1999:77), because their arms are in typical dance postures. If the Cederberg images are indeed partly anthropomorphic, a further assumption can be made that Fig. 4C possesses protuberances that might be human, probably breasts. But the other two figures have similar traits that undermine this mammary reading. If these are breasts, a usually diagnostic trait for images of women, they are positioned on the wrong side of the body, as judged from the orientation of the hook-head on the leftmost figure. Accordingly, these appendages are possibly something other than breasts. Are they perhaps some other feature, such as arms? While the position might be correct for the arms-back posture, the forms are slightly stout and ovate to be human arms. Could they be wings of some kind? The figures do not resemble birds, but arthropods. After all, there are San depic tions of various winged insects and their nests and similar structures (Pager 1971a, 1973; Mguni 2002, 2005). If these are wings of some kind of insect, then the range of potential candi dates might be found within the localised biosphere forming the site surrounds. The fynbos region, of which the Western Cape is part, is rich in insect fauna (Wright &amp; Samways 1998). The Cederberg mountains, though relatively arid, are dissected by streams and rivers, some of which are perennial bases supporting an immensely diverse biota. Deep in the mountains, the ravines often trickle all year with water from the springs. Pools form in large depressions in the rocks. These retain water for several months after the wet season, thus rendering the environment favourable for insect fauna. From an initial assessment of the body form, appendages and posture of the three enigmatic figures a few possibilities emerge: 'ringed-worms' whose mem bers include earthworms (Annelida), stick insects (Phasmatodea), mayflies (Ephemeroptera), antlions and lacewings (Neuroptera), caddisflies (Trichoptera), hangingflies (Mecoptera), craneflies (Díptera), mantids (Mantodea) and the related insects in the order Odonata, i.e., damselflies (Zygoptera) and dragonflies (Anisoptera). This is a vast range of insects: there are literally tens of thousands of species and to wade through all their FIG. 6.

Image from RARI archives. multifarious manifestations would be pointless. I therefore select typical morphological forms (Fig. 7) and match them with painted images. Besides their elongated bodies, there is nothing to link the images to earthworms. By contrast, the possibility of a match FIG. 7. The enigmatic images show features which mirror the dragonfly morphology.

They have long spindly legs and elongated abdo mens, which in most species retain a meagre semblance of wings. Their antennae are also exceptionally long. But the three images have no indication of these features. Moreover, two of them feature spikes, or hairy filaments, on their lower bodies and bifurcated ends, all of which lack correlates in stick insects. What of the mayflies which swarm in their thousands in the Western Cape and Namaqualand slightly farther north during certain seasons? In this area, they are called the 'September brown' because they appear at this time along the banks of stony mountain streams (Skaife 1997). While their abdomens are short and slightly stout, it is their antennae and tail filaments, rather like long tendrils, which are diagnostic (Attenborough 2005). Although these features could have been used to define mayflies in the paintings, the images in question lack them. For that reason, the images probably do not depict mayflies. Antlions, alongside the related lacewings, seem to match the images, but only because of their long and slender abdo mens. Antlions have prominent, apically clubbed antennae which are about as long as their heads and thoraxes combined, and long and narrow wings which enclose the abdomens. If one assumes that this insect was depicted here, at least some of these defining traits should be reflected. The images do not possess these distinctive features, thus antlions are probably not the subject. Similarly, the other possible insects including caddisflies, hangingflies, craneflies and even the ethnographi cally distinguished mantids all have prominent features such as very long forelimbs (among the mantids these are peculiarly modified for seizing and holding prey), long antennae, large wings and often stout abdomens that are dissimilar from the depicted figures. So, what of the species in the order Odonatal Odonata comprises damselflies and dragonflies, which to gether account for 11 families in South Africa. Out of these, seven are damselflies and four dragonflies. Although damsel flies are generally smaller and more slender than dragonflies, these two groups are outwardly similar, save for minor diver gences. Their wing positions at rest are particularly revealing (damselflies hold their wings together above their backs, whereas dragonflies stretch theirs out perpendicular to the body, horizontally or occasionally slightly down and forward). Moreover, the dragonfly back wing broadens near the base while those of the damselfly are both similar. There are other subtle variances, such as the eye structure, the varying size and shape of their antennae (in dragonflies considerably reduced), and even on certain intricate traits pertaining to their larval stages. From all recognisable subjects in this body of art, it appears that San artists generally focused on noticeable, diag nostic external subject morphology. It is possible that these two biologically related insects may have been invoked in tandem in the art because of their observable resemblances (and so potentially were regarded as indistinguishable). However, there is no evidence that the San upheld this closeness. Instead, as we shall see, they perceived a connection between the unre lated dragonfly and antlion. This connection is evident in the San names of dragonflies and antlions that I now discuss. In/Xam taxonomy, ¿Kakkeri-Okho-tünu (n.) is the name for both the common Cape dragonfly and the short-horned antlion (Palpares speciosus, the large spotted-wing antlion, common in many parts of Africa), while the Kalahari Auen over a thousand kilometres away similarly use the name Zebbizebbi (n.) for both dragonflies and antlions (Bleek 1956: 264, 655). The Palpares species, which are large with 11.2 cm wingspans, are often found on mountains (Picker et al. 2004) like the Cederberg. The other southern Kalahari group, !Ko San, who were extensively studied by Hans Heinz, name all dragonflies n/ah/i, although it is unclear whether this term includes antlions (Heinz 1978: 151). The etymology of these San words is obscure. Neverthe less, we are as puzzled as Heinz (ibid.) was by the fact that these collective San names do not always combine subjects which clearly have common morphological features. Whereas these names do not conflate dragonflies and damselflies, which scientists classify as evidently close biological relatives, there is a central clue which offers analogous symbolism between the dragonfly and another insect form a will become clear later. It is conceivable that the associations that influenced San nomen clature may also have been based on other particulars, such as the common behaviour of the subjects and the people's beliefs rather than morphology alone. The long slender bodies of the three images suggest Odonata abdomens. For example, the dragonfly abdomen is always narrow and stretched in comparison with its breadth. Its most primitive form comprised a fairly narrow elongated cylinder, lacking either constrictions or expansions (Tillyard 1917), an approximate form retained in most current species. In some species, the abdomen has become excessively slender, and of enormous length, as a secondary development related to the habit of laying eggs in the water (ibid.). In other species, the third abdominal segment is strongly constricted, especially in males, whereas the distal segments of female abdomens are considerably distended. Generally, the female body is notice ably stouter than that of the male, owing to their elongated ovaries. The upper bodies of the elongated figures have conspicuous double attachments that appear to invoke the paired flexible wings of dragonflies rather than mammarian protuberances or arms. Dragonflies possess two pairs of well-developed wings, the fore-wings (on the mesothorax) and the hind-wings (on the metathorax), of either equal or slightly unequal size. They are actually elongated membranous outgrowths attended by a network of veins (Tillyard 1917). These traits are visible in their larval stages as swellings resembling tiny buds which project upwards and a little inwards. As the instars grow, these buds or flaps (now called the wing-sheaths, -cases, -pads or -folds) also continue to grow. The hind wing-sheaths eventually overlap the fore, until only a narrow strip along the costal border of each is visible. Simultaneously, the direction of the sheaths turns backwards so that they end up lying straight along and over the abdomen reaching the end of the fourth segment or beyond (ibid.). The hind wing sheaths become deeply pigmented while the fore-wing sheaths (owing to their being covered by the hind) remain very weakly pigmented or coloration is absent altogether. This point may partly explain the portrayal on the elongated bodies of the rock art images of the dual and ovate-shaped appendages, which might be wings - being habitually held nearly perpendicular to the body - depicted in side view. With this detail, how can it be ascertained that dragonflies (and not damselflies) are what the artist/s had in mind? To answer this question, one needs to probe deeper using a formal analysis of the images in relation to these possible natural parallels. One can then consider an emic appraisal of what the artist/s believed about the dragonflies. The tricky part of this approach is that such idiosyncratic depictions often lack ethnographic correlates. Even when rare subjects are mentioned in San ethnographies, there is not much material to support interpretations for individual paintings. Could this ethnographic silence on some rare natural subjects be a result of the San paying little or no attention to these subjects?</page><page sequence="7">166 South African Archaeological Bulletin 68 (198): 160-172,2013 FIG. 8. Bifurcated abdomens on the attenuated figures are similar to common examples of several dragonfly species, particularly forms in D-E. Images redrawn from Tillyard (1917). SAN ENTOMOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE The San, unlike taxonomists today, lacked the observa tional tools to distinguish numerous features of many species. For instance, how could they possibly know that in addition to the male dragonfly's penis near the tip of its abdomen there are further secondary reproductive organs, the luminae and humule (Tarboton &amp; Tarboton 2002), located ventrally on the sternite of the second and third segments of the abdomen? This is not the expected locus or even function of insect genitalia. Or the fact that male mayflies, like their female counterparts, lack mouths as they have no need for food during their short life span of a few hours, but that they, peculiarly, have two penises? It is therefore not expected that San artists would have noted for depiction all the finely detailed features of the biological entities which catch the attention of biologists. Besides, an undeviating portrayal of the chosen subject was not, as far as can be ascertained, the focus of their depictive purposes (Mguni 2004). As Harald Pager once argued: "Naturalistic appearance was almost invariably sacrificed in favour of the depictions of basic concepts and essentials" (Pager 1971a: 323; 1971b: 32-33). From this basic axiom, we can identify not only those diagnostic traits which the artists used to delineate the subject economi cally, but also understand some crucial meaningful characteris tics of the subject matter which informed their symbolic significance. There are still outstanding traits on the images that need to be explained: on two of these elongated figures there are serial spikes on their rear portions and bifurcated attachments at the end of their slender bodies. When damsel flies and dragonflies are observed further, damselflies appear to have less prominent traits that can be linked to these last two features. BIFURCATION ON THE ABDOMEN I showed earlier that two of the attenuated figures have bifid tips on their abdomens. While numerous insects have similar appendages, dragonflies possess a remarkable array of traits shown in the images. As described in one of the definitive early biological texts on Odonata, their abdomens consist of ten complete and very distinct segments at the extreme end of which is a set of anal appendages (Tillyard 1917). Males have two superior appendages developed from the posterior end of the tenth tergite, which are broad leaf-like processes in some species. Below and between them but lying directly above the anus, is the inferior appendage developed from the reduced tergite of the eleventh segment (Fig. 8). These are absent in females, although superior appendages exist, functionless, and much smaller than in the males. While the inferior appendage on some species is strongly bifid with short superiors, in others it is trifid and very long, attended by very short superiors. The positions of these appendages and vestigial structures fulfil the</page><page sequence="8">South African Archaeological Bulletin 68 (198): 160-172,2013 167 FIG. 9. Male dragonfly anal appendages used to grip females during mating on the left. The middle picture shows these appendages during the final larval stage prior to pupation while those on the right are shown after pupation. Images redrawn from Tillyard (1917). Photographs reproduced with permission of Warwick Tarboton (http://www.warwicktarboton.co.za/Dragonfly%20list.html). gripping function for males to grasp the females firmly during mating. This feature, possibly shown from the lateral position (Fig. 9), makes the two attenuated figures most likely male dragonflies. A consideration of details of this act will help us understand aspects that informed the symbolism of this insect form. During mating, which varies marginally in different species, the inferior appendage is pressed down upon the female occiput, while the superior appendages become engaged etween the prothorax and the back of the head (Tillyard 1917). To achieve this, the male flies directly at the female to grab her in mid-air with his legs, then arches his abdomen forward to fasten his appendages - also called claspers - around her neck in a gripping action (Tillyard 1917; Samways &amp; Whiteley 1997; Tarboton &amp; Tarboton 2002; Attenborough 2005). The pair then flies in tandem, the male leading and the female trailing, until they start to mate in the familiar 'wheel position'. Oviposition may occur immediately while the pair remains in tandem, but often females are released to continue with egg-laying either in plant material or directly into the water (Tillyard 1917; Alcock 1987; 1990; Samways &amp; Whiteley 1997). Ovipositing females re peatedly dip or strike their abdomen tips in the water (Alcock 1987). In so doing they wash off the steady flow of exuding egg masses into the water. Some species in the genus Cordulephya actually dive down into the water to lay eggs (Tillyard 1917: 227). As I show shortly, such behaviours are significant indica tors of the association these insects might have with the spirit world. SERIAL SPINES ON THE ABDOMEN We have seen that the same two figures with bifid abdo mens also have serial spiky forms on the lower portions of their bodies. When we look at the dragonfly, a few possible deriva tions of this bristling turn out to be promising. First, dragonflies possess sensory hairs with a tactile function on many parts of the body, such as the antennae (less pronounced as the dragon fly depends largely on its very keen eyesight), the legs, the abdomen, the anal appendages, and the wing-sheaths of larvae (Tillyard 1917). It appears that the composite features of both dragonflies and their larvae were conflated in these paintings. The larvae of most species are covered in body hairs. Another possible derivation is found on the Labellulidae or 'percher' dragonfly family, in the form of lateral abdominal gills that are prominent on aquatic larvae. These occur on either side of most abdominal segments as lateral spines (Samways &amp; Whiteley 1997). Their position is distinctly ventral as remnants of true, serially paired abdominal appendages. In shape they are slender filaments whose internal structure is marked by extreme atten uation. This feature is also prevalent on some larval forms (Fig. 10) where these are actual dorsal spines on the abdomens (ibid.). These too may have been observed by the artists who would have been aware of the lifecycle of this insect. In sum, the dragonfly possesses remarkable traits, which would not have gone unnoticed by the San. Dragonflies have the keenest sight of any insect in their phylum, which may be linked to their largely aerial existence. They seem to depend less on other senses such as touch, which partially explains their fairly small antennae. Their aeronautical abilities are extraordinary in the insect world; they are one of the fastest flying insects with the capacity to travel at over 60 km an hour; they will hover, fly backwards as well as forwards or even vertically upwards as well as downwards. They can flap each wing independently, which gives them extraordinary aerial manoeuvrability during hunting; they swoop, then scoop and devour their prey on the wing (Attenborough 2005). Further more, no order except the Lqaidoptera can surpass the Odonata in the beauty, variety and brilliancy of their coloration. Though unlike Lepidoptera where all coloration occurs on the wings, Odonata not only possess brilliantly-coloured wings but have developed unequalled body coloration (Tillyard 1917). These colours, however, do not really exist as pigments, but are pro duced by the interference of light reflected at the two surfaces of the double wing layer, or by combined refraction and reflec tion of light falling on a body area pigmented in a special manner</page><page sequence="9">168 South African Archaeological Bulletin 68 (198): 160-172,2013 PAINTED FORMS u VARIOUS SPECIES: ODONATA This is larvae of the Libellulidae species BODY HAIRS: Such hairs on some species cover the whole body, in others, only tufts are found on the abdomen tips and the legs. lateral SPINES: This feature is absent on some species or moderate in size but in others such spines are quite large and strong. - y MID-DORSAL SPINES: On some species this feature is present but absent in others. * "^rmr A B C D E F The illustrations A-F show a variety of accessory forms or secondary genitalia with spiny and hairy features around them in various dragon fly species. FIG. 10. Hairy and spiny features of dragonflies and their larvae may explain similar spines and bifurcation on the three painted images. Images redrawn from Tillyard (1917) and Samways and Whiteley (1997). (ibid.). If the wing does not have pigmentation, the interference coloration takes the form of iridescence, a kind of subtle rain bow effect varying with the angle of vision. In all Odonata, this is visible after pupation in their freshly-formed wings, which may be due to the presence of a liquid layer between the two wing membranes. As soon as the wing dries, the two wing membranes fuse, and the iridescence gives place to hyalinity (a glass-like appearance), in which no interference effects are usually visible. In other species, however, the mature wings retain their iridescence. This quality of brilliant coloration on dragonflies and the obvious lack of it on antiions, a similar insect, may have been noteworthy for San observers and may explain the united San nomenclature for the dragonfly and antlion. RELATIONSHIPS AND ASSOCIATIONS IN THE PAINTING CONTEXT The distinctive postures and features that I have described are in part explicable in terms of San beliefs and cosmology. First, the elongated hook-headed figure on the far left is in a bending forward posture. Even if not exactly as it appears in the art, the male dragonfly as already noted, assumes a curved posture, arching his abdomen forward once he pounces on a female to get his claspers into a firm grip on the female's head (Fig. 9). Second, even more prominently, the females too exhibit this 'arched-abdomen' posture when laying eggs (Fig. 11). During oviposition the female curves her abdomen down wards into the water to avoid attracting attention and distur bance from lurking males. Finally, as the dragonfly transforms by emerging from its larval skin, it too adopts a similar posture (Fig. 11). This posture is strongly associated with the dragonfly; I explore the significance shortly. The dragonfly is airborne most of its life, hunting for prey or mates, mating or laying eggs. As with all other insects, dragonflies need warm wing muscles before they can fly. On cool mornings, the larger species vibrate their wings in order to attain optimal temperatures of around 20°C, while smaller species bask in the sun to warm their bodies (May 1976; Samways &amp; Whiteley 1997). This wing-vibration behaviour is significant among some Kalahari San, who con sider 'vibrating' a vital comportment of healing (Katz 1982; Keeney 2003). For the/Xam, 'to vibrate' or 'vibration' are concepts that connote sounds "associated with sorcerers and sorcery" in their mythology about stars (Hollmann 2004: 248), but are also linked with trance performance and healing. The presence of the woman, farthest on the left of the panel (Figs 4 &amp; 5), is not coincidental. She has two appendages above her breasts which mimic the paired forms on the three enigmatic figures, possibly as a graphic link between them. Her breasts have two near-parallel vertical lines emanating from near their tips and dangling to her knees. While these lines may indicate aspects of lactation (much as lines from armpits might indicate sweat (Yates et al. 1985), they may also represent the San concept of 'threads of light' (Lewis-Williams et al. 2000). Similar double lines have been noted in the same locality asso ciated with two men dancing in front of three clapping women indicating trance potency (Yates et al. 1985). Further, there are three red pigment patches, one of which is rubbed smooth. These tempered areas of pigment are significant in this associa tion as they imply interfaces between the natural and the spirit worlds (Yates &amp; Manhire 1991). Altogether these images, including the elongated figures farthest on the right, place the entire panel in the symbolic focus which, as I argue, is most likely inspired by the life cycle of the dragonfly. Certain features and postures of the attenuated figures suggest that the most obvious concepts are probably related to the sexual organs and mating behaviour of the dragonfly. We</page><page sequence="10">South African Archaeological Bulletin 68 (198): 160-172,2013 169 FIG. 11. Dragonfly postures during oviposition and pupation (top right corner) might explain the bending posture of the elongated figure (Fig. 5A) on the far left. Images redrawn from Tillyard (1917). Photographs reproduced with permission of Warwick Tarboton (http://www.warwicktarboton.co.za/Dragonfly %20list.html). have already seen that, if these images are indeed inspired by the dragonfly, the two figures with bifid terminal apparatus on their elongated bodies may be males, whereas that in the middle without them is female. However, the bending forward posture of the figure to the left is observable across dragonfly sexual dimorphism in three behavioural aspects: mating, oviposition and pupation (Fig. 10). On pupation the larva selects a location for transformation (usually a twig near the water) where it fixes its tarsal claws firmly in position for the imago to emerge from its casing. The larva remains motionless while its internal organs swell until the skin splits open. Out of this crack will bulge the head, thorax, then legs and wings from their sheaths. The insect hangs for a while with its head down wards as its legs harden in the sun and air. Afterwards, holding firmly onto the stem, the insect withdraws its abdomen from the larval skin to climb a little way above so as to free itself fully. Transformation ends with the elongation of the abdomen and the expansion of the wings. IN THE SPELL OF THE DRAGONFLY: SYMBOLIC CORRESPONDENCES The foregoing discussion considered all the features of the depictions and identified the dragonfly as the most probable subject of these figures. In the absence of direct ethnographic information to elucidate their symbolic meaning, I now con sider the location of the site to show how its features might be significant for the symbolism of the images. The small pool in front of the shelter, which retains water for several months after the winter rains (Fig. 3), defines the symbolic lebensraum of the dragonfly. A great majority of the Odonata never travel far from their favourite haunts around their territories, which they also guard ferociously against intruders. Therefore these 'dragonfly images', and their close proximity to the pool, with which they are associated, may in part show the extent of the power of artists to envision their own ritual spaces. It is worth noting that a lack of water is fatal to most damselfly species, but some dragonflies tolerate drought. The larvae of certain species can resist prolonged droughts within arid environments such as the northern Cederberg. To survive dry spells, these larvae may shrivel up, but are quickly revived and actively burrow into the mud as soon as water becomes available. While these Odonata larvae are strictly aquatic, some peculiar larvae of Telephlebia employ a slimy integument that al lows them to live out of the water (Tillyard 1917). The biotope, "shallow, warm and open pools and ponds, even the very temporary ones" (Samways &amp; Whiteley 1997:44), is the centre of these intriguing natural relationships. I argue that these relations at the site were translated by the artists into symbolic tropes through their depictions. The understanding of these images as embodying dragonfly symbolism becomes even more plausible when we recognise that the subject matter was inspired by natural features of the site. The woman in the panel features in the biological web of these natural associations. Generally, women among most San groups are recognised not only for their important roles as child bearers, but their evocative bodily fluids such as their</page><page sequence="11">170 South African Archaeological Bulletin 68 (198): 160-172, 2013 breast milk, menstrual blood, amniotic fluid and blood are all considered to be rich with supernatural potency (Marshall Thomas 1959; Biesele 1975; Heinz 1978; Valiente-Noailles 1993). Some even believe that breast milk has such power that its smell alone can nullify the potency of a good hunter's arrow poison (Biesele 1975). Lactation evokes birth, for it is the mothers of suckling young who produce breast milk. It is likely that the act of child bearing itself is analogous to the primordial emergence from waterholes of the creator deities in San cosmology (see Biesele 1975:249-250 on the flowing of uterine fluid "through the fire and down the river" as symbolising the essence of new life). It is plausible that, just as these deities are said to have first emerged from the bowels of the earth through deep waterholes (i.e. trans-realm interfaces), women then might be a conceptual equivalent of the waterhole, with their bodies being symbolic portals whence life emerges. Among the various Kalahari San groups, the recondite link between the centre of the earth and the womb is a common metaphor (Valiente-Noailles 1993; Mguni 2006). This association around their roles to humankind involving birth, nourishment and, the earth in particular as a sepulchral destination after death gives power to the alliance between the earth and women (Savary 1990). If the woman and the nearby pool are conceptually equivalent, that gives explanatory potential for our understanding of the linking notion between the dragon fly and the antlion. They both interact with water bodies and the earth's soil respectively in similarly evocative manners. Whereas the former lays eggs in water, the latter does so in the earth's soil; both repeatedly tap the tips of their abdomens into these two mediums. In both cases this behaviour is akin to the ways in which San healers enter the spirit world. Describing their experiences, the healers speak of metaphorically diving into a waterhole and journeying underwater in their quest for the spirit world (Biesele 1975,1978,1980), which traverses both the underworld and the sky. Sometimes they journey to the sky first before descending and entering the earth's bowels (Keeney 2003). Aside from the spirit world resonances, these insects, from larva to adult, are potent carnivores. Carnivores hold a special place in San belief. Further, the San think of them as opposed to herbivores, their prey, in the same way that men and women are respectively categorised (Biesele 1986, 1993). It is possible that the San applied the same principle in the insect world. As I have shown, Odonata exhibit sexual dimorphism in certain of their features and behaviours; it must be some of these that San artists drew upon as a symbolic context for articulating the familiar male/female dichotomy (Biesele 1978). As I have suggested, the elongated figure in the middle might be female because it lacks the bifid feature while the other two, which have this feature in addition to bristling, are possibly males. However, one of these on the far left exhibits a duality that unites maleness and femaleness: its features are those of male dragonflies while its posture suggests female oviposition behaviour. In San belief this gendered duality is compatible, as seen from the manner in which men and women contribute to the potency and efficacy of the healing dance. Women sing and clap to provide the powerful dance rhythm while it is often men who dance and absorb this power to heal. Another example of this compatibility is known from women who experience revelations or gain supernatural power that they defer to their husbands who, in turn, ultimately use it to heal. For instance, when the Ju/'hoan woman Beh received the powerful giraffe song in her vision, she conveyed its power to her husband who was a healer so that its efficacy would be realised (Biesele 1993: 67-70). Although I am not aware of this figurative hint among the San, it is interesting to note that the dragonfly duality is dramatised by some indigenous observers who gave it its Nguni name of inzekamanzi (n.), which means "he who copulates with water" (isiZulu.net dictionary forum: 2007) when in reality it is the females which repeatedly strike the wa ter in the course of laying eggs. There appears to be a similar interplay in the three enigmatic paintings at hand, where some features suggest them to be male but their behaviour is partly that of females. Possible associations gleaned from some San taxonomic names might explain the conflation of dragonflies and antlions. It is worth noting that dragonflies are outwardly in direct contrast to antlions; further, antlions are weak and clumsy fliers while their dull colouration is also no match for the dragonfly brilliance. Yet they are both proficient predators. Furthermore, while antlions in their larval stages would move backwards (something the Ju/'hoansi observe as very odd [Marshall 1999]), it is the adult dragonflies that are capable of reverse mobility. Their shared name in some San languages may there fore indicate that their symbolic focus is united in some ways not dictated by the clearly divergent morphologies of these insects. Their unity might therefore be found in aspects of their behaviours, and in San beliefs and ideas. Ethnographically, there is material, though minimal, on antlions and none on dragonflies. Among the Kalahari Ju/'hoansi and G/wi, the stars and 'moving stars' (meteors) are believed to be antlions which fall down to earth at dawn to pounce on the ants, but they return to the sky at night. In so doing the antlions portend imminent death (Schapera 1930: 193-194); their bite, which is said to be very painful may, it is believed, be followed by death (Marshall 1999). By contrast, though with mouth parts that can inflict pain, dragonflies do not bite people. In /Xam belief the falling stars, which plunge and terminate in the waterholes, are hearts of the dead healers (Hollmann 2004). When these falling stars enter the water pit, they sound like the quiver, an "auditory phenomena associ ated" with healers (ibid.: 248). This revelation resonates with Old K"xau's testimony that on returning from the spirit world healers "enter the earth, and then you return to enter the skin [of your body].. .That is the sound of your return to your body" accompanied by a trembling moan (Biesele 1975:164; see also Katz 1982; Keeney 2003). So when these falling stars enter the water, they are in some ways paralleled by the dragonflies which do the same as they oviposit by tapping their abdomens into the water (sometimes accompanied by a soft plop), or for some species, by diving and submerging themselves in the water. Another key behavioural dichotomy between these two insect forms is that while dragonflies are diurnal, antlions are nocturnal. So it seems that in daylight dragonflies mirror antlions (i.e. the stars and meteors). Like the stars, dragonflies have a largely aerial existence and remarkably iridescent bodies. Also like meteor tails, they have thin and long abdo mens. They might even be construed as daylight avatars of the stars and by extension healers. A lustrously metallic coloured dragonfly, like a meteor with its 'dangerous tail', symbolically interacts with the water in a manner that is akin to breaking or mediating the interface between the ordinary and the spirit worlds as polar referents of the same cosmic sphere. These connections resonate with the dichotomy between the earth and sky, and the day and night which is commonplace in/Xam narratives (Hewitt 2008). After this exploration of the link to the stars, a further ethnographic link emerges to illuminate the single woman in the panel. In /Xam belief, when a lactating woman caught sight</page><page sequence="12">South African Archaeological Bulletin 68 (198): 160-172,2013 171 REFERENCES of falling stars (i.e. antlions) she would take away the baby from her breast, for her milk at that moment might result in the death of the child (Hollmann 2004:244-245). This death was said to be caused by the dying sorcerer who takes the potency of the fall ing star and shoots it back to the people in order to die with some of them. His "heart's strings" fall when the shooting star falls "straight down, taking its vibrations" (ibid.: 245-246). For the Ju/'hoansi, however, it is "the skin of a dead star" lying on the ground which may cause sickness to a person who steps on it (Marshall 1999: 259). Had there been ethnographic material on dragonflies, it might have illuminated the significance of their larval skins whence new insects emerge with metallic body colours in their utmost brilliance and iridescence. Could these ideas explain the double lines linked to the breasts of the woman at this site? At any rate, these double lines could be related to the notion of 'threads of light' which are themselves also allied to the stars (Lewis-Williams et al. 2000). This connec tion could explain the testimony of Naxajiame, the old blind Kua San man, that with the exception of three, "all stars are female" (Valiente-Noailles 1993: 86). Like the moon, which he said is also female and cool, "women are shining" (ibid.). And so are the dragonflies, which the San appear to equate with the antlions. TRIUMVIRATE ALLUSIONS OF INSECTIVORES These triumvirate insectiforms signify several concepts from the San system of belief and cosmology featuring the life cycle of the dragonfly and to some degree antlions as its sym bolic counterpart. The conceptual clues were readily available, from the immediate environment of the site, for the artists to use in expressing existing beliefs and worldview. Dragonflies occur around pools and streams, themselves powerful symbols of the interface between this world and the spirit world. At the same time, the shallow soil in the shelter bears ample presence of the antlions in the form of commonplace funnel-shaped holes where their larvae live. This scenario provides contrast ing habitats for these insects, as dragonflies are visible in the pool near the entrance of the shelter while antlions are evi denced by their 'spoor', the holes in the soil inside. In their complex of oral and graphic metaphors, San artists appear to have used their representational ability to delicately transpose orally expressed beliefs concerning one subject onto an artistic manifestation of another. They manipulated detailed zoological observations, ideational concepts and cosmological beliefs based on the features, behaviours and other abilities (or lack thereof) of the subject matter. Therefore, the antlion may be an indirect prevailing expression of the symbolic ideas accorded the dragonfly in this painted panel. While these two subjects may appear superficially to be in opposition, they are equally in deep unity. One mirrors the other in antithesis, but in ways which are evocative of both: dragonflies are aquatic, diurnal and swift while antlions are terrestrial, nocturnal, slow and clumsy on the wing. While both insect forms are carnivorous, dragonflies do not bite people, but antlions do. Because the three painted figures are a type of hybrid creature combining human heads and lower bodies of dragonflies or even antlions, it is possible that the artists might have envisioned these insects as symbolic embodiments of healers or even their spirits.
