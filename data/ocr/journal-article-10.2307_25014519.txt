<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Catholic Historical Review Volume XXXI APRIL, 1945 No. 1 A MEDIAEVAL PHILOSOPHY OF LAW The general neglect of mediaeval Italian legal science by modern scholarship is difficult to justify. The neglect is due to the widely-held prejudice that the development of juristic thought and legal science was not only unaided but rather impeded by the researches of the Italian doctors of law. Yet a closer examination of the various derog atory utterances would show that the main attacks ? inaugurated by Savigny1 and since then reproduced with varying degrees of inge nuity ? are directed exclusively against the method employed by the jurists, i.e., the so-called analytical-exegetical, scholastic or dialectic method, which, it is said, resulted in an empty formalism2 and frus trated the development of original thought.3 These attacks are a criti 1 Friedrich K.

Indeed, one might suspect that the existing prejudice has proved a not inconvenient ex cuse for completely ignoring the theoretical researches and achieve ments of the Italian jurists. Cultural conditions not only endowed Italian jurisprudence with an influence destined to survive for genera tions, but also made it one of the greatest legal movements in the whole history of law. The systematic study of the Italian jurists is indispensable both to the adequate evaluation of the historical development of legal ideas and to the knowledge of the idea of law itself. Jurisprudence indeed cannot afford to ignore that period of evolution of legal thought from the twelfth to the fifteenth century in the universities of Bologna, Padua, Perugia, Siena, and Naples, not to mention the great French schools at Montpellier, Orleans, and Toulouse. It is true that the office of dogmatic jurisprudence is not primarily the historical investi gation of legal conceptions, but rather the systematic arrangement of the principles of existing law.5 But historical jurisprudence, by sys tematically expounding the evolution of juristic conceptions and by investigating the formative character of those ideological agencies which moulded the principles embodied in positive law, would fur nish dogmatic jurisprudence with the historico-ideological material essential for the knowledge of the principles underlying the current legal ideas, gradually annealed by a long historical process. The thesis that law is a function of civilization, indeed its most symptomatic expression, implies not only coincidence of the growth and evolution of juristic ideas and other vital processes of common life with that of civilization in general, but also their genetic inter pretation in terms of the philosophy with which every civilization is intrinsically linked up. In particular, this thesis justifies and neces sitates the systematic study of that epoch of Western civilization in which were made the first scientific efforts to explain, with the help 4 Cf. W.

Christian moral philosophy6 with its all-pervading influence served as the inexhaustible source for the ceaseless efforts of the Ital ian professors of the Middle Ages to interpret law in universal terms. The foundations of modern philosophy of law were laid by the mediae val Italian jurists. The brilliant reputation which the scholar jurists of the North Ital ian universities enjoyed in the Middle Ages, overshadowed the more reticent research work carried out in the law school of Naples.7 There may be accidental reasons for the supremacy of the universities in the North, but their sister in the South was by no means intrinsically in ferior. For the Neapolitan legal school produced jurists who, judged by their scientific achievements, can hold equal rank with their col leagues in the North.8 The exposition of a theory about the founda tions of law by an alumnus of the Neapolitan school not only pro motes our knowledge of the development of juristic conceptions, but also sheds some light on the intellectual scope and the achievements in that university. The jurist who invites our attention is Lucas de Penna. Although fallen into oblivion, he is a shining example of sound mediaeval scholarship, an attractive figure within the circle of not less attractive personalities in the pantheon of Italian scholarship. Very few details about his life have come down to us. Diplovataccius (ob. 1511) gives no helpful information, and Panziroli's investiga tions yielded no appreciable results ? "de eius t?mulo aut die mortis 6 On Roman law and Christianity cf. F. deZulueta in The Legacy of Rome, p. 175. The everlasting achievement of the Italian doctors is that they were the first to apply Christian moral philosophy to the interpretation of legal rules. Cf. also Roscoe Pound, Interpretations of Legal History (New York, 1923), pp. 43-45. 7 It is not without significance that Savigny dealt with the school of Naples in a somewhat perfunctory way.

(Naples, 1787), is still of great value for the study of the Neapolitan school, especially for the present purpose; cf. Ill, 39 ft.</page><page sequence="4">4 WALTER ULLMANN nihil ad nos pervenit."9 In recent years two independent researches have been undertaken with a view to obtain reliable biographical ma terial, but the results have so far been very meager.10 He was born between 1320 and 1325 in Penne, a place near Pescara in the southern part of the Abbruzzi, and studied law in the university of Naples, where he received his degree of a Doctor legum in 1345. His Italian origin, place of study, and date of degree are indisputable facts, al though later authorities called him "doctor Gallicus"11 or "doctor Tholosanus"12 If any doubt should remain about his domicile in the Sicilian kingdom, it would be dispelled by his frequent references to his fatherland, such as "in civitate nostra," "in regno nostro," and the like ; by his intimate knowledge of Sicilian and Neapolitan public af fairs ; by his reminiscences of his activities as a judge and advocate in several places in Apulia, and lastly by his own reference to his origin of birth.13 It should also be mentioned that a citizen of Penne and admirer of Lucas, Mutius Pansa, wrote an inscription on his tomb in which he expressly referred to the "aemula Gallia" as enrolling Lucas amongst her sons. Professor Calasso thinks that the place name of Penne near Toulouse has given rise to the error of styling him "doc tor Tholosanus" or "Gallicus."14 But I think the possibility that he may have continued his studies at Toulouse must not be overlooked, although all direct evidence is lacking. His intimate knowledge of certain trends of French moral philosophy, for instance of the teaching of "Frater Aegidius,"15 his acquaintance with the social-ethical doc 9 G.

No in formation as to his academic activity is available; we can gather neither from his own writings nor from other sources that he was ever officially appointed an academic teacher. He himself tells us that he was a judge17 and also an advocate ;18 it was in his activity as a judge that he came into contact with Bartolus.19 He died, most prob ably, in 1390.20 Lucas's main work is a commentary on the Tres Libri Codicis (C. X.-C. XII.), a voluminous book of some 1050 folio pages.21 The preface relates how this commentary came to be written : the learned librarian of the royal library of King Robert of Naples, Paulus Peru sinus ? "ingenuus et magnae potentiae vir" as Lucas calls him ? drew the jurist's attention to the neglected study of the three books and expressed the wish himself to comment on them. When Paulus died Lucas remembered the conversation22 and set himself to work. There is no indication as to when the work was finished. Other writ ings of Lucas include a treatise called De juris Interpretationen an ordinis Eremitarium." The references to Aegidius seem to occur only with writers who actually studied in France. About Cynus cf. Gennaro M. Monti, Ci?o da Pisto ja (Citt? di Castello, 1924), and F. deZulueta in Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences, III, 465 ff. i?

His work and method reveal not only a thorough knowledge of all things legal, but, above all, complete famil iarity with contemporary and ancient philosophy and philology. Work and method display the character of a unique personality whose bril liance of thought, vastness of erudition, and power of lucid expression by far excelled those of his contemporaries. The significance of Lucas's book is inversely proportionate to its unassuming title. It is not a simple commentary on the three books of the Codex, as the title would suggest ; it contains a complete exposition of the fundamental legal principles and juristic rules relating to all departments and ram ifications of law. He proceeds by means of analytical explanation26 to a statement of the general principles behind the particular legal con cepts, thus interpreting the particular law in terms of the whole ? the legal order in itself again being an integral part of a larger whole ? the world order. It is intended to represent merely certain aspects of his comprehensive output, that is, his philosophic foundations of law, and to show the strong and all-permeating philosophic ingredient of his legal doctrines. His analyses are characterized by the exclusion of the dialectical method and by his independence of thought. He speaks of the dialec tical method, in its heyday at his time, in somewhat sarcastic terms : 24 In the Biblioteca Angelica di Roma, cf. Calasso, op. cit., p. 403. 25 Giustiniani, op. cit., p. 42. Cf., in particular, Lucas's long glosses to King Robert's constitutions in Constitutiones Regni Utriusque Siciliae (Lyons, 1568), fols. 323 ff., 342 ff., 360 ff., etc. On the tract of Lucas de Penna, In Valerium Maximum quem librum dedicat Gregorio P. P., which tract is alleged to be in the library of Leiden, cf. Girard, op. cit., p. 42. This pope is certain to be Gregory IX who died 1378. 26 Philology played an important role in his commentaries. The dictionary of Papias, a mediaeval grammarian, who wrote about 1063 (cf. J. E. Sandys, His tory of Classical Scholarship, I, 3rd ed. [Cambridge, 19273, 521) was his chief guide in philological questions. For numerous examples of philological-gram matical interpretations cf. Calasso, op. cit., pp. 438-43.</page><page sequence="7">A MEDIAEVAL PHILOSOPHY OF LAW 7 "Dialectorum namque tendicula sunt quaedam phantasmata et umbrae, quae cito resolvuntur .... et qui dial?ctica arte diebus noctibusque tor quentur, in obscuritate mentis gradiuntur."27 Recognizing that words are merely vehicles of expression, he strongly disapproves of those scholars who dally superficially with words instead of attempting to draw out the meaning behind them : "Neque in verbis est veritas scrip turarum, sed in sensu, non in superficie, sed in medulla, non in ver borum f oliis, sed in ratione rationis ; et sicut anima praefertur corpori, ita sensus verbis . . . plerumque enim dum proprietas verborum at tenditur, sensus veritatis amittitur."28 His power and originality of thought permit him to examine legal problems independently: he neither yields to the authority of the gloss,29 nor does he bow before the titanic figure of Bartolus,30 and the growing prestige of Cynus or Baldus31 do not affect his own scientific conclusions. Although he knows their teachings thoroughly and is well acquainted with the can onist doctrines, in particular with those of the "Archidiaconus"32 and Innocent IV, he bases the acceptance or rejection of the doctrine of 27 C. xi, 19, 1 no. 7. This passage is preceded by the statement that logic itself is not science, but only a method of scientific inquiry: "Scientia quidem logicalis non est scientia, sed quidem modus sciendi." The writer offers his apologies for the amount of Latin quotations to be found in this article. But he thinks that, apart from the difficulties of checking refer ences in sixteenth-century books, neither a translation nor a mere summary of the thoughts expressed in the passages could render the exposition of his doc trines faithfully or vividly. The literal quotations, moreover, seem to contribute effectively to a better insight into his ways of thinking, unusual as they were. 28 C. xi, 23, 1 no. 5. 29 Cf. e.g., C. x, 44, 1 no. 3 : "Sed certe quicquid in hoc glossa dicat," or C. xi, 59, 7 no. 16: "Licet glossa contrarium teneat." Cf. also C. xii, 1, 2 no. 4 where he gives his general views on the gloss. 30 Cf. e.g., C. xii, 1, 2 no. 16: "Hoc tenuit pro veritate dominus Bartolus de Saxoferrato et quidam alii sequentes eum. Ego reputo hanc maximam fal sitatem." 31 C. xi, 19, 1 no. 18. 32 That is, the famous canonist Guido de Baysio {ob. 1313). The "legists" as a rule did not take much notice of what the "canonists" said. Cf. Lucas's attacks against the legists who neglect the canonists, in particular against Jacobus Butrigarius, C. xii, 1, 17, no. 36. Nor did the canonists take account of the legists. Cf. the late H. Kantorowicz, Studies in the Glossators of the Roman Law, in collaboration with W. W. Buckland (Cambridge, 1938), p. 91, and the present writer's remarks in Revue d'Histoire du Droit, XVII (1939), 31.</page><page sequence="8">8 WALTER ULLMANN other authorities on purely rational grounds ? authority and prestige carry little weight with him: "Plerumque plus premit quam docet auctoritas," says Lucas. He expresses the hope that in scientific re searches "non doctorum opinio, sed doctrinae ratio attendetur." Pur suit of truth is to Lucas the sole criterion of scholarship and, as we shall presently see, the guiding principle in legal science. The aim of legal science, he states in the unusually long preface to his main work,33 is the discovery of the principles through which law attains binding force and validity. The researches of the glossators of the Roman law and their contemporary successors did not yield sat isfactory results, chiefly because they tried, as Lucas critically remarks, to solve the problem of the authority of law with purely legal argu ments ; they had attempted to find first principles within the law. He abandons the traditional landmarks of contemporary jurisprudence and widens its scope by recourse to philosophy ? "rerum divinarum et humanarum cognito, cum studio bene vivendi juncta."34 It is an axiom of his that to comprehend law the jurist must lay bare those fundamental principles, which lie behind the legal concepts and juri dical precepts, from which law derives its authority and through which law attains its binding force. The jurist should investigate the binding character of laws rather than their wording : "Ego autem, inquantum potui huiusmodi iiiusitata, quin et alia exponere et explanare curavi, eo quod scire leges non est earum verba tenere, sed vim ac potestatem, ff. de legibus, lex 'scire' " (no. 6). In his opinion, legal rules could not claim final authority within their own somewhat restricted sphere, since they are subordinated to ethical rules. The most vital part of philosophy, therefore, was in his view, ethics.34a Unshakable faith in the eternal truth of Christianity35 made him adopt Christian moral 33 This preface of nearly six folio columns deals with the shortcomings and aberrations of contemporary legal science. It is a masterpiece of language, style, and arguments. But space does not permit any lengthy quotations. We must refer the reader to the preface itself. The few quotations will, it is hoped, suffice to show Lucas's genuine zeal to discover the truth. 34 C. x, 53, 8 no. 2. 34*On these 'ethical tendencies' of legal science in the Middle Ages, cf. Pound, Interpretations of Legal History, pp. 41-47. 35 Cf. : "Omnipotens desiderium meum audiat . . . in eo plenitudinem fiduciae ponens, qui ex quinqu? piscibus et septum panibus multitudinem satiavit esurien tium," preface no. 1. Similar utterances in many other places.</page><page sequence="9">A MEDIAEVAL PHILOSOPHY OF LAW 9 philosophy as his spiritual guide ; it furnished him with the specula tive basis for systematic thought about the ultimate foundations of law. On the assumption that law is merely the legal enactment of extra-legal principles, he charges legal concepts with normative con tent. Legal rules originating from, and fundamentally agreeing with, ethical rules are normative in character. The employment of ideo logical principles is therefore an inescapable consequence. These axio matic considerations lead him to the further conclusion that scholar ship should be pervaded with the spirit of the Christian faith, because it is precisely this spiritual element which safeguards the search for truth. For all science, Lucas avows, serves one purpose only and as pires to one single aim ? if it wants to be called genuine science, namely, to know God in His eternal Wisdom, because God "cuneta praevidet et cuneta dijudicat." He is the beginning and the end, the cause of all being : "Deus est alpha et omega, principium et finis, cui saecula nee accesserunt nee coaeterna sunk"36 True happiness in the world at large, he declares, can only come through the acceptance of the ideas contained in Christian revelation. "Vera autem beatitudo," he says convincingly, "est revelatio gloriae magni Dei et salvatoris nostri Jesu Christi.,, Yet it was not only Christian moral philosophy proper which should be applied to legal investigations : the results attained by the philoso phers of antiquity are to be resorted to provided they are not incom patible with Christian beliefs: "Si philosophi antiqui aliqua forte vera fidei nostrae dixerunt accomoda, non solum rejicienda non sunt, sed ab eis tamquam ab injustis possessoribus in usum nostrum vindi canda sunt."37 Furthermore, the writings of historians and poets have to be consulted; they should testify and illustrate the good and bad character of human actions. As law is viewed by him as a consistent, harmonious whole, the jurist with sufficient interest in his subject should take into consideration canon law and the doctrines of "canonum professores illustres ;" their achievements will be presented in his work as "prius legistis incognita.

Fugiendum quippe, quod malum est, quod vero est, undique melius inquirendum et inveniendum est." It would be a fascinating study to trace the influences of various philosophical systems and to show which of them was most deter minative in its influence within our particular subject, but limitations of space make this investigation impossible. We have, therefore, to confine ourselves to a mere enumeration of the principal authorities by which his doctrines were decisively affected. Resuscitated Greek philosophy supplies Lucas with the basic philo sophical equipment. He draws extensively on the writings of Plato42 and, above all, on those of Aristotle, whom he calls in true mediaeval fashion "princeps philosophiae."43 He does not omit Plutarch.44 Of the Roman thinkers, Cicero is preferred to all others?"Tullius, sec undus philosophus," "excellentissimus philosophus et juriscon sulte;45 whilst the Stoic doctrines of Seneca,46 Andronicus' peri 38 Cf. e.g., C. x, 11, 2 no. 1 ; xi, 18, 1 no. 26 (Eruditionis didascaliae) and C. x, 31, 42 no. 1 ; x, 47, 8 no. 4 (De arrha anintae). 39 He alludes to the Vocabularium of Papias which he extensively uses, cf. supra, note 26. 4&lt;&gt; Ibid., no. 9. 4i Ibid., no. 7. 42 Cf. e.g., C. x, 5, 2 no. 4 ; xi, 19, 1 no. 8 ; xi, 53, no. 7.

Cassiodorus,50 and Boethius.51 Strong in fluence in topics relating to moral philosophical problems was exer cised by St. Augustine52 ? "sol sapientiae in ecclesia Dei."53 The exact quotations of passages by Lucas indicate that he was thoroughly familiar with the saint's writings. Another source of Augustinian thought is the doctrines of "Frater Aegidius," that is, Aegidius Co lonna, particularly his treatise De regimine principum?* which he frequently uses as his authority in questions concerning public law, government, and the monarch. Judged by the frequency of references and by the arguments employed, the strongest influence exercised by any single authority on Lucas was John of Salisbury's Polict-aticus?* There is hardly a page in Lucas's voluminous book which does not con 47 FI. 58 B.C. as head of the peripatetic school in Rome.

Lucas thought of the Poli</page><page sequence="12">12 WALTER ULLMANN tain at least one reference to the Policratkus; it is especially in prob lems of a social-ethical nature that this treatise is his exclusive source of information and his trusted adviser. Besides the thinkers and writers mentioned, references to SS. Jerome,56 Bernard,57 and Gregory58 as well as to Alanus de Insulis58a are not infrequent. It should also be noted that Lucas was acquainted with St. Anselm of Canterbury59 and with a pupil of John of Salisbury, Pierre du Blois,60 who after his appointment to the royal curia of Sicily may have taken a copy of the Policratkus with him and may thus have been the medium through which that English philosophical treatise reached the southern seats of learning. The consultation of St. Thomas Aquinas's writings will cause little surprise, in view of Lucas's spiritual environment, the Nea craticus as the name of the author, and not as that of a book. This personification occurs throughout Lucas's commentaries. * It is indeed surprising that this overwhelming influence of John of Salisbury on Italian jurists has completely escaped the attention of historians and legal historians. The literature on John of Salisbury, as far as the writer consulted it, does not contain any record of this important fact. Cf. H. Reuter, Johannes von Salisbury (Berlin, 1842) ; C. Schaarschmidt, Johannes Sarisberiensis (Leipzig, 1862) ; R. L. Poole, Medieval Thought and Learning (London, 2nd ed. 1920), pp. 201-25; C. C. J. Webb, John of Salisbury (London, 1932). Miss Waddell, on the other hand, seems to have been surprised when her attention was drawn to the one reference to the Policratkus by Dante's commentator, Ben venuto da Imola; cf. Essays and Studies of the English Association, XIII (Ox ford, 1928), 30. Cf. now the writer's study on "The Influence of John of Salisbury," English Historical Review, LIX (1944), 384 ff. Philosophic thought was not the only English influence on dogmatic juris prudence in Italy. Actual legal customs "Angliae" were frequently referred to in lectures and commentaries of the Doctors; cf. Hazeltine's preface to C. B.

Lucas always refers to St. Thomas with great reverence and usually calls him the 'sanctus doctor.'60* Finally, mention must be made of the wealth of material that Lucas uses for illustrative purposes. In the first place the historians: Herodotus,61 Livy,62 Sallust,63 Hegesippus, Flavius Josephus,64 Sue tonius ;65 secondly, the poets : Vergil,66 Horace,67 Terence,68 and Pe trarch.69. He is even acquainted with the Trismegistus, a collection of ancient Greek and Latin writings of a religious and philosophic nature, ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus.70 The question may legitimately be asked whether Lucas de Penna wras actually acquainted with the vast amount of ancient and mediaeval works which he refers to, or whether he merely used quotations which he found in other authors. There is, of course, no evidence for a definite answer to either question, but his quotations and references give good reason to assume a positive answer to the first alternative : the exactness of his quotations, always to title, book, chapter of the work referred to, and the correct quotation of whole passages, do not suggest that he merely used other authors and copied their quotations. Furthermore, his method of references and quotations is quite unlike that of the traditional mediaeval modes of quoting, at least amongst the jurists, usually without exact references. His familiarity with con temporary scholarship is disclosed by references to relatively unknown 60a C. x, 69, 2 no. 5; xi, 41, 1 no. 21, etc. "Sanctus Thomas" in C. xi, 47, 1 no. 5. 61 Cf. e.g., C. xii, 43, 2 no. 12. 62 Cf.

Scott, Herm?tica (Oxford, 4 vols., 1924-36), I, 11.</page><page sequence="14">14 WALTER ULLMANN authors, such as to Gerardus de Senis, an Augustinian monk of the middle of the fourteenth century.70a Lastly, he himself attaches great value to the study of the philosophical writings in their original and warns the student against the dangers and errors hidden in current translations and transcriptions. His quotations seem even to imply an acquaintance with Greek, although no direct evidence is available that he did know Greek. Lucas bases the ultimate authority of law on the virtue of justice, which, conceived as transcendental in its origin, is immutable in its nature. Law is "justitiae sanctio" or "norma justitiae." His theory of law is an attempt at an interpretation, in universal terms, of the law of his time. In full agreement with all mediaeval legal philosophers71 he considers law as a system for ordering human conduct and for ad justing human relations with a view to the destined end of man. "Cum scientia totius utriusque juris quamvis particulariter vertatur circa justitiae notitiam, eo quod jus est objectum justitiae, secundum Aris totelem, quinto Ethicorum, et a justitia appellatum est jus .... et jus justitiae executivum, non est incongruum hic de tarn excellent i et salub?rrima virtute quaedam memorari."72 He points out that the ordinary contemporary jurist was too little interested in eliciting the import and implications of this virtue. Somewhat sarcastically he remarks, "quamquam de extra legis materia ad simplicium juristarum eruditionem hie scribere mihi placuit."73 Virtue, abstractly con sidered, is a mental quality which is infused into man as a moral crea ture, guiding him in the appropriate direction. "Virtus est bona qualitas mentis," Lucas says, betraying the influence of St. Thomas, "qua recte vivitur, qua nemo male utitur, qua Deus in nobis sine nobis operatur." Setting out from this ethical tenet he proceeds to amplify and to interpret the concept of justice. His investigations begin with a brief outline of the historical development of the idea of justice, which, in his opinion, is "regina virtutum," embracing, so to speak, all other 70a C. xi, 32, 2 no. 1. He refers to the monk's treatise De Usuris. 71 Cf. the present writer's article, "Baldus's Conception of Law'' in Law Quarterly Review, LVIII (1942), 386 ff. 72 C. x, 72, 4 pr. 73 C. xi, 22, 1, 5.</page><page sequence="15">A MEDIAEVAL PHILOSOPHY OF LAW 15 virtues,74 and without which not even illegal or anti-social communi ties can live.75 The contributions of Aristotle, Cicero, and St. Au tine to the knowledge of the idea of justice seem to him of intrinsic value and particular interest, since he quotes their descriptions of jus tice in full.76. But their views apparently leave him unsatisfied, though he does not expressly disapprove of them. After this outline he de clares that "our justice," that is, justice as defined in Justinian's law books, is recommended by St. Thomas Aquinas ? "apud nos autem diffinitur justitia, ff. de justitia et jure, lege 'justitia', quam defi nitionem commendat Thomas de Aquino, secunda secundae, qu. 58, art. I." Justice as modified by St. Thomas, meets with Lucas's ap proval, though again an explicit acceptance is missing. "Reducit (seil. Thomas) autem ad perfectam definitionem justitiae, hoc modo, justitia est habitus, secundum quern aliquis constante et perpetua vol?ntate jus sum unicuique tribuit."77 Although he affirms his agree ment with the content of justice as perceived by Justinian (Cicero) and St. Thomas, he implies that the immutable and transcendental char acter of justice is not sufficiently stressed by them, for he avows that Trismegistus described this metaphysical idea best by declaring that "justitia (sicut verissime Trismegistus d?finit) nihil aliud est quam Dei motus."78 He recalls with approval the eulogy of Lactantius that "nemo pauper est, nisi justitia indiget, nemo dives, nisi qui virtutibus plenus est." Justice is, in other words, a "divinus fructus." In his commentary on C. XII, 45, 1 no. 28, he states that "Dei spiritus est 74 C. x, 72, 4 no. 5: "In justitia quidem simul omnis virtus est," and no. 3: "Omnes virtutes simul amplectantur." 75 C. x. 72, 4 no. 5: "Tanta enim est vis justitiae, ut nee illi, qui maleficio et scelere pascuntur, sine ulla eius part?cula vivere possint, nam et princeps latro num, nisi aequaliter praedam dispartiat, aut interficietur aut relinquetur." The Ciceronian trend of thought is unmistakable. 76Ibid., no. 1. Aristotle: "Est justitia habitus secundum quern aliquis dicitur esse operativus secundum electionem justi. . . "; Cicero: "Tullius autem secundo rhetoricae dicit, quod justitia est animi habitus communi utilitate servata, suam cuique tribuens dignitatem." St. Augustine: "Justitia est rectitudo voluntatis per se servata; haec est omnium perfectissima virtus, quae jura nobis omnibus distribuit." 77Ibid., no. 2. He continues: "Et quasi eandem definitionem esse dicit cum praedicta d?finitione Aristotelis." 78 Ibid., no. 4.</page><page sequence="16">16 WALTER ULLMANN justitiae lumen." Thus the raison d'?tre of the authority of justice lies in its emanation from the divine will. In support of this meta physical conception of justice and of the transcendental basis of law he alludes to Cicero's famous dictum : "Nihil praestabilius quam plene intelligere nos ad justitiam natos esse ?eque opinione, sed natura esse constitutum jus." Moreover, to deprive law of its metaphysical basis and to assume that law is grounded in sentiments or ideas of the people, would be equal to anarchy, and to think that all institutions bearing the name legal are just, and emanate from justice, would be mere foolishness. Strong words are used by Lucas: "Illud vero stultissimum est existimare omnia justa esse, quae sita sunt in pop ulorum institutis, aut legibus etiam. Quod si populorum jussis, si principum de?retis, si sententiis judicum, jura constituerentur, jus esset adulterare, jus latrocinari, jus falsa testamenta supponere, si ex suffragio aut scitis multitudinis probarentur." In pursuance of this axiomatic idea he professes that God is justice itself and that this virtue, in common with all other theological and cardinal virtues, is implanted in man as a moral creature. He holds, following St. John Chrysostom, that "qui omnem justitiam facit .... Deum videt, quoniam justitia figura Dei est."79 Lucas claims that the cultivation of justice is "summum bonum." To make justice the basis of one's life, means to live in accordance with the divine will. "In semita justitiae vita," Lucas ?declares, "iter autem devium ducit ad mortem. Justum deducit dominus per vias rectas."80 The injunctions which justice contains, are in his view a combination of religious-ethical maxims and of Roman juridical principles. "Praecepta justitiae vero sunt decem praecepta decalogui, alieni restitutio, ac honeste vivere, alterum non laedere, jus suum unicuique tribuere."81 But all the de tailed characteristics of justice may be comprehended in the one im perative which is, or should be, the foundation of all social life and its Ibid., no. 5. 80 Ibid., no. 8.

The ruler of the State, in the opinion of the Neapolitan Doctor, was entrusted with the protection of, and care for, his subjects ; his duty was to enhance the common good by making justice the supreme cri terion in the" exercise of his authority over his people: "Principes terrarum a Deo sunt instituti, ut communem populi utilitatem pro curent."83 The significance of this idea and the duty incumbent on the ruler of the state warrant some elucidation. Justice is the foun dation of peace within states and the guiding principle in all questions relating to public government, for "sine justitia vero impossibile est civitatibus pacem dare; opus justitiae pax."84 The abandonment or the neglect of the idea of justice in the realm of public government would change civilized communities into mere bands of robbers.85 Internal strife and injustices committed by governments on their sub jects are agencies destructive to the peaceful continuance of the State.86 It is the uncontrollable emotions of ruler and government, such as envy, hatred, and the consequent favoritism, which prove harmful to the peace of the commonwealth. He declares: "Nota, quod circa regimina publica omnis passio d?bet abscedere."87 Most destructive of all is bribery, "acceptio personarum" ? not infrequent in his time88 ? since the prospects of material wealth give free play to the passions 82 Ibid. Cf. also C. x, 72, 4 no. 9 : "Quod tibi fieri non vis, aliis non feceris, et econtra, quod tibi vis fieri, aliis feceris." 83 C. x, 18, 1 no. 9. 84 C. x, 72, 4 no. 4. Cf. also no. 9 : "Nihil tarn inimicum civitatibus est quam in justitia." 85 "Sublata namque justitia et r?gna, res publicae urbium singularum nihil aliud sunt quam latrocinia," C. xi, 22, 1 no. 1, with a reference to the Civitas Dei, lib. iv, cap. 4. Lucas seems to have labored under the same misapprehension as modern authorities with regard to this famous dictum of St. Augustine. On wrong interpretations of St. Augustine, cf. Christopher Dawson, "St. Augustine and His Age" in A Monument to St. Augustine (London, 1930), pp. 63 ff. 86 "Contradictio autem et iniquitates delent civitates," ibid. 87 Ibid. 88 C. x, 72, 4 no. 7 : "Hodie maxime ..."</page><page sequence="18">18 WALTER ULLMANN which easily result in physical violence : "Cum autem lucrum aut pre tium intervenit, tune passio non stat solum in animo, sed pervenit ad actum, id est, ad manum."89 He observes that kingdoms change hands as a consequence of trickeries and frauds.90 The idea of a just government entails that the common good should be set above the private good : "Utilitas publica privatae praeferenda est ; quando con currit privata cum publica, nulli dubium est, quod privata succumbit."91 In short, justice exercised by the ruler is of higher moral value and more beneficial to his subjects than the temporal gain of material wealth: "Justitia regnantis utilior est subjectis quam fertilitas tem poris."92 The office of the judge is, Lucas assures us, the decision of concrete cases on the basis of "vera justitia."93 Judgment proper is that judicial decision the content of which is derived from the idea of justice.94 Judgments fulfill their proper function through the pronouncement of justice embodied in the decision applicable to the particular case.95 The judge should be dispassionate; observations on the mischievous judicial activity of some judges "in regno nostro" justify, he thinks, some warnings. It constitutes, in his opinion, illegality when the judge, in spite of the clear wording of the positive law and with dis regard of the fixed legal rule applicable to the actual case, bases his decision on arguments which are only superficially legal, and on "ex quisitae rationes," but which in truth are to hide his intention to give favorable judgment on account of the particular circumstances or per sons of the case.96 Receiving of bribes by the judge entails loss of his 89 C. xi, 22, 1 no. 1. 90 C. x, 72, 4 no. 9: "Propter injurias et injustitias, contumelias et diversos dolos regnum transfertur de gente in gentem." 91 C. x, 32, 31 no. 2, cf. C. xi, 42, 1 no. 11. 92 C. x, 72, 4 no. 4. 93 Ibid., no. 6. The judge should not perform his duties with dislike, but with ardent affection : "Non odio, sed bono zelo." Cf. C. xi, 26, 1 no. 8 : He is bound to say that men judge more "odio aut amore aut cupiditate aut iracundia aut dolor e aut laetitia aut spe aut timor? aut iracundia aut dolore aut err ore aut aliqua promotione mentis ? quam veritate." 94 C. x, 72, 4 no. 5. 95 C. x, 72, 4 no. 6. 96 "Decidere quippe quaestiones non per casum legis expressum, sed per argumenta legalia et exquisitas rationes contra manifestam aequitatem vel quia ex personarum et rerum qualitatibus ratio contrarium suaderet, non multum</page><page sequence="19">A MEDIAEVAL PHILOSOPHY OF LAW 19 moral integrity and of the confidence placed in him and should result in his dismissal from office ; he recommends in like cases that the dis missed judge should first give satisfaction to those who suffered by his corrupt jurisdiction, before he is brought to trial.97 The abstract idea of justice is divided by Lucas into two main species, i.e., into a general and a particular justice. In the former sense justice deals with human actions in so far as they are directed towards the common good and this justice may also be called legal justice. It is this kind of justice which moves man to give society its due. Particular justice, on the other hand, comprises human actions which concern the relations between man and man.98 The correspond ing Aristotelian connotations of distributive and commutative justice are employed to show that crimes are merely violations of justice in either sense ; the right to punish is based not on the need for protection, but rather on the supposed violation of justice.99 This is a material rather than a formal conception of crime. But Lucas professes that safeguards are necessary against a rigidly static and inflexible conception of justice. He emphasizes that the concrete realization of the idea of justice may lead to most unsatis factory results which reveal a vast gulf between the ethical ideal of justice and its realized form. A distortion of the idea is brought about by a sophisticated and "over-skillful" interpretation which as a result divorces the notion of justice from its inherent meaning and sense. In his opinion only a certain emotional attitude enables the in terpreter to counteract those disagreeable excesses of interpretation. The intelligent and efficient interpretation of law presupposes the oper ation of a corrective or regulative element. This element, he declares, is charity, which, at the same time, is a constructive and creative ele ment of the idea of law. "Vera justitia ex opere non consummatur, nisi etiam voluntas affuerit," he is wont to stress, "et semper justitia reputo sapientis, quod enim illegale, i.e. non secundum legem scriptam aut non secundum rationem continet omnem injustitiam et commune est omnis injustitiae," C. x, 76 Rubrica no. 11. 97 C. xii, 1, 12 no. 10. 98 C. x, 72, 4 no. 3 : "Generalis dicitur . . . quia ordinat hominem ad bonum commune, haec eadem dicitur legalis justitia . . . particularis est, quae ordinat hominem circa ea, quae sunt ad alterum vel ad singularem personam." 99 C. x, 11, 5 nos. 29-34.</page><page sequence="20">20 WALTER ULLMANN est cum misericordia, i.e., dementia, temperanda."100 He utters a warning against those administrators of law who are wrapped up in a petrified conception of justice, thereby overlooking the real issue of justice and fulfilling, by their decisions, that well known legal paradox summum jus summa injuria. "Existunt saepe," he says on this point, "injuriae calumnia quadam et nimis callida, sed malitiosa juris inter pretatione, ex quo illud 'summum jus summa injuria' factum est, jam tritum sermone proverbium."101 Charity is to be imposed on justice and is to function as a moderating and alleviating agency to prevent excesses of "statutory legality."102 Steering a middle course is the device which he gives : "Superabundantia et defectus omnia corrum punt, medium autem salvat, charitas aedificat."103 It is in this setting that Lucas attempts to clarify the concept of equity. After quoting Aristotle104 and stating that equity is an attri bute, an epiphenomenon, of justice, he proceeds in his commentary on C. XII, 19, 12 to draw out the meaning of equity. There he af firms that the ethical idea of justice undergoes a transformation into a positive, real agency which creates law and which is its proximate cause. This transformation is achieved by charity bearing upon jus tice : "Aequitas est justitia dulcore misericordiae temperata."105 In its concrete meaning equity is nothing else but the idea of justice applied to the particular case. Following John of Salisbury he says: "Est autem aequitas secundum Policraticum lib. 4, c. 2, rerum convenientia, quae cuneta aequiparat ratione et in paribus rebus paria jura desiderat, in omnes aequalis, unicuique tribuens, quod est suum."106 He holds that the principle of equity is not only a safeguard against a mechanical, literal interpretation of law with its results contrary to the funda mental idea of justice, but also the safest guide in the sphere of actual application. Moreover, equity in the defined sense is the proximate source of law : "Lex est super aequitate fundanda .... lex d?bet super 100 C. x, 72, 4 no. 6. *oi ibid. 102 Cf. also C. xii, 42, 1 no. 15 : "Justitiam d?bet temperare moderatio, quod verbum habet operari diminutionem, non augmentum." 103 Ibid. : "Nimia justitia superbiam et horrorem parit . . . interdum albuginem in oculo parit sicut nimia sapientia." Cf. also C. x, 72, 4 no. 6 : "Nimium Justus p?rit justitia sua." 104 c. xi, 22, 1 no. 6. 105 C. xii, 19, 12 no. 31, referring to the "Archidiaconus." * Ibid.</page><page sequence="21">A MEDIAEVAL PHILOSOPHY OF LAW 21 aequitate fundari."107 Law which is not equitable is an untenable idea : "Jus nisi aequm, jus non est ; nee est opus sanae mentis."108 In other words, law is merely the external form of equity : "lex est forma aequitatis," and therefore its interpreter : "Lex eius interpres est."109 Law rationalizes the idea of benevolence inherent in the idea of equity110 which becomes a directing force for the legislator in creating law : "Est virtus dirigens ad positionem bonarum legum."111 Rec ognizing that cases frequently occur which are not covered by positive law nor dealt with by any legal rule, Lucas assigns a further function to equity. The judge has to apply the principle of equity to the de cision of cases about which the positive law is silent (casus omissi).112 The origin of equity is to be found in natural reason : "Aequitas ex naturali ratione procedit."113 This views presents the idea that man is a rational and moral creature. He affirms that nature brings about social co-existence through the potency of reason ("natura vi rationis hominem concili?t homini et ad vitae societatem") and that reason forbids the unequal treatment of individuals.114 Actions contrary to natural reason are, therefore, to be considered as "iniquae." Conse quently, it causes no surprise when we find that Lucas arrives at the idea, however vaguely conceived, of a natural equality of men : equity in the sense of equality is not only the source of law ("lex super aequitate est fundanda, quia aequalitas est affectus unitatis"),115 but it is also the aim of law.116 Equality before the law is the foundation of legal procedure and the basis of the impartiality of the judge.117 i?7 C. x, 5, 2 nos. 7 and 2. i?8 C. xii, 19, 12 no. 31.

The emotional attitude of charity is called forth into action by natural reason as the source of direct, universal understanding of human situations. Equity is thought of by Lucas not as a meta physical concept, but as a human agency regulated by emotion and reason. Equity, according to him, is modified justice, is human justice. After this brief outline of Lucas's thoughts on the origin and func tion of justice, we may turn to an examination of his views on law itself, and in particular on positive law. Lucas maintains that the authority of law is the most powerful fac tor in man's social life, since its regulates human life by its ordinances, based on the principles of equity. Law is "lux et via vitae," and "nihil tarn studiosum in rebus humanis inveniri potest quam legum auctori tas, quae divinas et humanas res bene disponit, et omnem iniquitatem expellit."118 But, he assures us, the law could not fulfill this function if it merely emanated from the will of the people. The creation of law cannot be placed in the hands of the people which has not been given law-creative authority. Furthermore, the "will of the people," he argues, is subject to numerous influences which would render it ex tremely difficult to uphold the thesis that law is based on the meta physical conception of justice. The controversy as to the law-giving authority, whether the people or the head of the state ? very much in the foreground of discussion at his time119 ? is decided by Lucas in favor of the latter alternative. It is the ruler alone who has the power to create new law and to abolish existing law. The people have no right whatsoever to take part in legislation.

Multi tudo namque libenter consentit in vitio .... et ob tumultum cito a vero deviat pergitque in indirectum.

Multitudinis vero imperitae con silium et quae (quod?) populare consilium sequitur, nee fructus boni nee jucunditatem nee memoriam habet120 .... nihil tarn facile quam vilem plebiculam et indoctam conditione et linguae volubilitate de cipere; quae quicquid non intelligit, plus miratur, populum namque decipiunt, qui beatificunt eum et viam gressum morum dissipant. Mihi nihil umquam populare placuit, eamque optimam rem publi cam esse dico, quae sit in potestate optimorum, nam quanto major est populus, tanto ab intellectu est remotior; nihil est facilius quam in quemlibet affectum commovere populum. He feels the necessity of adding that customary law obtains its effi cacy and binding force by confirmation of the ruler: "Praemissa tarnen non urgent in casu nostrae quaestionis, nam consuetudo ipsa et aliae sunt regis privilegio confirmatae." The ruler is the only law-creating authority. This is a natural corollary of his view of the function of the head of the state in general. We have already pointed out that the ruler is entrusted with the care of his subjects. The creation of law is, therefore, one of his main functions and his exclusive privilege and duty : "Sola quidem voluntas princpis est lex."121 The sovereign derives his authority to create and to sanction law from God: "Imperator a Deo condendae legis po testatem accepit . . . . 122 Deus Imperatori sanciendi leges potestatem dedit. Jus civile divinitus est per ora principum promulgatum."123 The ruler is merely the medium through which God creates law that is known as human or civil law. It attains binding force, because it emanates from him by virtue of his divine mandate: "Et sic potest dici divina sanctio omnis lex" is Lucas's conclusion. The obligatory character of law rests on the divine will as the ultimate source of all 120 C. x, 36, 1 nos. 25-6 with a reference to St. Jerome's letter Ad Nepotianum. 121 C. x, 26, 3 no. 1, and in many other places. i22 C. xi, 19, 1 no. 3. i23 C. x, IS, 1 no. 8.</page><page sequence="24">24 WALTER ULLMANN law. The ruler alone is endowed with the "divinum lumen" (C. xi, 18, 1 no. 3) which imparts binding force to his laws alone. Thus, the constitutive element of the obligatory character of law is, not the ruler's will per se, but God's Will, for "non est homo, qui ligat, sed Deus, qui dignos facit homines tanti honoris" (C. xi, 70, 5 no. 42). Law is a hallowed ordinance: "Sandio sancta jubens honesta, prohib ens contraria." This is a most thorough-going application of Lucas's theistic world-outlook. The ruler receives his mandate from God directly.124 He is "divinitatis imago" ? God's representative on earth for the gov ernance of temporal affairs.125 This view, we may add, is diamet rically opposed to the contemporary views current in the universities of the North126 but is in line with the conceptions prevailing in the South. Bartholomaeus de Capua, another jurist of the fourteenth century, had ideas similar to those of Lucas, when he taught that the ruler is God's vice-gerent on earth in temporal matters.127 These identical views of Lucas and Bartholomaeus found strong support in the actual political conditions in the Neapolitan kingdom, characterized by a firmly centralized government.128 This actuality of the political structure may present itself as a reason for Lucas's almost excessive devotion to the ruler and, furthermore, for his detestation of anything that might be called ?the expression of the "people's will." In many i24 Sixteenth-century political thought had undoubtedly cast its shadows as far back as the middle of the fourteenth century. i25 The statement by A. J. Allen, History of Political Thought in the Six teenth Century (London, 1928), p. 282, that this conception of the ruler as the image of God was first elaborated in the fifteenth century, is quite mislead ing. Lucas is perfectly familiar with "the conception of a prince ruling abso lutely as the representative of God," Allen, op. cit., p. 281. Moreover, this idea is plainly expressed in the Policraticus to which Lucas refers : iv, 1 ; vi, 25 ; viii, 17. i26 Cf. especially Woolf, op. cit., pp. 72 ff. On St. Thomas's views cf. A.

The peaceful atmosphere and tranquility in Naples com pare, Lucas points out in a number of places, very favorably with the northern conditions and, in his opinion, are due to the salutary govern ment by a prince.129 In his further disquisitions Lucas adopts an anthropomorphic view of the state in which its organs are compared with those of a living organism. The ruler takes the place of the head of the body politic, the eyes, ears, and tongue are likened to the judges and governors of the provinces, the arms to other executive officials, and the feet of the body politic are represented by the peasants. It should be men tioned that this anthropomorphic view is already contained in the Policratkus and was wholly taken over by Lucas.130 On the other hand, Lucas is firmly convinced that the tyrant is the "image of depravity," who cruelly oppresses his people by his des potism. The basis of his government is brute force, whilst that of the ruler is justice and law. The tyrant, Lucas is wont to stress, misuses the powers bestowed upon him by God and perverts the idea of a divine governance of the world. It cannot cause any surprise that he strongly counsels the subjects of a tyrant to resort to the only measure adequate to deal with "this most evil creature on earth,"131 i.e., to kill the tyrant. "For the Heavenly Father will only be comforted by the destruction of this public enemy" ("publiais hostis"). This thesis is directly derived from the Policratkus in which tyrannicide is advocated. Quoting the very words of John of Salisbury, Lucas says that it is not only permissible, but right and just to kill this "pestilence i29 In many places he treats of the best forms of government and reiterates his abhorrence of the people's will and strongly asserts that the best form of govern ment is monarchy. His contemptuous attitude towards the people may also have been influenced by the Policraticus, vii, 9. 130 On John of Salisbury's organic views cf. Charles H.

Lucas postulates three essential conditions for any law. The su preme criterion in the creation of law is the consideration of the com mon good. Laws are the instrument by which the ruler promotes the common good of his subjects effectively, since they constitute rules of action. "Praeses facer? d?bet," Lucas declares, "quicquid omnino est publico et civitatibus utile."134 He admits that this effect cannot always be achieved towards all the members of the community, but he declares that it is sufficient when the law fulfills this criterion to wards the majority of the people: "Si forte non omnibus utilis est . . . sufficit tarnen, si majori parti, nulla enim lex satis commoda est."135 He considers it advisable to state plainly ? probably with contempo rary conditions in mind ? that legislators must not create law for the sake of their own or their officials' private advantage, because "lex enim nullo privato statuentis commodo, sed pro communi bono ponenda est."136 But he recommends, in order to deprive law of this type of private effects and provided that it is useful to the whole or the majority of the community, that "lex ubique d?bet virtutem suam extendere ... constitutio personalis habenda est pro generali."137 Another indispensable requirement is the conformity of law with nature: "Subjungo, quod lex a natura deviare non d?bet."138 He hastens to add that it is not divine nature, but rather human nature with which law has to conform : "Intellige naturam humanam potius quam divinam."139 In other words, he requires conformity with what is usual or normal. This is made clear by the emphasis he lays on the necessity of considering legislative precedents, for in his view a grad i32 C. xi, 46, 1 no. 14 and Policraticus, iii, 15. It is significant that Lucas does not refer to John's later passage (viii, 20) in which he cancelled his previous advice to the tyranny-ridden people and suggested falling back on prayers for the tyrant instead of murdering him. 133 Cf. the paper of F.

The legislator will only then succeed in creating laws which will prove beneficial to his people and which will serve as a feasible rule of action, if he takes account of the existing prevalent ideas about justice and equity. That is the meaning of the otherwise misleading passage : "Leges nulla alia causa nos tenent quam quod judicio populi sunt receptae . . . nam et lex d?bet anterioribus exemplis submitti. . . id enim quod usitatum non est, fieri non potest."140 In short, laws by establishing rules of action should regard the limitations of human nature. Since laws are considered as the supreme guide in social relations they have, thirdly, to be based on a "ratio" ; that is to say, that which is reasonable from the point of view of society and that which aims at promoting the common good, has to be made a rule of action by the promulgation of laws: "Lex d?bet rationem omnimodam continere, immo est summa ratio."141 Thus Lucas comes to justify the treat ment of casus omissi on grounds of an hypothetically anticipated leg islative act : "Quod rationabile est, d?bet in jus perfectum deduci . . . unde idem jus servandum est, licet statutum non sit, quia verisimile est statutum fuisse, si hoc quaesitum fuisset."142 Furthermore, admin istrators of law have to take cognizance of changed social conditions which of necessity entail a change of the interpretation of the "ratio legis." "Procedendum est," Lucas counsels, "secundum varietatem rationis, quod enim fuit uno tempore rationable, variata causa posset esse irrationabile."143 But the ruler of the state is not entitled to change laws at his own discretion as long as social conditions and the "ratio" of the law remain unchanged.144 In general, the law "jubet ea, quae facienda sunt, prohibet ea, quae contraria."145 Following John of Salisbury, the Neapolitan demands and expects from the legislator that his "leges sacras regulas sequi."146 140 C. x, 28, 1 no. 5, repeated in several other places. 141 C. x, 5, 2 no. 9, referring to St. Augustine's De libero arbitrio, lib. i. *42 Ibid., no. 9. 143 Different social conditions call for different laws.

But strangely enough, Lucas asserts that the conflicting civil law is valid, if the legislator inserts a clause to the effect that notwithstanding the opposing law his law should be valid. But even so, the new law cannot abrogate, but only derogate the law with which it is in conflict. The validity in these cases, Lucas maintains without giving adequate reasons, was an effluence of the ruler's will, and was not grounded in the lack of authority: "Et sic magis ex defectu voluntatis principis quam potentiae."149 These con siderations of Lucas seem to be more speculative than practical, since he himself conceives the ruler as subjected to natural and divine law and, furthermore, since human law can only derogate and by no means abrogate laws of a higher order. Lastly, the ruler is conceived by him as directly responsible to God for any transgressions of his legislative powers by making inroads on divine or natural law. On the other hand, full abrogative effect is attributed to human legislation, if the ruler as law-giver inserts the above mentioned clause in a new law which is in conflict with civil law : here then the old civil law is abol ished to all intents and purposes, an effect which the ruler cannot produce, even if he wanted to, as regards divine or natural law.150 In order to fulfill its function, law necessarily imposes restrictions on the free display of human activity.151 Law provides the mightiest wibid., no. 14. 148 C. x, 40, 9 no. 29 : "Leges etiam si sint directe contrariae canonibus, tarnen servandae sunt in foro civili, ubi possunt sine periculo animae observan . . . nam servantur ca?ones in foro ecclesiastico."

In this way he imagines that social and civil servi tude, "the image of death,"154 can be evaded and the aim of social life be realized, namely, liberty which is the "lumen vitae nostrae."155 Finally, Lucas repudiates the idea that law exempts any individual from its observance. The head of the state, therefore, is not excluded. On the contrary, he above all has to set an example to his subjects by scrupulously strict observance of the laws which are to be a guide to his subjects no less than to himself : "Officium enim cuiusque regentis non solum in danda, sed etiam in observanda disciplina consistit," Lucas declares and continues : "Omnes enim decet obedire legibus et secundum eas vivere, et omnes obediant legi et succumbant justitiae sanctioni. Imperator quippe recte et competenter exornare d?bet traditam sibi rem publicam."156 The conduct of the head of the state should not be repugnant to the spirit and content of the laws, the cre ation of which is his vocational office : "Optandum est, ut hi, qui rei publicae praesunt, legum similes sunt."157 Nevertheless, Lucas is aware of the importance of the Roman dictum that "princeps legibus solutus est," but he interprets it in a way that deserves mention. The meaning of this dictum is, according to him, that there is no need to subject the ruler to the external force of law, since he is presumed to govern on the basis of his innate sense of justice.158 The presentation of the theory of law as expounded by the Nea politan doctor, Lucas de Penna, will have revealed his attempt to formulate a general theory of the foundations of the whole legal order. His doctrines permit of the conclusion that he viewed legal rules as the expression of the contemporary philosophical outlook on life ; they 152 c. x, 70, 4 no. 6. 153 C. x, 31-33 no. 33 : "Infirmorum auxilia, potentiorum frena." 154 c. xii, 63, 1 no. 73V2.

His disquisitions show his en deavors to explain the law of his time on the basis of Christian moral philosophy. Orientation of thought and methodology are at once unequalled and original.
