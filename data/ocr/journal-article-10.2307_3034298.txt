<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEANING: ONTOGENY AND CULTURE A.F. ROBERTSON University of Caltfornia, Santa Barbara If bio-cultural studies are to progress, we must find means of inserting the agency of human lives between the rival temporal schemes of evolution and history. This article starts from the neglected biological notion of ontogeny, and extends it to fit the sociality which is so essential to our life as a species. A viable model of human development must account for the life course in its entirety, including the aging process. It should view the life cycle not within the encapsulated notion of individuality, but within the context of the social relations of reproduction. The bio-cultural unit is not the static, modal, psychically integral, ungendered, ego-centred individual; it is aprocess within which persons are formed and dissolved, move between dependent impotence and independent authority, divide and multiply their being through relations with others, know more and less about the world, and acquire and lose the capacity to change it. This is the medium in which meanings, the stuff of culture, are formed, perpetuated and changed. This article is prompted by a sequence of contributions to this Journal which have been concerned to close the gaps between biology and social anthropol- ogy1 The nature-culture opposition remains 'the very matrix of Western metaphysics' (Benoist 1973: 20) and to the extent that it defines the division of academic labour, it has become a fundamental obstacle to communication be- tween the natural sciences and the humanities. If any discipline can straddle the gap it should be anthropology, with its four classic sub-fields extending from biology to linguistics. But the schism runs deeply through anthropology itself: the old debates about society and culture have hardened into divergent ideologies of materialism and idealism, and in some academic institutions a partitioning of the subject between science and the humanities is already under way.2 In a premature 'choice' characteristic of the 'two cultures' in our society, my own formal education in science ended when I was fourteen years old. As I struggle to make sense of how the temporalities of evolution, human history and the mundane rhythms of our individual lives are interconnected, I am painfully aware that the biology I need to know is separated from the social science I have learned by everything from vocabulary to 'causal structures' (Boyer 1994: 296; Lerner &amp; Hultsch 1983: 46). Anyone seeking to bridge the nature-culture gap, whether in the spirit of amity or conquest, must certainly be bold (Midgley 1995: xiii). The ideological brickbats fly: the natural scientists are castigated for their determinism, for subjecting the human spirit to biologistic 'constraints' of their own devising, for saddling men and women with unattrac- tive 'evolutionary tasks' (see Lancaster 1985: 10), and for urging an imperial J.

The critical faction in anthropology urges disen- gagement: students of culture, says Sahlins, need take little interest in biology, beyond recognizing that it places 'a set of natural limits on human functioning' and 'puts at the disposition of culture a set of means for the construction of a symbolic order' (Sahlins 1976: 66). Such dismissive attitudes are ridiculed by natural scientists, who see the interpretation of culture as vacuously detached from the 'real world', bogged down in aimless relativism, and in imminent danger of disappearing into its own subjective reflections. They would argue that relativism rests on tacit acceptance of bio-universals (mating, infant de- pendency, male dominance, and so forth) without which cultural specificity itself would have little meaning.3 With the recognition that variation, as cultural anthropology's most distinctive concern, has been 'grossly exaggerated' (Bloch 1991: 184-5), many anthropologists feel, once again, the need to regard human beings as something more than 'Blank Paper' (Midgley 1995: 3-4) on which infinitely diverse meanings can be inscribed. Meanwhile, biologists who ac- knowledge the potency of human social systems seek a similar rapprochement: 'Our behaviour is caused neither by biology nor by culture, because we are a product of both' (Hinde 1991: 604).4 So far, attempts at synthesis have been cast very much within the Darwinian framework, emphasizing codetermination in biological and cultural evolution.5 These efforts are dogged by the qualitative difference between physical struc- tures ('nature') and the structures of ideas ('cultures'), and by formidable conceptual problems of time and scale: the need to make immense speculative leaps from microbiology to macrosociology, and to reconcile the very gradual evolution of our species and the vertiginous speed of cultural change (see Klein 1989: 344; Stini 1991: 208). There is a vast analytical gap between the cultural diversity of today's human populations and assumptions about the singular genetic constitution of 'modern man' in an 'Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness' (see Symons 1995: 85) some 50-100,000 years ago (Kitahara 1991; Klein 1989: 34). This 'Moment' in evolution (Dobzhansky &amp; Boesiger 1983: 64) is said to have constructed our physical selves, including certain capacities of the brain which distinguish us radically from all other animals. Our intellec- tual malaise about the extent to which these ancient endowments elevate us in the animal kingdom is our most persistent philosophical problem. Is culture biological - 'to put the matter as succinctly as possible' (Wilson &amp; Lumsden 1991: 403)? Or is it an 'outgrowth and supplement' of the ways we are biologi- cally programmed (Midgley 1995: 286, 51)? Has culture put a stop to our organic development (Goldschmidt 1993: 343), or has it actually shaped our physical evolution (Geertz 1973: 43-51)? Can genetics explain something so circumstantial as how revolutions are organized (Green 1991), or how chiefs on a Pacific island rule (Betzig 1988)? What do we mean if we admit, more grudg- ingly, that 'at least some kinds of social knowledge' are genetically programmed (Hirschfeld 1988: 616)? If 'genetic and cultural factors interact' in a process of 'coevolution', how do we sort out which factor 'predisposes' us to what sort of behaviour (Lopreato 1984: 33, 344)? If 'everything, from the most delicate nuance of Richard Strauss's last performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony to the presence of calcium salts in his bones at birth, is totally and to exactly the</page><page sequence="3">A.F. ROBERTSON 593 same extent genetically and environmentally codetermined' (Tooby &amp; Cosmides 1992: 84), is there any point in trying to theorize the difference? For the bio-social scientist, reaching back into the liminal period in which our physical evolution was 'ending' and our cultures were 'beginning' has involved some intricate conceptual juggling.6 Arguments tend to be regressive, tracing a contemporary human trait 'back' to speculations about our distant ancestors or our simian cousins. Attempts to adduce evidence from primate studies in the explanation of human behaviour have been dogged by anthropomorphism, the ascription of faculties which appear analogous but are not homologous - such as 'thinking', 'working' and 'loving' (Midgley 1995: 344-51). A favourite device is to focus on extant human populations which seem most closely to resemble those of the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness, the vestigial hunter- gatherers on the periphery of today's world. However, this does little to reduce the conceptual gap between 'biologically modern' denizens of deserts or tropical rainforests and 'socially modern' city dwellers.7 Again, while traits reportedly ubiquitous ('universal') in present-day societies (incest prohibitions, marriage, or the diffuse phenomenon of 'ritual') are readily attributed to the ancient biological unity of our species, evolutionary theorists are no less adept at offer- ing functional explanations for quirky institutions such as polyandry.8 In these imaginative excursions, the explanatory powers of Darwinian evolutionism tend to be dissipated in metaphoric transfers, most notoriously the idea of 'fitness'.9 Dawkins's proposal of the 'meme' as a social analogue of the gene is a mala- propism of the same sort (1989: 189-201). The belief that the gap between the microbiological and the macrosociological can be closed within our own skulls has disposed bio-social scientists to hunt for psychological mechanisms which impart 'evolutionarily patterned content to modern human life' (Tooby &amp; Cosmides 1992: 50). Thus, Tooby and Cosmides argue that because 'the component parts of the population are individual humans, so any social dynamics must be anchored in models of the human psychological architecture' (1992: 47). However, the 'artificer' (see Symons 1989; 1992) which links our genetic endowments and our cultures is not so much the hardware of the 'brain' as the elaborate software of 'mind'. To view the latter simply as 'information-processing mechanisms instantiated in the hu- man nervous system' which have evolved 'in ancestral environments' does little to close the gap between how we think and what we think (Tooby &amp; Cosmides 1992: 24). Tooby and Cosmides's remedy is the insertion of a new sort of abstraction, 'a single human metaculture' which - given sufficient time and analytical ingenuity - may be detected as the basis of all specific cultural con- texts (1992: 90-1, 118). If 'metaculture' does the basic thinking for culture, this comes perilously close to the sorts of mentalist fallacy (culture with a mind of its own) from which bio-social scientists such as Tooby and Cosmides shrink. It is ironic that the merger of Darwinian theory and cognitive psychology should have gravitated to diffusionist models of culture, the cybernetically- imagined migration of cultural fragments from one brain to another, rather than to interpretations of individual cognitive development in its social contexts.10 Darwinian theory remains remote from the unfolding lives of the individual people who labour over many years to form and perpetuate the social systems on which we all depend. Although it may be 'in' human nature to make our</page><page sequence="4">594 A.F. ROBERTSON own history (Lewontin et al. 1984: 14-15), human agency at this temporal and political level has scarcely been touched by attempts to theorize the social im- plications of an evolved psyche. For the relativist, of course, history remains completely detached from human nature, encapsulated within culture where it is protected from disquieting questions of biological influence. The physiologi- cal bases of our mental dispositions evolved too long ago to afford a plausible account of the diversity and mutability of cultures today. If we wish to understand the relationship between history and human nature the time has come to set aside these dogmatic schisms and envisage a process in which the making of human history and the making of human lives coincide. Human ontogeny and sociality 'In the higher animals, such as ourselves, the whole life course is attended by constant alteration and modification of form' (Thompson 1942: 199). How can we ignore this fact when we contemplate the vast array of complex institutions which surround us? Can they be so very far removed from the turbulence of birth, copulation and death which dominates our being? Apparently it is scale which deceives us: social history, the collective thoughts and actions of so many thousands of us, make our individual comings and goings seem irrelevant. To attempt to disaggregate the form and functions of a banking corporation or a national government into the physical exigencies of our individual lives is intel- lectually vertiginous. We simply do not have the theoretical apparatus to undertake such a task.11 Biologists who have shown any interest in explaining social institutions have done so at the all-inclusive level of phylogeny - arguing, as it were, 'down' from the species as a whole to the sorts of collective activity which occur in particular environments. Arguing 'up' from ontogeny, the devel- opment of the individual organism is, to say the least, unfashionable.12 Growth at this phenotypic level is usually expounded with reference to a set of evolved morphological characteristics such as expanded brain size and up- right bipedal posture. Dynamically, the most noted feature is protracted infancy, a pattern of reproduction which makes the incapacitated newcomer profoundly dependent, most immediately on its mother. In terms of human ontogeny as a whole, this is better framed as neoteny, a retardation of physical development and a slowing of the life course, which permits the growth and deployment of our bigger brains. The implications of this extend far beyond infancy: 'Human development is so strongly retarded that even mature adults retain sufficient [neurological] flexibility for our adaptive status as a learning animal' (Gould 1977: 404). The biological view of ontogeny has been limited to the reproductive func- tions of the single organism in its relationship to species development. For humans especially, this is too narrow.13 Human reproduction is based on the 'fact' of sexual dimorphism, but gender is a developmental sequence: there is a much-reported divergence in the qualities associated with 'femininity' and 'masculinity' as people progress from childhood to adulthood, and a subsequent reduction in gender discrimination in the post-reproductive phase.14 But our development as social animals gives us further reason to extend our definition of ontogeny to the wider relations of reproduction.15 Our 'sociophilic' disposi- tion as infants (Goldschmidt 1993: 347) entails expanding 'intersubjectivity'</page><page sequence="5">A.F. ROBERTSON 595 (Hinde 1991: 586), the cumulative effect of which is the 'sociality and tradition' (Comfort 1966: 41) for which we are famous as a species. Our basic image of human ontogeny should therefore be that of a lifespan set between an ascendent and a descendent generation, linked by the process of begetting and being begotten (see fig. 1). But we must also think of it as a complete lifespan. 'Sex', Wilson assures us 'is central to human biology' (1978: 121); but in the Darwinian paradigm '[w]hat happens later, in the postreproductive period, is theoretically outside the reach of selection, and irrelevant to it' (Comfort 1979: 44). Biologists tend to regard the ontogenetic process as complete when we have acquired the sexual and social capacities to produce and rear offspring. But human development does not end at this stage. If our genes appear to have little 'interest' in our survival past 'middle age', we as human individuals assuredly do (Comfort 1979: 1-2). Biologists have construed this terminal stage very narrowly as 'senescence', the period - too short in most of the animal kingdom to be noteworthy - of declining sexual capacity ending in death.16 Comfort observes that aging has 'often been regarded as an evolved adaptation, rather than as an inherent result of having a body' (Comfort 1979: 46). A longer lifespan correlates with our particular combination of mammalian brain and body size (Stini 1991: 228), but its current extent and the speed with which this has been attained belong in the domain of historical rather than biological time.17 While physiologists continue to debate the causes and consequences of extended human senescence, in- creased life expectancy is more obviously attributable to the agricultural and industrial revolutions of the last few centuries than to our genetic endowment. The shifting weight of the modern population which, through advanced age, is less concerned with matters of sexuality and reproduction than somatic survival and consumption has political and economic implications which are now at- tracting copious attention. 18 ascendent generation (birth) (maturation) (death) lifespan descendent generation FIGURE 1. Ontogeny: the human lifespan in intergenerational context.</page><page sequence="6">596 A.F. ROBERTSON According to Comfort, 'Throughout its history the study of ageing ... has been ruinously obscured by theory' (1979: 17). In a period which amounts to less than one potential lifespan (around a hundred years) the proportion of people approaching this limit has increased dramatically. We are just beginning to assess the implications, for the newborn, of a social environment peopled, as never before in human experience, with grandparents and, increasingly, great- grandparents (Anderson 1985: 70-5). To the extent that 'becoming a person is a matter of gathering those relations into the structures of consciousness' (Ingold 1990: 221) we differ significantly from our immediate ancestors. However, the connexion between culture and aging is not simply a historical novelty. The fact that some persons have always lived to great age is of major importance in understanding the history of human cultures: It is clear throughout phylogeny that there is a relation between survival into the senile period and the existence of a social mode of life. In some cases longevity has evolved as a prerequisite of social organization, in others social organization itself increases the possibility of survival into old age, while the social group very possibly draws adaptive benefits from the existence of old individuals. Both these trends appear to be at work in social primates. The potential life-span in palaeolithic man probably resembled our own: its realization has been possible through the development of complex social behavior (Comfort 1979: 321-2). Biological interest in human development has ended at the stage when the production and transfer of culture becomes most interesting. In his introduc- tion to a recent collection of anthropological essays on aging, Spencer (1990: 6) argues that cultural development is a concomitant of the extension of the lifespan. Evolution has brought a shift 'from physical supremacy of young adults - an ability to contest in direct encounters - to the moral supremacy of their elders'. 'Rudimentary families' of primates become the extended kin sys- tem of mankind, with a parallel moralizing of intergenerational relations. The shift from 'internecine destructiveness' to savvied alliance-building is 'a prob- lem which forms the basis of political science': a distinction between 'short-term physical solutions that would favour some younger men in their prime and long-term diplomatic solutions for young and old alike' (Spencer 1990: 6). It is the social strategies of aging which subvert Darwin's image of virile brute strength running the herd; among the Samburu in East Africa studied by Spencer it is the aging polygynist who prevails. Ontogeny: an underdeveloped concept 'Cultural evolution is Lamarckian and very fast', writes E.O. Wilson (1978: 78), 'whereas biological evolution is Darwinian and usually very slow'. This associa- tion of cultural development with a defunct biogenetic theory is of more than passing interest. The priorities are plain: 'there is a limit, perhaps closer to the practices of contemporary societies than we have had the wit to grasp, beyond which biological evolution will begin to pull cultural evolution back to itself' (Wilson 1978: 78). The triumph of Darwinian theory, which 'explained evolution according to the chances of death or survival of millions of individuals' (Smith 1995: 28) has cost us a clear understanding of those manifold life processes in which culture inheres (and much of the vital detail of genotypical development as well - see Ingold 1990: 214; Keller 1987: 393, 395; Oyama 1985). Evolution may make</page><page sequence="7">A.F. ROBERTSON 597 species but, as Lamarck was guilty of insisting, individual lives make species evolve. Although the term 'evolution' was first applied to the growth of each organism, the significance of development at this level has been displaced by the Darwinian preoccupation with phylogeny (Gould 1977: 28-32). Ontogeny and phylogeny are now contrasted rather than linked,19 and our ability to argue their relationship to culture has fallen between the two stools. We must blame August Weismann for closing prematurely one of the most productive debates in biology. 'If, as he claimed, acquired characters are not inherited, then the processes by which organisms develop can be treated as if they were in a black box. The box will be opened one day, but in the meantime we can get on with genetics and evolution theory' (Smith 1995: 28).20 'Mean- time', in the hands of cognitive psychologists and others, ontogeny has been transferred, sealed in its black box, to the skull of the newborn infant. Studies of the brain-culture connexion, such as those envisaged by Boyer (1994), re- main entrenched in early childhood, far from the 'senescent' stage which is so vital for the definition and continuity of culture, as anthropologists have per- ceived it.21 Unpacking the mental apparatus of the child does not tell us enough about the deployment of mind in adulthood, in the different context of a sexu- ally mature body and of increasingly dense social intercourse.22 Nor does it help us discriminate between such things as the capacity to learn language and to use it suasively (see, for example, Smillie 1991). Scientific speculation on such matters drifts rapidly into metaphor. The initial images are usually electro-mechanical: 'The newborn infant is now seen to be wired with awesome precision ... This marvelous robot is launched into the world under the care of its parents' (Wilson 1978: 54). The black box is imagined as a sophisticated personal computer, ready to install and run the software of social life. As the organism grows, Wilson's imagery changes to that of a hydraulic landscape: information patterns ramify out along shallower channels 'as increasing amounts of learning and culture come to prevail on the downward slopes' of maturity. With senility on the horizon, 'the landscape dissolves into a vast delta of low ridges and winding oxbows' (Wilson 1978: 63). By the time the ontogenetic black box reaches the hands of the cultural anthropologist it is empty. In this view the preformed infant mind is a conven- ient receptacle for culture, which it is the business of organized society in its multifarious forms to provide. There is little need to contemplate the relation- ship between physical growth and personal engagement, over time, in the production and reproduction of culture. Sahlins's postulation that 'the socio- biological reasoning from evolutionary phylogeny to social morphology is interrupted by culture' (1976: 11) is predicated on a relationship between 'social morphology' and 'culture' which is far from clear. If we regard culture as an object of social enquiry rather than a barrier to it, we can propose that social and biological explanation is mediated (not obstructed) by a different sort of process: human growth. It is at this level that we can explore the relationship between physical needs and capacities, the immediacies of individual action and identity, and the abstraction of 'culture' on the grand scale. As Ingold laments: 'the dominant neo-Darwinian paradigm in evolutionary biology has no place for the organism; likewise traditional cultural anthropology has no place for the person' (1990: 224). Anthropologists - 'materialists' and 'idealists' alike - still operate</page><page sequence="8">598 A.F. ROBERTSON with a notion of the modal individual which parallels the homeostatic images of the healthy mature adult in physiology; in both cases our perception of the vital relationships between youth and age disappear in the composite cultural or physiological snapshot (Comfort 1979: 331, 251-2). Where persons are regarded as socially constructed entities, rather than as organisms which have in large meas- ure to construct themselves, we are left with that famous vicious sociocentric circle in which ultimately all that can explain the dynamism of culture is culture itself (Boyer 1994: 296). From ontogeny to culture The model of development I am pursuing is neither that of a humanoid ma- chine for transporting genes into culture, nor of an empty receptacle for cultural influences in the shape of a human life-course. I wish rather to visual- ize the process in which physique and meaning grow simultaneously, the interaction of an evolved body developing in a historical context. The mental capacities which, however delineated, biologists and anthropolo- gists know to be peculiarly and indispensably human, inhere in the transmission of meanings among persons through time. It is the accumulation of these meanings which we identify as 'culture', but this in turn is sustained only, and ultimately, by virtue of the physical reproduction of people. Developmental meaning is an aspect of all social institutions, and should be represented clearly in our descriptions of them. We reduce our understanding of culture to images of self-sustaining inertia (culture-begets-culture) if we detach it from individual lives.23 And if we detach our individual lives from explanations of our develop- ment as a species, our essential humanity will remain beyond our comprehension (Ingold 1990; 1991b). As Toren remarks, 'we cannot make meaning in a way which is non-social' (1993a: 467). Meaning is not formed until it has been communicated (new meaning which, by some psychic process of 'telling', remains in the individual mind is culturally irrelevant). Although our experience of meaning in action may well seem 'instantaneous', its consolidation and reproduction among large groups of people is a protracted process. Culture is thus a complex illusion: it is never permanent, never finally accomplished, because its meanings have to be affirmed and reaffirmed in the lives of individuals. It has no objective reality because it cannot be encompassed by a single mind; its constituents have only a partial existence in the mind of any individual, and many understandings of each fragment of culture may pass through that individual's mind during his or her lifetime. The propagation of culture depends upon the relations of reproduction - and vice versa.24 This intergenerational process depends on churches and schools, banks and governments as well as on families, households and local communities. Meanings are very fluid and fragmented in the short-term contingent interac- tions among friends within generations (we tend to call these 'sub-cultures'). But organizing reproduction is a process extending through many decades, locking individual pragmatics into social history. Since reproduction concerns our physical continuity through time and space, assumptions about the general stability of the process are very important to us. Ironically, we impute the highest degree of moral constancy to groups in which change is most endemic</page><page sequence="9">A.P. ROBERTSON 599 - conspicuously 'The Family'. But to the extent that all institutions ultimately depend on the social organization of reproduction, they must all be fortified by illusions of permanence. Banks or governments are no exception: their marble pillars studiously deny our ephemerality and their own ultimate impermanence. The analytical challenge is to disaggregate these historically consolidated mean- ings and activities, and to reveal how they are animated by the rhythms of human life.25 Meaning is not something which adults dump, ready-made, into the brains of children: 'humans are biologically structured to be at once products and pro- ducers of their own, collective and personal, histories' (Toren 1993a: 474).26 The social matrix in which the individual takes and makes meaning is in con- stant flux: subjectively in the process which turns brains into minds within changing bodies, and objectively in the process by which meanings are per- ceived collectively as history. The grand implication of this is that 'a comparative anthropology of mind requires the recognition that ontogeny is a genuinely historical process' (Toren 1993a: 461). But the converse is no less true: history itself is a function of human ontogeny. Subjectively, human lives proceed as unfolding experience and the construc- tion of understandings, an active process of interrogation, speculation and efforts to resolve the inconsistencies between knowledge and experience. In physical terms, our material interests change in parallel with our developing needs and capacities. But there is also, as Lewis observes, 'a developmental pattern in belief'; we do not hold all our ideas with the same degree of convic- tion and we certainly do not do so throughout our lives (1986: 414, 423). To borrow a Levi-Straussian image, all people have to 'cook' their owvn culture by re-communicating it within the confines of their own experience, changing its objective consistency in some small degree as they do so. Society and self are redefined simultaneously in the experiential transformations from 'child' to 'mother', or from 'youth' to 'elder'. It is impossible to define father' in anything but processual terms. Personality in its subjective and objective dimensions gradually develops, as individuals become more differentiated both physically and socially (Stini 1991: 208). Subjectively, the progressive embodiment of sen- timent helps us to put the elusive topic of emotion into social context.27 Love is not a state, ascribed by culture in some generalized terms; it is the name we give to various sorts of gratification as our own lives intertwine with others. Meaning is ontogenetic, but not in the sense of a simple accumulation of knowledge in individual minds. The early stages of life are concerned emphati- cally with its acquisition, the middle stages with its consolidation in social experience, the later stages with its formal definition and transfer. Human growth segregates temporally the need to learn and the need to teach, and distributes power accordingly. This affects the substance of pedagogy, not sim- ply its methods: the aged offer instruction on youth, but young people do not offer instruction on aging. In learning how to use their brains in particular social contexts, children do not advance towards some universal adult rational- ity (whatever that might be). Rather, they develop useful, socially specific rationales. In this regard, our ability to forget, so conspicuous in our earliest years, may be one of our most useful adaptations (Boyer 1994: x; Spear &amp; Campbell 1979). Knowledge is not simply an accretion: much of it is ephemeral,</page><page sequence="10">600 A.F. ROBERTSON plastic, serving a particular life-stage (Lerner &amp; Hultsch 1983: 485). The phe- nomenon of 'infantile amnesia' has its senile parallel, expressed in a greater capacity to retrieve older, more thoroughly reinforced memories, and a ten- dency to resolve preferred social values into expressed facts. The intergenerational transaction of meaning is intricately - but not exclu- sively - bound up in the development and use of language (Bloch 1991: 184-6). Listening to a story and telling it (or observing a ritual and doing it) are two quite different processes in the ordering and ascription of meaning, and are separated in developmental experience. As people and as anthropologists, we have always sought the authorized version, almost invariably by consulting older and more experienced storytellers. The gravitation towards orthodoxy is vital to any institution, but this cannot detract from the fact that the story is constructed, sustained and altered in its passage between many minds, and through the divergent understandings of the young and the old, women and men. The significance of this for general cultural understandings is affirmed in Toren's studies of childhood in Fiji (1993a; 1993b). It is not simply that little minds must struggle to come to terms with adult meanings, for adult meanings are themselves modulated by the fact that they developed through childish understandings. In adulthood, meanings are consolidated in routinized action and interaction, a balancing of the experimental and prospective mind of youth, and the conser- vative and retrospective mind of age. The immediate responsibility for offspring turns mature adults into retailers of meaning, which puts them into a somewhat ambiguous relationship with their own elders: the need for each generation to assemble and defend its own understandings, versus increasing empathy with seniors as each generation itself ages (Holy 1990: 180-1; Woodward 1995: 87- 91). Culture, at least as anthropologists perceive it, is essentially a geriatric phenomenon. The tidy authorized version is found in the resolved mind of the experienced adult, not in the tentative, experimental imaginings of youth. Psych- ologists have speculated about the need for retrospective order, to place self in wider time-space co-ordinates, which increases with age (Erikson 1985: 61-6; Lerner &amp; Hultsch 1983: 443-85). The effect is hegemonic: elders may either claim, or be credited with, far more knowledge than they actually possess, and reinforce their credibility with the profession of supernatural powers.28 This may compensate for dwindling physical powers, increasing dependency and a need to retain access to material resources to assure survival. However, the 'crystallized intelligence' of age (Lerner &amp; Hultsch 1983: 484) is undoubtedly the repository of publicly valuable information, which one might expect in- creasing longevity to enhance.29 These different understandings of older and younger people are a source of confusion in cultural analysis.30 There is, for example, a deeply-rooted tendency to assume that an ontogenetic difference in meaning is evidence of historical change. Justifying the urgent need to record customs in the Torres Straits, Haddon declared that 'When I began to question the natives I discovered that the young men had a very imperfect acquaintance with the old habits and beliefs, and that only from older men was reliable information to be obtained' (1890: 297). Like many anthropologists after him, Haddon assumed that the inability of young men to pontificate meant that traditions were about to die out and needed to be 'saved' by urgent ethnographic attention to the 'reliable' elders.</page><page sequence="11">A.F. ROBERTSON 601 While the ontogenetic frame 'deconstructs' culture by revealing its divergent meanings in individual lives, it also enables us to reconstruct the process by which meanings are assembled and reshaped. Genetic processes no longer make a meaningless migration out into the social domain, 'causing' wars or mono- gamous marriage; they take effect in processes of bodily growth. Nor does culture exist in some disembodied domain 'out there', suffusing our brains as we mature; meaning is made within the body in its progression through birth to death and beyond. To the extent that human bodies develop in fundamentally the same way, and that culture inheres in the reproduction of those bodies, cultural variation is finite. This proposition will be met with indifference or hostility by anthropologists who confine their attention to culturalforms, the specification of meaning in the context of particular social institutions. But for those who are interested in culture as process, and are concerned to discover why meanings come to take one form rather than some other, such a generalizing premiss is essential. The materialist approach has been to place human societies in a single historical framework and hypothesize that they are differentiated by progressive technical development and changing relationships to the means of production. The biologist's urge to find a common denominator at the level of our species must confront Sahlins's complaint that this is too inclusive to say anything interesting or reliable about variation in cultural detail. There is in- deed little to be gained from attempting to measure off diverse cultural forms against some general morphology of human nature. What is required is a medi- ating process which relates the formation of human bodies to the formation of human ideas. This missing level of explanation does not diminish the marvel- lous variety and complexity of behaviour as anthropologists perceive it. But by allowing us to explain how organic growth actually interacts with social com- plexity it helps to reveal the means by which all human societies construct their diverse histories. Obuko In Buganda, adults have a fear, visceral in its intensity, of the pollution known as obuko. Anthropologists would readily identify it as symptomatic of the re- markable rituals of affinal relationship common throughout this region, in which the aggressive joking behaviour required of brothers-in-law is matched by rigorous parent-in-law avoidance. Describing obuko synchronically as a set of rules and regulations underlying this behaviour says very little about its emo- tional power or its motive force in Ganda economic history. Viewing obuko developmentally allows us to trace its implications far beyond the range of the family, and to make comparisons with dangerous aspects of reproduction in other societies. Children come to terms with obuko at puberty through dire warnings about the profound incompatibility of their own sexual activities and the physical proximity of their parents. Whatever we may have felt about sneaky adolescent intimacy under the parental roof is amplified by the Ganda into a mortal dread. Because a married couple must not live with their parents, Ganda households do not ramify to include three or more coresident generations, but break up quite early, the youngsters moving out to set up households on their own. Within the formal relations of marriage obuko becomes a potent marker of the</page><page sequence="12">602 A.F. ROBERTSON moral and physical distance between affines of adjacent generations. If parents have to visit, they must be accommodated separately, either with neighbours or in the most distant corner of the farm. It is at this juncture in the relations of reproduction that obuko is at its prime. The abomination contrasts markedly with grandparental relations, which are characteristically warm and involve often protracted visits from the grandchildren. This dynamic image of obuko serves to link two radically estranged meanings of 'development': growth in a somatic sense, and political-economic progress in a historical sense. During this century, the fissile programme of domestic devel- opment in Buganda has had far-reaching economic implications: the relentless colonization and resettlement of land by young people; the expansion of non- familial political and welfare structures which such dispersion promotes; and above all the urgent pressure for material accumulation during the early stages of the domestic cycle as young people seek their independence, which helped to make Buganda the power-house of economic growth in the region. However, polygynous expansion makes the early fission of Ganda households all the more dramatic. Family-farm enterprises fall rapidly into decline - to the great dismay of agricultural officials who have nurtured 'Progressive Farmers' through their prime. The problem of the elderly relict in the region is also notorious, but this reveals a further temporal quirk in obuko: its force evidently 'decays' with aging, to the extent that an elderly dependent parent may find accommodation quite innocuously with a married son or daughter, perhaps because they are regarded as asexual or childlike.31 To abstract obuko from the social relations of reproduction as they develop through time would obliterate its moral and historical dynamism. It might be said that its biological implications (concerning incest, adultery, and so forth) make it too obvious an example for the present discussion. However, as I have argued elsewhere, essentially the same developmental logic can be applied to modern economic institutions which we do not imagine as having any repro- ductive functions. For example, much of the business of major banking corporations is geared to the fact that clients are mortal, and that the pattern of borrowing, saving, insuring and pensioning changes over the individual lifespan. Indeed, the development of banking itself can be traced to the dyna- mism of these interests in particular historical contexts (Robertson 1991: 73-92). Conclusion: reinterpreting development I have argued that to progress beyond the bio-cultural impasse we must find means of inserting the agency of human lives between the rival temporal schemes of evolution and history. A version of ontogeny, 'the inherently orderly but contingent coming into being' (Oyama 1985: 3), is the link. I have in mind a revised notion of human development which will allow our thinking about culture and physiology to converge on essentially the same schema. It must sustain integrity of meaning between the disciplinary domains, avoiding meta- phoric slippage from one to the other.32 But it should not in itself masquerade as grand theory. Its utility is as a mediating construct which should help dissolve many of the classic conceptual oppositions which have obstructed our thinking: the distinctions between body and mind, instinct and consciousness, organism</page><page sequence="13">A.F. ROBERTSON 603 and person, individuality and sociality, rationality and emotion, the material and the symbolic. A revised view of development must be intelligible both in the 'objective' domain of science and the 'subjective' domains of human experience. It should be able to take cues from intellectual traditions other than our own, which have different means of putting humanity into its natural context. For anthropologists, I have insisted that a revised understanding of human development is indispensable to any explanation of how meanings are sustained in time and disposed in social space. So many brilliant observations about the human condition seem to me skewed, polarized and inert because of the failure to apprehend the essential rhythm of life. While the developmental perspective seems essential to the study of kinship, rites of passage, or the acquisition of knowledge and skills, I have been concerned to extend it to less obvious matters such as the development of capitalism and social class formation (Robertson 1987; 1991: 93-105). The developmental framework provides clearer coordi- nates for arguments about the relationships between action and structure, most particularly for those which have looked to the human body as a vehicle for social praxis.33 Such investigations might help us close the gap between assumptions about the biologically-contained selfishness of genes and the socially-contained self- ishness of people. Human development is on the one hand more 'contemporary' and less immutable than biological notions of ontogeny portray; and on the other hand, more uniform and less capriciously various than cultural relativists will allow. I cannot presume to say much about the pay-off for biol- ogy, but it seems that the time has come for a thorough reappraisal of 'ontogeny' as a biogenetic construct.34 'Occasionally someone has said that our science will be transformed when it incorporates development: I have even said it myself' writes Smith. 'The snag has been that we have not had a theory of development to incorporate. I think that situation is changing' (1995: 30). If there is indeed feedback from human sociality to evolution it can only be traced through ontogeny (Dobzhansky &amp; Boesiger 1983: 101). What seems unquestionable is that bio-social collaboration will make little further progress until a clearer perception of human development is achieved. The disciplinary dogmatism of which I complained at the outset is surely at odds with the professional interest anthropologists have established in the inter- pretation of other intellectual systems, one aim of which has been to put our own ideologies into context. Anthropologists have never been comfortable about heterodoxy It threatens our own theoretical constructs and it disrupts our images of cultural integrity, our tacit desire for a consensus, among the people we study, concerning the issues which we ourselves find interesting. But the irony is that knowledge is always a product of divergent understandings, be- cause ultimately the mysteries of life must be discovered and perpetuated by each one of us as we grow. We may look with envy on the apparent ease with which folk cosmologies reconcile the distinctions between nature and society which so perplex us; but this is not because their understandings are simpler and less flexible ('more traditional') than ours. More probably, it is because in smaller scale, non-literate, non-industrial societies there are fewer inhibitions on the creative dynamism of meaning.</page><page sequence="14">604 A.F. ROBERTSON NOTES My thanks to Francesca Bray, Donald E. Brown, Ramon Guardons and Tim Ingold for their comments on drafts of this article. 1 See especially Bloch 1991; Carrithers 1990; Goldschmidt 1993; Hinde 1991; Hirschfeld 1988; Ingold 1990; Toren 1993a. 2 See for example Morell 1993. 3 See Scheffler (1991: 373-5). According to Tooby &amp; Cosmides (1992: 92), 'Like fish un- aware of the existence of water, interpretativists swim from culture to culture interpreting through universal metaculture. Metaculture informs their every thought, but they have not yet noticed its existence'. 4 For all the dogmatic posturing, the cues for rapprochement are never very far from the surface. Consider, for example, the pregnant parenthesis in Wilson and Lumsden's hard-hitting defence of reductionism: culture is the outcome of 'mechanism-based (and meaning-responsive) causation' (1991: 403). Nor is it entirely clear in whose arena the rapprochement will be con- structed: for the social anthropologist Ingold it will be in a reformed biology; and - more sur- prisingly - for the biologist Wilson it will be within a reformed social science. Compare: 'I want to propose that anthropology - including what passes as "social" or "cultural" in orienta- tion - falls entirely within the domain of biology' (Ingold 1990: 208). And: 'Biology is the key to human nature, and social scientists cannot afford to ignore its rapidly tightening principles. But the social sciences are potentially far richer in content. Eventually they will absorb the rele- vant ideas of biology and go on to beggar them' (Wilson 1978: 13). 5 See the various approaches to bio-cultural 'coevolution' proposed by Boyd &amp; Richerson (1986); Chagnon &amp; Irons (1979); Durham (1978); Lopreato (1984); Lumsden &amp; Gushurst (1991); and see critical comments by Ingold (1990: 220; 1991a: 241). See also the bio-cultural 'interactionism' sketched by Lewontin et al. (1984: 266, 282). 6 Darwinian bio-social studies have been beset by the fundamental difficulties of applying a retrospective theory of adaptive traits at the species level to the interpretation of motive, inten- tion, choice, risk, etc., at the level of the individual organism. For example, Daly and Wilson (1988) assure us that 'Adaptation is not prospective. The apparent purpose in organismic design depends upon the persistence of essential features of historical environments'. In explaining homicide, they declare that their intention 'is to use Darwin's discovery that the properties of organisms have been shaped by a history of selection as an heuristic for the generation of mod- els and hypotheses about the sorts of psychological mechanisms that an animal like Homo sapi- ens might be expected to have evolved. We then use these psychological models and hypotheses to predict and explain patterned variation in the risk of interpersonal conflict and homicide'. The problems of temporal logic are revealed here in verb-tense structure ('might be expected to have evolved') and in the analytical use of such contradictory notions as 'expected fitness' (1988: 7, 6, 10). 7 B. Williams remarks on 'the naive assumption of certain sociobiologists that sociobiology should expect to be more closely related to social anthropology than to other social sciences, because the 'primitive' people studied by social anthropology are nearer to nature than human beings who live in large industrialized societies' (1995: 102). 8 See Rees &amp; Harvey (1991); and the caveats of Boyer (1994: 28) and Symons (1992). 9 In the domain of economics, for example, 'fitness' captivated both Marx and Marshall and continues to enthral a whole sub-species of 'evolutionary economists'. For reviews of this lit- erature see Hodgson 1993 and Nelson 1995; for a critical comment see R. Williams (1973: 122-3). 10 See Goldschmidt (1993: 354); Sperber (1985); Tooby &amp; Cosmides (1992: 24); and Boyer - especially his ideas of recurrence (1994: ix, 12, 279). 11 In recent years, historians have made great progress towards placing the life course of indi- viduals in the context of historical events, mainly through the analysis of age cohorts. The ex- tension of this approach to the organization of reproduction should prove very illuminating. See especially Elder 1985; Hareven 1982; 1986; Mannheim 1952; Rossi 1985; and see Spencer (1990: 19-22). 12 In proposing an ontogenetic framework for dissolving the nature-nurture dichotomy, and for mitigating genetic determinism, Oyama (1985) admits the contrariness of her enterprise.</page><page sequence="15">A.F. ROBERTSON 605 13 As Keller points out, 'To the extent that the advent of sex undermines the reproductive autonomy of the individual organism, it simultaneously undermines the possibility of locating the causal efficacy of evolutionary change in individual properties' (1987: 395). 14 See Carucci 1985: 109; Foner 1984; Rossi 1987; 1993: 193, 208. For example in New Brit- ain, 'The years that a person spends as a young spouse and parent are the years of peak sexual activity, and it is during this time that the behavioral dimorphism of the sexes is most extreme'. Thereafter, 'rigid gender roles' are relaxed: 'As parenting responsibilities decline vith old age, so also do the behavioral markers of gender until, in old age, even those most strongly en- trenched may disappear': old men sweep and babysit, old women may be 'tolerated' at other- wise exclusively male ceremonies (Counts &amp; Counts 1985: 135, 149). 15 Our own understandings of 'a life' seem exceptionally narrow, confined as they are within the clinical boundaries of birth and death (see Korein 1978). Human development is more usu- ally, and perhaps more instructively, seen as merging the lives of those who are both 'dead' and yet to be 'born' (see for example Geertz &amp; Geertz 1975; LaFleur 1992). In such a rubric it is less startling to think of an individual, in sleep or illness, moving back and forth across the corporeal margins of life, or even for a funeral to be conducted for someone we would not think of as 'dead' (Counts &amp; Counts 1985: 151, 145). If we view a person's life as physically integral and temporally linear, other people are more likely to see it as an accumulation and dispersal of relationships, a process which means more than the growth and decay of the body itself 16 For a biological discussion of senescence see especially Comfort 1979 and Stini 1991. Bio- social understanding of the later stages of human development has been constrained by experi- mental methods which explore the physiology of aging in the conveniently short lives of small laboratory animals (see Spear &amp; Campbell 1979). 17 Note the importance of distinguishing potential lifespan, which has probably remained fairly constant at around one hundred years since the palaeolithic period, and the average or normal lifespan, which Comfort (1966: 130) estimates thus: Neanderthal man: 29.4 years Upper palaeolithic: 32.4 Classical Rome: 32 England 1250: 38 USA 1900: 61.5 USA 1950: 70 Longevity is the tendency of the lifespan to approximate the potential, and life expectancy is a demographic and actuarial estimate of normal lifespan at birth or some other stage in the life process. For example, the current estimate of life expectancy at birth in Japan is 78 (World Bank 1994). 18 See for example Bengtson &amp; Achenbaum 1993; Binstock &amp; George 1990; Guillemard 1983; Johnson et al. 1989; Orloff 1993; Schulz 1985; Tassel &amp; Stearns 1986; Wise 1990. 19 See Oyama 1985: 154-64; Ingold 1990: 213; and, for example, the glossary in Wilson (1978: 220). 20 Ingold describes this as 'Weismann's barrier', essentially the separation of germ plasm 'which contains all the instructions necessary to assemble the organism' and its product the somatoplasm, which 'has direct contact with the environment'. In this refinement of the Darwin- ian paradigm, the direction of causality means 'The inheritance of characteristics acquired by an organism during its own life-history, through the impact of environmental experience, is there- fore a logical impossibility'. Ingold proposes a reversal of this order of reasoning: 'both organ- ism and environment emerge from a continuous process of development. Moreover, the inter- face between them is not one of external contact between separate and mutually exclusive do- mains, for enfolded within the organism itself is the entire history of its environmental rela- tions' (1990: 212, 216). 21 Developmental psychologists, however, have recently paid increasing attention to the later stages of the human life cycle: see Erikson 1980: 1985; Lerner 1984: 22-32; Lerner &amp; Hultsch 1983). 22 Tooby and Cosmides recognize, but do not elaborate upon, the ontogenetic implications of their argument concerning 'psychological architecture': 'Not all features of evolved human de- sign are or can be present at any one time in any one individual. Thus the genetically universal</page><page sequence="16">606 A.F. ROBERTSON may be developmentally expressed as different maturational designs in the infant, the child, the adolescent, and the adult; in females and males; or in individuals who encounter different cir- cumstances' (Tooby &amp; Cosmides 1992: 82). 23 We must be quite clear about this: in cultural studies, 'reproduction' is used in metaphori- cal and, I believe, persistently misleading senses (see Robertson 1991: 155-6). 24 My approach to these issues has been very much influenced by the work of Fortes and his associates on the 'developmental cycle in domestic groups' (see especially Bloch 1973; Fortes 1949; 1969; Goody 1958). However, my interests differ in that I have been more concerned than Fortes with the historical (rather than substantive) meanings of reproduction, and more interested in its biological bases than, for example, Goody. 25 I have for example explored the distinction between wage and salary in these terms (Robertson 1991: 129-40). 26 Toren rejects conventional views of the child as a-social and a-historical receptacle for adult meanings: 'The child is taken to be biologically an a-social individual who becomes social/cultural by virtue of actions performed upon it by others. Thus the child is made the locus of a split between "individual" and "society", between "biology" and "culture", and proc- essual relations with others are reified as "structures" that are outside and beyond the particular persons who are cognitively constituting them as such' (Toren 1993a: 469). 27 It is interesting to reflect that institutions, such as the household, which bring persons at different stages of development into the most intimate conjunction, are likely to contain the most ontogenetically differentiated understandings of life. Houses are objectively perceptible, material structures: substantially and coherently 'there' with - it would seem - one shape and a single story to tell. The paterfamilias, with all his authority, may tell that story, but enveloping as they do the relentless life processes of human beings, the meanings houses contain are multi- valent. A wall, a room, the location of a piece of furniture, is freighted with quite different significances and sentiments for a girl or boy, a child or adult, a grandparent or grandchild; and - the force of the developmental argument - for a child as he or she turns into an adult. 28 The hyperbole is ever-present. In Lerner and Hultsch (1983: 462) the caption to a very posed-looking picture of a group of West African women and children clustered round an older man reads: 'How and what we remember depends on the cultural context. In a culture such as the one shown here, the storyteller could retain a complete tribal history'. 29 Context is obviously salient: long-term experience of ecological patterns is valuable in agrarian societies, but the wisdom of age may count for less in the fast-moving technologies of our late-modern societies where technical history, it often seems, has outpaced the life process. 30 Jahoda (1993: 284-5) cites an unpublished study by Wassman and Dasen, who discovered that while hot-cool-cold categories were very important among the Yupno of Papua New Guinea, it was 'notably old men and especially ritual specialists' who used these categories to sort objects; 'others, such as younger men and women were usually aware of the categories but did not use them in the sorting task'. Jahoda concludes that 'the hot-cold dichotomy of objects is prevalent as a collective representation widespread in the [Yupno] culture, but plays little part in everyday life' (1993: 285). This does not seem quite correct: it is not that any Yupno may insist on the categorization some of the time, but that some Yupno - older men - are more likely to insist on the categorization than others. 31 See Nahemow 1979; Robertson 1978; and Robertson &amp; Hughes 1978. The historical 'win- dow' here is 1965-1975. 32 In arguing against metaphoric applications of the evolutionary paradigm I would agree with B. Williams (1995: 91) that the ontogeny-phylogeny relationship has little relevance as an analogy for explanation in the study of culture or knowledge. 33 See for example Bourdieu 1977; Gallagher &amp; Laqueur 1987; Samuel 1990; Turner 1995. 34 See especially Oyama's discussion of ontogeny (1985) and Gould's reappraisal of the ontogeny-phylogeny debate (1977).

Developpement de la signification: ontogenese et culture Resume Pour faire avancer les etudes bio-culturelles, il faut trouver un moyen d'inserer, entre les modes temporels rivaux de 1' evolution et de l'histoire, la capacite d'agir qui se trouve au centre de 1'existence humaine. Cet article part de la notion biologique (trop longtemps negligee) d'ontogenese, pour l'etendre a la socialite, une dimension absolument essentielle de notre vie en tant qu'espece. Pour etre viable, un modele du developpement humain se doit de considerer le cycle de vie dans toute son entierete, y compris le processus de vieillissement. Le cycle de vie doit etre compris dans le contexte des relations sociales de reproduction, et non pas comme une notion reduite a la dimension individuelle. L'unite bio-culturelle, loin d'etre un individu statique, modal, psychiquement integre, sexuellement</page><page sequence="20">610 A.F. ROBERTSON indifferencie, et egocentre, est un processus a travers lequel les personnes se forment et se dissolvent, vont de l'impotence dependante a F'autorite independante, se divisent et se multiplient au travers des relations qu'elles etablissent avec les autres, et acquierent une connaissance plus ou moins developpee du monde, pour finalement posseder et perdre la capacite de le changer. L'unite bio-culturelle represente donc le milieu au sein duquel les significations, materiau composant la culture, sont formees, perpetuees et transformees.
