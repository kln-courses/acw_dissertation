Father Festugiere is a scholar and historian of religion who has written both on general religious topics and on particular problems of ancient religious thought. That he should have found epicurean theology a sufficiently in- teresting subject seems, at first sight, strange. For of the two main Hellenistic philosophies it is the stoic that presents the more positive and idealistic, the epicurean the more negative and materialistic attitude to religion. But, Festugibre says, he has found the epicurean attitude more deserving of re-examination because of its greater com- plexity, because it 'comporte plus de nuances.' The result is not merely an exhibition of a scholar's sensitivity to these finer shades of complexity. His instinct has led him to reveal and state a conclusion which is important and convincing. Epicurus was not indifferent to religion or a sceptic: he was, on the contrary, as Bignone perceived, one of those who reacted against the growing unbelief of the age. The foundation of his thought is his ideal of human happiness as freedom from care, &amp;rapa?ia: and this ideal is to be explained in relation to the political and social insecurity of the time. Turning to the gods, Epicurus could only describe their happiness in terms of his human ideal: and it is with piety, as well as with an unconscious anthropomorphism, that he describes their care-free state, and inveighs against the attribution to them of qualities which he regarded as unworthy. It was to exalt, not to denigrate, their character that he declares that they do not take account of mortals. 'Des dieux qui ne feraient pas de mal. Des dieux qui ne seraient pas mechants. Des dieux qui ne seraient pas tout le temps a surveiller vos moindres gestes pour voir si vous n'outrepassez pas la mesure . . . ni a epier vos moindres faux-pas pour vous abattre, siirs d'ailleurs qu'un jour vous tomberez entre leurs mains et qu'ils pourront assouvir leur vengeance. Des dieux enfin sans haine et sans envie. Voila la bonne nouvelle qu' Epicure apportait au monde.. On Festugiere's interpretation Epicurus falls into line with the great religious reformers of Greece-Xenophanes, Parmenides and Plato-who tried to reform and elevate the notion of God. It has taken a Catholic historian to make Epicurus a Protestant. Festugiere's first chapter deals with the state of religious thought and feeling in the age of Alexander and his suc- cessors, and his second chapter with the life of Epicurus. Both are valuable summaries. In Chapter III (L'amitie epicurienne) he does not link epicurean comradeship sufficiently closely with the idea of 9thia, as a political conception, in earlier thought. The happiness, at which Epicurus aimed, had been the aim of political theory, while the city was the sole and sufficient form of social organisa- tion. In Plato and the sophists aIc6ws and 8iKTr are the bonds of p~tia, 6p6vota and 81KxaIouCiv are closely allied ideas. In Epicurus ythia remains associated with the ideal of happiness, although the political connexion had been broken by events. In general Festugiere is not entirely free from the tendency to regard the Hellenistic Age as some- thing specifically different from the age of Plato and Aristotle. Chapter IV sets out the central argument of the book with regard to the epicurean religion. Chapter V treats of Epicurus' attitude towards the ' astral ' religion of Plato and Aristotle. The book is equipped with a useful biblio- graphy, and the text is adequately supported with foot- notes. J. S. MORRISON.</page></plain_text>
