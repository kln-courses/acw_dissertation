<plain_text><page sequence="1">IDEOLOGY AND INSCRIPTION: CULTURAL STUDIES AFTER BENJAMIN, DE MAN, AND BAKHTIN. By Tom Cohen. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. 258 p. Tom Cohen's Ideology and Inscription: Cultural Studies After Benjamin, de Man, and Bakhtin is an untimely book in the best sense of the word. Following his Anti-Mimesis From Plato to Hitchcock (1994)-part of the same Literature, Culture, Theory series from Cambridge University Press and continuing many of the same themes-and recently followed by a new collection of essays from Minnesota (Material Events: Paul de Man and the Afterlife of Theory, 2001), Ideology and Inscription is part of an ongoing attempt to make a much-needed inter- vention in current U.S. academic trends. It is untimely in part because it interrogates a form of Cultural Studies that relies on what Cohen calls an "archivism of the present" (p. 102), which it does by calling up specters of criticism's past as a means of conceiving a new kind of cultural study that would not base itself on their presumed death. Cohen's turn to theory--above all to the figure of Paul de Man (well interred by contemporary criticism), as well as his readings of Bakhtin and Benjamin against the Cultural Studies grain-forms the basis of an important critique of the current critical movement, which, in spite of the number of books dedicated to archiving its place in the present, has not been sufficiently theorized. The positioning of his argument beyond the Theory vs. Cul- tural Studies divide, which has proved paralytic for both sides in recent years, promises to be one of the book's most influential contributions. Readers should be warned that Cohen's</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS/79 style takes some getting used to, but the brilliance of his observations and their (un) timeli- ness at the end of the "Cultural Studies decade" mark Ideology and Inscription as one of the most important, if as yet underacknowledged, critical achievements of the day. Although he spends relatively little time tracing out a genealogy of recent criticism, Cohen's diagnosis of the last few decades is incisive, and invaluable for an evaluation of contemporary criticism. In the 1980s, "theory," which he defines as "a philosophically inflected amalgam of programs interfacing linguistic concerns with the redefinition of 'history' (or, for that matter, human agency, meaning, impositions of power, and so on) ' fell short of its projects when it began to indulge in a "fetishization of language or the text" (p. 5). This development was followed by a turn to a conception of history and politics that was based on the rejection of theory's interest in language, and the adop- tion, by and large, of a transparent and linear understanding of history as well as a return to subjectivities, bodies, and models of "lived life" Such a conception of politics and his- tory, however, falls prey to what Cohen terms a "mimetic blind" (p. 51): a blind faith in the promises of descriptive rhetoric or mimetic representation, as well as a historicist understanding of history that believes that historical events can be apprehended like beads on a rosary, to use Benjamin's simile. Against such an approach, Cohen proposes a new kind of cultural study that would concentrate on epistemo-political concerns, such as those developed by Benjamin and de Man in his later writings. Rather than a concept of history centered on interiorized and mimetically conceived models of the subject and community, Cohen proposes, following such critics as de Man, Benjamin, and Adorno, to refocus the understanding of history on a concept of "mate- riality" that can not be empirically apprehended or mimetically represented, and that always lies in excess of all models of interiority. Historicist and mimetic representations that do not relinquish their claim to the concept of identity-even those that attempt to represent "alternate" histories or forms of identity-are not only blind to this materiality, but also border on a dangerous form of conservatism that would block out the possibili- ties that a non-interiorist history represents. De Man considered mimetic representation to be a form of ideology, one that is focused on anthropomorphism and meaning at the expense of a historical materiality that exceeds both. Cohen reminds us that, even under persecution from fascism, Benjamin identified "the enemy" as not the fascists themselves, but a form of historicism that presumes to contain or comprehend its object. Both de Man and Benjamin considered language to be intrinsically related to historicity and materiality, especially inasmuch as it represents the possibility of intervening-or "in- scribing" a different kind of history-into mimetic-historicist structures. The idea of an interventionist possibility of inscription forms the heart of Cohen's book, and he develops it in terms of a figure common to both Benjamin and de Man, that of allegory. Cohen's take on allegory, which he renames "allography" (p. 7), is particularly refreshing given the mishmash of interpretations this trope has generated: he considers it a "techne of historial intervention" whereby language's material nature would represent a cut or incision into naturalized representational models of history and identity, open- ing them up to a radical alterity, "a site precedent to any distribution of representational force and sedimentation-any regimen of identification and anthropomorphism pre- sented as current facticity" (pp. 8, 109). Far from implying a fetishistic relationship with language or the text, this interpretation would be the basis for what Cohen, following Benjamin, calls a "materialist historiography"(p. 105), a kind of history writing that does not foreclose the alterity of history itself, but opens up representation to sites of its emer- gence. Such an inscription, or other-writing ("allography"), would loosen the claims of historicist models and introduce the possibility of conceiving a different relationship with the past, the historical event, and consequently with the future.</page><page sequence="3">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /80 In considering the question of ideology, Cohen turns to two of the more prominent figures currently associated with the anachronistic "resurrection" of the term, Slavoj Zizek and Ernesto Laclau. Cohen's attempt to read Zizek's theory of ideology as a "generative matrix" in terms of Derrida's idea of the matrix or "Khora" (p. 17) is, I believe, a bit misled, and Cohen himself ends by distancing himself from Zizek due to his refusal to acknowledge language's potential for intervening in the ideological and his trust in more immediate forms of intervention (pp. 147, 154-55). Cohen's use of Laclau is interesting, although perhaps not sufficiently worked out. He relies exclusively on Laclau's 1997 essay "The Death and Resurrection of the Theory of Ideology," in which Laclau describes the idea of a "constitutive distortion'" a "contradictio in adjecto," at the center of any ideologi- cal representation, which is disavowed in a projection of social fullness (qtd. in Cohen p. 18). Cohen hopes to designate this "constitutive distortion" as the space of possibility for an inscription or intervention into the ideological. Access to a different order of "temporality, representation, the 'event,' [or] the human itself" (Cohen p. 19) is possible not from an extra-ideological site (as Laclau makes it clear there is no outside to ideol- ogy), but from within a gap or failure internal to ideology, a rupture or excess from within the ideological operation itself. In certain circles such a rupture is called "sub- alternity," an alterity that is internal to the social but exceeds its self-representations.' Yet Laclau denies the possibility of any intervention or transformation at the site of the fail- ure of the social. For him, such a site represents only the inherent instability of the hege- monic components of society, which at every moment are ready to fold in on themselves but which, through recuperative strategies, manage to save themselves in their precari- ousness ("Death and Resurrection" 321). In another essay, he specifically denies the pos- sibility of any transformative power from the non-site of subalternity, the "constitutive distortion" of any hegemonic group, suggesting that any change to the social will only come from hegemonic factions-that is, from the ideological construction of social identity that denies the constitutive distortion at its base ("Subalternity" 8-9). Cohen's work provides the possibility of a powerful critique of such a conception, but unfortu- nately he does not follow through with it. He also diverges from Laclau on the question of history itself. Laclau explains the construction of ideology with the trope of a chain, whereby heterogeneity is incorporated into social identity as links on an equivalential chain, which can be indefinitely expanded ("Death and Resurrection" 304-05). Such a spatial metaphor, I would argue, all but negates history, leaving no room for any sort of historical-material inscription that would not immediately be incorporated into the ever-expanding chain. One of the most important tropes Cohen invokes is that of "earth,' the world, or the "allohuman'.' These figures appear in a number of theories that Cohen considers throughout the course of the book, including the earthy side of de Man's "materiality" (p. 53), Benjamin's concept of a "natural history" (pp. 124-25), Nietzsche's figure of "earth" (p. 117), and different conceptions of nature, science, eco-politics, and the na- ture of life or the zoological. He describes the rupture with "the self-referential system of mimeto-humanism" that these ideas propose: "a 'materiality' that is neither mimetic (ref- erence) nor dialectical (Marxian 'base'), which traverses faux binaries such as organic and inorganic, human and animal, life and death" (p. 53). Against diverse attempts by 1 For an excellent discussion of subalternity, especially in relation to Zizek's and Laclau's recent work, see Alberto Moreiras, "A Thinking Relationship: The End of Subalternity. Notes on Hegemony, Contingency, Universality. Contemporary Dialogues on the Left" (forthcoming in South Atlantic Quarterly). Moreiras describes subalternity thus: "Subalternity is not merely the place of exclusion in any game of inclusion/exclusion. It is, rather, in its more extreme strength or weakness, the condition of possibility for the originary place of any exclusion/inclusion. Subalternity is the passible remainder of all polit- ical articulations" (7-8).</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS/81 contemporary critical trends to determine global or particular identities-who "we" are, who and/or what "the other" is-the outward frame of which might be represented in the familiar iconic image of the earth, conceptually mapped by any number of global systems and theories of globalization, Cohen returns us to the most elementary of theory's lessons: namely, that it is not possible to know who or what "we" are. Nietzsche is of course a key figure here, and his concept of the Ubermensch, the "Out-Man" or "allo-human' provides a model for thinking about the question of the human-and even of life or the world-outside of a rhetoric of interiority, as a kind of other-life in which "we" are never more than tourists (pp. 206-07) 2 Such tourism or travel (which includes as its most ex- emplary forms reading, writing, and memory [p. 205]) must not imitate the kind of eco-tourism that never leaves its own home (oikos), protected from bug-bites and com- munication difficulties, but should involve precisely a process of submersion in the for- eignness of all homes. This brings us to the final section of the book, which deals with "echo-tourism" as a way of marking the non-immediacy of the travel experience. He is, again, not using the term to refer to travel per se but to different types of crossings, whether mnemonic (he em- phasizes the exteriority of memory, as opposed to the idea that memory is something we can possess, p. 208), linguistic, or "cultural." In this final section he comes closest to demonstrating what he means by a new kind of Cultural Studies, one that would not submit to a humanist, historicist, and mimetic regimen of representation, but would open all such models in the name (a Benjaminian overtone of redemption very much implied)3 of materiality and the allohuman. He returns to the idea that even out in the world, on the outskirts of the "unnamed Empire" (p. 239)-for example, science and cyberspace, the outskirts of Europe and Latin America-when we think we are dealing with "the world;' we are often still very much bound to interiorist and self-centered narratives. His most interesting experiment in this section is the final chapter, "Contretemps: notes on contemporary 'travel,"' in which he develops the trope of travel as a kind of materialist and historical reading. In this chapter he describes, very anecdotally (taking the attempt to write a new kind of cultural study to a nearly parodic level), a trip he took to the Andes in 1996, following the death of his mother. The chapter describes a delicate project, leaving him open to charges of romanticizing the "Third World," but his inten- tions are far from that; rather, they are understandably focused on questions of life and death, humanness and the earth. Bolivia is, as Benjamin says of the outskirts of cities, a "state of emergency" within the nameless Empire of modernity (p. 229). Both the consti- tutive distortions of hegemonic order and the brutality of such order are particularly visible-although we cannot presume the immediate "readability" of the catastrophe, as he points out (p. 239)-in places such as Potosi, Bolivia, where the impossibility of the social, or of the Empire itself, is represented in the form of an eroded mountain tra- versed by the splintered narratives of commercial neo-coloniality, a long and violent colo- 2 "Out-Man" is Werner Hamacher's translation of Nietzsche's Ubermensch. Cohen's reading of the relationship between Benjamin and Nietzsche emerges as an important subtext in different parts of the book, and provides a significant challenge to Beatrice Hanssen's reading of that relationship in her remarkable book Walter Benjamin's Other History: Of Stones. Animals Human Beings, and Angels, 1998 (see Cohen pp. 111-12, 117-23, and pp. 205-07). Cohen reads Benjamin in a refreshingly a-theological light, representing in this sense an impor- tant counterpoint to Hanssen's book (see above). He prefers a "technological" to a theological read- ing of Benjamin's redemptive politics, one that linguistically intervenes in the allohuman and mate- rial realm of history (see especially pp. 7-9 and 13-16). 4 His understanding of travel in this sense is to be distinguished from something like Edward Said's idea of "traveling theory," as well as from the enthusiasm for the travel writing genre that has hit the academic market in the past decade (see pp. 238-39).</page><page sequence="5">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /82 nial past, and traces of human (or allohuman) survival in the midst of some of the most brutal working conditions that still exist in the world. Such sites require not an anthropo- logical reading, based on pathos and the strength of individual subjects to overcome an oppressive existence, but a historical and material one, in which the dominant narratives of production and survival reveal "cracks and caesuras"-alternative temporalities, forms of life, human existence, and the earth itself-that do not conform to the histories de- signed for them. Cohen calls this, in contrast to anthro- or cultural biocentrism, a "zoographics" (p. 246), which can of course be found as much in New York city as on the Andean altiplano and involves different kinds of inscriptions and paths traced by the "ant-swarm" of humanity and by nature itself. "Bios" is something that can be controlled and contained: it describes the bodies in Laclau's equivalential chain that at once deform and incarnate an abstract ideal-of the social, of the human, of particular historical narratives. "Zoe,' on the other hand, describes a conception of life that exceeds or does not incarnate hegemonic identity. In this sense, it is like the subaltern, but it would be a subalternity that included or involved all life, not just an identifiable subset of hegemonic (and hu- man) constructions. How to read this subaltern graphics is another question. Cohen provides only anecdotal hints in the concluding chapter, but he insists that it is a task compelled by the "spur ofjustice" (p. 241). As Cohen is well aware, any quest for the limits of life and death in a culture other than one's own leaves itself open to be read as a kind of orientalism, a romanticization of the foreignness of other cultures, or a search for an other in order to place one's "self" (p. 239). The myth that historico-cultural knowledge about the place in question will reduce the romantic nature of the encounter with other cultures is easily broken down, because such knowledge promises a possession of the foreign, while the foreign (like the familiar) describes precisely that which can not be possessed or properly known. That said, I want to take issue with Cohen's concluding chapter on one important point. While this chap- ter is the one that most closely resembles already existing forms of Cultural Studies, it is also the one that comes closest to suggesting what a new non-humanistic Cultural Studies would look like. Although it is just a beginning, I think it works well as one, as does the project of the entire book: as an inscription into the histories of humanistic culture, which, particularly at certain "sites of urgency," stages the emergence of a whole different order of history and zoo-materialism. However, in this final chapter Cohen repeats a mistake that has been all too prevalent in humanistic versions of Cultural Studies, namely, the tendency to equate so-called peripheral cultures with the concrete, with bodies, and with a conception of the "real" that can be opposed to language and literature. Cohen's attention to the ant-swarm of humanity on the flanks of the Andes repeats this tendency too readily. It is the lack of attention to other kinds of inscriptions in this particular fold of the Empire that seems to me to be an error. It is as though (to out-neologize him) he were interested only in "Bio-livian" inscriptions, as though in Bolivia history were written only with the feet (a favorite trope of his) or in the mist of Mt. Illumani. I would suggest Leonardo Garcia-Pab6n's La patria intima (1998) as an introduction to a less intimate view of Bolivian historical inscriptions than that provided by Cohen's anecdotal account. More specifically, I would add Jaime Saenz's poetry, or the remarkable skull and bones sections of Bartolomb Arzans's "chronicle" of Potosi, or the "devils" and other such fig- ural constructions described by Michael Taussig in his book TheDevil and Commodity Fetish- ism, or even the indigenous moon symbols that are inserted like spears into the Catholic iconography of the colonial churches. In terms of feet, there are the frequent public protests that immobilize La Paz, effecting a kind of "inscription" that opens the city to different pasts and futures.</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS/83 Cohen ends his book with the figure of a "pan-zoographics,' a historical inscription of life in the materiality of the earth, which, as he makes clear throughout the book (with the exception of the last chapter), includes language as an integral component. Life, materiality, and history are not immediately apprehensible, and any attempt to reduce them to a single mimetic representation is ideological in the extreme, subjecting them to an existence that can be described as a living death, a "life" (bios) that refuses death and therefore "life" (zoe) itself. This is what Cohen says of contemporary Cultural Studies, that it is a critical program that refuses death, including above all the "dead letter" of language, but also pasts that are not embodied in mimetic and historicist representa- tions, as well as different orders of the present and future (p. 103). While I share his opinion about this, I do not share his prediction that this version of Cultural Studies will itself be unable to die, strangely "spellbound" by its conception of immediate reality and the promise of mimetic representation. Indeed I think that, as Adorno suggested to Benjamin (not realizing that Benjamin himself was already well aware of this), "theory" can break the spell and return the study of culture back to a study of history whose rep- resentation is not an attempt to foreclose the historical itself (qtd. on p. 2). Cohen's book provides us with a critical step in this direction, if not all the material we need to break the spell ourselves. KATEJENCKES Reed College Works Cited Garcia-Pab6n, Leonardo.
