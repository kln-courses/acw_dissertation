<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paula Rego' s Nursery Rhymes Sanda Miller As a literary species, nursery rhymes are as singularly British as any of its national institutions but, equally, they belong - together with fairy tales or children's games - to a wider genus of lore which contributes to create our collective unconscious. The very nature of nursery rhymes requires that in order to preserve their appeal in book format, ideally they should be accompanied by illustrations. This established norm can be traced back to the earliest recorded printed edi- tions : for this reason it would take a formidable artist even to attempt to break the inherited formulae of such a link between images and text. Paula Rego has succeeded in this by endowing her illustrations with a universal appeal, without depriving them of an idiosyncratic character. Iconographically, each etching is a triumph of textual interpretation translated into its visual equivalent. Here they are, all our old friends, ready to comfort us with their reassuring familiarity. Or are they? The Three Blind Mice (fig. 36) have metamorphosized into larger-than-life rats, wriggling their revulsive bodies in a devilish chase after the young female who cut off their tails with a dagger more lethal than any 'carving knife'. The motif of mutilation/castration can be traced in Paula Rego's work as far back as 1981 when, after a period of searching during which she found and abandoned in turn Henry Miller, Dubuffet and collage,1 this seminal preoccupation emerged in paintings such as Red Monkey Beats his Wife , The Beari The Bear's Wife and Son Play with i .

There is a linguistic ambiguity here,3 between the words 'tail' and 'tale' : in this case a tale in which the act of mutilation of the monkey's tail and that of the monkey vomiting blood implies a double metaphor of castration. This ambiguity may have been suggested by a predecessor Paula Rego knows only too well : '. . . Mine is a long and sad tale !' said the Mouse, turning to Alice and sighing. 'It is a long tail, certainly', said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad ?'.4 The Untitled Girl and Dog series of 1 986 present variations on the same theme, but the brutality of the earlier animal drolleries is here replaced by a feeling of uncomfortable suspense in the recurring motif of the pubescent girl, lovingly tending a pet. But instead of tender nurturing, she seems about to inflict unspeakable acts upon the animal, 'castrated' into total passivity. Here 'the dividing line between nurturing and harming - between love and murder - is always hair- thin, for the artist's concern is not with good and evil at their extremes, but with the area between, the acts of cruelty with which love is shot'.5 The same theme is carried through in a more recent series of works painted in 1988-89, which include The Cadet and his Sister and Departure , with the difference that the drama is acted out by an all anthropomorphic cast, around a pubescent girl and boy. The theatrical analogy is not entirely fortuitous : as a child, Paula Rego played with a miniature Spanish theatre and a parallel between it and her playroom has been suggested.6 This became the stage on which she acted out the only play she knew - her everyday life, in which she was the protagonist. In The Soldier's Daughter or The Policeman's Daughter of 1987 a young girl is also the protagonist, plucking a goose or polishing a boot (fig. 38) : she is as solitary as Paula Rego was when drawing, surrounded by the silent witnesses of the play room - a statuette, a cat, a toy soldier. The natural next step was to use a play as a direct source of inspiration, and in The Maids of 1987, derived from Genet's play, the artist visualized the text in three dimensions, as a stage designer would : the painting could almost be turned into a doll's house, the basic tool of the stage designer. In the Nursery Rhymes (figs. 32-35) we witness a return to the mixed cast, which this time also involves a complete reversal of scale : the gambolling creature in Black Sheep1 is a scary black ram seated on a stool, and about to engulf a smaller girl in its embrace. According to the artist, how- ever, the reason for the ram's ' unheimliche ' appearance8 is due to a trivial incident : the print was left too long in the aquatint bath.9 It was precisely the incongruity of situations such as this that attracted Paula Rego when she undertook the pro- ject: 'I love the oddity and the unexpectedness of the Baa Baa Black Sheep - the whole thing of a sheep answering is wonderful . . . if you see the drawing he has quite a sweet expression on his face, the sheep; then he got so dark in the print; I thought, oh, my God! Doesn't he look like the Devil?'10 This element of oddity permeates Paula Rego' s entire œuvre. It goes back to her collage work of Ï959, but is especially prominent in the Operas and the Vivian Girls , the latter series inspired by a book written by the 'Outsider' artist Henry Darger, a book in which the divisions between human, animal and vegetable worlds are eliminated, creating havoc. The Nursery Rhymes was not Rego's first attempt at illustration: in 1974-75 she illustrated Portuguese folk tales with such works as Two Men Separated by a River of Blood and Girl Sitting on a Well With Heads in Foreground. The popular fable Branca Flor was among the tales.11 There is something archaic about these old songs and fables and proverbs and one thinks that they touch very deep and they touch something that is somewhat dan- gerous and to do with the power of children. I think that women are closer to children and we have more access to those areas which are tenebrous but thrilling. Folk tales interpret situations for you; here you are in this room and you got to turn straw into gold - what do you do? What you do is think of Rumpelstiltskin, right? That's been done before with the helping animal or the helping creature ; that's what the Vivian Girls also had - so : it is little idiot things which help idiot minds - a sort of refuge, but this is only one way of looking at things.12 The nocturnal scenes such as The Grand Old Duke of York or Hey, Diddle, Diddle! are outstanding, and How Many Miles to Babylon? is special to the artist because - as she 2.

We find more than a hint from his illustrations in the grinning cat playing the fiddle, and in Poly and Sukey with their quaint kettles and aprons - both of whom are too large for the doll's house in which they seem trapped, reminding us of Alice when she grows to giant size. Paula Rego's Humpty Dumpty (fig. 35), unlike his disdainful original perched on a wall, has already to contend with his 'great fall'. Carl Gustav Jung deplored the fact that 'the mythic side of man is given short shrift nowadays. He can no longer create fables. As a result, a great deal escapes him ; for it is important and salutary to speak also of incomprehen- sible things. Such talk is like the telling of a good ghost story, as we sit by the fireside and smoke a pipe',14 or, one might continue, as we draw as Paula Rego does : 'you use folk tales - children do and we do - we interpret the world through stories ; the Bible . . . this is it, stories, making sense of things - everybody makes in their own way sense of things, but if you have stories it helps'.13 13.
