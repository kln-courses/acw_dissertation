The high chief Sopola Kyomba, writes the Rev. P. Colle, obtained these royal emblems" (p. 58). This information, however, is specific to Sopola and should not be generalized to include all the eastern Luba chiefs. Colle states in a lapidary fashion that the Luba king deliv- ered to Sopola "two slaves, one of whom car- ried a shield and the other a spear" (1913:58); there is no proof that the spear was an anthro- pomorphically decorated artwork like those presented by Neyt in this book. Susan Vogel (1986:172-75) and Ezio Bassani (1990) have isolated approximately ten stylisti- cally homogenous works attributable to a sin- gle artist who has been baptized the "Warua Master," Warua being the term employed by yesteryear's explorers to designate the popula- tions west of lakes Tanganyika and Mweru. Neyt tries to improve upon this lack of preci- sion: "Even if hardly any works attributed to this anonymous master have been located, it seems to us unchallengeable that they should be geographically and historically placed with- in the context of the tremendous Luba expan- sion towards the east and north-east... [They] may be regarded as regalia dating back to the reign of Prince Sopola" (p. 84). He consequent- ly rebaptizes the "Warua Master" as the "Master of the court of Sopola." The name, 88 however, is not justifiable, because the two works by this sculptor that have been precisely located come from Kishiale (28'14'E, 8?2'S) and Mpweto, in the valley of the Upper Luvua, while Sopola's chiefdom lay 100 or 200 kilome- ters farther to the northwest (Colle 1913:36-39, 58-60; Reefe 1981:124-27). The other Luba chief on whom Neyt has based his assertion is Buki, who in the nine- teenth century forged a state in the northeast of the kingdom. Neyt writes that "apart from sacred fire, he assumed the other royal insignia, organizing his kingdom in such a way that he in turn granted royal emblems to his own vas- sals" (p. 229). Among these emblems, the author notably includes Buli-style caryatid stools, and in a less explicit fashion, bowl bear- ers from the same workshop (pp. 37, 95, 216). In this instance, Neyt's remarks are based on Verhulpen, who says that Buki gave "fire and chiefly insignias" to his subordinates. Verhul- pen makes a list of insignias conferred by Buki to a particular subchief: a kibango scepter, a dou- ble bell, a drum, a shell, hammer anvils, a mboko (described as a calabash containing white clay),2 and a dibuki, a small bag of white clay (1936:181-82,351-53). Verhulpen's list is interesting. There clearly existed mechanisms for the transfer of objects from the court toward the periphery of the kingdom-or from the districts of important chiefs to those of less important ones-but this african arts autumn 1996 type of transfer related essentially to nonsculp- tural objects. Coals from the royal fire, or some- times a lighter, a mboko calabash, constituted the most powerful of these symbols obtained from the capital (Peeraer 1934:21; Verhul- pen 1936:129; Theuws 1954:17-18; 1962:229; Womersley 1975:86; Reefe 1981:126-27). Thus, this circulation of political symbols does not seem to have applied to statuary to any great extent. Theuws mentions that the white clay calabash received from the capital should have been placed in the receptacle of a bowl bearer, but the initiative for the sculpt- ing of these statues came from the local chief (Theuws 1954:17-18; 1962:230). Similarly, one of the Buli chiefs obtained from the Luba king the insignias of sacred authority: "the mboko gourd filled with white clay, the traditional luviyo lighter..., and lastly, the right to legiti- mately possess the kihona throne" (Gossiaux 1990:45): the transfer is not of the throne itself but of the right to a throne. In Kinkondja, in the past, a subchief received a scepter from an emissary of the Luba king, but every time it was lost or "disactivated," a local artist took on the task of sculpting a new one; the re- placement remained worthless until it was magically activated in the capital (Nooter 1991:165-67; Roberts &amp; Roberts 1996:164-68). These data help to specify the nature of regalia and the context in which it was spread. They show that the movement generally per- tained to objects of no artistic interest; the periphery maintained the initiative for the sculpting, strictly speaking, of objects associated with power, even if they were activated by the incorporation of substances from the capital. On the whole, the author associates regalia and anthropomorphic statuary too closely. His interest in figurative objects alone sometimes leads him to misinterpret his sources. Thus, according to Neyt (p. 100), Burton described the use of a "caryatid stool" during enthronement; but actually he simply mentioned a "stool" and an "upturned stamp-block" (Burton 1961:23; see Neyt, p. 107, and Womersley 1984:71 for another example). According to the old digni- tary Kyoni Kumwimba (personal communica- tion: Kabongo, March 10, 1991), the real throne of the Kabongo Luba king is not a caryatid stool but a stool composed of a dome-shaped base and summit connected by four posts. This piece of information supports certain conclusions drawn by Mary Nooter Roberts, who empha- sizes the importance of nonfigurative objects among the symbols of authority (Nooter 1991:138-40). Based on a scanty knowledge of Luba eth- nography, Neyt's book creates confusion be- tween the two main Luba ritualists, the kilumbu mediums, who divine by spirit possession, and the members of the mbudye secret society, who enhance the principal events of the community with their dances and play a major role in the conservation and spread of the kingdom's epic and esoteric traditions. Neyt wrongly assigns to the mbudye the talents of "prophets," of "seers" or "messengers and interpreters be- tween the royal genies and spirits and the peo- ple" (p. 17-21), talents which are proper to the kilumbu mediums.3</page></plain_text>
