<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology in Asia Minor MACHTELD J. MELLINK PLATES 23-28 The progress report submitted here for the year 1959 shows that the number of excavations and dis- coveries is increasing steadily. All of the important sites discussed in the previous installment (AJA 64 [1960] 57-69) are still in operation, although study campaigns occasionally interrupt the active field work. There are important additions, some the result of systematic exploration, others, ironically among the most rewarding, the product of accidental discovery. For the earliest periods, the systematic research in the Lycian caves (see Beldibi and cf. earlier reports on Karain) begins to build up a reliable local Anatolian sequence from Palaeolithic to Neo- lithic. The work in the region of Antioch (cf. Magracik) confirms that previous and present blanks in our knowledge of the Anatolian Stone Age are due to the lack of exploration, not to an absence of early inhabitants. The first methodical investigation of Bronze Age shipping along the Anatolian coast is in progress at the time of the writing of this report. The Bronze Age wreck off the Lycian coast near Finike (cf. AJA 64 [196o] 58 and P. Throckmorton in Na- tional Geographic Magazine 117 [May 1960] 682- 703) has now become the object of an international archaeological diving expedition under joint Anglo- American sponsorship. The results vindicate the unusual effort: much of the metal cargo is being retrieved, and parts of the ship have been salvaged. The Bronze Age trade in the Eastern Mediter- ranean thus can be studied from a new and, for a pleasant change, non-ceramic angle. The third reward for the systematic archaeologi- cal approach fell to the excavators of Altlntepe near Erzincan. This site, slightly plundered before, now has amply repaid serious excavation with the dis- covery of intact burials of the late eighth century B.c. The inventory is stylistically related to material from Van and Karmir Blur; the date is furnished by the presence of Urartaean royal names on some of the bronzes. The discoveries point the way to further research both in the site of Altmntepe (necropolis and citadel) and in the intermediate areas between Urartu and Phrygia, powerful and prosperous centers of the later eighth century B.c. Of accidental discoveries followed by painstaking excavation the tumulus at Dardanos provides a brilliant example. The rich inventory of the built burial chamber will aid the students of stratified but fragmentary material from Hellenistic sites. The work at 9andarhll-Pitane was inspired by the discovery of an archaic statue at the site of the necropolis. Previous excavations at Pitane had been erratic and ill-recorded. The present expedition will apply modern standards of archaeological and his- torical analysis to this Aeolic site. The most unusual accidental discovery is the story of the treasures from Dorak. The account below will suggest how important, potentially, but how frustrating the present state of the Dorak affair is. The following reports are due to the unfailing kindness of Anatolian excavators and authorities. Special thanks are due to Professor Ekrem Akurgal, Professor U.

Senyiirek expanded his work in the Hatay district. He made another sound- ing in the Plugged Cave near Ma'racik and found a single Palaeolithic stratum with many flint tools of Levalloiso-Mousterian types, also fossilized mam- mal bones. The cave was especially used for habita- tion in the Palaeolithic period.</page><page sequence="2">38 MACHTELD J.

These finds occur in a gravel layer which is one meter thick (TTKR 1959, 15-16). BELDIBI. Dr. Enver Bostanci of the University of Ankara investigated various caves and rock shelters in the region between Antalya and Marmaris. His main objective was a rock shelter near Beldibi, a village on the east coast of Lycia about 30 miles southwest of Antalya. This rock shelter, ca. ioo meters from the sea, has a stratified sequence as follows: A, classical pottery with some primitive admixture; B, very primitive (neolithic) pottery, flint microliths, the pottery disappearing in the lower strata; CI, flint implements of Mesolithic type (Natufian, Capsian and Tardenoisian); C2, microlithic tools, flint implements of Lower Natu- fian type, painted pebbles (the first to be found in Anatolia), bone tools; D, larger tools, Upper Palaeolithic, E-F, Upper-Middle Palaeolithic. There are also primitive rock paintings (simple crosses, schematized figures) and rock engravings (deer) in this shelter. They may be Mesolithic and Palaeolithic, respectively, but further investigations are needed. Dr. Bostanci also noticed two other sites with rock paintings in the vicinity of Beldibi (Anatolia 4 [1959] 129-63). PENDIK, SILE. Professor Sevket Aziz Kansu un- dertook a reconnaissance trip and made some soundings in the Anatolian region of Istanbul. Two caves in the cliffs near Sile were found promising. At Pendik, where a Palaeolithic hand-axe had been found years ago, an open site with Palaeolithic material was located (TTKR 1959, 17-18). CHALCOLITHIC AND BRONZE AGE SITES Ki LTEPE. The excavations at Kanesh, the old historical city in Cappadocia, produce their annual share of new and original material for archaeolo- gists and philologists alike. The following informa- tion is again derived from reports kindly furnished by Professors Tahsin and Nimet Ozgiig (for the previous campaign cf. AJA 64 [1960] 59; Tuirk Arkeoloji Dergisi 9.i [i9591 33-34; a new volume containing architectural studies has also appeared: T. Ozgii*, Kiiltepe-Kanif. New researches at the Center of the Assyrian Trade Colonies [Tiirk Tarih Kurumu, Ankara 19591). In the Karum, the commercial district beyond the city mound, levels Ib and II were further in- vestigated. Large buildings and magazines of level Ib were cleared. Their preservation was unusually good, which also applies to the tablets in them. The stamp and cylinder seal impressions charac- teristic of Ib clearly differ from those of level II. Among the notable finds are a mold for the making of figurines of the leading goddess of the Kiiltepe pantheon, accompanied by a male deity and an attributive animal; new forms of pottery, e.g. large drinking cups in bull's head shape with stamp seal impressions. The information about the final stage of the colonies from Karum Ib fits in well with the comparative data from Alisar and BogazkiSy.</page><page sequence="3">1961] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 39 In level II the archive of a native merchant Pusu- Ahsu was excavated. He was a rich and important person. The house contained ten rooms and two stories. The magazines were on the ground floor. The central room is large; it has a bin for wheat in one corner, in the center is a fireplace, and along the walls run benches. Oven, kitchen and pantry are in separate rooms. In the pantry were found drinking cups in the shape of bull, buffalo, eagle and lion; also vases with relief decoration and pitchers with strainer spouts. The cylinder seal impressions found in level II this year are predominantly of the native style. The owners of the newly found archives were all natives. In spite of Mesopotamian influence, the features of the native style are clear. On the city-mound, some interesting stone-built Phrygian houses were cleared. Among the Phrygian painted pottery there are some vases painted with deer in a style somewhat different from the Alisar variety. Most of the work was devoted to earlier levels. The large building which corresponds to level II of the Karum was cleared further (cf. AJA 64 [1960] 59)- In one of the rooms of the residential wing two tablets were found. They are written in Assyrian script and language. There are bullae with impressions of cylinder seals of the native style, again corresponding to Karum level II. Prehistoric soundings reached the middle and early phases of the Early Bronze Age. There is good architecture, a variety of pottery, and large marble idols of some affinity to Cycladic types. The graves are cists built of stone. They have rich tomb- gifts, with the local variants of central Anatolian pottery but also with North Syrian imported pots. This discovery is important for synchronisms as it documents the connections with North Syria now as early as the Early Bronze Age; they continue in the next period as well known from the Karum. Professor Nimet Ozgiig published a selection of seals and seal impressions from Kiiltepe in Ana- tolia 4 [19591 43-53. HOROZTEPE. For a preliminary announcement of objects from Horoztepe (cf. T. Ozgiig and M. Akok, Horoztepe, an Early Bronze Age settlement and cemetery [1958] pls. xvIi-xIx) now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, cf. P. Oliver in BMMA (April 1960) 253-55. BOGAZKiY. Work at Bogazk6y continued with a concentrated effort to complete the excavation of the royal citadel, Biiyiikkale. Professor K. Bittel had the general direction (for reports on previous campaigns cf. AJA 64 [1960] 59-61; Tiirk Arkeoloji Dergisi 9.1 [19591 5-I0; Neue Deutsche Ausgra- bungen im Mittelmeergebiet und im vorderen Orient [Berlin 1959] 89-120); Dr. T. Beran was field director. The following account is an abstract of a detailed report kindly provided by Dr. Beran. It surveys the results from the upper, Roman levels down to the period of the Assyrian merchant colonies. Roman: a simple fortification wall ran along the south side and parts of the west side of the citadel (for a recent plan cf. Neue Deutsche Ausgrabungen 96, Beilage 2) with a gate in v/6. The upper two levels in the citadel are dated by coins to the period from Hadrian to Gallienus. Phrygian: the entire Phrygian citadel was sur- rounded by a fortification wall with towers, two gateways, and up to four phases of reinforcement and reconstruction. The original Phrygian wall in the southwest area stands on an artificial embank- ment which is carefully paved with stones on both sides. The wall itself is much less competently built of two shells with a rubble fill which repeat- edly needed repairs. Intensive habitation, according to ceramic evi- dence, does not antedate the eighth century B.c. Occupation of more or less Phrygian character lasted until the Hellenistic period, possibly inter- rupted by the raids of the Galatians. This period has up to six sub-levels. Hittite Empire: the plans of the Hittite buildings on the citadel were completed. Building E (which produced an archive of tablets in 1907) seems resi- dential. Several rooms are grouped around a central hall. The broad entrance room opens to the interior of the citadel on a higher level; staircases descend to the lower storey which corresponds to the lower level on the west side. The building measures about 25 by 20 m. Building F is larger, about 30 by 35 m. It is less well preserved and has an unusual plan. There are five parallel magazines flanked by L-shaped corri- dors, also two large rooms to the southeast and small rooms to the southwest. The building may have been a treasury or perhaps it represents the foundation for a pillared hall such as has been reconstructed for building D. Building K, on the southeast side of the citadel, measures 22.50 by 27.50 m. Parts of it had fallen</page><page sequence="4">40 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 65 down the steep rock after the destruction of the Hittite citadel, and the Phrygian east gate (where the Kybele statue-group was found) was built over it. This left building K in a poor state of preserva- tion. There was a series of small and probably open rooms facing the citadel. Two of the inner rooms were preserved, in one of which an archive was found in 1957. Originally the citadel wall had con- tinued without a break in the area of building K. When K was erected, the outer face of the citadel wall became the wall of the southwest part of K; it was extended to join the southwest bastion in Z/3-4. It is possible that a Hittite entrance existed between the southwest bastion and building K. In the southwest part of the citadel some re- markable architectural planning was discovered. A pillared hall enclosed the outer citadel court on the southeast and southwest sides, continuing the line of the northwest fagade of building G and parallel to the southeast border of building H. The southwest citadel gate lay about halfway up the slope. From there a fairly steep ascent led to the southeast-northwest part of the portico, which one entered and passed through to reach the outer citadel court. This court must have had porticoes on at least three sides. In the northeast corner a gate-building led, presumably via stairways, to the inner citadel court which was bordered by the fagades of building A and the throne-room D. The small finds from the Hittite level include a well preserved bronze dagger, a marble sword pommel, 21 seals and seal-impressions, 260 tablets or fragments thereof; mostly rituals for festivals, but also some historical fragments, letters, medical and omen texts. Pre-Empire levels: in the southwest area the excavation of a large building of level IV b was completed. This building continues constructions found in 1952 (cf. MDOG 86 [1953] 12-13, plan 2). Its core consists of a basement-like room of 4.50 by 9.50 m., which has large-scale and careful masonry on the interior wall-faces. The building preceding level IV b was of monu- mental size with walls to two m. thick built of large fieldstones. Elaborate terracing for this and the subsequent building had obliterated the orig- inal stratification, but an open space to the south- east contained a good sequence: first a mudbrick house on stone foundations, then a burnt level which ceramically could be equated with level IV c in the area of building G. Two unimportant strata separate this burnt level from an earlier, also burnt level with a monumental building. The walls stand to 2 m. height; seven rooms were en- tirely or partially cleared. There are two parallel rooms of ca. 8 by 3.50 m., smaller rooms lie on the west and north sides. The walls have stone founda- tions and a mudbrick with rubble superstructure in wooden frames. The collapsed ceilings of the lower floor were found partly intact. There was no earlier building on this spot; and the conflagra- tion of the building was followed by a period of abandonment. The burnt building had been thoroughly looted. It contained fragments of handmade, late Early Bronze pottery (derivatives of Alisar I types and some Alisar III sherds), but also some wheelmade examples of so-called Hittite ware. There are wheel- made buff cups and flaring bowls with stringcut bases in shape and technique reminiscent of Meso- potamian prototypes; also a fragment of a local variant of the "depas amphikypellon." All this suggests a Middle Bronze date, the burnt building being contemporary with the entire Assyrian colony period. The conflagration could be attributed to the conquest and destruction of Hattus by Anitta of Kussar and Nesa. Previous results of excavations in the city area (MDOG 89 [1957] 8ff, 68ff) are in agreement with this, since they also point to a gap in occupation after level 4 which is dated to the time of Anitta. To the southeast, the area of building K and the area between K and A also contained several pre- Empire levels. The Old Hittite constructions here were rather modest, but a fourth, burnt, pre- Empire level was identified; also an earlier sixth stratum which has signs of a general conflagration and in finds is to be correlated with the lowest level in the southwest area. In the northeast room of building K, below the burnt stratum of VI, a very early pithos was found immediately above bedrock. It is handmade, ovoid, brown-buff slipped and burnished, and decorated with irregular black vertical lines; the pot seems unique so far. Excavations on Biiyiikkale have now been terminated. Further historical evidence will be forthcoming from the rich deposits in the lower city to which the next campaigns will be devoted. ILICAPINAR. J. Mellaart published the neolithic surface finds from Ihlcapmnar, ca. eight miles south of Cihanbeyli on the road from Ankara to Konya (Istanbuler Mitteilungen 8 [1958] 82-92). The</page><page sequence="5">1961] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 41 obsidian implements from here are related to the obsidian industry of Mersin (lance- and arrow- heads), but also to the implements found at Qukurkent east of Lake Beysehir and to those at Qatalhiiyiik, the large neolithic mound north of Qumra (southeast of Konya, cf. AJA 64 [1960] 61-62). KARAHtiYjiK. No campaign was conducted here in 1959. HACILAR. The careful excavation of the early settlement in the Burdur area went into its third season under the direction of Mr. James Mellaart. The following, detailed account has kindly been provided by him (for the previous season, cf. AJA 64 [i960] 62-63; AnatSt 9 [I9591 51-65; Tiirk Arkeoloji Dergisi 9.1 [I9591 23-24). "At the end of the previous season we had estab- lished the presence of a large fortified Level I settlement surrounding the remains of burnt Level II houses on top of the mound. We had not been able to reach the outer wall of the Level I forti- fications and this evidently was one of the 1959 season's objectives. Moreover, a small trench link- ing the remains of both settlements dug in 1958 had encountered part of a big wall, suggesting that the Level II settlement also had been con- tained within an enclosure. A trench 55 m. long and 5 m. wide was laid out at the beginning of the season on the western half of the mound. At the end of the first week we had determined the western limit of both Level I and Level II settle- ments by finding both enclosure walls. It was decided to concentrate on obtaining the maximum amount of architectural information about both the Level I fortress and the walled settlement of Level II. Seven earlier building levels remain to be explored. "The Level I fortress. Mr. David Stronach was put in charge of the clearance of another section of the fortress and linking it up with the previously excavated block of rooms in Area E. The outer wall was not found until the last day and it there- fore could not be traced around the block so that the main entrance has not yet been found. Many rooms are again of impressive proportions and once more there is evidence for at least one upper storey. Two great insulae have now been excavated. "This fortress consisted of an open area ca. ioo meters in diameter, enclosed by blocks of rooms grouped into large insulae radially arranged. Be- tween them, walled courtyards gave access into the fortress. Its full diameter was probably ca. 150 meters (larger than Troy II), but unlike Troy, the absence of dwellings within the enclosed open area suggests that the ruler's 'palace' should be sought among the insulae. "The remains of poorly built stone walls in that area appear to belong almost entirely to the period immediately post-dating the destruction of the fortress (phase Ic). It may now be suggested that the main settlement had then moved some 400 yards northwards to a new site west of the present village. Hacilar I pottery has been found there as well as Late Chalcolithic of Beycesultan type and Southwest Anatolian Early Bronze II. "The Level II settlement. Three quarters of the settlement have now been excavated and we have a unique opportunity to observe the layout of an early chalcolithic settlement. An area of about 57 x 36 meters on top of the mound was surrounded by a wall, 1.50 to 3.00 meters thick and provided with small towers or buttresses. Narrow passage- ways led into the settlement and could be closed by a door. Proper gates as such did not exist. Three of these entrances have been found: two in the north wall, a third in the south wall, but none in the short west wall. Only one of these three doorways led straight into a house; the others led through a passage or anteroom into the west and south courts respectively. "The houses were arranged around courts. Two pairs of small houses, each with an anteroom and a main room, are placed on either side of the northwest entrance passage. Their walls are very thick and an upper storey might have existed, also covering the entrance passage. To the west lay a granary and facing the houses across the west court were two larger buildings. "In the eastern half of the settlement we have evidence for two phases, with a complete rebuild- ing after a disastrous fire. Here we found a well appointed building with plastered floors and walls and elaborate colonnades. Several doorways led from it into a series of courtyards, separated by partitions and each provided with a raised hearth with a bread oven behind it and numerous other domestic arrangements. This area produced many pottery vessels about half of which were gaily painted. From a stone-lined well in one of the courtyards a considerable quantity of carbonized wheat, barley and almonds or plumstones was re- covered. The large house produced another sur-</page><page sequence="6">42 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 65 prise: sunk in its floor one single and two double burials were found, a feature hitherto not en- countered at Hacilar. The dead had been buried in tightly contracted position without any con- sistent orientation; the only funerary gifts were some finely painted pots. A few other fragmen- tary skeletons were found in the burnt debris of the house. This skeletal material will be examined in Ankara. "Although the most important results of this year's work at Hacilar are definitely in the field of architecture, not less than a hundred painted vessels were found, mostly new types, as well as numerous small objects including the first com- plete figurine." We illustrate, with Mr. Mellaart's and the own- er's kind permission, an anthropomorphic painted vessel from Hacilar Level I (pl. 23, figs. I-2; height ca. o.225m.); in the collection of Mr. Hiiseyin Kocabas in Istanbul. The lower part is incomplete and incorrectly restored. The eyes are inlaid with obsidian. BEYCESULTAN. Mr. Seton Lloyd devoted a sixth campaign to the large site of Beycesultan in the upper Maeander valley. He kindly reports the following details on the season of 1959 (for previ- ous reports, cf. AJA 64 [1960] 63; AnatSt 9 [1959] 35-47). "The work was concentrated entirely on the Middle Bronze Age palace (ca. 1900-1750 B.c.), partly excavated in 1954 and 1955 (cf. AnatSt 6 [1956] io6ff). A further section of the building covering an area of about two thousand square meters was successfully cleared and recovered. "The remains of the palace were reached suc- cessively in two areas; one covering almost the whole north-eastern part of the main building and the other revealing a completely new wing to the west of the central courtyard. The former, as ex- pected, required much patience in excavation, since the ruins here had been deliberately denuded and levelled down to the original pavements, in order to provide an emplacement for the buildings of a 'squatter' population in Level IV. Some measure of the city's impoverishment after the fire could be gathered from the fact that a single chamber in the palace could accommodate a complete dwell- ing-house of the returning inhabitants. The align- ment of the walls could only be determined by meticulous cleaning; but the plan, with the ex- ception of certain unlocated doorways, was eventu- ally completed. "In the newly discovered western wing, how- ever, the circumstances were entirely different. In this quarter, a striking phenomenon, hitherto un- observed, perhaps owing to later denudation, was the collapsed remains of an upper storey, which in some cases had had the effect of 'blanketing' the fire beneath and preserving the walls from total destruction. These in certain places remained stand- ing to more than two meters high, with their elaborate framework of timber beams and posts virtually intact, so that at last this ingenious system of 'half-timber' construction could be studied in detail (pl. 23, fig. 3). The size and quantity of timber used, including the great 'rafts' of tree- trunks forming the foundation of the walls them- selves, when thus seen almost perfectly preserved by carbonization, were almost beyond belief. So also were the remains of the upper floors. These had in many cases collapsed almost intact into the chamber beneath, carrying with them the thick layers of rushes and straw (sometimes up to 12 in. deep), with which they were covered and the lighter framework of the roof above. In one place a charred door remained standing in place, made from a single plank 140 m. wide; in an- other the wooden threshold was preserved with part of the bronze cup in which the door-pivot revolved. The fallen remains of first-floor struc- tures now also enable one to estimate the scale and accommodation of the building, including the huge chambers of the upper storey. These, often extending inwards over the colonnade which evi- dently surrounded the central courtyard, recall the piano nobile of the Cretan palaces. But here the ground-floor chambers also are of a corresponding size, one measuring more than fifteen meters square. "The plan of the palace also is of increasing interest. The west wing, now excavated, incorpo- rates what might be described as a monumental entrance passing through a portico with pairs of recessed niches on either side (cf. pl. 23, fig. 4). This provides a main axis for the building, terminating in what appears to be a main stair- way leading to the upper floor on the opposite side of the courtyard. With the limits of the plan so far determined only on the southern and south- eastern sides, the building can now be seen to have a maximum dimension of at least eighty meters</page><page sequence="7">1961] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 43 and the numbered chambers on the ground floor alone have reached over forty. By contrast, the ruins continue to be totally unproductive of ob- jects. The absence even of broken pottery and other litter which would result from looting, be- gins to suggest that the palace must have been deliberately and totally evacuated, perhaps in antici- pation of the military disaster which resulted in its destruction." IZMIR-BoRNOVA. A prehistoric mound and cem- etery were discovered when the foundations for a new building of Bornova College were being made. Several complete vases of Early Bronze Age type were found. An excavation is being planned by Mr. Hakki Giiltekin (who will publish a pre- liminary report in Belleten) and Professor M. Senyiirek. MYSIA. D. H. French, scholar of the British In- stitute of Archaeology at Ankara, made a survey of the plains of Balikesir, Akhisar and Manisa (Magnesia ad Sipylum). He has recorded a con- siderable number of mounds with pottery ranging from Chalcolithic to the Late Bronze Age. KiPTAHYA. A Bronze Age mound called Seyit Omer hiiyiik, about ten miles from Kiitahya and in the area of lignite mines, is threatened with de- struction because of the mining operations. It has material of the Early Bronze Age. BITHYNIA. J. Mellaart in the spring of 1960 further explored the region of Iznik (Nicaea) and Inegil1 in western Bithynia, finding much early pottery: Chalcolithic wares different from those found at Fikirtepe, various Early Bronze Age wares and much Anatolian "Minyan" ware of light gray, red and buff varieties (cf. Istanbuler Mitteilungen 6 [19551 52-74). DORAK-TRoY II. J. Mellaart's announcement of a treasure of the type and period of Schliemann's Troy II hoards has appeared in ILN (November 28, 1959) 754, pls. i-ii. The objects come from two cist-graves alleged to have been excavated at Dorak on the south shore of the Lake of Apollonia (Apolyont G6lii west of Bursa) in the early I920'S. The weapons, metal vessels and jewelry are strik- ingly rich in decoration with imported materials (lapis, rock crystal, carnelian, amber, ivory) and show affinities to the Aegaean ornamental reper- toire. The associated fragment of Egyptian furni- ture, a piece of gold casing with the cartouche of Sahure, may turn out to become a precious chrono- logical link if the context of the finds can be veri- fied beyond doubt. EDIRNE. Professor Sevket Aziz Kansu has identi- fied a prehistoric site, Qardakalti, some three miles to the northwest of Edirne (Adrianopolis). It is a flat settlement with much pottery, polished axes and animal bones. The pottery is primitive, hand- made, gray to reddish or black, decorated with incised lines, dots, spirals and nail impressions. Traces of hearths were observed. There was no metal among the surface finds. Further investiga- tions are planned (TTKR 1959, 18-19). IRON AGE AND CLASSICAL SITES ANKARA. The new Cybele-Kubile relief found at Bahqelievler in 1959 has now been published by Raci Temizer in Anatolia 4 [1959] 179-87. He dates the relief to the sixth century B.c., rejecting the possibility that this and similar Cybele reliefs would represent a Phrygian type independent of Greek archaic art. The question is still open to some doubt; it will be discussed further in a forthcoming publication of the Phrygian cult-relief from Bogazk6y by K. Bittel; and also by the writer of this report in connection with material from Gordion (cf. AJA 64 [1960] 188). GORDION. A report on the excavations of 1959 by R. S. Young has appeared in this journal 64 [1960] 227-43. For the campaign of 1958, cf. also Tiirk Arkeoloji Dergisi 9.1 [19591 ]2-13; for a report on glass finds cf. Journal of Glass Studies I [I959] 22-49. AMORIUM-HERGAN KALE. This Phrygian site, a large mound to the southwest of Pessinus was in- vestigated by Nezih Firatlh. He made a sounding and found strata with Phrygian and Hittite pot- tery underlying the Byzantine remains. A survey was made and the most important buildings were located. The Byzantine era is clearly the most im- portant phase of the site. ALTINTEPE. This site mentioned in the previous report (AJA 64 [1960] 64) has now become a major factor in comparative Urartaean studies. Profes- sors Tahsin and Nimet Ozgiig and architect Mahmut Akok undertook a successful excavation in the fall of I959. They kindly allow us to quote the following details from their reports and descrip- tions. Altmntepe is a high hill, partly natural, some fifteen miles east of Erzincan on the road to Erzurum. It has an Urartaean citadel on top and</page><page sequence="8">44 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 65 a cemetery on the southeast slope. In 1938 the first tomb was found by chance; some of its objects found their way to the museum in Ankara. This tomb was not completely excavated. Another tomb was found next to the first one in 1956 and robbed. In 1959, the excavators cleared the floor of this tomb and found scraps of its contents. The tomb was built in good masonry; it had three rectangular rooms connected by interior doors; the roof was made as a pseudo-vault with one course of curved masonry and one overlapping flat course. The roof- ing stones were covered with a layer of rubble and earth. In 1959, a third tomb was discovered. It, too, had three rooms, built of very fine masonry. Its roof was covered with large flat slabs. The roofstones had been cracked by earthquakes and had fallen into the tomb chambers, thus crushing many of the objects inside, but the tomb was unplundered. The rooms were connected by doorways which were closed by stone doors. Rooms 2 and 3 each had several empty niches in the walls. In room I, which had the outer doorway, the following objects were found in various locations but neatly arranged: a large bronze cauldron containing small bronze vessels, iron weapons, small bronze protomes of horses (originally fast- ened to iron rods), tools used for the making of furniture. Also: various pieces of horsegear and chariot harnesses, horsebits, bells. The horsebits had cheekpieces decorated with animal heads dif- ferent on each side, e.g. bridled horses (pl. 24, fig. 5), bulls, eagles. Additional finds were iron axes, arrowheads, spearheads, knives, pickaxes; metal and wooden parts of a wooden throne and dais; vases, bone objects. The wooden throne had metal fittings on its legs in the shape of lion's and bull's feet, cast in bronze; these stood on an attached dais with separate moldings. There also were volutes and pendant leaves in bronze. A thin sheet of bronze, ca. 10 cm. high and over 50 cm. long was probably the metal revetment of a leather belt; it has engraved and embossed friezes in three tiers. Between guilloche borders above and below, one sees a neat arrangement in a free field of run- ning figures, each one repeated vertically three times: horned lions, horsemen with spears, bulls, winged centaur-archers, lions, winged bulls; a richer variety of motifs than found on the shields from Toprakkale and Karmir Blur. A bronze disc of 8 cm. diameter has a design of a winged deity standing on a galloping winged horse; another has a similar deity (a goddess?) standing on a winged horned lion. These discs had perforations along the edges and probably were meant to be fastened to the leather horsegear. The second room contained two stone sarcoph- agi, both with plain lids and trough-shaped. One contained the skeleton of a woman, the other a man. Outside of the man's sarcophagus were an iron shield, arrowheads, a throne and three vessels. There also had been a garment decorated with gold, silver and precious stones. With the woman in the coffin were found a number of gold discs, finely decorated with rosettes in granulation (probably ornaments of her dress) and tubular, triple and quadruple, granulated beads. These are the best pieces of gold jewelry known so far from Urartaean sites. Near the sarcophagus were found a throne, two pottery vessels, an imported Assyrian faience vase, gold and silver ornaments. Room 3 contained a throne, a bed, pottery jugs and plates, a small silver rod the ends of which were shaped as lions' heads. The metal fittings of the furniture legs here were made of silver. The chronological position of the new finds is in- dicated by two inscriptions in Urartaean cuneiform discovered on a bronze cylindrical revetment. They give the names of the Urartaean kings Rusa I (ca. 733-714 B.c.) and his son Argi'ti II (ca. 714-68o B.C.). Another important discovery was made at Altintepe in the form of an open cult-place near the tombs. In an artificially levelled area stand five tall stones, round-topped stelae of ca. three meters height, on a long flat base. The stones are very neatly worked but uninscribed and unadorned. Opposite the center of the base lies a round altar slab with a hole in the middle. This undoubtedly is a cult-place connected with the tombs. The excavations are continuing in i960. An in- vestigation of the citadel mound is tentatively planned for 1961. VAN-TO-PRAKKALE. Professors Afif Erzen and Emin Bilgig conducted investigations in the area of Van for the Turkish Historical Society. An excavation was begun at Toprakkale near Van. The site of the temple of Haldi, excavated but hardly published by Rassam and later by Lehmann-Haupt and Belck (cf. R. D. Barnett in Iraq 12 [1950] 1-43; i6 ['9541 3-22) and mostly denuded now, is being cleared and measured.</page><page sequence="9">1961] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 45 Within the area of the temple, starting at the outer west wall, the rock was found to have been cut in broad steps to support the massive temple foundations. In the middle of the terrace was a channel which led out of the temple. The founda- tions of the south and north walls of the temple were identified, the entrance was to the east where the rock was levelled. In another trench on the south side of Toprak- kale a mudbrick wall running east-west was ex- posed; it is about two meters thick and has stone foundations. North of this wall, a large quantity of Urartaean pottery was found; parallel to the wall, further to the north, lay fifteen large storage jars in three rows. Among the pottery were plates and trefoil pitchers with ribbon handles. Concen- tric rings of black and white stone, part of floor mosaics also found by Lehmann-Haupt, were again in evidence (TTKR 1959, 28-30). Professor E. Bilgig also published some new in- scriptions from the citadel at Van, duplicates of previously known texts in Tuirk Arkeoloji Dergisi 9.1 (I959) 44-48. HARRAN. During the excavations of Professor D. Storm Rice, which are chiefly concerned with the Great Mosque (cf. AnatSt 8 [1958] 35; for a plan of Harran AnatSt I [1951] 85) a trial trench was made in the ancient mound. Samples of Late and Middle Bronze Age materials were found. KARATEPE. Archaeological and building opera- tions continued through the year 1959 under the direction of Professor Halet 9ambel (cf. AJA 64 [196o] 64) to whom thanks are due for the follow- ing information. The restorations and protection of the monu- ments are nearing completion. Both gates have now been covered by concrete and glass roofs which are designed to create a maximum of light and a minimum of visual interference with the sculptured orthostats. As the stones were develop- ing new cracks while exposed to sun and rain, the present solution which makes an open air museum of Karatepe seems a happy one. The site now also boasts a guest-house, a museum, a forestry post, a police station, a post-office and a school! Work on the sculptures continues. New frag- ments are still being discovered, some of them be- longing to new orthostats. An elaborate network of Roman water conduits was discovered on and near Karatepe (TTKR 1959, 24-25). MIsIs-MoPSOUHESTIA. Professor Bossert continued his excavations on a small scale (cf. AJA 64 [1960] 65; Tiirk Arkeoloji Dergisi 9.1 [19591] 1). He kindly provided the following information. Byzan- tine cisterns still present obstacles to stratigraph- ical research, but one trench is slowly continuing down to pre-Roman levels. Among the finds of later levels, Byzantine glazed pottery is outstand- ing. Byzantine glazed wall-tiles also occur. These wares were locally produced in Mopsouhestia. Misfired samples of Byzantine glazed ceramics have been found. The Iron Age is so far announced only in fragments of painted pottery of the black- on-red variety with concentric circle decoration. YESEMEK. A new campaign was devoted to the quarries at Yesemek, ca. 15 miles southeast of Islahiye, under the direction of Professor Bahadir Alkim (cf. AJA 64 [i960] 64-65; Belleten 93 [i96o] I-Io). Professor Alkim kindly allows us to quote the following details from his reports on Yesemek and the Islahiye district. Yesemek preserves a large quantity of unfinished reliefs and statues of the second and first millennia B.c. Among the newly discovered reliefs were a chariot scene, two winged lions, a monster with a human body and a bear's head, and another re- lief of two mountain gods seen frontally (pl. 24, fig. 6). The blocks, which weigh from two to twelve tons, were mechanically lifted and set up for study. Among the roughly blocked out relief designs, six types of gate lions, four types of sphinxes, three types of mountain gods were re- corded (cf. the relief with three mountain gods en face, pl. 24, fig. 7), also two types of statues in the round. The popularity of the reliefs with two mountain gods (23 specimens), executed in the Hittite style of the second millennium, is indica- tive of the cult of mountain gods in this area, and also shows that many places in the vicinity of Yesemek sent in orders to this quarry. More in- formation was gathered about the methods of quarrying and the various stages of sculptural proc- esses. ISLAHIYE DIsTaIcT (cf. AJA 64 [196o] 65). Pro- fessor Alkim also made further explorations in the general district of Islahiye, where he recorded 20 previously unnoticed mounds. This completes the survey of the plains of Sakgag6zii, Zincirli, Altmtop and Hassa, which links up with the Braidwood survey of the Amuq area up to Kirikhan (R. J. Braidwood, Mounds in the Plain of Antioch [Chi-</page><page sequence="10">46 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 65 cago 1937]). Two mounds southeast of Hassa de- serve special mention, upper and lower Karafakilh. They are fortified sites of the early first millennium B.C., with stone circuit walls standing up to 0.50- 1.00 m. TILMEN HiYiiPK (cf. AJA 64 [1960] 65). A sounding was made on this mound by the expedi- tion under the direction of Dr. Bahadir Alkim. The site rises 22 m. above the plain, but is based on a flat natural rock. There are inner and outer fortification walls built of dry stones. The outer wall has two monumental gateways to the north and east; the fallen gate lion of the east gate was re-erected. The sounding went down 5.60 m. from the top of the mound. Four main levels were dis- tinguished. The upper level (Ia and b) is Iron Age, 9th-8th century B.c. Level II is second millen- nium and ends in a conflagration; level III also is burnt. Two cist-graves of children were found in it. The pottery of III belongs to the third mil- lennium. Level IV has pottery resembling Ubaid and Mersin wares, also many flint tools. Bedrock has not yet been reached. The site promises to be an interesting transitional station between North Syria and Anatolia. SIDE. Professor Arif Milfid Mansel conducted another campaign during the summer of 1959 (cf. AJA 64 [1960] 65). More work was done on the stage building of the theater. The outer galleries and the vaulted rooms behind them were cleared in a section near the colonnaded street; Byzantine mosaics were found as secondary floors in the cor- ridor and rooms. The large colonnaded street in front of the theater was completely excavated; restoration of the Corinthian columns of the west stoa has begun. Near the north end of this stoa a hoard of ca. 800o silver Crusader coins and ingots was found. Next to the theater and behind the colonnaded street, a podium temple emerged, probably of late Hellenistic date. It is pseudo-dipteral with a stair- case on the front, an anteroom and a cella deco- rated with half-columns. Outside of the late city-gate stood three fountain- houses. One was dedicated by Vespasian but it had obviously been moved from its original site. Op- posite this building and in front of a large cistern which faced the colonnaded street were two more fountain-houses; one was of a round plan, the other had three basins set among four piers with an elaborate interior architecture of aediculae and colonnades. Several statues were found here, e.g. a Hermes, a headless Athena and the head of a youth, perhaps Apollo. Work on the local museum continued. This is being arranged in a restored ancient bath. The sculptures will be transported to the ancient rooms which have been cleared of later additions (TTKR 1959, 21-22). XANTHOS. This site is now being studied for publication. The pottery, a considerable amount of which is of local and East Greek fabrics, is be- ing analyzed by Professor H. Metzger. The ex- pedition to Xanthos has so far not found any Bronze Age materials on the site of the two main citadels. It would seem that erosion and rebuilding cannot be responsible for the total disappearance of earlier remnants. The Bronze Age capital of Lycia presumably had a different location, not necessarily far removed from Iron Age Xanthos. MARMARIS. Professors J. M. Cook and G. E. Bean in the summer of 1959 began an excavation at an ancient sanctuary site on a mountain crest above Hisaranii in the Carian Chersonese, west of Mar- maris. Fuller investigations were made in the summer of 1960 by J. M. Cook in conjunction with W. H. Plommer and K. J. Frazer. Professor Cook kindly reports the following: "The modern name of the place is Pazarlik; and the ancient name was Kastabos, this being proved by identification of the sanctuary as that of Hemi- thea about which Diodorus writes at length. The deme site on the coast below, commonly marked as 'Erine,' must in fact be Bybassus. "The temple was of limestone with the exterior order in marble; it proves to have been hexastyle Ionic with twelve columns on the long sides, and it seems to have been built in the second half of the fourth century B.c. The elevation can be restored almost complete. A Corinthian capital was discov- ered in the debris in 1959, but it cannot now be regarded as belonging to the original design of the building. The main doorway at the east end of the cella presents a problem. The capacious threshold, standing nearly two feet high above the pronaos floor and decorated with a Lesbian leaf moulding at its foot, looks more like a platform than a thor- oughfare; and in front of it, blocking access to the door, stood a circular basis of red stone which may have carried a sculptured marble drum. But no trace has been found of a second entrance to the cella. At the back end of the cella was a naiskos;</page><page sequence="11">1961] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 47 inside it, cut in the rock, was a shallow basin which must have served cult purposes. In front of the naiskos some silver coins and 170 small bronze ones (probably all of Rhodes) were found in the pack- ing under the cella floor. A threshold and traces of the walls of an earlier building were found bedded on the rock here. "The temple was built on a massive platform revetted by walls of polygonal masonry. The fore- court was bordered by a screen wall and aediculae carved in limestone in a manner resembling the 'First Pompeian Style.' On the east side of this court, facing the temple, were two single-room buildings of fourth-century date. Unfortunately the excavation shed no light on the use to which these rooms were put; but their roofs seem to have fallen in about 200 B.c. or not much later. The last set of tiles here came from the factory of one Tymnias, who may have given the tiles for some of the buildings as a thank-offering for a victory in the Sminthian games (presumably those of Lindos). In the front wall of one of these buildings is the record of the dedication of the temple by a Hygassian. A second inscription came to light on a block of the 'Pompeian' surround. This records that two Halicarnassians wrought the temple, and seems to indicate that the 'Pompeian' surround was erected in the fourth century. A number of statue bases have been found, but unfortunately the statues have not survived. "On the south side of the temple platform a ramp head has been cleared. This formed the top of a processional way which led up to the crest from the head of the valley below. At the foot of the road here are terraced esplanades and a theater i8o feet across. Traces of numerous buildings were noted in the scrub on the slopes, and a trial trench cut in the corner of a house yielded a deposit of classical lamps packed under the floor. A plan of the area has been made." MILETUs. A new excavation campaign took place in September-October 1959. The following details are taken from a preliminary report kindly made available by Professor G. Kleiner, who has suc- ceeded Professor C. Weickert as field director (cf. for previous campaigns Neue Deutsche Ausgrabun- gen im Mittelmeergebiet und im vorderen Orient [Berlin 1959] i81-96; AJA 63 [i959] 81-82). I. The east trench. The first area of excavation was meant to determine the extent of archaic habitation east of the temple of Athena. Old trial trenches made to the west behind the bouleuterion in 1899 had produced archaic house walls (cf. AbhBerl 1901, 7 [909] and Milet I, 6, pl. 12, upper left corner, p. 89); these served as a starting-point. Under the mortar building with two apses and adjoining rectangular rooms (cf. Milet I, 6, plan p. 2) well built archaic walls and archaic pottery, mostly household ware, appeared in the first days of digging. There are two phases, the older of which, however, cannot go back much before 6oo B.c. A burnt destruction level is seen almost every- where; this can be identified with the Persian de- struction of 494 B.c. The classical reconstruction partly re-used the archaic foundations. Another great fire seems to have raged at the end of the classical period, which the excavators would rather connect with Alexander than with Maussolos (cf. RE 15 [1932] I6oif). The purpose of the buildings is suggested by large stores of classical amphoras, although these are fewer in the archaic level. A remarkable archaic building of megaron type has a hearth in the anteroom; the latter continued to be used after the destruction of 494 B.C. when the main room received a well preserved pebble pavement. One might think of a prytaneion be- cause of the proximity of the later bouleuterion. The archaic streets apparently correspond to the later Hippodamian system! It has not yet been possible to record coherent house-plans, since later constructions proved even more radical to the west in the area of the late Hel- lenistic storage building which has very deep foun- dations (Milet I, 7, I56ff). Two more trenches were opened in this direction, only one of which pro- duced an archaic wall running east-west. The two destruction levels, archaic and late classical, were evident in both trenches. To the north of the archaic wall, bronze and iron slag and a water- channel built of roof-tiles suggest the presence of a forge, perhaps a harbor forge of the kind also discovered near the temple of Athena (cf. the forthcoming report in Istanbuler Mitteilungen 9). In the western part of the same trench, a Hel- lenistic (or earlier ?) subterranean vault was found. It is built of ashlar with niches for lighting; a stair- case and a small anteroom give access to the door. In late antique or Byzantine times a hole was made in the vault and the entire complex was remodelled as a well-house. Originally the building could have been a sanctuary, probably a heroon.

MELLINK [AJA 65 rooms read: NtK-q, NLKq" 'AprTepcvoq, also 'EXir8o0S and may refer to the old shrine. Among the upper buildings is a Roman house with a peristyle, deco- rated with a mosaic of fishes and other creatures of the sea. Unfortunately, the old excavations had disturbed the stratification to the level of the Roman Empire and sometimes even deeper. II. The southwest trench. The second aim was to test the size of the Mycenaean settlement to the southwest of the temple of Athena and to trace the great Mycenaean wall. At about 150 meters SSW of the temple a trench of 3 x 50 meters was made from the SW to the NE, starting in the area of the west wall of the historical city. The inner face of the Mycenaean wall, running N-S, was exposed at ca. 4 m. depth near the modern road crossed by the trench. To the west, the early Hellenistic city-wall ap- peared; in the upper levels, late antique houses. Continuous occupation could be traced back into the fourth century B.c., again with a late classical conflagration level. The archaic destruction of 494 B.c. was also clear, but this area at the western edge of the city seems to have been uninhabited for some time after the Persian attack. The late geometric burnt level known from the temple of Athena was also represented here. The shifting of the coastline from Mycenaean to late antique times was evident in the various sections. The oldest Miletus lay therefore south of the Athena temple, but the archaic city at least as early as the sixth century B.c. used the harbor of the Lion Bay. Its acropolis then was not on Kalabak Tepe but on theater hill, where indeed archaic sherds can be found. Kalabak Tepe merely had importance as a refuge castle in the Lydian and Cimmerian wars (cf. Istanbuler Mitteilungen 9, forthcoming). The question of the location of archaic Miletus can be considered solved if one takes into account the distance between the east and southwest trenches (half a mile as the crow flies). An excava- tion to the north on theater hill could remove the last vestiges of doubt. PANIONION. An illustrated report on the initial campaign appeared in Neue Deutsche Ausgra- bungen im Mittelmeergebiet und im vorderen Orient (Berlin 1959) 172-80; for the work in 1958 cf. Turii Arkeoloji Dergisi 9.1 (i959) 20-22. No excavations took place in 1959, but another spring campaign was conducted in 1960. Professor Kleiner kindly allows us to quote the following from his preliminary report on the final campaign at the site. At the beginning of the campaign, the necropolis on the east slope of the citadel hill (Kaletepe) was re-investigated (cf. the report in AM 12 [1887] 229ff). The burials had been laid in natural rock- crevices which had undergone little artificial im- provement. They were all disturbed, but there were enough bones and geometric sherds (the latter exclusively of the eighth century B.c.) to identify the site as the necropolis of Melie. About 500 meters to the south of the altar on the Panionion hill, a Carian tomb was identified. An oval wall of coarse masonry, poorly preserved, en- closed an area ca. 12 meters long and 7.50 meters wide. The most important discovery was that of a Hellenistic fortified post on a spur of Mykale im- mediately to the southeast of the Panionion hill. A watchtower rose in dominant position over the walls and buildings of a citadel clearly built as a stronghold for Priene, the city guarding the Pani- onion. The relationship is indicated by the style of masonry and by pottery, especially the finds from a cistern in the citadel. The sherds go back to early Hellenistic times; several are directly paralleled by household ware from Priene. With the excava- tion of this fortress the work at gamli was brought to a conclusion. EPHESUS. The excavations were temporarily sus- pended. Tuirk Arkeoloji Dergisi 9.1 (1959) 25-32 contains an illustrated report on the work accom- plished in 1958, cf. AJA 64 (i960) 66-67. KLAROS. Professor Louis Robert kindly continues his reports on the excavations in and around the temple of Apollo with the following news (previ- ous accounts in AJA 64 [1960] 66; Tiirk Arkeoloji Dergisi 9.1 [19591 35-36). The excavators (Profes- sor and Mme. Robert, Professor Roland Martin and Pierre Bonnard, architect) continued their soundings around the temple, this time to the east, to ascertain that there were no other build- ings in the sacred grove. The area immediately around the temple was cleared to improve the view and to collect what building blocks were still there. To the southwest lies the area where in Byzantine times people worked on the dis- mantling of the columns of the rear peristyle and</page><page sequence="13">1961] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 49 cella walls. To the southeast, a new Doric capital was found. To the northwest, behind the small Ionic temple, nothing more was discovered. In the process of recording all the fallen column drums, the eleven ton architrave block which carries the name of Hadrian was turned over. The titles in- dicate that the dedication does not antedate Decem- ber i35; it therefore belongs to the final period of his rule. The deep soundings were favored by an excep- tional drought in 1959 following a dry 1958. This allowed a complete clearing of the honorary bases and the exedra to the south of the temple fagade (pl. 25, fig. 8). Here was found the head of a sixth century kouros whose face is badly destroyed, but the hair and ears are very good; also an elegant head of a very young girl with traces of attach- ment of a metal wreath, probably late Hellenistic. R. Martin completed the deep soundings at the back of the subterranean adyton to find an earlier stage (pl. 25, fig. 9). The conglomerate which forms the foundation of the back of the cella has been provisionally removed over half its E-W length and its entire width. This foundation was put in when the colossal cult-statues of the Apolline triad were erected and when the two adyton rooms were vaulted over. In the earlier stage, the second room was as deep, E-W, as the first. All along the back wall ran a parapet in front of a basin of 6o cm. width. The well in the second room, just beyond the postern entrance (cf. AJA 62 [1958] 99), was therefore installed when the vaults were made and when the back part of the room was filled in. Al- though access to the prophetic waters was changed for technical reasons, the watertable remained the same. The floor of the subterranean rooms has many traces of re-use of blocks of earlier buildings which had existed on the same site but had to make room for the construction of the early Hel- lenistic temple; this is essentially the temple seen now with some modifications due to the first cen- tury B.C. The excavation was expanded especially around the great altar of Apollo and Dionysos, deities associated here and each provided with an offering- table. To the south, no results were gained by clearing a new area beyond the exedra. To the north results were more rewarding. When the passage between the temple and the altar was widened, important discoveries were made. North of the great altar, slightly projecting in front of it, stood a second, smaller altar. This altar, although rather far away from the small Ionic temple which we had attributed to Artemis Claria, faces this temple and must belong to it. Against its north side we found a headless, very archaic kore, of natural size. The lower part of the body is cylin- drical. One hand hangs down alongside the body, the other rests on the breast; a belt tightly en- circles the narrow waist. The statue has strong affinities to the kore of Auxerre in the Louvre. The statue, altar and the small temple are all identi- fied by an inscription on the left side of the statue: "Timonax, son of Theodoros, dedicated me to Artemis, having been the first priest (r6 r-p jrov LpEo/ra )." These finds are of great importance for the religious history of Klaros. The statue, chrono- logically, almost matches the Homeric Hymn. Near the altar, six altars stand closely together. They are of coarse stone and carry late inscriptions. Two are dedicated to Poseidon Themeliouchos and to the goddess of Miletus, Artemis Pythia. The following inscriptions deserve notice: an intact decree of the third century with very con- ventional formulas, but issued in honor of an officer of Ptolemy (probably Euergetes); which proves, contrary to previous opinion, an occupa- tion of Colophon by the Lagidai, as at Lebedos and Ephesus, and also, it seems to Professor Robert, at Teos; remnants of asyleia decrees; a list of a Chiote delegation to the oracle of the second century A.D.; small fragments of similar lists from Chios (with parasemon), Laodikeia of the Lykos, Akmonia, Amasia, Sagalassos and Philippopolis. The Roberts continued their explorations of the region of Colophon and Teos. Near Teos, in the village of Hereke which is full of ancient blocks, they identify an ancient Charax. A dark blue marble block was found here with an engraved fourth century design (a combat of a Greek and two Amazons), similar to the stelae from Chios and Boeotia. The block was removed from under- neath a well-head and is now in the museum at Izmir. SARDIS. The second campaign at Sardis was again under the direction of Professors G. M. A. Hanf- mann and A. H. Detweiler. The vast extent and the long history of the site are reflected in the wide range of the material gathered in various trenches. (For interim reports cf. AJA 64 [1960] 67-68; Archaeology 12 ['959] 283-84; Journal of Glass Studies I [i9591 51-54; Tiirk Arkeoloji Dergisi 9.1</page><page sequence="14">50 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 65 [1959] 14-19; Istanbuler Mitteilungen 8 [1958] 126- 30; BASOR 157 [1960] 8-43; Anatolia 4 [1959] 55- 65). Mr. Hanfmann kindly furnished the following notes on the new campaign: "While our finish was not quite as dramatic as last year's, yet one of the most important discov- eries was made on the last day of large-scale dig- ging-an imperial inscription mentioning a Sebastos and a Julia Sebaste was found to the east of the Roman gymnasium known as Building B. Here we are uncovering remains of a large colonnade and of an imposing gate with fragments of orna- mental marble architecture. Among them are two large Corinthian capitals adorned with heads of a laughing satyr and Athena (pl. 26, fig. io). In the great Building B itself we have cleared the southern part of the South Hall. The Byzantine shops south of the same building have developed into a regular shopping center with a long line of shops, some of which have mosaic floors. The most interesting unit among these is a shop which appears to have been converted into an early Chris- tian baptistery. To the west of B we made an at- tempt to trace the western boundary of what ap- pears to be another large pillared structure. Built against its outer pillars was an elaborately con- trived public latrine, which, like the Byzantine shops, appears to have functioned until the de- struction of the entire area during the reign of the Emperor Heraclius. Abundant finds of coins, glass and pottery were made; also some interesting sculptures, a torso of Athena (pl. 26, fig. ii) and a statue of Dionysos. "Across the road the residential 'House of Bronzes' presents a very favorable idea of Late Roman and early Byzantine Sardis. We nearly quadrupled the excavated area, of which the most imposing feature is a marble-paved unit where we still found in place a marble table as well as bronzes of the early Christian or early Byzantine era (pl. 27, fig. 14). Excavations on two terraces above the 'House of Bronzes' revealed that the great city-wall, which is several miles long, was constructed in this sector in one great effort ap- parently in the fifth century A.D. We found no evidence for any earlier fortification in this area. The flat-topped platform south of the city-wall yielded a great number of Hellenistic and Roman objects, including pieces of wall painting and some ivories. A charming fragment representing Hypnos is among the latter (pl. 26, fig. I2). "To the west of the area of the 'House of Bronzes' and partly under it, there appeared a cemetery of Roman and Hellenistic times. One small tomb with wall paintings was found under a room of the 'House of Bronzes'; others, less elaborate, yielded fine terracottas and glass. The Hellenistic tombs are fashioned like small bedrooms with two couches elaborately stuccoed and provided with head and shoulder rests. "Test pits in Building B revealed traces of previ- ous constructions of late Hellenistic or early Roman times. Below them at considerable depth, there came to light levels with Lydian and Greek pot- tery reaching at least as far back as the 7th century B.c. In the area of the 'House of Bronzes' and to the west, we were able to trace some walls of Lydian structures. Two major periods can be discerned. Abundant Lydian pottery and some fragments of Greek vases have been found. An unexpected bonus of the excavation of the 'House of Bronzes' was the find, quite near to the surface, of two Roman statues, husband and wife (pl. 26, fig. 13). "Farther out to the east we continued the excava- tion of Building CG. It has now become evident that our excavation has uncovered no more than a small fraction of a vast complex. The initial core of it is the large masonry structure described in the last report, but in Roman times halls and staircases were added to it which are apparently parts of a vast bathing establishment. These were submerged by floods which left deposits so high that by the middle Byzantine period only the upper story of the CG complex was in use. Our attempt to pene- trate to the bottom of the central structure led us downward to a lower floor and a firing chamber for the baths, but we were foiled in our attempt at deeper penetration by reaching the water table some 20 feet below the surface of the plain. "The collapse of the river bank of the torrent Pactolus in the winter of 1958/59 induced us to open a most rewarding though unscheduled sector. A Roman mausoleum produced the fragments of a luxurious marble sarcophagus as well as a marble portrait perhaps of a priest. Incorporated in the foundations of another Roman structure was a well- preserved Hellenistic chamber tomb. Its contents included a large Hellenistic vase decorated in painting and relief. The most promising develop- ment, however, was the emergence here of walls of several Lydian buildings, one of them of consid- erable size (cf. the sherd pl. 27, fig. i5).

"The yield in objects was even richer than last year. These were augmented notably for sculpture and inscriptions by a number of chance finds out- side the excavation." PERGAMON. The investigations in the Asklepieion, which were elaborately reported upon by Professor E. Boehringer in Neue Deutsche Ausgrabungen im Mittelmeergebiet und im vorderen Orient (Berlin 1959) I2l-7i, are still in progress. A study campaign is planned for the fall of i96o. QANDARLI-PITANE. A statue of an archaic kouros, intact but waterworn, was found in the necropolis of gandarli in the winter of 1958 (cf. Neue Deutsche Ausgrabungen i66f, figs. 34-35). Professor Ekrem Akurgal began excavations on the isthmus of the peninsula of Pitane where archaic sherds indicated the presence of a cemetery (for the topography of the site cf. Altertiimer von Pergamon I, i, 99f, map opp. p. 64; also J. Keil in RE 20, 1841-43). The tombs are found in a level ca. o0.50-I.50 m. below the surface and descend below groundwater level. In the upper soil there are some classical and Hel- lenistic sherds; some sarcophagi of these later phases are also found at a deeper level, but the tombs excavated chiefly belong to the first half of the sixth century B.c. Among the finds are Middle and Late Corinthian vases, late orientalizing ware, Naucratite cups, miniaturist cups, local wares and terracottas. The bodies (in the first half of the sixth century) were cremated in situ in the cemetery. Many vases also show traces of fire. The remnants of the body were deposited in jars of various sizes with vases as funeral gifts. The jars were closed with slabs or coarse stones. There was no special orientation of funeral jars and bodies. Stone circles of three to five meters in diameter were put around family grave-plots which were apparently covered with earth and marked. The excavations were continued in 1960 (TTKR I959, 22-24). DARDANOS-9ANAKKALE. A tumulus was discovered accidentally near the site of Dardanos, six miles to the southwest of 9anakkale, during the construc- tion of a water tower. Mr. Riistem Duyuran, Di- rector of the Museum of Istanbul, excavated the site in December i959. He kindly provided the fol- lowing details and illustrations. The tumulus was covered with trees and shrubs and had gone unnoticed for that reason (pl. 27, fig. 16). The tomb in it was built of ashlar masonry and consisted of a dromos, an anteroom and a main chamber. The dromos is 5.20 m. long; its walls lean inward and are roofed with flat slabs. The doorway to the anteroom also tapers up (1.57 m. wide at the base, i.ii m. at the lintel, height 1.70 m.). A Greek inscription of the fourth century B.c. is carved over the doorway. The corridor was filled with rubble to a level 50 cm. above that of the floors of the rooms. The rectangular anteroom measures 3.23 m. X I.24 m. with a height of 2.64 m.; its floor is covered with slabs which are clamped together. The ma- sonry is very neat and the blocks have a roughened surface. The front and back walls are inclined. The roofslabs are straight single pieces. Another fourth century inscription appears over the second door. The tomb chamber measures 3.23 X 3.65 m. The front and back walls are vertical to roof level, the side walls are vertical up to 1.48 m., then corbelled to form a gabled roof (pl. 28, fig. 17) to a maximum height of 3.28 m. The floor is paved, iron clamps are found in floor and ceiling blocks. Three benches of yellow sandstone stand in the tomb chamber (pl. 28, fig. 18). They have profiled legs and meas- ure 2.05 x 0.80 m. with a height of 0.60 m. Several skeletons were found stacked on each of them, side by side and on top of one another. Fallen bits of stone and broken pottery between the upper and lower skeletons proved that the burials had been made at intervals. The upper skeletons were well preserved and some of them had gold ornaments. There also were cremation burials. The ashes were contained in metal vases and wooden boxes together with some jewelry (earrings, bracelets). A total of twenty-five burials, cremated or otherwise, was found. The tomb gifts on the bodies, in the urns and in various places in the tomb chamber added up to about 400 items. There were 21 terracottas of various sizes, many with well-preserved polychromy and gilding (e.g. an Aphrodite); 78 unguentaria; many lamps of miscellaneous types, several with tall handles and lids; pottery cups, bowls, jars of glazed and unglazed fabrics; much glass; gold jewelry e.g. wreaths (pl. 28, fig. 19), diadems, neck- laces, pendants; silver (relatively little); bronze urns, two of them inscribed with the names of the cremated dead; bronze mirrors, bracelets, pins; ala-</page><page sequence="16">52 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AlA 65 baster bottles; bone rings, pins, spoons; a musical string-instrument of wood; wooden boxes; remains of shoes, combs, baskets, textiles. The tomb was built in the late fourth century B.c., used as a family vault until the first century B.c. when the dromos was closed with large blocks and covered with rubble, after which a tumulus was built over it which remained intact. A pre- liminary account appeared in the Belleten of the Turkish Touring and Automobile Club 218 (1960); a further report will be published in Anatolia 5. DASCYLIUM. Professor Akurgal continued his work at this site for about a month (cf. AJA 64 [1960] 68). More relief fragments were found, among them a slab with antithetical sphinxes in fifth century style, not part of the procession frieze found in other fragments. The sculptures are as- sembled in the Museum at Istanbul. There will be no work at Ergili in 1960. The inscribed bullae found at Ergili in 1952-55 have been published by K. Balkan in Anatolia 4 (I959) 123-28. IZNIK. Mr. Nezih Firath reports that the north and east city gates have been repaired. A useful small guide to the site has now appeared: Nezih Firath, Iznik (Nicee), son histoire, ses monuments (Touring et Automobile Club de Turquie [Istanbul 1959] i6 pages, illustrated). IZMIT-NICOMEDIA. The guide to this city (cf. AJA 64 [i960] 69) has also been published: Nezih Firatli, Izmit rehberi (Tiirkiye Turing Otomobil Kurumu [Istanbul 19591 40 pages, illustrated). ADAPAZARI. In the Annual of the Archaeological Museums of Istanbul 9 (1960) 73-76, figs. 9-14, the tumulus of Tersiyekiy near Adapazari is discussed by Nezih Firath (cf. AJA 64 [1960] 69). ISTANBUL. In the same Annual Riistem Duyuran published a preliminary report on the mosaics found opposite the Vilayet at Istanbul (cf. AJA 63 [i959] 85) which he dates to the fifth century A.D. The Annual also gives illustrations of the funeral reliefs found at Taskasap (Sehrimini, AJA 64 [1960] 69): figs. 30-31- In the gardens of the Sultan's Palace some archi- tectural fragments of a fourth century colonnade came to light during the construction of a new magazine. A Corinthian capital and a fragmentary unfluted column shaft of colossal dimensions are the impressive remnants of a presumably Theo- dosian building.
