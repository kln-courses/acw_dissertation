<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reification and the Cultural Hegemony of Capitalism: The Perspectives of / Marx and / Veblen / BY / JOHN P. DIGGINS Dourgeois society enjoys few friends among the intel- ligentsia, and capitalism, its lifeblood, is often treated pathologically, as though we all harbor a secret wish for its death. The "crisis" of capitalism has been proclaimed so often in the twentieth century that one begins to think its recovery is nothing less than a miracle in the cancer ward. Daniel Bell, whose latest book provides the most recent coroner's report, is clearly aware of the premature autopsies of the past, and he is too learned and experienced a thinker to engage in the sim- ple, one-dimensional diagnosis that occupied previous genera- tions of writers. Nevertheless, his analysis of the "modalities" of capitalism, its expressive and symbolic forms, is almost as gloomy as the analysis put forward by Marxists who concen- trate on the mode of production. Bell is convinced that con- temporary industrial society is entering a grave set of "cultural contradictions" because its bourgeois ethos has been super- seded by the "sensate" culture of modernism. The following passage describes vividly the world we have lost:</page><page sequence="2">MARX AND VEBLEN 355 The bourgeois world-view - rationalistic, matter-of-fact, prag- matic; neither magical, mystical, nor romantic; emphasizing work and function; concerned with restraint and order in mor- als and conduct - had by the mid-nineteenth-century come to dominate, not only the social structure (the organization of the economy), but also the culture, especially the religious order and the educational system which instilled "appropriate" motivation in the child. It reigned triumphant everywhere, opposed only in the realm of culture by those who disdained its un-heroic and anti-tragic mood, as well as its orderly attitude towards time.1 Is the value system of capitalism undergoing a crisis of legiti- macy? It is interesting that both Marxists and anti-Marxists (in some cases ex-Marxists) are willing to grant capitalism its as- cetic, rationalistic world view that was first formulated by Max Weber. Yet there is much in capitalism that is basically irra- tional and hedonistic, reflecting not so much the cool pru- dence of bourgeois man as perhaps the archaic traits of primi- tive cultures. Neither Marx nor Weber fully considered the possibility that modern capitalism could in some ways be in- terpreted as an anthropological problem, could be seen, that is, less as a unique "stage" or "spirit" than as a continuous mentality with roots deep in the preliterate communities of "barbarism." The attempt to explain the "higher" by the "lower" was the goal of Thorstein Veblen, the bane of capitalism and, as Perry Miller so aptly describe him, "the bard of savagery."2 The aim of this paper is to explore a question that has yet to be sufficiently answered: How is capitalist society possible? To state it another way, why does the hegemony of capitalist culture prevail and seemingly absorb all challenges, turning crises and apparent conflicts into further evidence of consen- sus? One way to approach this question is to examine the phenomenon of commodity fetishism that preoccupied the an- guished meditations of Marx and that served as the subject of 1 Daniel Bell, The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism (New York: Basic Books, 1976). 2 Perry Miller, American Thought: Civil War to World War I (New York: Rinehart, 1954), p. xlix.</page><page sequence="3">356 SOCIAL RESEARCH Veblen's wicked satires. By doing so we may discover that what sustains the culture of capitalism is not its economy but its sociology, not what men produce but what they consume - and why. Three Mysteries: Commodities, Money, Reification The issue of alienation which Marx explored in his 1844 manuscripts becomes, in Volume One of Capital, an aspect of "reification." This term, first coined by Georg Lukács in 1923,3 implies that products made by man come to assume in capitalist society an existence independent of man, "the erec- tion of an objective world of things" (Vergegenständlichung). In Capital and in the Grundrisse Marx's primary concern is the "mystery" of commodities, their ability to command human beings because of some inner "laws of motion" which inhere in their behavior and govern their exchange. Marx attempted to demystify the "fetishism of commodities" by distinguishing use-value from exchange-value in order to show how all prod- ucts in capitalist society lose their former quality when they come under the medium of exchange and the sphere of the "universal commodity" - money. In bourgeois society men persist in obscuring the extent to which the value of com- modities resides in the amount of socially necessary labor expended in their production. It could be said, as Michel Foucault has observed, that Marx, for all his dialectical skill in analyzing the phenomenal form of commodities, did little more than provide an "exegesis" of value mired in nineteenth-century assumptions.4 An equally telling problem in Marx's analysis of reification is the assumption that this phenomenon as expressed in the commodity fetish takes place 3 Georg Lukács, History and Class Consciousness: Studies in Marxist Dialectics, translated by Rodney Livingstone (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1971), pp. 83-222. 4 Marxism exists in nineteenth-century thought like a fish in water; that is, it is unable to breathe anywhere else" (Michel Foucault, The Order Of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences [New York: Vintage, 1973], pp. 261-262).</page><page sequence="4">MARX AND VEBLEN 357 with the historical development of capitalism. Marx was cer- tain that exchange relations emerge in fully developed form only when the idea of ownership emerges sufficiently to ren- der objects private and therefore alienable: Objects in themselves are external to man, and consequently alienable by him. In order that this alienation may be reciprocal, it is only necessary for men, by a tacit understanding, to treat each other as private owners of those alienable objects, and by implication as independent individuals. But such a state of re- ciprocal independence has no existence in a primitive society based on property in common, whether such property takes the form of a patriarchal family, an ancient Indian community, or a Peruvian Inca State.5 Must objects become "external to man" in order to be "alien- able"? Veblen once began an essay by quoting M. G. De Lapouge: "Anthropology is destined to revolutionize the polit- ical and social sciences as radically as bacteriology has revolu- tionized the science of medicine."6 It was from the research of Franz Boas that Veblen became familiar with the custom of potlatch, and he perceived in the high society of modern culture what ethnologists had discovered among Indians and natives: Costly entertainments, such as the potlatch or ball, are peculiarly adapted to serve this end [ostentation]. The competitor with whom the entertainer wishes to institute a comparison is, by this method, made to serve as a means to an end. He consumes vicariously for his host at the same time that he is a witness to the consumption of that excess of good things which his host is unable to dispose of singlehanded, and he is also made to witness his host's facility in etiquette.7 The French sociologist Marcel Mauss, Durkheim's successor who came to admire Veblen as the only American sociologist 5 Karl Marx, Capital (Moscow: Progress Publishers, n.d.), 1: 91. 6 Thorstein Veblen, "Why Is Economics Not An Evolutionary Science?" in his The Place of Science in Modern Civilization and Other Essays (New York: B.

Although the idea of ownership is implicit in the custom, potlatch itself does not depend on a well-defined system of private property and has little to do with commodity relations in the Marxist sense of the term. "This is not the ordinary world of toil and care, the calculations of advantage or the acquisition of useful goods," writes Johan Huizinga in Homo Ludens. It is a world of fantastic, lavish ritual that functions to distribute goods and even to destroy them, a system by which mutual relations and obligations are expressed in haughty challenges of personal esteem and dramatic contests of conspicuous waste, a custom in which gift-objects seem inseparable from the "spirit" of those who bear them. Huizinga believed that potlatch was another expression of the "play" element in human culture. More recently, anthropologists of different ideological persua- sions have attempted to offer a political meaning of the phe- nomenon. The French Marxist Maurice Godelier views pot- latch and similar rituals as an early expression of the "aliena- tion" of the donor in the mystic rites of exchange, while Marshall Sahlins believes that these festive rituals of primitive exchange provide the basis for "alliance, solidarity, communion - in brief, peace, the great virtue that earlier phi- losophers, Hobbes notably, had discovered in the State." 10 Interpreting such rituals as potlatch has led to a con- troversy, in the anthropological scholarship of economic in- 8 Joseph Dorfman, "New Light on Veblen," in Thorstein Veblen, Essays, Reviews and Reports: Previously Uncollected Writings, edited by Joseph Dorfman (Clifton, N.J.: A.

Hence he viewed potlatch as a form of strategic power moves dramatizing the relationship of domination to subordination. However one interprets the phenomenon, the upshot is that the "gift-ritual" compromises as well as complicates the dichotomy between use-value and exchange-value that is so central to Marx's theory of reification. Anthropologists have discovered among Indian tribes, especially those of the north- west coast of America, that the central feature of wealth is its display-value. Wealth may be found in consumable goods, but the more desired symbolic wealth derives from prestige goods of nonutilitarian worth - strings of dentalium shell, wood- pecker scalps, and large ceremonial obsidian blades.12 These objects serve to maintain, either through display or donation, the prestige and status of the owner. Such tribal customs would seem to indicate that Marx's categories of value are obscured in the continuum of reciprocity that characterizes primitive exchange and stresses the predominance of social functions over economic transactions. All this only goes to suggest that anthropology and ethnology provide ample evi- 11 C. Tullio- Altan, "La Teoria del valore-lavoro di K.

Veblen was not the first social scientist to be aware of the far-reaching implications of such rituals. But he was the first American scholar to use such anthropological data to demon- strate a point that would be articulated a half-century later by European philosophers like Jean Baudrillard and Jürgen Habermas: Marx's analysis of alienation and reification is too narrowly restricted to a discourse on production alone.13 The labor theory of value cannot be applied to precapitalist forma- tions, where use-value does not take the form of commodities. Nor in modern society can labor still be regarded as the dominant sphere of man's social activity. Veblen suggests why in modern society the ultimate problem is not production but consumption, not how goods come to be made but how they take on meaning. The role of meaning as a feature of the mediating tendencies of mind needs to be explored in relation to the "root of all evil" - money. In his 1844 notebooks Marx regarded money as an "alien medium" because it concealed the true value of labor and, as a vehicle of exchange, took on qualities external to man. With the prevalence of money man's slavery reaches its climax since all that represented human effort has been "transmitted" to an external agency that becomes an end in itself.14 In the Grund- risse Marx further insists that money is so abstracted from tangible wealth that it cannot even be regarded as part of reality: "As a general form of wealth money is confronted by the entire world of real valuables. Money is the pure abstrac- tion of the same - pure fantasy. Where wealth appears to exist in complete material, palpable form as such, money only has 13 Jean Baudrillard, The Mirror of Production, translated by Mark Poster (St. Louis: Telos Press, 1975); Jürgen Habermas, Knowledge and Human Interests (Boston: Beacon Press, 1971), pp. 1-63. 14 Karl Marx, "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts," in his Writings of the Young Marx on Philosophy and Society, edited by Loyd D.

The extent of the power of money is the extent of my power. The properties of money are the properties and essential powers of me - its possessor. Thus what I am and what I am capable of is in no way determined by my individuality. I am ugly, but I can buy the most beautiful woman. Therefore I am not ugly, for the effect of ugliness, its power of repulsion, is de- stroyed by money. I - according to my individual nature - am lame, but money gives me twenty legs, therefore I am not lame. I am a wicked, dishonest, unscrupulous, stupid man; but people honor money, and therefore also its possessor. Money is the highest good, therefore its possessor is good. Besides, money saves me the trouble of being dishonest; therefore I am presumed to be honest. I am stupid, but money is the real mind of all things; how can its possessor lack mind?16 Marx's writings on money bear a striking resemblance to the protests of seventeenth-century Puritans against the sins of covetousness. Both were convinced that "filthy lucre" would destroy all hope for human regeneration, and both recognized the Midas complex and its Faustian paradox: he who craves everything can enjoy nothing. The ancients were also aware, as were Rousseau, Thoreau, and other moderns, that wisdom begins with the cessation of desire; Aristotle observed that acquisitiveness, having no aim, has no limits. But such moral injunctions hardly exhaust the topic. Another way of ap- proaching the problem might be called the "sociology of money." Today French scholars like Roland Barthes and Jean Baudrillard are exploring the meaning of money, wealth, and commodities through the study of semiology, viewing their 15 Karl Marx, The Grundrisse: Foundations of the Critique of Political Economy, translated by Martin Nicolaus (New York: Random House, 1973), pp. 156-169, 222-230. 18 Karl Marx, Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, translated by Martin Milligan (Moscow, n.d.), pp. 136-138.</page><page sequence="9">362 SOCIAL RESEARCH various manifestions as a kind of sign language. Actually, this mode of analysis had been anticipated a half-century ago by the American sociologist George Herbert Mead. "Money," wrote Mead, is a symbol for something that is wanted by individuals who are in the attitude of willingness to exchange; and the forms of exchange are then the methods of conversation, and the media of exchange become gestures which enable us to carry out at vast distances this process of passing over something one does not want, to get something he does, by means of bringing himself into the attitude of the other person. The media of these tokens of wealth are, then, in this process of exchange just such gestures or symbols as language is in other fields.17 The problem that so deeply troubled Marx, the "mystification" of money and commodities, scarcely bothered Veblen, at least not in the same way. Money he could cheerfully dismiss as "the exact science of making change,"18 a form of communica- tion which, like language and gesture, suggests not the "objec- tification" of human relations and hence man's increasing privatization but his integration and socialization. With Marx he could agree that the money economy had something to do with the rise of surplus, but this development led not so much to the curse of exchange value in capitalism as to the logic of irrational superfluities, the drive toward conspicuous con- sumption that begins with archaic man. Men desire money simply because they desire goods. As a common denominator of exchange, money is nothing but the reification of the power of goods to command men's desires. Why then do men desire goods? We come again to the "fetishism of commodities." Although Marx recognized that all economic relations are social phenomena, he seemed to be indifferent to the cultural significance of commodities. Not only did he deny that com- 17 George Herbert Mead, Mind, Self, and Society from the Standpoint of a Social Behaviorist, edited by Charles W.

Veblen saw commodities as they first appeared in primitive form, as "organic extensions of personality" whose meaning is shaped by the animistic mind.22 Now a Marxist might grant that Veblen was correct about the status of objects in primitive society. With the advent of bourgeois capitalism, however, the "alien medium" of money comes between man and his objects and human relations are now externalized by exchange-value, a relation that relates only "thing to thing." It is precisely here that Veblen reverses the entire theoretical scheme of Marx's explanation of reifica- tion. The development of capitalism is not so deanimizing that total "objectification" takes place and the worker becomes a 19 "If it be declared that the social characters assumed by objects, or the material forms assumed by the social qualities of labour under the regime of a definitie mode of production, are mere symbols, it is in the same breath also declared that these characteristics are arbitrary fictions sanctioned by the so-called universal consent of mankind" (Marx, Capital, 1: 94). On money and language, see Marx, The Grundrisse, pp. 162-163. 20 "A commodity is, in the first place, an object outside of us, a thing that by its properties satisfies human wants of some sort or another. The nature of such wants, whether, for instance, they spring from the stomach or from fancy, makes no dif- ference. Neither are we here concerned to know how the objects satisfied these wants, whether directly as a means of subsistance, or indirectly as a means of production" (Marx, Capital, 1: 43). 21 Although Veblen had been greatly influenced by Hegel in his younger years as a student, the spell had been completely broken by the time he shifted his intellectual explorations from German philosophy to naturalistic economics. See Veblen, "The Socialist Economics of Karl Marx and His Followers," in his The Place of Science in Modern Civilization, pp. 409-456. 22 Thorstein Veblen, "The Beginnings of Ownership," in his Essays in Our Changing Order, edited by Leon Ardzrooni (New York: Viking Press, 1934), pp. 32-43.</page><page sequence="11">364 SOCIAL RESEARCH "slave" to a world of fetishized objects he can neither com- prehend nor control. On the contrary, the psychological bond between subject and object, between person and thing, is never completely dissolved. Indeed, if commodities become so abstract and depersonalized in their seemingly autonomous existence under capitalism, what explains the nature of their "fetishism"? Why are men so attracted to that which is appar- ently so alien to their being? For Veblen, who had been influenced by Kant and had studied under Charles Sanders Peirce, and who sensed the mediation of mind in every act of observation, the answer is obvious: Commodities retain a strong personal sign-character which enables man to impute to them human qualities which he can recognize. Man is not "mystified" by the cold, disem- bodied status of objects as mere objects. Rather he is awed by the commodity object as a symbol expressing the forceful and superior character of the person who possesses it. Ownership itself originates in bold feats of hunting and fighting, conquest and plunder. In the mind of primitive man living in the predatory stage of barbarism, a connection is thus formed between possession and strength, ownership and power, a prodigious display of commodities and a superior position of status. This meaning-connection becomes more developed in the feudal era, when brute valor is raised to the level of noble virtue and booty and trophies come to be prized as evidence of "preeminent force." Veblen leaves no doubt that this primitive mentality is alive and well in the modern mind: With the primitive barbarian, before the simple content of the notion has been obscured by its own ramifications and by a secondary growth of cognate ideas, "honorable" seems to con- note nothing else than assertion of superior force. "Honorable" is "formidable"; "worthy" is "prepotent." An honorific act is in the last analysis little if anything else than a recognized suc- cessful act of aggression; and where aggression means conflict with men and beasts, the activity which comes to be especially and primarily honorable is the assertion of the strong hand. The naive, archaic habit of construing all manifestations of force in</page><page sequence="12">MARX AND VEBLEN 365 terms of personality or "will power" greatly fortifies this conven- tional exaltation of the strong hand. Honorific epithets, in vogue among barbarian tribes as well as among peoples of a more advanced culture, commonly bear the stamp of this un- sophisticated sense of honor. Epithets and titles used in address- ing chieftains, and in the propitiation of kings and gods, very commonly impute a propensity for overbearing violence and an irresistible devastating force to the person who is to be pro- pitiated. This holds true to an extent also in the more civilized communities of the present day. The predilection shown for heraldic devices for the more rapacious beasts and birds of prey goes to enforce the same view. Under this common-sense barbarian appreciation of worth and honor, the taking of life - the killing of formidable competi- tors, whether brute or human - is honorable in the highest de- gree. And this office of slaughter, as an expression of the slayer's prepotence, casts a glamor of worth over every act of slaughter and over all the tools and accessories of the act. Arms are honorable, and the use of them, even in seeking the life of the meanest creatures of the fields, becomes a honorific em- ployment. At the same time, employment in industry becomes correspondingly odious, and, in the common-sense apprehen- sion, the handling of the tools and implements of industry falls beneath the dignity of able-bodied men. Labor becomes irk- some.23 There is, of course, an excess of hyperbole in this passage from the Leisure Class. Yet it serves to indicate that man does not look upon external objects as reified things but as symbols representing something else. The fetishism of commodities lies in their prestige-value, in their ability as "signs" to com- mand respect, authority, deference. In a world governed by symbols and sign-values, it suffices that one can appear to be powerful and successful by acquiring the commodities that convey those human attributes. It is precisely because com- modities radiate a "quasi-personal fringe" that Veblen cannot regard them as Marx's disembodied abstractions. Commodities are rich with human meaning, but that meaning exists solely in the mind of the interpreter. What is alienating, then, is not the fetishism in commodities but the animism in man which 23 Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class, pp. 30-31.</page><page sequence="13">366 SOCIAL RESEARCH compels him to impute personal and individual qualities to observed phenomena. Veblen was convinced that this behavior, rather than being peculiar to modern capitalism alone, had its origins in primi- tive communities where perception is a matter of "folk- psychology, not of mechanical fact." This anthropomorphic habit of conceiving phenomena in personal terms also impels the mind to project will onto matter: "All obvious manifestations of force are apprehended as expressions of conation - effort put forth for a purpose by some agency similar to the human will. The point of view of the archaic culture is that of force- ful, pervading personality, whose unfolding life is the substan- tial fact held in view in every relation into which men of things enter." The tendency to see inanimate things in animate terms, to endow inert matter with anthropomorphic qualities, prevails "pretty much universally" in archaic cultures, and it reinforces "the apprehension of phenomena in terms generi- cally identical with the terms of personality and individual- ity."24 In Veblen's analysis reification could not possibly reflect the lifeless state of commodities, their chilling "thinghood" which renders their behavior seemingly autonomous and beyond man's grasp. Rather, reification occurs when "external objects are in great part apperceived in respect of what they will do; and their most substantial characteristic therefore, their inti- mate individual nature, in so far as they are conceived as individual entities, is that they will do things."25 That the commodity, whether it be a captured canoe or a purchased Cadillac, "will do things" for a man that he cannot do for him- self, that it will give him the power and prestige that society denies him, that it will enable him to become that which he is not - this pathos is for Veblen the psychological meaning of reification. 24 Veblen, "Beginnings of Ownership," in Essays in our Changing Order, p. 35; and "Preconceptions," ibid., pp. 101-103. 25 Veblen, The Instinct of Workmanship, pp. 54-55.</page><page sequence="14">MARX AND VEBLEN 367 It should now be clear that Marx's commodity fetish and Veblen's animism are two aspects of the same behavior, the difference being that the former was determined to locate the origins of reification in the "laws" of political economy, while the latter perceived reification as characteristic of the collective mentality of predatory society in general. But Veblen also perceived another aspect of reification in the stratification of society based upon the possession of prestige symbols, and in the phenomenon of "emulation" he discovered why the com- modity fetish, instead of alienating man and producing social conflict, integrates man and produces social cohesion. Emulation and the Hegemony of Capitalism Veblen viewed emulation as an innate characteristic of man, but the nature and expression of that ambiguous natural endowment change in the course of history. In the early primitive cultures of small peaceable communities, there is little competitiveness and social discrimination, and what emulative spirit exists is directed toward those productive workers who contribute to the life of the community. But with the advance of tools, including weapons, some men can devote themselves to hunting large game and taking part in raids upon neighboring tribes. Now the activities of men come more and more to take on the character of exploit, and an "invidi- ous comparison" between the hunter/warrior and others grows continually easier and more habitual as the predators bring home tangible evidence of their superior prowess. Thus arises the distinction between "honorific employments" involving exploit and "humiliating employments" involving activities serviceable to the community. The accumulation of articles of wealth by methods other than toil represents man's attempt to identify with the superior class by possessing its symbols. Wealth has little to do with use-value, and even the consumption of goods is not directed toward the satisfaction of basic needs and comforts.</page><page sequence="15">368 SOCIAL RESEARCH The incentive to wealth, the familiar "profit motive" of politi- cal economy, is more a cultural trait than an economic truth: The motive that lies at the root of ownership is emulation; and the same motive of emulation continues active in the further development of the institutions to which it has given rise and in the development of all those features of the social structure which this institution of ownership touches. The possession of wealth confers honor; it is an invidious distinction.26 This motive increases as society becomes larger and more diffuse and mobile, creating a situation where it is difficult to appraise a person except by some external valuation, such as fancy dress, cultivated manners, or extravagant possessions. The irony is that emulation, though a primitive trait, does not vanish with the march of progress. For the greater the ad- vance in industry the greater will be the opportunity for com- parison, and hence the more intense will be the craving after the economic signs of social respectability. Moreover, status discrimination based on an "invidious comparison of persons in respect to worth, value, and potency" is, as in the case of inherited wealth and vested rights, "transmitted by descent from honorable antecedents." Thus economic success as a measure of approbation is an impression that grows stronger with each generation that inherits the belief.27 Veblen's theories of human behavior may have been out- rageous in Victorian America, but they were not alien to the thinkers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries - the very Enlightenment that he criticized for supposedly ignoring the social nature of man. Rousseau observed how "esteem" functions as the social motive for wealth, and in Rameau's Nephew Diderot offered perhaps the finest literary treatment of emulation and status anxiety as a form of alienation so acute as to disturb even Hegel from his metaphysical day- 26 Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class, p. 35. 27 Veblen, "Preconceptions," pp. 82-179.</page><page sequence="16">MARX AND VEBLEN 369 dreams.28 British social philosophers were no less keen on the relation of social pressures to economic behavior. Adam Smith advised that "the great secret of education is to direct vanity to proper objects," Bernard de Mandeville argued that "pride" was the particular "vice" from which flowed "public benefit," and even Hobbes realized that power could not be translated into authority without a modicum of social conscience among the citizenry. "There is no greater vexation of mind" than "scorn and contempt," wrote Hobbes, who was certain that "most men would rather lose their lives . . . than suffer slan- der."29 Perhaps the document in English political philosophy that most resembles Veblen's analysis is John Millar's The Ori- gin of the Distinction of Rank (1779), a discourse on the manners and customs of different stages of civilization that stresses the sociological determinants of wealth and consumption. In view of the above writings it must be said that the value of Veblen's contributions to social theory lies less in originality than in applicability. It is not Veblen's much-discussed "insights" that command our attention but the profounder implications he drew from them. Veblen was the first modern scholar to give economic behavior both a sociological content and an an- thropological basis, and in doing so he discovered two related problems in modern industrial civilization that remain with us like a post-Marxist incubus - the cultural hegemony of capitalism and the social stigma of labor. Veblen arrived at this discovery by viewing modern capitalism as a sociological phenomenon with anthropological 28 Jean-Jacques Rousseau, The Social Contract and Discourse on the Origin of Inequality , edited by Lester Crocker (New York: Washington Square Press, 1967), pp. 153-358; Denis Diderot, Rameau' s Nephew , translated by L.

As a result he wanted to broaden traditional eco- nomic investigation in order to comprehend behavior as a function of the social situation with roots in earlier cultures. In modern society, as in primitive communities, the concern for status can become such an obsession that the "pleasure-pain" assumptions of political economy seem rational in the ex- treme. Is the profit margin more important than the motives of pride, or even self-preservation more essential than status aspiration? Veblen, of course, did not state the case in such bald terms, but he could not resist refuting a serious principle by means of a satirical portrait: In persons of delicate sensibility, who have long been habituated to gentle manners, the sense of shamefulness of manual labor may become so strong that, at a critical juncture, it will even set aside the instinct of self-preservation. So, for instance, we are told of certain Polynesian chiefs, who, under the stress of good form, preferred to starve rather than carry their food to their mouths with their own hands. It is true, this conduct may have been due, at least in part, to an excessive sanctity or tabu attach- ing to the chiefs person. The tabu would have been communi- cated by the contact of his hands, and so would have made anything touched by him unfit for human food. But the tabu is itself a derivative of the unworthiness or moral incompatibility of labor; so that even when construed in this sense the conduct of the Polynesian chiefs is truer to the canon of honorific leisure than would at first appear. A better illustration, or at least a more unmistakable one, is afforded by a certain king of France, who is said to have lost his life through an excess of moral stamina in the observance of good form. In the absense of the functionary whose office it was to shift his master's seat, the king sat uncomplaining before the fire and suffered his royal person to be toasted beyond recovery. But in so doing he saved his Most Christian Majesty from menial contamination. Summun crede nefas animam praeferre pudori, Et pr opter vitam vivendi perdere causas.30 Veblen's humor should not detract us from the theoretical import of this passage. Veblen proved to be an early student *° Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class, pp. 45-46.</page><page sequence="18">MARX AND VEBLEN 371 of what came to be known in sociology as "role-playing." That men would carry out the social function of their class regard- less of consequences only indicates the extent to which that function shapes man's thoughts and actions. The completely socialized man whose entire life is absorbed by his social role is another example of how human consciousness can be lost to forces outside of itself, only now reification is not associated with commodities but with society itself. Reification operates in society by endowing ontological status to social roles.31 Man's identity, personality, and selfhood are achieved through the fulfillment of a role that is detached from human intentional- ity, preformed by institutions, class-systems, and cultural habits. Men in society do not have lives, they have only social functions, and their functions are lived out through mere mimetic repetitions of the prototypical actions embodied in the roles. "Manners," wrote Veblen, ". . . are in part an elab- oration of gesture, and in part they are symbolic and conven- tionalized survivals representing former acts of dominion or of personal service or of personal contact. In large part they are an expression of the relation of status - a symbolic pan- tomime of mastery on the one hand and of subservience on the other."32 Veblen's sensitivity to the social foundations of economic activity has many ramifications - consumer behavior, the vicis- situdes of fashion, the status of women, prestige systems based on conspicuous disutility, leisure values and the fate of work- manship, social conformity, the decline of the Protestant ethic, class stratification based on a non-Marxist criterion, a "meritocracy" without productive merit, the social compul- sions of slavery and domestic servitude, primitive exchange rituals and the modern commodity fetish, the drive for status, and numerous other ramifications that indicated for Veblen the triumph of "imbecile institutions" and that in our time 31 Peter Berger and Stanley Pullberg, "Reification and the Sociological Critique of Consciousness," History &amp; Theory 4 (1965): 196-211. 32 Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class, p. 48.</page><page sequence="19">372 SOCIAL RESEARCH suggest for Robert Merton the "latent functions" of manifest conduct.33 But the most important, because most overlooked, sociological aspect of Veblen's theory of emulation is its con- servative implications. Institutions are perpetuated by emula- tion, which is always directed upward as the mass of men continually adopt themselves to the culture and life-style of the classes immediately above them, thereby "internalizing" the norms of the establishment: The institutions of a leisure class have an effect not only upon social structure but also upon the individual character of the members of society. So soon as a given proclivity or a given point of view has won acceptance as an authoritative standard or norm of life it will react upon the character of the members of a society which has accepted it as a norm. It will to some extent shape their habits or thought and will exercise a selective surveil- lance over the development of men's aptitudes and inclina- tions.34 Because of the human propensity of emulation, the upper class is in a position to set a "prescriptive example of conspicu- ous waste" and to provide an "imperative example" of how the "canons of reputability" are established. Thus the norms that organize and provide cohesion to a society's value system originate at the top of the class structure and permeate down- ward, affecting (or "contaminating") the populations of the various strata below. It is for this reason that Veblen could not dismiss the "superstructure of society" - that layer of belief- systems which stands at the top of the social pyramid and represents presumably all the alienating ideologies of religion, nationalism, and capitalism - as a mere "reflection" of society's structural "base" that supposedly has its dynamic in the mode of production. The ideas of the leisure class may be as false as they are pernicious, but their power is as real as their influ- ence is ubiquitous. 33 Merton cited Veblen when he developed his theory of latent and manifest functions, noting that Veblen's gifts for observing the ironic and satiric dimensions of social life enabled him to perceive the ulterior intentions in ostensible conduct. See Robert K. Merton, Social Theory and Social Structure (New York: Free Press, 1968). 34 Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class, p. 145.</page><page sequence="20">MARX AND VEBLEN 373 In treating reigning cultural ideas as the unconscious foun- dations of social life, Veblen was anticipating an issue in social theory that would later be discovered by Antonio Gramsci - the phenomenon of hegemony. The problem of hegemony lies in explaining how a whole of society can come to be dominated by the values of a part, and why man therefore consents to his own domination by others, a phenomenon made all the more perplexing because it involves man's subju- gation to ideas rather than to power and coercion. In short, how does the ruling class legitimate itself if not by force? Veblen sensed that in a mass society the phenomenon of power, the ability to command by threat of coercion, gives way to the phenomenon of influence, the ability to persuade by the tendency of emulation. Veblen's shrewd analysis of the social determinants of economic behavior enabled him to see how emulation functioned to cushion the effects of alienation and exploitation, thereby integrating the worker into the culture of capitalism. Status Deprivation and the Integration of the Working Class Veblen addressed himself to the issue of the working class in "Some Neglected Points in the Theory of Socialism," pub- lished in 1892. The essay was written partly in response to the labor unrest of the early 1890s and partly in answer to Her- bert Spencer's severe criticisms of the socialist movement in America. Spencer had denounced socialism as a threat to competition and the system of free contract that allegedly had done so much to promote economic progress. Veblen, who had respected Spencer since his undergraduate days, assumed the role of the analyst as a way of countering the alarmist. Before fretting over the presumed dire consequences of socialism, advised Veblen, one should plumb the depths of the "chronic feeling of dissatisfaction" plaguing the laboring classes. Spencer's claim that the source of discontent lay in a</page><page sequence="21">374 SOCIAL RESEARCH feeling of "ennui" on the part of the workers may be one cause, Veblen acknowledged, but it is not the sufficient cause. Even less convincing was the Populist-Progressive contention that the economic system functioned to make the rich richer and the poor poorer, a sentiment that had, Veblen observed by noting the economic gains made by labor, only "the fascina- tion of an epigram." If the source of labor unrest lay neither in boredom nor in desperation, where may the cause of dis- content be found? Veblen answered this question by introducing an idea that would be developed more than a half-century later by social scientists, the idea of relative deprivation: "The existing system has not made, and does not tend to make, the industrious poor poorer as measured absolutely in means of livelihood; but it does tend to make them relatively poorer, in their own eyes, as measured in terms of comparative economic impor- tance, and, curious as it may seem at first sight, this is what seems to count." What workers feel is not physical but emo- tional privation, and this takes the "ignoble form of emula- tion," of striving after a "good name" and a reputable standing in the community. Suffering from status anxieties, workers direct their resentment toward the owners of private property "whose possessions rise above a certain rather indefinite aver- age. This feeling of injured injustice is not always distin- guished from envy; but it is, at any rate, a factor that works toward a leveling policy. With it goes a feeling of slighted manhood, which works in the same direction." 35 In Veblen's writings the American social order emerges as a class society without a class conflict. Without a well-developed sense of class consciousness, the worker came to envy and eventually adopt the life-style of the leisure class, believing that the meaning and value of life would not be found in production, as Marx and Veblen had hoped, but in consump- 35 Thorstein Veblen, "Some Neglected Points in the Theory of Socialism," in The Place of Science in Modern Civilization, pp. 387-408.</page><page sequence="22">MARX AND VEBLEN 375 tion according to the "pecuniary canons of taste." Desiring to climb up into the middle class, and influenced by the acquisi- tive and relatively idle culture of the nouveaux riches, the indus- trial worker suffered the indignity of "slighted manhood" the more he sought the elusive respect of those above him. Here we might find a clue to the problem that has troubled the Frankfurt scholars and other disenchanted Marxists: the seem- ingly willing collaboration of the working class in its own subordination. To the extent that the industrial worker com- pared himself to his image of people in a higher class, the worker conceded the right of that class to judge him. Was this behavior peculiar to only Veblen's American soci- ety? Perhaps. Yet such behavior may take on larger significance as the rest of the industrialized world becomes "Americanized." A dramatic case in point is Abudada, Kuwait, and other oil-producing countries of the Mideast, where one of the most important social and cultural consequences of instantaneous prosperity is the immediate importation of foreign workers. With sudden affluence, productive work be- comes more stigmatized than ever, and as the Cadillac replaces the camel, commodities take on the status of social icons. If the "barbarian status" of women (Veblen's phrase) remains the same, everyman becomes a sheik. Whatever the validity of Veblen's ideas for the rest of the world, studies by social historians of nineteenth- and twentieth-century America tend to confirm his observations, making him a prescient anatomist of what later would be called "the hidden wounds of class." That the American worker failed to become a radical social force cannot be ex- plained simply by pointing to prosperity and social mobility. The American worker was materially no better off than the German worker before World War I; and, as historians have discovered, while a measure of low-level mobility existed for the industrial workers, the social structure did not offer a widespread "rags-to-riches" ladder to success, the Alger myth</page><page sequence="23">376 SOCIAL RESEARCH so dear to business elites.36 Yet it is exceedingly difficult, given the paucity of historical data, to discover whether the workers believed in the myth of individualism because the modicum of social mobility did allow many workers to rise from the bottom of the ladder, even though not very far. Since workers' atti- tudes on this question are so crucial we are compelled to speculate. If, on the one hand, the workers remained skeptical of the myth, why did they fail to develop a radical class- conscious élan as a means of penetrating the false ideology? On the other hand, if they believed in the capitalist ideology of opportunity and mobility and yet failed to rise in occupation, income, and status, did they allow themselves to become inte- grated into the social order by turning their resentment against themselves, viewing their failure in terms of personal inadequacy rather than social inequity and thereby suffering individual guilt? Although data from the nineteenth century are silent on these questions, we do have evidence from the mid-twentieth century to indicate that as opportunity and mobility increase workers' attitudes become heavy with injured dignity and self-reproach. Whatever the source of this sentiment - religious, ethnic, psychological, etc. - the attitudes of workers are expressed in two curiously distinct ways. One sentiment, which was uncovered by Richard Sennet and Jonathan Cobb, shows the worker admiring the culture and character of the upper class, not so much because of its wealth as its superior inner resources. In contrast to the harsh, brutal, and often wild milieu of working-class life, marred by drunken brawls and family quarrels, upper-class life appears tame, quiet, gen- teel, "civilized" by a higher capacity for self-control. Even though the worker might despise the white-collar occupations of the banker and the salesman, he looks to their domestic culture as a "prestige model" that he wishes he and his family 36 Stephan Thernstrom, Proverty and Progress: Social Mobility in a Nineteenth Century City (New York: Atheneum, 1970).</page><page sequence="24">MARX AND VEBLEN 377 could emulate.37 We might call this a Weberian sentiment, inasmuch as the worker imputes superior qualities of inner restraint to the upper class. But there is another sentiment shared by the lower class that is closer to Veblen's observa- tions. This attitude turns up in Studs Terkel's interviews with workers from all walks of life. The following statement, by a Chicago steel worker, suggests Veblen's thesis about the deg- radation of manual labor in the eyes of the workers and their envy of the leisure class's freedoms and hedonistic life-styles: If I were to put you in front of a dock and I pulled up a skid in front of you with fifty-pound sacks of potatoes and there are fifty more skids just like it, and this is what you're gonna do all day, what would you think about - potatoes? Unless a guy's a nut, he never thinks about work or talks about it. Maybe about baseball or about getting drunk the other night or he got laid or didn't get laid. I'd say one out of a hundred will actually get excited about work. Why is it that the communists always say they're for the workingman, and as soon as they set up a country, you got guys singing to tractors? They're singing about how they love the factory. That's where I couldn't buy communism. It's the intel- lectuals' utopia, not mine. I cannot picture myself singing to a tractor. I just can't (Laughs.) Or singing to steel. (Sings song.) Oh whoop-dee-do, I'm at the bonderizer, oh how I love this heavy steel. No thanks. Never hoppen. Oh yeah, I daydream. I fantasize about a sexy blonde in Miami who's got my union dues. (Laughs.) I think of the head of the union the way I think of the head of my company. Living it up. I think of February in Miami. Warm weather, a place to lay in. When I hear a college kid say, "I'm oppressed," I don't believe him. You know what I'd like to do for one year? Live like a college kid. Just for one year. I'd love to. Wow! (Whispers) Wow! Sports car! Marijuana! (Laughs.) Wild, sexy broads. I'd love that, hell yes, I would.38 When comparing the studies of Sennet and Cobb on the one hand and Terkel on the other, we find that workers seem to 37 Jonathan Cobb and Richard Sennett, The Hidden Injuries of Class (New York: Random House, 1972); see also John H. Goldthorpe and others, The Affluent Worker in the Class Structure (London: Cambridge University Press, 1969). 38 Studs Terkel, Working (New York: Pantheon Books, 1974), pp. 5-6.</page><page sequence="25">378 SOCIAL RESEARCH entertain two differing views of the upper class. Some regard the wealthy as morally superior, others regard them as sensu- ally freer. However one might explain this dual attitude - and doubtless a Freudian could - the undeniable reality is that the American working class possesses little cultural autonomy. It looks outside of its own milieu, and generally above it, for discrete models of behavior. This is true not only for the culture of conduct but for the culture of work itself. One of the striking features of the nineteenth century American labor force was that many of its members were immigrants who arrived with little comprehension of and even less attraction to the imperatives and ethos of industrial labor. Yet peasants, farmers, skilled artisans, and casual day laborers were soon harnessed to new punctual and rigorous work habits, an effort that required considerable propaganda on the part of the business elites.39 The success of American business leaders in disciplining a potentially recalcitrant and unruly work force is further evidence not only of the power of capitalism but of its cultural hegemony. Conclusion: Technology versus Ideology The problem of hegemony, man's subjugation to ideas and not only to force alone, could very well be the future problem of bourgeois society. If so, it is necessary to add a further dimension to the somber speculations of Daniel Bell. The present "cultural contradictions" of capitalism do not derive only from the disjunction between its work ethic and its plea- sure principle. On the contrary, ever since the philosophy of property received its classical liberal formulation in the writ- ings of Locke, one may discern a central paradox: As labor is valued as a source of wealth, the laborer himself is regarded as cursed with the burden of work; the more the principle of 39 Herbert Gutman, Work, Culture, and Society in Industrializing America (New York: Knopf, 1976).</page><page sequence="26">MARX AND VEBLEN 379 labor is praised economically, the more the activity is dis- praised socially.40 It would be facile to dismiss such attitudes as an aspect of "alienation" or a species of "false consciousness." Indeed, Veblen's analysis suggests that the distinction between the fruits of labor and the acts of workmanship, between the esteem for the product and the disesteem of the producer, is reified thinking experienced as anthropomorphism, and that therefore alienation itself may have its roots in the sphere of consumption rather than production.41 In our age, when fewer and fewer people are engaged in industrial labor, and when technology and affluence have enabled more people to seek the "pursuit of happiness" in leisure activities, it would seem we need to turn our attention from the "productive forces" to the commodity culture, perhaps the true formative element in the modern development of popular consciousness. Veblen's writings may serve as a starting point for a study of the anthropomorphic ties which bind the "civilized" present to the "barbaric" past. Veblen's writings may also illuminate a new dimension in the contemporary debate between the consensus scholars and the conflict or coercion theorists of modern society. Represen- tatives of both schools are interested primarily in the Hobbes- ian question: Why does social order exist? In the consensus model, first articulated by Alexis de Tocqueville and in our time by Seymour Martin Lipset and Talcott Parsons, a society exists because the mass of citizens share common norms, ideas and beliefs, a value-system and structure of organizing princi- ples that function to hold together the social order. In the conflict school, first put forward systematically by Marx and in contemporary thought revised by non-Marxists like Ralf Dahrendorf, social phenomena are explained by either the interaction of class interests or the fluctuation of authority 40 E.

Hundert, "The Making of Homo Faber: John Locke Between Ideology and History," The Journal of the History of Ideas 33 (January- March 1972): 3-22. 41 A point I developed in "Animism and the Origins of Alienation: Veblen's An- thropological Perspective," History &amp;f Theory (forthcoming).</page><page sequence="27">380 SOCIAL RESEARCH relations, and hence the social system is perpetuated not by norms but by power. Veblen's position is similar to both schools of thought and yet distinct from each. The America he described at the turn of the century appears as a class society in which the workers suffered not so much from economic immiseration as status deprivation, a phenomenon that indicated the pervasiveness of the capitalist norms of pecuniary achievement. But it is also a society in which the values of the dominant industrial class prevail because of its prior success in the struggle for power. The captain of industry is admired for much the same reason that primitive man stood in awe of the warrior: he is "gifted with ferocity." The persistence of such attitudes is the result of both biological evolution and ideological coercion. "This ef- fect," wrote Veblen in reference to leisure-class hegemony, is wrought partly by a coercive, educational adaptation of the habits of all individuals, partly by a selective elimination of the unfit individuals and lines of descent. Such human material as does not lend itself to the methods of life imposed by the accepted scheme suffers more or less elimination as well as repression. The principles of pecuniary emulation and of indus- trial exemption have in this way been erected into canons of life, and have become coercive factors of some importance in the situation to which men have to adapt themselves.42 To Veblen the shifting movement and structure of power is the basis from which social attitudes evolve, and thereafter the ideas of the victorious class take on a life of their own and give modern capitalist ideology the same reified status that pre- vious ruling-class ideologies enjoyed in the past. In one respect Veblen offers a synthesis of the consensus-conflict debate: The history of society is the history of power struggles that issue in a culture of status worship, a cult of masculine triumph around which a consensus is formed and through which soci- ety itself is sustained. It is no coincidence that Veblen dis- cerned in capitalist ideology what other philosophers like 42 Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class, p. 145.</page><page sequence="28">MARX AND VEBLEN 381 George Santayana and Williams James saw as the curse of American culture itself: "the bitch-goddess of success." Had Veblen demonstrated nothing more than the authority which the strong acquire over the weak, he would have as- serted nothing more than a variation of nineteenth century social Darwinism. Yet by grounding his analysis in the an- thropomorphic nature of cultural phenomena, Veblen's ap- proach to attitude formation not only absorbed the distinction between norms and power that divide the consensus and con- flict theorists, it also called into question an assumption shared by liberals and Marxists as well as social Darwinists - the as- sumption of historical progress. Where the theorists of prog- ress saw change, he saw continuity; where they saw man's increasing rationality and mastery of the environment, he saw man acting out in symbolic forms of animistic behavior the residue of his barbaric nature; and where they looked to either "intelligence" or "class consciousness" to undermine the old order and produce a new society and perhaps even a "new man" (Trotsky's phrase), he looked to the "discipline of the machine" to liberate man from his archaic traits by restoring almost intact his productive, wholesome nature that had sup- posedly flourished in the early stage of "primitive savagery." Veblen's ultimate hope has always seemed "paradoxical" to intellectual historians.43 That the machine, a product of mod- ern man, could revitalize the healthy primal instincts of human nature does seem a dubious proposition. Yet seen in historical perspective, the liberating power of science and technology cannot be denied. What, after all, is more threaten- ing to false social distinctions than a "machine process" that makes no cultural distinctions? What is more revolutionary than an impersonal mode of cognition which has a logic and independent reality apart from the user? What is more demo- cratic than an empirical enterprise that has no higher obliga- 43 For example, David Noble, "The Theology of Thorstein Veblen," in Carlton C.

The problem is, as Lewis Mumford astutely observed, that in Western culture the ma- chine emerged purely as an "external instrument" for the conquest of the environment rather than as an extension of man's intellectual powers; and thus as modern life became more mechanized, and work dull and alienating, civilization assimilated the objects that technology brought forth rather than the "spirit" that had produced them. Mumford deserves to be quoted in full since he has expressed the Veblenean promise of the machine "aesthetic" more lucidly than Veblen himself: The possibility that technics had become a creative force, car- ried on by its own momentum, that it was rapidly ordering a new kind of environment and was producing a third estate mid- way between nature and the human arts, that it was not merely a quicker way of achieving old ends but an effective way oí ex- pressing new ends - the possibility in short that the machine furthered a new mode of living was far from the minds of those who actively promoted it. The industrialists and engineers themselves did not believe in the qualitative and cultural aspects of the machine. In their indifference to these aspects, they were just as far from appreciating the nature of the machine as were the Romantics: only what the Romantics, judging the machine from the standpoint of life, regarded as a defect the utilitarian boasted of as a virtue: for the latter the absence of art was an assurance of practicality. If the machine had really lacked cultural values, the Roman- tics would have been right, and their desire to seek these values, if need be, in a dead past would have been justified by the very desperateness of the case. But the interests in the factual and the practical, which the industrialists made the sole key to in- telligence, were only two in a whole series of new values that had been called into existence by the development of the new technics. Matters of fact and practice had usually in previous civilizations been treated with snobbish contempt by the leisured classes: as if the logical ordering of propositions were any nobler a technical feat than the articulation of machines. The interest in the practical was symptomatic of that wider and more intellig- ible world in which people had begun to live, a world in which the taboos of class and caste could no longer be considered as definitive in dealing with events and experiences. Capitalism</page><page sequence="30">MARX AND VEBLEN 383 and technics had both acted as a solvent of these clots of prej- udice and intellectual confusion; and they were thus at first important liberators of life.44 One senses that Marx would fully agree with Mumford's assessment of the liberating role of capitalism and technics. But what went wrong? How did the acquisitive culture of capitalism gain ascendancy over its rationalized system of production? Against the objectivity of the machine, why does the subjectivity of men continue to prevail? How did ideology come to triumph over technology? In Veblen's writings, where capitalism is not so much a definitive break with the past as a continuation, in modified form, of feudal status systems and barbarian survivals of prowess and esteem, we may find a compelling answer to this problem in contemporary social theory. 44 Lewis Mumford, Technics and Civilization (New York: Harcourt, Brace 8c World, 1963), pp. 322-323.
