Hines, Jr. Vice President for Departmental Affairs The College of Charleston Charleston, South Carolina 29401 Abstract An evolutionary perspective, which is cur- rently enjoying a revival in the social sciences, raises the possibility of a major transformation in the study of political development and modernization. It may be desirable to supplement (and in some instances re- place) the concept of "political development" with the concept of "political evolution." Political develop- ment may be likened to the biological process of ontogeny. It involves the construction of a viable set of political qua cybernetic processes and structures at any level of social organization, from wolf packs to human families to empires. Political evolution is an aspect of phytogeny. It involves the invention, elabo- ration, and diffusion of novel political forms of all kinds, only some of which may be more effective, or inclusive, or democratic, etc. Nor are all evolutionary changes necessarily "better" (i.e., more adaptive). Political development is concerned with problems of social engineering, while political evolution is con- cerned with architectonics?with the emergence of functionally significant political innovations. Political development is always situation-specific, while politi- cal evolution is also historical and may include changes that diffuse and become "species-wide." Political evolution is thus a dimension of the larger process of biological evolution. The emergence of political systems, which long predates the evolution of humankind, constitutes a set of adaptive strategies with significant evolutionary consequences. Political development and political evolution may go hand in hand, but this is not always the case. A particular polity may develop or decay independently of the larger process of political evolution. Among the many theoretical implications of this conceptual reformula- tion, we briefly address the impact on functionalist theory, modernization theory, social mobilization the- ory, political economy (positive theory), world sys- tems theory, dependency theory, and contemporary Marxist views. It is symptomatic of the conceptual and theoretical "muddle" that afflicts the field of political develop- ment (as depicted by Eckstein in a 1982 review) that most political scientists fail to draw a distinction between political development and political evolu- tion.2 For the most part, the term "evolution" is not even used by political scientists (except with refer- ence to Darwin's theory), and they seem unaware of the burgeoning literature?especially in anthropol- ogy but also in biopolitics?on the causal dynamics underlying the evolution of society in general and of politics and the state in particular. As a result, their vision of the political realm is severely truncated and their knowledge of pre-modern politics is sketchy at best.3 To make matters worse, the field of political development is currently in a state of considerable disarray. There is a lack of agreement even on first principles. As Huntington and Dominquez (1975) observed in their major review of the field, there has been an "alarming proliferation" of definitions and theoretical approaches over the years, yet little of it has been cumulative. Indeed, there does not even POLITICS AND THE LIFE SCIENCES. Vol. 6, No. 2, February 1988 ISSN 0730-9384. - 1988 by the Association for Politics and the Life Sciences.</page><page sequence="2">142 seem to be a consensus about two essential metatheoretical questions: What is political develop- ment? And how does one measure it? That is, how does one know when a polity is more or less developed? What rubric or measuring rod should be employed? Furthermore, Riggs (1981), an early and longtime contributor to the field of political development, has documented a sharp decline in the use of the term for the period 1968-1977. For Riggs, the concept of political development is best understood as an autonym (his neologism)?that is, a catchword, shib- boleth, or power-word "whose primary annotations are self-contained, apart from whatever denotations they might have" (Riggs, 1981:297). Migdal (1982), in a recent review of the field, sees evidence of "vigor" in the profusion of new ap- proaches that have appeared over the past several years, including most notably a historically chas- tened functionalism, various studies of political de- cay, crisis theory, dependency theory, world sys- tems theory, and neo-corporatist theory. But is this really a sign of progress? Or is it anarchy? Unfortu- nately, Migdal's review does little to dispel the impression of fragmentation at the core. He provides no guidance on how to achieve a synthesis, nor any means for choosing among the sometimes sharply conflicting visions. We are no closer to answering the fundamental metatheoretical questions than we were ten years ago. One is compelled to agree with Eckstein's (1982:452) judgment that the field of political development is "at a critical juncture." Accordingly, the time seems ripe for some fresh approaches. One reconstruction effort was under- taken by Eckstein himself, but here a very different approach will be taken?one that tacitly amends or contradicts some of Eckstein's views while agreeing with others. In essence, the approach proposed here involves a refocused version of a nineteenth century paradigm, which is currently enjoying a revival in the social sciences. We are referring to the evolutionary paradigm. Though an evolutionary perspective was widely employed by the social science pioneers, twentieth century social scientists have, by and large, adopted a historical or very truncated histori- cal perspective.4 (Prima facie evidence of this state of affairs is Nisbet's influential book, Social Change and History [1969], which admonishes social scien- tists to eschew evolutionism altogether.) Thus the reintroduction of an evolutionary perspective implies a radical departure from the dominant frame of reference in many areas of the social sciences, including especially political development theory. Defining Politics Let us begin by considering the perennial issue of how to define politics. Dahl (1970:8) has written that a definition is in essence a "proposed treaty... governing the use of terms." The treaty that is advocated here seeks to define politics as isomorphic with social cybernetics. This is a well- established approach. As Deutsch (1963) proposed many years ago, politics may be viewed as a "steering" process by which decisions are made with respect to "public" (common or intersecting) goals, as well as the process of communication (including feedback) and control by means of which relevant goal-oriented social behaviors are elicited (Easton, 1965; Corning, 1974, 1983; Steinbruner, 1974). In short, politics consists of goals, decisions, communications, and control?or cybernetic processes. The term "cybernetics" can be traced to the Greek word kybernetes, meaning steersman or helmsman and is also the root of such English words as governor and government. Thus, the "ship of state" metaphor reflects an etymological as well as conceptual affinity between cybernetics and politics. Furthermore, a full century before contemporary political scientists began applying the word to politi- cal phenomena, the French scientist Andr? Amp?re adopted the term "cybernetics" as a synonym for political science. We are following in that venerable tradition. In our view, this is the most value-neutral, inclusive, and widely acceptable definition. At the minimum, the cybernetic definition has the virtue of embracing and incorporating many of the more familiar textbook definitions of politics. It includes the allocation of values, relationships of influence and authority, the aggregation and development of power and a focus on public or collective problems. Coalitions and exchanges among participants are also distinctly implied. The major difference between the cybernetic defi- nition of politics and other common definitions has to do with the fact that politics qua cybernetics focuses on goals (whatever they may be) and the processes by which goals are established, pursued, and/or modified over time. In this definition, power, the struggle for power, conflict processes, and deci- sion making are all relevant, but they are not the essence of politics. They are subsidiary aspects. Furthermore, if a complex society is in reality an interconnected, hierarchically arrayed set of social systems, politics embraces not just what govern- ments do, but also the cybernetic dimension (or subsystem) of all goal-oriented social groups, how- ever small, however temporary, and however ephemeral they may be. Dahl writes; "Whether he likes it or not, virtually no one is completely beyond the reach of some kind of political system. A citizen encounters politics in the government of a country, town, school, church, business firm, trade union,</page><page sequence="3">143 club, political party, civic association, and a host of other organizations, from the United Nations to the PTA. Politics is one of the unavoidable facts of human existence. Everyone is involved in some fashion at some time in some kind of political system" (Dahl, 1970:1). Though Dahl is thinking in terms of his own definition, what he says also applies to the more inclusive cybernetic definition used here. One diag- nostic trait of a political qua cybernetic system is the presence of Dahl's "power, rule, or authority"? control over the behavior of the participants? whether in the form of consensual self-control, con- trol by authorities, or both. But a more important diagnostic trait is the presence of corporate goals. Not without reason have political theorists from Aristotle to Deutsch to Easton likened political sys- tems to the brain and nervous system of an organ- ism (and one might also include the sense organs, the endocrine system, and the musculature). Such anthropomorphism is not simply a literary device; political (cybernetic) systems play a functionally analogous decision-making and control role in what Spencer (1897[1874-1882] long ago characterized as "super-organisms". 5 Accordingly, the cybernetic definition of politics is imperialistic in that it suggests that there is much more to politics and political science than the work- ings of governments, political parties, lobbyists, and voters. If contemporary economists are engaged in doing analyses of the economics of family life, higher education, voting behavior, and office-seek- ing, the tables can be turned. Economic life?from markets to the Common Market?can be analyzed in political (cybernetic) terms, as many political scien- tists and other students of organizations are in fact doing, though not always with the cybernetic model explicitly in mind. Likewise, the domains of small- group theory and formal organization theory can be viewed as subspecies of a multidisciplinary political science. Wolin (1960) appreciated this in his discus- sion of "Organization and the Sublimation of Poli- tics" in Politics and Vision. The cybernetic definition of politics also has the virtue of encompassing analogous phenomena in other socially organized species, such as Apis mel- iifera (honeybees), Canus tupus (wolves), Pan troglo- dytes (chimpanzees), Panthera leo (lions), and Papio anubis (baboons). Goal-oriented decision making, communications, and behavioral control processes occur in all of these species and many others, and both the similarities and the differences among these species (and between them and human be- ings) are highly instructive. Indeed, the very univer- sality of cybernetic processes in socially organized species, however different in terms of the precise mechanisms and functions (the proximate causes), is of enormous theoretical importance, in our view. It suggests that politics is at heart a biological phe- nomenon, both a product of and a causal factor in the larger process of biological evolution. Equally important, this definition does not limit human politics, or political science, to what occurs in modern nation-states or "developing" countries. Politics qua social cybernetics can be found among the most primitive band-level societies, from the Semang to the Mbuti Pygmies, the Netsilik Eskimo, and in the archaeological and paleoanthropological residues concerning our remotest historical and prehistoric ancestors. Indeed, politics can be in- ferred even in the primeval, protohuman state of nature. The "social contract," emerged as a biologi- cal contract, or perhaps bioeconomic contract, among mating pairs, their offspring, and close kin. A division of labor and closely coordinated forms of social cooperation long predate the appearance of the human species (Corning, 1983). And at some point in the dim past which may never be identified with any real precision, systematic cooperation arose among unrelated individuals and groups, which opened the door to the virtually unlimited further "progressive" evolution of human societies. This evolutionary perspective on politics raises some profound questions. Why have political phe- nomena arisen in the course of human evolution? Why have there been apparent directional trends in the emergence of political processes and institu- tions over the past several hundred thousand years? What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for political systems to exist, and why do such systems persist and change? And what adaptive functions have political systems played in relation to the basic biological problem of survival and reproduction? These questions would seem to be fundamental to a theory of political "development." Yet a conscien- tious survey of the Handbook of Political Science, an important arbiter of what constitutes the subject matter of the discipline, reveals only oblique treat- ments of some of these issues. Consider this pronouncement in the Handbook (Smoke, 1975:247): "No purpose of government is more central than the protection of its citizens' physical security. Philosophically many thinkers have held that this, in fact, is the ultimate reason why humankind form governments. Empirically, all known governments have tried to do this.... The idea that government exists at least to protect the security of those who create and support it has everywhere remained axiomatic." This is a veiled assertion about the fundamentally determining role of a biological function that Smoke says underpins one of the axioms of political science. But if "govern- ment" refers to something that is generic and functional rather than institutional, then our best</page><page sequence="4">144 evidence indicates that government was also asso- ciated with the most rudimentary socioeconomic behaviors in our most remote protohominid ances- tors?hunting and gathering activities, care of the young, the making and deployment of primitive tools, the construction of crude shelters, the man- agement of fire, the domestication and herding of animals, primitive exchange patterns, migrations, and defense against predators of all kinds. Thus government is associated with any cooperative, survival-related activity in humans or animals. It very likely dates back several million years. None of this is even mentioned in the Handbook. Political Evolution What, then, is political evolution and how can it be distinguished from political development? An anal- ogy might be useful here. It can be said that political development is to political evolution as ontogeny is to phylogeny. Political development is a necessary concomitant of any goal-oriented social organiza- tion, in animals or humans, and it occurs whenever a viable organization comes into being. Political devel- opment involves the establishment of a cybernetic superstructure (processes of decision making, com- munications, and social control)?a superstructure which may be more or less transitory, more or less formal and institutionalized, and more or less effec- tive. Accordingly, Huntington's term "political de- cay" is the antithesis of development, insofar as Huntington employs that term with reference to a decline in the performance or functional efficiency of a political system (Huntington, 1965, 1968). 6 Political evolution, on the other hand, involves the invention, elaboration, and, possibly, diffusion of functionally significant political innovations of all kinds. Political development is concerned with prob- lems of social engineering, while political evolution is concerned with architectonics.7 Political develop- ment is always situation-specific, while political evo- lution is historical and, to varying degrees, universal. Thus, all viable polities develop. Some also evolve. To be more specific, political evolution may be said to occur (1) when a novel function (goal) is adopted and appropriate new political practices, mechanisms, or structures are created; (2) when a novel practice or structure is created to perform all or part of an existing function (e.g., when structural differentiation and functional specialization occurs); or (3) when there is "regression"?adaptive simplifi- cation or dissolution of an existing political practice or structure.8 It is important at this juncture to stress that evolution does not necessarily lead to better adaptation, or to some "higher" form. Evolution has no inherent direction, only "descent with [functional] modification" in Darwin's phrase. Unless we are much mistaken, the distinction we have drawn between political development and po- litical evolution cuts through one of the most perva- sive sources of confusion in political development theory. Political development involves the organiza- tional capabilities or capacities for achieving social goals, whatever they may be. It does not necessarily imply greater complexity, modernization, democratic institutions, or what have you. Political development in these terms refers only to the establishment of a cybernetic superstructure. It is consistent with the usages in organization theory, communications the- ory, and political anthropology. On the other hand, political evolution lies at the creative cutting edge where old problems are solved in new ways or new problems are grappled with and brought under cybernetic control. Thus, a regional agency such as the Port of New York Authority, which operates at a level between the states and the Federal government, was truly an evolutionary change in its time (even if we may not like the results) and so was the creation of the European Common Market. And so too would be the ultimate realization of an effective international ocean regime. (For a detailed case study, see Corning, 1969). On the other hand, the multiplication of state legislatures during the westward expansion of the United States and the establishment of various colonial governments by nineteenth century imperi- alist powers constituted both political development (at one level) and political evolution (at a higher level). Both processes occurred simultaneously. Moreover, innovations were introduced at both levels over time. By the same token, one can observe both developmental and evolutionary processes at work in the international political arena today, with the developing countries striving to create viable national institutions that are more or less closely modelled after existing patterns, even as historically novel processes of national and trans- national political evolution are occurring. This is not to say that the developing countries are perfect replicas of industrialized polities. To the contrary, the developing countries are invariably composites of unique cultural circumstances, elements bor- rowed from other cultures, and situation-specific political innovations of their own making?just like the so-called developed countries. Because many theorists have conflated develop- mental and evolutionary processes, there is often some confusion about exactly what it is a particular theorist is attempting to explain. For instance, while it is not possible to say that a given polity is under- evolved, it is possible to say that it is functionally underdeveloped, in the sense of not having the requisite institutional structures and functional capa-</page><page sequence="5">145 bilities for the achievement of its stated or tacit goals. Many precariously integrated developing coun- tries today would fall into the latter category. But consider also the case of the United States at the turn of the century. While it was more highly evolved than some European states of that time in terms of citizen participation, competitive parties, and other "feedback" processes, the U.S. was comparatively underdeveloped with respect to various regulatory and social welfare functions (and attendant organi- zational capabilities). Conversely, it may be said that some polities are overdeveloped: their governmental superstructures are more elaborate, and more controlling, than is warranted by the needs and objectives at hand, with possibly detrimental results. Such a condition might readily be ascribed to certain so-called command economies, though it could also be said that these countries are overdeveloped in some respects and underdeveloped in others. Opinions might be more divided concerning the issue of overdevelopment in some of the so-called post-industrial welfare states, such as the United States. But see the recent treatments of "system overload" and "red tape" in government (Kesselman, 1970; Crozier et al., 1975; Kaufman, 1977; Rose, 1980). On the other hand, it is permissible to say that an evolutionary change might be desirable, beneficial, or even a requisite for the achievement of a particu- lar goal. The prospective international regulation of ocean bed exploitation is a good example, but so was NASA and the U.S. space program, and so might be the creation of more effective international financial institutions. "Progress" and Political Evolution Is political evolution inherently "progressive?" To be consistent with modern evolutionary biology and (for the most part) evolutionary anthropology as well, political evolution cannot be assumed to be unidi- rectional or orthogenetic; there is no universal law of evolution, nor any certain path toward growth or progress (however it may be measured). Again, political evolution may be characterized in Darwinian terms simply as "descent with modification." That is, political evolution consists of functionally signifi- cant structural innovations over time in various political processes and institutions. However, it is also true that there have been a number of contingent trends in the course of soci- ocultural evolution, most notably toward (1) greater size (both population and territory), (2) greater orga- nizational complexity (i.e., structural and functional differentiation and concomitant mechanisms of inte- gration), (3) more levels of hierarchical control, and (4) greater capacity for the capture of, and control over, energy (human and exogenous). Moreover, these trends have had a strong tendency to "go together" (see Corning, 1983). Thus, it is perfectly legitimate to speak of evolution in relation to any or all of these contingent trends without implying that they are either necessary, inevitable, or desirable. In other words, evolution does not necessarily equate with "progress," however that may be defined. It is critical that our usage of the term evolution be understood clearly, because of the obvious linkages that have been drawn in the past between the idea of progress and the concept of evolution (Nisbet, 1969). Consistent with our usage, the U.S. Government was much more highly evolved in terms of size, complexity, and degree of control during World War II than in the immediate postwar years. During the war, eleven million men and women were under arms, tens of millions more were doing war-related work for the government, roughly 40 percent of a highly inflated and heavily taxed G.N.P. was devoted to the war effort in the peak year of 1944, and there was substantial home-front mobilization?from air- raid drills to the recycling of waste materials, food rationing, and war bond drives. (Total Government spending went from $6.0 billion in 1940 to $87.4 billion in 1944.) After the war, the U.S. experienced a substantial political "regression" (adaptive simplifi- cation), though much evolution in other directions (and for other reasons) has occurred since. Many functionally oriented writers on political development during the 1960s and 1970s, taking their cue from Almond's seminal formulation (Al- mond and Coleman, 1960), have also recognized some of the aforementioned trends. As Almond (1973:5) has observed: "The generic themes of cultural seculariztion, structural differentiation and specialization, and increasing capacity or perfor- mance ran through all of [these writings]." However, these writings almost invariably equated such trends with functional efficiency (as the reference to Almond suggests), that is, with development rather than evolution. Moreover, the world view of the development theorists was (and still is) confined to a very narrow segment of our evolutionary history. Some development theorists of a generation ago were also prone to equate development with politi- cal democracy. Though one might be able to make the argument that, all other things being equal, democratic political institutions and practices are on the whole more effective means for achieving vari- ous political goals and functions, this conclusion does not follow as a logical necessity?nor is it true in all cases (or for all political goals). The resort to "emergency government" in wartime is a case in point. The so-called Lincoln dictatorship at the out-</page><page sequence="6">146 set of the American Civil War, for example, was a rational and necessary response to the situation at hand, given Lincoln's objective of saving the Union (Rossiter, 1948). By the same token, when the cradle of modern democracy?Great Britain?enacted the restrictive Emergency Powers Act in World War II, it occurred in the context of a transcendent struggle for survival.9 Finally, it should be noted that political develop- ment and political evolution are processes that go on at all levels of human societies, ranging from the actions (and innovations) of individuals and local groups (for example, neighborhood crime patrols), to multinational corporations, national politics (e.g., Political Action Committees) and the emerging Euro- pean Parliament. Thus processes of political devel- opment and political evolution can be observed routinely, not only by specialists in interest groups, urban politics, American government, comparative politics, and international relations, but also by anthropologists, economists, sociologists, and man- agement scientists. Measuring Political Development and Evolution How, then, can we go about measuring political development and evolution? First, let us examine political development. As the term is employed here, it is strictly a functional concept and must be measured in functional terms?in terms of the capa- bilities for, and effectiveness in, achieving either formal or tacit social goals. Needless to say, there already exists a very large literature on this subject in the management sciences, public administration, economics, and comparative politics, among others (see the detailed review in Corning, 1983). Of course, political development can also be measured comparatively, or relative to some model, as many development theorists of a generation ago were in fact doing when they used the United States or other industrial countries as their standard for a developed country. Political evolution, on the other hand, can only be measured in relation to one or more contingent historical trends, such as those enumerated above. (The list above is not exhaustive, of course.) One may appropriately characterize (and compare) differ- ent polities (or the entire universe of evolving polities over time, for that matter) in terms of their size, organizational complexity, the number of levels of cybernetic control, their energy capture and control capabilities, etc. Historical changes in terms of any one or more of these criteria can rightly be called political evolution. (Again, see Corning, 1983.) Let us briefly apply this perspective to some prehistoric and historical data. The primitive bands of humans that populated the earth until about 15,000 years ago probably numbered less than 100, in most instances. They exhibited little specializa- tion of political roles and functions, probably en- joyed only two or two and one-half levels of political control (nuclear family, band and perhaps some loosely organized band clusters), and were able to control very little beyond the embodied energies of their adult members, along with some domesticated animals, and the use of fire. In contrast, a modern nation state like the United States consists of over 200 million people spanning an entire continent and more. The U.S. has an exceedingly complex political structure comprised of at least seven distinct levels (with some three million civilian employees at the Federal level alone), and deploys annually a sufficient amount of energy from all sources to equal the manpower of a popula- tion of 15 billion people. (Exogenous energy sources multiply the power of each of our citizens at least 75 times.) By any of the possible measures of evolution identified above, the United States may rightly be called more highly evolved than any pre-modern political entity, not to mention many contemporary nation states. However, this is not equivalent to being better adapted. It remains to be seen whether or not these evolutionary trends can be sustained, or whether the U.S. will even remain intact over the long run. Regressive evolution, adaptive simplifica- tion, even extinction are all theoretically possible within this framework. The Dynamics of Political Evolution In light of the foregoing, one of the challenges confronting the discipline of political science is to provide a satisfactory explanation for the causes of political evolution. How can we account for the sort of evolutionary trends described above? Some politi- cal scientists hold that no general theory of political evolution is possible, and that it is a pretentious affectation to believe that political history (and pre- history) can be reduced to some "formula." One could, after all, argue that every case is different, that there can be no generality amid the particulars of each historical situation. The alternative view is that, just as it is possible to reduce the dynamics of political life to certain common cybernetic elements, so too it is appropri- ate to reduce the underlying causal dynamics to a common denominator or, better said, to a unifying paradigm and causal process that can embrace the particulars of each case. There are certainly prece- dents for the use of such reductionism in attempting to explain historical processes. The concept of natural selection is an obvious example. The more important issue, though, is whether or not such an exercise is likely to be theoretically fruitful. Can further light be shed on the ongoing</page><page sequence="7">147 process of political evolution and the directional trends that have occurred over time? Is there an underlying pattern and logic to the process, or has it entailed only a cascade of random and fortuitous events? It is not our purpose to explicate such a theory here. (A theory of political evolution is devel- oped in detail in Corning, 1983.) Rather, our objec- tive is to elucidate the paradigm within which any general theory of political evolution must be embed- ded. Though political scientists have, for the most part, resisted threats to their disciplinary autonomy and have discouraged "fishing expeditions" by their colleagues into other disciplines, the fact remains that political processes are embedded in a much larger causal matrix that crosses a number of disci- plinary boundaries. For better or worse, the causes of social and political behavior are interdisciplinary in nature, and, as our understanding of the causal matrix continues to expand, the evidence accumu- lating across the life sciences and the social and behavioral sciences points increasingly toward an interactional paradigm. In essence, an interactional paradigm treats the dynamics of sociocultural evolution over time as being inherently configurai, multilevelled, and hierar- chical in nature. As Lasswell (1968:6) pointed out quite clearly, "... the comparative method as ap- plied has been insufficiently contextual, inade- quately problem-oriented, and unnecessarily restrict tive in technique. In brief, it has been insufficiently configurative." In reality, the evolutionary process has been co- determined by multilevelled structures of causal variables, ranging from genetic constraints and be- havioral biases (or what Lumsden and Wilson, 1981, call "epigenetic rules"), to our emergent biological needs and derivative psychobiological motivations, our cultural preadaptations (the contingencies of our previous evolutionary history), as well as the many situational factors (economic and political) that are familiar to political scientists. In addition, the evolu- tionary process is partially shaped by a variety of stochastic factors and physical constraints?what the Nobel Prize-winning geneticist Monod (1971) characterized as "chance and necessity" (see also Almond and Genco, 1977). In the current parlance, both "internal" causes (at various levels) and "external" causes are likely to exercise a co-determining influence on the actions of (and evolutionary changes in) any particular political system, including the actions that lead to "progres- sive" or "regressive" political evolution. As Russett (1982:19) observes: "We do find generalizations and regularities (in the behavior of nations), but they are complex, interactive, heavily conditioned. They show the importance of detailed country-specific knowledge...." Hence, the explanation for an important evolution- ary event like the Law of the Sea treaty, for example, must include the complex web of processes and changes occurring at lower levels (including ecologi- cal, demographic, technological, and economic), in addition to the interactions between nations as corporate entities and the dynamics of the negotia- tion process itself. And because the conclusion of such a treaty was an event that was embedded in a confluence of historical forces, it could not have happened even a generation earlier. Indeed, the stream of historical causation often confounds our efforts to identify regularities. What may seem to be a sufficient condition in one context may be quite ineffectual in another, because other necessary con- ditions that may have been in the background, or that were held constant, do not remain fixed over time. For example, the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand at Sarajevo was sufficient to trigger World War I, while the assassination of President Kennedy was not sufficient to trigger World War III. At present, these historical processes can be simulated only in a very crude way with systems dynamics models. However it may ultimately be possible to devise more complex, multilevelled cy- bernetic systems-within-ecosystems models that are able to incorporate the combined effects of chance, necessity, and "teleonomy" (or the evolved purpos- iveness of the human mind). This is the challenge that awaits the next generation of model builders. We should briefly elaborate on the concept of a "political ecosystem." A political ecosystem may be viewed as a functional analogue of the ecosystems that are found in nature. In effect, the concept of an ecosystem represents an alternative formulation to Waltz's (1975; 1979) concept of a political market. (Waltz applies his concept only to international politics, but it is also applicable to "lower" level political systems, to a degree.) Waltz argues that, if Realpolitik and balance of power theories capture the essentially "anarchic" and competitive nature of international politics (he defines the word anarchy carefully), these theories "fare badly" in predicting the course of events because they are too reduction- ist, for the most part. That is, they do not take sufficient account of the system in which each of the actors is embedded. By "system," Waltz does not mean that international politics consists of a single unified entity. It is not analogous to an organism (i.e., a cybernetic system) which is endowed with an overarching goal (or goals) and a functional division of labor. Instead, it is analogous to a "market." As Waltz points out, a market is viewed by economic theorists as a structure, or framework of forces with</page><page sequence="8">148 emergent properties that arise from the relationships and interactions among the actors. We will use Waltz's (1975:90) words here: The market arises out of the activities of separate units?the persons and firms?whose aims and efforts are directed not toward creating an order but rather toward fulfilling their own internally defined interests by whatever means they can muster. The individual unit acts for itself. From the coaction of like units emerges a structure that affects and constrains all of them. Once formed, a market becomes a force in itself, and a force that the constitutive units acting singly or in small numbers cannot control. Instead, in lesser or greater degree as market conditions vary, the creators become the creatures of the market that their activity gave rise to... [Thus], the market is a cause interposed between the economic actors and the results they produce. It conditions their calculations, their behaviors, and their interactions. It is not an agent in the sense of A being the agent that produces outcome X. Rather it is a structural cause. A market con- strains the units that comprise it from taking certain actions and disposes them toward taking others. Up to this point, we second Waltz's line of reason- ing. A chief difficulty with various so-called systems theories of politics, such Kaplan's (1957), is that they fail to make a clear distinction between the two fundamentally different kinds of systems that are found in the political realm, which routinely interact with each other. Waltz calls them "firms" and "mar- kets," but we would call them cybernetic systems and ecosystems. We differ from Waltz in that we advocate the use of the biological cum ecological model, in lieu of the economic model. The difference is, we believe, significant.10 Though the market model is certainly more famil- iar to social scientists, in point of fact the organism- within-ecosystem?or ecological community- model provides a far richer and more precise anal- ogy with the actual behavior of both economic systems and political systems. First, the market model defines too narrowly the goals of the actors. Neither in politics nor in economic life do the actors single-mindedly pursue only "power," or "profits." Nor are "buying," "selling," and "exchanges" the only transactions that occur. At the minimum, orga- nized polities pursue their biological survival? which, on reflection, is not a simple goal. There is no such thing as "mere" survival. Survival is always a continuing and multifaceted challenge (Corning, 1975, 1983; Hines, 1981). To be sure, the actors may also pursue a wide variety of goals that are instru- mentally related to such things as the growth, power, and prestige of the polity or organization. But these goals are also indirectly related to the underly- ing survival problem. When one begins to probe the motivations behind it, even the profit motive turns out to be complex, and is often directly related to survival. Second, neither in politics nor in economic life do the actors pursue their goals only by "struggle" or "competition." They do so by a variety of means and with a variety of relationships to other actors. Be- sides competition, there are such ecological ana- logues as competitive exclusion, pr?dation, parasit- ism, reciprocity, mutualistic symbiosis, niche partitioning, ecological specialization, and multifari- ous forms of inadvertent ecological interdependency (Odum and Odum, [1953] 1971; Wilson, 1975; Pi- anka, 1978). There is even occasional altruism. Third, and perhaps most important, political and economic activities are, in the aggregate, related to each other and to the biological problem of survival and reproduction for human populations. Indeed, our political and economic systems also interact with natural ecosystems and affect them to such a degree that environmental problems are now a major agenda item in both domestic and interna- tional politics (Sprout and Sprout, 1965, 1968; Ophuls, 1977; Pirages, 1978). (Indeed, the field of "political ecology" awaits further development.)11 Why do polities develop, and evolve? In essence, because of historically determined, situation-specific opportunities for achieving "functional synergism" (functionally important cooperative effects) in rela- tion to specific internal and/or external social goals. (For a detailed discussion of this theory, see Corn- ing, 1983.) In macro-level polities these goals are generally (though not always) derived from human needs that are related directly or indirectly to the survival and continuity of the polity and its mem- bers. However, the causal dynamic requires a link- age between opportunities, specific goals and con- crete actions. The opportunities for development/ evolution arise out of the specific, historical context, but politics (in the sense used here) co-determines the outcomes. The Roman Empire was built with a combination of natural resources, a strong agricul- tural base, a technically superior crafts industry, opportunities for economical shipborne commerce around the rim of the Mediterranean, siege-engines and military phalanxes armed with iron swords, shields and body armor, horse-drawn chariots and wagons, good roads, aquaducts, writing and record keeping, legal and was not the result of a pre- ordained plan but a piecemeal, "organic" growth process?a favorable tide that spanned several cen- turies. Likewise, the nation states that emerged in Europe from the sixteenth century forward were favored by complex combinations of ecological, technological, economic, socio-political, and military factors. Take away any major element?for example, artillery?and Europe might have remained a frag-</page><page sequence="9">149 mented patchwork of warring feudal baronies that were protected, ultimately, by impregnable for- tresses (Andreski, 1968). Such evolutionary changes in turn create new needs and new opportunities. It is an endless process. From Shakespeare to Arthur Schlesinger, Sr. and Karl Deutsch, historically minded observers have often used the metaphor of the ocean tides to express a view that is very similar to the process of sociocultural and political evolution that we have sketched above. The sea changes that have often redirected the voyage of humankind have occurred when historical opportunities were "taken at the flood."12 The precise configuration of factors is always unique, to be sure, but functional synergism and correlative, co-determining (cybernetic) processes are the underlying constants. Political Development Revisited How does the evolutionary paradigm and the pro- cess of evolutionary change that we have described above, square with the literature in political develop- ment theory? Though a detailed review and critique is obviously not possible here, some general com- ments are in order. First let us consider the structural-functionalist school. The core assumption of these theorists is that political development is a functional requisite for any organized society, and that political develop- ment (in the sense of evolution) must go hand in hand with economic evolution. Though there are many variations of emphasis, most of these theorists endorse the view that "structural differentiation" and increased organizational "complexity" are somehow central to the evolutionary process, al- though Almond and Powell (1978) have also stressed what they call the "secularization" of the "political culture." As they put it in the 1978 edition of their well-known text: A structurally differentiated political system with a secularized political culture will have increased capability to shape its domestic and international environments, (p. 20) Accordingly they hypothesize that: Development results when the existing structure and culture of the political system are unable to cope with the problem or challenge without further structural differentiation and cultural sec- ularization. Or, as La Palombara (1963:41) put it: As a general rule, specialization and differentia- tion of political roles and structure will be accom- panied by similar differentiation and specializa- tion in other sectors of society as well. An important variant of this perspective can be found in the work of Huntington (1965). Huntington begins by quoting de Tocqueville: "Among the laws that rule human societies, there is one which seems to be more precise and clear than all others. If men are to remain civilized or to become so, the art of associating together must grow and improve in the same ratio as the equality of conditions is in- creased." Huntington thus seems to be endorsing a func- tionalist justification of democracy. Yet, he goes on to characterize development as the "institutionaliza- tion" of specialized "structures" and "procedures." For instance, he quotes approvingly Pye's statement that the "ultimate test" of political development is "the capacity of a people to establish and maintain large, complex but flexible organizational forms" (Huntington, 1965:415). The impression is left that democracy and political development (meaning structural differentiation) are somehow closely linked. The confounding of our distinction between devel- opment and evolution is clearly evident in these propositions. But more important, the propositions are arguable. More differentiated systems may not necessarily be more adequate to their environments, and they are certainly not the "ultimate test" of anything. Nor are they inextricably linked to demo- cratic institutions.13 By the same token, it is not the case that the evolution of a more complex system occurs only when an existing structure is insufficient to "cope" with a problem. It may occur simply because somebody thought up a more efficient, or more economical, way of getting a job done, or because an opportunity presented itself to do some- thing new (viz., NASA and the U.S. space program). Nor is it clear that "secularization" is an essential ingredient. Traditional cultures and institutions may in fact play a key role in the process; political evolution may combine both old and new cultural elements, as was certainly the case in England, Japan, and elsewhere (Eisenstadt, 1972). Likewise, La Palombara's wording suggests (per- haps unwittingly) that "complexification" is the prime mover, the precipitator of correlative structural changes in society. This is the opposite of the view, associated with the classical Marxists and some of the so-called cultural materialists, that politics is epiphenomenal, a mere reflection of more basic material and social forces. In fact, the evidence suggests that the evolutionary process has been a two-way street, that reciprocal and interactive cau- sation has been the norm (Corning, 1983). Finally, there is no inherent superiority associated with organizations or polities that are larger in size, or more complexly structured, or more democratic. The benefits of these progressive trends are always</page><page sequence="10">150 dependent on the context and the goals at hand, not to mention how well-developed (i.e., efficiently orga- nized and operated) the system may be. General Motors is not inherently superior to Honda, even though GM is larger. China is larger in population by far than the U.S., but it is not militarily or technologi- cally superior. Nor has Russia's top-heavy bureau- cracy guaranteed technological or economic preemi- nence for that country. In retrospect, many of the early developmental theorists were energized by the problem of "mod- ernization"?the problem of diffusing to the develop- ing countries the adaptive strategies that had been pursued successfully by Western countries. By and large, this chauvinism was well-intentioned. After all, if modernization seemed to be associated with a longer life-span, better health, greater economic security, and more political independence and sta- bility, and if Third World leaders themselves aspired to emulate the industrialized West, who could wish them any less? But, in light of the perspective explicated above, the assumption that Third World countries could easily recapitulate the phylogeny of Western socie- ties (or that the Western pattern would prove to be desirable, much less stable over the long haul) was naive; it displayed a lack of appreciation for the enormously complex, synergistic, and historically unique nature of the evolutionary process generally, and of each particular cultural entity. In many of these countries, it is now clear, neither the internal nor the external context was propitious for such mimicry to occur, at least not without a long and painful transition process (Hines, 1978). Indeed, some Third World efforts to ape industrial societies have had disastrous results. (Brazil's Amazon devel- opment project is an example.) Nevertheless, the functionalist perspective is fun- damentally sound. Political development/evolution is predominately a functional process with functional causes and functional consequences. Moreover, a functionalist perspective need not be Western-ori- ented, static, equilibrium-oriented, or politically con- servative. It is important to look beneath the some- times flawed interpretations of particular theorists to appreciate the underlying validity of the functionalist perspective. (Indeed, it is well to remember that Darwin's theory of biological evolution is, in fact, a functionalist theory of change.) Brief mention should also be made of the ap- proach to political development (evolution) that em- phasizes various social process variables, or, to be precise, various aggregate indicators that are pre- sumed to "stand for" social processes. For instance, Lerner (1958:46) postulated that "urbanization" leads to increased literacy, which leads to increased media exposure, which has generally "gone with" greater participation in the economy (per capita income) and greater participation in the political system (voting).14 He found that urbanization data "explained" 67 percent of the variation in voting rates among 54 nations. This hypothesis was subse- quently supported in a general way by the work of three other researchers, using somewhat different data bases and more complex causal models: Ou- tright (1963:253-264) with 77 nations; Alker (1966) with 85 nations; and Rummel (1972) with 82 nations. Particularly striking was Cutright's findings that the degree to which mass communications processes are developed is a good predictor of political devel- opment.15 Perhaps the most important social process theory of political development (evolution) is Deutsch's (1961) "social mobilization" hypothesis. As Deutsch defined it, the term social mobilization refers to a complex, interconnected cluster of personal changes?changes away from a prior pattern of residence, occupation, social group membership, institutional roles, and even personal values and loyalties, and toward a new pattern. Deutsch hy- pothesized that these patterns tend to "go to- gether" and that they also undergo systematic shifts, in conjunction with economic development (evolution). Indeed, he suggested that the causal relationship between these two aspects of moderni- zation are reciprocal over a longer time frame (see also Lerner, 1958; and Tilly, 1978). To measure such processes, Deutsch proposed using various indices that could be tracked in a time series to observe changes, e.g., the percentage of the population that is urbanized, the percentage of the work force in nonagricultural occupations, liter- acy rates, rates of mass media participation (com- munications). What is particularly striking about Deutsch's indicators is that, based on the rates of change that he observed for nineteen selected countries during the mid-1950s, his predictions for the future were very close to the actual results observed for 1960 and 1970, as reported in a later reprint of his original paper (Deutsch, 1979). There does, indeed, seem to be a close relationship be- tween economic development (evolution) as mea- sured by various aggregate indicators and a cluster of related social changes that can be measured in a similar fashion. (For a more detailed review of the relevant evidence, see Corning, 1983). On the other hand, there is a serious problem associated with attempting to develop causal mod- els of political evolution in which something called "urbanization" is said to be a prime mover. It begs a further question. What causes urbanization? In fact, urbanization is not a monolithic force of some sort but the product of enormously complex ecological, economic, social, and political processes. It may</page><page sequence="11">151 well be that urbanization is correlated with political development or democratic participation. It may be true that urban development and political develop- ment go together. But an examination of some specific cases quickly undermines simplistic causal arguments. To cite one example: during the past 100 years, both Japan and Egypt have experienced tremendous urban growth. One cannot say, though, that these two countries have achieved equivalent levels of economic or political development, any more than one can discern in the explosive growth in recent decades of urban agglomerations such as Calcutta any concomitant development of the Indian polity. By the same token, it should be stressed that democratic political practices did not originate in modern urban societies. Democracy was practiced (albeit with a limited franchise) in pre-Socratic Greece, in Republican Rome, in the Iroquois Confed- eracy, and in the United States of 1800, when 94 percent of the population inhabited rural areas. Such cases have generally been treated by devel- opment theorists as deviants that lower the probabilities, rather than as falsifiers that should raise doubts about the nature of their variables and their reasoning about the sources of causation. However, the recent development of systems dy- namics models has introduced a new level of sophis- tication into our theorizing about such matters. We can now go beyond correlation analyses, linear regression analyses, or even path analyses, and construct models that incorporate many dynamically interacting variables in goal-oriented, feedback-con- trolled systems. (A landmark venture in the use of systems analysis for studying political development is Brunner and Brewer's [1971] volume in which the effects of some twenty-two different variables were analyzed in relation to the process of political devel- opment in Turkey and the Philippines over a twenty year period.) To the extent that Deutsch's useful concept of social mobilization is treated as a distinct social fact with causal potency, one must view it skeptically. For one thing, some of the very same phenomena that Deutsch and others would include in this term can also be associated, not with democratization, but with disorder and "decay" (as Huntington and Dominquez point out). Likewise, the sometimes pos- itive role of tradition and cultural continuity in the development process may be underrated in such formulations (Eisenstadt, 1973). But most important, there may be something gratuitous about the entire concept. All changes of social affiliation involve leaving something behind and going to something else. They occur when young male baboons leave their natal troops to join other troops or to establish troops of their own; they occur in patrilocal band societies when the bride leaves her own kin group to take up residence with her husband's family; they occur also when a mod- ern executive switches jobs; indeed, they occur whenever anyone actively joins any organization. Furthermore, it has become increasingly evident in recent years that "modern" societies may, in reality, be built up from only partially "mobilized" hierar- chies of kinship networks, tribal associations, reli- gious sects, and ethnic minorities that may never become completely assimilated into the larger melt- ing pot. To what extent, then, is it valid to reify social mobilization and treat it as a distinct intermediate process that can be separated from the economic and political forces which directly motivate and impel such cultural changes? Is social mobilization a distinct syndrome with independent causal potency, or is it merely the abstraction of various social concomitants of political development? (Are we measuring correlated effects of causal relationships, in other words?) It is significant that Deutsch does not attempt to measure social mobilization directly. As noted above, he relies on such global indicators as urbanization, the number of radio listeners, and literacy rates. In sum, practitioners of the sociological approach to political development, relying as they do on Durkheimian "social facts" and aggregate statistics, may have been converting indirect measures of enormously complex, systemic processes into global causes. We should also briefly mention the relationship between political evolution as a macro-level, sys- temic phenomenon and various micro-level ap- proaches to political theory, including especially positive theory. It has long been customary for social scientists to focus their efforts either on the micro- or the macro-level and to make little or no effort to relate their work to the concerns of theorists working at other levels. Indeed, many theorists take the position that micro- and macro-level theories are mutually exclusive and necessarily in competition with one another. Thus, for instance, Riker and Ordeshook (1973:35) deny the need for considering the properties of any collectivity independently of the actions of its parts: "We reject the necessity for organic concepts...." While they concede that the properties of water are different from those of its constituent atoms, they claim that "to utter general (theoretical) sentences about the chemical properties of this com- pound. .. requires only that we know that it is com- posed of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen." This is a serious misconception. Water has an array of emergent combinatorial (synergistic) proper- ties that cannot be derived from an understanding of</page><page sequence="12">152 the constituent elements alone. These properties can be understood only by studying the interactions among the parts and whole?water itself. And if, as we maintain, such wholes have independent causal potency in sociocultural evolution, then they require their own theoretical sentences. An understanding of the parts may not tell us why the whole exists or what effects the whole will produce (Hines, 1979). Up to this point in the discussion we have been focusing mainly on systemic issues, on complex systems and how these are related to the process of sociocultural evolution. Now, however, we must fo- cus on the problem of accounting for political sys- tems in terms of individual choices, or to be more specific, in terms of the rationality assumption of positive theory. What is needed is a theory that can bridge the gap by being able to account satisfacto- rily for both systemic phenomena and the choices and actions of individual actors. A fully satisfactory theory of sociocultural and political evolution must be able to speak to the different kinds of "why" questions that concern both micro- and macro-level theorists. In brief, our argument is that the synergistic effects produced by systems of various kinds are the common denominator, the functional basis for various forms of individual cooperative behaviors (see Corning, 1983). In essence, the synergistic effects that are produced by cooperative social action provide the necessary positive incentives for individual choices. The ultimate answer to the "why" question is provided by specific historical opportunities for achieving synergies, while the as- sumptions embedded in various rational choice models specify the motivational constraints and facilitators that may be present in different circum- stances. At best, then, the various micro-level principles and models can be only partially explanatory. They can answer only certain co-determining motivational questions relating to how different individual actors will respond to various opportunities. The micro-level models can enable us to specify the contexts within which opportunities for realizing synergies may be transformed into decisions and actions. But the functional processes that create these opportunities in the first place must be specified separately. In other words, both micro- and macro-level explana- tions are necessary, but neither is sufficient. Finally, a few comments are in order with regard to World Systems Theory and Dependency Theory (Wallerstein, 1974; 1980; Santos, 1970; Chase-Dunn, 1975; Kaufmann et al., 1975; Duval, 1978; Cardoso and Faletto, 1979; Evans, 1979; Russett, 1982), and to contemporary Marxist critiques of the former. Though the theorists of the World Systems and Dependency persuasions focus their attention on different time periods, both schools are concerned with the role of external forces in shaping the internal structures and external relations of different societies. The tendency among these theorists to present strongly partisan analyses has been noted by others (Packenham, 1978; Zolberg, 1981). However, this is not to deny the partial validity of their views. Indeed, few political scientists would disagree with the general proposition that external relationships?the interactions among societies?have been of very great importance historically; there is much direct historical evidence (not to mention the extensive evidence in archaeology and ethnography). Very few societies have enjoyed the luxury of complete isola- tion from outside influences during the last few hundred years at least. (The political evolution of the United States, after all, was significantly affected by European influences?cultural, economic, political, and even demographic). What is in contention among the proponents and critics of Dependency Theory is the degree to which external influences in the form of economic exploita- tion (and its political correlates) may determine the economic and political fate of smaller, weaker and/ or less industrial countries. The debate concerns how much and what kind of influence various exoge- nous variables have had over the processes of societal development and evolution and what the benefit-cost ratios have been for the various actors. Dependency theorists see the developing states as being at the mercy of forces beyond their control, and as victims. Likewise, World Systems theorists see the evolution of the global system of nation states since the sixteenth century as having been driven by the forces of capitalist acquisition and exploitation. To observers of this debate, it would seem that the influence of various externalities should be treated as an open, empirical question that only careful, objective, multilevelled analyses can an- swer. It is likely, however, that the truth will lie somewhere in the middle, and that the process of societal (and global) development and evolution will prove to be much too complex and multifaceted to be compressed into any "prime mover" theory. It is far more likely that an intricate combination of various internal factors (ecological, demographic, economic, and political) and various external factors acting together synergistically have shaped the directional trends that have occurred. Accordingly, the relative poverty of a given Third World nation may be attributable in part to the influence of external agents. At the same time, it may also be due in part to such factors as the rapid growth of its population, the depletion or lack of critical re- sources, or an unfavorable ecological setting. In-</page><page sequence="13">153 deed, internal and external forces may reciprocally affect one another. Consider a classic example?the Irish potato fam ine in the nineteenth century (Woodham-Smith, 1962). British conquest and imperial domination, including especially the expropriation by wealthy British citizens of large tracts of Irish land, played a major role in reducing the population to bare subsis- tence levels. The shortage of arable land and the need for the peasants to use intensive production methods in order to eke out a living from tiny garden plots, led also to the introduction of potatoes and their widespread adoption as a staple crop. Never- theless, these factors were not sufficient to produce the disaster that occurred. Explosive population growth was another major contributing factor and so, of course, was the potato blight, a totally unex- pected ecological occurrence. In short, the potato famine was the product of negative synergy. It involved a nexus of unfavorable factors (including some that we have not even mentioned), any one of which would otherwise have been insufficient by itself to produce one of history's great calamities.16 In recent years, some Marxist analysts, mired in a debate over the capitalist development (un- derdevelopment) of Third World countries, have challenged the perspectives of World Systems The- ory and Dependency Theory, arguing in general that the role of the state in national and subnational political development and evolution has been under- estimated. Too much emphasis, they claim, has been placed on exogenous or external variables (Chilcote, 1982; Palma, 1978). Non-Marxists as well have attempted to show that society-centered expla- nations fail to appreciate the autonomy of the state as an independent variable: "The possibility that the state's preferences have at least as much impact upon public policy as do society's is ignored; the state's having certain distinctive interests and diver- gent preferences is not considered; the state's many autonomous actions are not calculated; the state's numerous autonomy-enhancing capacities and op- portunities are not examined; and most fundamen- tally, the failure to differentiate state and society eliminates the possibility of validating or invalidating the societal constraint assumptions." One need only substitute "world system" for "society" to extend Nordlinger's point and apply it to the World Systems and Dependency theorists. A more substantive critique of Dependency The- ory has been provided by Friedman (1984:3), who used Peru and Argentina as examples to show how the state contributed to "the creation of Spanish American agro/mineral export growth and political stability." In other words, the political development/ evolution of the state and its many instrumentalities, as well as its impact on society, must also be a part of our explanatory apparatus, just as much as class conflicts and the global economy. As Friedman (1984:199) concludes: In both Peru and Argentina, State policies aimed at strengthening the State and creating political and social order laid the foundation for the development of the export economies of the late nineteenth century. In a recent review of the debate between different schools of thought on political development, Higgott (1983) argues that there has been a distinct shift toward a more policy-oriented approach to develop- ment studies, one that emphasizes the importance of state-initiated strategies. Higgott concludes from his review of the literature that the various ap- proaches appear to be incompatible and that, while a synthesis might be desirable, it is problemmatic. It is our view that by attending to the process of evolution more political scientists may find a com- mon ground that accommodates differing perspec- tives and comprehends dramatically different strate- gies for political change without sacrificing criteria for comparative analysis, as earlier approaches may have done. Conclusion It is time for political science to join the evolutionary synthesis, a synthesis which began with Darwin (not just in The Origin of Species but also in his impor- tant work on human evolution and societal evolution in The Descent of Man) and which continues to grow in its power and scope down to the present. For politics is at heart a biological phenomenon. It is a product of the evolutionary process and, for the most part, serves what are ultimately biological ends. Furthermore, politics has become a major cause of evolutionary change. This trend predates the appearance of Homo sapiens, but our species is, as Aristotle truly noted, a distinctively political ani- mal. Equally important, the future of our planet, for better or worse, will be significantly shaped by our political actions (or inactions). If we persevere in the affectation that political development is somehow sui generis and that we can remain safely within the confines of our own disciplinary cocoon, we will only preserve the theo- retical anemia that has long afflicted the social sciences. Not only must we begin to break down the barriers separating comparative politics, interna- tional relations, and empirical theory, but we must begin to incorporate into our world view the accumu- lating wisdom of evolutionary biology, sociobiology, ethology, anthropology, psychology, sociology, eco- nomics, and history, among other disciplines. How- ever forbidding such a task may be, we can do no less if we are to understand fully the dynamics of political development and political evolution. There</page><page sequence="14">154 is some evidence that political scientists are begin- ning to apply an evolutionary approach to politics. (In addition to the present authors, see also Masters, 1983; Phillips, 1980, 1981), but this is only a begin- ning. To quote the conclusion of an article published in a major political science journal more than a decade ago: "If we should choose to accept the evolutionary view of society, then we will have to face up to the far more difficult challenge of trying to build a social science based upon it" (Corning, 1971:370). In our view, this is a challenge that can and should, finally, be met. Notes 1. This is a revised version of a paper presented at the annual meeting of the Northeast Political Sci- ence Association, New Haven, Conn. (November 1982). Partial support for the preparation of this article was provided by a grant to Peter Corning from the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, whose assistance is hereby gratefully acknowl- edged. Comments offered by Benson Ginsburg in the panel discussion are also appreciated, as are the comments on closely related papers by Hayward Alker, Robert Carneiro, James Davies, Karl Deutsch, Glendon Schubert, Elliott White, Thomas Wiegele, and Fred Willhoite. 2. One exception is the work of Coleman (1971), who was inspired by Talcott Parsons' revival (masked by new terminology) of Herbert Spencer's nineteenth century orthogenesis, which differs markedly from a truly Darwinian framework (see below). Coleman further confuses the issue by treating historical and evolutionary approaches as different from one an- other, and by assigning to the "development syn- drome" phenomena that are here treated as contin- gent aspects of political evolution, as opposed to development. 3. Eckstein (1982) also called for the use of a longer time frame, as did Lasswell (1968) and Riggs (1981). From the perspective to be adumbrated here, how- ever, their depth of field was still quite shallow and their orientation was not truly evolutionary. 4. Blute (1979) showed that a truly evolutionary perspective was then still lacking in the social sciences. Rather, the social sciences were commit- ted to what Blute called "the natural law approach of sociocultural evolutionism." The descent with modification approach of biocultural evolution which we are advocating, avoids the criticisms of earlier developmentalist approaches and satisfies the need for a more historical approach that is at the same time capable of leading to theory. 5. Spencer has become a virtual nonperson among twentieth century social scientists, and some of his cardinal contributions to social science theory are often attributed to others, most notably Emile Durk- heim. Yet, Spencer was the premier social evolution- ist of his age and one of the leading intellects of the nineteenth century. For a detailed discussion of Spencer's contributions, see Corning (1982). 6. It should be noted that Huntington has employed the term in several different senses. Sometimes he uses it as we do here to mean a decline in functional efficiency. At other times, though, he uses it as an antonym for development qua increased institutional complexity. In this sense, decay means structural simplification. In actual usage throughout Hunting- ton's writings, however, one also finds the term used in relation to such things as emergency rule by decree, banning of opposition parties, and military coups?i.e., a decline specifically in participatory, democratic institutions. 7. For the application of the concept of architecton- ics to the study of political development, see Brai- banti (1968). 8. Some anthropologists prefer to use the term "devolution." However, we use the term favored by evolutionary biologists. Devolution implies a reversal or unwinding of some inherent evolutionary direction or course and is therefore misleading. Regression, on the other hand, refers to a change in any specified contingent trend. That too is a form of evolution. 9. Many theorists seem to assume that increased structural complexity necessarily translates into greater functional capabilities or efficiency, but this is not by any means a certainty. In many cases, "complexification" may amount to nothing more than running to stay in place. An elected legislature may do no more than provide an imperfect func- tional equivalent for the face-to-face communica- tions that regulate tribal societies. 10. It should be noted that there is much more of an affinity between economics and theoretical ecology (or what has been called "bioeconomics") than is often assumed to be the case. For one thing, both "economics" and "ecology" are etymologically linked to the Greek word for "household", oikos. Indeed, some of the more popular definitions of economics (there is no one, universally accepted definition) could well serve for both economics and ecology: (1) management of the household, and (2) allocation of scarce resources to achieve various objectives or ends. There is, of course, a school of thought, both in biology and economics, that em- phasizes competition, or the division of labor, or both, as the defining subject matter of the two disciplines (Ghiselin, 1974, 1978; Hirschleifer, 1978). However, the broader definition has the advantages of being focused more pointedly on the underlying problem of "earning a living" and less on how it is accomplished. In either event, some of the same phenomena are common to both disciplines (e.g., competition, coop- eration, specialization, the division of labor). Further- more, many of the quantitative techniques for ana- lyzing individual behavior prove to be equally</page><page sequence="15">155 serviceable in either discipline. Because economists and bioeconomists are both concerned with ends- related individual choices, decisions and actions, both have made extensive use of benefit-cost analy- ses, optimization models, strategic choice models and game theoretic models (see especially Wilson, 1975; Krebs and Davies, 1978). Of course, there are also some important distinc- tions between ecology and economics. Perhaps the most important one has to do with the fact that ecology is focused on adaptive (Darwinian) values? on needs that are related to biological survival and reproduction through time. By contrast, the science of economics has traditionally been value-related; it has deliberately avoided approaches to the analysis of human behavior that involve the use of some external value criterion beyond the individual's tastes. 11. Though some students of international relations have been using the term "ecology" to characterize an orientation that consciously encompasses the physical and biotic milieu of human societies, our usage is much broader. The closest approximation to our usage is Russett's (1967). However, his formulation is still more limited than ours. He uses the term with reference to the relationship between a political system and the "social and physical environment." Another step is required to reach a multilevelled cybernetic systems-within-ecosystems paradigm (see Orr, 1979). 12. "There is a tide in the affairs of men which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune: Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries" (Julius Caesar, Act IV, Scene iii). See also Schlesinger (1939) and Deutsch (1979). 13. For a more recent assessment of participation and democracy in relation to theories of moderniza- tion/development see Huntington and Nelson (1976). For a view of the disagreement over the causal relationship between modernization/develop- ment and democratic government see Powell (1982). For an earlier expression of doubt on this relation- ship and the possibility of corporatism see Rogowski and Wasserspring (1971). 14. Lerner's propositions grew out of a larger frame- work in which "modernity" was (correctly) viewed as a systemic phenomenon that was characterized by a high degree of co-variation among the various dimensions or sectors of a society. Lerner's book was a seminal work among functionalist-oriented developmental theorists. 15. The role of communication processes as a variable was discussed in detail by Lerner in his 1958 volume and by Deutsch (1953). It was further developed subsequently by, among others, Pye (1963), Almond and Verba (1963), Fagen (1966), McCrone and Cnudde (1967), Brunner and Brewer (1971), and Dahl (1971). 16. Supporting evidence can also be found in the writings of the so-called "neo-corporalist" theorists, who view the state as potentially a partially autono- mous actor in shaping the process of economic development, both internally and in the international arena. See especially Pike and Stritch (1974), Chirot (1975, 1980), Hammergren (1977), Malloy (1977), Wiarda (1977), Collier and Collier (1979), Berger (1981), and Nordinger (1981).</page><page sequence="16">156 COMMENTARIES Recasting Mainstream Conceptions of Political Development Ronald H. Chilcote Department of Political Science University of California Riverside, California 92521 The plea of Corning and Hines to replace the concept of political development with that of politi- cal evolution addresses the conceptual obfuscation engendered by the plethora of definitions that per- vade the literature on development. In a cogently argued paper they review the mainstream literature and briefly refer to alternative perspectives now well- entrenched in the mainstream of social science. They recast these perspectives through synthesis of abstract ideas and set forth the parameters in which a theory of political evolution might be utilized. Their push for interdisciplinary inquiry attempts to under- mine ethnocentric and value-laden notions of politi- cal science. All these advances, however, merit critical assessment. This reformulation suggests a number of prob- lems. First, the argument is not innovative. If we were to return to Darwin and the nineteenth century evolutionary paradigm, might not we also look at Engel's debate with Lewis H. Morgan over the rise of the state in Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State (1884)? Or examine in more depth than do Corning and Hines the attempts of other contemporary writers to link politics to an evolution- ary perspective? Deutsch (1963), for example, re- lated his "nerves of government" to cybernetics and a search for a value-free political science. His ambi- tious scheme was of interest during the ascendancy of behavioralism in political science, but in hindsight it had little influence on the discipline or on a conceptualization of developmental processes. At the University of Chicago, Easton (1965) partici- pated in an interdisciplinary seminar, and his con- ception of the political system was strongly influ- enced by the life sciences. He argued (1965:14) that "Just as we may have a general theory of motion in physics or of life in biology, we require a general theory of the vital processes in politics." The organic or physiological assumptions of Easton are ex- amined critically by Astin (1972). Second, the authors unfairly characterize political development as only involving "the organizational capabilities or capacities for achieving social goals." While much literature emphasizes this usage, there also is an abundance of writing on development that addresses the solving of old problems in the "new" ways Corning and Hines attribute to political evolution. Third, they briefly review the theoretical implica- tions of functionalist theory, modernization theory, social mobilization theory, political economy theory, world systems theory, dependency theory, and con- temporary Marxism. They do not, however, recog- nize sharp theoretical and methodological distinc- tions in these theories or overlapping characteristics that link some of them to each other and to the authors' evolutionary view. Despite criticism of these approaches, their preference lies with mainstream functionalist theory, and they fault world system and dependency theories for excessive emphasis on "externalities" and suggest that "internal and exter- nal forces may reciprocally affect one another," a point stressed by dos Santos (1970) in his well- known definition of dependency. They miss the</page><page sequence="17">157 main point in a debate (Chilcote, 1982) over Marxist criticism of capitalist development and dependent underdevelopment perspectives, to wit, that con- temporary theory benefitted from the questions raised two decades ago by dependency theorists about diffusionist theories of development, and that Marxist theory today has transcended the old ideas, moving on to theories associated with modes of production and internationalization of capital. Fourth, the authors suggest that the role of the state has been underestimated, a view also gener- ally acknowledged in the self-criticism of Weiner and Huntington (1987), in the grand synthesis of Carnoy (1984), and in the pioneering essays edited by Evans, Ruesdeneyer, and Skocpol (1985). Corning and Hines focus, however, on the autonomy of the state as an independent variable rather than the search for a class theory of the state. It would be interesting, for example, to question to what extent the form and function of the state are determined by relations of class within the capitalist mode of production or whether the state can successfully manage and implement programs and policies that represent competing and contradictory interests of different classes. Fifth, their abstract reformulation (although re- plete with examples) does not guide us in inquiry or elaborate how political evolution can be measured or evaluated; they suggest measuring capabilities and effectiveness "in relation to one or more contin- gent historical trends" If indeed historical perspec- tive is the ingredient necessary to solve the inade- quacies of developmental theory, then the authors appear to have overlooked the historical emphasis in world systems theory or the historical materialist thrust of Marxist theory. Corning and Hines correctly condemn most politi- cal scientists for defense of disciplinary autonomy and argue for an interdisciplinary perspective of political behavior. Thus, mainstream conceptions of political development as representative democracy, pluralism, or civic culture, as well as preoccupation with order and stability, were but manifestations of the parochialism of simplistic views reflective of the Anglo-American experience and advocated during the 1960s. Corning and Hines ask that we escape our disci- plinary isolation, break down barriers between sub- fields within political science, expand our world view to include other disciplines, and apply an evolution- ary approach to politics. I believe, however, that if we were to extend their approach to historical experience we would find their desired theory to be not value-free, but based on normative grounding. We might find that the political dimension of devel- opment/evolution involves participatory democracy based on grassroots and collective actions rather than formal indirect or representative democracy. Such participation would extend beyond boundaries of government and political parties, and include classes and groups outside and within the state. It would be linked to economic and social conse- quences, largely dependent on the mode of produc- tion (under capitalism and socialism), the provision of basic human needs through capital accumulation and the egalitarian distribution of its rewards to raise the quality of material life of all people. The process of development/evolution, however, would be un- equal, uneven, and would combine modes of pro- duction through history. It would involve advances in the productive forces of society. The contradictions of economic and political issues in the struggle for participatory democracy, egalitarian distribution of resources, provision for basic needs, and so on might lead to crisis and eventually to resolution. Obviously the above assumptions are drawn from my own experience in struggling to unravel the complexities of the developmental question. They reveal that development/evolution cannot be a neu- tral, value-free process and that the political person will be involved, perhaps in shaping or responding to evolving and changing economic conditions, divi- sion of labor and relations of production, class forces, and the political and ideological apparatuses of state and society.</page><page sequence="18">158 Commentary on Corning and Hines Robert A. Packenham Department of Political Science Stanford University Stanford, California 94305 Corning and Hines' assertions at the beginning of their article are correct. The political development literature is in "disarray." There is dissensus on definitions and measures. The term 'political evolu- tion' is seldom used in any technical or precise sense. Political scientists are mostly "unaware of the burgeoning literature... on the causal dynamics underlying the evolution of society in general and of politics and the state in particular," and their "knowledge of pre-modern politics" does tend to be "sketchy." The time is "ripe" (as always?) for "fresh approaches." The introduction or reintroduction of "an evolutionary perspective" could be, depending on how it is defined, a "radical departure" from dominant frames of reference in political science. The implication of these statements is that their article will address these problems and lacunae and contribute to resolving or filling them. That implica- tion is made explicit when the authors state that "the distinction we have drawn between political development and political evolution cuts through one of the most pervasive sources of confusion in political development theory." All of this is promising. However, I find more promise than fulfillment. The authors do not reduce the disarray, confusion, or dissensus about defini- tions; they mainly stake out their own position within that context. This is legitimate, but not a break- through. Their definitions of political development and political evolution, and the distinctions they make between these two concepts, are, like many others in the literature, plausible and not entirely without interest. But these definitions and distinc- tions, again like many others in this literature, are not very precise and are presented more than used. It would have been interesting to learn about the "burgeoning" literature on political evolution, but the authors tell us little about it. They use much more space rehashing the development literature or analyzing works in other areas of political science. There are only a few scattered paragraphs on pre- modern politics or non-human politics, whatever that might be. Hence there is no sustained presentation of what would seem to be the most intriguing aspect of their original promise, a coherent argument about political evolution bolstered by data or documented research on pre-modern or non-human politics. Let us examine some specific points in more detail. Corning and Hines define politics in cyber- netic terms. They define political development in terms of cybernetic superstructures. Political evolu- tion is defined as "functionally significant political innovations." They seem at this point to want to make a good deal of this distinction between politi- cal development and political evolution. However, later they define not only political evolution, but also political development in functional terms. They also offer the same explanation for both political develop- ment and political evolution. These facts suggest that the distinction is not so firm or important for them. In a rough sense, their distinction may hold up, but it is not precise or entirely clear. Corning and Hines state several times that the concepts of politics, political development, and po- litical evolution can and should be applied to all "socially organized species," including not only humans but honeybees, wolves, chimpanzees, lions, and baboons. They claim that "politics is at heart a biological phenomenon," both a product and a cause of evolution. It is far from clear what this means, but if they want to take this position, so radical a departure from what political scientists normally think of as the political, then it urgently calls for explication. But we do not get it. Instead, the authors switch to a very contemporary, human discourse, invoking the Port of New York Authority and the European Common Market as examples of "truly evolutionary change." This kind of switching back and forth in the referents of evolution is confusing, if not incoher- ent, and in terms of the claims the authors make it is disappointing. It would be challenging and novel, if not necessarily persuasive, for a political scientist to be told how political evolution occurs within and among species. It is old hat to have the evolutionary metaphor applied to such contemporary examples. The authors complain that "the world view of the development theorists was (and still is) confined to a very narrow segment of our evolutionary history." That is a plausible statement, but then why do the present authors say so little themselves about a broader segment of that history? Their presentation of "data" about "prehistoric" political evolution is accomplished in two sentences! Why are most of their examples taken from contemporary history? Why, in short, do they do the same as those they criticize? Next the authors pose the question of "how to account for the evolutionary trends described above," i.e., the trends from pre-history to the present described on the preceding two pages. (To this reader, at least, it is mind-boggling to suppose that such a complex dependent variable has been specified in two pages. But let that pass.) The</page><page sequence="19">159 subsequent discussions of multileveled explana- tions, ecosystems, and the parallels between firms and markets on the one hand, and cybernetic sys- tems and ecosystems on the other hand, have some interesting features. This is perhaps the most sug- gestive part of the article. It does appear to relate to literatures on interdependency, ecology, and the evolution of cooperation that have adherents and contributors in political science. Scholars in these fields might find this section of interest. All that is to the good. However, that section is brief, speculative, and not very well integrated into the rest of the article. It is also based on a faulty premise, namely, the idea that political scientists in general and students of political development in particular have discouraged "fishing expeditions" into other disciplines. To the contrary, political scien- tists are a community of fishers. Indeed, what distin- guishes political science as a "discipline" is pre- cisely its eclecticism. It is a confederation of different disciplines focussed on politics rather than a coherent discipline with agreement on theoretical and methodological fundamentals. What makes this short section more interesting than the others (at least to me) is not that it uniquely adopts the principle of going off into other disciplines, but that the specific direction it goes off to happens to be one that has not yet been much explored. The final section makes comments on the political development literature. Some of this oversimplifies. Much of it is sensible. But little of it is new. Most of these comments can be made, and have been made frequently, independently from the ideas on evolu- tion presented in the body of the article. Hence, this section is not so much wrong as unnecessary. I conclude with three general, summary points. First, the strength of the paper seems to me to be the suggestiveness of some of the ideas about political evolution. It might be useful to pursue them ?in particular to give them greater historical and empirical depth, sharpen them conceptually, and differentiate them more both historically and con- ceptually. This will not necessarily interest a great many political scientists, but it might interest some. Merely proposing it and offering abstract categories about it will not have nearly as much impact, however, as using it in actual research might have. Second, the discussion of political development in the article is not new and probably not necessary for what appears to be the authors' main purpose, i.e., dealing with political evolution. It is not clear that the subject of political evolution, as they describe it, either requires or takes much benefit from dealing simultaneously with the concept of political develop- ment. The literature on political development is concerned with many important topics that deserve attention in their own right. But that literature proba- bly will not be helpful for, or even relevant to, the study of honeybees, baboons, or wolves. It may be more relevant to the study of pre-historical political evolution but that too remains to be seen. Studies of political evolution may, when done, illuminate politi- cal development?if so, fine. But meantime the study of political evolution can, and it seems to me ought to, proceed on its own without reference to the literature on political development. Finally, metaphors and analogies are used a great deal, perhaps excessively, in this article. Political development is likened to cybernetic processes and to social engineering; political evolution is said to be akin to architectonics, and to tides, and to be part of the larger process of biological evolution. Is this abundance of metaphors and analogies helpful? Are they all consistent with one another? Are tides architectonic, for example?</page><page sequence="20">160 Onomantic and Semantic Considerations Fred W. Riggs Political Science Department University of Hawaii Honolulu, Hawaii 96822 Corning and Hines make a useful contribution to the study of politics by distinguishing sharply between "political development" and "political evolution." Their emphasis on the multidisciplinary dimensions of real life changes as they occur (and have oc- curred) throughout the world is also needed. We must, assuredly, go beyond political science, both to the other social sciences (including economics) and also, notably, to the life sciences. Some of the distinctions the authors associate with these terms are extremely important. For exam- ple, they distinguish between "situation-specific" and "species wide" contexts. For them political evolution predates human existence and refers to a wide range of adaptive strategies designed to meet survival needs. By contrast, political development normally focuses on contemporary changes taking place in selected countries. They state, metaphori- cally, that political development is ontogenetic whereas political evolution is phylogenetic. They also discuss the micro-level/macro-level distinction, and introduce a world system perspective. Most writers on "political development" focus attention on nation states without considering the related issues of world order and global political develop- ment. The authors usefully discuss linkages be- tween levels, notably between individual coopera- tive behavior and large-scale politics. Although these distinctions are very helpful, we must beware of taking metaphors too literally. Evolu- tionary theory as applied to the biological origins of species entails, for example, Darwinian hypotheses about genetic mutation and chance as the basis for adaptive changes enhancing the survivability of species. However, humans, as political beings, may increasingly design changes intended to meet their needs instead of relying on accidental innovations. A more prosaic problem involves the way social scientists use language. We have a fundamental semantic problem well illustrated in the authors' analysis. For them, two key words, development and evolution, signify the basic political variables. How- ever, we need a much larger vocabulary of key words?e.g., democratization, social mobilization? to grasp the many dimensions of political change. In their assessment of Deutsch's work on social mobili- zation, Corning and Hines suggest that Deutsch collapses it with democratization, economic growth, urbanization, modernization?and with development and evolution. Since we have all these words, let us use them for independent variables. We should study their relationships, but not try to combine them into any single catch-all process. Consider economic growth. Much of the develop- ment literature presupposes a direct relation be- tween political development and growth. But as environmental problems lead us to consider limits to growth, the need for a "steady state" economy and for "intermediate" technology, we will increasingly question the assumption that there is, or ought to be, any direct correlation between growth and politi- cal development. The truth is that "development" has acquired so many meanings that it cannot be used except in a very vague and general sense (Riggs, 1984). It does make sense to talk about "development studies" the same way one speaks of research on the "third world." In both instances we see a wide range of related and dynamic phenomena deserving of in- quiry, but we do not identify a single variable. Corning and Hines come close to recognizing this fact when they cite Huntington and Dominquez on the '"alarming proliferation' of definitions and theo- retical approaches... yet little of it has been cumu- lative." The reason is because social scientists are so averse to neologisms that, whenever they need a new concept, they appropriate an established word, like development, and stipulate a new meaning for it. A fully documented example involves anthropo- logical re-definitions of culture (Kluckhohn, 1952). Such words become increasingly equivocal, convey- ing a host of possible meanings. Scholars trying to identify the meanings of a key word become so frustrated that they often stipulate new definitions, thereby only adding to the cumulative confusion. Not only development, but most key words in our vocabulary have acquired so many meanings that all social science discourse tends to bog down in ambiguity and confusion (Riggs, 1986; Sartori, 1984). To cope with this problem, we need to learn to think onomantically rather than semantically Instead of starting with words and asking what they mean, we should begin by explaining the concepts we need and then select terms that can unambiguously designate what we have in mind. When the authors ask "What is political development? And how does one measure it?" they imply that there can be a</page><page sequence="21">161 sensible answer to this question. In fact, however, the question is fundamentally unanswerable. To appreciate the problem, look at the index to Roget's Thesaurus, where we find under most words a list of synonyms, each representing a different meaning of the indexed word. Under develop, for example, we find become, augment, grow, result, produce, urbanize, enlarge, progress, evolve, mani- fest, educate, photograph, get better, make better. We cannot collapse these ideas into a single vari- able. Instead, when using such words, we must specify which of their possible meanings is in- tended. When the authors quote my report (Riggs, 1981) on the declining usage of the term, "political devel- opment," they miss the main point. I was not talking about any particular concept. The problem was that this phrase had come to mean so many things that it became a clumsy tool and it was discarded. How- ever, in this case, it had also become an "autonym," i.e., a term used to represent words (not concepts) that are seized upon because of the prestige, power, money, or other benefits that may result from their use, even though there is no consensus on what the term means. In this case, funding for research on "political development" led many fund- seeking researchers who had never used the term before to "jump on the bandwagon." Predictably, they would not abandon their own specific substan- tive and theoretical interests in favor of definitions imposed by a funding agency and an organizing committee. Consequently, many definitions for differ- ent concepts were framed by scholars who wanted research support for their own preconceptions. Con- fusion increased until funding for research on "politi- cal development" dried up. Many writers then aban- doned the term in favor of others that could more clearly express their ideas?or could release re- sources linked to new catchwords. The concept of an autonym resembles that of a catchword,shibboleth,or power-word but not one of these terms signifies precisely what I meant by autonym (Riggs, 1981). This example illustrates the semantic/onomantic dilemma. Had I re-defined any existing word to mean what I meant by "autonym," the proposed new usage would not replace older ones. However, when one does coin a new term for a new concept, readers usually dismiss it as a mere "neologism" or affectation, and try to replace it with a familiar word even though it already has another meaning. The original intention naturally gets lost, as it does in the Corning and Hines treatment. Although political scientists have often used the term "political development," they have avoided "political evolution," for fear of its connotations, even though the literature, research, and theories on "evolution" contain interesting ideas that could be fruitful in the study of political history, innovation, or change. Moreover, some writers have used "political development" to cover evolutionary themes. On the basis of my (1981) essay, Corning and Hines con- cluded that my work was "not truly evolutionary" (note 3), but some of my other writings do indeed have an evolutionary perspective?although in a time horizon of a few thousand, not a few million, years (Riggs, 1966; 1970). One might suppose that "evolution" is a more clearly defined term than "development," but Roget's gives us ten different senses of "evolution," for each of which there is a separate entry. One such entry, headed by the word evolution, gives as syno- nyms "development" and "growth," among other words. Even this term, therefore, is ambiguous. The main fear, however, has been a suspicion that the biological context of the more important evolu- tionary theories could not be used as a metaphor for human social history without inducing grave errors. Eisenstadt (1968:228) tells us that "Evolutionary theory dominated sociological thought in the nine- teenth and early twentieth centuries, but since about 1920 interest in it has, on the whole, given way to preoccupation with systematic analysis of social systems...." Lewontin (1968:209) explains how the "principle of natural selection" was con- verted by Herbert Spencer in the mid-nineteenth century into the doctrine of "survival of the fittest" which was used "as a justification for laissez-faire practices. But it was only the borrowing of a meta- phor to further justify a system already in full opera- tion " (1968:209). Social "evolution" was also used by the Nazis to justify their genocidal policies. By contrast with Spencer's interpretation, Lewontin (1968:206) notes, "Marxism, especially as inter- preted by Lenin and Trotsky, is a straightforward, perfectionist evolutionary theory." Social scientists have felt queasy, since the 1920s, about embracing "evolution" as a metaphor after it had been used to justify run-away capitalism, the Aryanism of the Nazis, and even orthodox communism. No doubt we can reject such "errors" without discarding a term that can still be used for more objective and scholarly purposes. But in doing so, we must make sure that the explanatory contents of evolutionary theory really apply to political history. By this standard, the characterization of political evolution offered by Corning and Hines is disap- pointing. They write that political evolution involves: (1) adopting novel functions; (2) creating novel prac- tices or structures; and/or (3) making adaptive sim- plifications of existing structures. There is no inher- ent direction in such changes, we read, and they are not necessarily "higher." (However, they do suggest that the U.S. is "more highly evolved." But if "citizen participation" and "competitive parties" are the</page><page sequence="22">162 criteria, then one will be puzzled to find that more citizens vote in all European countries than in the U.S. and their parties are much more structured and competitive.) Unless explanations of such changes can be offered, we will do better to describe them under such headings as "political change" or "politi- cal history" than to imply, by the word, "evolution," the existence of explanatory theories that we do not have. To identify dimensions of change is not to explain them. The power of evolutionary theory in biology arises precisely from its explanatory contents. Dar- win's theory offered an explanation for the origin of species. No doubt he had less to say about the survival or extinction of species, an equally impor- tant problem for evolutionary theory, one that is increasingly relevant not only to the ontological problem of death but also the philogenetic problem of human survival. One of the great evolutionary controversies con- fronts the early theories of Chevalier de Lamarck, who argued for the inheritance of acquired charac- teristics, with the later (established) Darwinian posi- tion attributing evolutionary change to natural selec- tion based on genetic mutations. As Taylor (1983:36- 54) shows, despite the discrediting of Lamarckism during the Stalin era by the absurd claims of his protege, Trofim Lysenko, contemporary scholarship seriously questions the believability of Darwin's the- ory and some contemporary research seems to support the Lamarckian thesis. We need not evaluate this dispute to see its implications for "political evolution." Do human be- ings self-consciously select or invent useful new practices that better enable them to achieve their goals and to survive? Contemporary human socie- ties are able, by "Research and Development," for example, to design solutions to some of their prob- lems. However, it is easier to do so at a technologi- cal level?e.g., the design of space travel?than at the level of political institutions, like establishing stable democracies in new states. Nevertheless, during the bicentennial of the Amer- ican Constitution, Americans are celebrating the cleverness of the founding fathers who designed a basic formula by which, in general, we still organize our political life. When we try to go back to pre- human political evolution, however, as Corning and Hines propose, I suspect that all social innovations were unintentional. How, for example, do we explain the origins of "the state"? There is a rich literature on this question. One hypothesis makes it an uncon- scious result of conquest and resulting political domination within environmentally constricted do- mains from which conquered communities could not escape. No doubt such conquerors intended to conquer, but they surely had no intention to form a state. Fortes and Pritchard (1940:5-6) offer us case stud- ies of selected African political systems, some of which have governments and others do not. They characterize the former as "states," and the latter as "stateless." While giving qualified support to the conquest theory, they also emphasize cultural and geographic factors. Cohen and Middleton (1967:xi) prefer ecological explanations for the appearance of leadership among "acephalous" societies. Major institutions have, of course, evolved and the authors could have helped us by discussing some of the more basic ones. For example, the institution of kingship, based on ritual and supernatural beliefs, was fundamental to traditional polities. Its prehis- toric origins and structures have been well de- scribed by Hocart (1927, 1936). At best, however, unaided kings could govern only small domains. The invention of bureaucracy as an institution, dating back some two thousand years, has been attributed both to the Chinese and the Romans. By appointing, on a non-kin career basis, a hierarchy of public officials and by elaborating mechanisms designed to recruit qualified persons and maintain effective con- trol over their conduct, the rulers of bureaucratic empires were able to dominate huge domains. Democracy, in large-scale bureaucratized polities, could only be realized by means of a new institution centering in a representative assembly. Backed by popular elections and political parties, such assem- blies are a modern invention, dating back no more than two centuries. The American Constitution first incorporated such an assembly in a flawed design that instituted deep structural clashes between its chief executive and the legislature. The later British invention of a parliamentary cabinet system estab- lished a more flexible system based on political responsibility between the head of government and the representative assembly. One-party authoritari- anisms, which evolved only in this century, also established elected assemblies ("soviets"), but be- cause they are dominated by the ruling party, they do not maintain an open polity. Almost all contempo- rary states now have such assemblies, although there is great variation in the way they work and the amount of power they can exercise. In the modern context one might suppose that each polity could borrow superior innovations devel- oped elsewhere. Most theories of "modernization" focus on such projects, how members of one society emulate practices originating in others. Clearly, how- ever, such modernizing projects are very costly and often fail. Moreover, ruling elites in each country not only exercise power, but their interest in preserving their own authority and privileges keeps them from making the sacrifices needed to institutionalize more</page><page sequence="23">163 responsive and more efficient governmental institu- tions (Riggs, 1964:206-215). Lewontin (1968:203) identifies five principles that may be found in different kinds of evolutionary theory: change, order, direction, progress, and per- fectibility. "Some," he writes, "include only change and order, others add direction, and some few... believe in perfectibility as well." It would be interesting to discover which of these variables Corning and Hines would include in a theory of political evolution. Just such an exercise would strengthen what is already, of course, a stimulating and important essay.</page><page sequence="24">164 AUTHOR'S RESPONSE Dissent with Frustration: Coming's Response Although I will respond to each commentator sepa- rately, some of my responses will be applicable more generally. Chilcote charges that our approach is not innova- tive and he alludes to nineteenth century predeces- sors. So do we. We stress that we are seeking only to extend to a particularly insular area of political science a paradigm that for decades was rejected by most social scientists. In the past, the evolution- ary paradigm has often been caricatured and mis- represented. Even now, in the midst of a strong revival, it continues to be misunderstood and under- valued (viz. all three commentaries on our article). We are charged by our commentators with draw- ing crude analogies with "physiology" and of using evolution as a metaphor. Nothing could be further removed from the facts, and we stressed that point in the article. On very sound theoretical grounds, we are extending the evolutionary paradigm itself to political phenomena. A passing acquaintance with the current literature in evolutionary biology, sociobi- ology, anthropology, biosociology, or biopolitics should make it abundantly clear that behavior in general, and social behavior (and "culture") in par- ticular, fit comfortably under the evolutionary um- brella. We are talking about something far more challenging to conventional political science than a facile analogy. Chilcote does not like our use of a cybernetic definition of politics. Surely he can appreciate the legitimate ground that abstraction and generaliza- tion are essential prerequisites for theory building (the "mode of production" is another example). In addition, we are merely employing a framework with which many other political scientists are quite com- fortable (contrary to Chilcote's opinion). But more importantly, this approach has the virtue of provid- ing a definition (and a basis for causal theory) that transcends eras, transcends particular institutions, transcends systems, transcends modes of produc- tion, and even transcends our own species. Accord- ingly, it provides a framework for a multidisciplinary theory of politics and political evolution. Chilcote also accuses us of ignoring the work in political development on "innovation." Far from ig- noring it, our basic point is that political develop- ment theory ignores the necessary distinction be- tween innovative (architectonic) phenomena that have evolutionary significance and "engineering" activities that are repetitive, imitative, and unproduc- tive of historical change. In effect, apples and or- anges have both been labelled "apples" by political development theorists. Finally, Chilcote charges us with advancing a normative theory. Do we, indeed, have a weakness for democracy? To repeat our statement in the text: "... political evolution cannot be assumed to be undirectional or orthogenetic; there is no universal law of evolution, nor any certain path toward growth or progress (however it may be measured). Again, political evolution may be characterized in Darwinian terms simply as 'descent with modification'. That is, political evolution consists of functionally significant structural innovations over time in various political processes or institutions... It is critical to our usage that the term evolution be understood clearly, be- cause of the obvious linkages that have been drawn in the past between the idea of progress and the concept of evolution." Packenham's critique was even more disap- pointing. The underlying cause of his blandly nega- tive comments was a failure of imagination. To be specific, he finds, first, that we "do not reduce the</page><page sequence="25">165 disarray" in political development theory. We dis- agree. We think that some people may find it enlightening to learn that apples and oranges are in fact different from one another; we have drawn a distinction that we think will aid in theory building. I invite Packenham to ponder?deeply?the distinc- tion between engineering and architectonics and to consider the implication of the following paradox: One and the same political system, process, or institution can be both an example of political development, from an engineering point of view, and from an architectonic point of view a significant evolutionary phenomenon as well. The distinction has more to do with one's theoretical focus than with the causal forces involved. Related to this is Packenham's observation that both our definition of development and of evolution are functionalist and utilize the same "explanation". Well, yes and no?and so what? Apples and or- anges are both tree fruit. They have some important physical and functional (adaptive) similarities, as well as important differences. But metaphors aside, there is no inconsistency in placing two closely related (and sometimes interrelated) types of phe- nomena in a functionalist paradigm. Nor does it necessarily require different explanatory frameworks. Thus, the theory of evolution encom- passes imitative phenomena as well as innovative phenomena. Both types of phenomena share in ultimately being "tested" in relation to their func- tional effects?that is, natural selection. A similar subtleness is associated with the theory that synergistic effects can be causal in both devel- opmental and evolutionary terms. Moreover, what makes the theory even more subtle and challenging to conventional thinking is the fact that the "syner- gism hypothesis" is not a theory about things; it is a theory about the causal influences exerted by the relationships among things. Packenham also casts aspersions on our argu- ment by wondering aloud whether a theory is valid that can be outlined in two pages. If he has doubts, he is welcome to read my book-length treatment of this theory. Our main purpose in introducing the theory at all in this article was to anticipate the familiar criticism that our distinction was merely an exercise in semantic hair-splitting?just definitions and no theoretical payoffs. So we are damned if we do and most certainly would have been damned if we didn't. We are also criticized by Packenham for not giving sufficient attention to non-human and pre- modern examples of political evolution and of "con- fusing" him by relying on contemporary examples. (Here, truly, is a case of "damned if you do... ") The usual criticism of the writings in biopolitics is that it is steeped in the ethological and anthropological literature and doesn't really demonstrate its applica- bility to the phenomena of "political science." In this article we deliberately chose to rely on "acceptable" examples. Nevertheless, we are criticized for doing so. If Packenham really cares to learn more about the work relating to political evolution in ethology and anthropology, I urge him to read the lengthy reviews in The Synergism Hypothesis, (Corning, 1983) or any one of literally hundreds of books and articles that have been published over the past decade that bear on the subject. Most troubling of all was Packenham's head-in- the-sand conclusion. Perhaps, he opines, political development and political evolution theory should go their separate ways and leave political develop- ment theorists to muddle along, safe in their com- fortable tower of babel (where all paradigms are created equal). To reiterate our basic argument: The political development literature frequently includes, but does not explicitly deal with, evolutionary phe- nomena. Indeed, the failure to draw this distinction contributes to the muddle, as we tried to show. We think the field of political development can profit from our distinction. Perhaps it will result only in a purging of tacit evolutionary issues and studies from the field. Or perhaps a miracle will happen and the field will rise to the challenge of a broader theoreti- cal paradigm. Either way, there will be some benefit. But Packenham's negativism gives us little reason for hope. Riggs, too, thinks we are using the evolutionary paradigm as a metaphor. But Riggs' grasp of evolu- tionary theory is tenuous and his single source is dated. (In fact, it predates the current revival.) The modern theory recognizes that evolutionary causa- tion is far more subtle and complex than Riggs supposes. Much evolutionary change is initiated by behavioral change. Purposive, or "teleonomic" se- lection is therefore a major influence both in biologi- cal and in biocultural evolution (a position some- where between Lamarck's and Darwin's). Related to this point is Riggs' charge that our use of the term evolution is "empty" because it is not associated with a theory. Evidently he did not read our footnotes. Not only does the theory of evolution itself fit the bill, but 77?e Synergism Hypothesis advances an explicit theory about the evolution of complex systems. I was not diffident about citing this work in the article. Riggs also engages in a lengthy discourse on semantics that, among other things, disparages the very purpose of our article. He thinks our questions, "What is political development? and how do you measure it?" are "fundamentally unanswerable," because, he says, we should first identify a phenom- enon and then pick a label for it, instead of the other way around. Riggs did not notice that we did just</page><page sequence="26">166 this. We started by identifying communications and control (cybernetic) processes as the phenomena we wished to call political and to theorize about. (Roget, incidentally, is a questionable authority on definitions, since the very purpose of that work is to cluster together words that may be only vaguely related to one another). But these things pale compared to an unscholarly and perhaps inadvertently malicious association that Riggs makes between modern evolutionism, nineteenth century Social Darwinism, and Naziism. This is a very serious and unwarranted innuendo and must be totally repudiated. The problem is that Riggs is virtually ignorant of modern evolutionism?the vast outpouring of work across several disciplines that has no roots in, or connection with, the ideological diatribes of nine- teenth century theorists. Because Riggs is unin- formed about this literature, his thinking is still mired in the tradition of liberal twentieth century reaction- ism?a tradition that for many years was a source of great, unreasoned prejudice against social scien- tists who had the temerity to go fishing in the waters of evolutionary biology. (Contrary to Packenham's claim of open-mindedness in our discipline, some waters have long been labelled unsafe for fishing.) The Social Darwinist episode is a dead horse, as many outstanding evolutionists of the past thirty years have striven to show. To bring such innuendos into the discussion at this late date is tantamount to a smear. ?Peter A. Corning Dissent with Modification: Hines' Response Let me begin by saying that I do appreciate several of the commentators' observations and I shall re- spond to those below. Before doing so, however, I must add that there are a number of suggestions in the commentaries that seem to me useful only to the extent they reveal the failure of the commentators to read our article carefully, to do a little homework, to grasp some of the points we were making, or all three. I am mindful of the fact that all three commen- tators are recognized scholars in the more traditional field of comparative politics who may have had little or no contact with the literature of politics and the life sciences. Nor should I assume they would have any familiarity with the substantial literature in an- thropology, archaeology, history, and social biology dealing with the evolution of social systems and the origins of the state upon which we have drawn and which has become so familiar to Corning and me that we are sometimes forgetful of the need to provide more examples and references, depending upon the reading audience. I must also protest that all the commentators have responded as if we had unlimited space in which to elaborate our argument and provide detailed evi- dence in support of that argument. Such liberties are seldom available to authors, even in book-length manuscripts. I grow weary of being criticized for the book I didn't write. Corning at least has written such a book (The Synergism Hypothesis, 1983) and I highly recommend it as well as forthcoming book- length treatments of politics and the life sciences by Roger Masters (Yale University Press) and Glendon Schubert (Southern Illinois Press) which bear on some of our argument. So much for visceral reac- tions and on to substantive points. I am especially appreciative of Chilcote's sugges- tions of additional literature in comparative politics that would need to be addressed if we are to pursue our effort to establish the concept of political evolu- tion and the approach to comparative politics we are advocating within the discipline. In particular, the very recent literature concerning modes of produc- tion, capital accumulation, the effects of class struc- ture and struggle, and class/state-capitalism/social- ism dynamics, much of which he treats in his 1984 volume, Theories of Development and Un- der development, is important and increasingly influ- ential among students of comparative politics. I believe the findings of that research and of other studies of political economy, most of which are rigorously historical and contextual, offer numerous examples of both political evolution and of political development (as we have defined those linked terms). Moreover, I would make the claim that our ap- proach, to the extent it is normatively concerned with adaptation in pursuit of survival, offers a far more comprehensive framework than any of those he has so thoroughly and usefully reviewed. Quite clearly, however, our approach fails to make the ultimate judgment of whether or not a particular</page><page sequence="27">167 case of political evolution is "the best political system" extant at any particular moment in time. But that is (and I hope Chilcote would agree) a different, however paramount, question. One which, as he notes in his commentary, must be asked by each "political person" and by collectivities of politi- cal persons (See also, Hines 1978, 1981). Indeed, earlier conceptions of political development were so encumbered by implicit or explicit answers to that question as to render them of limited value as categories of analysis for political science. I hasten to add that to the extent Chilcote be- lieves we are advocating a return to the nineteenth century evolutionary paradigm, he is correct in as- serting that we should look as well to Engels' debate with Morgan. But we are not advocating a return to the nineteenth century evolutionary paradigm. Our approach is informed by contemporary evolutionary theory in all its richness and controversy. We are advocating that political scientists recognize that politics is, in a fundamental sense, a part of a much larger, more comprehensive process; that process is a biological process and that biological process is evolutionary. This statement does not mean that politics is "biologically determined" in the naive reductionist sense. As Laszlo (1987:3) points out: Evolution, as the reader well knows (unless of course he or she is a stout creationist) is the process that brings into being the many biologi- cal species that surround us and indeed include us. But evolution is not limited to biological species: if other things in the cosmos were not created as they are but came into being in the course of time they, too, must have evolved. Physical scientists claim that all the furniture of the universe?stars, galaxies, interstellar matter, even space and time as we know them?came into being in a vast process called cosmic evolu- tion. And social scientists tell us that modern societies likewise developed from earlier, less complex forms of organization among human beings. Unless one wants to reject the secular notion of historical existence, one can no longer avoid recog- nizing that evolution applies to society and that we have an intellectual responsibility to explore the implications of that insight for political theory. Similarly, Riggs' query about how our perspective compares to the five components of evolutionary theory identified by Lewontin in 1968 strikes me as another way of raising the same issue, namely the extent to which there are normative underpinnings to our enterprise. I believe we have been quite forthcoming on that issue and I can only refer the readers to our discussion of "Progress" and Political Evolution and to lengthier discussions in Corning (1983) and in Laszlo's Evolution: The Grand Synthe- sis (1987). I cannot accept Riggs' conclusion that the ques- tion "What is political development?" is "fundamen- tally unanswerable" unless perhaps he would ex- plain further what he means by that statement. It is only unanswerable in the sense of there not being a general consensus among political scientists as to the use of the concept because, to date, the con- cept has been bound up inextricably in very conten- tious normative theories. Actually, the meanings given to the concept of political development by the highly partisan proponents of competing ideologies are what has made the question appear to be unanswerable. Riggs' conclusion has the effect of returning us to the subject of the interminable debates over the extent to which there is any possibility of a scientific study of politics. I have stated my position on that question (Hines, 1979, 1982) and I can't begin to address such a large issue here. Obviously the "embedded" nature of concepts is a matter of great concern to Riggs, otherwise why would he do us the disservice of linking our use of contemporary evolutionary theory and the life sci- ences to earlier ideological abuses of Darwinian evolutionary theory? It is so disappointing to read of "fear," "grave errors," "racists," and "perfectionist evolutionary theory" in the context of an appraisal of our article without ever specifically addressing and refuting our discussion of progress and political evolution. Given that contemporary evolutionary the- ory (biological and social) is so significantly different from earlier Darwinian evolutionary theory and is so readily accessible to the interested political scien- tist, one would hope such facile and pejorative castigations would be avoided. The informed critic might correctly ask us to respond to the important debates characterizing evolutionary biology today (e.g., the theory of punctuated equilibrium), but that is another issue altogether. Riggs and Packenham have asked important questions about our treatment of (or lack of attention to) the origins of the state and concrete examples of the evolution of innovative political structures. Both Corning (1983) and I (Hines, 1983) have discussed the origins of the state and there is indeed a very rich literature, for the most part in anthropology, which informs us on this matter. It is precisely that literature on which we have drawn in developing our approach. But it is true that political scientists need to use those historical cases to enrich their study of comparative politics. As we noted in footnote 3 and elsewhere in our article, more attention must be given to prehistory and the early state, including "kingship," if we are to accurately capture the realities of politics. Packenham has gone so far as to offer the inter- esting alternative of urging that the study of political</page><page sequence="28">168 evolution (as we define it) be pursued for its own sake with little or no regard for the study of political development. While that certainly could and should be done, that alone would constitute political his- tory. Why would we not want to incorporate those findings into political theory? One of the gravest errors in contemporary comparative political inquiry has been our failure to make full use of historical research. No one said it better than Hirschman (1970) who showed how vacuous political science research can be in the absence of a grounding in good historical (and anthropological) research. And if we cannot compare novel political structures at different points in history (see Packenham's com- mentary about "switching back and forth in the referents of evolution") how can we ever claim to be doing social science? Time and space are the two dimensions that must be addressed. We frequently use contemporary referents because we are at- tempting to address an audience of political scien- tists who would as readily criticize us for not being "relevant" if our examples were all drawn from earlier historical or pre-historical (or non-human) examples?despite the actual relevance of such examples! I do not dispute the fact that we cannot do justice in a short article to the "trends from pre- history to the present" (Packenham). We and others should do more of what he asks for and, one must hope, do it better. Interestingly, if they took the time to review the literature, most political scientists would be amazed at what is being done by anthro- pologists to shed light on the early state and societal evolution. I look forward to a time when more political scientists will incorporate that work into their own studies. It may well be that our evolutionary approach may at best constitute yet another "island of theory" in comparative politics. Wiarda (1985) refers to this notion of Hoffmann's in the conclusion to a volume devoted to New Directions in Comparative Politics. The implication of Hoffmann and Wiarda's sugges- tion is "that we should accept the fact there is no longer a single, overarching paradigm on which all or even most students in the field can agree" (Wiarda, 1985:209). They and Chalmers also suggest the need for "bridges among the islands of theory" or "constructing causeways among the archipela- gos" (Wiarda, 1985:210). Leaving aside the difficul- ties with all these metaphors, their characterization of the field of contemporary comparative politics does seem reasonably accurate. Obviously, we might hope that the concepts of political evolution and political development as we have defined them might serve the useful purpose of bridge-building or of allowing for communication among scholars work- ing from the vantage point of different perspectives. Viewed from an evolutionary perspective, both coop- eration and conflict among theorists are possibilities. Time will tell whether an innovative "grand theory" will evolve and develop. ?Samuel M.
