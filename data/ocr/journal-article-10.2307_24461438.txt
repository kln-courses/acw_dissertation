<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nancy Fuchs-Kreimer Holiness, Justice, and the Rabbinate Three Tales At the beginning of the sixteenth century, a man named Jacobo and his wife, Esperanza, expelled from Spain, settled in S'fat in the North of Israel. Since Jacobo knew only Spanish, he never fully understood what went on in synagogue. One Shabbat he heard the Torah verses from Leviticus 24:5-6 in which the Children of Israel are instructed to give God twelve loaves of challah in the ancient wilderness tabernacle before the Sabbath. He came home full of excitement, "Esperanza! God likes challah for Shabbat and you bake the best challah in the world. Next Friday bake twelve loaves and we can bring them to the synagogue for God." So Esperanza baked her best challah, kneading her good intentions into the dough. Friday afternoon, when no one was around, the two brought the twelve challahs to the synagogue, arranged them neatly in the ark, said "Bueti apetito" to God, closed the ark and left, very happy. A few minutes later the janitor came in with his broom. "Dear God," he said as he stood before the ark. "My children are starving. I need a miracle." He opened the ark and, finding the challahs inside, he smiled. He had believed that God would provide. The next morning when the rabbi opened the ark during services, Es peranza and Jacobo saw immediately that God had eaten evexy loaf. They winked at each other with satisfaction. And so this continued week after week, year after year. Esperanza baked, the janitor and his family ate. Rabbi Nancy Fuchs-Kreimer teaches at Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Philadelphia. Her article was given as a talk at a Lilly Foundation seminar on the ministry, November 1991. 212 CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="2">Thirty years passed. One Friday, Esperanza stood before the ark and said, "God, I'm sorry about the lumps in the challah. I'm getting old and my fingers don't work as well as they used to. I hope you enjoy them anyway." At that moment, the old rabbi of the synagogue appeared and grabbed Esperanza and Jacobo by the collar. "What are you doing, you fools?" he cried. "We are giving God his challahs." "Don't you know that God doesn't eat?" "You may be a rabbi, but there are some things you don't know. God most certainly does eat. In thirty years he has never left behind a crumb." "Lef s hide in the back of the synagogue and see what really happens to your challahs," said the rabbi. A few minutes later the janitor came in. "Dear God, I don't like to com plain, but your challahs have been getting a bit lumpy lately. Still, it's keeping my family alive." He reached into the ark to get his challahs and the rabbi appeared and said, "Stop, you terrible man. Maimonides has taught us that God does not have a body. He doesn't bake challah and he doesn't eat challah. All three of you have been committing the sin of anthropomorphism!" At this, the janitor, Jacobo, and Esperanza all began to cry. The good couple was crying because they had merely wanted to serve God. The jan itor was crying because he suspected this meant no more challahs. At that moment the great kabbalist Isaac Luria entered the room. He turned to the old rabbi. "You must go home immediately and make sure your will is in order. Thirty years ago your time had come to die, but the Angel of Death was called off because God was having so much fun watching what went on in your synagogue. Now it is over, and you will be buried this week, before the Sabbath begins." Then he turned to the weeping couple and the janitor. "Now that you know who has been eating your challahs, who has been baking your chal lahs, you must continue to bake them and eat them anyway. Jacobo and Esperanza must bring them every week directly to the janitor. And you must all believe with perfect faith that it is God who bakes and God who takes and that God is no less present in your lives."1 Some rabbis as early as the sixteenth century knew, as this story indi cates, that God neither bakes nor eats. So why are we today telling such an old and fanciful tale, one so replete with the sin of anthropomorphism? Will the bony hand of some rationalist old rabbi come out and grab me by the neck? I hope not, for there is more anthropomorphism to come. I shared this story because I believe it says something important not only about holi SUMMER 1992 213</page><page sequence="3">ness and justice but also about religious leadership. My next story is about the same subjects and, far from being fanciful, is actually true. It is taken from the memoirs of the recently lamented Isaac Bashevis Singer. When Singer was growing up, his father was an East European rabbi who presided over a humble Beth Din, a rabbinical court. Simple Jews from the town came to the rabbi in his living room to receive legal judgments on problems in their lives. One Saturday evening, Singer recalls, a ragged individual appeared at the door. "Rabbi, I want to ask you a question. Does Jewish law permit a man to sleep with his dead wife?" "I do not understand," the rabbi stammered. "I am not insane. My wife died on Friday night. We live in a cellar with many rats. The funeral will take place tomorrow. I have only one bed and I cannot sleep on the floor for the rats will get me. I do not want the rats getting the corpse either. Last night, I sat up all night, but now my strength is gone. What does the law say?" At that moment Singer saw his father's face as he had never seen it be fore. It was flooded with tears. There was one gush and everything was wet—eyes, cheeks, red beard. He cried out to his disciples who were gath ered around him. "Let us do something." The men did not have money with them because it had been the Sabbath so they all ran in different di rections home to get their wallets. Singer's mother rushed to the kitchen to prepare baskets of food. A man returned to the house a few minutes later with a cot. Within the hour a crowd of men and women accompa nied the poor widower to his basement to clean, to furnish, and to supply. The young Singer remembers the following week as a grim one. Food was scarce in his house; his mother had given the better part of it away. His father, distressed by the nightmarish squalor he had seen, spent his time in his study praying, "Dear Father in Heaven... it is high time for salvation... time... high time."2 My third story may seem to be a strange one for a talk on theology be cause it comes from an ethnographic study of a group of Jews who frequent political meetings more often than synagogues. In the context of the mod ern rabbinate, however, Barbara Meyerhoff's classic study of poor elderly Jews in Los Angeles can be seen as a religious text, albeit an unconven tional one. Meyerhoff's work is about survivors, people with frail health and insufficient income but full of "irony, dignity, humor and conscience." Meyerhoff was about to leave on a trip to Jerusalem. She was called aside by one of her subjects, an elderly woman named Beryl. "Here is a dollar," she told the anthropologist. "When I left Russia seventy years ago my father 214 CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="4">gave me ten rubles to give to a poor man I found in America. That way my trip would be a safe one because I was a meshiach3 mitzoa, a messenger on a holy journey." Other members of the community overheard Beryl and soon Meyerhoff had over two hundred dollars in crumpled bills to deliver to needy people in Israel. When she returned, Meyerhoff brought with her dozens of crocheted objects which had been sent as a token of gratitude by the elderly Israelis in the sheltered workshop to which she had donated the money. As she departed, the anthropologist heard the group making plans to auction off the gifts and send the money they raised to really poor people. She concluded that in their world "there are no beggars, no charity, only webs of donors."4 These three stories will serve as my text later on, as I explore a new model for religious leadership that tries to unite the passion for justice and the passion for holiness in a viable vocation. First, however, I will look at the rabbinate5 today as it grapples with these questions in the shadow of its two great teachers: Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig. Buber and Rosenzweig It is difficult to imagine training rabbis today without the teachings of two great Jewish thinkers who emerged during German Jewry's final years of glory. Buber died old and honored by Christians as well as Jews. Rosen zweig died young and relatively unrecognized by the non-Jewish world. Yet, for reasons that will soon become clear, Rosenzweig may well be more important than Buber as an influence upon rabbis.6 Their work taken to gether provides us with two models for the rabbinate. Yet there remains a need to bring these two models together if we are to attain an ade quate Jewish vision of the rabbinical vocation as one involving justice and holiness.7 Martin Buber's multifaceted corpus — which includes writings on the Bible, Hasidism, Christianity, psychology, socialism, and education — is based upon one core idea: dialogue. Buber taught us that at the center of spiritual life is the command to be present, to be responsible (that is, to have the ability to respond). This was not a new idea; the midrash includes the observation: If you greet your fellow person truly, it is as though you con fronted the face of the Shechina.8 Gabriel Marcel speaks of this readiness and availability as disponibiliti. But Buber made that idea work in vivid and compelling ways. In an unforgettable autobiographical confession, Buber taught a genera tion to think of spirituality not as a set of special experiences but as a way of being in the world. One afternoon he was in his garden after a morning of SUMMER 1992 215</page><page sequence="5">intense "religious experience." A young man called on him, and although Buber was polite and answered the questions the young man asked, he didn't really listen to the young man, nor did he respond to his unspoken questions. Later Buber learned from another, for the young man had since died, that the man had come not for a casual chat, but in an hour of des tiny, for a true meeting that did not occur. Buber, who wrote so brilliantly on encounter—on learning from another's simple presence that meaning lessness cannot be the whole truth — had missed the mark.9 But he taught us something about being a rabbi: to be religious is to be available for con nection and dialogue, on the individual level, on the communal, and finally on the societal levels. Buber taught us to heed Isaiah when he said, "Do not hide yourself from your own flesh" (58:7) — on all these levels. For example, Buber was an early and passionate advocate of a two-state solution in Israel, based upon dialogue between the two peoples who called Palestine home. He took the notion of dialogue to each arena in which he participated and, by connecting political action, education, and theology, both conceptually and through his life, he gave us a new prism through which to read the Bible and the rest of Jewish tradition. The problem, of course, is that whole chunks of that tradition are not illumined by Buber and, indeed, remained marginal for Buber himself. One of those large areas is halacha — the vast network of rules that governs the minutiae of Jewish personal and communal life. As Buber said, "I do not believe that revelation is ever a formulation of law. It is only through man in his self-contradiction that revelation becomes legislation. This is the fact of man. I cannot admit the law transformed by man into the realm of my will, if I am to hold myself ready as well for the unmediated word of God directed to a specific hour of my life."10 Which brings us to Rosenzweig, his critique of his friend Buber on this issue, and the reason Rosenzweig is so important to rabbis today. For Rosenzweig, it was precisely through the law that one might come to know God, although Rosenzweig preferred to speak of commandments, rather than law. "Only in the commandment can the voice of him who commands be heard. No matter how well the written word may fit in with our own thoughts, it cannot give us the faith that creation is completed, to the degree that we experience this by keeping the Sabbath... one hears differently when one hears in doing."11 Rosenzweig helped a generation of non-Orthodox Jews move beyond such Reform abstractions as "the prophetic tradition" or "the brotherhood of man [sic]" to an embracing of Jewish law as a path to a spiritual life. In this view, the rabbi becomes the technician who makes the calendar, lit 216 CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="6">urgy, life-^ycle rituals, and disciplines such as Shabbat and Kashrut work for people — it is a conception of the rabbi as creative priest. What Rosen zweig introduced was a way to appreciate the law in a nonfundamentalist manner, to take the ritual life of Judaism (to quote Niebuhr out of context) seriously but not literally. Liberal Judaism today is very much committed to Rosenzweig's project. Rosenzweig taught us that in Judaism the calendar is the catechism, ritual is a form of prayer, and the wealth of Jewish prac tices is something that commands us, even if ultimately we don't choose to perform them all. Rosenzweig, when asked if he put on tefillin each morning, responded, "not yet." He taught, in Mendes-Flohr's words, "the sacramental power of the law." Buber brought holiness and justice together in his life, but he did so while bypassing the center of gravity of Jewish tradition. He chose not to limit his freedom to be spiritually and ethically responsive by a prior com mitment to a body of rules and regulations. Rosenzweig provided a new way to look at the question. We needn't be halachic or antihalachic, but as Jews we need to be halachically sensitive. Unfortunately, Rosenzweig did not help us to connect this with the social justice teachings of Judaism. While caring a great deal about morality, Rosenzweig believed that Jews as a group live outside history and thus he did not focus on Jewish corporate responsibility in society. Today most of us reject that aspect of Rosenzweig's teaching. We are struggling for models to bring together what has been sep arate — a valuing of the Jewish path of law (which Rosenzweig showed us is about holiness) along with a valuing of social action toward a just world (which Buber showed us is about holiness). But how? Gemilut Hasadim — Dealing Out Caring12 In Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education,13 Nel Nod dings argues that the field of philosophical ethics has been overly focused on the process of reasoning. The language has been one of laws, princi ples, propositions, ideals, theories. Words such as "fairness," "equality," and "justice" have predominated. What would happen if we allowed women's voices14 to contribute to the discussion on their own terms? Noddings ar gues that a different vocabulary would emerge. This vocabulary would include words such as "caring," "relationship," and "responsiveness." In the body of her book, Noddings analyzes the experience of caring in sufficient philosophical detail to prove that women's voice in philoso phy is not an excuse for sloppy thinking. What is even more interesting for our purposes, however, is the educational agenda she offers at the end. Because it rejects law as male, some might assume that it has little in com SUMMER 1992 217</page><page sequence="7">mon with a distinctively Jewish approach,15 but I found the opposite to be the case. Noddings suggests that schools be set up so that in addition to learn ing to reason about moral issues, students actually learn how to care — for people, for animals, for their homes, their physical surroundings, the en vironment. They should learn to tutor small children, carry a bed pan in a nursing home, assist in an animal shelter, plant bulbs in a public park. They should see the acquisition of these skills as of equal value to learning geom etry and history, despite the fact that in our society caring is mostly done by unpaid and undervalued women, while there is great financial reward for knowing math and history. But what Noddings is trying to sell to Americans as a female approach to character education is hardly a revelation to Jews who are familiar with a Jewish caring community. To grow up in such a community means to learn how to take care of people; not only women do it and not only rabbis do it. The Jews have built up a host of communal structures, a web if you will, that seek to protect people from cradle to grave from the ill effects of isolation. They developed organizations that made free loans, that visited the sick, that buried the dead, that cared for people in distress. These societies often were called gemilut hasadim societies in recognition of the rabbinic notion of a value (and a realm of behaviors reflecting that value) which were referred to by the same phrase. Gemilut hasadim was seen to be related to tzedakah (the just redistribution of wealth through personal giving). But it went beyond it in at least three ways16: tzedakah involves money, while gemilut hasadim involves one's person and one's money; tzedakah is given to poor people, but rich or poor can be recipients of gemilut hasadim, and, while charity is given to the living, even the dead17 are in need of gemilut hasadim.18 Gemilut hasadim is deeply rooted in understandings of holiness. There is a concept familiar to Christians which also runs very deep in Judaism — imitatio dei: we are to be holy, for God is holy. How do we learn from God how to be in this world? The midrash is charming on this subject, sug gesting that in the Bible we can learn manners and menschlikeit (humane behavior) by watching how God behaves. One rabbi pointed out that God never interrupted Abraham during his Sodom and Gomorrah speech, an act of politesse and patience considering that God knew all along that there would be no righteous men found.19 Or, to take another example, what could God have meant when he said, "Let us make man in our image?" Surely not polytheism! Rather, God was modeling for us an inclusive and graceful way for a manager to make his inferiors feel included in a job!20 Fi 218 CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="8">nally, Rashi explains the strange question God asks of Adam in the garden. Surely God who knows everything knows Adam's whereabouts! Indeed he does, but it would be rude for him to barge in on Adam unannounced. Instead, he asks, "Where art thou?" God's profession is dealing out caring, gemilut hasadim. When Abraham tells his children to keep the ways of the Lord he is told by God, "You have chosen my profession!"21 What does it mean, asked Rabbi Chama ben Chaninah, to walk after God? It means to act as God acts. In the Garden of Eden, God made Adam and Eve garments of skin and clothed them (Gen. 3:21); therefore one should clothe the naked. And God, in the form of three Angels, came to Abraham when he was sitting at the opening of his tent in the heat of the day, presumably recovering from his circumcision which had just taken place (Gen. 18:1). So, we can conclude, one should visit the sick. It was God who provided for the first couple at their wedding, even helping to adorn the bride and assisting in her coiffure (Gen. 2:28). And did God not comfort Isaac after the death of his father? (Gen. 25:11) So too should we comfort the bereaved. Finally, at the end of the Torah (Deut. 34:5), who was it who buried Moses? In all these examples we learn what acts are involved in following after God.22 The Talmud's description of what it takes to engage in imitatio dei is very interesting. Those jobs, except burying the dead, are today largely female activities! Another example of gemilut hasadim is hospitality to wayfarers, yet another female role in our society. In Jewish tradition it is dignified and valued as a religious command, not overlooked as women's work. Indeed, Abraham is often praised as an exemplar of the fulfillment of this command. The Talmud goes so far as to say that the duty of hospitality is greater than that of welcoming the presence of God. Using a strained reading of Genesis 18:3, it notes that God appeared to Abraham, followed by three men, and that Abraham, eager to serve the three men, simply told God to sit back, wait and "don't go anywhere."23 The notion of gemilut hasadim directs us to the seemingly small details of life and to the recognition that God is indeed "in the details." Recently, some Jews have begun to use the phrase tikkun olam (the mending of the world) to talk about the Jewish religious duty to be activists in the societal arena. In its use in Kabbalah, tikkun olam offers an incredibly rich meta phor with which to speak about our work for social justice and peace. Interestingly, the phrase is also used in early rabbinic works. There, one is repeatedly struck by the potential smallness and ordinariness of the ac tivities which are labeled tikkun olam. Often in the Mishnah it turns out to be amending a law so that it more adequately protects the least vulnera SUMMER1992 219</page><page sequence="9">ble. In one midrash, we learn that the reason the Torah prohibits one from taking the mother bird along with the egg she is sitting on (Deut. 22:7) is that the mother bird, by incubating her unborn offspring, is "engaging in tikkun olam!"2* In the second blessing of the amidah (the prayer of eighteen blessings recited three times a day) one finds a praise for God's power—exemplified most fully in His ability to resurrect the dead, an ability which is asserted five times in one paragraph. Also mentioned in this blessing is God's control over wind and rain. Yet this is also the blessing in which one hears God described in ways that one can imitate: He supports the fallen, heals the sick, and looses the bonds of those who are captive. We know God when we have fallen and experience support from other people, when we are sick and are healed, when we feel trapped and are freed. We also know God when we engage in these activities of support, of healing, of helping to free others. And we especially know God when we find ourselves supported, healed and freed by a community that exists to serve God by caring for its members and for others. The notion of God presented in the second blessing of the amidah is one of absolute power. Yet many of us read that blessing in a different way. We understand that in some ways God cannot carry out all the tasks God is praised for in this blessing, though it be God's will that they be carried out. Thus, we are not so much imitating God as assisting or even substituting for God. A Hasidic story points to that reality. One of those individuals who were forever challenging the Jews posed this, quite reasonable, query, "You say you are supposed to help poor people. But if a King put someone in jail, who are you to bring the prisoner food?" The answer is both beautiful in its metaphor for God's love and remarkably honest in its recognition of God's limitations. "You are right. But what if for some reason the King had to put his own son in jail? Wouldn't he really be pleased if we brought him food?" We engage in gemilut hasadim to be like God and also to do what God would, but cannot, accomplish. The commandments concerning gemilut hasadim are both political in their implications and sacramental in their power. They concern justice and holiness. But what do they have to do with the rabbinate? The practice of dealing out caring is incumbent upon every Jew; in no way are these commandments directed specifically toward rabbis. What, then, does the emphasis on these commandments as the nexus of holiness and justice have to say about the role of the rabbi? 220 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="10">Models of Leadership: the Prophets vs. the Book of Ruth A leading feminist theorist, Catherine Keller, begins her recent book25 by reminding readers of the classic Western models of maleness and female ness: Odysseus and his wife, Penelope. The hero sets off from his home by himself, encounters adventures, and overcomes odds, finally returning to the hearth at journey's end. Penelope, on the other hand, never leaves her birthplace. She stays at home, daily "weaving a mighty web" that she unravels every night. The burden of Keller's book is that classical Christian theology has heard the voice of Ulysses but not that of Penelope. The "separative self" emerging from the life experiences of the male has provided the model for a separative God, as well as the Christian vision of the religious life. Women with their endless weaving, their rootedness in home and rela tionships, their "soluble self," haven't had much impact, much opportunity for their experience to be mirrored in religious ideas and ideals. Unfortu nately, maleness in this system was defined as normative humanity and femaleness became "otherness." When we turn to Judaism, we find quite a different situation.26 There are indeed two models: one I associate with the prophets and the other with the Book of Ruth. These models reflect quite well the alternative vi sions associated in the West with maleness and femaleness. But, and here is where Judaism differs, the prophetic model, far from being considered normative, is largely supplanted by the alternative model in rabbinic Ju daism. The vision of holiness and justice and the relationship between them that emerges from the Book of Ruth may have striking similari ties to what Western feminists call "female ethics"; in Judaism it is simply normative. The first model is that of the classical Hebrew prophet who speaks God's word to the people 27 He is often lonely — if he has a family life at all he is absorbed by his vocation.28 He is not a team member; he is a leader. There is a universe of black and white for the prophet. God fits in as the one who speaks directly to the prophet and tells him the truth. Ultimately, most modern Jews don't believe we know God's word well enough to be God's spokespeople; life has become much too complicated and issues far too gray. We suspect someone who claims to preach God's truth to us, and for good reason. Further, we are made uneasy by the whole image of the prophet.29 The model Ruth provides is different. Ruth does not find God by go ing off into the desert and hearing a voice. She chooses to follow Naomi SUMMER 1992 221</page><page sequence="11">and join her community, pledging that Naomi's God will become her God. At that point, she knows little of what this God will be like. But she soon learns something about community. She learns that in Israel the cor ners of the fields are not to be plowed but rather left to the poor (Lev. 19:9-10). She is able to eat and to feed her mother-in-law. Boaz refers to God when he says to Ruth, "under whose wings you have come to take refuge." Later she learns that the kinsmen of her late husband have cer tain obligations toward her; as the story unfolds, Boaz follows the laws of redeeming kinsman and becomes her husband. Ruth finds refuge "under the wings," but those wings turn out to be the laws which guide peo ple in that society into protective relationships with one another. Ruth is taken up in a community, in relationships, in protections built into the Israelite way of life. One doesn't need the miracle of Naomi's elderly breasts giving milk to know that by the end Ruth has also come to know God. Why is the model of the separate individual seen as male? Why do women so much more consistently see life in terms of relationships? Are the differences so frequently observed between the sexes a matter of anatomy? A major breakthrough in psychology occurred when Nancy Chodorow ar gued that, since women are almost universally involved with the care of young children, the experience of male and female children is essentially different. Males grow up by separating from someone who is different from themselves, mother; their maturation involves a more emphatic individ uation and a stronger firming of ego boundaries. Women, on the other hand, experience themselves as like their caretaker and early learn fusion, empathy, attachment, and ongoing relationship.30 How, then, to explain my argument that Jewish society is more "female" in its orientation, that its view of morality already includes the notions of caring and relationship that feminists are urging upon our Western culture? This is a question which deserves sustained study; I would only suggest that the Jewish historical experience created a situation in which strong community was imperative for survival. The psychiatrist Willard Gaylin points out that if one thinks of oneself as an individual, caring for others is self-sacrificial. But when one shifts perspective and sees oneself as a mem ber of a group, then caring becomes "the ultimate self-serving device — the sine qua non of survival."31 Jews have thought of themselves as nothing if not as members of a group, and it is in the crucible of this intensely com munal experience that there emerged the theology of holiness and justice which I am labeling both feminine and Jewish. 222 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="12">A New Model of the Rabbi If Ruth were to have become a religious leader, how would she teach others about the God she came to know? By preaching God's word? Hardly. She would work to bring others under God's wings. The rabbi, in this view, is a weaver like Penelope, though without the unraveling at day's end. First, the rabbi must weave a web of relationships that will support and sustain the rabbi. While rabbis teach people to take care of one another, they often forget to ensure that the community also nourishes them and/or that they develop for themselves other systems of support.32 Caring for oneself and one's health — mental and physical — is part of Jewish law.33 Rashi, noting that the requirement to pray regu larly was listed in close proximity to the requirement of gemilut hasadim, remarked that daily prayer was an act of loving kindness/caring toward oneself.34 What an excellent text for a rabbi! Second, the rabbi is an organizer/educator, helping the congregation see itself as a web of caring. The rabbi can do this by introducing the various structures of Jewish communal life that have traditionally protected and guarded Jews from the time they enter this world until they depart from it. I give only two examples; they could easily be multiplied. The chevra kadisha is a traditional Jewish burial society. Some rabbis are beginning to revive these societies with their congregants as a protest against the commercial ization of the funeral industry and as an opportunity for Jews to take on a realm of mitzvot which has been ignored in the non-Orthodox world. There are detailed rules concerning the care to be given a corpse from the moment of death to the moment of burial and additional rules concerning the care of the mourners. A committee of laypeople can study these rules and take on this mitzvah as a service to others in the congregation.35 Another example would be the traditional Jewish societies for visiting the sick. In his congregation, Rabbi Harold Schulweis trains what he calls "para-rabbis," who make hospital calls on congregants. Of course, as Schul weis well knows, it is only in America that we would ever have assumed that visiting the sick was the rabbi's task. Congregants engaging in gemilut hasadim are not becoming para-rabbis; they are ttaining to be good Jews.36 Moving out from the community to the larger society, rabbis can help their congregants develop personal and communal practices that recognize the caring function — mending the tears in the webs — of the society we live in. Because food has, since biblical times, had enormous religious sig nificance in Judaism,37 and because food preparation has traditionally been a female realm (the laws of keeping kosher were among the halacha that SUMMER 1992 223</page><page sequence="13">women were educated in), it seems that the development of a new, ethical kashrut should be high on the agenda of the kind of rabbinate I am describ ing. Arthur Waskow has challenged Jews to create a set of rules concerning foods that are acceptable and unacceptable based on categories relating to environmental impact, workers' rights, and other ethical concerns.38 This kashrut might be observed in addition to or in place of traditional kosher laws.39 Here is one excellent way of healing the Buber/Rosenzweig split. Waskow is taking rules that were intended to be about holiness, and relat ing them to justice as well, allowing the Jewish system of regulating daily life to become an avenue for both. Obviously, the ultimate and necessary extension of this view is to be come advocates in the political arena for social structures which provide the protection for the vulnerable that the institutions of gemilut hasadim tra ditionally provided within the community of Jews. When caring is under stood as a religious duty, there is a natural flow from caring for the indi vidual to caring for a community to caring for a society. The personal and the political are no longer in tension, nor is there a gap between spirituality and the activism. Most importantly, Jewish law has been brought back into the discussion in a most useful way. When one observes Jewish ritual law around a wedding and then gives away one's wedding gown to dower a poor bride, one has engaged in imitatio dei/gemilut hasadim. One has con nected with Jewish law at exactly the point where holiness and justice meet. The laws that protect the vulnerable ultimately create the sheltering presence, the wings of God beneath which we find security. Three Tales Revisited It is time to return to our opening three tales and ask what we have learned about the rabbinate, justice, and holiness. What was going on in the synagogue with Jacobo, Esperanza, and the janitor? They were making the world more just, and, in their innocence, they thought it had some thing to do with God. The good couple thought that in giving to the poor they were giving to God and the janitor thought that in receiving he was getting from God. They were all correct. The rabbi's life was extended for thirty years because during those thirty years he had, quite unintention ally, achieved the goal of the rabbinate. His synagogue was functioning the way a synagogue should. His lay people were serving God by taking care of each other, and the Torah ark was the center of it all. Alas, the rabbi did not understand the quality of what was happening in his synagogue and so he put a stop to it and thus merited the death that had been his due thirty years before. A true rabbi makes the synagogue a place where peo 224 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="14">pie do God's work and receive God's work and thus have God in their lives. In non-Orthodox Judaism, the rabbi is no longer called upon to answer halachic questions such as the one the poor widower brought to Singer's father. Most Jews do what they like (except in the case of life-cycle func tions when they become very concerned with the rabbi's rules).40 Yet, if the question asked Rabbi Singer is irrelevant, the answer Rabbi Singer gave is enduringly pertinent. If we cannot mobilize our communities to take care of one another, to support, heal, and free each other as needs arise, then we surely are failing, even if we are leading spiritual services and doing important social action in the wider society. Finally, Barbara Meyerhoff's informant Beryl, though she had her He brew confused, reminded us of a wonderful image from our tradition. The person engaged in a mitzvah will be protected on his or her journey.41 In the case of the mitzvot of gemilut hasadim this is quite literally true. In pur suing our journey through life, if we are mitvah messengers in the sense that we are serving a community through the mitzvot of gemilut hasadim, we are also likely to be protected by that same community from at least some of the worst ravages of unkind fate. Perhaps Beryl was pointing to a deeper truth when she brought the messiah into this whole process: in the time of the messiah, all humanity will become one caring community I close with a true story. When my friend Joy became a rabbi, one of her first duties with her new congregation was to consecrate the six boys and girls who were beginning the Hebrew school kindergarten that year. She called them up to the Torah for a blessing, which is standard. She then gave them each a handknitted yarmulke as a gift, which is not common but neither is it remarkable. She then told them, casually, that she had knitted the yarmulkes for them herself. You could see the faces light up. The rabbi really cared! She wasn't worried that those who had doubted the wisdom of opening the rabbinate to women would snicker (aren't rabbis supposed to read Talmud, not spend their time knitting?). She knew that God had made garments for Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and thus it was her religious duty to make garments. Her real profession, she knew, was not knitting, but weaving. She was reweaving the tattered sacred canopy of her community as she learned along with them how to weave a net in which the small and vulnerable would be held in safety. One could hear the fluttering of the wings. SUMMER 1992 225</page><page sequence="15">Notes 1. This is my edited version of Zalman Schachter's recounting of a tale by Isaac Luria from Shivhei ha-Ari. A more literal translation can be found in Chaim Bloch's Legends of the Ari under the title "The Holy Sin." Lawrence Kushner has a fine version, from which I have also borrowed, entitled "The Hands of God," in The Booit of Miracles: A Young Person's Guide to Jewish Spirituality (New York: UAHC, 1987), 55-59. 2. Retold from I. B. Singer, In my Father's Court: A Memoir (New York: Fawcett, 1980). 3. Beryl appears to have remembered inaccurately the Hebrew phrase shaliach mitvah; the concept of a mitzvah mission protecting a person comes from Fesachim 8b. 4. Barbara Meyerhoff, "Surviving Stories: Reflections on Number Our Days," Tikkun 2, no. 5,19-25. 5. It should be clear that I am discussing the rabbinate in the non-Orthodox world. 6. Milton Himmelfarb noted the enormous influence of Rosenzweig on the rabbinate in his introduction to The Condition of Jewish Belief, 1967 (Northvale, N.J.: Jason Aronson, 1990). 7. The idea of Buber and Rosenzweig as representing two sides of modern Judaism that need reconciling was inspired by Paul Mendes Hohr, "Law and Sacrament: Ritual Observance in Twentieth-Century Jewish Thought," Jewish Spirituality II, ed. Arthur Green (New York: Crossroad, 1987). 8. Mechilta, ed. J. Z. Lauterbach (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1976), 2:178. 9. See Martin Buber, Between Man and Man (New York: Macmillan, 1985), 13. 10. In a letter from Buber included in Franz Rosenzweig, On Jewish Learning (New York: Schocken Books, 1955), 111. 11. Ibid., 122. 12. The Hebrew phrase gemilut hasadim is usually translated as acts of loving kindness. Dealing out caring is my translation, based on the root meanings of gamal and hesed. 13. Nel Noddings, Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. 14. Note that Noddings avoids making the claim that these voices are exclusively or in evitably feminine. She argues the more modest case that they are characteristically so, arising as they do out of the unique experiences of women. 15. Indeed, a Jewish reviewer observed, "Noddings's rejection of rules as a source of or guide for ethics is one that is potentially at loggerheads with the concept of halacha" (Vicky Kelman, review of Caring, The Melton Journal [Spring 1990]: 23). 16. Sukkah49b. 17. This refers to the care and burial of the corpse. It is considered a particularly great mitzvah to show caring for the dead since one cannot possibly expect recompense for it. See Rashi on Genesis 47:29 where the dying Jacob asks his son to "deal with me kindly and truly" and Rashi notes that the kindness shown to the dead is the true kindness (hesed shel emet). Jewish burial societies are often referred to as hesed shel emet societies. 18. This set of three distinctions was considered so important that it was included in the daily prayers. 19. Avot de Rabbi Natan 56a. 20. Genesis Rabbah 8:8. 21. Genesis Rabbah 58:9. 22. These examples come from Sotah 14a, with the exception of the dowering and hair dressing of the bride, which come from Genesis Rabbah 18:1 and Avot de Rabbi Natan 10a. Indeed, gemilut hasadim is the essence of Torah, since the Torah both starts and ends with acts of caring. 23. Shabbat 127a. 226 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="16">24.

I am grateful to Rachel Adler, whose argument that Keller's analysis of a somewhat different point does not apply to Judaism has strengthened me in developing my argument. See "A Question of Boundaries: Toward a Jewish Feminist Theology of Self and Others," Tikkun 6, no. 3. 27. I recognize that my depiction of the prophets relies heavily on the image of these indi viduals transmitted by liberal Judaism, an image that owes a great deal to nineteenth-century liberal Protestantism. In fact, recent biblical scholarship has revealed that "the prophets" were far more varied and complex as individuals and as a group than my simplistic typology would suggest. I write, then, not of the prophets who actually lived but of "the prophets" as a religious type within liberal Judaism. 28.

Nel Noddings has a wonderful rejoinder to Kierkegaard's statement that "if Abraham is lost, so am I." "They're both lost," says Noddings, and they would take the rest of us with them!"

For a good discussion of this issue see Martha Ackelsberg, "Rabbis Are People Too: Politics, Spirituality and the Jewish Community," Reconstructionist (September 1986): 19-24. 33. It is perplexing to me that the Orthodox have not declared cigarette smoking to be strictly forbidden according to halacha. The evidence concerning smoking is surely strong enough and Jewish law is surely clear enough on the subject of harmful substances. 34. See Shabbat 127b, footnote in Soncino edition. 35. See Robert Kanigel, "It Matters How the Dead Are Buried," Moment (April 1980): 67-71. Concerning a burial society he writes, "the dreary and mundane details of death have been almost alchemically transmuted into community bonds that bring the living closer together." 36.

I thought I had heard the last word on the value or lack thereof of traditional kashrut, until I learned that at Mt. Holyoke College there is a joint kosher/hallel kitchen (strictly obser vant of both sets of laws) where Jewish and Muslim students conveniently share bread (but not pork) together and are hoping to start a dialogue program. 40. An amusing example of this: on more than one occasion I have been asked by couples who are intermarrying if the wine for their wedding service has to be kosher! 41. It should be noted that with the dry realism typical of one strain of rabbinic sensibility the Talmud explicitly states that if the journey is exceptionally dangerous this won't work! Fesachim 8b.
