(marchant@miamiu. acs.muohio, edu) 7 VIII 95 More than 20 years ago, in July 1974, a Wenner-Gren Foundation conference (organized by Jane Goodall and David Hamburg) on the great apes took place at Burg Wartenstein, the Foundation's conference center in Aus- tria. Among the participants were William C. McGrew, then a newly appointed member of the psychology fac- ulty at the University of Stifling, and Toshisada Nishida, a young professor of anthropology at the University of Tokyo who had already spent nine years studying wild chimpanzees in the Mahale Mountains of Tanzania. For both of them, the meeting was a rare opportunity to absorb the state of the art in research on apes. Of the 20 participants, i o worked on the common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, 4 on the Bomean orangutan, Pongo p. pygmaeus, and only z (Dian Fossey) on gorillas. No pa- pers were presented on the bonobo, or pygmy chimpan- zee (P. paniscus ); nor were there papers on lowland goril- las or Surnatran orangutans. Only five field sites were represented, and for chimpanzees studies of captive sub- jects were more numerous. All but three participants' expertise was limited to a single species and often to a single field site. As the 20th anniversary of the original conference ap- proached, it was clear that much had changed in the world of great ape research in the intervening two de- cades. With sponsorship by the Wenner-Gren Founda- tion for Anthropological Research, McGrew and Nishida coorganized a symposium titled "The Great Apes Revis- ited,'' held November 12-19, 1994, in Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur, Mexico. The organizers noted that with the increasing numbers of researchers had come increasing specialization and sometimes species- centrisrn. As of the late 1980S, whole conferences had been devoted to either a single genus of great ape (e.g., the Understanding Chimpanzees conferences of 1986 and 1991, sponsored by the Chicago Academy of Sci- ences) or a single species (e.g., the Gorilla Workshops sponsored by the Milwaukee Zoological Society).

In The Great Apes (Hamburg and McCown 1979) a chapter on bonobos was added; there were also other added chapters, and some conference participants did not contribute papers.</page><page sequence="2">Volume 37, Number i, February I996| I43 The second symposium differed from the first in many ways. In I974 field reports dealt only with allopatric populations; in I994 three field sites had sympatric pop- ulations of gorillas and chimpanzees. An important cri- terion for inclusion in the conference was experience with several species of great apes in the field or study of the same species at multiple field sites or both. This reflected the growing need for comparative study within and across the four species of great apes. It was the orga- nizers' aim that the conference be retrospective, in that past accomplishments would be solidified; introspec- tive, in examining the current state of the field (e.g., how much work was descriptive natural history versus theory-driven hypothesis testing); and prospective, con- sidering what might be the wisest use of research efforts in the face of the threat to great-ape populations. They stated their goal as "to update, extend, explore, review, evaluate, clarify, and celebrate the hard-won findings of primatologists who focus on our nearest living rela- tions." They sought contributions that would present theoretical, empirical, basic, and applied knowledge of great apes. They also wanted to promote the discussion of great apes as useful for the realistic modeling of hu- man origins. Great ape research is done by individuals from several disciplines. The conferees included ten anthropologists, eight zoologists, three psychologists, and an ethologist. (Yukio Takahata, an anthropologist, was scheduled to attend but was unable to do so.) Participants had re- ceived their professional training in England, Germany, Holland, Japan, Scotland, and the U.S.A.3 CONSERVATION Goodall led a wide-ranging discussion on great-ape con- servation. Her expertise is mostly with P. troglodytes, but other participants offered their views on common issues of concern. The topic of conservation warrants a conference in its own right, but it was recognized that scientific findings can only emerge if there are subjects to study. A potential challenge for all great-ape field- workers was how to achieve a balance between rescue efforts and efforts directed at environmental protection and preservation. The questions debated included how these efforts should dovetail with alternatives such as ecotourism, whether fieldworkers should divide their time in the field between applied and basic research, and how scarce resources should be apportioned. It was clear that there is no ideal strategy to pursue; a sensible ap- proach requires the recognition that each habitat coun- try poses a unique set of problems and solutions. SPECIES OVERVIEWS Although the chimpanzee is the best-known species of great ape, our understanding of the bonobo, the gorilla, and the orangutan continues to grow. The orangutan of Borneo and Sumatra remains enigmatic. Van Schaik noted that despite decades of study, this Asian species still provokes many questions. How large and stable are the ranges of solitary males? Given the spatial distribu- tion of adults, can one speak of some form of commu- nity? He reviewed two models of the orangutan's social system: the "roving male" promiscuity model and the societal model that assumes differentiated male-female relationships. Adult females can be characterized as soli- 3.

Parous females especially resist mating with some males, and understanding this robust female choice will in van Schaik's view help determine which of the two proposed models best explains the orang- utan's social system. Watts gave an overview of comparative gorilla socio- ecology but dealt much more with the ecology of female social relationships and of female dispersal. He drew heavily on mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) but also extended his analyses of female transfer to colo- bine monkeys and gregarious equids. Female-female re- lations were typified by little physical association and few affinitive interactions unless the individuals were genetically related. Watts also discussed the relative costs and benefits to both males and females of being part of a one-male or a multimale silverback group. The social system of bonobos is of substantial interest to students of great apes, since the bonobo and the chim- panzee constitute the only genus with two species. How does P. paniscus compare with P. troglodytes? Bonobos are found only in Zaire, and only two research sites pro- vide the long-term data to address this question. White described intersite differences for bonobos and interspe- cies differences from chimpanzees. For the former, it may be that different methods accounted for behavioral dif- ferences; one site (Wamba) provisioned the apes with sugarcane, thereby increasing observational access, while the other study site (Lomako) did not provision and had less-habituated subjects. Might variation in af- filiative patterns and party size be accounted for by these methods? Interestingly, at Lomako the pattern of fis- sion-fusion that is seen for chimpanzees is also apparent, but at Wamba there is little of this behavior. White in- terpreted species differences in female bonding, more fre- quent among bonobos, as attributable to reduced feeding competition. SOCIAL ECOLOGY As noted above, van Schaik, Watts, and White clearly incorporated social ecology into their analyses, but four other participants particularly emphasized this ap- proach. Tutin in Gabon, Kuroda in Congo, and Yama- giwa in Zaire examined within- and between-species diet, ranging, and social structure for sympatric populations of gorillas and chimpanzees, while Wrangham dealt with chimpanzee diet and ranging and its impact on group structure in Uganda. For the three sympatric field sites, variation was the underlying theme. For example, lowland gorillas in all three sites were much more frugivorous than their bet- ter-known subspecific counterpart, the mountain go- rilla, and their home and day ranges were much larger as well. Encounters between groups of gorillas appeared to have more to do with feeding competition than with female transfer, as male displays and fighting between silverbacks were rare. However, the dissolution of a go- rilla group at Lop6, Gabon, is attributed to the death of the silverback, Porthos, from I6 deep puncture wounds presumed to have been inflicted by another silverback (Tutin and Fernandez I993). At Kahuzi, in Zaire, Yama- giwa studied four gorilla groups and a chimpanzee com- munity and noted extensive overlap of home ranges dur- ing the dry season and large overlap in plant foods but interspecific tolerance when the two species encoun- tered each other at the same fruiting trees. Yamagiwa suggested that this lack of agonism might be due to di- vergent feeding strategies reflecting group social struc- ture. Gorillas lived in cohesive groups that fed periodi- cally and for a short time at fruit trees, while chimpanzees ranged individually and made repeated vis- its to the resource. Kuroda, at Ndoki in Congo, also saw great overlap in some aspects of diet and differences in feeding strategies but clear niche separation for protein and mineral consumption by the two species. Swamp forest, which comprised 2o% of the study site, provided much terrestrial herbaceous vegetation that gorillas ac- tively sought, but chimpanzees rarely entered the swamp to forage. The terrestrial-herbaceous-vegetation (THV) hypothe- sis, in which this type of vegetation is viewed as fallback food that reduces feeding competition, was the focus of Wrangham's work with chimpanzees at Kibale in Uganda. The role of this type of vegetation in bonobo, chimpanzee, and gorilla diets was keenly debated, and after lengthy discussion Wrangham offered a revised per- spective in which what he described as low-quality and high-quality terrestrial herbaceous vegetation might have different impacts on feeding strategies. Given the importance of frugivory in chimpanzees, Wrangham also suggested a link between the scarcity of fruits other than figs for six to eight months per year and some as- pects of reproduction. An unexplained finding for Ki- bale's chimpanzees is a low reproductive rate with a mean birth interval of 7.2 years, the longest reported for wild chimpanzees. SOCIAL RELATIONS The social lives of apes may be studied from many angles-some primatologists choose to focus on one sex, others look at how rank and reproduction intersect, and still others examine how party size and composition may vary seasonally and over many years of study. Boesch took the last of the approaches in considering how chimpanzees in Tai Forest, Ivory Coast, differ from other long-studied populations in Tanzania and else- where. He assumed that overall community size was important for understanding the pattern of fission-fusion seen in chimpanzees and that smaller communities were less fluid in general. His means of determining party size engendered much methodological discussion, with the key variable being visibility. Boesch noted that when Tai was compared with other chimpanzee popula- tions mixed parties (adults of both sexes plus offspring) were the largest and that Tai chimpanzees had stronger intersexual bonds. He also presented sobering demo- graphic data for the main study community, which had</page><page sequence="4">Volume 37, Number i, February I996| I45 fallen from a high of 79 to some 40 individuals. (Num- bers have dropped further because of an epidemic of Ebola virus in the chimpanzee community.) Nishida concentrated on the politics of male chim- panzees and the complexities of shifting support in tri- adic relationships. In the course of decades of study of the Mahale population, he has documented the ethno- graphic background for these male-male coalitions. He has scrutinized confrontations, alliances, and associa- tion strategies for all adult males but paid close atten- tion to the three highest-ranking ones. The gamma male used opportunistic coalition tactics, changing sides whenever it was to his advantage. In contrast to the situ- ation with some captive populations, Mahale's females did not intervene in and had almost no influence on male-male confrontations. Bonobos are renowned for the varied sexual behavior shown by all age/sex-classes. Kano considered only ma- ture copulations, that is, heterosexual matings, of the bonobos at Wamba and found more male-male competi- tion than had been previously reported. Takahata's pre- circulated paper (not delivered because he was unable to attend) focused on heterosexual mating in bonobos but also offered a comparison with chimpanzees. In it he suggested that the two species are more alike in copula- tions than the other aspects of sexual behavior in bo- nobos would lead one to expect. Using Beach's (1976) model, he noted that since female bonobos have pro- longed estrus, which may result in increased receptivity, they show less competition for males than female chim- panzees, which show higher rates of proceptive behav- ior. INTELLECT Examining how a great ape solves problems, whether these be the demands of foraging or the complexities of interpersonal relations, is a challenging task, and the topic, sparked a lively discussion on the use (and abuse) of anthropomorphism. De Waal suggested that conflict and its resolution among anthropoid primates was a rich domain to explore. In champanzees, he noted, such rela- tionships reflected past and present interactions; they encompassed mother-infant weaning struggles, male- male competitive or coalitional behavior, etc. Hemelrijk took a very different position: She held that too much cognitive complexity was attributed to the chimpanzee and that many of these inferences of social intelligence were reducible to simpler rules of interaction. To dem- onstrate her more parsimonious perspective, she used computer modeling of primate dominance and prosocial behavior. Matsuzawa described laboratory research on symbol use by chimpanzees (especially a female named Ai) us- ing lexigrams, kanji characters, and Arabic numerals as well as field research at Bossou, Guinea, focused on both spontaneous tool use and naturalistic field experiments. He characterized his approach as comparative cognitive science, the goal being to understand human cognition from an evolutionary perspective. He argued that chim- panzee complex-pattern recognition was hierarchical and might be similar to that of humans. He suggested a parallel between chimpanzees' learning to construct visual symbols from basic elements called graphemes and the levels of phoneme, word, and phrase in human language. In his analysis of nut cracking by wild chim- panzees using stone hammers and anvils, he compared what laboratory chimpanzees do with visual symbols, what Bossou chimpanzees do with objects in tool use, and patterns of social relationships among chimpanzees. He employed a tree-structure analysis of hierarchical cognitive processes in which the elements, whether nuts, tools, lexigrams, mother, opponents, or other things, are identified as targets and then connected by temporal order; a connection between two targets is a node and the level of complexity is quantified by the number of nodes. Although better-known for her language research with captive chimpanzees and bonobos, Savage-Rumbaugh chose to present results from her first fieldwork with wild bonobos at Wamba. Using simulations of apparent botanical artifacts left by bonobos, she argued that there was suggestive (if not conclusive) evidence that bonobos used bent or broken twigs and leaves as signals to inform other bonobos that came after them in the forest of the direction they had traveled. This caused much discus- sion among long-term fieldworkers and produced a num- ber of suggestions as to what kinds of further data would be needed to convince skeptics of her claims. APE UNIVERSALS? Given that great apes are a relatively small, young radia- tion, can we speak of an "apeness" that characterizes all four species? Fruth summarized an exhaustive review of nest building and concluded that in many respects- including morphology, selectivity of material, ontogeny of the behavior-it is notably uniform across many lev- els of interspecific comparison. She suggested that nests evolved as a feeding adaptation, with the construction of the "proto-nest" consisting of bending in branches bearing sought-after fruits, etc., giving selective advan- tages to ancestral Miocene apes. Fruth also maintained that nest construction was the original form of tool use that laid the foundation for all later environmental ma- nipulation by hominoids. Doran analyzed positional behavior in the three Afri- can species of great apes and found that despite size dif- ferences within and between species these apes were similar in overall locomotor, postural, and positional be- havior. She showed females to be more arboreal and sug- gested that this sex difference in behavior might be use- ful in interpreting the fossil record of extinct hominoids. Climbing rather than arm-hanging might, she suggested, be the most powerful shaper of African ape upper-limb anatomy. She reiterated Fleagle et al.'s (i98i) view that this structure was coupled in early hominids with a hind limb that was morphologically and functionally pre- adapted for bipedal stance and locomotion. Mitani, who has studied vocalization in all four spe-</page><page sequence="5">I46 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY cies of great apes, discussed comparative studies of the three African species but focused especially on chimpan- zees (P. t. schweinfurthii) and mountain gorillas (G. g. beringei). He noted close correspondences in the acous- tic structure of calls, signal repertoires, and uses of vocal signals in the three species. However, he also found within-species differences (e.g., adult male chimpanzees call more often than do other age/sex-classes) and be- tween-species differences (e.g., gorillas vocalize more of- ten than do chimpanzees, and their calls reflect their relatively stable social groups in that the calls are pre- dominantly short-range). He had previously found popu- lational differences in chimpanzee calls (Mitani et al. I992), and here he pursued the idea of volitional control of vocalizations by individuals. He suggested that a ro- bust theoretical framework was needed to interpret the vocal behavior of nonhuman primates. McGrew tackled the mushrooming data on handed- ness in great apes with a view to contrasting the ape and human conditions. Paucity of data was a problem for orangutans and bonobos, but in none of the four species was there convincing evidence of population-level later- ality as there is in Homo sapiens. However, when wild chimpanzees used tools (see, e.g., McGrew and Marchant I992) or gorillas engaged in complex food- processing (see, e.g., Byrne and Byrne i99I), strong indi- vidual hand preference emerged. A comprehensive new five-level model of increasing laterality was proposed to explain both the captive and wild data from great apes. MODELING OURSELVES As Moore noted, a long-standing rationale in research grant proposals for studying great apes is the apes' poten- tial as referential or conceptual models of early homi- nids. Indeed, with finer resolution of the molecular evi- dence of hominoid evolution, it is clear that apes, and especially the genus Pan, are the obvious candidates upon which to model human evolution. The molecular, morphological, and behavioral data from great apes sup- ply us with a wealth of heuristic ideas that cannot be extracted from the paleontological evidence of human origins. But Moore and Zihlman focused on Pan in their discussions, Moore paying special attention to savanna- living chimpanzees and their use as a referential model for the last common ancestor while Zihlman empha- sized the use of bonobos in reconstructions of human evolution. Moore stressed the variability in what is im- plied by the term "model" and reviewed the types of models (e.g., analogical/referential, conceptual/strategic, etc.) that had been applied to human-origins research. He developed a set of questions that might be usefully addressed to a model that focused on savanna chimpan- zees. Given the known variation of chimpanzees in dif- ferent habitats and the presumed habitat of the last com- mon ancestor. Moore argued that examination of the adaptations of savanna chimpanzees in contrast to for- est-dwelling chimpanzees could yield important in- sights into the process of hominization. Zihlman took a historical approach in discussing how apes became incorporated into human-origins research and reconstruction. For her, the best reconstruction was the one that used all the available lines of evidence- comparative anatomy and behavior, the paleontological record, etc.-but ultimately the molecular data provided the limits or constraints. Focus on single traits was not helpful unless they could be integrated into a compre- hensive account. She returned to the pygmy chimpanzee model (Zihlman et al. I978) as a pioneering effort at using genus Pan as a critical source of data for consider- ing the last common ancestor. Given the recent descrip- tion of Australopithecus ramidus at 4.4 million years B.P. (White, Sua, and Asfaw I994) and its apparent dental affinities to P. paniscus, the discussion seemed particu- larly apt. SITE REPORTS Field data accumulate slowly, and research questions may change with personnel. As-yet-unpublished find- ings often shed light on related topics being pursued by other scientists. To facilitate the exchange of practical information, such as conservation efforts, and to outline the current research direction of the various research programs, two sessions were devoted to updating the status of the field sites where many of the researchers collect their data.4 Because great apes are long-lived (some individuals have been estimated to be in their fifth decade at death), group history is ongoing, and some matrilines of chimpanzees have produced four genera- tions of subjects for study. With advances in theory and technique, new questions emerge; longitudinal records or biological material collected earlier may provide un- tapped resources. The first session dealt with five long-term sites. At Gombe, Tanzania, Goodall reported demographic and political changes (e.g., changes in the alpha male posi- tion) in the Kasakela chimpanzee (P. t. schweinfurthii) community on which research began in I960. Nishida spoke of chimpanzee (P. t. schweinfurthii) research at the Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania, approx- imately i 6o km south of Gombe and also bordering Lake Tanganyika; this site has also entered its fourth decade of research effort. Watts reported on Karisoke, Rwanda, where records on mountain gorillas (G. g. beringei) be- gan in I967; researchers struggle to continue the work despite the human political tragedy of life and death in this East African nation. Fruth discussed the bonobo (P. paniscus) site of Lomako, Zaire, where American re- searchers first worked in I974 and Fruth and Hohmann have been conducting research since I990, achieving ha- bituation without the complications of provisioning. Matsuzawa reviewed research at Bossou, Guinea, where 4. In Great Ape Societies, the book of the conference, standardized reports on I 8 sites will appear, including the Ketambe and Suaq Balimbing sites for Sumatran orangutans, as well as Pan laboratory and zoo research centers in Holland, Japan, and the U.S.A.</page><page sequence="6">Volume 37, Number i, February I996 1 I47 a small, isolated community of chimpanzees (P. t. verus) has been studied intermittently since I976. The second session on site reports represented the "next generation" of great-ape field research. None of these sites had been developed at the time of the first conference, and several are sites with sympatric gorillas and chimpanzees. Tutin spoke on Lope, Gabon, where western lowland gorillas (G. g. gorilla) and central west- ern chimpanzees (P. t. troglodytes) are being studied; Kuroda discussed Ndoki, Congo, where gorillas (G. g. gorilla) and chimpanzees (P. t. troglodytes) are also be- ing studied; and Yamagiwa described work at Kahuzi- Biega, Zaire, which has eastern lowland gorillas (G. g. graueri) and eastern chimpanzees (P. t. schweinfurthii). Two chimpanzee sites and a bonobo site completed the survey, with Boesch detailing work at Tai, Ivory Coast, on chimpanzees (P. t. verus), Wrangham discussing chimpanzee (P. t. schweinfurthii) research at Kibale, Uganda, and Kano reporting on the other bonobo (P. pan- iscus) site at Wamba, Zaire. During site reports and informal evening meetings, videotapes were shown so that researchers could share the qualitative imagery of field sites and laboratory set- tings. Video clips illustrated specific behavioral pat- terns, for example, chimpanzees cracking nuts at Bossou or gorillas foraging in swamp habitat in Ndoki. Video also captured rare but dramatic events such as infanti- cide by male chimpanzees at Mahale. A book of 2I chapters by the conference participants with a foreword by Jane Goodall and an afterword by Junichiro Itani is in press with Cambridge University Press, to be published in August I996. Edited by W. C. McGrew, Linda F. Marchant, and Toshisada Nishida, it is titled Great Ape Societies. References Cited BEACH, F. A. I976.
