Because of limitations of space, we cannot guarantee to print all letters received. - Editor Hannah Arendt, in her article "Man's Con- quest of Space" [AS: Autumn, 1963], gives the astronaut, shot into outer space, as the symbolic incarnation of Heisenberg's man. He is a per- son completely shielded by his instrument-laden capsule from physical contact with his sur- roundings. I can think of another illustration. It appears in the advertisement of a quality-paper com- pany. The advertisement wants to impress on us the importance of knowledge (hence of books, hence of paper) by telling us that the Nautilus, in her first sub-ice-cap Polar expedi- tion, carried a library of over two thousand volumes. And, moreover, "eight men who were studying for advanced courses received certifi- cates of completion at the very moment the Nautilus passed under the Pole." These extreme examples of our alienation from the nonhuman environment appear to contrast sharply with what we read of Polar ex- peditions in former days. Consider, for instance, Robert Peary's race to the North Pole against the threat of full moon and ice breakage in 1909. Yet, Peary was not after physical en- counter with nature. His motivation in fact was entirely abstract and human, namely, to be the first person to reach a certain geometrical point on the earth's surface.

Dorothy Kirk Des Moines, Iowa It took over one hundred years for Coperni- cus' heliocentric theory of the universe to effect the changes in man's conceptual framework that necessarily arose from its adoption. Part of the reason for this long passage of time is that Copernicus wrote in highly technical language accessible only to trained astronomers. We are in a similar situation today, except that Copernicus was obscure by choice, whereas the modern physicist is obscure by necessity. Yet it seems to me that the difficulties attendant upon our understanding of the results of mod- ern physics should not be an insuperable bar- rier to our understanding of how the physicist gets these results. This is the area where our conceptual framework needs to be rebuilt. Miss Arendt, in "Man's Conquest of Space," asserts that this widening of our conceptual framework will be impossible to attain. The basis of her thesis is that the physicists, in search- ing for the reality behind the appearance of things, have gone beyond sense data and dis- carded human common sense - hence causality and language - in favor of chance and mathe- matical terminology. I purposely simplify her case, in order to make this point: for the "lay- man and the humanist to sit in judgment over what the scientist is doing," they must first un- derstand what it is they are judging. To impute to practicing scientists a kind of striving toward the elucidation of the real world behind ap- pearances, and to couple this with the assertion that the limits of human sense have been reached and passed beyond in scientific experi- ment, is to destroy any chance of understand- ing the method of science. It is obvious that Miss Arendt does not really appreciate the effect on science that its own dis- coveries have produced.

Part of the process is to gain knowledge of a material nature; the next step is the more difficult one of gaining knowl- edge of one's self. Home of Eta of Pennsylvania, Phi Beta Kappa 3ke Most CDisünquíske^ Mark in ÇjralernLty Jewelry OFFICIAL JEWELER TO PHI BETA KAPPA ATIIEBQRO, /^MASSACHUSETTS^ lution in physics, have led most scientists and philosophers of science to advocate a less abso- lute and more fruitful position about the for- mation of scientific theory than those pro- pounded by Aristotle, Bacon or Kant. The hypothetical-inductive method (Camp- bell et al.) is one variation of this modern posi- tion. Roughly, it states that a good scientific theory explains as many observational data as possible, and predicts several data of observa- tion that ought to be found by experiment. If these latter data are indeed observed, the theory is said to be confirmed. It will never be a "com- pellingly and demonstrably true statement." We may amass many data that add to the be- lievability of the theory, but a conclusion from any inductive process can never be "right": it can only be less likely to be wrong. The physicist has had to give up his search for reality, not because his senses have been passed over, but because they are all he has. I use "senses" to include the instruments with which most observational data are taken today. Now, Miss Arendt maintains that there is some- thing philosophically poisonous about using an instrument to obtain data, especially on a very large or vçry small scale. This may be due to the fact that she confuses "anthropomorphic" with "anthropocentric." Granted, an anthro- pocentric physics that conceived of an electron as having human desires and aspirations would probably be useless. But an instrument de- signed to characterize an electron, since it is an intricate and precise extension of one or two human senses, will necessarily be somewhat anthropomorphic in nature. A little thought will show that Miss Arendt 's poignant paradox of Heisenberg's man disap- pears on this view of things. Besides this, Heis- enberg's uncertainty principle is a consequence of one theory of physics and is fruitfully ap- plied only to systems of the order of magnitude of the electron, with which a future astronaut will presumably not be directly concerned. We are just passed the beginning of the atomic age. Logical positivism, operationism, and other philosophies of science are attempt- ing to explain the workings of scientific theory to the scientist and to the layman. It is impor- tant that the question that Miss Arendt raises be answered. It is equally important that the question be asked in the right way. Metaphysical specters have been chased out of the laboratory. It is high time they were chased out of the learned journals as well. Theodora T. Kalikow New York, New York IOS</page></plain_text>
