<plain_text><page sequence="1">In the Realm of Ambivalence: Alexander von Humboldt's Discourse on Cuba (Relation historique du Voyage auxRegions equinoxiales du Nouveau Continent) Oliver Lubrich Freie Universitat Berlin Autobiographies, diaries, travelogues, and other such texts alleged to be "non- fictional" do not encourage readings that are neither biographical nor historical. The reception of Alexander von Humboldt, in particular, revolved more around his person than around his work. His oeuvre has been examined extensively from many perspectives, but he has rarely been the subject of literary criticism. Humboldt has been regarded-and read-as an adventurer and a scientist, a politician and an historian, an observer of "otherness" and a point of reference in the formation of national identities. He is hardly ever read as a literary author. Humboldt's essay on Cuba proves to be no exception to this phenomenon. Published separately as Essai politique sur l'ile de Cuba1 and also as a longer segment in the three-volume Relation historique du Voyage aux Regions equinoxiales du Nouveau Continent, it has only been understood in the unliterary way that is typical for the reception of Humboldt's work.2 Alexander von Humboldt's visit to Cuba and his Cuban essay were met-for obvious reasons-with much interest from the islanders themselves3: Alexander von Humboldt has been immensely important for Cuba's collective imagination and its intellectual discourse,4 for its national history5 as well as its contemporary popular culture. Cuba remembers Humboldt as its "Second Discoverer,"6 an activist for national independence, a partisan of the social revolution, and even as a reference point for the development of a Cuban identity.7 Humboldt's milestones (1769 birth- 1799 beginning of his journey to America, 1801 and 1804 sojourns in Havana- 1859 death) are commemorated by Cuba's cultural administration8 and also reenacted by Germany's cultural diplomacy.9 In my own discussion I will focus as closely as possible on Humboldt's text. To understand his writings on Cuba as literature, it seems appropriate to look at the Essai politique sur I'ile de Cuba as a passage within the context of the Relation historique du Voyage aux Regions equinoxiales du Nouveau Continent- not as an 1</page><page sequence="2">German Studies Review 26/1 (2003) isolated work.?1 Besides his Essay on Mexico1 the Essai politique on Cuba is Humboldt's only monographic study of a Spanish colony in America. Studying Humboldt's Cuba as an exemplary case will help us understand his confrontation with Latin America. My general interest is: How does Alexander von Humboldt perceive Cuba? More precisely, how does he describe Cuba literarily? Which role does Cuba play within the American travelogue? In detail, the pursuit of four specific questions is particularly worthwhile: (1) How does Humboldt develop the storyline of his approaching Cuba's shore? (2) How does he stage his arrival in Havana? (3) How does his terminology change over the course of his sojourn on the island? (How is the island coded and recoded in the text?) (4) What is Cuba's symbolic topography in the context of the American travelogue and in Alexander von Humboldt's geographic imagination? 1. Approach The Cuban sections of the Humboldtian travelogue, the main part of which forms the Essaipolitique, do not appear to have been conceived as a coherent entity. They are structured in a markedly heterogeneous manner with no underlying, consistent structure.12 In terms of genre poetics, Humboldt's Cuban corpus varies between descriptive travel narrative, scientific geography, and sociopolitical essayism.1 When it thematizes Cuba, Humboldt's text undergoes a strange semantic dissemination. Beginning with the delineation of his travels from Nueva Barcelona to Havana (III, 322-30), while Humboldt is spatially and thematically approaching Cuba, a number of seemingly unimportant, yet, in fact, significant descriptions emerge. The subtext of these descriptions spells out peculiarly disconcerted modes of perception, such as deceptive visual effects of proximity during the sea voyage ("...me fait croire que l'eloignement de l'ile etoit moins grand que nous ne le supposames." [III, 323]), and optical illusions in size ("Les rochers [...] paroissoient beaucoup plus eleves qu'ils ne le sont effectivement" [III, 324]). Accompanying the portrayal of the ship entering offshore waters are two simultaneous sensual experiences that contradict one another: an intolerable stench prevails on deck ("l'odeur de la viande seche, dont le navire etoit charge, devenoit encore plus insupportable." [III, 329]), while pleasant scents signal the island's proximity ("la proximite de l'ile de Cuba s'annonqoit par une delicieuse odeur aromatique." [III, 330]).14 What will later become the leitmotif of Humboldt's representations of Cuba is introduced right from the start: polysemy - the loss of singular, unequivocal perception. The sequence of the approximation to Cuba follows a series of thematic phases: scientific measurements and cartography, smells, sighting the island, entering into the port, and viewing Havana. This section creates a dramaturgy through climactic and anti-climactic effects and plays with the creation, suspension, and disillusionment of artfully evoked expectations. Compositionally, a retardant moment of the 64</page><page sequence="3">Oliver Lubrich passage (III, 322-330) precedes its exciting climax built up around of the ship's arrival (III, 330). The mise-en-scene of this climax, however, is postponed by a set of truly undramatic statistics on the population of the Antilles (III, 330-44), after which the boat finally enters the port (III, 348). Stylistically, Humboldt concludes his long, suspenseful report of the sea voyage, which is depicted with linguistic complexity, with a dry statement pronounced in the lapidary tone of an utterly uninterested chronicler: "Nous mouillames dans le port de la Havane, le 19 d6cembre, apres vingt-cinqjours de navigation par un temps constamment mauvais." (III, 330). 2. Arrival The record of Humboldt's arrival in Havana is a small literary masterpiece in its own right. The traveler describes how the ship he boarded in Venezuela approaches the coast, how it enters the bay and the port, and how he leaves the boat and walks into the city. This short passage lends itself to a double reading on the Cuban capital. Humboldt notices first: L'aspect de la Havane, a l'entree du port, est un des plus rians et des plus pittoresques dont on puisse juir sur le littoral de l'Amerique equinoxiale, au nord de l'equateur. (III, 348) One page further we read: A l'epoque de mon sejour, peu de villes de l'Amerique espagnole offroient, par le manque d'une bonne police, un aspect plus hideux. (III, 349) In the original pagination of the Relation historique, these opposing judgments share a double page (III, 348-49), each printed in the bottom third of the two pages, facing each other directly on the exact same height.15 How can two such different evaluations be so evidently juxtaposed? How can we explain the contrast between the first euphoric perception and the second unpleasant one? Is Humboldt addressing two different aspects of the same city? Did he change his mind? Or did he lose control over his text?'6 Humboldt's evaluation of Havana's beauty (as he sees it from the ship) functions according to an aesthetics of hybridity: Havana is at the same time strange to him (since he is visiting the city for the first time) and familiar (its "European" and "Spanish-colonial" qualities are aspects he is well acquainted with). Humboldt positions Cuba's capital in a semidistant twilight zone. Its inherent contrasts seem to attract the traveler. Opposites that coexist, the picturesque combination of strangeness and familiarity, "the foreign" in "the familiar" and "the familiar" in "the foreign"-all of this pleases him: the island is hybrid, located between two worlds.17 Humboldt later describes palm trees in Havana's suburbs as botanical 65</page><page sequence="4">German Studies Review 26/1 (2003) symbols of this "contrast": He interprets them as plants that unite tenderness ("tendre") and raggedness ("fendille"), as columns ("colonnes ") which connect the earth with the sky ("qui montent droit vers le ciel") (III, 350). Humboldt's initial description proceeds in two phases. As though he were using a static panoramic lens, he forms an impressionist image only to give way gradually to a consecutive narration. Now his perspective is that of a dynamic "camera eye" movement. The eye of the viewer has become increasingly flexible. The traveler locates the bay from the ship and then, from within the town, sees solid houses, unpaved roads, and narrow streets.18 At first the contradiction (or correction) of the traveler's positive first impression by his negative second judgment appears to be a conflict between the view from outside and from within, between remote perception and the effect of proximity, or between a general impression and a detailed viewing. From the distance of the nearing ship, Havana appears to be beautiful, "pittoresque" (III, 348), literally "like a painting." This abstract, in the true sense of the word "theoretical" panopsis idealizes Havana, but is immediately rectified by a concrete, "practical" experience. The nearing of the pedestrian implies a loss of aesthetic distance. He can no longer behold it panoptically. Instead, his perspective is immediate and his contact with the city direct and physical. What was once "picturesque" has now become disgusting, "hideux" (III, 349). Whereas from an aesthetic distance, the visual sense has been privileged, in the streets the "low" senses now become activated: the adjective "hideux" sets off a process of becoming disgusted which then initiates a haptical-olfactorial synaesthetics of mud, tightness, and stench (III, 349-51). The city now comes to be associated with dirt and disease (III, 359-60).19 Moving from the stinking smells on board his boat to the sweet smells of the-as of yet still invisible-island and the wonderful view of the bay, Humboldt's perception reaches its absolute low point inside the city. By going ashore, the traveler's view transforms ideal beauty into intolerable ugliness, or even disgust. Each evaluation that Humboldt makes seems to be determined by the relationship he perceives between nature and culture: Nature that shows signs of being cultivated he perceives as pleasant; culture in which nature inadequately spreads, as unpleasant. From this school of thought, Humboldt allegorizes a deserted building-project, where tree-trunks which were meant to serve as a strongholds rot in the mud instead (III, 349). Natural beauty seems to be senselessly wasted in Havana instead of being cultivated appropriately for civilized purposes. Humboldt criticizes the city's apparently bad urban planning and notes suggestions for practical improvements. Generally, Humboldt's verdict on the city of Havana is accounted for in terms of unpoetic pragmatism. Alejo Carpentier uses it as a starting point for his essay on the structure and architecture of Havana, La ciudad de las columnas.20 In his short text, Carpentier interprets the stylistic peculiarities of the Cuban capital. He corrects Humboldt's misunderstandings of the "bad road planning" in the old 66</page><page sequence="5">Oliver Lubrich center (la Havana Vieja) and provides explanations for various features. What characterises Havana's style, so Carpentier's basic thesis goes, is the creation of shade in the tropical sun.21 Carpentier focuses on five elements: (1) he argues that the apparently unmethodical structure of the old center is actually a complex game of light and shade which has developed into a specific colonial-tropical style; (2) he compares the abundance of columns of all styles to an endless labyrinth of arcades and colonnades, which enable flaneurs to move through the city without leaving the shade; (3) the complex metal decoration on windows, portals, stones, lamps, and portable walls, according to Carpentier, are light and air-permeable demarcations of living areas, and, at the same time, help to create more shade; (4) the multicolored semicircular windows above doors and patios he interprets as ways to refract, reject, and color incoming sunlight; (5) the "mampara" - originally a wooden screen with a fabric covering, later a wooden interior or intermediate door with window-panes and pictorial motives, which were initially used as separations in the yard configuring domestic life and ways of communication-Carpentier reads as the "heraldry" and even the "ethics" of a house.22 Carpentier's wording, and particularly his use of the heraldic metaphor, interpret Havana's stylistic characteristics as central elements of an emerging cultural identity. All in all Cuban style, as Carpentier has defended it, now gives the impression of having a purposeful structure developed by the genius loci and by specific forms of transculturation. Carpentier unveils order behind apparent disorder, which only "superficial" beholders such as Humboldt can overlook. Carpentier casts Alexander von Humboldt's Essai as a fundamental "misreading" of Havana's architecture and urbanism, and claims that it reveals little other than Humboldt's lack of understanding of Latin American reality. While critical voices like that of Alejo Carpentier were rare in Cuba,23 Humboldt's Mexican essay caused much controversy in Mexico.24 Whereas Carpentier identified and corrected one of Humboldt's alleged misunderstandings, Juan Ortega y Medina launched a direct attack in the introduction to the Mexican edition of the Essai politique sur le Royaume de la Nouvelle Espagne, to account for Humboldt's misperceptions. Carpentier claims that Humboldt failed to understand the inherent logic of a specific mestizo form of "baroque," a "barroquismo peculiar" in Havana's style.25 Ortega y Medina argues that Alexander von Humboldt was uninterested in and oblivious to baroque style, which had been flourishing in Latin America long before his visit.26 Indeed, the baroque may be Humboldt's cultural-historical blind spot.27 Humboldt perceived South American nature, above all the rain forest, as a chaotic, sensual plentitude, containing an omnipresence of wild, virgin life that would aesthetically be compatible with "baroque" features.28 On the other hand, Humboldt views American civilization from a "classicist" perspective and describes cities in Venezuela within the paradigm of "classicist" aesthetics. These cities were built on orthogonal, rational, and regular principles, and, as becomes evident when Humboldt describes the port of Havana, they 67</page><page sequence="6">German Studies Review 26/1 (2003) attractively and tastefully balanced natural and artificial elements. Humboldt is indeed incapable, as Carpentier and Ortega y Medina point out, of comprehending Havana's superficially chaotic, but underlying "baroque" structure, and its special mode of cultural expression and representation. However, the disputed doubly coded passage does not necessarily reflect a specific deficiency of Humboldt's. It seems to contain a subtle rhetorical strategy with an implicit (and quite ironic) poetology. Reevaluating Havana, casting aside idealized preconceptions over the course of his arrival, and repealing classical models of aestheticizations inside the city alludes to a basic feature of travel literature, which Humboldt himself had practiced and analyzed self-reflexively in the previous 1682 pages of his Relation historique: The reality he encounters over the course of his travels challenges the Eurocentric conceptions that he had brought with him. What he idealizes by resorting to abstract aesthetic codes from a distance, proves, on second glance, quite contradictory. This passage is significant not only in this implicitly poetological, self- referential sense, but also in terms of composition: The transition from euphoric to pejorative observations does not end in the slums of the old center. Humboldt perceives Havana first from a distance, then he approaches and enters the city, and feels its ugliness - and he distances himself from the city again, regaining a central perspective: "II y a," Humboldt exclaims, "deux belles promenades..." (III, 350), which lead him out of the smelly labyrinth. But instead of closing with a harmonious ending, the narration culminates here in its most intense moment of devaluation: Humboldt observes an open-air sale of African slaves (III, 350). Structurally, then, the antiaesthetic setting of dirt and stench is a backdrop against which Humboldt morally condemns slave trading. His literary representation of the instinctively repulsive old center sets the scene for a social, political, and ethical condemnation (of slavery)-more than an urbanistic, art-historical, or hygienic critique (of the city). Read with this political subtext in mind, it is no coincidence that Humboldt articulates his positive assessment of Havana in geographical terms - "L' aspect... est un plus rians... de 'Ame'rique equinoxiale" - and frames his negative evaluation with a set of colonial references-"...peu de villes de l'Amerique espagnole offroient... un aspect plus hideux." Poetically read, what disgusts Humboldt about Havana is not its dirty streets but its custom of slavery. Already in its opening sequence, the Cuban text sets a political tenor, and later elaborates on it further. It will reach its climax in the final section labeled "essay on slavery." Formally, the Essaipolitique is a discursive hybrid of narration, science, and essayism. Its content is arranged in a ring composition constructed around an aesthetic-moral condemnation of slavery at the center of which lies its socioeconomic analysis.2 68</page><page sequence="7">Oliver Lubrich 3. Terminology The first impression of Cuba and its capital, which had been introduced by contrasting motifs during the passage discussed earlier, is thus dual and contradictory. Beauty and ugliness merge with one another and set the tone of ambivalence which will dominate the text. Poetologically and compositionally, as well as on the level of content and semantics, Humboldt uses these initial ambiguities to establish the central topic of his description: the Cuban island and its culture and civilization become ambivalent-and with it Humboldt's language and terminology. The traveler who is going ashore identifies a fundamental ambivalence within Cuba's colonialism: The two beautiful promenades ("deux belles promenades") mentioned earlier, a theater ("le theatre dont l'interieur a ete decore en 1803 avec beaucoup de gout par un artiste italien"), and a botanical garden ("le jardin botanique") represent European culture; slave trade on the other hand ("un autre objet, dont l'aspect afflige et revolte a la fois: les baraques devant lesquelles sont exposes en vente les malheureux esclaves") stands for European crimes (III, 350).30 Colonialism's two-facedness, as is immediately evident to the newcomer in Cuba, is also inscribed in its official memorial culture: In the same spot where Humboldt observed the sale of human beings, a monument to Carlos III was later erected, as he deduced from subsequent research. Humboldt accentuates the significance of this location and the scene he witnessed by symbolically uniting on this spot the central figures of Spanish colonialism: the king, the discoverer, and the conqueror. Humboldt construes that originally this location was intended for the erection of a monument for Cristobal Colon, whose ashes had been brought to Cuba in the same year that the ashes of Herman Cortes were transferred to a new burial place in Mexico (III, 350).31 In this space, Eurocentric concepts and the optimistic idea of linear historical progress can no longer remain uncontested. Humboldt's terminology reflects how much the observations of colonialism in practice irritated his idealist philosophy of history. Throughout the entire Cuban text, the central terms of Alexander von Humboldt's philosophical arsenal become ambiguous as a result of his dramatic encounter with the slave economy. These Humboldtian ambiguities are rarely attributable to peculiar, personal, or idiosyncratic uses of language. Instead, the text takes advantage of the scope of meanings specific words already contain. Humboldt's Relation historique seems systematically to intersperse different lexical and semantic levels, so that "pre-text" and "sub-text" are no longer separable.32 Within two pages, for instance, Humboldt's formerly stable concept of "culture" becomes fundamentally ambivalent when he alternates between "culture intellectuelle" (III, 407) and "la culture du sol" (III, 408), culture based on slave labor. The term "colony" likewise undergoes a transition. It is no longer used to denote the specific imperial practice of territorial rule, but comes to signify human settlement in general, sometimes even settlement of African slaves, albeit against their will: Humboldt speaks of "une colonie africaine en Amerique" (III, 597). 69</page><page sequence="8">German Studies Review 26/1 (2003) In Cuba the basic vocabulary of the European Enlightenment is injected into an economic discourse and becomes charged with economic-liberal connotations: "droit," for example, no longer refers exclusively to a moral or legal "right" ("acquerir le droit de se dispenser" [III, 446]; "l'inegale repartition des droits et des jouissances de la vie" [III, 446]), but also designates "tax" and "fee" ("droits d'entr6e" [III, 422]), which are levied not only on material, but also on human "goods": "un droit de 6 piastres par chaque negre introduit dans l'ile" (III, 402). Following this pattern, the "liberal" dimension of the Humboldtian rhetoric becomes particularly fraught: The word "libre,"-"free," is employed both in the libertarian sense of liberty as a human right- and at the same time in the economic sense of the word, implying free trade. When brought into connection with slavery, this word is immensely provocative: "[L]e commerce des negres fut declare libre," today we would say: deregulated (III, 403). "Interet," likewise, no longer only signifies disinterested academic pursuit of knowledge, but its polar opposite as well: "revenue" on capital ("l'interet du capital" [III, 415])-or the political "pursuits" of the colonial power ("les interets politiques de la Peninsule" [III,428], "[les] interets generaux de la monarchie espagnole" [III, 445]).33 The boundaries between apparently indifferent perceptions of the "foreign" and the explicit "interests" of colonial and economic appropriation now have vanished. Aesthetic as well as philosophical and scientific concepts have been recoded. In Cuba "vue" is no longer only a beautiful prospect ("Vues des Cordilleres" [II, 319]), but now also a political opinion ("Don Francisco Arango, dont les vues ont toujours ete pleines de sagesse" [III, 402]).34 Even the notion of "tableau," which played a special role in Humboldt's aesthetic appreciation of nature,35 is both a poetic painting of scenic beauty and a profane statistical "table" ("ces tableaux que l'on publie" [III, 429])36 that counts and categorizes the Afro-Cuban population. Philosophical-aesthetic discourse and political-economic discourse have become one and the same. Throughout his travel narrative, Humboldt metaphorizes "the other" by implementing a series of modes, each of which is inherently consistent and lends an additional poetic dimension to the text without complicating it rhetorically.37 In Cuba, however, ambiguity dominates the tone of the text. Humboldt plays out different metaphorical dimensions against each other and thus causes complex tensions between distinct areas of discourse: philosophy, aesthetics, and science on one side, and economics and politics on the other. As a result, this poetics is irritating and deconstructive. In the Cuban passages of his American travelogue, Alexander von Humboldt opens up a semantic field, where two diverging tendencies of the European Enlightenment conflict. The humanist philosophy of history does not seem to be a valid concept in Cuba where colonial customs rule and neocolonial forms of economic exploitation already appear. This irritation of Humboldt's ideology can be detected linguistically in the radical ambivalence of his text. 70</page><page sequence="9">Oliver Lubrich Humboldt almost seems to lose control over his own discourse. The Humboldtian rhetoric deconstructs itself. Whether this is intentional, remains open: Are Humboldt's Cuban ambiguities intended as literary strategies or are they the unconscious results of unanswered questions? Is there a subtle strategy in the persistence of ambivalence in the Humboldtian rhetoric, or does it merely reveal the difficulty Humboldt has in coming to terms with Cuban reality? Does it function as self-deconstruction, or does it unconsciously present contradictions and paradoxes out of what cannot be integrated logically? In the so-called essay "on slavery" at the end of the Essaipolitique (III,445-58), the terms which have gained a technical-economic dimension are, at least partially, remoralized. Humboldt oscillates between idealist and realpolitical discourses on slavery and accordingly alternates between a moral (abolitionist) and an economic (legalistic-reformist) position. He articulates his criticism of slavery in a dual rhetoric: enlightened, humanist, and ethical, on the one hand, and careful, moderate, and pragmatic on the other. Humboldt's discourse on slavery negotiates between the parties of the slave-owners and those of the abolitionists (III, 336). He calls for a complete abolition of slavery, "le dernier but est la cessation de l'esclavage" (III, 448), yet by an evolutionary process, an "affranchissement progressif" (III, 341), through progressive reforms implemented from above and by consensual, concerted action, "l'action simultanee des hommes libres" (III, 448). Slavery here appears metaphorically as an illness to be treated medically ("remedier au mal" [III, 450])-not a symptom to be eradicated by surgery.38 Humboldt outlines a Janus- faced policy for slavery, which he legitimizes through a reference to Sim6n Bolivar and deems "humane" and "prudent" at once: "humaine et prudente a la fois" (III, 341).39 Alexander von Humboldt's Cuban records are concrete examples of what Homi Bhabha describes theoretically from a "post-colonial" standpoint as general phenomena: the hybridization of the colonial discourse, the ambivalence of the colonial signifier as a result of the contact with the colonies themselves.40 4. Topography Is there a relationship between the compositional, content-based, and linguistic ambiguities in Alexander von Humboldt's Cuban narrative and the symbolic function of Cuba in Humboldt's geographic imagination? Alexander von Humboldt's symbolic topography41 depicts Europe ("l'Ancien monde" [II, 200]) as a coherent space and place of origin that is subdivided into German, French, and Spanish areas, with no clear hierarchy among them. The Canary Islands are a first intermediate location, a prologue, and a Euro-American microcosm. The American journey encompasses five detailed phases, three of which are unique and clearly definable: The two stopovers in Cuba do not have a definite place in this structure. The phases can be summarized as follows: Venezuela (first phase), Cuba (first stopover), the Andean countries (second phase), Mexico (third phase), and again 71</page><page sequence="10">German Studies Review 26/1 (2003) Cuba (second stopover). Before returning to Europe, Humboldt spent a couple of weeks in the U.S.A., also an intermediate space between Europe and South America, which occupies a complementary position to the Canary Islands. The symmetrical structure of the composition begins to take a recognizable form: Humboldt's two sojourns on the Cuban island together add up to a little over three months: December 19, 1800, to March 15, 1801, and from March 19 to April 29, 1804. Both occasions were intermediate stops: first Humboldt was on his way from Venezuela to Colombia and the second time from Mexico to the United States. Within Humboldt's imaginary topography, Cuba is positioned in many regards as an "in-between" space: Havana stands symbolically between America and Europe: "La Havane [...] rivalise, par ses ouvrages, avec les places les plus importantes de l'Europe" (III, 407). Humboldt compares the size of the island to England (III, 346) and raises its urbanism to the ranks of international metropoles. Rich Cubans take journeys to Europe (III, 407). Humboldt even fictitiously connects Cuba's history and geography more closely with the old world than with the new ("cette apparence d'une inegalite de distance" [III, 407]): "[L]a Havane paroissoit dix fois plus rapprochee de l'Espagne que le Mexique, Caracas et la Nouvelle Grenade." (III, 407) For a travelogue that is meant to cover "strange" and "exotic" countries, Cuba is rather unspectacular. It is a part of the "other," but is not really "alien": Depuis que le perfectionnement de l'art du navigateur et l'activite croissante des peuples commergans ont rapproche les cotes des deux continens, depuis que la Havane, Rio Janeiro et le Senegal nous paroissent a peine plus eloignes que Cadix, Smyre et les ports de la Baltique, on hesite de fixer ' attention du lecteur sur un trajet des c6tes de Caracas a l'ile de Cuba. La Mer des Antilles est connue comme le bassin de la Mediterranee. (III, 322) In the history of the Spanish-American empire, Cuba's legal administration was exceptional in two ways: As a colony of second degree, Havana was administered by the Kingdom of New Spain (Mexico) for many years ("liees a la metropole mexicaine, alors colonie elle-meme de l'Europe" [III, 347]), and the island remained Spain's last possession in the West after the decolonization of South and Central America (III, 346). Both its wealth ("Cette ile est, de toutes les possessions de l'Espagne, celle qui a le plus prospere" [III, 347]) and its importance as an international commercial center ("le port de la Havane [...] s'est elevee au rang des premieres places du monde comer,ant." [III, 347]) distinguished it from other colonies. Within the Caribbean, Cuba is equally exceptional: Its long tradition of European settlement and strong national identity - though, surprisingly, considering that Cuba became independent much later than other colonies - distinguish it from the other islands and make it comparable to the nations of Europe.42 Havana, indeed, is metropole and colony. 72</page><page sequence="11">Oliver Lubrich In Humboldt's imaginary topography of America, Cuba plays a special role: it is a geographical frontier between North and South America, an imaginary link between America and Europe, a stopover from Venezuela to Colombia and from Mexico to the United States, a relatively cultivated region in comparison to the archaic landscapes of the Llanos, the rainforest, and the Orinoco, a place inside the "other" that is relatively "familiar," the first and last Spanish possession in America with a special political status between province, colony, and independent nation. Cuba is Humboldt's intermediate zone, a microcosm of his American journey, which presents diverse phenomena in a tense coexistence, bound to remain unresolved. Within the Relation historique, Cuba has many vital functions.43 Alexander von Humboldt's discourse is characterized by a number of specific ambiguities, which he delicately orchestrates in his various writings on Cuba-be it his Essaipolitique sur 1''le de Cuba or other passages in the travelogue. These ambiguities are subtly prepared by a subtext in Humboldt's passage on sea; they are introduced in the artfully crafted scene of his arrival in Havana; they are developed into a complex system of terms that have double meanings (aesthetic/philosophical and economic/ political), corresponding to a double-coded discourse on slavery; and they reflect Cuba's imagined topographical location.44 Cuba is the place where contradictions in Humboldt's American travelogue crystallize. Aesthetically, rhetorically, thematically, and in terms of symbolic topography, Cuba is Alexander von Humboldt's Realm of Ambivalence. 1Alexander von Humboldt, Essai politique sur l'Ile de Cuba (Paris, 1826). 2Alexander von Humboldt, Relation historique du Voyage aux Regions equinoxiales du Nouveau Continent.

The second stay in Cuba can barely be reconstructed from the remaining travel diaries, which contain detailed descriptions of most other portions of the journey: The originals are in the manuscript department, Staatsbibliothek Berlin (West). A typescript was created by the Alexander von Humboldt research center of the Academy of Sciences (former GDR).

In the German-speaking world the French original has been all but forgotten with the many translated editions: Ottmar Ette, "Von Surrogaten und Extrakten: Eine Geschichte der Ubersetzungen und Bearbeitungen des amerikanischen Reisewerks Alexander von Humboldts im deutschen Sprachraum," in: Karl Kohut/Dietrich Briesemeister/Gustav Siebenmann, eds., Deutsche in Lateinamerika -Lateinamerika in Deutschland (Frankfurt am Main, 1996), 98-126; see also: Irene Priifer Leske, "Ubersetzungen, Manipulation und Neuiibersetzung des Essai politique sur l'ile de Cuba Alexander von Humboldts," in: Ottmar Ette/Walther L. Bernecker, eds.,Ansichten Amerikas. Neuere Studien zu Alexander von Humboldt (Frankfurt am Main, 2001), 219-30. 1 Alexander von Humboldt, Essaipolitique sur le Royaume de la Nouvelle-Espagne (Paris, 1811). 12 The part of the travelogue on Humboldt's first stay in Cuba extends across chapters 27- 29 of vol. III: chapter 27 describes the passage from Cumana in Venezuela to Havana, 322- 44; chapter 28 contains the Essai politique sur l'Ile de Cuba, 345-458; after that, the narration on the journey continues, 458-83, followed by some "Notes," 484-501; chapter 29 covers Humboldt's departure from Cuba, his passage to Cartagena, and the beginning of his voyage in today's Colombia, 502-79; the volume closes with some scientific "additions" to the Cuban section, 580-627, and a "note supplementaire," 627-29, which, again, refers to Humboldt's journey through Colombia. '3Already before the description of the first stay in Cuba Havana appears in a strange analogy with Rio de Janeiro in a comparative view of regions at equal distance from the equator, around the two Tropics (III, 304). The island is mentioned twice before in relation to the size of the African slave population (III, 58, 66). Apart from the diaries and the Relation historique there are further scientific sections of Humboldt's American opus that refer to Cuba relating to newly discovered plants (Nova genera et species plantarum, 7 vol. [Paris, 1815-1826]), astronomical determinations of geographical positions (Recueil d'observations astronomiques, d'operations trigonometriques etde mesures barometriques, faites pendant le cours d'un voyage aux regions equinoxiales du Nouveau Continent, depuis 1799 jusqu'en 1803, 2 vol. [Paris 1808-1811]), and the geographical history or history of the discovery of the island (Examen critique de l'histoire de la geographie du Nouveau Continent et des progres de l'astronomie nautique aux quinzieme et seizieme siecles, 5 vol. [Paris 1836-1839]). 14Ottmar Ette reads the topos of the "sweet-smelling island" as a fictional restaging of Cristobal Colon's perception of Cuba: "'Si yo mintiese al igual que todos los cronistas de viajes,' Alejandro de Humboldt y Colomb," in: Holl, 61-74, here 65. Cf. Ette, "Entdecker iiber Entdecker: Alexander von Humboldt, Cristobal Colon und die Wiederentdeckung Amerikas," in: Titus Heydenreich, ed., Columbus zwischen zwei Welten.

He only quotes from the euphoric first description, in the paraphrase of a Cuban historian (Vidal Morales, in El Figaro 1897): Fernando Ortiz, "Introduccion biobibliografica," in: Alexander von Humboldt, Ensayo politico sobre la Isla de Cuba. Introduccion biobibliogrdfica de Fernando Ortiz. Correcciones, notas, apendices de Francisco Arango y Parreno, J. S. Thrasher y otros, ed. Daniel Garcia Santos (La Habana, 1998), XXVIII- XXIX. See also Miguel Barnet/Alberto Quesada, "Alejandro de Humboldt (1769-1859) y don Fernando Ortiz (1881-1969): dos sabios descubridores de Cuba," in: Holl, 75-82. Otto Olivera briefly registers the contradiction: "Humboldt, Alexander von. 'Essai politique sur l'ile de Cuba' (1807). 2 vols., Paris: Librairie de Gide Fils, 1826, XLVI-364 &amp; 408," in: Viajeros en Cuba (1800-1850) (Miami, 1998), 41-47. 16The arrival in a "new" country is one of the moments in a travelogue that can least be read as realistic renderings of facts. Arrivals are usually highly ritualized moments of the voyage, e.g., Humboldt's description of his arrival on the Canary Islands, in Cumana, etc.; or Georg Forster's famous report of his arrival in Tahiti; see Georg Forster, Reise um die Welt, ed. Gerhard Steiner (Frankfurt am Main, 1983), 241. 17The contrast as a topical mode of perception also plays a substantial role in the sections of the first volume of the travelogue, which describe Humboldt's arrival in Venezuela: Humboldt develops a true aesthetics and epistemology of contrast. 18Humboldt generalizes his judgment even to the extent that he describes the insular space of Cuba, "les limites etroites d'une ile" (III, 325) as a negative factor in itself. "9The publishers of the new Spanish edition of the Essaipolitique sur l'Ile de Cuba interpret Humboldt's negative perception of Havana in the context of his medical interest in epidemics: Miguel-Angel Puig-Samper/Consuelo Naranjo Orovio/Armando Garcia Gonzalez, "Alejandro de Humboldt y la Isla de Cuba" ('Estudio introductorio'), in: Alexander von Humboldt, Ensayo politico sobre la Isla de Cuba (Madrid/Valladolid, 1998), 17-98, esp. 72. Historically Humboldt's description of Havana can indeed be read within the discourse on hygiene that is examined by Alain Corbin: as an increased sensitivity to smell that is accompanied by a policy of "deodorizing"; see Alain Corbin, Le Miasme et la Jonquille. L'odorat et l'imaginaire social aux XVIIIe - XIXe siecles (Paris, 1982). 20Alejo Carpentier, La ciudad de las columnas (La Habana, 1982 [orig. 1964]). 21"Humboldt se quejaba, en su tiempo, del mal trazado de las calles habaneras. Pero llega uno a preguntarse, hoy, si no se ocultaba una gran sabiduria en ese &lt;mal trazado&gt; que aun parece dictado por la necesidad primordial - tropical--, de jugar al escondite con el sol...," Carpentier, 11-12. 22"La mampara participaba del moblaje, de la decoraci6n interior, de la heraldica, y hasta de la etica de la mansi6n," Carpentier, 67. 23Fernando Ortiz mentions a couple of points that could potentially be critical ("defectos," LXXVIII) for a Cuban reception of Humboldt in his introduction to the Cuban edition of the Ensayo politico sobre la Isla de Cuba, yet always doing so in order to rescind them immediately, usually by relativizing or justifying them historically: Humboldt's-human- rights-oriented! -endorsement of an expansionism of the U.S.A. not only in Mexico, but also in Cuba (LXXXII), "el anexionismo de Humboldt " (LXXXIII)-"Esto parece una antinomia de Humboldt. ,Ser liberal y desear la anexi6n de unos territorios mas a los 76</page><page sequence="15">Oliver Lubrich Estados Unidos, y precisamente los de su querido Mejico?" (LXXXIII); Humboldt's alleged participation in a Prussian-French plot against Karl Marx in the year 1845, as mentioned by Friedrich Engels and by the Cuban-born (!) socialist and son-in-law of Karl Marx, Paul Lafargue (LXXII); his underestimation of the popular support for the Latin American liberation movement (LXXIV, XC) and his misjudgment of the potential "Libertadores," which Humboldt later reflects self-critically (LXXV); his political compromises with the elite of the Anciens Regimes (LXXVI)-"ayudar al progreso del liberalismo utilizando las mismas fuerzas absolutistas" (LXXVIII); Humboldt's alledged vanity (LXII); and his supposed neglect of the literary form (LXXVII). See a recent, more differentiated historico-political critique: Rodrigo Quesada Monge, "Humboldt, Bolivar y Marx: encuentros y desencuentros," Casa de las Americas 216 (July-September 1999): 5- 15. 24The reception of the Mexican essay was much more controversial esp. in Mexico than that of the Cuban essay in Cuba. Pertinent examples of a polemically critical and an affirmative Mexican reading of Humboldt are the works of Juan Ortega y Medina and Enrique Krauze: Ortega y Medina describes Humboldt as an imperialist agent in the service of the United States; he accuses him of being scientifically superficial and lacking literary talent; he blames him for fundamentally misunderstanding the Hispano-American reality and criticizes the instrumentalization of the image Humboldt had created of Mexico by the Creole elite. In contrast, Krauze reads Humboldt from the perspective of the theories of Octavio Paz as a guide to a self-critical coming-to-terms with the Mexican past, to a mental opening and modernization as well as a positive self-determination of a national cultural identity. Juan A. Ortega y Medina, "Estudio preliminar," in: Alexander von Humboldt, Ensayo politico sobre el Reino de la Nueva Espana, transl. Vicente Gonzalez Arnao (Mexico, 1966), IX- LIII; Enrique Krauze, "Humboldt y Mexico: un amor correspondido," Vuelta, 18/212 (July 1994): 21-24. See also: Jose Miranda, Humboldt y Mexico (Mexico, 1962). 25Carpentier, 13. 26Ortega y Medina, XLI; also F. Mateos, "Viaje de Humboldt a la America Espafiola," Razon y Fe 160-161 (1959): 301 (cited by Ortega y Medina). 27Fernando Ortiz even interprets Humboldt's literature from a progressivist antibaroque impulse: "Humboldt supo librarse del ambiente literario de su epoca, muy entregada aun a los estofados y encaracolamientos del gusto barroco," in: Ortiz, LXXVII. However, this lack of interest in things baroque is typical for Humboldt's time: During his Italian journey Goethe paid attention primarily to monuments of the antiquity and not to the churches built in the baroque period. Classicism strictly opposed the aesthetics of the baroque, attempting to overcome it as a form of new simplicity, grounding itself on the model provided by antiquity; the romantic period later rediscovered the Middle Ages. Only modernism revalued the baroque (Banjamin, Carpentier). I thank Hans Christoph Buch, Berlin, for these suggestions. 28In the descriptions of the South American heartland, especially the Llanos and the rain- forest, motivic and stylistic parallels between Humboldt and the authors of the so-called "real-maravilloso" or "realismo magico" movement, as for example Alejo Carpentier ("estilo barroco") or R6mulo Gallegos, can be observed: Alejo Carpentier, Los pasos perdidos (Buenos Aires, 1996 [orig. 1953]); R6mulo Gallegos, Canaima (Bogota, 1985 [orig. 1935]); see David Hernandez, "Alexander von Humboldt, die andere Suche nach El Dorado: Die 'Reise in die Aquinoktial-Gegenden des Neuen Kontinents' als Vorbote des 77</page><page sequence="16">German Studies Review 26/1 (2003) lateinamerikanischen Romans," in: Alexander von Humboldt-die andere Suche nach El Dorado und weitere Essays zur zeitgenossischen lateinamerikanischen Literatur (London, 1996), 6-42; Charles Minguet, "R6mulo Gallegos a la lumiere de Humboldt," Crisol 5 (October 1986): 47-49. 29For a Marxist Interpretation of the Essai politique see Christiane Bimberg, "El 'Ensayo politico sobre la Isla de Cuba' de Alejandro de Humboldt como ejemplo de literatura sobre viajes a principios de siglo XIX," in: Manuel Lorenzo, ed., Alejandro de Humboldt. Trabajos leidos el 2 de marzo de 1984 en la sesion cientifica en comemoracion del 125 Aniversario de la Muerte de Alejandro de Humboldt, celebrada en el Centro de Estudios de Historia y Organizacion de la Ciencia 'Carlos J. Finlay' de la Academia de Ciencias de Cuba (= Academia de Ciencias de Cuba. Conferencias y estudios de Historia y organizaci6n de la ciencia 39, [La Habana, 1984]), 23-42. On the increasing cultural importance of the African elements in the formation of a Cuban identity, see Robert Held, "Anregungen fur Fidel Castro. Alexander von Humboldt und Cubas afrikanische Berufung," Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, August 12, 1978. 30See Barbara Schuchard, "El analisis de la realidad econ6mica y politica de Cuba," Humboldt 41:126 (1999): 92-98. 31The new Cuban edition of the Ensayo politico includes a note of the U.S. editor Thrasher that corrects Humboldt's rendering of events in this particular case: Columbus' ashes were brought to Havana in 1796 and kept there in the cathedral; Cortes' ashes had already been transferred from the Iglesia de San Francisco into the Iglesia de Jesus Nazareno in 1794 (8- 9). Humboldt seems to have stretched these historical associations. Yet the references he makes to specific locations seem to be otherwise correct. The hypothesis of a loss of orientation on his part in the old center of Havana, that not only Alejo Carpentier gathered from Humboldt's descriptions, cannot be verified from this particular mistake. The historical research by the director of the Catadra Humboldt in Havana, Ivan Muioz, to whom I owe relevant documents, shows that Humboldt correctly located the Paseo Extramuros and the monument of Carlos III, which was moved to a different place later. Since there were several locations where slaves were sold in Havana at the time of Humboldt's first stay, and remnants of such "baraques" have not been identified in the proximity of the Jardin Botanico so far, Humboldt may have poetically forced the mentioned coincidence of the official politics of colonial memory with colonial inhumanity in order to fuse them spatially and allegorically in one particular spot: that of the slave trade. 32The competing levels of meaning in Humboldt's text can be described in the sense of Paul de Man's analyses of the "deconstructive" potential of "figurality" or "rhetoricity," especially in Allegories of Reading. Figural Language in Rousseau, Nietzsche, Rilke, and Proust (New Haven/London, 1979). 33The meaning of "revenue" can be traced back to the thirteenth century: see Emile Littre. Dictionnaire de la languefrancaise, 7 vol. (Paris, 1956-1958), entry "interet." Humboldt clearly does not use these terms exclusively in their contemporary meanings. 34Similar ambiguities can be found in about forty more such notions. 35Compare the concept of scientific-aesthetic observation of Nature as "Naturgemalde" that Humboldt laid out in his Ansichten der Natur, ed. Adolf Meyer-Abich (Stuttgart, 1992), 33ff., esp. "Vorrede zur ersten Ausgabe" (1808), 5-6, and "Vorrede zur zweiten und dritten Ausgabe" (1826, 1849), 7-10. 78</page><page sequence="17">Oliver Lubrich 36This meaning of the word is a rather contemporary innovation: Its first appearance can be verified with certainty exactly between Humboldt's return from America and the publication of the Essaipolitique- namely in the year 1812: see Le Robert. Dictionnaire de la langue franfaise, 9 vol. (Paris, 1985), entry "tableau." 37Humboldt had, for example, described the landscape of the Llanos in various metaphors: painting, architecture, theater, aristocracy, anthropomorphism, nautics, geometry, etc., all the while using consistent imagery. 38Humboldt's tendentially abolitionist essay on slavery was understood well enough by U.S.-American slave owners that the editor suppressed it in the English edition-over the author's vehement protest. Cf. The Island of Cuba, by Alexander von Humboldt, transl. from the Spanish, with notes and a preliminary essay by J. S. Thrasher (New York, 1856); cf. J. S. Thrasher, "Ensayo preliminar" (translated), in: Alexander von Humboldt, Ensayo politico (1998), 309-56; also Humboldt's reply to Thrasher in: Berlinische Nachrichten von Staats- und gelehrten Sachen 172 (July 25, 1856): 4.

La Modernidad y la Independencia americana (Madrid, 2000), 183-201. 39The optimistic note on slavery at the end of Alexander von Humboldt's Essai politique sur l'lle de Cuba is pragmatically motivated. The reasons are "concessions," but the last word is "humanit6": "La crainte du danger arrachera des concessions que reclament les principes etemels de la justice et de l'humanit6." (III, 483). 40Homi K. Bhabha, The Location of Culture (London, 1994), especially: "The Other Question. Stereotype, Discrimination and the Discourse of Colonialism," 66-84; "Sly Civility," 93-101; "Of Mimicry and Man. The ambivalence of colonial discourse," 85-92; and "Signs Taken for Wonders. Questons of Ambivalence and Authority under a Tree outside Delhi, May 1817," 102-122. Homi Bhabha develops a postcolonial theory of culture in general and of colonial discourses in particular from a poststructuralist perspective. Bhabha describes elements of colonial discourses in their "textuality," "rhetoricity," and "temporality" as "ecriture," "iterative enounciation," "unstable significance" etc., and states again and again the "ambiguity" of the colonial signifier, "the ambivalence of colonial cultural texts" (119): "[I]n the very practice of domination the language of the master becomes hybrid" (33). 410n the scientifically geographical dimension of the Essaipolitique, see Hanno Beck, "La obra sobre Cuba de Alejandro de Humboldt como fuente de conocimiento," in: Holl, 37- 50. 42Margot Faak points out that Humboldt's diplomatic remarks on Cuban society in the edited version of Relation historique ("einen scharferen Blick fur den Zustand der Kolonien und der Metropole in Havana" [I, 590-91], "in keinem Teil Spanisch-Amerikas hat die Zivilisation eine europaischere Physiognomie gewonnen." [III, 407-408]) differ positively from the observations in the more sponteously written travel diaries ("wenig interessant, als wir nun aus Mexico anreisten"): Margot Faak, Alexander von Humboldt auf Kuba (Berlin, 1996), 9-10. 43Both Humboldt's sojourns in Cuba received very little attention from the biographic literature, which dedicates at best some paragraphs to the essay on slavery, mostly in connection with general appreciations of Humboldt's humanism: Siegmund Ginther, "A. v.
