BY ZAGORKA LETICA The Neolithic Figurines From Vinca The prehistoric settlement of Vinca is situated on the south bank of the Danube River, fourteen kilo- meters (about eight and a half miles) east of Bel- grade, in Yugoslavia. A terrain of loess and the adjacent river offered favorable conditions for the establishment of a settlement in the Neolithic period. In the course of time denudation by the Danube has exposed a profile of successive settlements. Although only a small area of this site has been explored, sys- tematic excavation of this limited area (1908-34) has produced a wealth of material which ensures for the site of Vinca a special place in the prehistory of south- eastern Europe (M. M. Vasich, Prehistoric Vinca I-IV [Belgrade 1931-36]). Besides abundant pottery and other material, sev- eral thousand whole and fragmentary figurines were found, surpassing in number, quality and variety all finds of figurines in this part of Europe. The stratig- raphy of the Vinca settlement, in which life con- tinued without interruption throughout a long period, enables us to follow the stylistic development of figurines from the Early Neolithic period to the be- ginning of the Bronze Age. Although other cultures are represented in the earliest and latest levels at Vinca, the Vinca culture itself can be divided into 2.

The Early Phase (Vinca A-B) is repre- sented by the material found between the pit layers (11.4-9.2 m.) and the horizon at the depth 6.5-6.0 m. The Late Phase (Vinca C-D) includes the finds be- tween 6.5-6.0 m. and 2.2 m. The same development of the figurines can be seen, although less completely represented, in the wider area of Serbia and Voj- vodina, where the culture named after the Vinca site is also found. Nearly all the Vinca figurines are made of terra- cotta; only a small number are of stone (marble, alabaster, calcite and limestone) . These latter are mostly zoomorphic, only three being anthropomor- phic. The figurines are the product of many hands, not of a single workshop. Some of them are well modeled and finely manufactured, with polished sur- faces, while others are crude and irregular in form, often almost amorphous. The clay of the terracotta figures is well purified; almost all are well baked, especially in the later phases. The color falls within two ranges, gray to black, and reddish brown in vari- ous shades. Nearly all the finer figurines at all levels have a polished gray coating (Figure 3, left) ; others have a matt white coating, while still others are partly or completely covered with a fugitive red paint. These last two varieties, although they are more common in the upper levels, appear in the lowest as well. All the terracotta figurines are handmade, but there are dif- ferences in the technique. Some of them, for example, of cylindrical shape, are freely hand-modeled in one piece (Figures 1, 8, right), while others, mostly flat, are made of separate parts stuck together - left and right sides of the body, legs, arms, rarely head (Fig- ure 2, right). Figurines made in this manner were found mostly in the lowest levels, so that this tech- nique may be considered a heritage from the Early Neolithic Starčevo culture; some material of this sort was found in the lowest layers together with Vinca types. The third variant is relief technique - the fig- urines are made separately and then attached to a plaque or the surface of a vase (Figure 11, left) . The height of the figures ranges from 5 to 15 cm. with the exception of a few which are larger. The remains of only one monumental figure were found. The Vinca figurines may be divided into three kinds. Most of them are single free-standing figures, others form groups such as the kourotrophos (mother and child, Figure 11) and still others take the form 4.

Both human and animal forms are included among the free-standing figures. Domestic animals (ox, goat, sheep, dog) are most frequently represented (Figure 5), although other animals such as birds and frogs are also found. The animal figures appear somewhat later than the hu- man figures, although both types are found in the Early Phase. There are also figures representing fan- tastic beings with horns and beaks, and monsters composed of human and animal elements. The human figures are female, male or sexless. Fe- male figures are the most numerous, mainly distin- guished by the plastic modeling of the breasts. The rare male figures have the genitals indicated (Figure 8, left) or wear characteristic caps. The figurines which show no sex are considered to be female. Some figurines seem to represent hermaphrodites (Figure 7) . A general characteristic of the Vinca figures is the prominence of the buttocks. The lines of the groin and the navel are often indicated. There are also a few figures with deformities (hunchbacks, figures with two noses and figures with exaggerated paunches) . The human figures are shown both standing and sitting. The latter are rarer and appear later than the former, which are found throughout the whole cul- tural deposit. The standing figures either have hori- zontal arm-stumps or arms and legs represented in movement (this latter is characteristic of those found in the upper layers). The sitting figures are of two kinds : the first seated on the ground, with out- stretched or bent legs and with arms either short stumps or placed on the abdomen (Figure 10, left), the second seated on a throne or pedestal, with legs bent or outstretched (Figure 12, right). The upper and lower parts of the bodies are not in proper proportion. The whole body can be either cylindrical or flat, or the lower half can be cylindrical and the upper part flat (mixed type, Figure 9). In the earliest strata the figures are elongated and stea- topygous, with the head made in one with the body, or flat figures without accentuated buttocks. In both types the legs are not indicated and the arm-stumps are sometimes pierced with small holes. At a depth of eight meters we begin to find fig- urines with legs well indicated and sometimes even knees (Figure 2, right). At a depth of seven meters the figurines begin to have flat trunks, with the lower part of the body cylindrical and the legs unseparated. This mixed type (see Figure 9) becomes more and more common in succeeding layers, and in some ex- amples the body tapers toward the bottom. By this time the flat figures are beginning to disappear. The figurines found at a depth of six meters begin to show characteristics of the Late Phase of Vinca. Completely flat figures have now disappeared and only the mixed type is found. Among seated figures, those on a pedestal or throne appear for the first time, as do the kourotrophoi and the cylindrical figures with marked breasts and long arm-stumps. The bodies taper downward. Above a depth of five meters the mixed figurine type continues. Now begins a more marked indica- tion of hips, often with holes pierced through them. The body is more and more disproportionate, with a short cylindrical lower part and an elongated flat upper part. The arms are more often represented as bent at the elbow and placed on the abdomen. Fig- urines seated on pedestals are rare. The mixed non-steatopygous type continues above a depth of four meters, with an increasing tendency to two-dimensional treatment. Flat figurines without prominent buttocks again appear (Figure 12, center). The hips are still marked, sometimes with a horizontal hole (Figure 12, center and right), as in the level below. Kourotrophoi and figures seated on thrones begin to degenerate. On the Vinca figurines special attention is paid to the modeling of the head, which is usually stylized. There is a definite development both of head and of face which can be followed from the lowest layers to the surface. In the figurines of the earlier strata the back part of the head usually juts out, the face is triangular, the eyes are incised at an angle and the nose is modeled (Figure 2, right). Figurines found at a depth of 8-7 m. have the back part of the head elongated and pierced by a row of holes. The face is still triangular, but it begins to take on a mask-like appearance and the eyes are modeled (Figure 4). In those found between seven and six meters the upper part of the head is flattened and the back no longer juts out. Instead of the holes, hair appears, represented by incisions (Figure 8, right) ; the eyes are also incised. The crown of the head is often rounded, the face is polygonal in outline and mask-like, the eyes are some- times modeled and the mouth is marked by a hollow (Figure 9). In the next layer above (ca. 6-5 m.) the head is no longer projecting but slopes toward the nape. The face is still polygonal, with the cheeks ac- centuated. The eyes are either incised or modeled (Figure 10, right). On figurines found between five and four meters the crown of the head is lower than the forehead and in most cases has a row of holes. The cheeks are still accentuated and are pierced with a hole. The eyes are incised in the form of a semi- 29</page><page sequence="5">9.

Left : "The lady of Vinča," depicted seated on a pedestal; broken off in front. The face is bird-like; there are horizontally pierced holes in the ears, shoulders and right elbow, and others around the head. Incised lines mark the eyes as well as clothing, and stripes of red paint are evident. Found at 4.38 m. Height 15 cm. Center: Flat rudi- mentary figurine with arm stumps, rounded hips and short, undifferentiated legs. Holes are pierced through both sides of head, arms and hips.

Right: A late figurine, from the level 2.8-2.7 m., which shares some features with earlier figures; she is seated on a throne or pedestal. Incised lines indicate eyes and clothing, and holes are pierced through ears and hips. Height 12.4 cm. Vinca continued circle or an ellipse, sometimes with eyelashes indi- cated. It is now that the so-called "bird face" figu- rines appear for the first time (Figure 11, left) : these are common in the next layer (4-3 m.). In this layer, head shapes which were typical in earlier levels appear only in derivative form. Stylization becomes increas- ingly marked, with the "bird face" predominating. The crown usually slopes backward and has a hori- zontal row of holes. The face is pentagonal, the nose is modeled, the eyes incised holes, though sometimes not marked. Above the 3 m. level terracotta figurines are still found, but only in a narrower sense can their stylistic characteristics be connected with the plastic art of Vinca. The figurines in the lowest layers are usually naked. Incised belts with modeled buttons - which may repre- sent aprons - are the first signs of clothing on the body (Figure 3, right). Some of these occur even in the earliest period. Some figurines of the Early Phase have incised lines around the neck forming a triangle and probably representing a necklace or the neck line of a garment. This, however, appears more often in the Late Phase. At a depth of six meters, in addition to belts which represent aprons fastened with buttons, there are other belts depicted by incised lines around the waist, from which hang fringes or bands. Probably these also constitute a kind of apron (Figure 8, center). Clothing on the upper part of the body is indicated by various incised lines ; probably some sort of waist- coat is thus represented (Figure 12, left and right). In figurines found at a depth of five meters oblique incised lines often occur on the legs, probably meant to be wrapped leggings, while on some examples "gloves" seem to be indicated. The figurines from Vinca have a strictly frontal pose. In the Early Phase they show no tendency 31</page><page sequence="7">Vinca continued toward freedom of movement; this, however, becomes common in the Late Phase, when arms are no longer mere stumps but are often represented with elbows bent and hands placed on the abdomen or hips (Fig- ure 10, left). Figurines with raised arms also occur, although they are rare. Some standing figurines have the legs separated. The axis of the figurines is now not always absolutely vertical, and some examples have bent backs. On the basis of these stylistic characteristics the Vinca figurines can be divided into two groups, cor- responding to the Early and Late Phases of the cul- ture. In the Early Phase (which is connected with the Early Neolithic Starčevo culture) the figurines are treated organically. One can see that the craftsman sought to give a realistic impression but did not suc- ceed because of his lack of technical skill. The cul- mination of the so-called "realistic" style came at the end of the Early Phase (at a depth of about 6.5 m.). An ornamental-abstract style predominates at first in the Late Phase (from 6.50 to 3.90 m.). The fig- urines begin to lose their organic form. They are more abstract and the representations of clothing are purely ornamental in character. By the end of this phase, above a depth of 3.9 m., the artistic quality of the Vinca figurines has quite degenerated ; neither realistic nor ornamental ele- ments appear. The figurines begin to lose their plas- ticity and tend to become quite flat; the artisan is content only to indicate the outlines. Much has been written about the significance of human figurines from prehistoric sites. Most com- monly interpreted as representations of the Mother Goddess, they have always been associated with the cult of fertility and considered as of special impor- tance for the understanding of prehistoric religion. In order to treat this problem adequately, it would be necessary to know in detail the circumstances of the discovery of these figurines. Although the context in which the Vinca figurines were found is not very in- formative, it is significant that they were found mostly within the settlement, chiefly outside the house foundations, only rarely inside. On the basis of such data from Vinca itself and other sites of the culture as well as on the basis of the stylistic development and the typological and chronological analysis of the figurines, it should be possible to understand their use and significance. The great number and variety of figurines not only from sites of the Vinca culture but from other pre- 32 historic cultures as well indicate that they must have had definite significance, but it does not follow that the significance is always the same. Since they occur within quite different cultures over a wide territory and within a wide time span, the problem of their use cannot be dealt with in general but only in terms of specific cultural context. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that the significance of the figurines may well have changed during the course of time, with the evolution of social and religious consciousness. There is little likelihood that the Vinca figurines represent a specific fertility goddess or that they were related directly to some particular anthropomorphic deity. They are rather a kind of symbol through which the primitive mentality suggests, by a series of associations, the relation between the fertility of the earth and woman's role as a general provider. Since a great number of Neolithic figurines lack specific at- tributes and are reduced to a general type, they could easily be accommodated to the needs of the moment, perhaps for rites connected with the fertility of the earth or for increasing the number of the members of the community or in various magic procedures relat- ing to problems of everyday life. On the basis of stylistic analysis the Vinca figurines are seen to be a local product, having an independent development within the culture but influenced by the figurines of the Starčevo culture from which the Vinca culture derived. Economic conditions, of course, also influenced their development. In addition, cul- tural stimuli and, possibly, migrations from Anatolia must also be considered, although this influence can be more easily traced in the pottery. In general the culture of Vinca seems to be connected with the Chalcolithic cultures of Anatolia rather than with cultures of the Aegean area. Since the Vinca figur- ines are probably older than the Bronze Age figurines of the Aegean area, one cannot speak about the in- fluence of Cycladic idols on the Neolithic figurines of the North Balkan area. This has also been confirmed by radiocarbon tests lately carried out on material from Vinca itself and from other sites of the Vinca cultural group. On the basis of these measurements a date of 4240 B.c. ± 60 has been assigned to Vinca A and 3895 B.c. ± 160 to Vinca D. Thus the beginning of the Vinca culture, including the earliest figurines, should be placed at the end of the fifth millennium B.c. THE AUTHOR received her education at the University of Belgrade.
