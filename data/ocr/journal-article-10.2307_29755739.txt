This mercantile activity, moreover, is conditioned by the complexity and vitality of the underlying social structure. It is quite clear, in fact, that the nature of the products required is closely linked up with the type of society of which the market is an expression: the ruling classes, insofar as they di? rectly control production, dispose of surpluses and thus represent the sole operators in inter? national trade. Within the economic set-up the -greater the surplus in agricultural and craft products and in materials extracted from the soil, the greater will be the demand for goods of ruling classes and individuals. The earliest urban centres developed during the 4th millennium B.C. along the lower reaches of the Tigris and the Euphrates, and favourable environmental conditions ensured constant production of large food surpluses and hence a growing rate of population in? crease. This productive system became concentrated in the hands of a small class asso? ciated with the temples of tutelary divinities or with the palace of the sovereign both of which were hypostatic .'embodiments of the same political structure. Owing to the pressure of growing internal demand, the main outcome of population increase and the rapid enrichment of the ruling class, there was a boost in the consump? tion of raw materials ? wholly lacking in the alluvial plains of Mesopotamia ? and of luxury goods. Metals, timber and stones were the main imports, their price being very high on Mesopotamian markets, correspondingly low in their lands of origin. It was cer? tainly this striking discrepancy between purchase and sale price that led to high profits and stimulated the setting up of an organized commercial network making up for the many risks that inevitably beset transport of goods in the 3rd millennium. Whereas the economic outcome of this trade affected a small group of individuals belong? ing to the ruling class, the cultural consequences of this phenomenon were indeed incal {*) We are much indebted to Mr Osman Sedqi, Minister of Culture at the time, to Mrs Fran cesca Tucci Bonardi and Mr Nicola Labianca, members of the Italian Archaeological Mission in Afghanistan, who are responsible for the photo graphs and drawings illustrating this paper, and also to the Mission's Field-Director, Prof. Mauri? zio Taddei, for his kind cooperation.

The continual dialogue 'and trade taking place between far-flung lands brought about a chain reaction that boosted and facilitated the spread of Mesopotamian types over a vast area which, in 2000 B.C., stretched from Crete to India and from Egypt to the Amu Darya. It is no surprise, therefore, that scholars should seek to identify the lands of origin of goods imported by Sumer which are sometimes, albeit obscurely, mentioned in the few cuneiform texts that have come down to us. In this way the mechanics of cultural diffusion and the concomitant rise of cultural centres, representing the first chapter in the history of Eurasia, can be reconstructed. Cultural stimulus and trade followed the same routes in both directions. Lapis-lazuli, the bright blue natural silicate delicately veined with gold owing to the presence of pyrites, was cherished alike by the religious piety and aesthetic sense of the Sumerians and neighbouring peoples. Often referred to in texts, this stone practically fills the role of the protagonist in one of the most famous Sumerian myths, Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta translated and published by S.N. Kramer about twenty years ago C). And today lapis-lazuli still goes on playing a leading part in the research of numerous scholars, for the only area in which it was once found is made up of a small group of valleys and mountain ridges in Badakhshan, a province lying between the Hindu Kush and the Pamir and within the north-east border of Afghanistan. The archaeological exploration of this province is at a very early stage, and it was only in 1966 that a mission led by Mrs Georgina Herrmann briefly carried out a survey of the region of Kerano-Munjan where the centres for quarrying lapis-lazuli are to be found (2). During the last ten years intensive research has been successfully carried on in east? ern Iran and southern Turkmenia, demonstrating that these regions not only acted as a link between Badakhshan and Mesopotamia but also, as they achieved an advanced degree of urbanization too, developed into flourishing consumer markets for most products. From Altyn Tepe, Namazga Tepe and other minor centres of southern Turkmenia in the 3rd mil? lennium B.C. there was a steady flow of numerous finished products in lapis-lazuli (3). The most significant discoveries, however, have occurred at Shahr-i Sokhta in Seistan on the delta of the river Hilmand. A host of fragments of lapis-lazuli date back to Pe? riods II and III (2700-2200 B.C.): they are mainly wasters from the manufacturing pro? cess and together with a vast collection of tools associated with the working of necklace beads (fig. 6), afford evidence of intense activity of specialized crafts (4).

Towards the end of the 3rd millennium, the regions lying between Mesopotamia and Afghanistan were not an abandoned steppe: towns and villages nestled near to waterways and around oases. The whole of south-west Asia must have shared the same social and economic experience and consisted in one vast homogeneous and dynamic market ? a phenomenon that was to be repeated on several occasions in the course of its history. In view of this situation, the discovery of the Fullol hoard proved no surprise. The importance of the event however, was highlighted by the fact that the find was the first piece of significant archaeological evidence coming to light in Badakhshan, and thus at least confirmed the hypothesis that Mesopotamia was in contact with such a remote area (5). Fullol is no more than a modest collection of houses situated on the right bank of the Sohi Azora river along the road linking Baghlan, the capital of the district of that name, and the farming centre of Khost Ferenj. The Sohi Azora is a southern tributary running in a north-south direction, of the Amu Darya; it flows almost perpendicular to the course of the larger river and, practically speaking, defines the south-west border of Ba? dakhshan (fig. 1). On July 5, 1966, in a narrow gorge on the road to Khost Ferenj two kilometres south of Fullol, some peasants chanced upon a number of well-preserved gold and silver vessels and numerous fragments of others. In order to divide up the booty more con? veniently, these objects were smashed into pieces by an axe. The local authorities, however, thanks to the intervention of Mr M. Hashem iSaffi, at the time Governor of the Baghlan province, at once got wind of the discovery and told Mr A.A. Motamedi, Director of the Kabul Museum who, quickly grasping the importance of what had occurred, sent Dr Rauf Wardak to the scene of the event. Five gold cups and bowls and seven silver ones were rescued as well as fragments of at least five others: not one of these vessels is com? plete or can be wholly reassembled; for they have all suffered severe damage. The total weight was 940 grm. for the gold objects and 1922 grm. for the silver ones. During ques? tioning the people it was, however, possible to ascertain that all the finds were collected in a conical mound of earth and stone debris, 14 m. long by 8 m. wide, resting against a rock face overlooking the road to Khost Ferenj. Having repaired to the spot and iden? tified the hole made by the peasants, which is where the treasure presumably lay, Dr War? dak dug two intersecting trenches on the point of clandestine excavation. They measured (5) Since this short report was written the Fullol hoard has already been published in a short summary by Louis Dupree and others: L. Dupree, Ph. Gouin, N. Omer, ?

The Authors are mainly inclined to date the find to the 2nd millennium B.C., having considered primary to the point of chronology the connections with the "Royal Graves" of Marlik on the South Caspian Shore. 11</page><page sequence="4">12 by 8 m. in length and 1.5 m. in width respectively. No other vessels were brought to light, but at a depth of 1.50 m. we came across a layer of ashes and charcoal covering an inhumation burial that had been much tampered with. The skeleton, with its head point? ing towards the north, was in a crouching position. Excavation was interrupted a few cen? timetres below the tomb where we met with a layer of rock. No sherds were discovered in the whole dig, and on July 13 the objects were all transferred to the Kabul Museum where they have remained ever since. Despite the work on the spot we cannot confidently claim that all the treasure to be discovered there has been recovered, or that the spot indicated is precisely the one where the find occurred. That the peasants may have given wrong information in order to put the authorities off the scent is something that cannot, indeed, be ruled out. In view of the prospects of future research in this area, it is important to note that in this section of the river Sohi Azora a number of tepes (mounds) that are known to us ? Qafar-i QaPat, Khosh Tepe and others ? have not yet been explored. Notwithstanding the hilly nature of the ground, this region is fairly well-suited to human settlement and thanks to the Sohi Azora is open to the plain of the Amu Darya. As we said, apart from a few fragments of vessels wholly destroyed, twelve vessels from the Fullol hoard have survived ? five gold and seven silver ones, all now in a fairly bad state of preservation (figs. 2-5, 7-16). The complex does not appear to be a very homogeneous one: different manufacturing techniques have been used, while the decorative motifs, whether hammered or engraved, can probably be referred to more than a single cultural tradition. The gold vessels were probably in an excellent state of preservation at the time of discovery, before being damaged. Apart from the bowl with bulging sides and flat base (fig. 7) all the others are decorated with geometric or naturalistic motifs. Indeed, the dec? oration on a high-stemmed, straight-rimmed cylindrical cup with a base shaped like a truncated cone is purely geometrical (fig. 8). The body of the cup and its stem, which was probably conical, formed two separate elements fitted together by means of a button joint on which a layer of bituminous substance was spread. The stem has not survived, and in its present state the cup measures 8.7 cm. in height and has a diameter of 9.9 cm.; the thickness of the sides does not exceed 0.11 cm. and the total weight of the object is 171.03 grm. The whole of the outer surface of the body is decorated with a frieze consisting of six square metopes each one diagonally subdivided into four triangles, and in each trian? gle the pattern is completed by a stepped-tower motif. All the intermediate space is filled with small engraved lines, while the frieze-bands and the diagonal divisions were executed by hammering the surface on a wooden die. This type of frieze and the same goblet shape show close ties with pottery vessels produced in various regions of the Indo-Iranian borderland. Down to the end of the 4th millennium B.C., metope friezes with strictly geometrical subdivisions were used as dec 12</page><page sequence="5">&lt;'~~~% AMu^r^^^ JfIizabadX ^ __^Vw / balkh X / \ ma?ar-i sharif \ m^ u \j S ^ ^ /baghlan m W i y BAMlYAU. ~S / ^/ chakcharan KABUlV^--^ALAl4bAD S \^ # &gt; r ? ghazni \ / \ #farah a /' ^ I r-7"^ XuNOIGAK Z/7"^ / ^ f ( , / X /IQANDAHAR / f" v^y ( shWhr-i 3'?KjMTA ff V 'V j f damb sadaat / .1 AFGHANISTAN \ "' &lt;? _ ^ _i Fig. 1 - The location of Fullol with regard to the main archaeological sites in Afghanistan in the 3rd millennium B.C.

In fact, the stepped-tower motif was one of the most common in this culture and continued to be a major feature in the subsequent Namazga IV period. It is likewise ger? mane to recall here that Geoksjur pottery and the patterns we are concerned with spread as far south as the Quetta Valley. In fact, we meet identical motifs in the pottery of the Damb Sadaat II period as well as in the Buff Ware of the entire Hilmand Valley from Mundigak (Period III) to Shahr-i Sokhta (Period I). During the whole of the 3rd mil? lennium these regions appear to be culturally closely inter-connected, and it is therefore not surprising to find elements of their advanced proto-urban cultures also in the more isolated Badakhshan. Two other silver vessels of the hoard can be related to the Turkmenian tradition: a straight-rimmed conical pot engraved with two friezes subdivided by isosceles triangles framed by stretches, a series of triangles executed by short strokes (figs. 4a, 9), and a very frag? mentary truncated conical bowl decorated with three parallel series of square-sectioned crosses joined together by their horizontal arms on which rows of 3 or 4 chevrons are carved (fig. 4b). The sequence of outlined triangles is a decoration frequently painted on the pottery of Shahr-i Sokhta II or of Mundigak IV 1. It is in this period, roughly corresponding to Namazga IV in southern Turkmenia, that objects and remains of lapis-lazuli made their appearance in considerable quantities. The provisional chronology worked out by Soviet ar? chaeologists refers the beginning of this period to 2600-2300 B.C. corresponding to Pro todynastic III (E.D. Ill a-b) in Mesopotamia. This chronology has been questioned re? cently by the American scholar, C.C. Lamberg-Karlovsky, after discoveries he made at Tepe Yahya, 225 km. south of Kerman in south-eastern Iran. In a Period IVC room ten small tablets were found bearing signs of proto-Elamite character that can be dated around 3000 2900 B.C. The latter hypothesis has been further backed up by several radiocarbon meas? urements and other minor factors (7). In view of the close affinities between the pottery of Yahya in this period and that of Shahr-i Sokhta III and Mundigak IV 2 a critical revision not only of the chronological scheme for Turkmenia but probably for Mesopo? tamia as well is now required. If the new chronology put forward by Lamberg-Karlovsky is accepted as an untested hypothesis, the geometrically decorated pottery of Geoksjur ? Shahr-i Sokhta I ? Damb Sadaat II would then be referable to the middle of the 4th millennium and thus become contempary with the Uruk IV and Gawra IX periods when lapis-lazuli appeared in Mesopotamia for the first time in massive quantities (8).

(8) Herrmann, op. tit., pp. 29-31. 13</page><page sequence="17">view in this matter is that the old scheme brought out by the Soviet scholars and tested by a prolonged critical revision on the materials is, on the whole, still acceptable. Moreover, the importance of the Fullol hoard is centred on the other four pieces of the collection that, in the kind of decoration and skill of execution, may be directly com? pared with similar products of Mesopotamia and Elam. They comprise a complex of excep? tional value and the earliest evidence of trade that hitherto has been attested only by Me sopotamian finds ? the countless fragments of lapis-lazuli that have come to light there. Our hope, then, is that the discovery of the Fullol hoard will kindle the interest of spe? cialists in a type of research in no way exhausted by these few lines of presentation. The best preserved item, especially in view of the particular strength of the silver alloy used, is a flat cylindrical bowl with a convex base, on the outer surface of which a couple of sturdy bulls are portrayed in repousse work. In each pair, one of the animals is bending its head down over a small mound (perhaps a heap of fodder), while the head of the other is raised and it is lowing with mouth open (figs. 5a, 11). The figures of these bulls are real masterpieces, stylistically without compare among the works of the cultural provinces of the Indo-Iranian borderland: they are of a breed that has nothing in common with the zebus (bos indicus) which abound in decorative representations of those regions throughout the 3rd millennium B.C. The massed muscles of the Fullol bulls are portrayed with extreme care; volumes stand out clearly outlined: and those portions of the body where hair is thicker are outlined with strips of curls. Head, shoulders, withers and part of the flank are thus covered with thinly incised bands. The eyes, the long hair at the end of the tail and the hooves are all accurately reproduced by means of incised lines simple and precise at the same time. The bottom of the bowl is diversified by a star-shaped motif with eight arms bent clockwise that introduces a markedly dynamic element into a yet simple decoration (figs. 5b, 12). We cannot, of course, in a few lines deal fully with all the countless comparisons that might be suggested. But purely as a working hypothesis we may postulate a centre in northern Mesopotamia as an area of origin; for here patterns of this kind are familiar from the Larsa Period onwards (2000-1800 B.C.). Yet in the absence of any direct com? parison we are quite unable to prove the value of such an hypothesis. The most important problem, is that of chronology, and on this point one thing is quite clear: a similar treat? ment of the surfaces and volumes of a figure is little documented with regard to pre Sargonid Mesopotamia. At the same time we cannot get away from the embarrassing feeling caused by the resemblance of the Fullol bulls to the far better known ones of Minoan Crete: we are up against a remarkable convergence of features that can only be explained within a wider context. The phenomenon is perhaps the consequence of trade extending in all directions, its hotbed being the Mesopotamia of the early imperialistic states. By contrast, the treatment of the same subject is quite different in the second silver vessel the origin of which, we suspect, is Mesopotamian too. It is a hemispherical bowl with a strongly flattened body: the entire surface is decorated with two rows of three bulls, each converging on an object shaped like a large goblet from the top of which there emerge 14</page><page sequence="18">three long lanceolate leaves (fig. 10). Compared with the first bowl, we are at once struck by the more cursory manner of executing of the figures: the massed muscles of the shoul? ders are, for example, reproduced by means of two simple engraved chevrons, and like? wise the somatic features and the hair-cluster of the tail are reproduced by lines and marks in harmony with the rest of the figure. In this specimen, too, the bulls have been executed by hammering with wooden dies. The most interesting feature of the entire representation is its perspective: the bulls are seen to be packed tightly together so that the forelegs are hidden by the rear portion of the animal in front. The base of this frieze of bulls con? sists of an incised decoration of small round bosses. Once again the question of direct comparisons is quite unsolved, yet the substantial difference between the two bowls stands out clearly even though they form part of one and the same complex. The frieze of round bosses recurs in another item of this group: a conical gold beaker where this decoration extends beneath the rim and forms the upper border of a composition that is particularly interesting. Here, the subject consists of two boars placed on either side of a tree with very stylized branches and foliage which is rooted in a truncated conical rock represented by a triangle of scales. The lower border of the frieze also con? sists of identical triangular scales (figs. 2b, 14). All the ornamental features are the result of a hammering technique. For the portrayal of the boars an evidently geometrical style has been used which is useful to enhance those features of which the figures is composed with no diminution of overall vigour. The representation of the massed muscles of the haunches is noteworthy being executed by means of heart-shaped incisions. Regarding the origin of an object of this sort, we can just suggest that the boar is a subject commonly represented in the pottery figurines of prehistoric Seistan; a few score terracotta and crude clay figurines portraying boars standing or in a position of assault come from Shahr-i Sokhta II and III. So far, no beaker or other gold vessels has come to light at Shahr-i Sokhta, but a quite likely conjecture is that the Fullol specimen was manu? factured in a centre in the not distant Hilmand Valley towards the end of the 3rd mil? lennium. More intricate problems, on the other hand, are raised by a small gold bucket, one of the finest specimens and, alas, one of those the plunderers damaged most. It is a large conical beaker adorned with a series of snakes: these are arranged vertically, their flat, tri? angular heads looking towards the rim, while their waving bodies run parallel and their tails bend to the left on a level with the base (fig. 13). The bodies of the reptiles, measuring 0.8-1.1 cm. in width are executed in a lavish series of dots. The heads contain two ring-like eyes simmetrically arranged at the base of the cephalic triangle, while two dots at its apex represent the nasal cavities. The triangular head and squat body leave little room for doubt that these are vipers. The space between the snakes' heads has been diversified by the addition of two subjects quite alien to the frieze: a six-petalled flower and the grace? ful form of a bird ? perhaps a vulture ? with a row of dots strangely resembling but? tons decorating its breast. The complete vessel probably measured 18-20 cm. in height; but 15</page><page sequence="19">it has been broken into small pieces many of which are lost. The overall weight of the ten fragments surviving, equal to about a third of the total, is 231.15 grm. The comparisons that are possible once again belong to the Mesopotamian and Iranian areas. A truncated, conical ceramic beaker decorated with triangular serpents with long twisting bodies, has been found at Susa in layers of Period A. This object is identical in its form and decorative technique, and as a result of such comparison a fairly early chronology ? around the beginning of the 3rd millennium B.C. ? is implied for our specimen. Patterns of snakes, arranged in an identical way as in the Fullol beaker are also known from Siyalk, one of the key sites of trade across the Iranian plateau in the 3rd millennium B.C. Here, in Period III, sherds decorated with rows of vertical snakes are rather frequent (*). The last item, that we shall now describe, proclaims its Mesopotamian character more openly. It is a fragment of a gold bowl, hemispherical in shape, with a straight rim and concave base. A row of bulls moving in a leftward direction are incised on the outer surface. The heads are reproduced frontally, the elongated bodies are seen in profile, and the tails of the animals, being vertical, form a rightangle with the coccyx. A thick mane, ending in large curls, covers back and shoulders (figs. 2a, 16). The head has almost been humanized with long slanting eyes, and ears covered with two lanceolate leaves that were probably part of ceremonial attire together with the long artificial beard (fig. 15). In this example, also, the massed muscles of the haunches are executed by means of heart shaped lines that we noted in the representation of the boar described earlier. Stylistically, this bowl has features in common with various items making up the hoard, while the bulls' heads reveal close affinities with the protodynastic bronze ones, though L. Dupree, in his recent note about this hoard suggests a direct comparison with the later grave furnishings of Marlik, the famous necropolis on the Southern Caspian Shore (10). The connections are instead striking to our view with the protodynastic iconography of Mesopotamia. There are numerous examples such as the bull's heads decorating sound? boxes of harps ? famous the one from Pit Grave 1237 of the Royal Cemetery of Ur ? or the anthropomorphic bulls so frequent in mythological scenes on contemporary seals. We then tentatively suggest for this piece a date between 2600-2400 B.C. Marlik is currently dated to the end of the 2nd millennium B.C., which is in sharp contrast with the dates put forward for other items of the hoard. On the other hand, the very circumstances in which the discovery occurred do not entitle us to rule out either of these hypotheses till an accurate analysis of all possible comparisons has been carried out. It is quite clear, however, that the entire complex comprises specimens of various origins and periods, and this often occurs in hoards containing objects of great value that tend to be treasured by a community over a long span of time. The hypothesis we (?) R. Ghirshman, Fouilles de Siyalk, pres de Kashan, 1933, 1934, 1937, Paris, 1938, I, pi. LXII, S/1963; pi. LXXVII, B/1,2,5-7, D/2-5; pi. LXXVIII, B/1. (10) Dupree, Gouin, Omer, op. cit., pp. 32-34. 16</page><page sequence="20">deem most plausible is that the entire hoard should be referred to the period 2600-1700 B.C., and that the early chronology put forward by Lamberg-Karlovsky and the late one by Dupree should be set aside for the moment. In terms of Mesopotamian chronology, the Fullol finds would occupy a position between the Protodynastic and Larsa periods. We only hope the significance of the Fullol hoard would come out of this brief report. It is certainly the first find in Afghanistan which testifies to the importance Ba dakhshan has as part of that dynamic network of economic and cultural ties existing in south-west Asia on the eve of civilization. 17</page></plain_text>
