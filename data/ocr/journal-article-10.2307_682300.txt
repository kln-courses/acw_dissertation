GOSSEN The University at Albany, SUNY From Olmecs to Zapatistas: A Once and Future History of Souls A SJOURNALISTS, SCHOLARS, AND POLITICIANS scramble to make sense of the dramatic jLYMayan insurgency movement that began on January 1, 1994, in Chiapas, Mexico, it becomes increasingly clear that this movement is much more than a peasant rebellion about agrarian issues or a violent critique of Mexico's political system. It is also a pan-Indian-more specifically, a pan-Mayan-cultural uprising. Among the issues that the Ejercito Zapatista de Liberacion Nacional (EZLN) raised at the initial round of peace negotiations in San Cristobal de las Casas in February 1994 were demands for Indian political and cultural autonomy in Mexico. At such a distance from these events I cannot pretend to sift, understand, evaluate, or even enumerate the specific items of content in these demands for cultural acknowledgment, but the main theme that prevails in all of them is something that any serious observer of the region already knows: everything in Chiapas is not Mexican. Indeed, half of the population of Chiapas is Mayan in language, custom, and ethnicity and willbe heard, as we have recently seen. The Maya Zapatistas are in fact demanding that the history and culture of Mexico's sizable Indian population be taught in all of Mexico's schools.' Mexico's negotiators have apparently yielded on this issue (EZLN has not, as of this writing, responded). While the prospect of this acknowledgment may be cause for celebration, it raises the question of just what constitutes the shared culture and identity of Mexico's many and diverse Indian communities. Beyond laundry lists of "culture traits" and centuries of shared oppression and marginalization in the shadow of Western colonial culture and the modern world system, was there ever, is there now, any essential "soul" of Mesoameri- can Indian culture? More specifically, how is such an Indian identity, Mayan or other, manifest in the current Zapatista movement? It is not difficult to understand why the Mayan rebels have chosen Emiliano Zapata as their paladin. Although he was of relatively modest, though not impoverished, rural mestizo origin, he did speak Nahuatl well. He championed agrarian reform in both symbolic and substantive ways, and today remains one of the few "undeconstructed" heroes of the Mexican Revolution. While the link with the symbol of Zapata himself does not seem difficult to under- stand, other aspects of the Zapatista rebellion's Indian identity are harder to compre- hend. For example, why have the Zapatistas chosen Subcomandante Marcos as their spokesperson and most visible leader? He is, after all, a fair-skinned criollo who, by his own testimony, bailed out of the gilded upper-middle-class culture of Mexico City. Furthermore, one of the early and most widely publicized martyrs of the first days of the Zapatista revolt wasJanine Pauline Archembault Biazot, a white ex-nun known as "La Coronela" (the Colonel). She was of French birth and Canadian residency and is said to have died heroically as she led the Indian troops in the siege of the town of Las Margaritas on January 1, 1994 (Mendivil 1994:10-14). The Zapatistas' collective Indian leadership itself-said to consist of a directorate of Tzeltals, Tzotzils, Tojolabals, and other elders, male and female, from various Maya-speaking communities-has thus far remained relatively silent and invisible insofar as any direct contact with the media is concerned.

Although Mexico and Guatemala now have dozens of individuals and institutional entities that are currently working toward the goal of pan-Indian solidarity in the areas of literacy, literature, the arts, and social policy, it is nevertheless worthy of note that the symbolic and ideological force behind the growing Indian politicization in Mesoamerica, as in the Zapatista rebellion itself, does not have an easily identifiable Indian "center." Elsewhere I have attempted to understand where authority, instrumentality, causality, and symbolic power lie in the Chamula Tzotzil historical landscape and cognitive universe (Gossen 1993b). I was concerned with a paradox: why should one of the most demographically significant, politically self-confident, and ethnically conservative In- dian communities in Mexico live in the very center of a cosmos populated by white- skinned deities and adversaries and black-skinned demons and life forces? Where is the "Indian" in their cosmological, spiritual, and historical landscape? After all, Chamulas are, by their own self-identification, "the true people." On examining Chamula oral historical accounts, sacred narratives, and ritual prac- tice, I found that virtually all beings, human and supernatural, who have influenced their lives and destiny in major ways in the past and present are not "ethnic Indians" at all. Their principal deities-the Sun/Christ, Moon/Virgin Mary, and the saints-ap- pear, both iconographically and poetically, as "white." Their major historical allies, such as Miguel Hidalgo (the traditional father of the Mexican Independence Movement from Spain) and Erasto Urbina (a pro-Indian local hero), are classified as Ladinos, bearers of Mexican national culture. Earth Lords, who are cast as both good (bringers of rain, agrarian fertility, and other forms of wealth, such as money) and bad (sources of bondage and slavery), are also ethnically Ladino. So is St. Jerome, the keeper and patron of people's animal soul companions. Major historical adversaries, such as Mexican and Guatemalan soldiers, are cast as white. Furthermore, Tzotzils unambiguously associate white soldiers with predatory and antisocial behavior through their word for the common Norway rat: caransa, after Mexican Revolutionary "hero" Venustiano Carranza. However, La Malinche herself, known by all Mexicans as the Indian mistress of Cortez, appears as a Ladina campfollower of Ladino soldiers in Chamula ritual drama. Known as Nana Maria Cocorina, she wears a Ladino wedding dress and is ritually addressed as xinulan antz, "stinking Ladino woman." Black-skinned characters also figure prominently in the creation of, and threats to, Chamula life, destiny, and identity. For example, the black demon Pukuh taught the first people to reproduce and to enjoy sex, just as he is said, even in our time, to make shady deals in which Indians exchange their loyalty and labor for wealth. Furthermore, these demons have been around for a long time: they and their monkey associates, also black, preceded human life itself in the time before the Moon and the Sun acted to create the First World. Thus, the non-Indian Other appears to be a necessary precondition for collective identity within the Chamula pattern of historical memory and being in the present. In the present essay, I want to pursue a closely related question: the extrasomatic location of individual identity, self, and destiny. These two sets of ideas about collective and individual identity are related in that both modes of thinking encourage actors to account for and act sensibly in relation to their local moral community and selves by moving beyond them. Focusing on the Mesoamerican concept of the self, I will first tell a tale that chronicles my own unexpected involvement in this form of Maya social classification. I will then demonstrate that a key feature of this concept of self, its link with individual co-essences or "souls," has a deep genealogy in the history of Mesoamerican thought. Finally, I will suggest that this concept has become an emergent force in the maintenance of Indian</page><page sequence="3">Gossen] A HISTORY OF SOULS 555 identity and cultural persistence in our time because it is at once invisible, highly malleable, and responsive to changing social contexts. How a Toyota Wagon is Like a Coyote In the spring of 1985, Robert Laughlin of the Smithsonian Institution arranged a U.S. tour for the newly formed puppet theater troupe of Sna Htz'ibahom, the Maya Writers' Cooperative of Chiapas, Mexico. My university was sponsoring one of the performances, and since one of the members of the troupe was a long-time friend and field assistant from San Juan Chamula, where I have done my principal fieldwork, our home in Albany was the logical place for the group to stay. My friend, Mariano Lopez Calixto, felt very much at home with us in Albany, just as he had for several years in Chiapas when we were living there. Worldly and self-confident, he assured us that neither the United States nor our home in upstate New York surprised him very much. He did, however, surprise me with some unsolicited ethnographic observations about me and my world. Over rum and soda one night, he casually provided a startling assessment of me based, oddly enough, on our car, a 1984 Toyota wagon. It was a strange, needle-nosed, long vehicle that looked rather like a space buggy from a 1950s-vintage science fiction movie. Furthermore, it was pure white. Amidst drinks and laughter, he asserted that our vehicle was a coyote and that our possession of it affirmed his long-standing belief that my animal soul companion was a coyote, an aspect of my persona that he and I had never discussed in Chiapas. Furthermore, he stated that he had often dreamed that my animal soul companion was a coyote and that it really came as no surprise to him that we had such a vehicle. The link between motor vehicles and animals, by the way, is coded linguistically and perhaps cognitively; the noun classifier for animals (kot) applies to cars, trucks, and buses as well, for all of them are nonhumans that move about on four feet. On examining the wagon the next morning, Mariano carefully pointed out first the feet (tires and wheel wells), then the nose (needle-nosed hood), mouth (bumper and small grill work), eyes (tapered front-door windows), ears (two rear-view mirrors), and even the anus (muffler). This odd discussion was both funny and serious-also, by the way, strangely flattering to me-for all Tzotzils, indeed the vast majority of over 15 million Indians in Mexico and Central America today, have a private spiritual world of the self that is expressed through the concept of animal souls or other extrasomatic causal forces that influence their destiny. That my friend Mariano chose to speak of the subject with me revealed a measure of trust and intimacy, for the nature and identity of one's soul is not a subject for casual conversation in Indian communities; even less is it an appropriate subject for discussion with strangers. Mariano's assessment of me via the concept of my purported animal soul companion was also interesting in another regard. In terms of the world of Tzotzil animal souls, ranked from jaguars for the rich and powerful to rabbits for the poor and humble, the coyote is vaguely in the middle. This is probably close to where I am in the social and economic hierarchy of my nation and community. It could also be argued that my coyote-mobile had quite a bit to do with my daily rounds that were related to my given obligations, personal, social, and professional-my daily destiny. The concept of animal souls and other co-essences goes well beyond being a mere evaluative vocabulary. These ideas matter. They constitute a key node in Indian cos- mologies and beliefs about health and general well-being. The individual soul is often revealed to one in dreams and interpreted by diviners, shamans, and other traditional health-care practitioners. Furthermore, Mesoamerican souls are fragile essences that link individuals to the forces of the Earth, society, the cosmos, and the divine. They provide this link because they originate or reside outside the bodies of their human counterparts, often in the bodies of animals. These alter ego co-essences can become lost, afflicted, manipulated by witches, or frightened by sexual excitement or some unexpected event. If these forces are fatally injured, their human counterparts die. In</page><page sequence="4">556 [96, 1994 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST other words, animal souls and their related individual co-essences figure prominently in native theories of evil, well-being, fate, and destiny. As such, they are also centrally present in the language, beliefs, practices, and symbols used in traditional health maintenance and curing. I believe that this set of beliefs and the language for talking about them reside at the very core of what might be called a native metaphysics of personhood in Mesoamerica. However, the challenge of interpreting and understanding this belief system (if it is a "system") is nevertheless formidable. I began, therefore, with the Toyota-as-coyote-as- Gary Gossen anecdote, for it was really only on that occasion that I first experienced a spontaneous exchange on the theme-that is, a conversation that directly involved me as the subject rather than as the observer or interviewer. Through this experience, I was forced to realize that the concept of animal souls, which I have previously attempted to analyze as a coherent theory of selfhood, bears more resemblance to a fluid metalan- guage of discourse and practice for dealing with self, other, and human destiny than it does to any rigid system of belief (Gossen 1975). Indeed, I have found that several recent studies that comment on my own work in relation to this concept offer compelling evidence to the effect that the belief system is neither as consistent (from one native testimony to the next in the same community and from one Maya community to the next) nor as stable over time as I had once believed to be the case (see Linn 1989 and Watanabe 1989). All of this said, there is equally compelling evidence that the language of souls has fundamentally to do with Mesoamerican construction of self and social identity, destiny and power, as much now as has apparently been the case for two thousand years in Mexico and Central America. Tonalismo and Nagualismo in Time and Space Among the many wonders and enigmas that the Europeans found in America, one of those that must have confounded them most was the unseen and, for them, unseeable world of the Amerindian human spirit. Although some form of individual and group affiliation with spirits of animals, plants, and other natural and supernatural beings has broad diffusion in virtually all corners of the Americas, these invisible forces have assumed regional characteristics that are highly distinctive. For example, the generic term totemism, now common in some cognate form in most Western languages, derives from the Algonquian (Chippewa) ototeman (brother-sister kin), a term that, in its original cultural context, referred to the lineal descent of members of a clan from its founding or sponsoring spirits, animal, plant, or other supernatural. The term has subsequently been used all over the New World, with varying degrees of accuracy, to describe similar kinds of collective ties between social groups and their associated charter spirits. The characteristic form of this type of human-Other spiritual affiliation in Mesoamerica designates not group relationships with spirits but rather predestined and relatively immutable individual relationships with particular supernatural forces. In central Mexico these forces or co-essences are called tonalli, while in the Maya area they are chanuletik (Tzotzil "animal souls"), or ch'uleletik (Tzotzil "souls"), or cognate terms deriving from the proto-Maya way ("sleep," "dream," or "witch [craft]") (Houston and Stuart 1989:5). These forces are typically identified with animals but may also, in the same community, take the form of other soul co-essences. Related to these concepts is the body of beliefs known as nagualismo, which generally refers to the transformation of humans into those animals or other spirits with which they have an individual relationship. The term nagualism is associated particularly with the explanation of how shamans, sorcerers, and witches accomplish their goals for good and ill. Their means is temporary transformation into the animal(s) or other spirit(s) with which they have special supernatural ties (Adams and Rubel 1967:336).</page><page sequence="5">557 Gossen] A HISTORY OF SOULS The thread that unifies these various expressions of the concept focuses on the forces that influence the destiny of the self. These forces lie outside of the body and are thus not easy to change or manipulate. One must live within the general parameters of one's destiny. This destiny is linked to fragile essences that can become lost, frightened, or injured. These afflictions of the soul may cause sickness or misfortune, whereupon one can engage other supernatural forces (often the souls of shamans and witches who are available for hire) to intervene to restore equilibrium to one's charted destiny. The preferred route to spiritual health is propitiation and adherence to normative behav- ior-that is to say, health maintenance rather than remedial intervention, for the latter is uncertain and often expensive. Reports and detailed descriptions of these beliefs are omnipresent in the modern ethnographic literature of Mesoamerica. Furthermore, the expression of these beliefs varies greatly from community to community.2 In a recent comprehensive ethnographic study of this concept in Cancuc, a contemporary Tzeltal (Maya) community, Pedro Pitarch (1993) shows not only that these co-essences are centrally important to the maintenance of political and religious authority but also that influential individuals may acquire more than one lab (co-essence), one or more of which may be inherited by other individuals. This conservative contemporary expression of the co-essence concept invites comparison with the central role that co-essences appear to have had in ancient Mesoamerican states. These concepts have also been extensively described in sources that date from the contact period, such as Sahagun's Florentine Codex (1969), and the colonial period, such as Ruiz de Alarcon (1982) and Gage (1958). Nonanthropologists and Protestant missionaries in our time have also reported these "superstitions" with particular zeal and condescension, as does Hugh Steven in his missionary novel, They Dared to be Different (1976). Writing about the current efforts to convert the Chamula Tzotzil Maya to Protestantism, he accounts for his hero's early experience with paganism in these words: Mariano's heartbreak would stop, but not his fear and hate. As a child he dreaded his father, stood in awe of the healing powers of the ilol, and felt sprays of ice-cold panic sweep up his back whenever someone talked about the brujo who could change himself into an animal with the power to kill. [1976:51] In the sections that follow, I will present evidence for the antiquity of the animal-soul concept in Mesoamerica and will then proceed to discuss its impressive power in our time as a source of internal social control and social therapywithin Indian communities, and also, by extension, its strength as a tool of passive (perhaps now becoming active?) resistance to spiritual and cultural conquest of the region by Western culture. Whatever may have been the public role of these beliefs in the calendrical and dynastic rituals of pre-Columbian state religions, beliefs and practices related to spiritual co-essences have survived and evolved into our time with a relatively low, often nonexistent, public profile. Today, they typically belong to the private sphere of spiritual life whose ritual expression seldom moves beyond the domestic unit and small outdoor shrines; they have no doubt been there for thousands of years. Because this intimate spiritual complex does not have a conspicuous, public cult expression, it has been difficult to eradicate or change by force. Missionaries and others who have had an interest in planned social change in the area over the centuries have apparently been unable to deal with what they could not see, for tonalismo and related beliefs and practices have been, and remain today, largely invisible to outsiders. Indeed, there is compelling evidence that these beliefs are evolving in the modern era to serve as powerful ethnic markers as Indian communities negotiate relatively esoteric definitions of self and group identity that are not fully apparent, comprehensible, or significant to dominant groups that might seek, by persuasion, conversion, or violence to "nationalize" or otherwise "neutralize" Indian identity.3</page><page sequence="6">558 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [96, 1994 ;:000:0::::00; 00TifiSED::0:: : :D: S X E ;SS:;&lt;:X: E L:S: X i 00::: X &lt; : i; Li f i S:Q$jEASADd : 2 A :iC?g&gt;: : : : Figure 1 Jade effigy axe (the "KunzAxe") in the Olmec style.

Animal Souls and Co-essences in Early Mesoamerican States The iconography of ancient Mesoamerica is replete with representations of human- animal relationships: transformations, masks, anthropomorphic animals, zoomorphic deities linked with human dynastic leaders, ritual paraphernalia that suggest links of ritual practitioners with specific animals, calendar glyphs as stylized animals, and so forth. Indeed, the motif most fundamentally associated with the rise of the Olmec style, emblematic of one of Mesoamerica's first great civilizations in the Preclassic period (2000 B.C. to A.D. 250), is a were-jaguar creature that has hundreds of variant forms, all of which appear to link human political and religious authority with the supernatural power of jaguars or other jungle cats. This iconography merges human and jaguar facial features into a single countenance, making unmistakable the message that human, natural, and sacred power somehow come together in this idea. Might this be an early expression of the co-essence concept? (See Figure 1.) During what is known as the Mesoamerican Classic period (A.D. 250 to A.D. 850), the iconographic power of human-animal associations with theocratic statecraft reached new heights with the rise of the great cult of the plumed serpent, associated with the god Quetzalcoatl in the Mexican Central Valley and with Kukulcan in the Maya area.</page><page sequence="7">Gossen] A HISTORY OF SOULS 559 The plumed serpent, linked with divinely chartered human political authority and legitimacy, developed into what is perhaps the key sacred symbol in the art and architecture of many of the theocratic states that dominated Mesoamerica until the Spanish Conquest. Indeed, whole ancient cities were dedicated to Quetzalcoatl, and the legendary ruler of eighth-century Tula, Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl, was remembered in written and oral traditions of ancient Mesoamerica as the human embodiment of the plumed serpent deity whose name he bore. His cult inspired the rise of subsequent polities, such as the massive post-Classic urban center of Chichen Itza. The staying power of this deity and the ideas he embodies are such that it can be credibly argued that shamanic power via co-essences, together with associated claims to political legitimacy, may have provided a key ideological underpinning for statecraft in ancient Mesoamerica. Indeed, the link of shamanic belief and practice to divine co-essences and political authority figures as one of the central arguments in a recent, major work on continuity and change in three thousand years of Maya civilization (Freidel et al. 1993). (See Figure 2.) Until very recently it was impossible to offer other than speculative interpretations as to the nature of the link between animals, co-essences, gods, humans, secular power, theory of self, and cosmically ordained destiny in the early Mesoamerican states. However, rapidly unfolding new discoveries in the decipherment of early Mesoamerican writing systems are providing testimonies written in native Mesoamericans' own hand Figure 2 Lord Quetzalcoatl.

Iconography, writing, and long count date are in the Epi-Olmec Style. Provenance is San Andres Tuxtla, Vera Cruz, Mexico. Date, as per inscription, is A.D. 162. The lower four glyphs in the column on the left side of the figure say: "The animal soul companion is powerful" (Justeson and Kaufman 1992, 1993:1703). that promise to illuminate the meaning of the iconography. With regard to the animal soul concept, a very early Mesoamerican text bearing on this subject was recently deciphered by John Justeson and Terrence Kaufman (1992, 1993). This brief glyphic text appears on the Tuxtla statuette, which is in the style known as the epi-Olmec style and dates from A.D. 162 (see Figure 3). Justeson and Kaufman say that the statuette itself is probably a representation of a shaman who is calling up an animal soul companion. The figure on the statuette may depict this, or the shaman's impersonation of this companion, since it shows a human being in the guise of an animal, wearing a duckbill mask and a cape of bird wings and claws. In the great florescence of Maya Classic culture (A.D. 250 to A.D. 850), the hiero- glyphic inscriptions routinely used a glyph that reads way (related to modern Maya words for "sleep" and "dream") to signify the link between humans and co-essences, both animal and other. Houston and Stuart conclude their report on this subject as follows: In our judgement, the way decipherment fundamentally changes our understanding of Classic Maya iconography and belief. It indicates that many of the supernatural figures, once described as "gods," "underworld denizens," or "deities," are instead co-essences of supernaturals or humans. More than ever, then, Classic Maya beliefs would seem to coincide with general patterns of Mesoamerican thought.... Our final point concerns the certainty with which Maya lords ideniified their coessences.... For the Classic Maya, such self-knowledge may well have been an important marker of elite status. [Houston and Stuart 1989:13] Thus it is now possible to state with a fair degree of certainty that individual co-essences and their link with human power and destiny are very ancient and very persistent Mesoamerican ideas that date at least from the time of Christ.</page><page sequence="9">Gossen] 561 A HISTORY OF SOULS Tonalismo in the Aztec Universe (ca. 1550) Some fifteen hundred years later these same ideas, no doubt somewhat transformed by new cultural and linguistic influences and by dozens of generations of theocratic states, were present in the Aztec empire. Bernardino de Sahagun's Nahuatl-speaking assistants recorded their soul beliefs in the middle of the 16th century as follows: It was said that in the thirteenth heaven [in the uppermost of the heavens] our destinies are determined. When the child is conceived, when he is placed in the womb, his destiny (tonallh) comes to him there; it is sent by the Lord of Duality. [Sahagiin 1969, Book VI, Chapter XXII] In a recent commentary on this text, Miguel Leon-Portilla writes: In several of the books where divine presences are depicted one finds also the hieroglyphs which denote the tonalli, the individual human destinies which, at given moments and places, are brought by the gods. These tonalli, destinies, will determine everything in each human life, from birth to death. The tonalli is essentially an individual's i-macehual, "that which is granted to one, that which one deserves." Thus, the tonalli bears, for all people on earth, the consubstantial origin and imprint of the divine source of life; it is this essence that determines what is going to happen in accordance with prearranged schemes. The unveiling of this predestined plan and propitiation of its divine source are vital to the human condition. [1993:8] Of this same belief system, Jorge Klor de Alva has recently commented on the fundamental difference between these premises about the Aztec self and the system which the Spanish missionaries sought to impose: There was no autonomous will at the core of the self since every human being was a microcosm reflecting the forces that made up the cosmos at large. Furthermore, there was no clear boundary between personal will and the supernatural and natural forces that governed the universe. Consequently, acts that were believed truly to harmonize the contrary influences of the gods (saints, spirits, "devils"), rather than right intentions per se, mapped out the terrain of the ethical individual. Therefore, behavior, performance and punctiliousness, rather than will, contemplation or motivation were the key concerns of the Nahua who strove to be moral. Although the fragmented self was (and still is) believed to be composed of numerous physical and supernatural elements, three major entities, the tonalli, the teyolia, and the ihiyotl-all shared with animals, plants, and inanimate objects-seem to have constituted its core (L6pez Austin 1980:I:221-262). [Klor de Alva 1993:150] There are many other native testimonies from the contact period that address the complex world of the Mesoamerican soul, although no source, to my knowledge, discusses the subject in such comprehensive detail as Sahagun. Another extremely rich primary source of data on this subject is the famous Quiche Maya epic history known as the Popol Vuh, which was apparently originally transcribed from a hieroglyphic text in the 16th century that subsequently disappeared (Tedlock 1985). This long account of the "dawn of life" and of the myriad events that lead to the then-modern era (early 16th century) contains literally hundreds of passages and motifs that can easily be interpreted within the matrix of the Maya variant of Mesoamerican tonalismo and nagualismo (see, for example, Rosenbaum 1983). Thus, without belaboring the obvious, it can be stated without exaggeration that Spanish Christians, indoctrinated with the central theological doctrine of free will and choice (as these were given to humanity when God created us "in his own image"), encountered in Mesoamerica a fundamentally different construction of the human condition.</page><page sequence="10">562 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [96, 1994 A Soul War from Thomas Gage's Travels in the New World (1648) Although this essay will not consider the particulars of the collision in the course of the Spanish Conquest of two fundamentally different visions of self and destiny, a conflict still not resolved to this day, it nevertheless serves my present purposes to provide one extraordinary example of this spiritual encounter from deep in the Spanish colonial era. My goal is to illustrate that the labors of a full century of Christian missionization (1550 to 1650) did not manage to alter this belief system, much less eradicate it. The missionaries did, however, succeed in eradicating virtually all signs of it from public civil and religious practice. In private and domestic life, however, it survived, adapted, and evolved throughout the colonial period and into our time. The source I will use to illustrate this is no ordinary text. By the reckoning of some of us, it is one of the more colorful documents of colonial Mesoamerica, notable in large part because its English author, Thomas Gage, was a turncoat Franciscan priest who, midway through life, became a Protestant because it was expedient "so to do" during the Puritan revolution in England, at which time he had to publish his travel journals in a new social and political climate. He thus brings both Roman Catholic and Protestant biases to his reporting. Although Thomas Gage is a marvelous subject unto himself, full of ambiguous personal, religious, and ethnic loyalties, he was also a valuable chronicler of Mesoameri- can Indian life in the colonial period for several reasons. First, he traveled widely to out-of-the-way places where colonial administration was in its grass-roots mode; that is, where there was considerable slippage between Crown policy and local pragmatics. Second, he spoke not only Spanish but also several Indian languages; yet he did not have Spanish ethnicity or the colonial agenda to uphold or defend. Third, his observa- tion of Indian religious and spiritual customs carried an unusual set of biases, reflecting both his newly Protestant and his former Roman Catholic European self. These several unusual aspects of Gage's background may have provided a more objective lens for observing Indian life than one might expect from his Spanish contemporaries within the colonial establishment. I reproduce the following testimony with little editorial comment, for Gage writes engagingly and obviously does not need my interpretive assistance. The passages below report an extraordinary episode from daily life among the Pokomchi Maya of Guate- mala, among whom he lived, traveled, and provided pastoral care in the middle of the 17th century. Gage became involved with the following events through his ministry to a dying Indian named Juan Gomez and through gossip that emerged during prepara- tions for his proper Christian burial. It turned out, to Gage's horror, that his death had not been "natural." There came unto me at least twenty of the chiefest of the town with the two mayors, jurats [magistrates or sworn jurors] and all the officers of justice, who desired me to forbear that day the burying ofJuan Gomez, for that they had resolved to call a crown officer to view his corpse and examine his death, lest they all should be troubled for him, and he be exhumed. I made as if I knew nothing, but enquired of them the reason. Then they related to me how there were witnesses in the town who saw a lion and a tiger fighting, and presently lost the sight of the beasts, and saw Juan Gomez and Sebastian Lopez much about the same time parting one from another, and that immediately Juan Gomez came home bruised to his bed, whence he never rose again, and that he declared upon his deathbed unto some of his friends that Sebastian Lopez had killed him. For this reason they had Lopez in Safe custody.... The crown officer was sent for and came that night and searched Gomez' body. I was present with him, and found it all bruised, scratched, and in many places bitten and sore wounded. Many evidences and suspicions were brought in against Lopez by the Indians of the town, especially by Gomez' friends, whereupon he was carried away to Guatemala, and there again was tried by the same witnesses, and not much denying the fact himself, was there hanged. And though Gomez' grave was opened in the church, he was not buried in it, but in another made ready for him in a ditch. [Gage 1958:275-277]</page><page sequence="11">Gossen] A HISTORY OF SOULS 563 It is evident that Thomas Gage witnessed the tragic aftermath of what, in the view of the Indian community, had been a supernatural battle between the animal soul companions of two powerful shamans. The lion and the tiger (an English reading of the puma or the jaguar) were the co-essences of Gomez and Lopez, and hence their battle in the woods involved both their bodies and those of their human counterparts. Gage's narrative leads us to believe that neither he nor the Crown officials fully understood what was going on, though all parties, whether Indian or Spanish and including Gage himself, ironically concurred in believing that Lopez was guilty as accused. Animal Souls in Chamula (ca. 1980) One could go to San Juan Chamula today, or to any of thousands of small communities in Mexico or Guatemala, and listen to narratives of events remarkably similar to those reported by Gage in 1648. It is obvious, from the tragic consequences that surrounded the public revelation of the Gomez-Lopez encounter, that these belief systems could survive only in the private spiritual universe of closed Indian communities. It is also obvious to any ethnographer who works in contemporary Mesoamerican Indian com- munities (and who knows Indian languages) that tonalismo and nagualismo remain vitally alive in the late 20th century.4 San Juan Chamula is watched over and protected today by the sun deity, who is known in Tzotzil as "Our Lord in Heaven" (htotik ta vinahel). I have chosen to refer to this deity as the Sun/Christ, for his current "being" merges the concept of Christ, introduced by the Dominicans in the 16th century, with the pre-Columbian sun deity. Central to the Sun/Christ's plan for managing and maintaining order in the universe was a scheme of delegation of powers to his mother (the Moon/Virgin Mary) and several saints and other supernaturals. He gave to St. Jerome (known in Tzotzil as totik bolom, "Our Lord Jaguar") the responsibility for individual human destiny. The syncretic link of St. Jerome with wild animals is probably traceable to the traditional European legends wherein he was said to have made friends with animals while doing penance in the desert. Following this story, popular iconography of St. Jerome* evolved the convention of representing the saint with a docile lion standing or lying at his feet. As St. Jerome has entered the Chamula Tzotzil pantheon, his senior aspect sits with the Sun/Christ on the third (highest) level of the sky. His junior aspect lives in a sacred mountain called Tzontevitz, which lies in Chamula territory. In both of his aspects, St. Jerome carries out his mandate for overseeing human destiny through the medium of three types of spirits or souls that are associated with each and every human being. The first of these spirits is called ?ora, meaning "time" or "predestined lifespan." (Perhaps it is analogous to the Nahuatl tonalli.) Irrevocable from conception onward, the ?ora for each person has the form of a multicolored candle that is placed by St. Jerome in the third level of the heavens at the time of conception. Different lengths and thicknesses represent different lifespans. The longer ones of course have potential for generating greater heat and burning longer than do the shorter candles; hence, the longer candles are associated with longer lifespans. As long as the individual's candle burns in the sky, the associated person and his animal soul companion live. When it goes out-either naturally, by burning up its fuel, or prematurely, through the inter- vention of a witch (h?ak'chamel, or "thrower of sickness")-the person and his soul companion die. Because of its crucial importance to the predestined lifespan of the individual, the ?ora candle is nearly always symbolically present in curing ceremonies. Related to ?ora is a second type of individual spirit represented in the living human body by the ch 'ulel, an invisible essence located at the tip of the tongue. It is the first spirit to become associated with the body as a fetus (symbolizing the lighting of the candle in the sky) and is the last to depart from the body several days after physical death (symbolizing the total extinction of the candle). It is this essence of the individual that</page><page sequence="12">Wild soul companion animals Domestic and other anomalous animals (5 toes, like humans) (Cloven hooves, claws, etc., unlike humans) Carnivores Herbivores and Omnivores Hervibores and Omnivores Stronger people, rich people, Weaker people, ordinary Witches have one of these plus and cargo-holders. people. a strong wild animal soul companion. jaguar rabbit cattle ocelot skunk sheep coyote raccoon pigs fox opossum chickens weasel squirrel turkeys wild birds insects Early creation.

Since the ch'ulel has 13 parts, any or all parts may become afflicted. This causes various degrees and kinds of human sickness, of a general class of afflictions called ch'ulelaL A final significant fact about the ch'ulel spirit is that it is also present, with all the same attributes, on the tip of the tongue of one's animal soul companion. This leads to the third type of individual spirit, the animal soul companion itself, called chanul, deriving from chon, which means "animal." The chanul is assigned to the individual at birth by St. Jerome and the Sun/Christ. This animal shares every stroke of fortune that its human counterpart experiences. It is also of the same sex as its human associate. The chanul has two aspects, a "junior" (itz'inal) and "senior" (bankilal), each of which has 13 parts. The junior aspect of the chanul lives in the sacred mountain named Tzontevitz, located in Chamula municipal territory, where it is tended by the junior aspect of St. Jerome. The senior aspect of the chanul lives on the third level of the sky, where it is tended by the senior aspect of St. Jerome. During the day, these soul animals roam about the woods and fields of their territories much as ordinary animals do. However, at night, St. Jerome, in both his junior and senior aspects, herds them into corrals, the junior one on the sacred mountain and the senior in the third level of the sky. Here they spend the night in relative safety from the perils of darkness, a time when most misfortunes, particularly those caused by witchcraft, occur. It is in order to guarantee this nighttime care that one must make occasional prayers of supplication to St. Jerome. By far the most common cause of illness in Chamula is believed to be the loss of or injury inflicted on one or several of the 26 parts of the chanul (13 for each aspect, junior and senior). Loss can occur during sexual intercourse, fright, excitement, anger, jealousy, or in the course of an accident. Thus human illnesses are typically caused by numerous afflictions of the chanul and-somewhat less frequently-the ch'ulel, associ- ated with the candle of destiny in the sky. This makes a total of 39 parts of the human Table 1 The logic of the concrete: Chamula animal souls, from Gossen (1975:453). This table offers a structural examination of the logic of the co-essence concept as represented in the data provided by several Chamula Tzotzils in 1969.</page><page sequence="13">Gossen] A HISTORY OF SOULS 565 spirit (26 for the double chanul and 13 for the ch'ulel) that can be afflicted singly plus a very large number of combinations of parts that can be jointly afflicted or lost. It is the shaman's role to ascertain, by pulsing the wrist and by observing symptoms, what parts of the soul are afflicted. He or she must then prescribe the necessary candles, herbs, flowers, and foods and say the proper prayers at a formal curing ceremony, whose purpose is to restore health and integrity to the soul configuration.5 All animal soul companions are wild animals with five digits. Furthermore, all are mammals.6 It is the sympathetic trait, the five digits of the hand or paw, that establishes the special tie between humankind and these animals. It is significant to note here that the Tzotzil word for "man" (vinik) is the same as the word for "twenty," indicating that the total of 20 digits is considered to be a striking aspect of human physiology and an important anatomical trait of soul companion animals as well.7 Chamula animal souls are often ranked according to three levels. The third level is the most senior and thus includes those animals associated with rich and powerful individuals, while the second level is associated with moderately successful people, and the first, with the humble and poor. The only animal that all people agree to be a third-level chanul is the jaguar. The most powerful shamans and political and religious leaders, therefore, are logically thought to have jaguar soul companions. In the second level are generally ranked the coyote, weasel, and ocelot. The first and most junior level includes the rabbit, opossum, and skunk. There is general agreement about the jaguar's first-rank position and about the low rank of opossum, skunk, and rabbit. However, the second level is not consistently reported from individual to individual (see Table 1). Reflection and speculation (and disagreement) about this hierarchy of humanity in relation to the world of animal souls appear frequently in Chamula narrative accounts about their world and its perils. An example of this type of testimony comes from Shun Mendez Tzotzek, a master storyteller. He gave me this account (here translated from the original Tzotzil) in 1969 as part of a much longer narrative about the origin of human life in the first of four cyclical creations: You see, the people were occupied in increasing their numbers. So it was when the first people emerged. Jaguars accompanied some of them; Coyotes accompanied some; Weasels accompanied others. But those whom the jaguars accompany, These are the richest. Those whom the coyotes accompany, These people are poorer. Those whom weasels accompany, These people are the poorest. Those whom foxes accompany, These are the poorest, Just as poor as those of the weasel. Furthermore, those human counterparts of both the fox and the weasel, They don't live very long. There was once a person whose baby chicks had been eaten by some animal. The owner of the chicks saw it happen. So he shot the culprit, a weasel, with a shotgun. After the weasel died, It was only three days until the owner of the chicks died. [He had shot his own animal soul] and so died in no time himself.... In this manner, whoever we are, we die just as our soul companions do. You see, long ago it was Our Father who thought about all this. Our Father long ago gave us dreams about our animal-soul companions. That is why it remains the same even today, That not all of us have jaguars as animal souls. [Gossen 1993a:428-429]</page><page sequence="14">[96, 1994 566 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST The final line of Mr. Mendez Tzotzek's narrative darkly and cryptically observes, in the veiled language of this belief system, that human inequality and hierarchy are facts of life. His text both affirms and disagrees with some of my generalizations, stated above. However, the fact that a discussion of animal souls follows immediately after the creation of viable human beings testifies to the saliency of souls in his reflections about human nature: our co-essential consciousness, our strength, our frailty, our vulnerability, our inequality, and even our unwitting capacity to destroy ourselves. Death and misfortune, however, may also be caused by the malice of others, who use the language and premises of animal soul beliefs in the practice of "giving sickness." Although a normal person is said to have only one animal soul, a witch has one or several normal animal soul companions plus an aberrant, anomalous creature that is outside the class of normal soul companions.8 In some cases Chamulas note the number and type of a creature's digits as the traits that make it "different" from normal companion animals, as in the case of hooved animals and insects. It also appears that the anomalous classificatory position of domestic animals (neither wild nor human) gives them impor- tant intermediary power as witches' soul companions. Witches require the power of strong animal soul companions from the "normal" class so as to be dominant over all other chanuletik, doing them ill if their clients so desire. They require anomalous animals for a different reason: anomalous animals give them a way to slip into places such as house compounds without being noticed. This enables them to do evil things surreptitiously, as when they take the form of a turkey or chicken, for potential victims would normally not expect a domestic animal or bird to hurt them. All people, including witches, are said to learn the identities of their animal soul companions through dreams. Typically, people have the same dream three times. Although an individual's animal soul companion figures prominently in this dream, its meaning is not always clear. Often several animals appear in dreams, thus opening up the interpretive framework for uncertainty and multiple possible "readings" of the vagaries of one's destiny. In these cases, a shaman must be consulted. While shamans and witches can usually ascertain the meaning of their own and their clients' animal soul dreams, ordinary people are often uncertain about the identities of their soul animals, even in adulthood. Even if they do know, they are reluctant to discuss the matter publicly. In summary, then, the factors that determine individual fate and fortune are always to be understood and reflected on as phenomena that are predestined but also, secon- darily, subject to the agency and will of others, both human and supernatural. These causal forces derive initially from the Sun/Christ, St. Jerome, the candle of one's lifespan, and the junior and senior aspects of the animal soul companion. The healthy body carries this constellation of influences in equilibrium; it is the passive bearer of forces over which it really has no control. But this constellation can also be attacked and disoriented by others, both human and supernatural. The body, thus afflicted, suffers from a disequilibrium situation in the whole; a part is missing, injured, or destroyed. About the only ways people can affect their own destinies through preventive measures are by paying homage to the deities who are responsible for the soul animals, so as to encourage them to continue their vigilance and compassion for humankind, and by being con- forming, sensible, and generous, so as not to attract the attention, anger, or jealousy of others. Once afflicted, the only traditional way to remedy one's condition is to hire a shaman to intervene on one's behalf by performing rituals whose primary goal is to restore equilibrium to the several individual spirits that influence the body's well-being. In practice, however, the shaman also addresses the matter of restoring harmony and equilibrium to one's social relations. This is not an altogether comforting or secure worldview. People often express anxiety over whether or not they are complying with their prescribed destinies. Uncertaintywith regard to this matter can easily affect key decisions in one's life and can limit a person's willingness to undertake such risky activities as building a new house or taking a new</page><page sequence="15">567 Gossen] A HISTORY OF SOULS job. Might one be stretching one's "self'? Might one's neighbors and friends be thinking this? Although this belief system produces occasional private stress, its tendency to encourage social conformity and modesty may help us understand why it continues to occupy an important niche in the life of Indian communities and why individuals, perhaps including the clandestine Zapatista leaders, are reluctant to seek high profiles for themselves. Proof of the modern viability of this vision of self and destiny and the associated curing practices is that they compete very successfully with Western medicine and other forms of planned social change, perhaps including the Zapatista movement. They constitute much more than a "system" of "folk medicine," since they give form to thought and reflection about the social reality that surrounds the individual. Remedial rituals that are associated with this belief complex are called "seeing" or "watching over" ceremonies. They do not seek to change the preordained path of the soul through the life cycle, but rather to defend it from, and guide it through, unforeseen attacks and perils. Curers seek neither to change nor to circumvent the inevitable, but rather to allow the niche that belongs to the patient to be fully realized, according to the will of Our Lord Sun/Christ and St. Jerome. Obviously, there is enormous latitude for interpretation here, a quality that renders this belief system both fluid and adaptable at the same time it purports to address constant and unchanging truths. What remains constant, even within this realm of opaqueness and subjectivity, is a deep skepticism about individual autonomy and the very idea of a "self-made" individual who is guided only by pragmatic self-interest. In short, these ideas seem to deny the very pillars of Western liberalism. Chamula beliefs in co-essences coexist and compete successfully with Western medi- cine and political practice precisely because they address matters of self and society that are beyond the individual body. In practice, this is a fluid language of social analysis and social integration. In contrast, Western medicine is pragmatic, individual, and "demo- cratic" in that a given antibiotic accomplishes the same ends for an Indian or a Mexican, a rich person or a poor person. While not rejecting Western medicine or Western social practices, the Chamula system of co-essences seeks in addition to encourage well-being by situating the individual in the cosmos and by guiding him or her through the reality of social hierarchy and inequality. Tzotzils today accept both systems, realizing full well that their own traditional system deals with issues and realities that are beyond the reach of Western medicine and conventional, individualistic political pragmatism. The Future of an Ancient Idea As I move this discussion to a conclusion, I want to emphasize that I am dealing with a conceptual universe that is not only very ancient and very widespread in contemporary Mesoamerica but also, apparently, highly adaptive in our fast-changing times. It is clear that these beliefs once occupied a central place in the public religious and political life of precontact Mesoamerican societies. It is also clear, for reasons that I have attempted to demonstrate, that the political realities of the colonial and modern periods have obliged the expression and practice of these beliefs to disappear from the public sector. They have survived in the private, domestic sector of people's lives, where they have remained for centuries-vital, important, but nevertheless discreetly veiled from public view. In her well-known autobiographical commentary, I, RigobertaMenchu, the 1992 Mayan Indian Nobel Peace Prize laureate testifies to the reality and the very considerable importance of these ideas in the social fabric of modern Guatemala's Indian community: We Indians have always hidden our identity and kept our secrets to ourselves. This is why we are discriminated against. We often find it hard to talk about ourselves because we know we must hide so much in order to preserve our Indian culture and prevent it being taken away from us. So I can only tell you very general things about the nahual. I can't tell you what my nahualis because that is one of our secrets. [Menchu 1984:18-20]</page><page sequence="16">568 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [96, 1994 In our time, there is evidence that the commitment of Indian communities to a self-definition of ethnicity and community maintenance, based in part on belief in co-essences, is reemerging in the public arena as Indians in Guatemala and Mexico move to assert their own place in the ethnic mosaic that characterizes both modern nations. No one has stated this "emergent" quality of Mesoamerican soul beliefs more eloquently than John Watanabe, to whom I turn in closing: Having a soul means behaving in sensible ways, not just mechanically cleaving to established ways. Soul indeed demands mastery of cultural convention, but this need precludes neither personal opportunism nor cultural innovation as long as one has the eloquence to persuade others of one's propriety. Although souls unequivocally situate individuals within a community, they constitute that community more as an inclusive, continually negotiated ground of social interaction than as an exclusive nexus of essential traits or institutions. I would suggest that greater appreciation of these "emergent" qualities of Maya souls might well clarify the tenacity of Maya ethnic identity in the face of rapid,.. . increasingly violent, social change. [Watanabe 1989:273] What, then, is the future of this idea? I know of few features of Mesoamerican life, ancient or modern, that demonstrate more tenacity than the unseen Mesoamerican essence. This tenacity has occurred not through obsessive maintenance of a precious gift from the past but through creative reinterpretation of a distinctively Mesoamerican vision of self, society, and ethnic identity. Perhaps, in the next century, as John Watanabe has suggested, the Mesoamerican Indian "soul" will evolve into something closer to the Afro-American use of "soul" as a generalizing metaphor for the spiritual essence of a historically oppressed people in a pluralistic society. When the dust settles in the wake of the Zapatista movement, I believe that its peculiar unfolding in early 1994-with a strikingly low profile for individual Indian leaders, sensitive reliance on collective judgments, and selective reliance on non-Indian allies-will make sense, Mesoamerican sense.

Parts of this article were presented at a conference entitled "American Identities 500 Years after the Columbian Encounter," held at the University of Virginia, October 8-10, 1992. I am grateful to this institution, to Professor A. James Arnold, and to the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities for the opportunity to begin assembling a number of the ideas that are brought together in this essay. This earlier version will appear in the symposium volume, Monsters, Tricksters, and Sacred Cows: Stories of American Identities, edited by A. James Arnold, to be published by the University Press of Virginia in 1995. I am particularly grateful, also, to my colleague John Justeson, who gave me permission to quote from his and Terrence Kaufman's unpublished 1992 paper. He also called my attention to the Houston and Stuart report (1989) listed in References Cited. I thank my colleague Robert Carmack for calling my attention to the extraordinary passage from Thomas Gage that is cited in the text. I also thank Duncan Earle, of Texas A&amp;M University, andJeff Tewlow, of the University of Texas, for sharing their ideas on the significance of the 1994 Zapatista rebellion, some of which contributed to my own thinking as recorded in the introduction to this article. 1. As of 1990, Indians number around 10 million, speaking over 50 different languages and constituting some 11 percent of Mexico's 90 million people. 2.

The following discussion derives, in part, from a fuller consideration of this subject that is published elsewhere (Gossen 1975). I have, however, for reasons noted above, rethought and revised significant parts of my earlier interpretation.</page><page sequence="17">Gossen] A HISTORY OF SOULS 569 5.

The literature cited elsewhere in this article reflects the enormous range of animate and inanimate co-essences that exist in ancient and contemporary Mesoamerica. 7. It is relevant to recall that ancient Mesoamerican mathematics and calendrical reckoning were of a base-20 type, suggesting that time itself was anthropomorphized. 8. In Pitarch 1993, a hyperbolic expression of this pattern in the Mesoamerican co-essence concept is described wherein powerful individuals, both good and evil, may possess numerous soul co-essences.
