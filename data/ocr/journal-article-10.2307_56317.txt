LHOTAK Palaeobiology Research Unit, University of East London, Romford Road, London E15 4LZ, U.K. SUMMARY This article shows how a large palaeontological database (the Plant Fossil Record version 2.2, available on the Internet) can be used to draw evolutionary and migratory pathways. 2946 published records of the family Aceraceae have been found as leaf, fruit and seed, wood or pollen fossils, and their geographical and stratigraphical distributions are presented here in different graphical forms. Manipulation and analysis of the data have produced palaeo-geographic maps of these distributions, curves of the number of records in five global regions over the last 100 million years, and cladograms of taxa and their geography. The results give objective evidence which shows that early members of the family became well established on upland slopes of the north Pacific rim during the Palaeogene. Some of these early species migrated eastwards across Greenland to Europe before the North Atlantic opened to the Arctic. Later and larger migrations started in the Oligocene, from Asia westwards to central Europe, bringing a diversification in species both there and in the regions of origin. 1. THE ACER DATABASE We have built a computerized database of the published fossil records assigned in the scientific literature to Aceraceae. Here we show our application of these to different analytical procedures such as occurrence and cladistics to help understand the global evolutionary patterns of the clade. We think that fossils attributed to the Acer family are particularly suitable for this treatment because there is an extensive literature of well-preserved material with clear mor- phological attributes. Many organs are well repre- sented in the fossil record and the literature has good descriptions of most discoveries to help interpret the evolution and migration of the plants across drifting continents. Its fossil record has attracted so much attention that it is one of the few angiosperm families whose fossil and modern genera are allocated to the ranks of section and group. Wolfe &amp; Tanai (1987) have created a number of sections for some of their older fossils and their cladogram of American data is tested here with additional information from Europe and Asia. The results of this accumulative review show patterns of evolution and migration within the family which we compare to those of previous theories. The PFR database has 1391 occurrence records of megafossils attributed in the literature to Aceraceae, and the age and location of these are listed in table 1. They represent most of the published records of the leaves, fruits and seeds which are accessable on the Internet (http://www.uel.ac.uk./palaeo/). There are a further 1555 published records of pollen which are attributed to the family. These palynological assig- nations to Aceraceae are far less reliable than those for Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (1996) 351, 589-603 Printed in Great Britain the leaves and seeds because the morphological features are indistinct and easily confused with those of other families. Also, pollen can be transported often many hundreds of kilometers away from the site of growth, a process which is relatively unusual for megafossils. One purpose of this paper is to show how the new database can be used to help resolve biological and geological questions. So we describe the process of finding names and analysing them in different ways. However, users of this kind of database must be very cautious about the quality of the data and the different cultural and taxonomic attitudes its compilers rep- resent. Here, every record in figure 1 has been checked accurately to represent the family in the literature, but to confirm the original specimens or illustrations of that literature is an impossible task. Not only are there 3 000 sources of data in this work alone, but they are from different paradigms, generations, cultures and methods, and some material is lost. On the other hand, the use of very large sets of data might show trends and patterns through the noise: it is a new way of looking at things and work like this is to discover what might be seen. This paper introduces such a new approach to analyse palaeontological data. 2. EARLIER WORK ON ACERACEAE Gelderen et al. (1994) have recently published a monograph entitled Maples of the World. The authors give substantial details of the horticultural features of the plants though they have written chapters on taxonomy and evolution and list more than 200 fossil ? 1996 The Royal Society 589</page><page sequence="2">590 M.

Palaeogeographic maps of the northern hemisphere at: (a) the Late Maastrichtian (66-65 Ma BP); (b) the Paleocene (65-56.5 Ma BP ); (c) the Eocene (56.5-35.4 Ma BP ); (d) the Oligocene (35.4-23.3 Ma BP ); (e) the Miocene (23.3-5.2 Ma BP ); and (/) the Pliocene (5.2-1.64 Ma BP ), drawn from Smith (1992). The maps plot megafossil data searched from PFR2.2 and listed in table 1. The darker hatching represent mountain chains. species of the modern genus (most are from America and were described a long time ago when the concepts of angiosperm evolution were very different from now). It is mentioned that the oldest known specimens of Acer are described from the Late Cretaceous of southern California. Wolfe &amp; Tanai (1987) believe the first true maple is from the Late Palaeocene of Alaska &amp; Kvacek (1994) concurs. Muller (1981) accepts an Oligocene first appearance of the more voluminous pollen record. Here we refer to older records of the family, going back into the Cretaceous, based on the opinions of the original authors. So this work is setting what are perhaps unreliable fossil records against the trends of a complete dataset and may pick out dubious identi- fications, though it is important to keep our minds open about the evolutionary scope of different taxo- nomic groups. Equally, our methods allow the con- stituency of established sections and their relationships to be tested and to re-examine the patterns of temporal appearance and geographic spread. This rests on our premise that logical, albeit fuzzy, patterns will emerge from natural systems. The first major systematic treatment of the family was by Pax (1885) who created a number of groups and sections, with one to several species in each. Many subsequent authors have followed this taxonomic practice and fossils have been assigned (e.g. Walther 1972) to the groups and sections which were established on modern plant species. Furthermore, sections for fossil species have been created (Wolfe &amp; Tanai 1987). Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (1996)</page><page sequence="3">Aceraceae evolution and global migration M. C. Boulter and others 591 Taxonomic opinions differ with regard to the definition of these sections and groups, although some with distinct morphology are stable. Here we are trying to test whether or not these sections are of any value in helping to monitor the evolution of Acer through the Tertiary. If we are to believe in a monophyletic origin of Acer then these sections may enable us to plot the geneological changes through space and time. We can expect clear distributions of the sections in restricted areas at certain times. Maybe we will have got some of the assignations to the correct section wrong, and maybe there is a lot of missing evidence within the limited fossil record, but broadly we can expect to see good migratory and evolutionary patterns emerging. The family's fossil history recorded in rocks from North America is reviewed in detail, with illustrations, by Wolfe &amp; Tanai (1987). Their cladogram is based on 35 characters from modern and fossil species; it gives the impression that sections have evolutionary, pheno- typic and geneological significance, with 12 newly conceived extinct sections at the lower nodes. Tanai (1983) revised the fossils from eastern Asia and presented useful stratigraphic range charts for most of the leaves. The central European record from Germany (Walther 1972) and Bohemia (Prochazka &amp; Buzek 1975) is particularly rich and well described; other records from Europe tend to have fewer specimens and are described in literature listed in the bibliography. 3. SEARCHING AND PRESENTING THE DATA Table 1 lists the age and locations of the megafossil records contained in the PFR2.2 database with the following names of fossils which we believe are associated with the clade: Aceripollenites, Aceripollis, Acerites, Acerspora, Acer, Aceroxylon, Aceriphyllum and Aceraceae. For each record the database has latitude and longitude coordinates, and the age range as the number of millions of years for each record, allowing palaeogeographic distributions to be plotted by the Atlas software (Smith 1993) which we have also adapted for the Internet. Figure 1 shows a set of palaeogeographic maps from 1.64-66 Ma BP with megafossil records plotted. More detail is shown in figure 2 where the time ranges are much shorter between 38-54 Ma. Pollen records are shown in the palaeogeographic maps of figure 3 from 1.64-112 Ma. The many vast areas on these maps where the Acer- clade data are absent do have terrestrial Cenozoic deposits, giving confidence to our plots of migration routes. However, the database does have other sources of distortion due to anthropomorphic factors and a second method of presenting the information from the data- base attempts to take this into account. This is by plotting the number of occurrences recorded for each one million year interval through time. Our absolute plots of occurrence records through the last 100 Ma are shown in figure 4. Records from five northern hemisphere regions most compatible with continental movements (western North America, eastern North America, Europe, western Asia, eastern Asia) are plotted separately. Before we can make interpretations from such absolute curves it is important to check that it is showing real biological changes and is not too distorted by investigative noise. This is manifest in different regions which have different qualities and quantities represented in the database, due to varying numbers of localities studied, sediments preserved, palaeontologists employed etc. Although it is possible to apply regional adjustment factors to recognize these influences, very little in- formation is available to fix these features so that it is not possible to monitor the variations or take them into account by presenting relative values. The curves in figure 4 are of the absolute data with no adjustment, so for some regions the height of the curve is exagerrated. Also, the horizontal scales are often distorted by different stratigraphic scales and inaccurate age deter- minations. To help clarify the information the curves have been smoothed by Fourier techniques which have the effect of blurring the original data. From the first occurrences of the Acer-clade in the Cretaceous until the end of the Palaeocene (or the Eocene away from the Pacific rim) there is no evidence of large numbers of individuals or species. Such quiescense is characteristic of other Arcto-Tertiary clades we have examined in this way and we explain it as a time of evolutionary consolidation. There is slight evidence here that the group was distributed over at least three of the regions recognized since Late Cretaceous times and has been widespread for most of its history. The 50 or so records in western North America and eastern Asia during the Eocene can be seen on the relevant palaeogeographic maps in figure 1. Both the maps (figure 2) and the occurrence curves show the migration across western Asia to Europe after about 35 Ma. Thereafter all regions except eastern North America show a good number of records and diversi- fication increased up to the time of deleterious Pliocene climatic cooling. The migration patterns shown here give objective confirmation of Kvacek's (1994) view that the family was firmly established in the upland vegetation of western North America and eastern Asia by the Middle Eocene. Also by this time some species had moved eastwards across the higher latitudes of America and across Greenland to Spitsbergen and Europe. Not until the Oligocene did the plants in Asia diversify to the west to become significant members of Neogene floras. The distribution points give evidence from both pollen and megafossils to show that many of the (especially early) records are from high latitudes as shown in Smith et al.'s 1994 maps. However, they do not represent particular sections or other groups of the clade, at least as they are currently defined. The megafossil record plots do not appear to have any value in separating out the geographic histories of the different sections. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (1996)</page><page sequence="4">592 M.

PATTERNS OF MIGRATION AND EVOLUTION FROM CLADISTIC ANALYSES Our records of Aceraceae occur in areas which are separated by geographical or ecological boundaries and here we analyse the relationships between these areas by comparing them with the taxa found there. The underlying tenet behind such cladistic bio- geography (Platnick &amp; Nelson 1978; Nelson &amp; Platnick 1981; Humphries &amp; Parenti 1986) is that major patterns of taxic relationships are reflected in vicariant biogeographic events, such as patterns due to major land-mass movement. Several such movements took place in the Cenozoic, not least the opening and closing of land bridges between eastern Asia and western North America, eastern North America and Europe, and eastern Asia and western Asia.

Boulter and others Aceraceae evolution and global migration Figure 3. Eight palaeogeographic maps starting from Albian time presenting pollen data. Fossil pollen is often deposited far from its living home and so these maps show a more noisy picture than those of megafossil distribution in figure 1. However, in both sets of Palaeogene data there are strong associations of the records with major mountain ranges.

The idea that disjunct distributions can be attributed to vicariance events encourages cladistic principles to be applied to biogeographic analysis. The data we used for the cladistic analysis are listed in table 1. They were analysed using Component (Page 1993), a programme that compares cladograms using parsimony principles. Taxic cladograms and distri- butions are compared and generate the most par- simonious cladograms for the biogeographical area. Where taxa occur in more than one area then the problems described above influence results by in- creasing the number of assumptions that have to be made when explaining the topology of the area cladogram. Extant Acer exhibit extensive widespread distributions (Wolfe &amp; Tanai 1987; van Geldern et al. 1994).

Biogeographic pat- terns of extant Acer sections might not provide sufficient resolution for a cladistic biogeographic investigation. We have based our analysis of the data of Acer sections on the cladogram of fossil and extant taxa given in Wolfe &amp; Tanai (1987). This cladogram was used to reconstruct the Acer cladograms for seven age ranges, shown below. The PFR database was queried for all Acer species present in the database at each age. The species were then assigned to their respective sections to produce a final database which included all the sections present with their geographical location at each age. From this, Acer records were selected that fitted within the age ranges used for the analysis (table 2). Table 2 illustrates how only those records that fell within or close to the stratigraphic boundaries were included. Records from the PFR with low stratigraphic resolution were excluded. It can be seen that there are overlaps between the boundaries with respect to the selected age ranges, but these have been minimized. Cladograms for each age were re-drawn from the original (Wolfe &amp; Tanai 1987) to include or exclude Acer sections according to their occurrence in the final database. It was then possible to analyse the data using Spicata Palmata Distyla Parviflora Rousea Torada Stewartia Trilobata Macrantha Glabra Arguta Rubra Eriocarpa Cissifolia Negundo Indivisa Macrophvlla L Lithocarpa Veluntia Acer Monspessulana Mandshurica Pentaphylla _ Saccharina Grisea Princetona Spizta Campestria Platanoidea Pubescentia Decandra Manchesteria Glabroidea Columnbiana Orba Republica Douglasa Alaskana Figure 5.

Cladogram reconstructed from figure 4 by Component adding occurrence data from Europe and Asia for records dated as being older than 35 Ma. age. The ages to which each area cladogram corre- sponds are detailed in table 3. From figure 7 it can be seen that 13 area cladograms were generated in total, and table 3 shows which ages they correspond to. The first two ages, extant taxa and 10-5 Ma BP each have a single most parsimonious area cladogram. The next two ages share the same nine area cladograms, whereas the final four ages share three. There is little agreement between the area cladograms of different ages, and within at least two of the ages there is a wide choice of possible arrangements. Component also compares the total possible area combi- nations (for a five branched cladogram this is 105), calculating the mean number of additions and losses and the standard deviation (s.d.) from that mean. From this the actual additions and losses can be compared with the mean less one s.d. to judge whether or not the results are significant. This can be seen in table 3 with the significant actual additions and losses being shown in italics. At 35-30 and 35 Ma BP plus, the number of losses of taxa needed to justify the area cladogram are greater that one would expect to get by chance. Because of the wide range of area cladograms it is not possible to speculate about general biogeographic patterns shown by Acer sections, except that West and Eastern America tend to be more closely associated to one another in all but the area cladogram of extant taxa, where Western America is more closely associated with the Far East. This means that the data show that any vicariance patterns have been obscured by dispersal since the beginning of the clade's fossil record. We cannot infer too much from these results, especially when one considers both the nature of the data and the absence of a cladistic data matrix that would have allowed us to reanalyse the taxic cladogram at each time-slice. There are several features of Acer biogeography and evolution that may account for the discrepancies between the area cladograms. Wolfe &amp; Tanai (1987) postulated a complex history of dispersal and vicariant events that have contributed to the origin of the genus. They identify a diversification of the group in North America during the Eocene reaching a high level of sectional diversity in the late Middle to Late Eocene. In western North America the Middle Miocene saw the greatest diversity of Acer sections, followed by a subsequent decline. Wolfe &amp; Tanai (1987) associate the extant Asian sections with the western North American taxa of the Eocene, implying dispersal from North America to Asia. This scenario fits only one area cladogram, figure 7 a, in which western North America and the Far East are closely associated, probably by the Beringia land bridge. However, it must be noted that the cladogram that gave rise to the area cladogram 7 (a) is composed of extant taxa only. Wolfe &amp; Tanai (1987) thought that these Asian taxa re-entered North America by the Early Oligocene, but became extinct there by the Miocene. There have been several hypotheses concerning the origin and biogeography of Acer (Deschenes 1970), but Wolfe (1981) examined the vicariance of the group in detail without using cladistic principles. He identified several patterns; an eastern Asia eastern North America pattern, another is a vicariant pattern in the section Palmata between eastern Asia and western North America. section Macrophylla, Wolfe postulates, is closely related to the Asian sections, and details several endemic sections throughout the range of Acer. However, Wolfe was using vicariance in a non-cladistic sense, including climatic differences and dispersal as vicariant events. Oterdoom (1990) briefly described Acer dispersal, and confirmed Wolfe's (1981) ideas, particularly the close association during the Miocene of eastern Asia and North America. Our analysis has attempted to identify underlying cladistic vicariance events, but at the resolution of these data in their current form, any underlying patterns are hidden by a combination of incorrect fossil identification at the section level, over-broad biostrati- graphic assignment and very widespread taxa. As- sessment of sectional status even among extant Acer is difficult, and when doing so for extinct Acer specimens it is much harder. To compound the inaccuracies many of the original PFR records had to be discounted because their biostratigraphic range was too great to be any use to this analysis, and even the ones used caused problems by having stratigraphic ranges that overlapped two study age groups (see table 2). None of the patterns of the area cladogram in this analysis show any conclusive patterns of biogeography and do not disprove the idea that the cladistic vicariance patterns have been obscured by many separate dispersions back and forward between conti- nents (Wolfe &amp; Tanai 1987; Wolfe 1981; Oterdoom 1990). This analysis will be repeated using a greater number of areas in the hope that this will separate taxa more completely by geography and thereby facilitate the identification of underlying biogeographic pat- terns.

CONCLUSIONS This paper brings together about 3000 published data on the occurrence of fossils assigned to Aceraceae in the northern hemisphere. Their distribution is set out on palaeogeographic maps and time curves for different global regions, and then the data are compared to results from cladistic analysis of modern and fossil morphologies. Our results show the likely place of origin of the group and its migration patterns through the Tertiary. They also suggest that any divisions of the clade into morphological groups of fossils older than about 35 Ma BP cannot be justified; that is the first part of the group's evolution does not show up in evidence that enables us to reconstruct any details. However, in the Neogene, sections of the group do comprise geo- graphical and morphological entities. This may mean that the Aceraceae were busy establishing their genotypic identity until about 35 Ma BP, and that this did not show up in a stable or differentiated phenotype until later.

This hypothesis may also account for the high altitudes favoured by the earlier plants from the group, and for the migrations patterns shown here to have been across quite high latitude land bridges which would have been relatively cool territory for their time. Our palaeogeographic plots show clearly that the group first came to prominance around the Pacific rim, most likely at high altitudes during the Early Tertiary. We hesitate to cite a first appearance because the fossil record is very incomplete and there is also a strong possibility that members of the clade were pheno- typically unstable in their Late Cretaceous forms, as were the ancestors of so many other Arcto-Tertiary plants during adaptation to new ecosystems (Chaloner 1994). In the Eocene it is not possible to see vicariant development; for example, we have not been able to find evidence of one section developing on one continent and another section elsewhere. However, it seems that by Oligocene times the major evolutionary developments were complete and important morpho- logical variation was evolved and distributed. sections are found from then onwards on every major continent of the northern hemisphere. In this study, with very much more data available than ever before, our results show no clear patterns until about 35 Ma BP when Recent structures start to show up. If our fossil record is in any way reliable the first half of the clade's existance comprised amorphous morphological charac- ter sets: the details used by modern taxonomists were still evolving.
