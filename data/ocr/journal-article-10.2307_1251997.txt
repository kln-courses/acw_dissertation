<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stephen Brown Marketing and Literature: The Anxiety of Academic Influence Literary criticism, according to leading theorist Frank Lentricchia, involves striking texts together to see if they spark. Although many scholars have successfully struck marketing texts together, the sparks they have produced pertain primarily to marketplace phenomena rather than the academic marketing literature itself. Drawing on Bloom's "anx- iety of influence" thesis, this article strikes together the published works of two prominent marketing thinkers, Theodore Levitt and Morris Holbrook. It argues that far from being positioned at opposite ends of the academic spectrum-pure versus applied-they are, in literary terms at least, precursor and ephebe, father and son, one and the same. The business executive should realize that the highest form of achievement is always art, never science, and that business leadership is an art worthy of his own respect and the public's plaudits. -Theodore Levitt, Innovation in Marketing n recent years, marketing and consumer research has been enlivened by the advent of perspectives predicated on the liberal arts in general and literary theory in particular. Thanks to the pioneering endeavors of Russell Belk (1986a), Elizabeth Hirschman (1990), Linda Scott (1990), and Bar- bara Stern (1989), among others, it is now widely acknowl- edged that significant insights into marketing and consumption phenomena may be obtained by means of the tools and techniques of literary criticism. Substantial though these achievements have been, there remains ample scope for additional research activity. Just as many aspects of the marketing discipline have yet to be investigated by theorists armed with the apparatus of literary appreciation, so too lit- erary criticism is replete with theoretical approaches and schools of thought that have not been brought to the atten- tion of the academic marketing community. The purpose of this article is to contribute to this grow- ing "marketing-and-literature" literature by applying the techniques of literary theory to the marketing literature it- self. Although some may consider such an objective super- fluous or unwarranted, the oft-excoriated state of marketing scholarship suggests that an examination of academic writ- ing practices is long overdue. Rather than lacerating mar- keting researchers for their literary shortcomings, however, this article adopts a purposely positive perspective by offer- ing a detailed, theoretically informed "reading" of the pub- lications of two of the leading lights of marketing letters. More specifically, it applies a hitherto neglected (by mar- keting scholars) literary perspective, Harold Bloom's (1973). "anxiety of influence" thesis, to the seemingly contrasting Stephen Brown is Professor of Retailing, University of Ulster, Northern Ire- land. He thanks three anonymous JM referees for their helpful comments on a previous draft of this article. yet strangely consonant published works of Theodore Levitt and Morris B. Holbrook. The article commences with a brief summary of the literary literature in marketing and makes a case for literary analyses of the academic marketing corpus. It continues with a consideration of Bloom's celebrated anx- iety hypothesis and seeks to show how it is compatible with the academic publishing process per se. The essay culmi- nates in a comparative reading of the literary oeuvres of Levitt and Holbrook, and it concludes with a succinct dis- cussion of some methodological and epistemological issues. Although this liberal arts-inflected approach may be unfa- miliar to many marketing academicians, the article adheres to "standard" social science writing practices (introduction, review, method, analysis, limitations, and conclusion) and eschews the extreme forms of textual "defamiliarization" that are prevalent in contemporary literary theory. This arti- cle, in short, is not an exercise in righting the wrongs of mar- keting writing, nor is it a postmodern display of self-indulgent textual pyrotechnics; it merely seeks to inter- rogate the work of two much-published, widely read, osten- sibly antithetical marketing scholars and thereby demonstrate the utility of literary analyses of the marketing literature, as well as the potential for further research. Marketing and Literature It is now more than a decade since Russell Belk (1986a, p. 25), quoting Sennett, suggested that "one can learn more ... from a reasonably good novel than from a 'solid' piece of social science research," and in that time, many literary analyses of marketing and consumer phenomena have been conducted. At the risk of oversimplifying an intricate and multifaceted subfield of marketing scholarship, this body of published research can be divided into two broad categories: marketing in literature and literature in marketing. The for- mer, as its appellation implies, involves analyses of market- ing artifacts portrayed in works of literature. Examples include Friedman's (1991) longitudinal investigation of brand names in best-selling works of postwar popular fic- tion, Spiggle's (1986) studies of social values in comic books and underground comix, and Hirschman's (1990) use Journal of Marketing Vol. 63 (January 1999), 1-15 Marketing and Literature /1</page><page sequence="2">of Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities to illustrate her hypothesis on secular immortality (see also Belk 1996; Brown 1995a; McCreery 1995). The literature in marketing perspective, by contrast, involves applying the tools and techniques of literary criticism to marketplace phenomena, advertising and promotion in particular. Thanks largely to the close reading skills and, indeed, sheer industry of Stern and Scott, many schools of literary theory have been pressed into marketing service, including New Criticism (Stern 1988), Archetypal Criticism (Stern 1995), Psychoanalytical Criticism (Stem 1990), Feminist Criticism (Stern 1993), Reader-Response Criticism (Scott 1994), Structuralism (Levy 1981), Marxism (Hirschman 1993), Poststructuralism (Scott 1992), and Deconstruction (Stern 1996), to name but the most prominent. Despite the manifold achievements of the marketing literati, it is not unreasonable to suggest that much work remains. Because the merest fraction of the western canon has been culled by marketing researchers to date-world literature, in fact, is almost totally untouched-there are ample opportunities to extend the marketing in literature perspective. The future of literature in marketing appears equally bright because there are many schools of literary theory that have not yet been employed in a marketing context. These range from such prominent latter-day criti- cal positions as New Historicism (Veeser 1992) and Post- colonialism (Boehmer 1995) to the recent Auto- biographical turn, a stance that seeks to resurrect the author, whose "death" had been precipitously announced by the Deconstructionists (Simpson 1995; Veeser 1996). Another possibility, and the one that is pursued in this ar- ticle, involves what may be termed the literature in mar- keting literature perspective, that is, applying the tools and techniques of literary appreciation to the academic mar- keting literature itself. Such a suggestion is certain to ruffle a few, possibly many, scholarly feathers. After all, it raises the specter of "the specter of science being compromised" (Varadarajan 1996, p. 5), even though marketing's claim to scientific sta- tus is by no means universally acknowledged (Anderson 1994; Kavanagh 1994). More pragmatically perhaps, the very idea of critical self-examination seems somewhat ex- cessive, not to say narcissistic. Although there is undoubt- edly a need for literary analysis of the works of, say, Shakespeare, Shelley, Yeats, or Emerson, it is not only ir- relevant to the academic marketing situation, but also wastes valuable time, energy, and resources that would be better spent disseminating the marketing message or inves- tigating practical, cutting-edge issues such as networks and relationships. Marketing academics, as one commentator makes abundantly clear, have better things to do with them- selves than study allegory in Aaker, dialogism in Day, em- plotment in Parasuraman, humor in Hunt, litotes in Lutz, symbolism in Sheth, versification in Varadarajan, or ca- cophony in Kotler (Brown 1997). Understandable though this disquiet undoubtedly is, a case nonetheless can be made for literary analyses of the marketing literature. First, analogous critical exercises are not uncommon in adjacent academic disciplines such as an- thropology, sociology, psychology, history, politics, geogra- phy, and economics (e.g., Agger 1989; Barnes and Duncan 1992; Geertz 1988; Lukes 1995; McCloskey 1990; Schama 1992). Such undertakings, admittedly, are comparatively rare in the broad field of business and management, but if longer-established social sciences consider their writings worthy of study, the rationale for marketing's continued re- luctance is unconvincing at best and unconscionable at worst. Second, it often has been asserted that practicing mar- keting managers do not read the academic journals, and the publications they do peruse contain nothing of value (Deni- son and McDonald 1995; Rau 1996). This commonplace critique of marketing scholarship doubtless is grossly exag- gerated (researchers readily testify that practitioners read their publications with profit but seem to have problems with everyone else's), and some would argue that the con- tinuing managerial orientation has served to constrain the overall development of the discipline (e.g., Belk 1986b; Hirschman 1987). If, however, a degree of practitioner dis- quiet is conceded and if, as Kerin (1996) repeatedly avers, "the advancement of science and practice" remains the mis- sion of the marketing academy, then it behooves scholars to examine, consider, and possibly modify the various modes of marketing expression that prevail in the pages of the principal periodicals. Third, an important facet of marketing scholarship- and scholarship generally-is that the bulk of academic output consists of works of literature. The companies, in- stitutions, organizations, managers, salespersons, agents, households, shoppers, consumers, samples, surveys, inter- views, attitudes, intentions, behaviors, concepts, models, and theories that academics typically encounter are entire- ly textually mediated. Although such literary constructs ultimately may correspond to some phenomena in the "re- al" world, these marketing artifacts only exist through sev- eral by no means transparent layers of textual tissue (published articles, draft papers, data analysis, computer printouts, interview protocols, respondent representations, methodological guidelines, existing literature, textbooks, and so on). Marketing scholars, like it or not, are players in the literary game, and given the tools of literary criti- cism that are readily available, it seems perverse not to ap- ply them to at least part of marketing's compendious published corpus. Fourth, the final and, in many ways, most compelling point about the marketing literature is that, by ignoring the very literariness of academic writing or pretending that mar- keting prose is purely prosaic, researchers do themselves a disservice, undersell their abilities, and hide their literary lights under a banausic bushel. There is, to be sure, a small number of extant analyses of the "dark side" of academic marketing discourse (e.g., Durgee [1991] and Stern [1990] on Ernest Dichter, Thompson [1993] on the notorious "real- ism versus relativism" debate), but it is important to recog- nize that there are also some very gifted writers, poets, and literary stylists in the marketing academy, including Belk, Hirschman, Sherry, Stern, Zinkhan, and, as shall be consid- ered in detail shortly, Levitt and Holbrook. Perhaps it is time to take a positive approach to marketing poetics and cele- brate its papers, books, theses, dissertations, articles, essays, 2 / Journal of Marketing, January 1999</page><page sequence="3">and monographs, rather than continuing to suffer from mar- keting manuscript myopia. The Anxiety of Influence By any reckoning, Harold Bloom must be considered one of the foremost, if not the foremost, literary critics in the western world. Sterling Professor of the Humanities at Yale, he has written more than 20 books, edited approxi- mately 30 anthologies, and, as general editor of the Chelsea House literary criticism series, contributed more than 350 introductory chapters. His meteoric academic ascent com- menced at the comparatively early age of 29, when he pub- lished a radical reinterpretation of Percy Bysshe Shelley, a poet whose work was regarded by the then New Critical or- thodoxy as unworthy of serious consideration, let alone canonization. This challenge to the critical elite was swift- ly followed by a complete reassessment of the Romantic movement, a torrent of theoretical texts in the deconstruc- tion-dominated decade of the 1970s, and, of late, a magis- terial sequence of mature works, most notably The Western Canon, that engage with the mainsprings of "the great tra- dition"-the Bible, Homer, Shakespeare, and so forth (Bloom 1994). The principal reason for Bloom's singular status is that he has taken a commonplace of literary criticism-the no- tion that authors are influenced by the publications of their predecessors-and completely rethought, reimagined, rein- vented, and, not least, renamed its basic premises (Allen 1994; de Bolla 1988; Fite 1985). Prior to Bloom's revolu- tionary reinterpretation, the standard assumption was that literary influence consisted of borrowings from or allusions to the work of earlier writers (Bate 1970; Renza 1995). By means of close textual study, moreover, it was possible to identify and evaluate the influence of, say, Homer on Virgil, Spencer on Milton, Milton on Wordsworth, and so on. The great tradition thus consisted of a progressive sequence of additions to and assimilations of poetic precursors, a cumu- lative standing on the shoulders of literary giants, which at- tained its apogee in the Modernist movement of the present century. Drawing, however, on an idiosyncratic admixture of Freudian psychology, Nietzschean nihilism, and cabalis- tic codices-what Bruss (1982, p. 285) rightly terms "the subterranean underside of western rationalism"-Bloom formulated an agonistic, antagonistic, antithetical, and, if truth be told, at times almost incomprehensible interpreta- tion of the forerunner-newcomer relationship. In essence, this anxiety of influence thesis posits that neophyte poets struggle to define themselves against the crushing weight of their "strong" predecessors. Suffering the agonies of "belatedness," the primal fear that their pre- cursors have already said all that can be said, thereby leav- ing no room for literary laggards such as themselves, the would-be poets subconsciously engage in head-to-head con- flict, a figurative life-or-death struggle, with the established, anxiety-inducing titans. Just as sons are oppressed by their fathers, who must be symbolically slain in the Oedipal tri- angle, so too the ephebe poet challenges his overshadowing antecedent by a process of radical "misreading" or "mispri- sion" (literally mis-taking). This represents an aggressive assimilation, a drastic distortion, a systematic remolding of the predecessor's poems in the oeuvre of the novitiate. The newcomer, then, writes in a way that reshapes, reworks, re- casts, and ultimately replaces the achievements of the pre- cursor. All poems, in other words, are misinterpretations of earlier poems, attempts to clear a space in the literary firma- ment for strong but anxiety-stricken arrivistes (Bloom 1973, 1975a, b, 1976, 1982). For Bloom, the belated poet's bid to best his betters consists of six separate, sequential stages of development. Termed "revisionary ratios," and aptly described as "full of abracadabras" (Baldick 1996, p. 177), these stages are clinamen, tessera, kenosis, daemonization, askesis, and apophrades. Clinamen is a poetic misreading or mispri- sion, in which the ephebe endeavors to correct a perceived error in the predecessor's poem through a revisionary "swerve" or sidestep. Tessera requires the identification of something incomplete about the forerunner's corpus, which then is brought to antithetical fruition in the work of the newcomer. Kenosis comprises the tyro's attempt to break with the precursor by disavowing his own and, by implication, the father figure's poetic powers. This leads to daemonization, a movement toward a personalized countersublime, based on a "higher power" than that em- ployed by the antecedent poet. Askesis commences the re- turn to the predecessor by means of a purgatorial period of isolation and retreat into the self. "Burdened by an imag- inative solitude that is almost a solipsism" (Bloom 1973, p. 15), the ephebe finally enters apophrades, in which the progenitor is transcended and subsumed, so much so that it almost seems as if the earlier poet's work is a subset of the later's, as though the latter had actually composed, or made possible, the former's signature accomplishments. Despite its terminological arabesques, Bloom's basic framework is comparatively straightforward and, as Bruss (1982) rightly observes, appears to be predicated on the ar- chetypal triadic pattern of glory-fall-recovery that is a staple of the western literary tradition, from ancient myth and me- dieval fairy tale to television miniseries and blockbuster Hollywood movie. Indeed, though the anxiety thesis con- centrates on pugnacious intergenerational conflict, it is im- portant to appreciate that the poets involved may not perceive it that way. The life-or-death struggle is not only metaphorical but also unconscious, insofar as the creative efflorescence of the ephebe is inspired by the accomplish- ments of the precursor. (The inchoate poetic impulse is in- side the adept but precipitated by outside factors-Bloom describes this epiphanic sensation of discovery-cum-destiny as being "flooded" or akin to a "rebirth.") The neophyte's at- titude to the father figure, furthermore, is essentially am- bivalent, an uneasy amalgam of love, admiration, and envy, coupled with undertones of rivalry and hate. Thus, the be- lated poet unthinkingly palisades his own imaginative space by reading the parent poem in a revisionist manner or, strange though this may seem, by not reading it at all. How- ever, because he cannot avoid the precursor's influence, even by ignoring it, the best the ephebe can hope for is to write in such a strong manner that he assimilates the work of the forerunner and creates the illusion of primacy. In these admittedly counterintuitive circumstances, in which the Marketing and Literature / 3</page><page sequence="4">"meaning" of any poem is, in effect, another poem, the place of the critic is to practice what Bloom terms "antithetical criticism." That is to say, literary critics must read each poem as its author's misreading of an earlier poem, or of poetry in general, and just as strong poets are doomed to misread, so too are strong critics. For Bloom, all criticism is prose poetry and all poetry versified criticism. The anxiety of influence thesis is undoubtedly convolut- ed, unfailingly extravagant, and utterly incomprehensible in places, albeit no more so than the author-excising afflatus of the Deconstructionists. Yet a moment's reflection suggests that it is not entirely irrelevant to the academic marketing context. The published reflections of the discipline's intelli- gentsia unfailingly draw attention to the inspiration provid- ed by, and debt of gratitude owed to, an illustrious predecessor (e.g., Bartels 1988; Hirschman 1996; Hollander 1995). True, these remarks may simply be rhetorical con- vention, because failing to acknowledge one's mentor im- plies rampant egomania; nevertheless, the ephebe- predecessor relationship is a widely accepted aspect of aca- demic life. Equally ubiquitous, albeit much less frequently discussed, is the profound anxiety that many tyro scholars feel on entering the field (see Graham and Staeblin 1995). As "everything" has already been said on the subject of, say, brand choice, impulse purchasing, or the internationaliza- tion process-or so it seems-how can they possibly con- tribute to the conversation or clear a space for themselves in the great marketing scheme of things? Indeed, some form of intellectual space clearing is a standard trope-arguably the standard trope-at the commencement of almost every pub- lished academic article. Introductory paragraphs are replete with spatial-cum-positioning expressions such as "gap," "lack," "silence," "situate," "open up," "lacunae," "caesura," "surprising omission," "strangely neglected," "curiously overlooked," "contribute to the body of knowl- edge," "add to the growing stream of research," and many others besides. More important perhaps, failure to employ some form of space-clearing literary device suggests that a contribution is not being made, and if that is the case, there is no compelling rationale for publication in the first place. It is also an axiom of intellectual life that publications, as Bloom disconcertingly maintains, mean next to nothing in themselves, because they only really exist in relation to others. As papers unfailingly are positioned relative to the extant body of knowledge (not to do so, again, invites im- mediate rejection), their meaning actually comes from say- ing what the existing literature does not say (Agger 1989). After all, to say what has already been said is to say noth- ing (hence, the oft-lamented lack of published replication exercises in marketing, though from a Bloomian perspec- tive, this absence makes perfect sense). Similarly, to say what has never been said is to say nothing, because there is no body of work-there are, in effect, no standards, no cri- teria-against which the worth of the contribution can be assessed (hence the outcry and astonishment that greets genuinely original publications, such as Gould's [1991] much criticized [Wallendorf and Brucks 1993] "self- manipulation" article). If this line of argument is accepted, then even the most extravagant aspects of Bloom's theory no longer seem as farfetched as they first appear. It is arguable, for example, that it is not strictly necessary to have read Philip Kotler's corpus to be cognizant of his massive, overshadowing influ- ence throughout the field (Meamber and Venkatesh 1995). As the sea of Kotler-clone textbooks amply testifies, he has set the terms of discourse for that particular component of the marketing discipline's domain. His unavoidable author- ial presence determines not only what can and cannot be said about marketing management, but also the manner in which what is deemed sayable is in fact said. Likewise, the illusion of primacy, in which the present appears to precede the past, is nowhere better illustrated than in the recent, much-lauded relationship marketing paradigm shift. Ac- cording to Sheth and Parvatiyar's (1993) historical overview, relationship marketing was actually the primal form of marketing prior to the transactional lapse that tran- spired sometime in the 1960s and '70s. Their article is both a wonderful expropriation of the archetypal glory-fall- recovery schema and an interesting endorsement of the "marketing and literature" standpoint, because the authors actually employ Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice as a key piece of corroborative evidence. In truth, if the anxiety metaphor was pushed to its absolute limit, it could be con- tended that the process is all-pervasive in marketing. Apart from the marketing discipline's emergence from the rib of economics at the start of this century (which was accompa- nied by an oedipal desire to "kill" the father field by claim- ing to be more in touch with the "real world," as well as by modelers' latter-day attempts to reconcile the two), the the- sis is as applicable to marketing practice as it is to market- ing thought. After all, ephebe products, retail formats, sales promotions, pricing policies, and so on suffer under the in- tolerable weight of their "strong" predecessors and must su- persede their forerunners if they are to join the pantheon of marketing practice. Indeed, the widespread personification of products and proliferation of trade characters (Mizerski 1995) indicates that this consummately "literary" construct may well have considerable practical utility. The Marketing Pantheon Strictly speaking, however, the anxiety thesis does not apply to broad paradigmatic shifts in the tectonic plates of schol- arship, nor does it refer to the red-in-tooth-and-claw world of the marketing manager. It pertains, rather, to the literary endeavors of "strong poets," the undisputed intellectual ti- tans of the discipline. In this respect, there is likely to be considerable debate over who exactly constitute the "strong poets" of the field. Academic marketing, remember, has been in existence for more than a century, and during that time, various celebrated thinkers have occupied center stage-Charles Parlin, Paul Converse, Wroe Alderson, and Philip Kotler, to name but a few. However, for the essential- ly illustrative purposes of this article and in keeping with lit- erary criticism's characteristic desire to connect the seemingly unconnected, to seek unity in diversity, and to ad- dress ostensible differences rather than obvious similarities, attention shall focus on two distinguished scholars who are widely held to hail from opposite ends of the marketing spectrum, Theodore Levitt and Morris Holbrook. The for- 4 / Journal of Marketing, January 1999</page><page sequence="5">mer, virtually alone among the discipline's intelligentsia, routinely is referred to in commentaries on management gu- rudom as the voice, personification, and apotheosis of mar- keting and the marketing concept (Clutterbuck and Crainer 1990; Crainer 1995; Kennedy 1991; Micklethwait and Wooldridge 1996). Thanks to a string of seminal and much- cited papers, an extended sequence of provocative editorials in the Harvard Business Review (HBR), and a veritable cat- alogue of best-selling books and anthologies, Levitt is not simply primus inter marketing pares, but almost in an acad- emic league of his own. According to Kennedy (1991), "Marketing Myopia" (1960) is, at 500,000 copies plus, one of the best-selling HBR reprints of all time. Levitt's 1983 volume, The Marketing Imagination, has been translated in- to no less than 11 languages. Another anthology, Innovation in Marketing (1963), won the annual Academy of Manage- ment Award for best business book, and Levitt has had more articles published in HBR than any other management guru, winning four McKinsey Awards for best paper along the way. For many practicing managers, Theodore Levitt is more than a skillful advocate of the marketing cause; he is marketing. If Levitt is the personification of marketing scholarship for many nonmarketers, Morris B. Holbrook is the personi- fication of "scholarship" within the academic marketing community. W.T. Dillard Professor of Marketing at Colum- bia University, N.Y., Holbrook is perhaps the discipline's most outspoken opponent of managerial orientation-the widely held belief that business schools exist to serve the perceived needs of businesspeople-and most articulate ad- vocate of marketing research, pure research, for its own sake. His one-man campaign against the philistinism of practitioners, as well as their manifold academic apologists, has been waged in a series of monographs, reviews, essays, and books, most notably Postmodern Consumer Research (Hirschman and Holbrook 1992), The Semiotics of Con- sumption (Holbrook and Hirschman 1993), and Consumer Research: Introspective Essays on the Study of Consumption (Holbrook 1995). Granted, Holbrook's own arrestingly writ- ten accounts of these endeavors suggest that he has stag- gered from resounding defeat to resounding defeat-he frequently warns others not to follow in his footsteps-but a long and distinguished record of publication in the premier academic outlets suggests otherwise. As one cynic has co- gently observed, "Morris has published more papers on the problems of getting published than the rest of us have pub- lications" (Brown 1997, p. 204). On the surface at least, Levitt and Holbrook could not be more different-sheer productivity, illustrious careers, and the admiration of their peers aside. The former epitomizes the pragmatic end of the marketing spectrum. Despite his august academic base in possibly the world's most presti- gious business school, Levitt writes short, punchy, and largely citation-free articles for and about practicing man- agers in parapractitioner-orientated publications, principally HBR (see Levitt 1963, 1969, 1983, 1991, 1993). His care- fully crafted textual persona is that of a cracker-barrel man- agement philosopher, a purveyor of wry, homespun, horny-handed, no-nonsense, seat-of-the-pants, nontheoreti- cal, eminently implementable pearls of marketing wisdom. Readers almost imagine him in a rocking chair on a balmy southern porch, idly whittling, chewing tobacco, and expec- torating gobbets of practical advice to a circle of admiring practitioners. Holbrook, in contrast, is not only an erudite exponent of the impractical and unimplementable, but also the author of long, learned, intellectually challenging, cita- tion-strewn articles about abstruse philosophical, literary, and aesthetic issues in a wide variety of nonpractitioner-ori- entated journals (e.g., Holbrook 1990a, b, 1991, 1996a). His equally carefully crafted textual persona is that of the urbane urbanite, a widely read, if sometimes less than worldly-wise, denizen of literary salons, art galleries, bijou restaurants, chic shops, fashionable therapists, and avant-garde, off- Broadway productions. In short, he seems to be the arche- typal East Coast intellectual-cum-culture-vulture-cum-art- for-art's-sake aesthete. Parallels and Correspondences Closer inspection, however, indicates that Levitt and Hol- brook are not polar opposites, but one and the same, precur- sor and ephebe, father and son. This parallel is nowhere better illustrated than in their respective textual personae. The important thing to appreciate about these presentations of self is that they are literary constructs-the "real" person may be quite different, though they may find it necessary to play the part for public consumption-but in both cases, the authorial self is brilliantly constructed out of the most un- promising material. Levitt is a leading academic authority in a leading academic institution, yet he manages to portray himself convincingly as a practical man, an ordinary Joe, one of the guys. This portrayal, paradoxically, is reinforced by the cerebral milieu from which he hails, thanks to his pe- riodic denigration of woolly headed academics and their im- practical ilk. Holbrook, conversely, has successfully donned the mantle of the cosmopolitan, high-brow man of letters, even though as a marketing academic from a business school he occupies a position that, in cerebral circles, would be considered irredeemably boorish, unspeakably philistine, the lowest of the literary low. Marketing may be a noble aca- demic pursuit, with a long and distinguished record of con- ceptual accomplishments, but it is not perceived thus by the intelligentsia. Both Levitt and Holbrook, then, are demonstrably cre- ative writers-characterization is regarded as one of the hardest literary effects to achieve (Burroway 1996; Feldman 1996). Nevertheless, their ostensibly contrasting authorial personae only serve to divert attention from their often as- tonishing stylistic similarities. Prominent among these are the authors' sheer love of language, incessant wordplay, and, not least, vast vocabularies. Thus, Levitt's articles are re- plete with alliteration ("complex congeries," "fabulous fun- gibility," "vigorous vacuity"), para-Wildean epigrams ("clothes may not make the man but they help make the sale," "inaction is the only inexhaustible form of executive energy," "an effective manager develops the ability to hear what others are not saying"), and all manner of arcane-cum- idiosyncratic words ("protean," "incubus," "abjure," "mu- nificent," "crescive"). Indeed, he is quite capable of concocting neologisms if the cadence of the sentence calls for it ("vendables," "informational," "ineffectualness," "er- Marketing and Literature / 5</page><page sequence="6">rorlessly," "vertglomerate"). The same is true of Holbrook, for whom, in addition to alliteration ("egocentric eccentric- ity," "esoteric endeavors," "fantasies, feelings, and fun"), aphoristic inclinations ("ask not what semiotics can do for marketing, but what marketing can do for semiotics"), ceaseless sesquipedalianism ("ailurophobe," "paean," "con- trapuntal," "parsimonious," "mein," "aforementioned"), and sheer inventiveness ("catarche," "ethology," "antibanausic," "kroywen"), etymological considerations and subtle shades of linguistic meaning are a constantly recurring feature. In truth, Merriam-Webster is probably Holbrook's most fre- quently cited source. In a similar vein, both Levitt and Holbrook are masters of metaphor. The latter's career-spanning passion for ani- malistic conceits is perhaps his principal literary character- istic, and certainly the one for which he is best known. Among other symbolic creatures, Holbrook alludes to and draws inspiration from elephants, birds, gorillas, turtles, fish, dogs, roaches, and, above all, cats (Holbrook 1995). Not only does he playfully portray himself as "Morris the Cat" (Holbrook 1997a), but he has written at length about purported personality differences between cats and dogs and the lessons these contain for scholarly endeavors (Holbrook 1989, 1990a). Levitt is equally, if much less ostentatiously, inclined to indulge in tropeography. Although animals ap- pear fairly rarely-though he alludes to Berlin's famous hedgehog-fox distinction, notes Napoleon's rabbit versus lion leadership analogy, and at one point refers to "cat-like paws"-personification figures prominently in Levitt's fig- urative armory. He often makes insightful comparisons be- tween business organizations and the human body, be it in terms of growth, development, nutrition, disease, mortality, or interpersonal relationships ("the throbbing pulse of reali- ty the data sought to capture," "the industrialization of the service sector industries ... is just now crawling out of in- fancy and seems on its way to adolescence," "companies that don't metabolize information right will see small prob- lems and discontinuities metastasize into major maladies"). Games and activities are another major source of Levittite allusion-chess, checkers, poker, bridge, dance, music, and baseball-as indeed they are to Holbrook, whose climactic conclusion in his recent philosophical proclamation is pred- icated entirely on a bathetic footballing analogy: "One might recapture, however evanescently, that brief but boundless moment of ecstatic insight in which fleeting truth crashes in around us, arrested in mid-flight by the urgent grasp of our wildest lunging embrace" (Holbrook 1995, p. 368). As the preceding passage suggests, another literary trait that Levitt and Holbrook have in common is hyperbole. Both are such arresting stylists that their sheer writing abil- ity sometimes seems to get the better of them. This gives rise to passages of prose that, if not exactly purple, certain- ly contain more than a hint of mauve. Levitt routinely makes exaggerated comparisons between the lower-level employ- ees of nondescript marketing organizations and the creative giants of western civilization, as well as the occasional leg- endary figure (Cellini, Mozart, Michaelangelo, Rubens, Handel, Prometheus, and so forth). Likewise, the undeni- ably laudable achievements of hamburger vendors, insur- ance agencies, plastics extruders, and sheet steel manufac- turers frequently are compared, without the faintest trace of irony, to those of Copernicus, Bernoulli, Boyle, Lavousier, Darwin, or Newton. Indeed, during his more extreme pas- sages of essayistic overdrive, Levitt teeters on the brink of tautology and alliterative absurdity ("the paradox that puz- zles and perplexes: precisely as the marketing concept has advanced over the years, so, perversely, has the irritation it's produced, even among its practitioners"). Holbrook is no less hyperbolic-if anything, more so-and as someone who has made a convincing case for adopting increasingly lyrical modes of marketing expression, especially when emotional considerations are at issue (e.g., Holbrook 1990b), he cannot be accused of failing to practice what he preaches. To cite but a few far-from-atypical examples: "in an academic world dominated by marketing researchers pre- occupied with buying, as opposed to consuming, consumer researchers face a lonely battle if they elect to sing about the tarnished vestiges of the perfect consumption that character- ized lost innocence;" "They have scraped away the barna- cles of utilitarian concerns, have escaped the perilous flood of managerial relevance, and have explored fresh woods or new pastures by developing approaches to the study of con- sumption that they see as intrinsically worthwhile and even joyful;" "Thus ... does it offer the beautiful vision of a tran- scendent moment in which, moved by honest integrity, an audience of music lovers-or students-might sit very still. And listen." Although some may consider such expositional efful- gences to be almost as far from conventional social science reportage as it is humanly possible to be, they do not do jus- tice to the supreme literary abilities of both scholars and, taken out of context, may conspire to give the impression that the authors are little more than bombastic propagan- dists. To some extent, of course, they are-akin to many creative people, Holbrook and Levitt hold strong views on a range of (marketing-related) issues and are not reluctant to express them-but these opinionated excesses are leavened by their well-developed and immensely engaging senses of self-deprecatory humor. Holbrook often portrays himself as an uncoordinated, occasionally hapless incompetent, whether it be in his capacity as sportsman, scholar, handy- man, traveler, musician, collector, or cat wrangler, and is ever prepared to proffer amusing asides about the absurdi- ties of life in academia or the Big Apple (the roach invasion, standing in line at airports, McMarketing, the presubmission rejection letter sent to a colleague, autodriving his cat, and so on). Levitt's textual self is equally personable, thanks to his wry refusal to take himself or his gurudom seriously. Hence he "complains" about being an underpaid academic, even though his consultancy income must be astronomical ("as a certified academic, who is paid, however paltry the sum, to think, teach and advise"); he attacks professorial prolixity in prolix professorial prose ("literary obfuscation masquerading as wisdom"); he coins slogans about the mindless sloganizing of management gurus ("man lives not by bread alone but mostly by catchwords"); and he is quite prepared to recant on his earlier, vigorously articulated opin- ions, such as the centrality of marketing, the necessity for change, or the relative importance of large and small com- 6 / Journal of Marketing, January 1999</page><page sequence="7">panies, without so much as an apology, let alone a sheepish, gee-guys-I-got-it-wrong grin. On the contrary, his climb- down position seems to resemble "more fool you for taking the advice of an academic, you should have had more sense, you know what professors are like, you have no one to blame but yourselves" (see Levitt 1969, 1983). Alongside hyperbole, humor, and well-nigh heroic chutzpah, this literary duo shares several other textual char- acteristics that some more conventionally minded scholars may find disconcerting, distasteful, or indeed disingenuous. The first of these concerns sexuality. Again and again, Levitt makes risque remarks that might have been permissible in decades past but are regarded with much less equanimity to- day ("The age of the blind date or the one-night stand is gone. Marriage is both more convenient and more neces- sary," "not the cold figures in our intended's balance sheet but our warm feelings about our intended's figure," "the middle-aged man today wants to believe that he still has a good fighting chance for the occasional conquest ... he does it in part by dieting and by sartorial fastidiousness. The same is true of women. They feel forced to remodel themselves into grotesque apparitions of attractive youthfulness, if only to keep their restless husbands from roaming after more gamey prey"). In fairness, he frequently goes out of his way to venerate the "housewife" and seeks to excuse his para- sexism by asserting that the books are written for a predom- inantly masculine audience, which is true. Nevertheless, these priapic passages can only have served to reinforce the phallocentric propensities that have long pervaded, and con- tinue to pervade, marketing scholarship (Fischer and Bristor 1994). Holbrook, likewise, is nothing if not libidinous, and in addition to his openly acknowledged acquisition of semi- porographic magazines and videos, he has volunteered many detailed textual analyses of the relationship between consumption and concupiscence (e.g., the Plumtree's potted meat episode in Ulysses), as well as a lengthy retelling of his infantile Oedipal trauma (Holbrook 1988, 1991, 1993). Somewhat surprising, he also expresses astonishment at fe- male academics' apparent failure to respond positively to his espousal of the feminist cause (Holbrook 1995). Holbrook, of course, is likely to take umbrage at such a suggestion, though in so doing he merely exhibits another of his and Levitt's less captivating (if characteristically literary) textual mannerisms. Call it what you will-undue sensitivi- ty, touchiness, paranoia, narcissism, self-absorption, the artistic temperament, rampant egomania-but the personae of both Holbrook and Levitt come across as extremely thin- skinned. The former repeatedly rails against his maltreatment at the hands of malicious reviewers (e.g., Holbrook 1986a, 1996a), those conspiratorial persons who have gone out of their way to thwart his intellectual ambitions, often quoting them at length, and he rarely misses an opportunity to berate those who fail to pay appropriate tribute to his manifold pub- lished papers (cf. Colin Campbell, a distinguished British so- ciologist, for his ignorance of Holbrook's hedonistic paradigm). Likewise, Levitt has pursued a long, bitter, almost libelous textual vendetta against Tom Peters, the manage- ment guru who usurped his conceptual USP of customer- orientated organizations ("sweaty evangelist," "devout acquisitor," "evangelical zealot"), though the snake-oil sales- men of motivational research were given equally slanderous treatment at an earlier stage of his career as a management philosopher and pundit ("imprecise and artless," "as- trologers," "untrustworthy," "blind guessing," "rudimenta- ry," "sheer pretentiousness and gross negligence"). A final literary parallel between Levitt and Holbrook is their inordinate fondness for repetition. In addition to hav- ing anaphoric inclinations (that is, using the same words to start successive sentences: "I ask ... I ask ... I ask ... I ask," "And it worked, like magic"), both authors continually re- cycle their own work, albeit with minor editorial adjust- ments to suit the exigencies of the situation. Part of this propensity is attributable to the anthologization process- each has produced several "greatest hits" packages-but it also seems to reflect a shared belief that well-written pas- sages are infinitely recyclable. Thus, Levitt has a repertoire of stock phrases and aphorisms that he repeatedly plunders as the occasion demands ("what's new?" "fast history," "what needs to happen for that to happen?" "the solution to a problem changes the problem"). Holbrook is equally promiscuous with his prose, having rehashed his comments on Romanticism, his defense of subjective personal intro- spection, his explanation of the stereoscopic viewing process, and, not least, his celebrated cat versus dog com- parison, on copious occasions. So marked is this recapitula- tive inclination that both authors have developed what can only be described as signature textual stratagems, recogniz- able rhetorical devices that immediately signal the Hol- brookian or Levittite "presence." The former is characterized by aestheticized epigraphs, poetic inserts, and, above all, alliterative triplets ("ads, artworks, and aesthet- ics," "patience, persistence, and perseverance," "bears, Bal- timore, and baseball," "diversity, divergence, or diffuseness," "bombs, burnouts, and bigamists"), whereas the latter typically employs bold or outrageous opening statements ("Greed is boring," "Advertising works," "Nev- er leave well enough alone," "There is no such thing as a commodity"), incomparably racy prose (achieved by the use of "dynamic" adjectives and adverbial clauses such as "in- creasingly," "escalating," "relentlessly," "irresistible"), and, as often as not, homioteluton titles ending in ation ("global- ization," "industrialization," "pluralization," "youthifica- tion," "Chrystlerization," "differentiation," "imagination"). Notwithstanding their minor textual peccadilloes-stud- ies of supremely creative people often draw attention to their sensuality, sensitivity, and solipsism bordering on monomania (Csikszentmihalyi 1996; Eysenck 1995)-per- haps the most outstanding characteristic shared by Levitt and Holbrook is sophistry. Now, this is not to suggest that these distinguished marketing scholars go out of their way to mislead or hoodwink their credulous colleagues. On the contrary, Levitt and Holbrook are unquestionably sincere in their beliefs and are as one in their desire to convince the skeptics of the righteousness of their cause. Indeed, the prin- cipal reason behind the previously mentioned textual regur- gitation is a shared assumption that their message is sufficiently important to warrant continual repetition and re- inforcement. Nevertheless, after reading these authors' es- says, skeptics are left with a sneaking suspicion that sheer style has triumphed over mere content; that rhetorical slight Marketing and Literature / 7</page><page sequence="8">of hand has disguised the perceived shortcomings in the ar- gument, however minor; that they have anticipated any ob- jections and skillfully steered the readers away from such base and ignoble thoughts. Levitt, for example, often makes statements that seem entirely plausible, not to say com- pelling, in context, but when examined more carefully are inconsistent at best and impossible at worst (he variously stresses and dismisses the importance of packaging, pricing, differentiation, change, stability, youth, experience, small companies, large companies, information technology, and so forth). Similarly, despite Holbrook's formidable ability to assemble supporting evidence for his preferred subjective personal introspection procedure, the "sample of one" ob- jection is never quite overcome, and a faint air of authorial manipulation remains (see O'Guinn 1996; Otnes 1996; Uusitalo 1996). Again, this does not mean that Levitt and Holbrook are conceptual charlatans or con artists-quite the reverse. Yet, as with gifted stage magicians, these prestidig- itators of prose, these textual thaumaturges, these literary il- lusionists are suspected of somehow tricking their audience, which does not quite know how they managed to pull it off. Precursor and Ephebe Superb stylists though both scholars are, a parallel reading of their respective literary oeuvres leads to the inevitable critical conclusion that Levitt is a significantly better writer than Holbrook. Although the latter is widely regarded as the poet laureate of the marketing academy, there is nothing in the Holbrookian corpus to compare with Levitt's brilliantly evocative description of disgraced financier Ivan Boesky, "paraded before the public with ill-gotten dollars dribbling from his pockets," or his affectionate parody of the market- ing utopia portrayed in travel brochures "gloriously glossy pictures of elegant rooms in distant resort hotels set by the shimmering sea." When set against Levitt's featherlight evo- cations, especially his magnificent, less-is-more epigrams ("success comes to those who attack each task with the pas- sion of the scientist and the precision of the artist"), Hol- brook's prose seems ever so slightly ponderous, pretentious, pompous, and, on occasion, patronizing. Whereas Levitt wears his learning lightly and makes frequent allusion to works of scholarship, which his readership may or may not recognize ("The Marketing Imagination," "Marketing and its Discontents"), Holbrook feels obliged to explain every- thing, just in case the dullards in his audience do not get it ("note that Campbell's title plays on Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism"). The upshot is a blizzard of citations, quotations, and condescending commentary, which only serves to detract from his undoubted literary tal- ents. Even in his most poetic moments, Holbrook is prone to opt for an easy or derivative image ("as summer follows spring," "dance with the angels," "soar aloft on beating wings"), but unlike Levitt, who peaked early and trod liter- ary water for the bulk of his career, Holbrook has improved markedly with the passage of time and, eventually, eclipsed his poetic precursor. As a gifted writer, Holbrook must always have been aware-probably unconsciously, it should be stressed-of the immense creative shadow cast by Levitt. Indeed, there is ample evidence to suggest that Holbrook suffers, or has suf- fered, from the anxiety of academic influence. In describing his Presidential Address at the 1989 Association for Con- sumer Research conference-a speech, incidentally, that comprised the fullest expression of his aestheticized re- search agenda-he observes that "the structure of the situa- tion was perfectly calculated to give me heavy anxiety attacks, especially because, by the time I got my turn, almost every conceivably worthwhile thing had been said by my many distinguished predecessors" (Holbrook 1995, p. 260). This is as clear a statement of the anxiety thesis as could possibly be imagined. Holbrook, furthermore, has offered a vivid account of the "flooding" process (internal to the poet but brought to fruition by an external stimulus) that precedes the unrolling of Bloom's revisionary ratios. He reports that, during a prolonged period of Freudian psychotherapy in the mid-1970s, he discussed the frustrations of his academic ca- reer, dedicated as it then was to positivistic path analyses of automobile purchasing behavior. His ordinarily silent thera- pist asked why he did not investigate musical consumption activities-at the time, a nonscholarly yet personally fulfill- ing sideline-and this proved to be the turning point in Hol- brook's personal intellectual trajectory. Although the preceding may be deemed indicative of Holbrook's anxiety proneness, as is his repeated invocation of the structure, departure, and reconciliation stages of the creative process (the same primordial triadic schema on which Bloom's thesis rests), it does not establish an explicit connection with Theodore the Father. Granted, the anxiety model does not require a demonstrable association-the in- fluence is largely unconscious-but it does not rule out a di- rect linkage either. And, in this regard, there is some substantive evidence of an incipient precursor-ephebe rela- tionship. When Holbrook completed his Harvard BA in 1975, he applied for a position on his alma mater's MBA program but was spurned by the Business School, a rejec- tion that still rankles (Levitt was a lecturer at the time and shortly thereafter was appointed head of Harvard's market- ing division). His first publication was a caustic review of one of Levitt's books on selling, an attack that prompted a mortifyingly amiable response from the maligned author. For years, furthermore, Holbrook taught a course on strate- gy that used Levitt's marketing myopia as a starting point but then went on to demonstrate that total customer orienta- tion was a recipe for organizational disaster (Holbrook 1997b). More meaningful perhaps, it is possible to discern direct textual connections between Levitt and Holbrook. Apart from the broad stylistic commonalties noted previously, it is noteworthy that Levitt (1983, p. 49) actually used the some- what unusual noun "consummation," the terminological centerpiece of Holbrook's (1987) aesthetic vision, several years prior to his ambitious ephebe (ironically, in his cele- brated article on "globalization," a piece that Holbrook [1997c] recently has lacerated). Similarly, they are both prone to press esoteric words such as "paean," "avatar," "obeisance," "apotheosis," and "ratiocinated" into stylistic service, all of which are comparatively rarely encountered in the mainstream academic marketing literature. One of Levitt's signature stylistic devices (anadiplosis), which in- volves ending subsections with a word or phrase that pro- 8 / Journal of Marketing, January 1999</page><page sequence="9">vides the starting point for the next subsection, also is used by Holbrook, most notably in his landmark "What Is Con- sumer Research?" (1987) publication. Levitt, likewise, led the way with aestheticized epigraphs, matrix thinking (an- other favorite of the arriviste), and, not least, the alliterative triplet ("faith, fantasy, and new product failures," "moved, manipulated, or modified," "the Sphinx that thinks"). How- ever, perhaps the most obvious correspondence between precursor and ephebe is their incessant use of the first per- son singular and plural. Although this seldom is found-in- deed, is actively discouraged-in conventional social science writing, the prose of Levitt and Holbrook is ab- solutely replete with "I" and "we." Levitt, interestingly, makes much greater use of the second person than Hol- brook; it is this act of addressing "you," the readership, that gives his textual persona the man-of-the-people aspect that Holbrook's conspicuously lacks. Be that as it may, the essence of the ephebe-precursor relationship is found in the unfolding of the six revisionary ratios, which are predicated on the primordial trichotomous schema of affiliation, denial, and reaffiliation. The first two stages, clinamen and tessera, involve the identification of perceived shortcomings in the work of the precursor and the ephebe's attempt to bring things to antithetical completion. In the case of Levitt and Holbrook, these initial stages are very clearly marked. Notwithstanding his manifold publica- tions on manifold marketing topics, if the life's work of Theodore Levitt had to be synthesized, distilled, and placed in a proverbial nutshell, that nutshell would contain the words, "the customer is everything." The Levittonian mantra, that "the purpose of a business is to create and keep a customer," is chanted at some point in almost every one of his countless articles. Granted, he tones the message down on occasion, but from first to last, it is clear that Levitt con- siders the customer king. Holbrook (1997b), conversely, has been highly critical of this notion of total customer orienta- tion, recently going so far as to describe it as "illogical," "preposterous," and "exaggerated." However, not only are his own intellectual preoccupations equally explicit, emi- nently epigrammatic, and endlessly recycled, a la Levitt, but they also represent an antithetical extension of the latter's intellectual agenda. Whereas Levitt contends that the cus- tomer is everything, Holbrook cleaves to the view that everything is consumption. As far as the ephebe is con- cerned, everything from chewing a candy bar, to contem- plating works of art, to conceptualizing the deity's very act of cosmic creation represents a form of consumption activi- ty. Indeed, he has actually posited a 15-point scale of con- sumer "durables," which stretches from those that are consumed in less than a second (nanodurables) to those that last billions of years (megadurables). It can, of course, be contended that though Holbrook's "everything is consumption" is analogous to Levitt's all- embracing customer orientation, it can hardly be described as antithetical (though Holbrook [1995, p. 173] argues that it "differs fundamentally"). Yet a detailed reading of the au- thors' respective oeuvres reveals that their stated stances, though broadly consonant, are ultimately oppositional. Thus, Levitt frequently makes the point that, all other things being equal and even allowing for the occasional desire for novelty, consumer behavior is basically motivated by price, by the prospect of picking up a bargain. What is more, he in- tones on many occasions that people do not buy products so much as the solutions to perceived problems (people buy 4- inch holes not M-inch drills, hope not perfume, transporta- tion not automobiles, and so forth). If, conversely, the basic premise of Holbrook's position had to be summarized in a couple of sentences, it would be that there are certain things beyond price, that there are products, services, consumption experiences, and so on that are literally priceless and that are not solutions to banausic, everyday problems but worth- while, satisfying, and uplifting in and of themselves. Con- suming Hamlet, for Holbrook, is not a solution to the problem of an enjoyable evening's entertainment (though it can indeed be that), it is consuming Hamlet, and Hamlet alone, one of the incomparable artistic masterpieces of west- ern civilization. Despite this marked difference in emphasis, it is appar- ent that the "consumer is everything" and "everything is consumption" positions are broadly complementary, predi- cated as they are on some elemental notion of consumer ori- entation. In keeping with clinamen and tessera, the ephebe has performed a revisionary swerve and brought the precur- sor's work to an antithetical culmination. However, the sec- ond major phase of the anxiety of influence process, comprising kaenosis and daemonization, is characterized by a complete repudiation of the forerunner's scholarly stance and the articulation of a personalized countersublime premised on a "higher power" than that invoked by the an- tecedent author. This too is evident in the Levitt-Holbrook literary dyad. The former, perhaps more than anyone in the entire marketing firmament, has devoted his career to fur- thering the everyday lot of the marketing manager and, un- like many academic parapractitioners, can reasonably claim to have succeeded. Although Levitt has periodically pub- lished articles for scholarly consumption, he is the absolute embodiment of a business executive-orientated marketing commentator. In contrast, Holbrook's principal claim to fame, or rather notoriety, is his complete and unequivocal repudiation of the managerial cause. In a series of papers, panel discussions, personal appearances, and op-ed pieces during the middle-to-late 1980s, the ephebe ostentatiously eschewed the hitherto sacrosanct managerial ethos, though he completely failed to mention Levitt as the primum mobile of this particular intellectual position (an almost inconceiv- able yet, oedipally speaking, unsurprising omission). Not only did the aspirant strong poet contend that the concerns of marketing practitioners were no concern of marketing academics, but he actually reveled in his irrelevance and cel- ebrated the fact that his research was totally impractical, unashamedly nonfunctional, and, above all, utterly useless. Indeed, it was this issue that stimulated Holbrook's seminal categorization of researcher types: obedient, managerially orientated dogs versus free-spirited, unabashedly unbusi- nesslike cats. Naturally, Holbrook's wanton abandon of the manageri- al paradigm did not end with kaenosis. On the contrary, Morris the Cat contended that a higher position was avail- able to those happy few researchers of feline temperament who were prepared to endure the obloquy of their more pro- Marketing and Literature / 9</page><page sequence="10">saically inclined peers. Primed by his extensive analyses of aesthetics, artworks, and diverse forms of popular culture, which embraced everything from movies and Broadway productions to television game shows and rock music, Hol- brook (e.g., 1986b, 1993, 1995, 1996c) announced that the most meaningful countermeasure to the reductive, narrow- minded managerialism of the marketing scientists lay in consumer research in general and scholarship in particular. As far as he was concerned, the burgeoning subfield of con- sumer research was separate from, though related to, its par- ent discipline of marketing, and by breaking the ancestral connection, consumer researchers would be free to develop their own academic interests, unfettered by the (understand- ably) pragmatic demands of marketing practitioners. Above and beyond his perceived need for a named domain, Hol- brook, Bell, and Grayson (1989) championed a much more scholarly approach than had been apparent hitherto. Taking its cue from the humanities or liberal arts rather than the physical sciences, this romantic vision of scholarship rested on the assumption that "some truths may lie buried at a lev- el of human experience too deep for science to penetrate." For Holbrook at least, science was characterized by rigor, detachment, and rigid adherence to established methods, whereas scholarship was predicated on imagination, in- volvement, insight, and, above all, wisdom. In short, where science was narrow, scholarship was broad; where science was shallow, scholarship was deep; where marketing was scientific, consumer research was scholarly. Not everyone, admittedly, accepted Holbrook's distinction-it seems ex- cessive to insinuate that science cannot be practiced in a scholarly fashion (Pechmann 1990)-but as far as daemo- nization is concerned, Holbrook's science/scholarship di- chotomy is almost as clear as it gets. Paradigmatic though Holbrook's denial of his domineer- ing predecessor undoubtedly is, the quintessential instantia- tion of the anxiety thesis occurs in the third and final phase, which comprises askesis and apophrades. Askesis, as previ- ously noted, involves a purgatorial period of isolation and retreat into the self, so much so that it almost seems solip- sistic. It does not take a great deal of imagination, let alone scholarship, to recognize that this is a perfect description of Holbrook's (1996b) much-touted, much-debated technique of "subjective personal introspection." Unlike established approaches to positivistic and postpositivistic marketing re- search, with their methodological safety nets of representa- tive samples, member checks, standardized interview schedules, procedures, and so forth, subjective personal in- trospection requires the investigator to reflect on his or her own consumer behaviors and bring them together in the form of an extended autobiographical essay. Clearly, this procedure breaks all manner of "good research practice" guidelines, and it has been excoriated accordingly-often unfairly, it must be said (Campbell 1996; Gould 1995; Wal- lendorf and Brucks 1993)-but for the purposes of this arti- cle, the rights and wrongs of subjective personal introspection are less important than its exemplification of the askesis stage of the anxiety of influence. Although it can be argued that Holbrook's experiments in subjective person- al introspection commenced in the middle-to-late 1980s, and therefore coincided with the "denial" phase of the anxi- ety process, his nomination, articulation, and justification of the technique, qua technique, dates from the early 1990s. Holbrook freely admits, what is more, the purgatorial, Mor- ris-against-the-world character of his introspective ambi- tions and acknowledges that he often has been accused of solipsism or worse. Indeed, this preoccupation with self is amply demonstrated by his reaction to Wallendorf and Brucks' (1993) critique of introspection-they omitted to mention his contributions to the genre, which Holbrook in- terpreted as a personal slight-even though their attack was primarily aimed at another marketing scholar, Stephen J. Gould. After the solitude and self-absorption of askesis, the cul- mination of the anxiety trajectory transpires. In apophrates, the ephebe not only surpasses the overshadowing forefather, and thereby takes his place in the pantheon of strong poets, but also succeeds in suggesting that the work of the fore- runner is somehow subsequent to that of the ephebe. Para- doxical, not to say absurd, though this possibility appears, it is again clearly demonstrated in the Levitt-Holbrook liter- ary interaction. The latter's return to the former's fold began in the early 1990s, when he forsook his attempt to declare subdisciplinary independence for consumer research and re- focused on marketing matters, arguing that his "scholarly" approach had as much place in marketing as it did in con- sumer research. Having failed, furthermore, to convince the skeptics that a cogent scientific case could be made for the subjective personal introspection technique, Holbrook (1994) effectively let the scientific mainstream go hang and produced by far the most beautifully written article of his career, one that was short, straight from the heart, and just like Theodore Levitt, only better. Since the appearance of "Loving and Hating New York," he has published a series of articles from the "margins" of the discipline, lengthy book reviews, chapters in edited volumes and non-U.S. journals in the main (thereby paralleling Levitt, who, despite his stature among practitioners, has long been confined to the peripheries of academic marketing). More to the point, Hol- brook's (1996b, 1997c, 1998) latter-day intellectual obses- sion involves, incredible though it seems, stereoscopic photographs. Not only does this employ, exceed, and eclipse Levitt's seemingly unsurpassable metaphor of marketing myopia, but Holbrook's stereoscopic images appear most vivid to those who suffer from short-sightedness. Thus, the precursor's single most significant contribution has been taken, transformed, and transcended by the triumphant ephebe, the new strong poet, Morris the Catoptric. Discussion Catoptrics is the study of reflected light, and this study ar- gues that Morris Holbrook is a direct, if latent, reflection of one of the leading lights of postwar marketing scholarship, Theodore Levitt. Such a contention, suffice it to say, is somewhat contentious because Levitt is widely regarded as the embodiment of academic pragmatism and practitioner orientation, whereas Holbrook not only regards managerial relevance as beneath contempt but also unapologetically es- pouses an elitist scholarly ethos. However, Harold Bloom's anxiety of influence thesis intimates that these apparently ir- 10 / Journal of Marketing, January 1999</page><page sequence="11">reconcilable differences are actually an integral part of the father-son relationship, a quasi-Oedipal intellectual strug- gle. In literary terms at least, Levitt and Holbrook are close- ly aligned, and this article has sought to show, by means of a parallel reading of their manifold publications, that they share many syntactical propensities, thematic preoccupa- tions, and figurative peculiarities. More to the point, it has suggested that Holbrook, in keeping with the anxiety postu- late, has cast off the oppressive burden of his illustrious pre- decessor and taken his place among the strong poets of the marketing academy. Clearly, this precursor-ephebe connection cannot be "proved" beyond reasonable doubt nor convincingly demonstrated to the satisfaction of conventionally minded marketing academics. The suggestiveness of the textual in- terpretations aside, there is no "concrete" evidence of any kind to link Levitt and Holbrook (in fact, they have never met). Likewise, the decision to concentrate on Levitt and Holbrook cannot be defended on purely "logical" grounds or according to a clear-cut set of criteria that renders their works most deserving of detailed literary analysis (though they would doubtless score highly on any such inventory- influential, innovative, inspirational, and so on). Hence, it can legitimately be contended that this article lacks validity, reliability, objectivity, and replicability and completely fails to accord with recognized scientific criteria for marketing scholarship. This is indeed the case, but to dismiss the argu- ment on the basis of these (perfectly understandable) objec- tions is unreasonably precipitate. The whole point about literary analyses per se is that they are not scientific, they cannot be "proven" as such, and to ask them to meet stan- dard acceptance criteria is to apply the wrong standards. The question is not whether an exercise similar to the preceding is true or false or right or wrong, but whether it is interest- ing, imaginative, intriguing, impressive, inspired, incredi- ble, and inconceivable beforehand, but afterwards inescapable, indisputable, and inconsequential to the point of banality. As Lentricchia (1980) points out, the purpose of such analyses is to strike disparate texts together to see if they spark. Now, this is not to suggest that literary analyses of the marketing literature are sacrosanct or beyond censure. Quite the reverse. Apart from the all-important issue of whether informed readers actually consider the interpreter's interpre- tation insightful, irresistible, ineffable, inestimable, or what- ever, the theoretical underpinnings of the investigation are always open to question. Indeed, the history of literary crit- icism is littered with once-dominant, now-discarded (note, not refuted or disproved) conceptual frameworks. The anxi- ety of influence thesis is no different, insofar as it has been the butt of severe and unremitting disparagement. Part of this disapprobation is attributable to Bloom's unending em- bellishments, not to mention the sheer outrageousness of the anxiety model itself, but the framework also has been sub- ject to more substantive critiques that, irrespective of their veracity, have significant implications for marketing and consumer research. The first of these purported shortcomings is the theory's inherent androcentrism. Bloom repeatedly states that his anx- iety of influence thesis refers exclusively to male poets, to the father-son relationship, and he actually goes so far as to suggest that there are no women who qualify as strong poets. Not surprising, this contention has been subject to severe scholarly stricture, especially because Bloom does not have the traditional, if somewhat lame, excuse of writing in a pre- politically correct era. However, as the principal feminist ad- vocates of the anxiety hypothesis openly acknowledge (Gilbert and Gubar 1984), the unfortunate fact of the matter is that most poets are men and that creative women suffer less from the anxiety of influence than the anxiety of author- ship (in other words, a fear of writing in the first place). As Hirschman (1993), Stern (1991), and several others (Bristor and Fischer 1993; Costa 1994) have shown, this particular state of affairs also pertains in marketing, even though mar- keting, similar to literary studies, is a broadly "feminized" area of the academy (Brown 1997). It would be unfortunate, not to say pernicious, if the latter-day advance of feminist marketing scholarship-much of which emanates from the humanities-cum-literary end of the intellectual spectrum- were to be subverted by the lionization of masculinity in gen- eral and putative strong poets in particular. As Gilbert and Gubar (1984) make perfectly clear, however, it is possible to employ the anxiety thesis from a feminist perspective, and thus, there is no particular reason why it cannot be fruitfully applied in an academic marketing context. A second important challenge to the anxiety framework is that it ignores the synchronic in favor of the diachronic di- mension of literary meaning (Allen 1994; Bruss 1982). In other words, it is predicated entirely on the vertical, father-son axis rather than on horizontal, brother-sister relationships and thereby fails to take sibling rivalry into account. Although ambitious poets, writers, artists, and, in- deed, academics undoubtedly struggle under the crushing weight of their predecessors, they also compete against their contemporaries, the myriad potential contributors to each particular field of intellectual dreams. Bloom, admittedly, might reply that, as his theory only applies to "strong" poets, the issue of sibling rivalry is a nonissue, as strong poets by definition stand head and shoulders above the rest. Howev- er, in a compelling application of the anxiety thesis to Harold Bloom himself, Lentricchia (1980) contends that the champion of antithetical criticism is locked in a spirited, in- tragenerational struggle with his Deconstructionist siblings. (Bloom, remember, hails from Yale, the home of American Deconstruction, and was developing his hypothesis at the time of the Deconstructive "revolution" in literary criti- cism.) Certainly, the sibling rivalry variant seems highly rel- evant to the academic context in general, in which so many talented people compete for a limited number of "slots" in the premier journals, and to Levitt and Holbrook in particu- lar. It is arguable, for instance, that much of Levitt's vacilla- tion on the importance of globalization, entrepreneurship, and so on, as well as his unprovoked attacks on Tom Peters and motivation researchers, represent attempts to differenti- ate himself from copious competitors in the crowded field of management consultancy and comment. A skeptic, more- over, might surmise that Holbrook's repeated warnings to marketing researchers about the dangers of "feline" scholar- ship are designed more to discourage potential rivals than to provide avuncular advice to ambitious academics. Marketing and Literature /11</page><page sequence="12">Another, and in certain respects the single most discon- certing, aspect of the Bloomian program is that it represents a serious challenge to the marketing discipline's progres- sivist ideology. Instead of standing on the shoulders of gi- ants, of adding to the infinitely capacious font of knowledge, of getting ever closer to the "truth" about mar- kets and marketing, the anxiety hypothesis intimates that the intellectual shadow of the discipline's illustrious predeces- sors grows ever longer, ever deeper, ever more oppressive with the passage of time. According to Bloom, it becomes increasingly difficult for ephebe poets to find a voice, make a meaningful contribution, or add their names to the roll of marketing honor. The anxiety of influence postulate, in oth- er words, represents a trajectory of inexorable decline, re- gression, and degeneration. Although this may accord with contemporary concerns about marketing's purported failure, crisis, or demise (Lynch 1995; McDonald 1994), as well as with the prevailing postmodern intellectual climate of ennui, etoliation, and exhaustion (Brown 1995b), it is completely contrary to the marketing discipline's dominant ethos, which has been and remains strongly progressivist, ever on- ward, ever upward in orientation (Bartels 1988; Kerin 1996; Malhotra 1996). If the Bloomian stance is accepted, then marketing's greatest academic achievements already have been attained, the field will never again reach the heights it has reached hitherto, and marketing scholars are forever condemned to toil in the shadows cast by their prodigious forefathers. As with the long-departed .400 hitters of base- balling legend (Gould 1996) and, apparently, the titanic the- orymongers of the natural sciences (Horgan 1996), it seems that the likes of Weld, Parlin, Converse, Alderson, Kotler, and, above all, Theodore Levitt will never be seen again. Naturally, this is a disconcerting, if plausible, thought, but it should not be cause for existential despair or, worse, abject intellectual surrender. Morris Holbrook, after all, is living proof that it is still possible, when blessed with abili- ty, creativity, and sheer persistence, to transcend the tran- scendent, trump the triumphant, succeed the successful, and find a justly deserved place in the academic marketing pan- theon. Not everyone, admittedly, is capable of reaching the literary heights so successfully scaled by Holbrook and Levitt, but as this essay has endeavored to demonstrate, it is possible to study the published works of the marketing literati with profit. Profit, of course, "is a requisite, not a purpose of business" (Levitt 1983, p. 6), and it is important to acknowledge that literary analyses of the marketing liter- ature, necessary though they are, neglected though they have been hitherto, and ample though the scope is for addi- tional research, are ultimately the means, not the end, of marketing scholarship. Without reflecting on the means, however, the end is uncertain at best and unattainable at worst. Conclusion If, as Levitt (1963, p. 224) contends, "the highest form of achievement is always art, never science," it may be worth- while adopting a more aesthetic approach to marketing re- search than has traditionally been the case. Thanks to the sterling work of, among others, Belk, Hirschman, Scott, and Stern, considerable progress has been made in the "market- ing and literature" subfield. This article has sought to add to this burgeoning body of research by applying the tools and techniques of literary criticism to the marketing literature it- self. Informed by Harold Bloom's anxiety of influence the- sis, it offers a detailed interrogation of the literary oeuvres of two much-published marketing stylists, Theodore Levitt and Morris Holbrook. Despite their ostensible positioning at op- posite ends of the scholarly spectrum, the article contends that, in literary terms at least, they are father and son, pre- cursor and ephebe, alter egotists of marketing catoptrics. Some, admittedly, might conclude that this article is ir- relevant to the concerns of marketing practitioners or, worse, a complete misinterpretation of the textual evidence. The former charge can be countered in several ways that range from challenging the need for "relevance" in the first place, through managers' reputed dissatisfaction with con- ventional forms of academic expression (which necessitates self-reflection), to the patent interpenetration of marketing scholarship and practice. Not only is the anxiety thesis ap- plicable to marketplace phenomena, such as product posi- tioning or retail formats (especially in light of the anthropomorphic inclinations of marketing practitioners and advertising executives), but the corpus of academic litera- ture can be interpreted in marketing terms. The publications "market," after all, has its producers, consumers, channels of distribution, brand names, barriers to entry, competitive strategies, "stars," "problem children," relationships, net- works, segments, and so forth. The misrepresentation charge, however, simply cannot be refuted because the anxiety of influence thesis is predi- cated on the very premise that every reading is a misreading. This article is a misinterpretation, an absolute misinterpreta- tion, an unabashed misinterpretation, an unrepentant misin- terpretation. But it can be none other. The issue, in summary, is not whether it is a misreading as such but whether it is a meaningful misreading, a provocative mis- reading, a creative misreading, an imaginative misreading. As Levitt (1983, p. xv) so artfully observes, "no amount of marketing science or heavy analysis will work without the protean powers of the marketing imagination."
