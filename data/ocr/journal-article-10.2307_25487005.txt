<plain_text><page sequence="1">Leo Knuth A Bathym?trie Reading of Joyce's Ulysses, Chapter X "One thing alone is needful, the salvation of one's soul." Portrait 110 One of Joyce's achievements was the creation of a literary form which has been called "mimetic," "imitative," "expressive," or "immanent" ? a form expressing the quidditas, the "whatness" of the message. The term "symbolic" is extremely slippery and hard to define. But there is a semantic reciprocity between the text and the "correspondences" in Joyce s schema of Ulysses1 which may safely be said to be characteristic of symbolism. The "meaning" of the book and its raison d ?tre consist for a considerable part in discovering the bizarrerie of the interlacements between the "historical" plane of the naturalistic action,2 the structure, and the symbolic planes suggested by Joyce's schema. The purpose of this essay is to explore the organic interrelationship of these manifestations in "Wandering Rocks." Integrating the details that combine to form an all-embracing synthesis is a job which every reader has to do for himself. Once the process of grasping the overall pattern is completed, a total picture will emerge in which all the elements are inextricably interrelated in a kind of web or network, which is more easily depicted in a diagram than described in a discursive report. A linear description will give a dim reflection only of the climate of thought or feeling which affects us when we see the whole in its entirety, and which is necessary to experience the full impact of the ornate multivalence which is the characteristic out come of Joyce's horror vacui. The drawback of the linear exposition is that it is a ponderous and slow verbalization of what should take place in the mind in a flash, of what Joyce, in fact, called an "epiphany." The appended diagram A is an attempt to show the interrelationship of the various "correspondences" in Joyces schema, and create a favorable climate in which the outer and the inner forms can coalesce. Joyce's chart designates the Symplegades as the classical parallel, the labyrinth as the "technic," mechanics as the "art," and blood as the 405</page><page sequence="2">406 Leo Knuth "organ" of the chapter. There are two more labels that should be taken into consideration. One of them occurs in the litany of the Daughters of Erin (in "Circe"): "Sweets of Sin, pray for us" (1/498). The other label appears in "Ithaca," in the recapitulation of Bloomsday in terms of Hebrew rites: "Simchath Torah" (U 729). The Italian schema (ca. 1920) at the University of Buffalo gives the "color" of the chapter: arcobaleno (rainbow) ? the symbol of hope, which, however, I have omitted from my diagram. The chapter consists of 19 short sections, each with a different locale. The action takes place between 3:00 and 4:00 p.m. (the holy hour). One of the peculiarities is the occurrence of 32 heterotopic interpolations (fragments from certain sections interpolated in others), designed to cause the reader to lose his bearings ? which ties in with the labyrinthine technique. It is my contention that the structure of "Wandering Rocks" does not become meaningful until we succeed in establishing the reciprocal relationship between the various labels and the text. For instance, only after we have come to recognize the labyrinth as a symbol of man's quest for the hidden center do we see the significance of the con figuration of sections 1, 10, and 19. The locale of the chapter is the City of Dublin, which, with the Royal and Grand Canals encircling it on its north and south sides, and with the Liffey bisecting it along its west east axis, is virtually a circular labyrinth of streets. Bloom, who appears in the central section, finds himself at the topographical center, under Merchant's Arch, or near it. Father Conmee and the Viceroy, the representatives of the Church and the State, the two lawgivers to whom everybody is subjected, move in opposite directions, away from the center, the one going towards the northeast, the other moving towards the southeast. By extending the line of Father Conmee's northeasterly direction towards the southwest (pointing to Clongowes Wood, of which he is thinking) we can make the two routes form an X on the map of Dublin, with Bloom practically at the intersection of the two lines ? an X which ties up with the number of this chapter and with the cross symbolism with which it is permeated. Here is the semantic reciprocity I mentioned earlier. The labyrinth symbolizes the action and explains the configuration of the sections, while at the same time the action and the structure are determined by the concept of the laybrinth. (See diagramB.)</page><page sequence="3">A Bathym?trie Reading 407 The idea of the labyrinth as a symbol of life as a quest for the lost object, the Mystic Center, is of crucial importance.3 The various traditional iconographie symbols for the Mystic Center (circle, wheel, phallus, flower, and cross) are all relevant to our field of inquiry. Bloom's association with Odysseus is of less importance in this context than the symbolic implication of his name and his role as a messianic figure, more specifically his association with Christ. As a throwaway (suggested by his association with the newspaper he is carrying, with the handbill he is given, and with the dark horse that won the Gold Cup) Bloom is analogous with Christ, an analogy resting on Psalms 118:22, Acts 4:11 and I Peter 2:8. Bloom is repeatedly compared to a sheep and a fish, two well-known symbols of Christ. The most im portant structural clue, however, is the number 18. It is the number of chapters of which Ulysses consists. This is reflected in "Wandering Rocks," where we find the central section flanked by 9 sections on either side. The number 18 is written iota plus eta in Greek, which is also an abbreviation of the Greek name of Jesus. In addition, as David Toor has explained, the number 18 is a mystical number for Jews.4 It consists of two Hebrew characters, which also spell the word chai (life). Both interpretations combine to function as a sort of unifying structural device (cf. John 14:6 and also John 11:25, quoted by Mr. Kernan in "Hades"). Another important clue is more in the nature of a rebus or picture puzzle (a device which Joyce was to employ more frequently in Finnegans Wake), and links up with the crucifixion scene at the end of "Cyclops." Bloom, the central figure in the labyrinth, is flanked by an equal number of sections on either side, very much as Jesus is depicted on the cross in traditional iconography, flanked by symmetrically arranged beings and objects. The number of the central section can be written X, which is also the Greek chi, the initial of Christ. Both the Greek chi and the Roman numeral suggest the cross, and tie up with the number of the chapter. Numerous allusions and references to the cross seem to serve as road signs guiding the reader to the center. The words "cross" and "across" are repeatedly used. Even subtler allusions to Jesus' sacrifice are contained in Stephen's "Sacrifizio incruento" (section 6), in the references to Robert Emmet, who was "hanged, drawn and quartered," and to a man who "got his hand nailed to the table" (section 12), and in Simon Dedalus's enigmatic remark (in section 11): "I'll leave you all where Jesus left</page><page sequence="4">408 Leo Knuth the jews" (where did Jesus leave the Jews if it wasn't on the cross?). Mention is made of coffin-lids (sections 2 and 18), of cross-eyed Katey Dedalus (section 4), and of the three-masted schooner Rosevean (section 16) with her crosstrees (17 51). Another link in the chain of signposts to the central section is related to Blooms association with sheep and fish. His quarrel with the Citizen in "Cyclops," which led to his "crucifixion," was occasioned by his remark: "Christ was a jew like me" (?7342)* Referring to this incident (in "Eumaeus"), he thinks, "what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep" (17 658). In "Lestrygonians" and in "Circe" we learn that his nickname was "Maekerel" (U 162, 548). Once this association has become established in the reader's mind, references to sheep or fish will be recognized as allusions to Bloom (at least when the book is read again). In the opening section of "Wandering Rocks" the priest watches "a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind. Moutonner, the French said. A homely and just word." In a flashback he sees "a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey" (1/224). Since a sky showing the fleecy clouds that Father Conmee is looking at is known in English as a "mackerel sky," the passage serves as a roadsign guiding those who have eyes to see to the central section, where Bloom, the throwaway, a wandering rock of offense, invites comparison with that other commercial traveler, who was also rejected and set at nought. Bloom's messianic dimension is established in a variety of ways. The litany of the Daughters of Erin (T/498) provides an important series of links in the chain of associations that enables us to connect the protagonist of Ulysses with Christ. In the litany we find one of the labels for "Wandering Rocks": "Sweets of Sin, pray for us." Since Ulysses embodies a quest, and since Joyce placed the labyrinth, which is symbolic of the quest for the hidden center, in "Wandering Rocks," the obvious conclusion is that he wanted his readers to find the hidden key in the central section of this chapter. This section deals with Bloom's acquisition of a book, entitled Sweets of Sin. To reduce the title of the book (which Bloom brings home as a kind of sin-offering) to SOS, the telegraphic code signal of distress,5 will not seem like a figment of the imagination to the reader who is familiar with Joyce's preoccupation with letters, abbreviations, and riddles. Almost from the beginning of his career Joyce seems to have groped for a form which</page><page sequence="5">A Bathym?trie Reading 409 shows a close affinity with the most primitive type of literature: the riddle. The genuine riddle, of course, should provide a clue. I believe that Joyce planted the clue to SOS in the most obvious place. In "Calypso," the first chapter dealing with Bloom, we find him stooping to pick up Molly's book, which lay "sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot" (1/64). The symbolic implications of this round receptacle which, in Ulysses, is associated with the weaker vessel (whose "symbol," in "Penelope," is the earth) can hardly be over estimated. Its color facilitates association with the Gold Cup, another symbol associated with Molly. When an "S" is drawn in nine straight lines joined at right angles, it forms the motif of the Greek fret or meander adorning the rim of Molly's round article, so that SOS is as good a pictograph as any for the container under discussion. But there is more. Molly wants to know the meaning of a difficult word. ?Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. It's Greek: from the Greek. That means the transmigration of souls. O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words (1764). In plain words, these lines clearly hint at "Wandering Rocks, since "transmigration" derives from the Latin for "wandering," and suggest the relevance of SOS, because, when all is said and done, metempsychosis is the answer to the call for help: this concept, which fits in with the "art" of "Calypso" (economics), may be defined as the most economical way of preserving souls. Even the slang meaning of "rocks" is relevant, especially when we remember Stephen's remark about "those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise" (U 389), and are prepared to admit that Joyce delighted in combining the sacred with the obscene. Viewing SOS as a condensed summary of the quest theme, we may see it as a pictograph of the structure of the book. The central O imparts a sense of circular movement, which makes it an appropriate symbol of Bloom's Odyssey, and of cyclical return, which is relevant to Bloom's role as an avatar of Odysseus. The flanking "S's" refer to the first and last letters of the book: the initial one standing for the "Telemachia," whose protagonist is Stephen; the final "S" symbolizing the epilogue, which ends in Molly's voiceless sibilant losing itself in the silence of the night: "Yes." The ideas implied in metempsychosis and SOS merge with the concept of cyclical return associated with "Simchath Torah," the other label for "Wandering Rocks."6 SOS also</page><page sequence="6">410 Leo Knuth serves as a pictograph representing the symmetrical structure of the chapter, which is in a way a small-scale replica of the book, as Joyce told Stuart Gilbert.7 The symmetry of the Sweets of Sin section flanked by nine others on either side bears a resemblance to the symmetry of the code signal. The central "O" is also symbolic of Bloom himself, because his name suggests an emblem commonly used to represent the Mystic Center in iconography, with both religious and sexual overtones. That Joyce was aware of these overtones is apparent from "Lotus Eaters," which has the eucharist for its "symbol" and the genitals for its "organ" in Joyce's schema. At the end of "Lotus Eaters" (IL86) eucharist ("This is my body"), genitals, and flower coalesce into one image. To make assurance doubly sure Joyce planted another clue at the very end of the ninth section of "Wandering Rocks," at the juncture where this section flows into the center of the labyrinth. Here we find Lenehan gossiping about Molly and Bloom: He's a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He's not one of your common or garden . . . you know . . . There's a touch of the artist about old Bloom (t/235). Coming as it does at the moment when the reader is about to enter the central section, Lenehan's remark is ambiguous enough to arouse attention. It should be noted that "allroundman" is written as one word.8 Added to the vascular system (the "organ" of the chapter), which suggests circulation, and "Simchath Torah," with its suggestion of cyclical return, it evokes the picture of a circle. The observant reader will remember having come across a great many round objects in this episode. There are clocks and watches, beads and bells, eye glasses, round pillarboxes, wheels, cups and pots and kettle-lids, flowers and peaches and tomatoes, gaping mouths and ogling disks, the eucharist and a man named Love (zero), stars, the sun and the moon, hats and caps, cannonballs and coins of various kinds; there are ample curves ? and now we are about to enter Merchant's Arch, with which the arcobaleno of the Italian schema may well be associated. It is possible that Joyce wanted to remind the reader of the anthropo morphic imago mundi, a male figure with arms and legs apart, circumscribed by a circle, the center of which coincides with the navel (in his Italian schema Joyce had written "Punto Centrale ? Ombelico" over the correspondences belonging to the "Roccie Erranti"), or,</page><page sequence="7">A Bathym?trie Reading 411 more often, with the genitals. The phallus, too, as we remember, is an image of the Mystic Center. This association is relevant to Bloom's domestic problem ? "What to do with our wives" (U 685) ? and it links directly with the "organ" of the chapter, since blood is a necessary prerequisite of the male generative organ. There is, indeed, "a touch of the artist [Joyce] about old Bloom." The X-shaped figure of the imago mundi calls to mind the many allusions to the cross, which we discussed earlier. In passing it may be noted that Joyce was familiar with Agrippa of Nettesheim,9 in whose works he may have seen a picture of the anthropomorphic imago mundi. I have commented on the drawback of the linear exposition. A verbal analysis is rather like explaining a joke ? a thankless task. The comparison is apt, for Ulysses is, first and foremost, a witty book. Joyce's cross-correspondences are often amusing. A good example is afforded by the third section of "Wandering Rocks." A lame sailor is singing "The Death of Nelson" while he is in Eccles Street, on his way to Nelson Street (as we learn in an interpolation in section 16). A one-legged sailor singing about the "onehandled adulterer," as Nelson is called by Stephen in "Aeolus" (JJ 148). In "Circe" Molly's chamber pot is referred to as an "orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle" (1/547). Molly gives a penny to the sailor, as we are told in an interpolation in the second section of "Wandering Rocks" (U225) and in Molly's final monologue (t/747). "A woman's hand flung forth a coin over the area railings." The phrase "a woman's hand" recurs in "Ithaca" in a context which contains an allusion to I Kings 18:44. The appearance of "a matutinal cloud ... at first no bigger than a woman's hand" (1/667) recalls the cloud which will break the drought in the story of Elijah. Thus the themes of adultery and usurpation em bodied in the phallic pillar of the "onehandled adulterer" and the one handled chamberpot are tied together with the Elijah-is-coming throwaway, which is associated with Bloom, the victim of his wife's infidelity, who is engaged in a book-hunt which will result in a sin offering, as befits his role of suffering Messiah. It is evident that the streets of Dublin are the naturalistic equivalent of the intertwinings of the labyrinth. In addition Joyce has imitated these intertwinings in the text, which is strewn with reader traps of various kinds, such as the 32 heterotopic interpolations ? an allusion to the 32 counties, to the law of falling bodies: thirty-two feet</page><page sequence="8">412 Leo Knuth per second, and to the number of human teeth, a motif which will be discussed later. The impression of being in a labyrinth is reinforced by references to mirrors (in sections 11, 12, 15, and 18) and is structurally conveyed by many passages reminiscent of bilateral symmetry. A simple example occurs in section 15: On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descend ing, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending ([7246). A more elaborate example is found in the first section: On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S. J. of saint Francis Xavier's church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram. Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of saint Agatha's church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge. At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an out ward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island ([7221-22). This device is employed in different ways. For instance, a similar effect is created by a phrase occurring in one section mirroring an identical or almost identical phrase in another section. The d?j? vu sensation which the reader experiences is a characteristic feature of this laby rinthine technique. Several instances are to be found in the dislocated interpolations, such as Molly's arm in section 2, which reappears in its natural environment in section 3, or the bell-ringing lacquey in section 4, dislodged from section 11 where it properly belongs. A subtler in stance is the "listless lady, no more young" in Father Conmee's interior monologue ([7223). The phrase is echoed in section 10: "An elderly female, no more young ..." ([7236). The scene in which Stephen looks at the old print of Heenan boxing Sayers in section 13 is paralleled in section 18, when young Dignam looks at a poster showing two prizefighters. In section 4 the hungry Katey is dis appointed to find that the boiling pot on the kitchen range contains only shirts, while Lenehan (in section 9) refers to the annual Glencree dinner as a "boiled shirt affair." When Simon Dedalus (in section 11), annoyed at the bell-ringing lacquey, cries out "Curse your bloody blatant soul," he does not know yet that Ben Dollard (in section 14)</page><page sequence="9">A Bathym?trie Reading 413 will growl at him: "God eternally curse your soul" ? which, incident ally, forms an ironic contrast with the SOS theme discussed earlier. Sometimes these parallels appear to coincide in time. While Lenehan (in section 9) is molding "ample curves of air, Bloom, in the next section, is staring fascinated at a passage in Sweets of Sin: ". . . his hands felt for the opulent curves . . . ." There are many such instances in this chapter, which any reader can detect for himself. A kind of mirror symmetry of the entire episode appears to emerge when we allow the mirror line to coincide with the central section. The second half of the chapter repeats certain themes, motifs or objects of the first half in inverse order, transmuting directions, tones, or colors. The main characters of the first and the last sections re present the polar opposition of Church and State, "Cristo e Cesare" as it says in the Italian schema. It requires little ingenuity to see how sections 2 and 18 are linked by the image of the coffin and the char acters of Paddy Dignam s burier and his son and heir; how, in sections 3 and 17, the lame man and the blind man are linked by music; how section 4 is played off against section 16 by the contrast between poverty and affluence; and so on. The relationship between the concept of the labyrinth and the legend of the Symplegades is obvious. At the center of both is the idea of the quest. The journey of the Argonauts was a quest for the golden fleece of the ram that was sacrificed to Zeus. It is easy to see the connection with Bloom as a modern equivalent of the Agnus Dei. The labyrinth and the perilous passageway story are the architectural and the literary counterparts of a rite de passage. In this context the re ferences to birth, death, sex, and namegiving are significant. Those to birth and death require no special comment. As regards name-giving, the chapter is a perilous passageway for the reader, who is repeatedly being misled by Joyces nomenclatural ambiguities. Sex is probably the most prominent passageway theme. Seemingly innocuous passages reveal, on closer inspection, a sexual innuendo. Even the most naive reader will have no difficulty in recognizing the scene in the fruit shop (section 5) as a perfect locus classions on the subject of double entendre. But more important, though less obvious, is the role played by the handbill which is floating down the Liffey. This "throwaway" appears three times in our episode: appended to sections 4 and 16, and in the middle of section 12. It is the crumpled paper ball which Bloom threw into the river from O'Connell Bridge in "Lestrygonians" (U151). In</page><page sequence="10">414 Leo Knuth this passage the key words are "throwaway," "Elijah is coming," and "blood" (which is the "organ" of "Wandering Rocks"). Both "throwaway" and "is coming" acquire sexual connotation in the masturbation scene of "Nausicaa," after Bloom has become associated with Elijah at the end of "Cyclops." In "Wandering Rocks" the devious course of the handbill (the equivalent of the Argo in the legend of the Symplegades) should be noted. The first time we see it floating eastward, the second time westward, the third time eastward again. This back-and-forth movement is closely tied up with its function as a sexual symbol. It is interesting to observe how Joyce, who was always trying to integrate items into fragments of wider scope, succeeded in allowing the handbill to attain its sexual dimension. The throwaway is verbally associated with the Freeman s Journal which made its first appearance in "Lotus Eaters." In this chapter Bloom handed the paper to Bantam Lyons (who was seeking the betting odds on the Gold Cup race), saying that Lyons could keep it because he was just going to throw it away ([785-6). It is this incident that causes the brawl in Barney Kiernan's pub (in "Cyclops"), where the Citizen makes an abortive attempt to "crucify" Bloom, who is suspected of having collected his winnings on the erroneous assump tion that he had given Lyons the outsider Throwaway (the dark horse that won the race) as a tip. We are reminded of this "tip" in section 9 of "Wandering Rocks." Sceptre (the favorite), Throwaway (the outsider), and the Gold Cup, apart from their naturalistic surface function on the existential plane, serve as symbols forming an allegorical parallel with Boylan, Bloom, and Molly. In "Cyclops" both Bloom and the Gold Cup winner are called dark horses. At the end of "Cyclops" we witness the Ascension of "Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah" ([7345). The associative cluster involving the dark horse, the Elijah-is-coming throwaway, and Bloom's "rite of Onan" ([7 729) is established in the masturbation scene of "Nausicaa," after Bloom had "come." The way in which the Freeman s Journal is linked with this chain of associations is an interesting example of Joyce's technique of repeating a word in varying contexts, so that it acquires a particular connotation and becomes significant on the symbolic plane. In "Lotus Eaters" Bloom took the Freeman from his pocket and rolled it in a baton. The word "baton" recurs several times in significant contexts, in "Lotus Eaters," "Wandering Rocks," and "Sirens." It is in "Sirens" that the word definitely acquires its phallic significance. The scene is the bar of the Ormond Hotel;</page><page sequence="11">A Bathym?trie Reading 415 On the smooth jutting beerpull laid Lydia hand lightly, plumply, leave it to my hands. All lost in pity for croppy. Fro, to: to, fro: over the polished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) her thumb and finger passed in pity: passed, repassed and, gently touching, then slid so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding through their sliding ring ([7286). At this moment Boylan reaches 7 Eccles*Street. Bloom decides to leave the Ormond Hotel. "Can leave that Freeman." He gets up. By rose, by satiny bosom, by fondling hand, by slops, by empties, by popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze and faint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so lonely Bloom ( U 287). The phrase "by popped corks" connects Bloom with the handbill, which, in section 16 of "Wandering Rocks," "sailed" down the Liffey "amid an archipelago of corks" ( 1/ 249). Thus, by an intricate system of cross-correspondence, Bloom, the Elijah-is-coming throwaway, Throwaway (the dark horse), and the newspaper baton "which he had been about to throw away" ([7 676) combine to form a rich associative cluster. The sexual overtones of this cluster are linked up with religious overtones by two passages, one from "Aeolus," the other from "ithaca," which are molded in the same matrix. In "Aeolus" Moses is described " with the light of inspiration shinning in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw" (U 143). In "Ithaca," Bloom is described on his way to the baths, his newspaper baton under his oxter: "with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction" (17676). By molding the phrase "the secret of the race" in the same matrix as "the tables of the law" Joyce causes the Torah to partake of some of the associations engendered by the hippodromophallic pun contained in the word "race." At the same time the sexual meaning of the Freeman baton is augmented with religious overtones by the association with "the tables of the law." The cluster of associations is expanded further by the connection between "Simchath Torah" and "Sweets of Sin," the two labels for "Wandering Rocks." At first sight they seem to be mutually exclusive,</page><page sequence="12">416 LeoKnuth i because a sin is a transgression of the divine law. The apparent polar opposition need not be reconciled by having recourse to the coin cidentia oppositorum, for Joyce has built in a few hints that trigger off several associative impulses which enable us to equate "sin" and "law" via etymology and homophonic wordplay. The phrase "the tables of the law" is also the title of a work by Yeats. In Yeats's story the hero is incapable of sin because he "had discovered the law of [his] being and could only express or fail to express [his] being." As it happens, according to some etymologists, the word "sin" derives from a verb, meaning "to be," so that "Sweets of Sin" can be translated as "Sweets of Being" ? which would connect the phrase with the number 18 (Heb. chai, "life"). Also, Sin is the name of the ancient Semitic moongod residing on Mount Sinai, the prototype of Yahweh as a law giver. The cluster of associations, therefore, would seem to resolve into the following series of equations: sin = being (life) = Sin = the eternal Being, the fons vitae and fountainhead of the Torah. The Torah (see Note 6) conveys the idea of cyclical return, and can be tied up with the circulatory system of the blood, the concept of metempsy chosis, and the numerous references to round objects, evoking the image of the wheel, which emblematizes the "art" of "Wandering Rocks." The fact that the representatives of the Church and the State are assigned to the first and the last sections of the chapter emphasizes the importance of the law, as do the many references to the Four Courts, lawyers, and legal documents. Sweets of Sin is adumbrated in an amusing way in the first section. Father Conmee, who is reading the Nones in his breviary, has just come to the Sin section of Psalm 119 (118 in the Vulgate) when Lynch and his girl friend emerge from a gap of a hedge. He blesses them. Here is another instance of Joyces device of juxtaposing certain key words, which are like time capsules designed to operate in a designated configuration at a designated time. The significance lies in the jux taposition of Sin (or sin), sex, and blood (the word "bless," which occurs several times in this chapter, as does its antonym "curse," de rives from the Old Germanic word for "blood" ? its original meaning being "to sprinkle with blood"). The Semitic letter sin (tooth) seems to hint at the title of Bloom's book. Another hint is Artifonfs "? peccato" (Italian for "sin") in section 6. The meaning of the Hebrew letter sin is relevant. The word</page><page sequence="13">A Bathym?trie Reading 417 "teeth" occurs frequently in the chapter, and throughout the episode we find people smiling, laughing, grinning, biting, and chewing. Every time we meet Boylan he has a red carnation (a word derived from the Latin for "flesh," the "organ" of "Penelope"!) between his smiling teeth. Other references to teeth are Father Conmees "ivory book mark" and Stephen's "Agenbite of inwit." The allusion is lost unless we happen to know that the story of the Symplegades is an example of what folktale specialists call the vagina dentata motif.I0 The teeth also function as an emblem of the "art" of the chapter, which is reflected in the text by the interlocking device, whereby frag ments from one section are interpolated in another, like a system of toothed wheels. Again, they function on the psychological level by imparting a sense of danger, which fits in with the quest theme. There are, of course, several other allusions to the legend of the Symplegades, the most amusing of which is perhaps the one in the very last sentence of "Wandering Rocks." When "Almidano Artifoni's sturdy trousers" are "swallowed by a closing door," this is clearly meant as an allusion to the pigeon losing its tail and the Argo losing her rudder in the story of the Symplegades, but Joyce's parallel is also suggestive in terms of the vagina dentata motif. Compare Bloom's statement in "Circe" that "woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex" ([7 516). The word "valve" derives from the Latin for "door." There is always the danger of becoming enmeshed in one's associative processes, especially in the case of a writer like Joyce, with his tangles of allusions, his elaborate design of cross-correspondences, his employment of trompe-?oeil devices, false clues which we are ex pected to chase, instances of mirage and reader-traps of all kinds. Whenever the reader detects two items which seem to be related, he should look for a third which connects the two. Joyce generally provides the missing clue. For instance, a clue which links up the metempsy chosis theme with the sin motif is to be found in "Lestrygonians," where the key words occur in juxtaposition: "Karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pikehoses" ([7182). As to SOS, note the "tapping" of the bookseller in the central section (?7237), as well as the persistence of the letters in the references</page><page sequence="14">418 Leo Knuth to the Seal of Solomon, the quotations from Song of Songs, in "The Sorrows of Satan" (U 184) and in "Secret of all secrets" ([7242). The elaborate and complicated design of cross-correspondence was probably inspired by the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, which record many instances of automatic scripts taken down by different automatists. Joyce is known to have taken a particular interest in these papers.11 Taken in isolation these scripts are meaning less, but together they yield a coherent message. The fact that the SPR was founded in 1882, the year of Joyce's birth, must have intrigued the artificer who spent his life trying to discover the paradigm of what is called coincidence. It is possible to take the "capital esses" which Miss Dunne, "listlessly lolling," is scribbling on her jotter (in section 7) as referring to Shannon and Susy, of whom she is thinking. It is also possible, however, to regard Miss Dunne as an automatist, receiving snippets of a message distributed piecemeal among several automatic writers, the message being SOS. (But see Note 5.) Readers may more readily appreciate the points presented in my argument by reference to the diagrams appended to this article. I do not mean to suggest that any diagram of mine can reproduce the writer's associative pattern, which is beyond retrieval anyway. But, whatever they were, Joyce's associations must have fitted into his "philosophy," which found its final expression in Finnegans Wake. What Finnegans Wake appears to say is that, before the last blast of the archangelical trumpet, we shall all have had our turn in the great wheel of metempsychosis. Though unaware either of his role as an avatar of the mighty dead, Greek and Semite, or of his symbolic function at the center of the labyrinth, Bloom's search guides him to Sweets of Sin. The title synthesizes the two opposing forces in the intellectual climate of our culture: the Hebraistic consciousness of sin, and the Hellenistic awareness of beauty which leads to the pursuit of happiness of which the labyrinth is the symbol. A posteriori Bloom can repeat Farrell's "Coactus volui" ([7 250): a lex eterna willed him to will it. On the surface level Farrell's phrase sounds like the mad man's attempt to deny the sour grapes. I take it to be Joyce's way of suggesting that Farrell had passed the stage at which Bloom finds himself when hesitating between non voglio pi? servir and vorrei e non vorrei (U 64, 93). Forcing his reader's fancies to roam in the quaint mazes of his daedal art, Joyce seems to invite comparison with Satan's</page><page sequence="15">A Bathym?trie Reading 419 "I will" (Isaiah 14:13-14), which marked the introduction of the sweets of sin into the universe?the Minotaur at the center of the labyrinth that prompts man to say: Voglio, si opus sit (SOS). And sos is Irish for peace. . . The University of Utrecht The Netherlands NOTES 1. The versions of the schema Joyce gave to Stuart Gilbert, to Herbert Gorman, and to Sylvia Beach are practically identical. The Italian schema in the Joyce col lection at the State University of New York at Buffalo (MS. VA la.)shows a number of interesting differences, especially in the category "Colore." It also has an additional category, "Senso (significator)," which, for "Wandering Rocks," has the entry "L'am biente nemico." (See the Endoapcrs of Peter Spielberg's Catalog Buffalo: Univ. of Buffalo, 1962] and Richard Ellmann's Ulysses on the Liffeu [London: Oxford Univ. Press, 1972] ) 2. The "surface ' level of "Wandering Rocks" is naturalistic: the timing is exact (as Clive Hart has demonstrated), and so is the topography, except for a number of amusing dislocations, such as Merrion Hall becoming the Metropolitan Hall (presumably in Farrell's demented brain only), and the Grand Canal being transmuted into the Royal Canal in the section dealing with the viceregal cavalcade. 3.

The signal was unknown in 1904; it was adopted in 1912; "Wandering Rocks" was published in Little Review in 1919; Ulysses appeared in 1922. 6. Simchath Torah: the Rejoicing of the Law, a Jewish holiday celebrating the conclusion of the public reading of the Pentateuch. It is the celebration of a happy ending and a right beginning: immediately after the conclusion of the Law the first verses of Genesis are recited. Note that "Wandering Rocks" is the beginning of the second half of Ulysses. 7. I am indebted for this information to Mr. Roland McHugh, who had an interview with Stuart Gilbert on October 18, 1968, which he recorded in his diary two hours later (private communication in a letter, dated November 24,1970). 8. In "Eumaeus" the phrase is applied to Mulligan. Here it is printed as two words, "allround man" (17620). 9 Agrippa is mentioned in A Portrait and in Finnegans Wake, as was noticed before by James S.
