Dorset people, particularly the Late Dorset, c. AD 700-1300, have produced an art of significant quality, potency, and power. Dorset art constitutes one of the premiere museum collections in Canada, in any mode, genre or form. This paper examines the widely accepted view of Dorset carving as inextri cably bound with shamanistic practice. Focusing on "naturalistic miniatures," works of zoomorphic realism, it suggests these works may have been vernacular objects, common and part of everyday life, giving expression to the more mundane experi ences of people in the past. This makes them no less emblematic of Dorset social mores, habits, customs, and relations. Keywords: Dorset, archaeological art, shamanism, naturalism, realism Résumé : Les populations dorsétiennes, et en particulier les Dorsétiens tardifs, entre 700 et 1300 apr. J.-C., ont produit un art significatif au plan de la qualité, du pouvoir et de la puissance. Eart dorsétien constitue une des principales collections muséo logiques au Canada, dans tous les genres, formes ou modes. Cet article examine l'opinion largement acceptée qui veut que l'art dorsétien soit inextricablement lié aux pratiques chamaniques. En s'intéressant particulièrement aux « miniatures natura listes », des objets au zoomorphisme réaliste, l'article suggère que ces artefacts pourraient avoir été des objets vernaculaires, courants et intégrés à la vie quotidienne, ce qui exprimerait une dimension plus terre-à-terre de l'expérience des populations passées. Cela n'enlève rien à leur caractère emblématique des moeurs, habitudes, coutumes et relations sociales des Dorsé tiens. Mots-clés : Dorsétiens, art archéologique, chamanisme, natu ralisme, réalisme Silent Echoes of Culture More than 40 years have passed since William E. Tay lor and George Swinton's twinned, seminal articles on Dorset carving, published in The Beaver in 1967. Tay lor and Swinton engaged in a lively debate for the period of a year before committing their thoughts, impressions and analyses of Dorset art objects to paper. Their com bined program, under the shared title "Prehistoric Dorset Art," continues to form the basis of our current under standing of the tradition. A painter and professor of art at the University of Manitoba, Swinton adopted an artist and art historian's perspective, and studied the artifacts "as art, as experience, as expression" (Taylor 1967:32). In championing "The Magico-Religious Basis" of Dorset art, Swinton (1967:39) stated quite clearly: "I am reason ably convinced that most, if not all, Dorset art is not only magical, but probably highly specialized (and 'profes sional') shaman's art." He further developed his thesis that only a highly skilled artisanal class of "shaman-art ists," or "artist-shamans"—art workers well-versed in the forms and contents of Dorset traditions, and "who applied them in a carefully handed down traditional manner"— could have been responsible for the production of a cor pus of such coherency, consistency, "intensity and power" (1967:39). Speaking for Taylor as well, Swinton wrote: we should also like to suggest that the highly developed and exquisitely shaped objects are not the work of occa sional carvers, far less mere whittlings, but the care fully planned and considered work of specialists (either the shamans or their helpers) ... It is by no means unreasonable to conceive of a Dorset artist-shaman (or shaman-artist) as the main producer of such art. [1967:39] Taylor, then Director of the Human History Branch at the Canadian National Museum, played a crucial role in defining the concept of a Dorset culture in Canada (1959; 1962; 1965; 1968).

This has, in fact, remained the dominant perspective Taylor proceeded to quantify the "raw data" he and in commentaries on Dorset carving ever since. Elmer Swinton had under consideration: 56 objects from the Harp (1969/70:122), for instance, at Port au Choix in National Museum of Canada, 33 on loan from the Oblate northwestern Newfoundland, was also able to study Dor (now Eskimo) Museum in Churchill, Manitoba, a number set carving in intact archaeological contexts, including of photographs from archaeologists Harp, Maxwell and grave associations, and concluded after a nuanced discus Meldgaard, as well as illustrations from the literature sion: "we can also see that the Newfoundland art consists (Collins, Holtved, Mathiasson)—for a total of 125 objects, almost exclusively of amulets which relate to the prac 89 in hand. Taylor tended to be less gregarious, more tice of hunting magic." The art historian Jean Blodgett balanced and conservative, yet no less perceptive in his (1979:181), considering "face clusters" in Dorset carving, interpretations. Although the two wrote separate pieces, found multiple factors to "suggest that these items, like so so that, as Swinton (1967:32) reports, "my ethnological much—if not all—of Dorset culture art, were of a magico and archaeological speculations would not harm Taylor's religious nature."

McGhee (1996: 159) identifies this type of Dorset sculp ture as "naturalistic miniatures: tiny seals or walrus or bears, which, if they could be expanded perhaps fifty or a hundred times, would be almost perfect replicas of the particular animals portrayed." Meldgaard's observation (1960:26), that these small figures contain "no unneces sary details, and no ornamental lines," is important.8 For Maxwell (1985:127), these "tiny ivory animals are so nat uralistic and perfectly proportioned that they can appear monumental when photographically enlarged."

Many of these pieces are bilaterally symmetrical, and some "stand" foursquare, as with the muskoxen and a series of standing bears (Fig. 9).

As such, one might reasonably conclude that in the zoomorphic series there is little that speaks to sha manic ritual or to shamanistic magic. We can look more closely at two prominent themes in this type of carving, representations of bears and seals. Bears, after humans, appear to be the most represented subject in Dorset art, with seals following bears. Taçon (1983) found that human representations accounted for 18.73 per cent of the sample (162 of 865 pieces), bears 17.11 per cent (148 pieces), and seals 12.95 per cent (112 Figure 4: Owl. Shuldham Island 9, Labrador. Soapstone. 3.8 cm. Courtesy of The Rooms Provincial Museum Newfoundland (Collection no. IdCq-22-406). In sculptural terms and along formalistic lines, in these works of "zoomorphic realism" there is little sense of a contrast between various elements of the work. There is no play with proportions, and no meaningful differences in size (as there, for example, is in the small head and long neck characteristic of Dorset "flying bear" figures). In the sculptural arts, as Henry Moore has observed, "if a work is just as it is in nature, one part is not more import ant than another" (2002:109). In Moore's aesthetics, such naturalistic pieces are unexpressive, inartistic, and lack the imaginative interplay of the creative subject. Many Dorset zoomorphs are what Swinton (1967:39) would call "highly developed and exquisitely shaped objects," cer tainly; and yet in them we see no sign of a "leap" between incompatible elements, no play of unlike terms, no "place" where the work's expression is particularly concentrated, and thus where the viewer's gaze—the sculpture's lines of tension or force—tend to focus or converge. The over all effect is that the viewer is not compelled to discern "unfamiliar" relationships between different parts of the work. In short, this is not an art which appears designed to "shock" its audience, to convey a "disturbing" element, or to bear the signs of a struggle. The shaping power, vision or inspiration of the individual artist-subject does not dominate the material; there is no sense of a religious admixture or of the "subconscious" at work. It would seem then that there are no overt traditions of Dorset culture (philosophy, religion, metaphysics) that intervene to supersede or modify the naturalistic design of these Figure 5: Whelk.

In addi tion, the Dorset would prey on Ursus maritimus itself; on occasion the reverse would also be true. A polar bear, to a Dorset person without dogs or the bow and arrow, would be a formidable opponent. Bears were also almost certainly figured by the Dorset as potent spirit helpers, and numerous bear sculptures, often with a skeletal motif on their backs and a ventral belly slit, some times with traces of red ochre, may indicate the existence of a pan-Arctic bear cult (Larsen 1969-1970). In addition, however—and such is my focus here—McGhee reports on: occasional carvings of what appear to be individual Figure 6; Egg Shuidham Island 9&gt; Labrador. Soapstone. 2.5 cm. bears standing, swimming, or sitting like dogs. These By permission of The Rooms Provincial Museum, Newfound rare portraits, elegantly proportioned and with finely land (Collection No. IdCq-22:396). detailed faces, have the charm so conspicuously lacking in the images of humans. There is no hint that these objects had any other use other than to delight artists and their audience in the miniature portrayal of an ele ment of the natural world. [1996:164; emphasis added] This experience of charm (subjective, sensual, the product of a collaboration between viewer and artifact) is worth considering, as is McGhee's (embodied, present tense) perception of delight. With "no hint ... [of] any other use," the shamanistic principle appears to have little role to play in the interpretation of these pieces. Seal carvings provide another interesting case. There are a number of small, finely made carvings of seal that are so detailed that even the species can be identified. Maxwell notes that these: pieces are usually small but accurately proportioned and often have great anatomical detail. For example, the head of an ivory seal barely 5 em long recovered from the Tanfield site was cocked, as if, while lying on a floating ice pan, it has heard an approaching hunter. Its tiny eyes, its whiskers, and even its small anus are Figure 7: Dorset, Sitting Bear. Shuidham Island 9, Labrador, faithfully depicted. [1985:160] Soapstone. 4.4 cm.

We might think of this series of forms as expressing an "imaginative structure" that creates, elaborates and even houses a "conceptual framework"—certain structures of knowing and feel ing, "of attitude and reference" (Said 1993). This class of objects may represent or exemplify a "contract" or under standing between object, artist and audience, and can be said to constitute a genre, at the very least a subgenre, within Dorset carving. We might think about the way in which this subject matter is treated, and what this treat ment means. As Miller (1994) explains, if an artistic genre Figure 8: Bear head.

In this sense they would con stitute a fairly common Dorset social phenomenon (see Harp 1969/70; Jordan 1979/80; McGhee 1974/75).11 The ethnographic analogy often cited in support of this argument is Rasmussen's writings on the Netsilik and Iglulik of the Central Arctic, Inuit peoples whom he visited in 1923 on the Fifth Thule Expedition (see Harp 1969, 1974/75:40; Swinton 1967; LeMoine et al. 1995). Swinton, for example (1967:39), notes that, "Rasmussen continuously refers to such shamanic practices, as do Thalbitzer, Hawkes, Turner and, more recently, Holtved."

MacRae Anthropologic a 55 (2013)</page><page sequence="17">Finally then, what does the zoomorphic series come to teach us? I would suggest that, as in the Rabbinic interpretive principle, "the exception comes to teach us about the rule" (Alter 1992:31), to straddle the bounds and hence reveal the limits of an authoritative, exclusionary system. The zoomorphic series, if it is indeed exceptional, serves to loosen up the finely made and carefully closed order of Dorset prehistory, to shrug off and "dis-iden tify" the logic of the interpretative canon from its own overdetermined (read: magico-religious) formulation. As supplements to the canon, these pieces counteract the authority of prevailing tradition, and serve to activate an epistemological uncertainty already embedded within the archaeological record. They reveal some its possibil ities, a record of the variety of modes of expression that Dorset material culture already contains. The presence of the exception reveals the orientation—the structur alist imperative—that underlies dominant interpretive voices. This is to suggest that small, naturalistic Dorset animal carvings constitute another, alternative, possibly non-shamanistic tradition or trope which runs through the cultural ensemble. Ian J.

CMC Librarian Brigitte Lafond, and liaison Nathalie Guénette, were helpful. Lorraine Brandson, Curator at the Church ill Eskimo Museum, facilitated my research; as did Laila Williamson at the American Museum of Natural History, New York. Elaine Anton and Lori Parks were a pleas ure to work with at The Rooms Museum in Newfound land, where Kevin McAleese was generous with time and materials. I visited briefly in the Port au Choix collections with Patricia Wells and Priscillia Renouf at Memorial Uni versity in St. John's; and enjoyed research visits at The Princeton University Art Museum, with Bryan R.

Three anonym ous reviewers have strengthened the text in many ways. Errors and omissions are my own. Notes 1 Taçon (1983:56), following Esther Pasztory (1982), has use fully defined group (shamanic) rituals and practices, and those objects used during ceremonies and social ritual, as "shamanic art"—that which pertains particularly to the shaman (specific); and more general, individualized (sha manistic) practices, beliefs, and those art objects made by anyone working within "the cosmology or world-view of shamanism (general)." I too will take up these definitions in what follows. 2 "Most archaeologists believe that the ultimate roots of the Dorset artistic tradition lay in the Pre-Dorset Substage of the Arctic Small Tool tradition which dates circa 4200 and 2800 B.E" (Helmer 1986:181). 3 Please note that this paper does not directly address the categorization of Dorset art as such. Rather, I draw upon accepted, established, and relatively stable taxonomies, as represented in museum exhibitions and catalogues, aca demic work, and popular publications, in using "sculpture," "art," and "carving" more or less interchangeably here. 4 This ethnographic parallel is necessarily imprecise, but is now thought to be inconsistent as well. 5 As Davis explains, "Such losses constitute the discipline of art history just because they are the objects for its sub jectivity—not the artefacts in themselves, fossils with no intrinsic status, but rather the ways of their departings from art historians" (1994:153). 6 Maxwell is referring at least in part to Ronald J. Nash's work (1976), in which Nash categorizes Dorset, Pre-Dorset, and Thule cultures as Tightly Constrained Systems, which are "have a limited potential for adaptation to new variety and constraints ... the evolution of Tightly Constrained Systems is extremely slow and involves changes in forms more often than fundamental changes in structure" (Nash 1976:150-51). 7 While not every practicing archaeologist thinks precisely this today, the view remains foundational, I think, in the interpretive tradition. 8 These pieces do not contain "the skeleton motif" (Meld gaard 1960:24), an incised "X," lines or chevrons—what Swinton (1967:43) called recurring "crosses"—that are often taken to symbolize the bones and joints of the fig ure represented, and which is a recurring motif in Dorset art (Meldgaard 1960:15-16; Taçon 1983:50; McGhee 1996). This "common symbolic theme in the circumpolar world" (Helmer 1986:197) is generally linked to shamanic beliefs and travel, but is absent from the zoomorphic series. 9 Taçon (1983: 60) notes that, "the number of late Dorset art objects, although relatively great, is absolutely small." Harp, for example (1970:109), excavated 20 Late Dorset house pits at Port au Choix, yielding almost 23,000 speci mens, of which less than one per cent (189 specimens) were classified as art objects. 10 This taxonomization of Dorset carving is an interpretive strategy, at least in part an arbitrary distinction, as much as it is a characterization of the actual artifactual record. This need not negate the possible historical accuracy of this construction. Without such interpretive leaps we are bound to plough the same sea. Anthropologica 55 (2013) How Are We to Imagine Them?: Shamanism, Structuralism and The Zoomorphic Series /193</page><page sequence="18">Note that this would already constitute an evolutionary model, in that in Herbert Read's influential The Art of Sculpture (1956:24) the amulet is taken to be "from the beginning another form of art that was to merge with sculp ture," and that "the limitations and qualities" of the contem porary art of sculpture "are determined by the manageable dimensions and direct tactility of the amulet." Among the Dingus of Siberia, often cited as a possible com mon or ancestral source of Dorset shamanism, female sha mans are apparently as common as men. Women certainly could have been shamans, carvers, even shaman-carvers. We cannot propose experiments to test our hypotheses of Dorset art. There is no scientific account of art, and we cannot specify general criteria for judging what is art. References Alter, Robert 1996 Genesis: Translation and Commentary. New York: W.W Norton.
