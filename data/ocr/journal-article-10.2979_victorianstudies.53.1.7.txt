<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Paralytic Animation:   The Anthropomorphic Taxidermy of Walter Potter  Conor Creaney Over the course of a sixty-four-year career, Walter Potter constructed fourteen taxidermic tableaux, which came to be housed in a small museum devoted to his work. Each of these  glass-encased collections of suspended creatures is a farrago of taxi- dermy, sculpture, landscape painting, narrative, nostalgia, and whimsy,  the best-known being “the Kittens’ Wedding,” which was completed in  1890 and features, as the catalogue for its auction (occasioned by the  museum’s closing in 2003) puts it, “twenty kittens wearing either morning  suits or dresses of cream brocade, complete with parson, altar and rail, in  a glass display case” (Contents 36). In ornate costume, posed standing on  two feet, these stuffed kittens enact a human wedding scene. A 1994  History Today article asks, “Is there a weirder museum in England, with its  stuffed kittens and grotesque freaks of nature?” (Cavendish 62). Visitors  to Potter’s museum in its last years often found the tableaux creepy or  morbid. As respect for the subjectivity and dignity of animals became  increasingly important in the twentieth century, the works began to carry  the taint of cruelty, even brutality. manipulating animal bodies to make  them seem to represent themselves as miniature humans was now often  read as an unacceptable over-writing of their primary identities. this  became something that the museum’s owners felt the need to explain  away; a sign was mounted saying that “none of the animals had been  killed specially and, anyway, they were all more than 100 years old”  Abstract: this essay examines taxidermist Walter Potter’s tableaux of preserved animals  in anthropomorphic poses. While easily dismissed as kitsch, these works collapse the  distance between the corporeal and figurative, illuminating our understanding of Victo- rian bodies and the techniques used to represent them. this essay reads two of Potter’s  tableaux as simultaneously a tribute to nature and a violation of it: they are limit cases of  an ekphrastic compulsion to bring the object of narration before the reader. the bodies  they contain are, borrowing Dickens’s phrase, “paralytically animated,” a state they share  with the bodies preserved by mr. Venus, Our Mutual Friend’s taxidermist. Examining  Venus’s and Potter’s overlapping features helps us to better understand the novel’s  worrying of the boundaries between literal and figurative, living and dead.

(morris “Animal magic”).1 But Potter’s work retained a capacity to disturb  viewers because taxidermy’s effects are ones of immediacy and presence;  the bodies are still here in front of us, seemingly alive. those who complained to the museum might have been struck  by the way in which “the Kittens’ Wedding” tampers with the bodily  sovereignty of these creatures for merely comic purposes, an affront  compounded by the highly ornamental anthropomorphic costuming.2  they might also have registered the work’s coercive relationship to the  bodies it displays: in its use of kittens—domesticated animals that have  not yet reached sexual maturity—the tableau enacts a ceremony that  conventionally restricted and delimited the sexual and reproductive  activities of its participants. Placed in the roles of mature human adults,  the tableau sexualizes the kittens at the same time that its ornately  rendered narrative promises to regulate the putative sexual impulses it  projects onto them. the violence the piece performs to their natural  physiognomic form by presenting them standing on two legs dramatizes  the fact that their bodies are no longer their own, and the decorative  human costume seems only to add the insult of anthropomorphic panto- mime to this injury. Our sense that the tableau is taking unwarranted  liberties might be heightened further by the temporal incongruity that  taxidermy generates: this event before us, despite having already   VICtOrIAn stuDIEs / VOlumE 53, nO. 1 </page> <page sequence="3"> PArAlytIC AnImAtIOn 9 Fig. 2.

Well-inten- tioned as it might be—and Potter is clearly fond of these creatures—the  work’s categorical clumsiness is damning: the taxidermist, in the attempt  to make humans out of animals, treats them as things and turns them  into grim, ossified commodities.  All of this said, the disturbance tends to be quite mild for most  viewers, and most recent responses to “the Kittens’ Wedding” might  be more accurately described as tending not toward visceral antipathy  or moral outrage but toward smug, amused horror. the piece reads  today as the over-decorative efforts of a well-meaning but undiscrimi- nating amateur, unable to see how kitschy his bejeweled little creatures  are. Elaine Freedgood’s analysis of our taste-based presentism when  encountering Victorian “thing culture” resonates with Potter’s work.  In its “profusion, intensity, and heedless variety,” it too “displays that  appalling lack of irony, of distance, of coolness that we so often cringe  at in the worst examples of Victorian middle-class taste” (158).3 And  yet, while this cringeworthiness is unavoidable, in what follows I will for  the most part read Potter’s works more earnestly, as texts that do a  sincere (and, yes, highly idiosyncratic) job of rendering the human  world. I’ll argue that, in their uniquely literal relationship to their  Autumn 2010 </page> <page sequence="4"> 10 COnOr CrEAnEy subject matter, they are multilayered artifacts in which the interplay of  form and content creates a distinctive set of ironies concerning the  relationship between Victorian bodies and the means by which both  texts and visual culture attempted to capture them.  to this end, I’ll first briefly situate Potter’s work in the context  of nineteenth-century understandings of animals (living, preserved,  and fictional), and then offer a more extended analysis of how “the  Kittens’ Wedding” collapses the distance between the corporeal and  the figurative. Finally, I will juxtapose Potter’s “Original Death and  Burial of Cock robin” tableau with Charles Dickens’s Our Mutual Friend  (1865), a novel that holds many of its bodies in a state of suspended  animation. the correspondences between the work of Potter and of  Dickens’s taxidermist, mr. Venus, are tantalizing and perhaps more  than coincidental; looking at Venus’s treatment of his own “poor little  Cock robin” (91) alongside Potter’s tableau can deepen our under- standing of the preoccupations that Dickens expresses in using Venus  as a figure for his own operations. Potter’s Cock robin tableau is a  limit case of an ekphrastic compulsion to bring objects of narration  before readers; considering the costs of this process will help us better  understand the novel’s persistent worrying of the boundaries between  literal and figurative, living and dead.  Potter was born in 1835, and lived his entire life in the village of  Bramber in sussex. He was the proprietor of the Castle Hotel in the  town, having inherited it from his father, and was, as his obituary in the  Sussex Daily News in 1918 puts it, “a valued public man” (2). that obituary  also tells us that “almost everybody who visits that favourite resort,  Bramber, drops in at that quaint and interesting little museum there,”  which “charms the youngsters and also appeals very strongly to grown- ups. . . . the unique exhibition with which he supplied the village was a  high testimony to his skill as a naturalist. It was his own, unaided work,  and he took the greatest possible pride and pleasure in it” (2).4 A twen- tieth-century visitors’ guide to the museum described it thus: the Bramber museum is the result of the lifetime’s work and planning of one  man. Begun as a hobby, Potter’s taxidermy epitomizes the almost fantastic skill,  patience and devotion which so many Englishmen bring to bear on the most  unlikely pursuits. It also epitomizes the Victorian love for the faithful imitation of  nature, and the desire to bring it into the home. Potter’s craftsmanship almost  transcends aesthetic values, and a visit to the museum will be found most  rewarding.

Its appeal remained  steady, attracting 30,000 visitors each year up to the time of its closing  (Contents 6).  the history of taxidermy is largely a history of a representational  technology learning to obscure its own operations, and Potter’s work,  despite bucking that trend in obvious ways, was subject to many of the  formal expectations of conventional taxidermy. the most important of  these expectations was that the works achieve a convincing approxima- tion of liveness. the nineteenth-century literature on taxidermy abounds  with discussion of the necessity of creating the illusion of life in the  preserved creature. In the early part of the century, there was little  danger of anyone mistaking a preserved animal for a live one; English  naturalist William swainson lamented in 1808 that mounted animals are  “deformed and glaringly artificial productions devoid of all of the grace  and beautifully tuned points of living nature” (18). As the century  progressed, techniques improved. montagu Browne’s 1874 Practical Taxi- dermy notes that the form had by that date advanced beyond the “old  wooden school of taxidermy” in which specimens were “outrages on  nature,” “stiff, gaunt, erect, and angular” (15). By 1896 one taxidermist is  described as being capable of instilling in the animal “the witchery of  pose and outline which charmed us in the wilds” (Goodson 78).  taxidermy, for these practitioners, requires a certain talent, a  capacity to observe and reproduce poses and attitudes in a realistic  manner. this ability is not universally distributed: as another taxi- dermy manual asserts, it is “an art which requires great taste . . . it  greatly depends on the imitative genius of the student” (tyrer 1). One  of the ironies of the form is that the best taxidermists’ authorship of  their pieces is masked by the realistic effects they generate. As Karen  Wonders notes, “taxidermic sculpture was relegated to the same low  rank as the wax replicas at madame tussaud’s—largely because of its  illusionistic success as a three-dimensional form of trompe-l’oeil; the  more real the mounted animal looked, the less evidence there was of  the artistic skill that created it” (24). Others were unconvinced, though:  an 1891 piece in Longman’s Magazine contends that “if assiduously  preserved from defilement and mutilation and insects, a well-stuffed  bird may possibly last for a century. long before that period has  Autumn 2010 </page> <page sequence="6"> 12 COnOr CrEAnEy elapsed it has become in the eyes of a lover of nature (as distinguished  from the student of natural history) as unlike a living bird as a mummy  is unlike a human being” (Graham 288). the “imitative genius” of the taxidermist was, for most of the  nineteenth century, mainly put to use in producing hunting trophies. A  second irony of the form, then, was that the animal body before the  viewer provided a tangible, indexical authentication of the act of killing  the animal while simultaneously purporting to represent the animal  alive, in the state of nature. taxidermy performs a temporal synecdoche:  as Jane Desmond suggests, it “animate[s] the animal body in time by situ- ating it in an implied narrative that includes moments ‘before’ and ‘after’  that which we see frozen in front of us” (160). In many hunting trophies,  this reprise of the creature’s former life was often embellished or fiction- alized: tusks and claws were sometimes pulled further out of the body  than in the animal’s living state, and fierce expressions and wild eyes were  added to suggest ferocity and dangerousness. Harriet ritvo observes that  “although the ostensible criterion by which such efforts were judged was  realism, in fact the most acclaimed taxidermy made its subjects seem  dangerous and powerful” (Animal 253). the obvious result of these mild  fictionalizations of the animal body was to amplify the viewer’s respect for  the hunter’s skills and the putative risks taken in the pursuit. As a writer  on taxidermy in the Great Exhibition argues, “viewed as the products of  labour—as the rewards for the hunter’s toil in deep, rugged forests, or  along the banks of unknown and dangerous streams—these trophies  become significant” (“Fur” 15). the stress on the “hunter’s toil” occults  the taxidermist’s mediating work in a manner common to many non- technical descriptions of taxidermy in the period.  the most enduring relatives of Potter’s tableaux are the  dioramas that are still to be found in natural history museums (institu- tions that didn’t exist until late in Potter’s career). By placing preserved  animals against painted backdrops and among vegetation appropriate  for their habitat, they provide the illusion of glimpsed reality. rather  than being about the single animal, this type of display attempts to  reproduce the experience of encountering an exemplary member of  the species in the wild, and elides the fact of the animal’s killing. It  invokes a mythological sense of scopic mobility in which the viewing  subject seems able to see into the remotest corners of the world. Donna  Haraway makes the point that this version of taxidermy is a close rela- tive of literary realism:  VICtOrIAn stuDIEs / VOlumE 53, nO. 1 </page> <page sequence="7"> PArAlytIC AnImAtIOn 13 taxidermy was about the single story, about nature’s unity, the unblemished type  specimen. taxidermy became the art most suited to the epistemological and  aesthetic stance of realism. the power of this stance is in its magical effects: what  is so painfully constructed appears effortlessly, spontaneously found, discovered,  simply there if one will only look. realism does not appear to be a point of view,  but appears as a “peephole into the jungle” where peace may be witnessed. (34) In combining the expertly preserved animal body with the mimetic  recreation of its habitat, the museum diorama offers a stable and  legible three-dimensional synecdoche of the world of nature. Haraway  and ritvo both characterize taxidermy’s version of realism as taking  pains to mask its own fictionality and, in the case of museum exhibits,  permitting itself local, contingent untruths only in the service of bigger  truths about the animals in their distant natural habitat. Potter’s works share with these examples the accurate preser- vation of the animal body but do not, of course, present a recognizable  mimetic version of the natural world. rather than conceal their own  fictionality, they derive much of their appeal (or such of it as endures)  from our perception of the unnaturalness of their activities and  habitat. What is key here is that their embodiedness is so powerfully  authenticating that it overrides (at least momentarily) our sense of the  impossibility of what we are seeing. Jane Desmond writes of similar  works of twentieth-century American “fantasy taxidermy” that “these  variations on the ‘realism’ theme were . . . dependent for their comic  power on the perceived authenticity of the animal body parts and their  incongruity with other body parts or fashion accessories.” she also  notes that “these neo-realistic fantastical creations undercut the  framing paradigm of realism while relying on it for their effects” (163).  the animal body, in all of these fantastical works, is the site of both a  realistic indexical authenticity and an incongruous, deliberately  fictional deviation from that putative realism.  the particular deviations performed by Potter’s most promi- nent forbear in anthropomorphic taxidermy, Hermann Ploucquet,  appeared to some acclaim in the Great Exhibition. On loan from the  royal museum in stuttgart, they depicted, as an 1851 Illustrated London  News review enumerates, “a party of tabbies drinking tea, a number of  large animals of the weasel tribe as sportsmen, with beaters of a smaller  species, hunting an unfortunate flock of hares, weasels fighting duels,  frogs walking genteely out with umbrellas, rabbits trying vainly to do  sums on slates, and cats singing and playing the piano” (“natural”  Autumn 2010 </page> <page sequence="8"> 14 COnOr CrEAnEy Fig. 3.

Ascot: mPm, 2008. used by  permission of Pat morris. 134). the exhibit also featured a number of cases reproducing the  illustrations from a German edition of Goethe’s version of the reynard  the Fox fable (see fig. 3). As michelle Henning observes, Ploucquet’s  tableaux differed from those of Potter by representing the preserved  animal as “not a natural animal but a symbolic one” (664). the incon- gruous doubleness of Ploucquet’s works reads to viewers as a comical  violation of the hierarchy in which humans occupied a higher position  than animals. the periodical press’s reaction to Plocquet’s work in the Great  Exhibition offers rare commentary on anthropomorphic taxidermy,  and the prevailing response was an enthusiastic celebration of the work’s  humorous incongruity. Dickens’s Household Words notes that “of those  that visit the Great Exhibition, few fail, after they come away, to talk of  certain cases from Germany which contain stuffed animals, and espe- cially of some exquisite groups illustrating the famous German fable,  ‘reinicke Fuchs’” (morley 484). One writer enthuses that “it is not often  that one comes across a scientist who is also what one might term a prac- tical humorist” (Fitzgerald 27), while the Illustrated London News reviewer  notes that “the animals are endowed with the strangest human expres- sion, and yet they are animals still,” and urges the reader “attentively to  study and note the curious degree of skill and drollery displayed in these   VICtOrIAn stuDIEs / VOlumE 53, nO. 1 </page> <page sequence="9"> PArAlytIC AnImAtIOn 15 most amusing caricatures of natural history” (“natural” 134). the Illus- trated Exhibitor observes that Ploucquet’s cabinets were “especially admi- rable, for while various characteristics of the different tribes are strictly  preserved, the attempt to represent them, as actuated by human motives  and passions, is irresistibly ludicrous. Herman Ploucquet must be a man  of no small humour. It would almost be worth a journey to stutgardt  [sic], to have a chat with such a genius” (“Fur” 535). For these viewers, the  works’ humorous appeal stems from an understanding of a rigid hier- archy that the animals are supposedly breaking. Potter’s works diverge  from Ploucquet’s: in his tableaux the overlaying of human behavior onto  animal bodies is no longer primarily “ludicrous”; rather it asserts a  profound similarity between the human and animal worlds. Where  Ploucquet’s animals are anthropomorphic in the allegorical, archetypal  manner of the fable (witness the cunning fox in fig. 3), Potter’s produce  the effect of having individualized, realistic identities. As Henning  remarks, “there is no need to assume . . . that Potter’s work is moral alle- gory or that it makes much use of animal symbolism” (669). Instead, the  subjectivities on display in his works invite a sentimental response based  on seeing them as almost human.  In conflating the inner lives of humans and animals, Potter’s  tableaux borrow from the anthropomorphic characterizations of  animals found in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century children’s books  such as sarah trimmer’s 1786 Fabulous Histories (which later became  known as The Story of the Robins), in which two children forge a relation- ship with a family of talking robins. As tess Coslett points out, the most  important function of such tales is the inculcation of ethical awareness  in their young readers, and anthropomorphism is an effective mode of  creating a sympathetic equivalence between human and animal  suffering. trimmer was ambivalent about deviating from the factual  and took pains to enclose the fictionality of the birds’ ability to speak  within a justificatory, explicitly moralizing frame. In the preface to  Fabulous Histories, she stresses that her tale of talking birds should not  be read “as containing the real conversations of birds . . . but as a series  of FABlEs intended to convey moral instruction . . . at the same time  that they excite compassion and tenderness for those interesting and  delightful creatures, on which such wanton cruelties are frequently  inflicted, and recommend universal benevolence” (trimmer vii).5  the spread and evolution of this “benevolence” continued  into the nineteenth century, mediated by other kinds of writing about  Autumn 2010 </page> <page sequence="10"> 16 COnOr CrEAnEy animals. teresa mangum notes that anthropomorphic representations  of dogs in the period portrayed them as exemplars of animals’ vulner- ability to human cruelty: “Animals, and particularly the dependent,  devoted dog, render victimization in a higher, purer idiom. the dog  serves as a voice of unmediated hence honest emotion; sensation, often  pain, informs its very language” (43). reading about animal victim- hood became morally formative: Ivan Kreilkamp, discussing the  increasing popularity of rsPCA reports from the 1840s on, observes  that “to be a literate middle-class Englishperson by mid-century was to  develop one’s sensibility and sympathy through the vicarious experi- ence of reading narratives of animal suffering” (92). Potter’s work sits  uneasily in this context, suspended between presenting a safe, domes- ticated space in which animals are forever free and unmolested, and  intimating by its inertness the impossibility of such a state. the domesticated idylls of his tableaux can also be read as  helping to assuage the anxieties about human brutishness that sprung  up in the wake of the developing post-Darwin consensus about  humans’ and animals’ shared lineage. they are perhaps the apothe- osis (or indeed the reductio ad absurdum) of the process of what James  turner calls “reclaiming the beast,” of divesting animals of the attri- butes that humans didn’t want their distant cousins to have. Potter’s  tableaux, in radically domesticating the wilder aspects of their animal  participants and placing them in human scenarios, give these animals,  in turner’s words, “a mind, and more importantly, a heart” (78). thus,  Potter’s pieces now suffer the fate of being judged by the standards  that he, in his small way, helped to pass on to us: our reimagining of  the nature of animal subjectivity makes his pieces read as oppressive  inscriptions of new fictional identities onto these bodies. His achieve- ment in rendering them undead has carried them into an era in which  their presence in an artwork draws that work into a moral debate  centered on the notion that a creature has a right both to its own iden- tity and to the natural passing into oblivion of that identity through  the process of decay. the still-present body of the preserved animal  becomes the scene of a coerced performativity in which its prior self  wrestles with its newly imposed one. these works are faithful to their  anthropomorphizing vision to an unnerving degree, but are also  haunted by these bodies’ prior autonomy. this hauntedness compli- cates any reading of them as solely kitsch—their discordant relations of  form and content generate ambiguities and ironies that make them   VICtOrIAn stuDIEs / VOlumE 53, nO. 1 </page> <page sequence="11"> PArAlytIC AnImAtIOn 17 richer and more interpretable than that designation would suggest. At  once tribute to nature and violation of it, these tableaux present their  subjects as endlessly flickering between body- and object-states, inhab- ited by ghostly pseudo-human subjectivities. “the Kittens’ Wedding” is, as I have intimated, perhaps the  most unnerving of Potter’s works. It takes as its object matter the cat,  which was, as ritvo puts it, in the nineteenth century “the most  frequently and energetically vilified domestic animal. . . . It did not  seem disposed to acknowledge human dominion” (Animal Estate 21). A  playful 1888 apologia for the domestic cat laments the fact that “cats  are but little understood, and their character is grossly belied” and  that “children in their infancy are taught to believe that cats are treach- erous, that they are thieves by nature and incapable of honesty”  (stables 813). Despite being a popular pet (or perhaps in part due to  the intimacy with humans that being a pet involved), the cat ran afoul  of an often moralistic anthropomorphism, in which a species’ confor- mity (or lack of it) to human standards of behavior determined its  place on the moral-typological ladder. species like cats that failed to  display the appropriate loyalty, deference, or material usefulness could  be written off as morally inferior. rural cats fared especially poorly:  their taste for game and chickens meant that they “frequently met the  fate of vermin, trapped, shot or poisoned” (ritvo, Platypus 193). An  indication of just how cheaply the life of a kitten was held mid–century  can be found at the end of The Old Curiosity Shop (1841), when Dickens’s  narrator describes the disgraced sampson Brass’s hackney-coach  journey to court: “the populace . . . saluted him with rotten eggs and  the carcasses of kittens” (549).  A 1950s guidebook to Potter’s museum informs us that these  particular carcasses were mostly supplied from Ward’s farm in nearby  Henfield, where the cats “were allowed to run wild in the barns,” but  bred in greater numbers than the farmer could sustain: “one kitten of  each family was usually retained, and the others were put to sleep. Walter  Potter was then allowed to choose any that were suitable for preserva- tion, and the remainder were buried” (Guide 2). Potter’s tableau stages a  utopian cat society whose members are capable of managing their own  population, and indeed of regulating their numbers in a manner that  would eliminate the surplus that made the piece possible. their presen- tation for display enables the viewer to experience the pleasure of  looking at seemingly healthy animal bodies without having to worry  Autumn 2010 </page> <page sequence="12"> 18 COnOr CrEAnEy about the costs involved in keeping these (not quite) malthusian hungry  bodies alive; at the same time, their asphyxiated restriction in an airless  box reproduces the manner in which they died.  the tableau bolsters its claims to represent the human world  through the accretion of material detail: the brocaded fabric, the  jewels, the lace veil, the bowties, the priestly robes, the pocket-hand- kerchiefs, the polished church furniture. these objects emulate the  signifying excesses of a human marriage ceremony and ground the  piece’s fictional world in a material one of objects familiar to the  human viewer. As Henning has noted (670), Potter’s aesthetic conforms  to that of the miniature, as described by susan stewart—an aesthetic  of silent, spatial atemporality:  the miniature always tends toward tableau rather than toward narrative, toward  silence and spatial boundaries rather than toward expository closure. . . . the  observer is offered a transcendent and simultaneous view of the miniature, yet is  trapped outside the possibility of a lived reality of the miniature. Hence the  nostalgic desire to present the lower classes, peasant life, or the cultural other  within a timeless and uncontaminatable miniature form. the miniature is against  speech, particularly as speech reveals an inner dialectical, or dialogic, nature. the  miniature’s fixed form is manipulated by individual fantasy rather than by phys- ical circumstance. (stewart 66) this model usefully describes some of the ways in which Potter’s  tableau functions: its formal qualities (taxidermic frozenness, minia- ture detail, glass encasement) enable it to conjure a fantastical,  nostalgic world that at once evokes and renders strange the rituals of  English village life by projecting them in miniature onto these domes- ticated animals. they are “manipulated by individual fantasy”: the  viewer is invited to experience the scene as being a creation of Potter’s  imagination, but, at the same time, the authenticating bodies and  details assert its autonomous existence. By framing the scene in a glass  case, Potter presents these kittens as safely inhabiting their own delim- ited, sovereign space and yet perpetually available for our visual and  affective consumption. the case renders in miniature michael Watts’s  description of “the relationship between animals and modernity” as “a  giant act of enclosure—necessitating, of course, loss and displacement”  (293). the tableau performs a strikingly literal enactment of this rela- tionship. Anthropomorphizing the animals helps to obscure their  “loss and displacement”: the tableau opens up enough space between   VICtOrIAn stuDIEs / VOlumE 53, nO. 1 </page> <page sequence="13"> PArAlytIC AnImAtIOn 19 these bodies and the natural world to foreclose any silent reproach  they might direct at us for our neglect.  stewart notes the miniature’s capacity to generate in viewers a  sense that they are witnessing a significant frozen moment: “the  miniature offers a world clearly limited in space but frozen and thereby  both particularized and generalized in time” (48). these spatial and  temporal delineations work to create the impression of an intensely  significant, pregnant moment for the bride and groom, and one of  reverential, silent observation for the guests—onlookers and witnesses  to a very human ritual of social reproduction. the medium and the  narrative are well-suited here: the frozen poses of the kittens are  natural to the extent that the piece depicts a moment in which most of  the participants would, in the real world, also be standing still. the  stillness here might be read as not that of death, but rather as the still- ness of an elongated, and particularly meaningful moment in a pair of  lives. In the Descriptive Souvenir’s account, the “man” in the last row but  one is looking on in frozen frustration and disappointment, while the  bride’s eyes are “dewey” with happiness (Garratt 7). Potter carefully  directs the kittens’ eyes, the only visibly synthetic parts of their bodies,  to generate these narrative effects, and these gazes are perhaps the site  of the piece’s most violent appropriation. In re-orienting them, the  tableau places them “in character.” this is what makes them humorous,  but it’s also what also makes them horrifying: if we go along with the  tableau’s suggestion that these bodies contain subjectivities, and that  this is a moment in a continuing narrative, we realize that they are  being forced to look at each other, and to act out their maker’s anthro- pocentric marriage fantasy. the tableau’s particular material qualities  here generate an awful irony: as well as being actually, physically here,  the kittens are here in perpetuity. Bride and groom are helplessly bound  to stand and gaze upon each other for eternity, with no prospect of  aging or decaying. the phrase that Dickens’s narrator uses in Our Mutual Friend  to describe the preserved animals in mr. Venus’s shop window captures  their predicament: they are “paralytically animated” (91). We might  read these kittens’ forever-locked gazes as a grim parody of the strait- ening contract of monogamous human marriage, portraying a tedious  eternity stretching out ahead of our young lovers, or perhaps as a wry  literalization of the manner in which the realist novel’s tale tends to  expire at the moment of marriage, leaving the characters forever  Autumn 2010 </page> <page sequence="14"> 20 COnOr CrEAnEy Fig. 4.

But we might also read  them as a fantasy of what happens when the most abject bodies in The  Old Curiosity Shop (“the carcasses of kittens”) get a space to themselves.  Potter retrieves something from Dickens’s gutter—rather than occu- pying the lowest rung on the ontological ladder, the dross thrown at  the pilloried criminal, these dead kittens are here celebrated, in  however eccentric and troubling a fashion.  Potter finds an obvious if imprecise analogue in Our Mutual  Friend’s taxidermist, mr. Venus, whose “little dark greasy shop” (83) is  filled with uncanny and grotesque bodies, which he articulates and  animates with watery-eyed, myopic craftsmanship and tenderness.  Dickens had been taken by his illustrator marcus stone in the spring of  1863 to a similar establishment, that of “a certain Willis who lived in   VICtOrIAn stuDIEs / VOlumE 53, nO. 1 </page> <page sequence="15"> PArAlytIC AnImAtIOn 21 seven Dials, who was an articulator of skeletons, a stuffer of birds, and  dealer in bottled monsters” (Cotsell 65). the proprietor was not in,  and instead they encountered “a despondent melancholy youth” upon  whom Dickens based the character of Venus.6 Potter and Venus differ  in many ways—Potter a rural amateur, Venus an urban professional— but both employ an explicitly fictionalizing version of the taxidermic  capacity to animate the dead. Venus stresses his own creativity: as he  tells silas Wegg, if he were brought to him as a bag of bones, he would  “sort [his] wertebrae [sic], in a manner that would equally surprise and  charm [him]” (88). Venus here lays claim to both an imitative genius  and a creative spark that goes beyond imitation, and prides himself on  his ability to perform what we have seen in Potter’s work: he repro- duces nature realistically while also transforming it in a fashion that is,  for want of a better word, expressive. Albert Hutter draws the inevi- table conclusion about the taxidermist’s relationship to his author:  “Venus’s full occupation is the artful reconstitution of the human  frame and the lifelike resurrection of all forms of animal life. He is  more than a taxidermist and less than a god; but as a parody of a  godlike creator, he fulfils within the novel the function of the artist, of  the novelist himself” (Hutter 152). to the extent this is true the narra- tive is signaling its own incapacity or unwillingness to do more than  recycle and reanimate bodies and narratives. Carey’s characterization  of Dickens’s imagination captures the macabre side of this process,  describing it as “haunting the frontier between the living and the inan- imate, preying on effigies, corpses, artificial limbs, repelled by the  female, inventing people who fall away into dead pieces, and buildings  or furniture that seem to gather strength and come alive” (174). the objects in Venus’s shop, in their ambiguous state of frozen  animation, haunt this frontier most explicitly, but many other bodies  in the text are consigned to it too, often against their will. the charac- ters in Our Mutual Friend who actually manage to return to the dust  must go to some trouble to do so: Harmon the elder, says mortimer,  “directs himself to be buried with certain eccentric ceremonies and  precautions against coming to life” (26), and Betty Higden must walk  upriver (and out of the plot) to die, away from “paralysis and pauperism”  (384), finally succumbing only after being overcome by, and emerging  from, repeated bouts of swooning “deadness” (376, 500). Others, such  as rogue riderhood, are denied the release of actual death: tempo- rarily deceased, he is “instinctively unwilling to be restored to the  Autumn 2010 </page> <page sequence="16"> 22 COnOr CrEAnEy consciousness of this existence, and would be left dormant, if he could”  (440). Death is often rehearsed or provisional in the novel: for the  younger Harmon, a feigned demise allows him to escape the oppres- sive burden of inherited wealth; for Jenny Wren, playing dead means a  respite from the conditions of a painful life—she asks riah to “come  up and be dead” (280). to borrow Adrian Poole’s description, in Our  Mutual Friend “most of the life . . . tends to a state of suspended anima- tion. nothing seems certainly dead nor entirely alive” (Poole ix). Cath- erine Gallagher suggestively explores Dickens’s “incessant play of the  imagination across the life-death divide” (“novel” 188), reading Great  Expectations (1861) as an invitation to “play with the difference between  animate and inanimate beings” and to “pretend that bodies can be  held at the brink of life or moved gradually in and out of a vital state  through the operations of the mind” (188). she contends that the line  between the living and the dead in the nineteenth century was  “remarkably controversial” and “haunted not only by epistemological  doubt, but also by ontological uncertainty,” a result of the fact that  materialism “dramatically expanded the zones of the organic, vastly  multiplied the entities that could be described as living or dead” (189).  the ontological uncertainty that this opens up finds its way into Dick- ens’s novels, but not as a set of assertions about the ontological status of  the bodies they narrate (although Gallagher does reproduce Dickens’s  claim that “I don’t invent it—really I do not—but see it, and write it  down” [202]). Instead, the novel uses the “rhetoric of uncertainty” of  the “various discourses that were redrawing the life-death bound- aries . . . to enhance its own range of suspended possibilities” (196).  Our Mutual Friend also expands its “range of suspended possi- bilities” through a rhetoric of uncertainty that renders provisional and  hypothetical almost every descriptive moment in the novel. the phrase  “as if” appears 392 times in the text, in each case acting to disavow a  precise grasp on the narrator’s part of the thing narrated. When we  include the phrase’s cognates, such as “seemed” and “appeared,” we  see these markers of provisionality being inserted on almost every  page of the novel. Again and again, the narrator brackets his claims to  declarative certainty, and takes pains explicitly to maintain this distinc- tion between the figurative and the (seemingly inaccessible) literal.  When Eugene Wrayburn spars with the perspiring Headstone in his  office, for instance, the narrator dryly describes him looking “as if he  found him beginning to be rather an entertaining study” (290). this is   VICtOrIAn stuDIEs / VOlumE 53, nO. 1 </page> <page sequence="17"> PArAlytIC AnImAtIOn 23 one of many moments where the narrator gently admits of an uncer- tainty about his characters’ inner life. “As if” is elsewhere used to insert  a dispassionate distance between the narration and its more poetic  flights, even as its images coruscate. One example: a train passes thun- derously by, and then is gone, “as if it had exploded in the rush of  smoke and steam and glare” (731). Cumulatively, such moments estab- lish the novel as a space in which imaginative interpretations of the  world can proliferate, but only at the cost of the narrator’s epistemo- logical authority. Audrey Jaffe sees in the novel this “absence of a  prominent omniscient voice and a clear omniscient perspective” (142).  she notes that “knowledge thus only exists by invention, so that no  character and no narrator can ever be certain of possessing it in its  entirety” (157), and that the “easily identifiable omniscient voice may  have disappeared, but concern with omniscience has not” (158). the  narrator is engaging in a version of what George levine calls the “epis- temological strategy of self-annihilation” (Dying 153), using these  repeated “as if”s to efface its own agency and sidestep the reader’s  demand for positive truth claims. this tactic stems from Dickens’s  familiarly modern apprehension about the text’s inability to locate  value in a corrupted world, and we might see him as making a virtue of  that limitation by using the relative indecipherability of social identi- ties and the difficulty of locating moral goodness as a springboard for  the novel’s proliferative, image-laden narrative form.  In the light of these concerns, mr. Venus’s shop becomes a  place where brute inscription and animation are playfully problema- tized. Venus’s inscriptions of new life and meaning on the bodies and  body parts on which he works make his creatures into mildly gothic  versions of the kinds of discomfiting palimpsests created by Potter.  the most suggestive moment in the text, for our purposes, is its use of  Cock robin (like John Harmon, a protagonist whose death facilitates  his tale), who appears as both the subject of Potter’s first tableau and  an “as if” work-in-progress on Venus’s workbench. When silas Wegg  first visits the taxidermist’s shop in the hopes of retrieving his ampu- tated leg, he looks around, and figures begin to resolve themselves  from the gloom: Wegg perceives a pretty little dead bird lying on the counter, with its head drooping  on one side against the rim of mr. Venus’s saucer, and a long stiff wire piercing the  breast. As if it were Cock robin, the hero of the ballad, and mr. Venus were the  sparrow with his bow and arrow, and mr. Wegg were the fly with his little eye. Autumn 2010 </page> <page sequence="18"> 24 COnOr CrEAnEy  mr. Venus dives, and produces another muffin, yet untoasted; taking the  arrow out of the breast of Cock robin, he proceeds to toast it on the end of that  cruel instrument. (84) As michael Cotsell points out, the punctured breast of Venus’s dead  robin was an unusual feature, and would have disqualified it from  acting as a conventional taxidermic specimen: “the specimen would be  spoiled if the breast was pierced: an incision was usually made under  the wing on the side most damaged” (67). Venus’s robin then lacked  the capacity to pass, in that key initial moment in the reception of the  taxidermic artifact, as alive. It would, however, have fit perfectly into a  display like Potter’s richest and strangest piece, “the Original Death  and Burial of Cock robin.”7 the tableau contains the preserved bodies of ninety-eight birds  (and a modeled “Bull” made from fur stretched over a wooden frame),  arrayed in a large glass case, just over six feet wide and five feet tall. It  presents Cock robin’s funeral cortege and its onlookers, with many of  the birds wearing black sashes.8 some have artificial tears in their eyes,  made from glass beads. It was Potter’s first tableau, begun in 1854 and  completed seven years later. It contains specimens of all the birds  mentioned in the rhyme. the Descriptive Souvenir describes its genesis: [Potter] was always very keen on ornithology, that is the study of birds, and had  stuffed so many of them that his family dreaded seeing any more specimens. . . . then  his sister, Jane, showed him a book of nursery rhymes, remarking that perhaps he  might like to execute some of them in animals and birds. In a flash he realized what  to do with his specimens and Cock robin was born. (Garratt 26) Potter in fact borrowed not only the narrative but also the attitudes of  the birds from Jane’s book. Harrison Weir’s illustrations from an 1850  edition of the tale appear to have been the source of the Owl’s and the  rook’s poses and props.9 the nursery rhyme “Who Killed Cock robin?” had existed in  chapbook form since at least 1795, and scores of versions were printed  in the period. It was one of the most popular of all children’s titles in  the nineteenth century, perhaps, as Peter Hunt suggests, due to “a  continuing need to introduce the concept of death early to children”  (74). the rhyme begins: “Who killed Cock robin?” / I, said the  sparrow, / With my bow and arrow, / I killed Cock robin / Who saw  him die? / I, said the Fly / With my little eye, I saw him die” and   VICtOrIAn stuDIEs / VOlumE 53, nO. 1 </page> <page sequence="19"> PArAlytIC AnImAtIOn 25 Fig. 5.

Popular myth had it that the robin covered  the bodies of the unburied dead with mosses and leaves (Fletcher 103).  Potter’s second tableau represents them doing just that for the epony- mous Babes in the Wood, whose rhyme tells us that the children received  no burial “till robin redbreast, piously, / Did cover them with leaves”  (Opie 145). robert Herrick’s self-penned epitaph, entitled “tO rOBIn  rEDBrEAst” apostrophizes the bird and asks: “let thy last kindnesse be  / With leaves and mosse-work for to cover me” (Fletcher 110).  the rhyme plays obliquely on these popular understandings of  the robin, continuing the association between the robin and burial as  the other birds feel compelled to band together to perform the service  that Cock robin had performed for others when he was alive. the solem- Autumn 2010 </page> <page sequence="20"> 26 COnOr CrEAnEy Fig. 6-8.

Does he, or do any of the other birds, regret it? the sparrow’s  statement is matter-of-fact, and formally of a type with the other birds’  statements. A Household Words piece on the “cruel and unprincipled  things sung or said to young children in so many of our popular nursery  rhymes and tales” ponders the troubling ambiguity of the sparrow’s  statement: “the outspoken, barefaced, valiant impudence of the answer,  which is far more like a boast than a confession, finds but too much  sympathy with the hearers” (Horne 602). It goes on to observe that there  is “not a word of the sparrow being put upon his trial for the crime; no  justice is done, no punishment is awarded” (602). In Potter’s version of the rhyme, these questions of death,  commemoration, and—especially—culpability are inescapable. It is  haunted by its murderously literal relationship to its source material.  Ostensibly, the tableau makes manifest the objective of the rhyme: it  pays tribute to robin and shows ninety-seven tearful birds solemnly  taking over his role of giving the dead a dignified burial. (their display  of virtue echoes the one that John Harmon’s apparent death facilitates  in Our Mutual Friend: “Dead, I have found the true friends of my life- time still as true, as tender, and as faithful as when I was alive, and  making my memory an incentive to good actions done in my name”  [367].) Of course, the great irony of Potter’s version of “the Original   VICtOrIAn stuDIEs / VOlumE 53, nO. 1 </page> <page sequence="21"> PArAlytIC AnImAtIOn 27 Fig. 9.

Death and Burial of Cock robin” is that neither Cock robin nor any of  the other birds receive a burial; their dead bodies are instead preserved  for display. the materials (unburied animal bodies) that make up the  piece militate against the moral lesson of the rhyme (the necessity of  giving this animal its due burial). It is a curious rendering of a text  about mourning, in that Cock robin’s mourners don’t get the chance  to commemorate him and move on with their lives. Instead, Potter  presents them as paralyzed at the moment of burial, doomed never to  get over their loss. Indeed, we might say that they aren’t even allowed  to experience an authentic loss—robin is still here in front of them.  the birds are trapped within a work that denies natural temporality at  the same time that it advocates the temporal work of mourning. the  tableau becomes a frozen drama of coercion and captivity, one whose  technical accomplishment reflects darkly on its maker: the more realis- tically alive the birds look, the more disturbing is the predicament in  which he has placed them.

We might read the piece as an act of absolute literal-minded- ness and resistance to figuration: by replacing the words of the rhyme  with their real-world referents, Potter literalizes the text of the allegory  of Cock robin. the rhyme’s figurative and allegorical nuances are  swept aside in Potter’s version, which employs the most material of  signifiers in its painstaking and brutally literal rendering of the  rhyme’s text. His birds become the site of a simultaneous feat and  failure of imagination. they are at once the coerced protagonists and  strikingly non-absent referents of the tableau, offering an object lesson  in the darker side of ekphrasis.

J. t. mitchell remarks,  always has at its heart a desire to materialize the image, to bring it to   VICtOrIAn stuDIEs / VOlumE 53, nO. 1 </page> <page sequence="23"> PArAlytIC AnImAtIOn 29 Fig. 11.

Ascot: mPm, 2008. used by permission of Pat morris. the level of active presence—and as such, it bears a close relation to the  mourner’s desire for the return of the dead. He coins the phrase  “ekphrastic hope” to describe the desire for writing to “bring person,  place, picture, etc. before the mind’s eye” (153). Potter’s work displays  this ekphrastic urge in abundance, so much so in fact that it invokes  what mitchell calls “ekphrastic fear.” this is “the moment of resistance  or counterdesire that occurs when we sense that the difference between  the verbal and the visual representation might collapse, and the figura- tive, imaginary desire of ekphrasis might be realized literally and actu- ally” (112). this literalizing catastrophe is the inevitable conclusion of  the ekphrastic urge pursued to its logical end, but one that mitchell  presents as only abstractly apprehendable. Potter comes perhaps as  close as anyone could to performing it in reality. the inevitable precon- Autumn 2010 </page> <page sequence="24"> 30 COnOr CrEAnEy dition of this performance is the death of the bodies employed in its  making, but what’s fascinating about this piece is that this is already  thematized: the tableau’s chosen narrative, with its preoccupations  with killing, culpability, and atonement, fits remarkably well with the  implications of its particular form.  “the Original Death and Burial of Cock robin” is explicit  about its anthropomorphizing work: while the birds before us are  physical birds, they are also adopting human social identities. “Who’ll  be the parson?,” “Who’ll be the clerk?,” asks the rhyme, and the birds  one by one volunteer to play their human roles. the contemporary  viewer is confronted by the unsettling combination of the birds’ mate- rial bodies and their implied subjectivities in a fictional performance.  the verisimilitude that Potter confers on them is again what makes  them compelling—it is only because they still look like live birds that  we (modern-day viewers) invest them with a set of rights that the  tableau fails to grant them. the birds are animated in a different  manner than the kittens: their lifelike reconstruction and posing also  makes them seem alive, but here, in a moment of harmony between  the narrative and the means used to represent it, we see the birds as  capable of feeling and movement, yet immobilized. their inertness is  that of both the corpse and the transfixed witness. the tearful birds in  Potter’s trees model the appropriate response to the viewers, and might  also be said to represent them, silently watching and reading, fixated. so “the Original Death and Burial of Cock robin” is at once a  work of formal innovation (using animals as signifiers of something other  than themselves) and an intensely literal-minded one (replacing words  and images with their real-world referents). the result is darkly ironic.  As  we have seen, the content of the tale turns against the mode of its telling,  as Potter himself gets implicated in the arrested interment of Cock robin  and the ninety-seven other dead birds in the case. His rendering of the  rhyme narrative simultaneously enacts both the birds’ eternally prolonged  killing and their indefinitely deferred mourning, and he falls, however  inadvertently, under the penumbra of guilt and culpability that surrounds  the actions of the birds in the tale. Potter’s “witchery of pose and outline”  inscribes on these bodies a compellingly literary conundrum, that of a  storyteller who has trapped his characters in his tale.  the forcefulness of Potter’s naively literal relationship to his  text gives us a clearer sense of the uncanny power that mr. Venus exer- cises. In both the novel and the tableau, the dead body stands as a   VICtOrIAn stuDIEs / VOlumE 53, nO. 1 </page> <page sequence="25"> PArAlytIC AnImAtIOn 31 Fig. 12.

Venus, in  his dual roles of the recuperative taxidermist and the opaquely  murderous “sparrow with his bow and arrow” (84), acts as the char- acter through which the novel enacts in not-entirely-comic miniature  its ambivalence about its work of animating its bodies and moving  them in and out of circulation. Potter, by fabricating a suspended after- life for his bodies that places them in a kind of materialized posterity,  helps us to see what’s at stake in the novel’s recourse to the uncanny  figure of the taxidermist as a model for its own work, and why it rele- gates its literalizations of the figurative to the realm of the “as if.” New York University NOTES With special thanks to Pat morris for his kind permission to use reproductions of color  images from his Walter Potter and his Museum of Curious Taxidermy.

And that encounter with their otherness makes them more, not  less, important to me, more liberating, more real” (Realism 246). In Victorian representa- tions of animals, he notes, “one looks hard to find encounters with animals that register  the integrity of the animal itself” (250). 3she goes on to argue that “there is, among those of us who study Victorian  culture, an embarrassment, or the threat of an embarrassment, about its objects: Do we  like them? Do we think any of them are beautiful? the uncertain relationship, for many  of us, between ourselves and the objects we study—or the objects in the texts we study — makes it safe simply to lump them all together as commodities” (159). 4Potter is rarely mentioned in the periodical press. An 1884 article in the Nine- teenth Century refers to him but does not name him, describing only “a naturalist of  humble origin” in Bramber, and recommending his “admirable collection” (Hewlett  337). 5For more on this topic, see Harriet ritvo’s discussion of the development of the  animal rights movement (Animal 125–66), which outlines the growth of human aware- ness of animal suffering in the nineteenth century and how it affects our evolving self- understanding as custodians of the welfare of animals. 6Dickens owned anthropomorphic specimens himself: “on Dickens’s writing- desk there was a French bronze group representing a duel with swords, fought by a couple  of very fat toads, one of them . . . in the act of making a prodigious lunge forward, which  the other receives in the very middle of his digestive apparatus” (Forster 3.186n), which  bear a strong resemblance to the “two preserved frogs fighting a small-sword duel” (Our  Mutual Friend 83) in Venus’s window. Dickens himself had the experience of being  presented to the world behind glass. Both John Carey (104) and michael slater use the  word “exhibit” to describe the public display during his much-discussed childhood expe- rience of working at Warren’s blacking factory: due to “the remarkable speed and skill”  (slater 24) with which he and his coworker, Bob Fagin, applied the stickers to the bottles  of blacking, the management put them on “public exhibition” (24) in a window, where “a  crowd would often gather to watch them” (Carey 104). Dickens later was to write an adver- tizing jingle for Warren’s in 1832, which featured a mourning dove (a detail that reso- nates suggestively with the next tableau under discussion) who mistook her reflection in  a shiny blacked boot for her true love (Bodenheimer 69). 7While it is unlikely that Dickens saw Potter’s actual tableau, morris points out  that there were a number of copycat versions in circulation in the 1860s—the “Original”  in the title was added after a dispute with Brighton taxidermist William swaysland, who  claimed in 1869 that he had thought of the idea first (morris, Walter Potter 46), so it is not  far-fetched to suggest that he may have been aware of its existence. 8Our Mutual Friend features its own bird funeral: Jenny Wren—whose name  derives from Cock robin’s lover in popular folklore (lockwood 237) —tells lizzie that   VICtOrIAn stuDIEs / VOlumE 53, nO. 1 </page> <page sequence="27"> PArAlytIC AnImAtIOn 33 she has “ just finished a large mourning order the day before yesterday.
