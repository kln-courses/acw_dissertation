University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1996. x+246 pp. $40.00 (cloth). The Living God is a study of how Schleiermacher understood and appropriated Spinoza, particularly with regard to the doctrine of God (p. 4). It traces Friedrich Schleiermacher's theology from two early essays on Benedict Spinoza (1793-94) through his Speeches on Religion (1799) to his mature Christian dogmatics in The Christian Faith (1830-31). Julia Lamm's introduction, method, argument, and doc- umentation are deliberate, patient, thorough, and as lucid as can be imagined. Her conclusions are likewise clear and persuasive: Schleiermacher "departs from Spinoza in his [Schleiermacher's] claim that only love expresses the essence of God and ... his identification of redemption through Christ with the goal of the eternal divine decree. He maintains his affinities with Spinoza through his refusal to assign personality to God, his suspicion of anthropomorphism, and his emphasis on the whole" (p. 218). Schleiermacher's age presented him with two theological alternatives: either a pietistic devotion to God as an anthropomorphic personality, or a Spinozistic dei- fying of impersonal nature; either God as personal and transcendent, or God as nonpersonal and immanent. With impressive discernment, Lamm shows how Schleiermacher refused these alternatives and formulated a third, namely, God as "living." As her title indicates, Lamm's intention is to explore Schleiermacher's concept of the living God. Yet her study expresses not only historical mastery but also theological devotion. Thus her inquiry into historical theology has relevance for constructive theology in our own day.

Lamm is particularly striking in presenting Schleiermacher's steady refusal of anthropomorphic images for God. She writes that he found such images both "naive and irreverent" (p. 214). For Schleiermacher, religious piety arises from our sense of the sheer givenness of the world (p. 114), our correlative sense of sheer receptivity in relation to this givenness (p. 183), and our sense and taste for the infinite as qualitatively distinct from our human finitude (p. 116). Under- stood in this way, "piety ... requires that we be willing to let go of certain concepts of God" (p. 98). Thus Schleiermacher formulated theological revisions "more in- telligible and reverent" (pp. 128, 200) and at the same time truer to many of the finest insights of theological tradition. As Schleiermacher pioneered in post-Kantian Christian theology, so he led "a shift to a modern theological anthropology" (p. 173), developing a vision of hu- man freedom firmly rooted in the contexts of our lives. In Lamm's felicitous phrasing, "all existence is coexistence" (p. 188). Our freedom is "never a freedom- from, rather always freedom-in-relation-to" (p. 175). Ethical life is "the attempt to describe, understand and order systems of relations and causes without pre- tending to extricate oneself from them" (p. 43). The phrase that comprehends Schleiermacher's worldview, appearing like a leitmotiv throughout Lamm's study, is the Spinozistic phrase "One and All." For Schleiermacher, however, "One and All" does not denote pantheism. Rather, the phrase invokes our world as a whole that "while greater than the sum of its parts, depends on the harmony of all parts and the excellence of each" (p. 74). "One and All" describes "unity in plurality" (p. 106), a God-given community of reci- procity "that allows for genuine individuality, novelty, beauty, and goodness" (p. 9). In his Speeches of 1799 Schleiermacher describes this world whole as an "eternal work of art" (p. 79). In The Christian Faith of 1830-31 he calls it a "divine work of art" (p. 222). Thus Lamm calls Schleiermacher's view an "aesthetic monism." Our world is "a whole, as opposed to an aggregate," where all is "inherency, complex- ity, interdependence, relationality, plurality, movement" (pp. 226-27). Within this worldview, Schleiermacher's mature theology reformulates the tra- ditional attributes of God: eternity, omnipresence, omnipotence, omniscience (p. 144). Likewise, the traditional doctrines of human regeneration and sanctifica- tion, which Lamm explicates through careful comparisons with Martin Luther and John Calvin (pp. 201-12). Finally Schleiermacher comes to the culminating attributes of God's wisdom and God's love. Yet, as Lamm observes, this theological "climax is really the starting point" (p. 200). For in the end Schleiermacher does not derive his Christian theology from his worldview. Rather, his worldview is born from his Christian experience of redemption in relation to Christ, revealer of God's wisdom and love. In Schleiermacher's theology, merely speculative doc- trines concerning the "essence of God would mean nothing apart from the expe- rience of redemption" (p. 217). Lamm acquaints us anew with the creativity and profundity of Schleiermach- er's theology. Reading a secondary work can never substitute for studying a pri- mary source. But reading Lamm with due attention will carry readers to the heart of Schleiermacher's theology and to vital theological concerns for our own age as well. ALBERT L.
