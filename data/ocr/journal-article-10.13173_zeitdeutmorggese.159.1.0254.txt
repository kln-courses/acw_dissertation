Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag 2006. 358 pp.  (Ethno­Indology 4.) ISBN 978­3­447­05187­3. € 48,–. Banaras, the subject of this volume, is no ordinary city – it is both extraordinarily holy  and very old. As one of the world’s holiest cities, it finds itself in the distinguished com­ pany of Jerusalem and Mecca, and like Jerusalem, Athens, and Beijing, Banaras is one  of the oldest living cities in the world. Like other holy cities, it is an important site of  pilgrimage but it is also the final destination for those who come to die here so as to be  released from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. For its residents, it is not just a desti­ nation but a dynamic collection of fluid spaces where they live, work, and die – the city of  their everyday life. Each of the fourteen essays in this volume tackle some facet of the multiple ways in  which the space of the city of Banaras has been visualized, imagined and culturally repre­ sented by diverse actors and groups. The essays are wide­ranging in the methods they use  and time period. While the focus is on the representation of space in visual media – such  as maps, panoramas, and photography, the space of the city is also revealed to us through  other methods – in literature and through the mapping of everyday and ceremonial prac­ tices as in processions. While Culture and Power in Banaras: Community, Performance,  and Environment, 1800–1980, the well­received volume on Banaras edited by Sandria B.  Freitag, 1 focused on varied aspects of the city’s popular culture, the overarching theme  of this volume is space. Space has been a central concern of architectural and urban historians and theorists,  and geographers but has received little focused attention in South Asian studies. Readers  expecting to find the theorization of space or the use of spatial theories will, for the most  part, not find it in this volume. At the same time, the focus and attention on space is a  necessary correction to its general neglect. The authors in this volume map the sacred and  community geographies of the city, show how the spaces of the city have been represented  in visual media, reveal the contestation over space, and show how spatial practices help to  mould individual subjectivities. This volume is a welcome addition to the growing litera­ ture on South Asian cities and on Banaras, in particular, a city which has delighted pho­ tographers and scholars alike. While Diana L. Eck’s celebrated study (1982) 2 examined  the sacred history and geography of Banaras, other scholars have taken up such varied  subjects as the city’s architecture (Michell/Singh 2005) 3, death in the city (Parry 1994) 4,  the organization of leisure time by the city’s artisans (Kumar 1988) 5, education (Kumar  2000) 6 or the study of a famous writer from the city (Dalmia 1997) 7. The examination of  space adds a new dimension to studies of Banaras. 1 S. Freitag (ed.): Culture and Power in Banaras: Community, Performance, and En- vironment, 1800–1980. Berkeley 1989. 2 D. L.

Contributions in this section highlight depictions of the city in classical texts and  then, attempt to map the text’s sacred geography onto the city or examine the movement  in space of ritual actors in processions. In other words, the papers in this section explore  the relationship between theory (textual evidence) and practice. Hans Bakker explores  the role of Avimukta or Avimukteśvara, one of the oldest sanctuaries in the city, in the  expansion of the holy field of Avimuktakṣetra between the Gupta period and what he  refers to as the “ ‘Muslim’ ” period. Bakker reveals the visualization of Avimukteśvara in  texts even as he highlights the role played by the Pāśupata order from approximately the  Gupta period onwards in the growth of the holy field of Avimukta. The laymen kept the  Śmaśāna Ghāṭ, Maṇikarṇikā to their left while circumambulating Avimukteśvara even  as the cremation ground became the haunt of the Pāśupata renouncer thereby enhancing  the holiness of Banaras. These varied practices reveal the tension between popular and  heterodox practices. The next two chapters explore the goddesses in the city. According to sacred texts there  were 324 goddesses in the city, however, only 96 are currently seen in the city. Ravi S.  Singh and Rana P. B. Singh map out the spatial patterns and locations of various groups  of goddesses in the city. Annette Wilke’s contribution looks at the nine festival days of  goddess Durgā to show how the Nine Durgās, which are pan­Hindu, are localized in the  landscape of Banaras as each of the nine manifestations of the goddess are identified with  a Goddess of Kāśī. Wilke makes the argument that the diverse goddess shrines have been  selected as the Nine Durgās because of their location in space, which allows them to forge  a triangular pilgrimage route in place of an earlier circular one. Sunthar Visuvalingam and Elizabeth Chalier­Visuvalingam remind us that  Banaras is not simply the sacred city of Hindus but had a Buddhist past and a Muslim  presence after its conquest by Muslims. Syncretic practices emerged as in the celebration  of the marriage of Lāṭ Bhairõ to the adjacent well, which had Hindu as well as Muslim  participants. However, soon after the imposition of colonial rule, Hindu­Muslim violence  erupted in 1809 at this contested site. Yet some years later, Hindu­Muslim unity helped to  bring about the repeal of the British­imposed house tax. Focusing on the example of Lāṭ  Bhairõ as an example of syncretic practices and communal conflict, Visuvalingam and  Chalier­Visuvalingam examine what they call the “economy of violence,” the means by  which violence is contained and redirected by Hindu and Muslim religious frameworks.  The chapters in this section show a deep familiarity with classical texts, attention to detail,  and painstaking documentation that is a useful contribution to scholarship. At the same  time, in many cases the dense detail and description overwhelms the argument or under­ lying theme of the essay. The second part of this volume looks at maps. How can religious ideas be shown on  maps? What kind of visual form is apposite for the representation of omnipresence? Axel  Michaels takes up these important questions in his essay. Michaels examines two dif­ ferent maps of Banaras published in the 1870s in order to answer these questions. Moving  from the visualization of religious ideas on maps to the use of maps in religious contro­ versies on the ground, Jörg Gengnagel examines early lithographical maps of Banaras,  including the maps examined by Michaels, in order to study the outcome of a public  controversy in the second half of the nineteenth century regarding the correct route for  the performance of the Pañcakrośīyātrā, the circumambulatory route around Kāśī, one  of the boundary limits of Banaras. The nineteenth century reformers argued that un­ der Muslim rule the Pañcakrośī procession had been abandoned or elapsed. According  to the reformers, by the time the Pañcakrośī procession had been reestablished, people  </page> <page sequence="3"> 256 Bücherbesprechungen had  forgotten the correct path. It was through a combination of scriptural authority and  modern techniques of surveying and measuring that the reformers established the cor­ rect route. Gengnagel’s fieldwork reveals however that the reformers were unsuccessful  in persuading the pilgrims to adopt the “correct” route showing that it is people and not  maps that create sacred space. While this volume discusses many different temples, Sumathi Ramaswamy’s chapter  looks at a rather unusual shrine established in Banaras in 1936 called “Bharat Mata Man­ dir” or “Mother India Temple.” Unlike other shrines that contain images of gods and god­ desses, this new shrine had as its focus of worship a relief map of India made of marble. As  Ramaswamy reminds us, Mother India had long assumed an anthropomorphic form as in  Abanindranath Tagore’s famous image from around 1905. However, for various reasons,  India’s nationalists wanted to create a more “secular” space for nationalist worship by all  Indians and the absence of an anthropomorphic image in the temple is notable. However,  despite its mention in popular pilgrimage maps and guide­books, the temple attracts few  patrons leading Ramaswamy to conclude that even though the map of India is important  it also fails to evoke the requisite visual devotion for the land it iconically represents. The  chapters in this section raise important questions about the ability of maps to represent re­ ligious ideas and the infinite, the authority of maps sanctioned by sacred texts and modern  cartographic methods versus longstanding popular practices in the production of sacred  space, and the ability of the map of India to function as a suitable icon in a temple. Moving from an emphasis on maps, the contributions in the third section concentrate  on images of the city. Banaras has been depicted in painted panoramas in the colonial  period, in panorama­photography that developed subsequently and in contemporary  panoramic images in pilgrimage maps. Niels Gutschow painstakingly documents the  panoramas of Banaras from the earliest view by the missionary Joseph Tieffenthaler.  Gutschow shows us that in the nineteenth century, panoramic views of the city influ­ enced the pictorial conventions adopted by Indian artists and map­makers. Joachim K.  Bautze considers published views of Banaras from the late eighteenth century to 1911  especially highlighting the large volume of photographic views of the city. Bautze re­ veals that many of the photographs of Banaras showed the imprint of earlier engraved  and lithographed views of the city. At the same time he carefully highlights for example,  the fact that there is considerable ambiguity about the source for the illustrations in most  illustrated books published between 1860 and 1900 that were illustrated with woodcuts  or steel­engravings from original albumen photographs. Bautze also alerts us to the ex­ amples of the same print reproduced in different published albums being attributed to  different photographers. On the other hand, lithographed views produced from the same  negative in two or three books might appear dissimilar because for example, a part is miss­ ing or a different detail is highlighted. Both Gutschow and Bautze’s contributions are  particularly of documentary value. They alert us to pay attention to how the new ways of  seeing introduced by panoramas are accommodated by Indian painters and map­makers,  the continuities between old and new views of the city even with the introduction of the  new practices of photography. We are alerted to the tangled issues of authorship and origi­ nal image as we not always know who the author of a view was but also that we may not  recognize reproductions produced from the same negative. Well­known cities are usually special in different ways. It is with this idea of the  uniqueness of individual cities that Sandria Freitag approaches the images of Banaras  by comparing it to the images produced of two other urban places – Lucknow and Jaipur.  Freitag is particularly interested in how these cities came to be visualized, how the  intertwined processes of production and consumption resulted in the production of a  </page> <page sequence="4">  Bücherbesprechungen 257  distinctive identity in each city. She highlights the important role played by royal patron­ age in promoting and supporting various craft and artistic traditions, and festivals. The  unique quality that people came to identify with their city was based on its well­known  products and practices. Hence Banaras was well known for its Ram Lila while Lucknow  was famous for its poetry. These kinds of differences, according to Freitag, then helped  to create the image of a place which was then visualized in particular ways and consumed  by visitors and the residents of the city. This is a rich and compelling argument that needs  to be fleshed out and illustrated at length to do adequate justice to it. The fourth and final section of the book turns its attention to social practice and every­ day life. As a sacred city, religion is usually in the foreground in discussions of Banaras.  However, in the final section of the book, religion recedes into the background. Nita  Kumar explores the space of the child, particularly in the home, the neighbourhood and  the city. Kumar shows that the everyday space of the home imposes a discipline on the  body and subjectivity of the child helping to produce a particular subject. Gender divi­ sions between children from the same age are stark with girls showing a preference for the  home while boys are free to roam the neighbourhood and later, as they grow up, the city.  Kumar argues that it is through spatial practices that adults socialize a child. Banaras is also home to distinct ethnic, occupational, caste, religious, and linguistic  communities. Stefan Schütte looks at the washermen (the “Dhobī”) of Banaras to ex­ amine how they effectively collectively organize their living space and community life in  a way that has allowed them to maintain traditional aspects of community organization  while adapting to the challenges of the contemporary era. Schütte reveals the spatial ef­ fects of the multi­layered system of social networking of the dhobīs uncovering the com­ plex geography of this community. In collaboration with Nutandhar Sharma, Martin  Gaenszle examines not a caste community but the Nepali community in Banaras and  the creation of what he refers to as “semi­public” spaces, that is, public spaces that were  intended for the use of the Nepali community. Banaras is well known for its multi­ethnic,  multi­religious, and multi­cultural character and hence like the Bengalis, and Maharash­ trians, the Nepalis are yet another community in this city. However, as Gaenszle points  out it is significant that for centuries pilgrims and rulers of Nepal patronized Kāśī as they  considered it to be part of their tradition and it is only over time that it came to be seen as  a foreign, and not entirely hospitable territory. Through a reading of Premchand’s novel Sevasadan (1918), Vasudha Dalmia investi­ gates the move to drive out the city’s famous courtesans from the locality of the Chauk or  the central square at the heart of the city. Not only did courtesans occupy a central space  in the city but, as Dalmia shows, they were central to the city’s public and cultural life.  Through a close reading of Premchand’s novel, Dalmia shows the various groups and  factions in the Municipal Board in this modernizing city. While the members of the board  were ostensibly interested in the social reform and welfare of the courtesans, Premchand’s  novel reveals that individuals and factions were moved by financial or other interests. In  the novel, the social reformers win and the courtesans are forced to move to the outskirts  of the city. However, as Dalmia notes in a footnote, even though there was an actual  desire to move the courtesans from the city center, it was not carried out and courtesans  continued to live in Dalmandi until the 1950s. As Gengnagel shows in the case of the  public controversy around the Pañcakrośīyātrā, reformers do not always win in reality  even though they are victorious in Premchand’s novel. Despite the fact that some of the authors assume a specialist audience, the ideas of the  individual chapters will hold interest for people from many disciplines. Many of the indi­ vidual essays and the volume as a whole are a significant contribution to our  understanding  </page> <page sequence="5"> 258 Bücherbesprechungen of the city. In their introduction, the editors do a good job of teasing out the main argu­ ments in the essays, many of which are inadequately highlighted in the essays themselves  or tend to get buried under the wealth of detail. The volume is generously illustrated and  the maps are especially effective in revealing Banaras’s spaces to the reader. A glossary  would have been a welcome addition. Scholars from a wide range of disciplines and of diverse interests will find this book  useful. This book will appeal to scholars in religious studies, anthropology, geography,  cartography, urban studies, photography, art history, visual culture, and literature among  other fields. It will also attract those interested in such diverse issues as the relationship  between texts and actual spaces or the mapping of community landscapes in the city. The  volume reminds us why scholars return, again and again, to the multifaceted city of Ba­ naras. On the whole, in its emphasis on space, this volume adds a welcome dimension to  the study of cities and spaces in South Asia. Preeti Chopra, Madison (Wisconsin) R. E. Elson: The Idea of Indonesia. A History. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press  2008. XXVII, 365 S. ISBN 978­0­521­87648­3. £ 55,–. Wie lange gibt es Indonesien schon? Der heutige Nationalstaat Indonesien existiert erst  seit der Unabhängigkeitserklärung von Sukarno und Hatta am 17. August 1945; die  Übertragung der Souveränität über Indonesien von der Regierung der Niederlande an  die Vereinigten Staaten von Indonesien fand erst nach einem blutigen Machtkampf am  27. Dezember 1949 statt. Der australische Geschichtswissenschaftler Robert Elson skiz­ ziert in diesem Buch kenntnisreich die historische Entwicklung des Konzeptes „Indone­ sien“. Seine detaillierte und zusammenhängende Darlegung ist keine bloße Synthese der  Sekundärliteratur, sondern besticht durch fabelhafte Recherche der Primärquellen. Als  ergänzende Lektüre zu einer Vorlesung über die moderne Geschichte Indonesiens ist es  ausgezeichnet geeignet. Der Begriff „Indonesien“ wurde erst im 19. Jahrhundert von europäischen Wissenschaft­ lern verwendet, um die südostasiatische Inselwelt anzudeuten. Dabei war jedoch keinesfalls  definiert, wo die genauen Grenzen lagen: Geographisch könnte „Indonesien“ nicht nur das  Gebiet des heutigen Nationalstaats Indonesien umfassen, sondern auch Melanesien, Poly­ nesien, Mikronesien, die Philippinen, Neuseeland, Madagaskar und die malaiische Halb­ insel. Erst am Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts wurde das Gebiet des heutigen Indonesiens als  politische und administrative Einheit gewaltsam unter niederländischer Kolonialherrschaft  geeint; Gewalt blieb bis heute immer wieder nötig, um diese Einheit zu wahren. Während die niederländischen Kolonialherren ihr Machtgebiet immer offiziell als  „Niederländisch Ost­Indien“ bezeichneten, bekam der Begriff „Indonesien“ rasch poli­ tische Konnotationen. Elson weist darauf hin, dass die kleine Elite der indonesischen  Studenten in den Niederlanden die erste Phase der Deutungshoheit über „Indonesien“ am  Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts entscheidend geprägt hat. Die nationalistischen Bewegungen  der 20er und 30er Jahre in Indonesien waren höchst verschieden, jedoch alle einig darin,  dass „Indonesien“ unabhängig werden sollte. Der Begriff „Indonesien“ blieb sehr lange  konfus und auch geographisch umstritten: Noch im Juli 1945 beschloss der Ausschuss zur  Vorbereitung der Unabhängigkeit, dass Indonesien das Gebiet des ehemaligen Nieder­ ländisch Ost­Indiens, Malaya, die britischen Territorien auf Borneo und (Portugiesisch)  Ost­Timor zu umfassen habe. Im nächsten Monat war Indonesien jedoch auf die heutige  Größe geschrumpft. </page> </plain_text>
