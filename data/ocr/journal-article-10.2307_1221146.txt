Wilshire, Portland, Oregon 97225, 1987, xvii, 433 pp., illus. (color, B&amp;W), ISBN 0-88192-054-1 (hardbound), $50.00. [First publ. by Lothian Publishing Co., Melbourne.] [This book is a must for pteridophiles. David Jones is a profes- sional horticulturist and junior author (with W. R. Elliot) of the authoritative Encyclopedia ofAustralian plants (1980-86, 4 vols., ongoing). The "fern book" (actually "pteridophyte book") is the first of four and briefly treats some 700 species and common cultivars in 185 pages. The present volume is somewhat biased toward southern hemisphere taxa; the remaining volumes will treat the 9000+ species of pteridophytes. Detailed and very informative introductory sections cover morphology and economic botany, cultural requirements, diseases, propagation and hybridization (an especially nice section), and specialized culture. Seven appendices (e.g., taxa for hanging baskets), a glossary, bibli- ography, and index conclude the book. The illustrations are excellent, and the typography exemplary. A few complaints: The author at times indulges in anthropomorphism, though not of the blatant "feet moist, head dry" type. "Ferns" is commonly improperly used for "pteridophytes." The synangia of Marattia are described as sporangia on p. 32 whereas those of Psilophyta are misspelled on pp. 45- 46. The classification system adopted is not especially modern. However, these defects are minor, and in all this is easily the best book on cultivation of pteridophytes. -Rudolf Schmid] Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens, vol. 9, pp. 1-292, 12 Sep. 1986, ISSN 0313-4083, price unknown (from Adelaide Botanic Gardens, North Terrace, Adelaide, South Australia 5000). [With I article: A taxonomic revision of Australian Acanthaceae by R. M. Barker. This treats 28 genera, native and naturalized. There is a fulsome bibliography and an adequate index, but regrettably no index of collections seen with an indication of the identity of each, which is an invaluable addition in any taxonomic work, particularly to specialists and staff of other herbaria faced with the task of bringing their collections into line with the latest monograph or revision.-R.
