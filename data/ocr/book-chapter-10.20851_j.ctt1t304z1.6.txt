<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 4 Framing New Holland or framing a  narrative? A representation of Sydney  according to Charles-Alexandre Lesueur Jean Fornasiero, The University of Adelaide The artists on the Baudin expedition, Charles-Alexandre Lesueur and Nicolas- Martin Petit, left us a substantial legacy in terms of the drawings of antipodean  peoples, landscapes and coastal profiles which they executed during and after  their voyage of scientific discovery to Australia between 1800 and 1804.1 Many  of these works are now well known, thanks to the publication of the various  Atlases of the official account of the expedition, the Voyage de découvertes aux Terres  australes, and their modern facsimile editions.2 Other images, which have remained  1 For a detailed catalogue of the works of Petit and Lesueur and a commentary on their  background, see the following studies: G.

Although  there are some exquisite watercolours of antipodean marine life to be found in  the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, by far the most important  repository of the unpublished drawings and sketches of Lesueur and Petit is the  Lesueur Collection in the Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle of Le Havre.3 Within  (Paris, Imprimerie royale, 1816).

Lesueur, N.-M. Petit and L. Freycinet, Historique, Atlas, 2ème partie  (Paris, Imprimerie Impériale, 1811). A second edition of the official account or, in French,  Historique, combining the two parts of the Atlas in a single volume, appeared in 1824; it  was published in English translation in 2008. See C.-A. Lesueur and N.-M. Petit, Atlas, an  historical record, ed. and trans. P.S.

Given the formal beauty of the image,  we are quite naturally led to regret its exclusion from the Atlas, especially since the  engraved map of Sydney that does feature in it singularly lacks the aesthetic appeal  of the watercolour (Figure 4.2). However, this substitution is only too easily explained. Unlike the engraving,  which Lesueur drew to scale, based on a survey by the expedition's hydrographer,  Charles Boullanger, the watercolour bears no such endorsement as to its accuracy. As  Robert Irving has pointed out: 'Lesueur's map is exquisite, but he was no surveyor.  The map is wrong in a number of respects, including the waterline'.5 Indeed, is it even  a map? Paul Carter describes Lesueur's work more generally as 'poised between rival  visions, between the first impressions appropriate to a logbook and the scientific figures  fit to adorn a scientific treatise'. Lesueur's dual vision thus provides the explanation  for Carter as to why, in the watercolour of Sydney, 'a town plan bends over at its  northern edge to become the distant view of land, the panoptic survey beloved of  the scientific geographer regressing to the record of a traveller's optic turned towards  strange coasts'.6 In any case, as a hybrid representation, the strangely framed town  plan, bearing no indication of scale, could have no place in the scientific record of the  expedition and hence in its Atlas. collections/ca-lesueur/lesueur-peintre-voyageur. 4 I would like to express my grateful thanks to the Curator of the Lesueur Collection,  Gabrielle Baglione, for supplying the images of New Holland (16074-2) and Terre de Diemen:  Tombeaux des Naturels de l'Île Maria (18020), which inspired these reflections.

In C.-A. Lesueur and N.-M. Petit, Historique, Atlas, 2nd edn (Paris, Arthus  Bertrand, 1824), Plate 17. What, then, was Lesueur's intention in composing his work as he did?  There are a number of idiosyncracies present in the painting that may hold a clue.  One feature that is particularly unusual is that Lesueur's watercolour incorporates  into the framework of his map of Sydney and its position on the east coast of the  Australian continent an insert that has no obvious connection to it — that is, a  detail from Geographe Bay, which is situated on the western Australian coast (Figure  4.3). Furthermore, Lesueur did not personally sight the 'sacred grove' he depicted  in the inset; he reconstructed it from François Péron's report. The existence of this  disparate detail within the main frame of the image is surely another reason why the  watercolour was never intended to be a map per se, but a series of impressions grouped  together to form a narrative about the expedition as a whole. 84 </page> <page sequence="5"> Framing French culture There is some evidence to support this view, namely that the detail from  Geographe Bay which Lesueur inserted into his 'Nouvelle Hollande' watercolour  is different from the representation of the same feature in the map of Geographe  Bay which appears in the Atlas of the Voyage (Figure 4.4). The watercolour version  demonstrates a higher level of attention to the hieroglyphic signs that Péron described  as traced in the sand. It takes us away from mere geographical considerations and  into the musings of Péron about the significance of the 'sacred grove' that he was  the only voyager to see and that Lesueur could only imagine. In contrast, the Atlas  version confers on the 'sacred grove' a fixed geographical location within a known  locality. At the same time, the use of a question mark in the title is querying rather  than affirming its religious significance. All things considered, the Atlas version has  all of the qualities of a map, albeit one in which some detail is unverified and hence  uncertain; but in the unpublished watercolour the artist is directing us towards  something else altogether. What, then, are we looking at and why did Lesueur lavish such care and minute  attention to detail on his map of Sydney and its detail of Geographe Bay, if these  disparate elements meant that the map would not meet the standards of geographical  representation required for its inclusion in the Atlas? Does this mean that  Lesueur intended for it to serve  other purposes? Since he left little  in the way of correspondence or  commentary on his work, we must  seek the answers to these questions  principally within the detail of the  maps in question, but also in the  context of the artist's own personal  style and vision.

This is evident both  in the coastal profiles on which he  collaborated with Petit, but also  in his zoological subjects, where  he was able to capture minute  features of tiny marine animals that  he often had only a few precious  moments to observe in all of their  movement and colour.7 Even so,  he found ways of representing  Figure 4.4: Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, his subjects which reflected his  'Bosquet religieux? des Naturels'.

Indeed, in  many of his works that were ostensibly drawn for the purposes of providing support  for scientific observations, he found a means of self-expression that could be ironic,  disarming and often charming — as we can see from his 'family portrait' of the  wombat (Figure 4.6).8 However, he did not just restrict this tendency to his zoological  drawings. His depictions of artefacts in a landscape can also reveal an idiosyncratic  view of his subject or a reflection on his choice of how to represent it. 7 For a detailed study of Lesueur's representations of marine life, see J. Goy, Les Méduses de  Péron et Lesueur, un autre regard sur l'expédition Baudin (Paris, Éditions du C.T.H.S., 1995). 8 Lesueur represented a group of wombats as a 'caring family', attributing to them a set of  behaviours that he could hardly have experienced through scientific observation. Though he  accurately represented the wombats themselves, he imagined their habits and expressions.  Wombats are solitary animals and they only produce one baby annually; see M.L. and R.  Bauchot, 'Dessins de poisson et de mammifères de la collection Lesueur du Muséum  d'Histoire naturelle du Havre', Bulletin trimestriel de la Société géologique de Normandie et des  Amis du Muséum du Havre, 88: 2-4 (2011), pp. 82-3. Lesueur's drawings of animals often  possess an anthropomorphic character — for example, the plates in the Atlas that depict emus  or elephant seals.

The exploration of Maria Island had indeed been an important moment  for the expedition; with the discovery of two native tombs, Péron was now able  to make the kind of detailed ethnographic report his commander had requested  of him.9 Making this find vindicated Péron, who felt slighted by Nicolas Baudin's  Figure 4.7: Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, 'Terre de Diemen: Île Maria.

It has been transcribed and  translated into English as Chapter 6 in Brian Plomley's The Baudin expedition and the  Tasmanian Aborigines, 1802 (Hobart, Blubber Head Press, 1983), pp. 80-95. 88 </page> <page sequence="9"> Framing French culture insinuation, in requesting a report, that he had hitherto neglected this task.10 In  Lesueur's representation of the event, Péron appears centrestage, actively making a  crucial discovery and acting as lead player in the expedition. With ships and other  expeditioners depicted at the margins or in the background, Lesueur is clearly  affirming his friend's status and authority and his own strong belief in Péron's right  to hold them. The care he takes to present the bark engravings in the foreground  (and the bone in Péron's hand) underlines the fact that Péron's authority is scientific  and that the ethnographic dimension to the entire presentation is what lends it its  credibility (Figures 4.8 and 4.9). The fact, too, that Péron is the only expeditioner to be presented as a central  figure in the Atlas of the voyage is even stronger testimony to the seriousness of  Lesueur's intent and his homage. However, is the panegyric the only genre of narrative to be explored within the  engraving? If we look this time at the background to the image, in the vicinity of the  second Aboriginal tomb, another story begins to emerge (Figure 4.10). Figure 4.8: Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, Detail from 'Terre de Diemen: Île Maria.  Tombeaux des naturels'. In C.-A. Lesueur and N.-M. Petit, Historique, Atlas, 2nd  edn (Paris, Arthus Bertrand, 1824), Plate 12. 10 Péron confirms in his introduction that Baudin had 'imposed on [him] the obligation to  occupy [himself ]' with the report and, by way of expressing his personal discomfort that such  a request should be made, offers a series of excuses for having neglected this work up until that  time (Plomley, pp. 83-4). 89 </page> <page sequence="10"> Framing French culture Figure 4.9: Charles-Alexandre Lesueur,  Detail from 'Terre de Diemen: Île Maria.

We see that Péron is not completely alone in his explorations, but that there  are other Europeans present. The botanist Théodore Leschenault, as the discoverer  of the second tomb, is perhaps the figure in this section of the engraving who is  portrayed as closest to the tomb.11 Was Lesueur also being playful by including two  other figures in the frame? Perhaps, since their occupation is not clear — indeed,  they appear to be lurking behind a tree. Yet nothing in this playful background detail  erases the significance of the foreground; it simply adds a human dimension, and  demonstrates that, in Lesueur's eyes, Péron is at the heart of a team enterprise, as well  as leading it. Even though the presence of the tombs adds a note of solemnity to the  scene, the emphasis is not on death itself, but on the activities of the living — in this  case, experiencing the joy of discovery. In this sense, the scene can be described as an  idyll: under sunny skies, in a park-like setting, the expeditioners display a harmony  of purpose which is perfectly in keeping with the natural harmony of the landscape. We could dwell at length on an image that participates in a complex set of  historical narratives that speak of more than the voyage itself. Indeed, we could add  11 Leschenault left a description of his discovery in his journal, which is held in the Archives  Nationales de France, Paris, série Marine, 5JJ56.

Lesueur could  have represented the tomb or tombs Figure 4.11: Charles-Alexandre Lesueur,  'Terre de Diemen: Tombeaux des Naturels  alone if he were simply attempting de l'Île Maria'.

The fact that he  did execute just such a series of drawings, and that these are set out according to the  conventions of the Atlas, confirms that he had seriously contemplated this form of  scientific representation (Figure 4.11). In the version finally chosen for the Atlas, Lesueur's attention was clearly not  focused on the tombs alone, nor was his work guided by purely scientific instructions.  If he included three expeditioners as well as Péron in the depiction of the glorious find,  it was to these three — who must have been recognisable to their fellow travellers —  that Lesueur was also transmitting a message of solidarity and recognition. The hymn  of praise that is the work as a whole is therefore personal on more than one level. If we turn our attention back to 'Nouvelle Hollande', we can see the same  processes operating (Figure 4.1). Firstly, Lesueur clearly did not produce the image in  response to the requirements of a single genre — that is, as a map — as we have seen  from its geographically disparate and unscientific elements. Secondly, its name, in  cartographical terms, is problematic: New Holland is intended to be the all-inclusive  title, as it is for all of the images of mainland Australia in the Atlas, but does the  fact that the name is incomplete in the unpublished watercolour have any particular  significance? Thirdly, the relationship between the vignette and the flow of water at  the top of the map is awkward and does not completely bind all of the sections of  the map together. Finally, as we have previously seen, there are no measurements  to indicate the accuracy of the survey upon which Lesueur designed the map — a  sure sign that we are in the presence less of a map than of a work based on personal  91 </page> <page sequence="12"> Framing French culture reflections, beliefs or feelings. Given that the subject that the artist foregrounds is a  British colony, it may be appropriate, too, to extend our analysis to matters ideological  or even philosophical. Let us start by examining the separate sections of the work one by one before  attempting to determine what may be the general theme and preoccupations to  emerge. To the left, the section that is the continuation of the map of Sydney is  unfinished (Figure 4.12). Figure 4.12: Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, Detail from 'Nouvelle Hollande'. Le  Havre, Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle, Collection Lesueur, 16074-2. 92 </page> <page sequence="13"> Framing French culture It is unframed and does not therefore  counterbalance the right-hand section, which  leads us to ask whether it is an afterthought  or a last-minute extension that would give a  better idea of the expansion of the Colony of  Port Jackson to the west. Since this section  does find its way into the map Lesueur  eventually published in the Atlas, the push  to the west must have been deemed an  important development for the Colony. The  Blue Mountains, in 1802, still constituted a  formidable barrier to unlocking the secrets  of the unknown country which lay to the  west of Sydney.12 In the unfinished version of  the layout of Sydney that we have before us  here, we can only speculate as to why there  was some hesitation in Lesueur's use of his  framing device. But it does seem evident  that he intends to feature Sydney's size and  its expansion, an intention which echoes the  point Péron made in the official account —  that is, that Sydney had achieved a remarkable  degree of growth and development in the short  years of its existence.13 Sydney, according to  Lesueur, is thus even challenging the frames  and boundaries of his map as he constructs it. In contrast, if we then look at the  section to the right, the control of the frame  12 See Figure 4.2.

South Australia, 2006), pp. 293-349. 93 </page> <page sequence="14"> Framing French culture is assured and the viewer's perspective of the Colony is oriented to the east, as the  title of the section indicates (Figure 4.13). Here Lesueur is highlighting the situation of the Colony in relation to its complex  system of waterways and to its natural eastern barrier, the Pacific Ocean. This inset  has none of the accuracy of the map of the same area that featured in the Atlas, but  its function does not appear to be to provide a map per se — rather, its function  is to depict the unique natural setting of Sydney and give some indication of  its terrain. By adopting a bird's-eye view here, Lesueur also makes its protected  situation much clearer than in the conventional map. Sydney, with its narrow  entrance and its myriad inlets, has natural defences. All of the expedition journals,  as well as Péron's plan to invade Sydney14, discuss the difficulty of negotiating  access to the harbour, and Lesueur's emphasis is little different. If we move to the top and centre of the image, the impression that Lesueur  is providing information on his subject is unequivocally reinforced (Figure 4.14).  Within the vignette, however, he supplies two sets of information. The first is a set  of scientific information — the expedition excelled in its collection and description  of native flora and fauna, many examples of which adorn the central section of the  vignette itself. This kind of heraldry forms part of the techniques deployed in the  Atlas maps, where the use of vignettes magnifies the scientific achievements of the  expedition.15 The range of live animals on display surpasses those which were collected  at Port Jackson, which means that part of the message that the vignette transmits  relates to the entire expedition and its contribution to the natural sciences — and  14 The manuscript of the Memoir in which Péron develops a plan to take over the Colony of  Port Jackson is to be found in dossier 12 of the Lesueur Collection at the Muséum d'Histoire  Naturelle of Le Havre. It was first published in French by Roger Martin as 'Mémoire sur les  établissements anglais à la Nouvelle Hollande, à la terre de Diémen et dans les archipels du  grand océan Pacifique', in R. Martin (ed.), 'Le Rêve australien de Napoléon: Description et  projet secret de conquête française', Revue de l'Institut Napoléon, 176: 1 (1998), pp. 4-187.  It has been published in English translation by Jean Fornasiero and John West-Sooby as  French designs on colonial New South Wales: François Péron's memoir on the English settlements  in New Holland, Van Diemen's Land and the Archipelagos of the Great Pacific Ocean, with  an introduction, notes and appendices (Adelaide, The Friends of the State Library of South  Australia, 2014). 15 On the use of vignettes, see J. Fornasiero and J. West-Sooby, 'Cartography as narrative:  The maps of the Baudin expedition', in R. Gerritsen, R. King and A. Eliason (eds), The  Freycinet map of 1811: 200th anniversary of the publication of the first map of Australia (Canberra,  Australia on the Map Division of the Australasian Hydrographic Society, 2012), pp. 20-32. 94 </page> <page sequence="15"> Framing French culture Figure 4.14: Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, Detail from 'Nouvelle Hollande'. Le  Havre, Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle, Collection Lesueur, 16074-2. even more specifically to the achievements of François Péron. The ethnographic  objects that also feature in the vignette leave us in no doubt that the praise the artist  intends is for Péron, whose presence in Lesueur's life and work is inescapable. The  objects themselves were collected in New Holland, as we know from the depiction  of these same artefacts in the Atlas (Figure 4.15). This gives an affirmation of the  importance of the anthropological work during this part of the expedition and a sense  of continuity to Péron's endeavours. If we return to the question of location, Sydney, from the perspective of scientific  collecting, is not being viewed in isolation; the animals are characteristic of Australia  as a whole and ethnography is a key part of the expedition's mission. In this way the  vignette shows Sydney as central to the entire enterprise that was the Baudin voyage  to Australia, even though the Colony was not originally designated as one of the  expedition's stopovers. Sydney, in this representation, also appears as an integral part  of the land known as New Holland, a fact which the expedition also helped to clarify  through its cartographic work. By charting the unknown south coast of Australia and  by confirming, along with Matthew Flinders, that the west coast of New Holland  did indeed join the east coast of New South Wales, Baudin and his men acquired  the certainty that New Holland was part of a continent, of which Sydney was the  hub in terms of economic development. The vignette metaphorically contributes to  our understanding of the title, 'New Holland', which appears, incomplete, hesitant,  immediately above. In contrast to the barely articulated title, Lesueur's painting as  a whole affirms confidently that New South Wales and New Holland are part of the  same landmass. 95 </page> <page sequence="16"> Framing French culture Figure 4.15: Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, 'Nouvelle-Hollande: Vases, armes,  pêche'. In C.-A. Lesueur and N.-M. Petit, Historique, Atlas, 2nd edn (Paris, Arthus  Bertrand, 1824), Plate 30. However, this is by no means all that the vignette has to say. If we turn to the list  contained within it, we can see that Lesueur is supplying, through the list of buildings  in the Colony, a second set of information that we could consider strategic. It is not,  after all, akin to a tourist map, for the buildings' names speak of resources, industries  96 </page> <page sequence="17"> Framing French culture and economic development, but  they also tell of defences and means  of communication. In short, the  buildings are the sites associated  with authority and the protection of  the Colony, its organisation and its  social fabric. As a group of buildings  they are strategically significant.  One might well argue that the few  buildings Lesueur designated were Figure 4.16: Charles-Alexandre Lesueur,  all that existed, but this is belied by Detail from 'Nouvelle Hollande'.  Le Havre, Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle,  the completed map, with its greatly Collection Lesueur, 16074-2. expanded list of sites (Figure 4.2).16  The final version is a bona fide map, as we have seen. Its function is to be as informative  as possible to the reader of the voyage account — a reader who would also be seeking  to follow the adventures of the Voyage's narrator as he travels through an unfamiliar  location. The extreme degree of the details reinforces this impression — the body  attached to the gibbet being a salutary reminder that the adventurer in question is in  a land of moral challenges and marked social contrasts (Figure 4.16). In the case of Lesueur's vignette, however, the details are less numerous, the  buildings more significant in their set of strategic functions. Interestingly, they are  also set within an image that reflects Lesueur's desire to show the countryside as  partly in relief and partly reflecting the garden-type verdure that so greatly impressed  Baudin and his men. This is a desirable location, its defences exposed to the gaze of  the covetous viewer. This is again a representation that reinforces Péron's conviction  that the Colony is a prize that needs to be captured. Thus far, the message that we can derive from this group of images is clear  and unambiguous. Lesueur's representation of Sydney parallels the message that  Péron expressed in covert terms in the Voyage and openly in the Memoir, in which  he proposed the conquest of Sydney, now seen to be the key to access and colonial  success in New Holland and in the Pacific region onto which it abuts. Lesueur's  acquiescence to Péron's views and his continued admiration for his friend's scientific  16 The number of buildings and sites listed in the plan of Sydney that features in the Atlas  is thirty-eight, in contrast with the twelve locations that feature in the watercolour. 97 </page> <page sequence="18"> Framing French culture and ethnographic accomplishments also underpin this set of images, as they do his  more homogeneous depiction of the Maria Island tombs. Before we draw our final  conclusions on the artistic form of support which Lesueur offers to Péron's narrative  — a form of support and dependency that is, so far, quite conventional in terms of  the production of a travel account and its illustrations — let us consider one last  important element, one that is both distinctly less susceptible to the same kind of  explanation and offers the same kind of personal intervention that is akin to the  image of the men lurking behind the tree on Maria Island. I refer to the third inset,  to the left of the vignette (Figure 4.3). How do we explain the presence of an inset here of a map of a grove in  Geographe Bay? It is true that we have now established that, for the expeditioners,  New South Wales and New Holland were part of the same continent. This means  that a location on the west coast of Australia fits well enough under the general title  of 'New Holland', which is ascribed to the image as a whole. But why does Lesueur  depict it here and how does it relate exactly to the map of Sydney, with all of its  strategic implications and scientific importance? Firstly, it is unlike the other sections  of the drawing, in that the map of the grove represents no known and surveyed  locality. The only knowledge of its existence stems from the description of it given  by Péron, who reported that he stumbled upon a clearing that had every appearance  of being a meeting place for Aboriginal peoples of the area — and a site of religious  significance at that, in the light of the carefully designed space and what Péron took  to be a series of symbols marked out by reed segments and traced in the sand. No  other expeditioners sighted it and Péron saw no Aboriginal people frequenting it. Yet  Péron was so struck by the sight that he speculated at length about its significance in  the report on Geographe Bay that he made to his commander.17 In the Voyage, he insisted that an image of the grove, as he himself had sketched  it, must appear as an inset to the map of Geographe Bay.18 For him, the reason was  two-fold. The grove was a sacred site which provided him with the evidence that  the Aborigines had an active spiritual life and were capable of abstract thinking, as  evidenced by the forms of symbolic writing that were inscribed into their site and that  17 Péron's description of the 'sacred grove' is to be found in volume 1, chapter V of Voyage  to the southern lands, pp. 65-7. 18 See Figure 4.3. Péron mentions in the same chapter of the Voyage that he specifically  instructed Lesueur to include the 'sacred grove' in the chart of Geographe Bay (p. 67). 98 </page> <page sequence="19"> Framing French culture he likened to both Runic figures and hieroglyphs. He believed himself to be in the  presence of a high civilisation like that of the ancient Egyptians. Péron had not met  any Aborigines in this part of Australia and his opinion stood in stark contrast to those  of his companions who had experienced disappointing and aggressive encounters and  were not unaware of Dampier's view that here were to be found the 'miserablest  people in the world'.19 Péron was himself to be disappointed some months later by the  encounters he finally experienced with the Indigenous inhabitants of D'Entrecasteaux  Channel.20 His conclusions concerning the future prospects of Aboriginal culture  were formulated as a result — namely that the only way for the native peoples of  Australia to thrive was for them to be integrated into European civilisation.21 This  being so, what are we to make of Péron's belief that persisted well beyond his time  in Australia, and well after he had expressed his thoughts on the native population of  Australia, that the 'sacred grove' of Geographe Bay was a major find in anthropological  terms and must be recorded in the Voyage and in its illustrations? How was this find  compatible with all that Péron had observed and concluded? The only possible explanation is that Péron needed to retain his major  anthropological moment on the Australian continent.22 The rest of his research  had not produced the conclusions he had originally hoped for, nor had it brought  19 W. Dampier, A new voyage round the world (London, The Argonaut Press, 1927),  p. 312. Dampier's work, originally published in 1697, was included in the library of both  the Géographe and the Naturaliste, and Baudin referred to it frequently in his journal. See  N. Baudin, The journal of Post-Captain Nicolas Baudin, Commander-in-Chief of the Corvettes  Géographe and Naturaliste assigned by order of the Government to a voyage of discovery, trans.  C. Cornell (Adelaide, Libraries Board of South Australia, 1974), pp. 592-3, 600. Even Péron  concluded, upon seeing some native huts in Geographe Bay, that 'we were a very long way  from having observed on these shores the extreme limit of ignorance and misery ... ' (Voyage  to the southern lands, vol. 1, p. 71). 20 See the full account of the evolution in Péron's thinking in R. Jones, 'Images of natural  man', in Bonnemains, Forsyth and Smith, pp. 35-64. 21 See, for example, Péron's musings about bringing the Aboriginal populations of Sydney  to a 'civilised' state, Voyage to the southern lands, vol. 1, p. 367. 22 Susan Hunt and Paul Carter also attach to the inset of the 'sacred grove' of Geographe  Bay a desire on the artist's part to reflect on the anthropological record of the expedition. For  them, this detail in the watercolour of Sydney 'seems incongruous but is perhaps intended as  a reference to the spiritual life of a culture, certainly only imperfectly glimpsed, but that in  Sydney had only too clearly been fractured'. (See Hunt and Carter, Notes, p. 60.) I disagree  with the second term of the contrast they make, in that there is nothing in the watercolour  itself to suggest the degradation of Aboriginal life. The overall message that emanates from the  work is positive and harmonious. 99 </page> <page sequence="20"> Framing French culture release from his commander's critical gaze. Psychologically, at least, he required a  space in which he observed, collected and analysed material on his own — no longer  the trainee, but already the chief scientist. He had a narrative that no-one could  contradict; it was uplifting and gave him a role which he was only too content to play,  that of interpreter of higher truths, the mediator between higher forms of culture and  language. If other members of the expedition were not entirely convinced by Péron's  experience of Aboriginal culture, in that it in no way mirrored their actual experience  of contact, Lesueur as always demonstrated his fidelity to, if not admiration for, the  man who had helped him to enter a new and more highly intellectual world. By  taking the young artist under his wing and teaching him how to make his art co-habit  with scientific precision, Péron had done much more than find an exemplary partner;  he had helped to form an artist who would serve the cause of Péron himself as much  as the cause of scientific accuracy. The inclusion of the 'sacred grove' from Geographe  Bay reflects Lesueur's view that Australia is a single continent and that Péron has left  his indelible mark upon it. This territory extended from Geographe Bay, where Péron  obtained insights of which no other was capable, to Sydney, which he intended to  conquer and possess. This is the subtext to the inset of the grove, which no doubt provides the  principal thread of the narrative which Lesueur has inscribed within his representation  of Sydney. If the 'sacred grove' is the key to decoding a message in Lesueur's 'New  Holland', then it is a message that is truly personal, for there is no overwhelmingly  practical reason why this element would feature in a map of Sydney. This inset thus  adds a level of commentary that the other sections do not convey and it makes sense  of the stuttered title of the work as a whole. Indeed, it makes sense of the stutter and,  finally, gives us an even stronger sense of why Lesueur was unable to complete his  work than simply the inaccuracy of his map. Inaccuracies can be fixed; an overly idiosyncratic and lyrical view of place  cannot be so readily transformed. The discreet man that was Lesueur had perhaps  gone further than he had intended in his lyrical assessment of a colony, a voyage and a  friend, and he may even have realised himself that his view of Sydney was inappropriate  for an illustration that was meant to highlight the geographical. Indeed, his work  had spoken words that he was incapable of expressing in conventional ways. If he  had managed to include a similar narrative in his Atlas illustration of the Tasmanian  tombs, it was precisely because he had remained within the limits of convention,  100 </page> <page sequence="21"> Framing French culture except for the microscopic detail. In his 'Nouvelle Hollande', his framing devices  had breached the borders of his ostensible subject. However, while he did not ever  publish his lyrical tableau, he did not suppress its message. He preserved it amongst  his papers, as a tribute to Péron, and as a narrative that can now be deciphered by a  far greater audience than the readership of the Voyage for which it was once hesitantly  intended.
