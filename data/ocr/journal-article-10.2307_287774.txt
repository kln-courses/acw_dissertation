SEVENTH SERIES.1 I.-THE MYTH OF THE HEAVENLY EYE-BALL, WITH REFERENCE TO RV . . 40. 9. The pretty wonder of the eye-ball has not failed to stimulate the fancy of the Hindus, and especially to arouse their tale- making instincts. When a Hindu perceives a relation, an analogy, he is usually not content merely,to note it and to derive from it what comfort he may. He is given to eager exploitation, to restless following out of consequences, and, as relations and analogies are in general partial and defective, this deficiency in restraint leads to excess. One would wish to tie a string to their fancy, so as to draw it back when it threatens to lose itself in vagary and to secure it against the just charge of grotesqueness and futility. Thus, for instance, the attractive legend of the moun- tains, which has become a stock theme of the Hindu romancers 1 The preceding series of these studies were published as follows: First Series (under the title 'Seven Hymns of the Atharva-Veda'): Amer.

It is told very tersely in the Maitrayani-Safmhita i. Io. I3: 'The mountains are the oldest children of Prajapati (the creator). They had wings. They flew away wherever they willed. Then this (earth) became unstable. Indra cut off their wings, and steadied this (earth) by means of these (mountains). The wings became clouds. Therefore the clouds are ever floating towards the mountains, for this is their place of origin.'l The story, neat as it is, just skirts and barely escapes the domain of the bizarre; another touch of the same kind of fancy added would make it distinctly disobedient to our sense of fitness and measure, to our instinct of drawing the line at the right place. The Hindu commentators designate such legends as dkhydyikd 'little stories,' and the Brahmanas abound in them especially. As a rule they are repeated in a considerable number of texts, but every writer adds touches of his own, outbidding, as it were, his predecessor; hence the task of stripping them of these indi- vidual aberrant fancies and subtilities, of extracting from them their simpler human elements, the traits that are likely to have sprung spontaneously and genuinely from the folk, is both important and difficult. The old designations of the eye-ball are kanZnaka, masculine; kanznakd, kanZnikd and kandnakd (TS. v. 7. I2), feminines. These words, like Lat. pfi illa, pupula, have the double meaning of 'little boy, or girl' and 'eye-ball.'2 'When the gods slew the Asura-Raksas (demons), then (usna the Danava (a particular demon) falling backward entered into the eyes of men: he is the pupil of the eye (kanznaka), and looks like a young lad (kumd- 1Cf. Lanman's Reader, notes, p. 393b; Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, p. I74. 2This statement needs to be circumscribed in the light of the present investigation. While there need be no doubt about the etymological deri- vation of kanznaka and the corresponding feminines, there will be left, the careful reader may observe, no instance in which these words mean 'boy' or 'girl.' The words everywhere mean 'pupil of the eye.' Thus also in the stanza RV. iv. 32. 23, which has perplexed the interpreters from the time of Yaska, Nirukta iv. 15, to Professor Henry, Memoires de la Societe de linguis- tique, IX, pp. o06 ff. The expression kanznakgva is, as Henry justly observes, to be resolved into kanznaki iva, but kantnaki is pretty certainly the dual of a masculine kanznakd. The comparison is between Indra's two (masculine) steeds which shine (fobhete) like two eye-balls. It would seem that the eye- balls in a little figure (idol?) are the source of the comparison, but I have nothing to offer except the conviction that kanmnaka here, as everywhere else, means ' eye-ball.' 400</page><page sequence="3">THE INTERPRETATION OF THE VEDA. raka).' So says CB. iii. I. 3. I1.1 This dkhydyikd well illustrates our introductory statement: the comparison of the eye-ball with a boy is universally human; we may also grant that here and there the dark diminutive denizens of the pupil were suspected as little devils; but beyond that we are surely dealing with the individual, not over-felicitous attempt to turn crude folklore into concinnate myth. The story in this form is never repeated. The eye is divided either into two parts, the light (rukla) and the dark (krsna)2; or into three parts, the light, the dark, and the pupil (kanznaka).' Now, the Hindus, just as the Greeks, love to correlate the eye with the cosmic eye, the sun,4 and by synecdoche the pupil is also thus correlated, as, e. g., (B. xiv. 5. 2. 3 = Brh. Ar. Up. ii. 2. 2. The sun, however, is but one form of heavenly light; another is the lightning, as it were the majestic glance of heaven. Accordingly, we find the correlation of the pupil with lightning expressed in direct terms. In VS. xxv. I, 2; TS. v. 7. I2; MS. iii. 15. I, 2, at the horse-sacrifice, the separate parts of the horse are offered to divinities and quasi-divinities on the ground of cosmic correspondences; e. g. the breath of the animal is offered to the wind, etc.; the two pupils to lightning. Now takes place the following delicate leger-de-main. Man's eye has been correlated with the sun or the lightning: how easy it is to say next that the sun has an eye or that the lightning has an eye! Accordingly, in VS. iv. 32 we have the formula: 'Get up to the eye of Sarya (the sun), to the pupil of Agni's eye.' The use of the formula is stated Katy. ?r. vii. 9. 9: a black antelope's skin is fastened to a staff in front of the soma-cart to serve as a sort of a flag, destined to chase away demons from the sacrificial place. Mahidhara explains that the flag attracts the attention of and is seen by the eye of Sarya and the pupil of Agni's eye. In TS. vi. I. 7. 3 (cf. i. 2. 4. I), where the same formula is employed, we have an implicit commentary upon this performance: 'Verily that path is not injured by the demons, that belongeth to Agni and Sarya. He (therefore) pronounces the formula: ' I have gotten up to the eye of Sarya to the pupil of 'Cf. Maitr. S. 3.6.6 (p. 66,1. I4 ff.). In (B. xiv. 5. 3.5 = Brh. Ar. Up. ii. 3. 5 the wordpurusa 'person' is substituted for kaninaka. 2E.g. g.B. xiii. 4. 2. 3. 3 B. xii. 8. 2. 26; xiii. 4. 2. 4. 4 itoet6iSoraov ye ol/tat (ro 6Bitza) rTv 7repi rac aia6^gecp bopyavwv (Plato, Repub. 508). Cf., e. g., Ait. Ar. ii. 4. 2. 40I</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. Agni's eye." Then he gets up to a path that is not injured by the demons.' Similarly MS. i. 2. 5; iii. 7. 7 (p. 84, 1. Io). We have thus arrived at the definite, not at all strange, result that heavenly lights are conceived as having an eye and a pupil: the Agni spoken of in this connection is either the god Agni (fire) in general, or more specifically the lightning, the heavenly Agni; cf. the author's 'Hymns of the Atharva-Veda,' Sacred Books of the East, vol. XLII, p. 401. Having thus far dealt with conceptions that are universally human and are likely to crop out anywhere, we come next to an important mythical feature which is characteristically Hindu, the changes upon which are rung in a great number of Vedic texts. The eye and the eye-ball of these heavenly lights, as well as of more completely anthropomorphic divinities substituted for them, is conceived of as descending upon earth and there turning into a considerable variety of pleasing and useful objects. The inner- most kernel of these little myths seems to be that plants are the upshot of the descent of the eye-ball; in other words, that the glances of the heavenly eyes as they are shot down upon earth do not pass away without result, but are fruitful: the eye-balls of the heavenly eyes fall upon earth to rise in the form of plants. Who does not at once think of the sunflower (helianthos, sonnen- blume) as a possible, one might say logically necessary, source of such conceptions ? AV. iv. 20. 3 is addressed to a plant which Kaugika 28. 7 conceives to be the sadarmpiuspd 'ever-flowering' (schol. trisam- dhyd): 'Thou art verily the eye-ball of the divine eagle'; thou didst ascend the earth as a weary woman a palanquin.' The plant is worn as an amulet designed to expose hidden demons, wizards, and their hostile practices. He that wore the amulet must have surely reasoned: 'I have with me the eye-ball of the heavenly eagle, no demoniac forces will escape its scrutiny.' The heavenly eagle is either the sun or the lightning, each of which owns the epithet. In this instance I incline to lightning, being reminded of the legend of the rape of the soma by the heavenly eagle. That, I believe I have shown, means the descent of the lightning along with the rain, the heavenly fluid; see Contri- butions, Fifth Series, Journ. Amer. Or. Soc. XVI I ff. The descent of this eagle is disturbed by a heavenly archer Krganu, 1Cf. Apast. Cr. 6. 20. 2. 402</page><page sequence="5">THE INTERPRETATION OF THE VEDA. who wounds the eagle so that he loses a feather, which falls to the earth and grows up as a plant or tree. Obviously the last touch is a variant form of our myth: the lightning is not sown, as it were, into the earth without growing up again.1 But, further, the same plant, the sadaimpuspd, is addressed in stanza 7 of the hymn so as to leave no doubt that it is conceived also as the off- shoot of the sun's eye: 'Thou art the eye of Kagyapa, and the eye of the four-eyed bitch. Like the sun moving in the bright day make thou the Pigaca (demon) evident to me!' Aside from this statement that introduces the sun directly, both Kagyapa and the four-eyed bitch are quickly reducible to terms of the sun. Kacyapa is a name to conjure with in the Atharvan writings: amulets and charms handled by him are peculiarly powerful; e.g. i. 14. 4; iv. 37. I; viii. 5. 14. He rises to the dignity of the supreme self-existing being (svayamh-bh1) in AV. xix. 53. IO; cf. also TS. v. 6. i. I, and see the Pet. Lex., s. v. 2b. He is intimately related with forms of the sun, Surya and Savitar, as is stated expressly in Tait. Ar. i. 7. I; see also TAit. Ar. i. 8. 6, and compare TS. v. 6. i. I with AV. i. 33. Ib, a comparison that yields the equation Ka9yapa = Savitar (the sun). In fact, Kagyapa is the sun as a tortoise, that creeps its slow course across the sky; cf. the conceptions of the sun as a hermit, and as a Brahman disciple, AV. xi. 5, introduction (Sacred Books of the East, XLII, p. 626). With this knowledge in mind Tait. Ar. i. 8. 8 puns upon the name, kayaapah paryako bhavatiyat sarva?h parizpayai ' Kafyapa is the seer because he looks over the all.' To say of a plant that it is the eye of the four-eyed bitch is certainly startling, but it is not difficult to coax the conception into line with those preceding. The 'four-eyed bitch' is Sarama, the mother of the two four-eyed dogs of Yama (the Cerberi), (?yama and (abala, and they are the sun and moon; see Journ. Amer. Or. Soc. XV 163 if.; SBE. XLII 404. The two heavenly dogs are frequently designated by their metronymic sdrameya, and the substitution of the mother for one of them, the sun, would have required no violent tour de force. But one cannot say with certainty that this is so: we shall next meet with plants that are the eye-ball of still other anthropomorphic divinities. 1 Another myth which derives a valuable plant, the kustha (costus speciosus), from heaven is told AV. v. 4. 3-6; vi. 95. I, 2; xix. 39. 6-8: kustha is brought down from heaven by a golden ship (soma the moon), and deposited upon the Himalaya Mountains. See Sacred Books, XLII 415. 403</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. Yet another point belongs to the definite equipment of the myth. The verbs which ordinarily describe the descent of the eye are from the root pat 'fall' or 'fly' with or without the preposition para 'away.' Thus TS. vi. 4. Io. 5: 'Prajapati's eye swelled,' it fell away (or, flew away); it entered a vikaikata-tree,2 but did not stay in the zikankata. It entered the barley: in the barley it remained'; MS. iv. 6. 3: 'Prajapati's left eye swelled. The tears which dropped from it, they cause rain here (upon earth) . . . His eye-ball fell away; that became barley'; (B. iv. 2 . I. I: 'Varuna once struck King Soma right in the eye, and it swelled (afvayat): therefrom a horse (afva) sprung; and because it sprung from a swelling, therefore it is called afva. A tear of his fell down: therefrom the barley sprung.' The story strays still farther away from the original motifs in TS. v. 3. 12. ; TB. i. I. 5. 4; gB. xiii. 3. I. I, yet not without retaining some of the features of the original conceptions that gave rise to it: 'Praja- pati's eye swelled, it fell away, and became a horse. Because it swelled (afvayal) therein lies the horse-nature of the horse (afvasyd '?valvam).' One can almost see how the pretty original came to be debased into the service of this clap-trap pun: since the eye fell out it must have swelled first (afvayat), and no normally built Brahmana-writer could fail, with a self-satisfied leer towards his own literary discrimination, to bring in the horse (afva) through the wide-open door of this pun. Therefore the true elements of the myth thus far are the correlation of the human (or animal) eye with the sun, or light- ning; the consequent endowment of the sun or lightning with an eye, or pupil of its own; the poetic supposition that plants (primarily, perhaps, sun-like plants) are due to the descent of the eye or pupil upon the earth. The transfer of the eye from the sun to other divinities would in the long run be hardly avoided. But there is yet another aspect which the myth-makers have bravely availed themselves. What comes from the eye, especially the divine eye, is good for the eye3: it was therefore sure to be correlated with that substance which ordinary experi- ence has taught the Hindus to use on their own eyes-namely, 'Cf. Tait. Ar. i. 4. I. 2 Flacourtia sapida roxburghiensis, a thorny plant. 3 Conversely, the divine eye may harm the eye of man, for it is related that Janaka, the king of Mithila, did not revere the sun, for which he was afflicted with the diseases of the eye; see Wise, Hindu Medicine, p. 29r. 404</page><page sequence="7">THE INTERPRETA TION OF THE VEDA. eye-ointment or collyrium (anjana)-especially as these sub- stances were derived from plants, themselves conceived the product of the heavenly eye. All India loves collyrium. Though by itself unsightly, it imparts a charm that is in turn reflected upon itself.1 It is, too, full of virtue, driving out disease, prolonging life, destroying demons. Its origin is on the rivers (Yamuna and Indus) and the high mountains of the Himalaya (AV. iv. 9; xix. 44). Especially the mountain Trikakud or Trikakubh 'Three-peaks,' the later Trikata, is famed as the source of the salve: it is accordingly designated as trdikakudam.2 Since it does not count among the habits of salve to flow in rivers, or to bubble up from mountain springs, we may suppose that vegetable ingredients from river- banks and mountain-heights were used in the composition. Probably the kustha-plant (costus speciosus), still known in Kashmir and Kabul as an aromatic plant, the plant which itself descended upon the mountains in a golden ship,3 is especially in the mind of the poets. It is placed by the side of ointment, licorice and spikenard, AV. vi. 102, and women appear to be designated as 'fond of kuqha,' AV. xix. 39. 9.4 In this way we can understand how the writer, AV. xix. 44. 5, can address collyrium as the flower of lightning . . ., the sun, the eye; i. e. the plants which go to make it up are the product of the heavenly eye or glance in accordance with the main motif of the myth. But the ordinary poetic formula addressed in the (rhuta-texts to collyrium states outright its derivation from a heavenly eye. VS. iv. 3; (B. iii. I. 3. 15; K(;. vii. 2. 34: 'Thou art the pupil of Vrtra's eye; eye-giving thou art: give me the eye.' Or TS. i. 2. I. 2; MS. i. 2. i; Ap. (r. x. 7. i: 'Thou art the pupil of Vrtra's eye; eye-protecting art thou: protect my eye.' The Brahmana-texts equip this formula with a legend which echoes the legend of the pupil and the plants perfectly. Thus TS. vi. i. I. 5: 'Indra slew Vrtra, the pupil of his eye fell away, it became collyrium. When he anoints himself he plucks the very eye of his enemy'; MS. iii. 6. 3: 'Indra slew Vrtra, the pupil of his eye fell away, it went to mount Trikakubh. Therefore he anoints himself with ointment from mount Trikakubh'; (B. iii. I. 3. I2: 1 B6htlingk's Indische Spriiche2, I592, 2146, 7568. Cf. Tait. Ar. I. 4. I. 2 Cf. Indische Studien, I 78. 3 See the note on p. 403; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 63 ff. 4 The text is not quite certain; see Sacred Books, XLII 68o. 405</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. '(Ointment) is such as comes from mount Trikakud: for when Indra slew Vrtra he transformed that eye of his into the mount Trikakud. The reason, then, why (ointment) from mount Trikakud (is used) is that he thereby puts eye into eye.' The present connection with the myth of Vrtra, rather than the sun, may be due to special emphasis laid upon the devil-like appear- ance of the pupil, implied in the legend, (B. iii. I. 3. ii. Or we shall do well to remember that the mention of a single part of the body is itself suggestive of Vrtra: this cloud-demon, after he has been cleft by Indra, is almost invariably depicted by the legends as being dismembered. The stories usually play pranks in a vindictive way with Vrtra's limbs, head, nose, etc. See the article on rujanah below. We must not, however, press matters too much in the Brahmanas: the main ingredients of the original myth, the heavenly pupil (kaninikd), its descent (pard pat), and its growth as a plant on the earth are obviously present in this modified version of the legend. The preceding picture of a Hindu notion, in itself not without interest, rises to a higher plane of usefulness because it, and it alone, furnishes the hermeneutical apparatus for the interpretation of RV. x. 40. 9, and because it illustrates anew the important principle that the Vedas are essentially a unit. The so-called later parts of the Veda-later in redaction and form, but frequently earliest in subject-matter-especially the prose books, at times state in plain language what is presented in the hymns with a degree of obscurity approaching to what the Norse skalds called a kenning. After what has been reported above, the interpreta- tion of the stanza in question, even in the eyes of lay readers, will appear impossible without reference to the myth of the eye- ball, and, conversely, it will be of interest to find this curious conception dealt with familiarly in the earliest document of India. RV. x. 40. 9 reads: jdnista ydsd patayal kaninakd vi ca 'r uhan virzidho dansdnd dnu 'a smai riyante nivane 'va sindhavo 'sma dhne bhavali fact palitvandm. Grassmann translates: 'Geboren ward das midchen und der knabe lief, und pflanzen sprossen auf durch eure wunderkraft. Zu diesem rinnen str6me nieder wie in's thal, und die vermiihlung ist an diesem tage ihm.' Ludwig's rendering is: 'Erzeugt hat 406</page><page sequence="9">THE INTERPRETATION OF THE VEDA. das weib, das kind fiel heraus; es erhoben sich die schonen wunder da, die pflanzen. Ihm fliessen, wie auf abschiissigem grunde die fliisse zu; dises (diser) vorrecht wird disem tage.' Both translators are debarred from a true appreciation of the stanza by the absence in their philological apparatus of the m)yth sketched above. Therefore they take kanmnakd in its primary sense of 'knabe,' or 'kind,'1 instead of the secondary sense of 'eye-ball, pupil.' But with the story in mind, the juxtaposition in the stanza of the three catchwords of the myth: pat 'fall,' kanmnakd 'eye-ball,' and vzrudhah 'plants,' narrows down the possibilities of its interpretation so that no great mistake can be made. The stanza pictures a bright and glorious wedding-day. The entire hymn is addressed to the Acvins, apparently with special reference to the legend of the princess Ghcsa. The latter, who had lived to be a little passee, yet very desirous of a husband, is known to have appealed to the Acvins for succor. The A9vins, according to the myth elsewhere, granted her request, this graciousness of theirs being one of the noteworthy achievements for which they are extolled.2 The Acvins are in general medi- ators of marriages and protectors of connubial happiness.3 In the first eight stanzas the Acvins are called and their manifold wonderful helpful deeds are recited. In stanza 5 the story of Ghosa is alluded to; at the end of st. 9 some one, either Ghosa's bridegroom or an ordinary human bridegroom in whose behalf the poet has composed the hymn, is described as being in the act of marrying on a wondrously beautiful and auspicious day: 'The maiden (dawn, Usas) was born; the (sun's) eye-ball fell, and the plants sprung up through the magic deed. To him the rivers flow as though down a declivity: this marriage on this day does come about.' The only point that stands in need of comment is the rendering of janista yosd. Ludwig's rendering, 'erzeugt hat das weib,' is contrary to the uses of the root jan, which has the meaning 'to beget' only in the causative. Grassmann's 'geboren ward das maidchen' is correct as to its wording, but stands in need of 1 So also the Pet. Lex., s. v. 2): ' madchen, jungfrau,' and Sayana, kanydkdmah patih. 2 See especially RV. i.

The maiden here is she of whom RV. x. 3. 2 states that Agni 'when he has overcome the black variegated (night) with his luminous form, begets the maiden, the daughter of the lofty father,1 and establishes on high the radiance of the sun'; cf. also RV. i. 92. II; IoI. 7; I23. 9; vii. 75. 5. The maiden is Usas; the lofty father is the sky. After night first comes aurora, then the sun. Agni is the fire lighted in the early morning, the herald of nature's activity in passing from night through dawn to day; see Journ. Amer. Or. Soc. XVI 36. The remaining stanzas of RV. x. 40 are also wedding stanzas: Io, 12 and 13 figure in the wedding-book of the AV. (xiv. I. 46; 2. 5, 6), and they are rubricated in a variety of Satras in their chapters on the marriage ceremonies. II.-THE ORIGINAL daksind, OR FEE OF THE PRIESTS. Professor Windisch, in a luminous article published in the 'Festgruss an Otto von Bihtlingk' (1888), pp. 115 ff., has shown that the Vedic compound istadprl&amp; is a copulative compound; that its two members are participles, respectively from the roots yaj 'to sacrifice' and par (fr) 'to present with'; and that the copulative compound means 'that which has been sacrificed (to the gods), and that which has been given as a present (to the priests).' He has thus added to a now rapidly growing list one more instance which shows that the ritualistic texts know the true meanings of Vedic words, and that, when not engaged upon the mission of phantastic perversion, they are perfectly capable of transmitting this information to attentive readers. A good example, calculated to remove any lingering doubt, is presented in AV. vii. 103. I, where the two actions are stated in the form of abstracts: kd asya no druho 'vadyavdlyd un nesyati ksatriyo vdsya ichdn ko yajndkdmah kd u pvrtikdmal k6 dev.su vanute dzrghdm iyuzh. Prof. Ludwig, Der Rig-Veda, III 269, ingeniously construes this as the plaintive ejaculation ('stossseufzer') of a Brahman out of employment: 'What king, desirous of more possessions, will get us out of this wretched misery ? Who is desirous of sacrificing, 'Here correctly the causative of jan, to wit: jandyan yosdm brhatdh piti'r jiIm. 408</page><page sequence="11">THE INTERPRE TA TION OF THE VEDA. and who of making presents? Who asks for long life from the gods?' But as Prof. Henry, Le livre VII de l'Atharva-Veda, p. II6, remarks, the word druhod is not a little strange in such an appeal'; the word savors rather of the popular mind (rak.sas, demon), and may be an appeal in time of general misery to the king, urging him to greater acts of piety in order to stop the public evil and at the same time to increase his own prosperity.2 There is in either case no question but what yajn~a and parti refer to the sacrifice and the daksi.nad, the istam and the pzlrtam; cf. also the expression yajfiAh pip.rhi in AV. vii. 20. 4; 79. I. In the following I wish to add some remarks by way of defining more sharply the conception of the parli. It is interesting, in the first place, to find the word dak.sinzd employed as a complete synonym of the parlanm. So in AV. xviii. 3. 20 y8 dlrayo d;ngiraso n6vagvd iStavanto radisa'co dddhand.h, diksinadvantah sukrtoya u sthd ... Here ista'vantah and ddksizndvanlah speak for themselves (cf. AV. xviii. 4. 29). In AV. iv. II. 4 yajnSdi. pdyo ddkqi.nd ddho asya the juxtaposition of yajnald and ddk.ina is equally intentional; the word parti might have stood in the place of dak.si.nd without altering the sense; cf. Gop. Br. i. I. 33. Note especially AV. x. 6. 34, where an amulet of khadira-wood is addressed as yajniavardhana ... fatadaksi.na. The passage involves a delicate oratio pro domo on the part of the priest who has prepared the amulet; the real meaning of the epithets is: 'as I, the priest, have by means of this amulet made thy sacrifice successful, thus do thou, the king, permit thyself to be inspired to reward me, the priest, by a gift of a hundred cows.' In AV. vi. 53. I we have ddkqi.nayd pipartu, which is the equivalent of *par- lena fiiparlu. In AV. viii. Io. 4 yajindrlo daksin?yo... bhavali 1 Sya.na: nindyariipddiyuktdya druhah drogdhryah. 2 The question is complicated by the employment of the stanza in the ritual (Kauc. 59, ig) in a prayer addressed to Prajapati, for general prosperity. The connecting link between the stanza and Prajapati is obviously the word ka; cf. 'Contributions,' III, JAOS. XV, p. I84. Sayana: kihfabdena prajdpatir ucyate. There is positively no other tradition in reference to the stanza in the Atharvan literature, and it is safe to assume that the redactors of the Cauna- kiya-sainhita knew it only in its present ritualistic function, which is founded upon an obvious perversion of the text. This perversion may have been acccompanied by such changes in the text as would adapt it for the use in which it appears. We must hope that the stanza will appear in some other quarter and in some characteristic environment. No conclusive interpretation is possible as the matter stands at present. 4o9</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. yd evediz v9da ' he becomes possessed of the order of the sacrifice, fit for daksid. who thus knows.' It would clearly be useless, however, to trust to the direct definitions of daksiad in the ritual- istic texts and the commentators, in order to establish the original value of pirti, since the daksii?d may go as far as the sarvasvam 'one's all' (e. g. Kauc. 127. I2). The commentators 'take their mouth full' equally when they define the parti; the style of definition which Prof. Windisch has gathered (Festgruss, II7) is repeated very perfectly, e. g., by Sayana at AV. iii. 29. I istamz frutivihilam dgagddikarma, partamh smrlivihitaiz kiupaatatdkddi- nirmdnalaksanami karma; cf. also his definitions at AV. ii. I2. 4; iii. 12. 8; vi. 123. 2, etc. I believe that the Mantras reflect the original and more simple function which is indicated by the words purlam and purti, and that this is in accord with the etymology of these words them- selves. The root par (pr) means primarily 'to fill,' and that was probably the extent of the original daksind: the Brahmans were fed at the sacrifice with the odanam 'the porridge' which holds a characteristic place in these ceremonies throughout. The bestowal of gifts in general quickly took a place by the side of this primary and necessary reward. The root pac alone, or the root pac and dd together, occur as pendants to yaj in such a way as to stamp them as the more explicit form of statement, as a sort of commen- tary on the words pzrta and pirti. After the cooking comes the filling of the stomach, as is stated distinctly RV. x. 86. I4, uksno . . .canti... kuksta pfrnanti; cf. vii. 32. 8. At AV. vi. I42. 3 the prjLdntah 'the fillers' and the atiarah 'the eaters' are con- trasted. So then at AV. vi. 123. 4 the statement, sd pacdmi sd daddmi sdyaje, expands the idea contained in istdpzrtdm in st. 2 (cf. partdsya in st. 5); in AV. xii. 3. 47 we have ahdm? pacdmy ahdi daddmni in the sense of prn.dmi. The following statement in Gop. Br. ii. I. 5 presents this in more technical form: istz vd elena yad yajate 'iho vd elena puirtz ya odanalh pacyale. Still more formalized we have the same idea in sftra-form, Ap. (r. x. I4. 5-7, na darFapaurnamdsdbhydm yajale, na dadadi, na pacati, with which we may compare Ap. gr. iv. 9. 6, with purtam in the place of pacaii: svagz ma istamit svam datlariz svamh purtam; cf. also TB. iii. 7. 5. 4; (B. xiii. I. 5. 6. Thus the passage TS. i. 7. 3. 3, quoted by Prof. Windisch (ib. I 6), is placed in proper relief: yajnena vd istZ pakvena pzrtl. The Hindu grammarians regard pakvd as the perfect passive participle of the root pac, 4Io</page><page sequence="13">THE INTERPRETATION OF THE VEDA. and as far as the function of the word is concerned, their obser- vation holds good from the earliest period of the language; pakvd is equal to *paktd, and the pakv6h sc. odandh.(RV. viii. 77. 6) is the original pfirtam, the dakqind in its simplest form. Cf. the odandim pacydmdnam in RV. viii. 69. I4, and in general AV. iv. 34 3, 4; 35. I, 2,7; xi. I. I, 33, 37; xii. 3. 4, 5, I2, 27. As late, e. g., as Paragara-smrti xi. 47, 49 the sinfulness of not cooking for priests is animadverted upon. This homely present quickly swells out in the schemes of the priests into pdncdudand (AV. iv. I4. 7; ix. 5. 8, 37), fattudand (AV. x. 9. 4),1 and in the danastutis and the (ratuta-ritual the ingenuity of the Brahmans fairly exhausts itself in the variety and magnificence of the presents demanded, and reported to have been freely bestowed by liberal patrons in the past. Yet another word-namely, fraddhd-claims attention here, because it is definitely allied to the istadpfrtam. The word means primarily 'faith, religious faith,' e. g. RV. ii. I2. 5; or, more explicitly, AV. xi. 2. 28 ydh radddddhdti sdnti deva i{i 'he who believes the gods exist.' But Vedic India is nothing if not practical, and this abstract 'faith' is soon pointed towards 'works.' Hence the frequent juxtaposition of fraddhd on the one hand with yajina, or derivatives of the rootsyaj and liu (RV. x. I5I. I; v. 44. I6; vii. 6. 3; AV. x. 2. I9; 6. 4; xv. 7. 4, 5; Maitr. S. iv. 8. i [p. 107, 1. 7]; TS. vii. I. 8. 2; TB. iii. 2. 5. 9; Mundaka Up. i. 2. 2), on the other hand with daksisd and the root dd (RV. x. 15I. 2; AV. ix. 5. 7; xi. 8. 22; CB. xiv. 6. 9. 22= Brh. Ar. Up. iii. 9. 2i). In AV. xv. I6. 4 if. we have fraddhd correlated with yajna and daksind both. Thus the practical meaning of fraddhd is not so much abstract 'faith' as 'desire to perform holy work' ('opferwilligkeit'), which renders one yajnakdma and pirtikdma (i.stdfapura). In Gop. Br. i. i. 39 we have the full sequence that leads from fraddhd 'the faith that manifests itself in works' to the climax daksi.ad 'fee': raddhd, dzksd 'consecration for the sacrifice,' yajia 'sacrifice,' and daksind 'fee.' From this use of the word comes the derivative frdddha 'sacrifice to the manes.' It is this, not abstract faith, that induces Naciketas, when yet a child he is seized by fraddhd (talh ha kumdram sanam . . . fraddhd vivefa), to ask that he himself shall be given away as a sacrificial gift: TB. iii. I . 8. I; Katha Up. i. 2. As an illustra- tion of the manner in which this narrower construction of fradd/hd lyd4 Fatdudianadn pdcati ... prita hei asya rtv(ija sdrfve ... 41I</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. may be helpful in the interpretation of a Vedic passage, I would instance AV. v. 7. 5: yAmya'cdmy ahdh vaca sarasvalyd manojzijd fraddhaa tdm adyd vindalu data' somena babhrnad. Ludwig, Der Rigveda, III 306, renders: 'den (anteil, den) ich verlange mit der stimme der kriftigen (Sarasvati) der vom geiste angestrengten, den soll heute (raddha finden (betatigt) mit dem braunen Soma.' Grill, Hundert Lieder2, p. 40, renders: 'Wen ich angehe mit dem spruch, dem redefluss, gedankenvoll, der werd heut inne mein vertraun und nehm den braunen Soma hin.' And Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 272, note, takes fraddha ... daita somena babhrzun' in the sense 'courage that has been infused by the (exhilarating) brown soma.' All this is wide of the mark: the stanza cannot be understood without realizing that fraddlid here means the mental state which leads to prti, the bestowal of the daksind. The hymn v. 7 aims to appease the powers of avarice and grudge personified as Arati (a-rdii 'non-liberality'). In st. 5 the priest says: 'Him whom I implore with solemn speech (lit. with Vac Sarasvati, the goddess of speech), the yoke-fellow of thought, faith (that gains expression in daksina) shall overtake to-day, bestowed by the brown soma.' The sacrificer, inspired and made cheerful by the soma,' shall, when approached by the suppliant priest, be liberal in his gifts. This is the plain sense.2 In this way the epithet afraddhd 'devoid of fraddhd,' used of the Panis, RV. vii. 6. 3, amounts in the end to their characteristic designation, 'stingy.' III.-ON THE d7T. XEy. rujandla, RV. i. 32. 6, WITH A NOTE ON HAPLOLOGY AND HAPLOGRAPHY.3 The hymn containing the word rujfanah is one of the most prominent of the large class which describe the conflict of Indra and the demon of the cloud, Vrtra. The passage in question, RV. i. 32. 6 c, d, reads: 1Cf. RV. ix. 113.4. 2 Cf. Sacred Books, XLII 424, which contains the germ of these remarks on fraddha. While correcting this proof I was gladdened by a reprint of Prof. Oldenberg's 'Vedische Untersuchungen,' ZDMG. L 423 ff., which contain a similar exposition of fraddhd (p. 448 ff.). The almost self-evident truth of these observations needs no securer voucher. 3 An abstract of this paper was printed in the Proc. Amer. Or. Soc., April, I893 (Journal, vol. XVI, pp. xxxii ff.). 412</page><page sequence="15">THE INTERPRETATION OF THE VEDA. nai 'ldrid asya sdmrtii? vadhandam sdmh rujanadh ipis.a indrafatruh. '(Vrtra) has not survived the blow of his (Indra's) weapons,' etc. The fourth pada is rendered by Grassmann: 'im Sturz zerbrach der Indrafeind die Kliifte'; Ludwig translates: 'die gebrochenen burgen zermalmte er (selber noch im sturze) des feind gott Indra.' Both translators ignore the native treatment of the word. In Yaska's Naighantuka i. 13 = Kautsavaya 30,1 it occurs in a list of words for 'river,' and in Yaska's Nirukta vi. 4 we have, more explicitly, rujdnd nadyo bhavanti rujanti kaldni2 'the rujdndla are rivers; they break (ruj) the banks.' This purely etymo- logical rendering is adopted by Sayana: indrena halo nadisu patitah san ... vrtradehasya pdtena nadzndm kuldni tatratyapd- qdnddikami curnzbhatam. Even at the time of the present arrangement of the ndighantuka there must have been some perplexity, for the word occurs a second time in Naigh. iv. 3, in one of those lists which even in Yaska's time stood in need of especial elucidation. And Madhava, in explaining the parallel passage at TB. ii. 5. 4. 4, renders quite differently: bhangaiz prdpnuvanfzh svakZyd eva sendh . .. vajre.na halo bhamdu patan san sarmzpavarlinah sarvdn furdn curnzkrtavdn 'his own armies while they are perishing, all the heroes standing near, (Vrtra) slain by the bolt, falling upon the ground, has ground to pieces'; here rujanadh is explained by bhangamh prdpnuvantz.. .. sendh, in a manner totally different from the Nirukta. But all these translations are certainly incorrect, because they make rujanadh an accusative dependent upon sdrh pipiqe, which is thus forced to assume the function of a middle with active value. Every occur- rence of the word in the Rig-Veda and the Atharva-Veda, and, so far as is known, every Vedic occurrence of the word, goes to show that the middle does not occur with active value; only the active occurs; see especially Grassmann's Lexicon and Whitney's Index Verborum. Thus sdr piiiisa indrafatruh cannot mean anything else but 'he who had Indra as his enemy was crushed.' This grammatical consideration is supported to perfection by the facts otherwise known in the case: Vrtra never crushes anything; on the other hand, sdm pis is used especially of Indra, and most 1 See the writer in Proc. Amer. Or. Soc., October, I890 (Journal, vol. XV, p. xlviii). 2 Cf. under Panini ii. 3. 54 nadi kaldni rujali. 413</page><page sequence="16">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. frequently when he crushes cloud-demons; e. g. RV. iii. I8. 9 firo dasasya sdqh pinak; iii. 30. 8 ahastdm indra sdm piinak kizndrum; iv. 30. I3 piro ydd asya (sc. flszi.asya) samhpi.nak; vi. 17. Ioygna navanlam dhimh sariziniak; viii. I. 28 tviAm pdram . . . fiiqasya s6m piinak. One may say that but for the presence of rujanah in the pada, no one would have ever thought of regarding s6am ipiqe as an active. We are thus constrained to search in rujanadh for a nom. sg. in agreement with the subject of the sentence. Another point strongly claims recognition. The root ruj, simple as well as with various prepositions, figures very promi- nently in descriptions of the injuries which Indra inflicts upon demons, and it seems very natural to suppose that the word rujanadh here states that such injury was inflicted upon Vrtra by Indra. Thus RV. x. 89. 6, 7 (indrah) frnti v.duzi rujdti sthirini ... jaghaina vrtrdhi ... ruroja pufrah; cf. also i. 6. 5; 5I. 5; iv. 32. IO; vi. 32. 3; ix. 48. 2. Very similar are RV. viii. 6. 13 vi vryrdmz parvafo rujian; i. 59. 6 vi vrtrsya ... .pa.sy 'rujah; x. 152.3 = AV. i. 21. 3 = SV. ii. 1217; also TS. i. 6. 2. 5 vi vrtrdsya hdnu ruja. Elsewhere Vala is treated in the same way; e. g. RV. iv. 5. 5 valaih ruroja; RV. vi. 39. 2 rujd ... vi vdlasya sanum; AV. xix. 28. 3 hrddh safiptndndmh bhindhi 'ndra iva virujdn valdm . At RV. x. 49. 6 sdm . . . dasaTh vrtraha 'rujam, and AV. iv. 24. 2 yd (sc. indro) ddnava'ndg bdlam drur&lt;ja, the same theme is treated. At RV. vi. 22. 6 the words rzjo vi drdha express essentially the same thing, the cleaving of the clouds; cf. also vii. 75. 7; viii. 45. 13; ix. 34. i. At RV. vi. 32. 2 we have rujad ddrim (cf. i. 72. 2); at RV. vi. 6I. 2 arujal sainu giriznam. Again, of Indra it is said, RV. x. 84. 3 rujdn. . .atran; RV. i. I02. 4 = AV. vii. 50. 4 pri fdltrndfa maghzavan vrsnyd ruja. Every additional example strengthens the impression that rujianah originally stood in agreement with indrafatruh, the subject of the sentence, and we are at once led to the emendation rujdnadh 'broken' in the sense of a passive; cf. Delbriick, Altindische Syntax, p. 264. But why should the correctly accented and easily intelligible rujdndh have given way to this discordant lectio difficillima with anomalous accent? The sense, too, is tauto- logical in the extreme: 'Vrtra having been broken was crushed.' The root ruj is employed very frequently in connection with parts of the body. Thus we have above the expressions vi vrtrdsya hdnz ruja; vi vrtrirh parvafo rujc,n; rzijad... vi 414</page><page sequence="17">THE INTERPRETATION OF THE VEDA. vdlasya sa'num. In a different connection we have AV. ix. 8. 13, figuratively, yah simanarz virujdnti murdhanam prmly arqanih 'the pains which break the crown of the head and the head'; AV. ix. 8. i8 ya'h ... frarnsii virujdnti; (B. iv. 5. 2. 3 virujya fronm. At Ram. iii. 72. 20 we have paksatundanakhdih.. gdarday drujatd; at Har. 5694 standn drujya. With this use are related the very common expressions like mukha-rzj 'pain in the mouth,' Varah. Br. S. 5. 82; drg-ruj, ibid. 104. 5; aksi-ruj, ibid. 51. II; I04. I6; netra-ruj, AK. iii. 4. 26. 203, 'pain in the eyes'; pdrrva-ruj, Sugruta i. I65. 9, 'pain in the side'; laldte ca rujd jajne, Ram. iii. 29. 15; firo-ruj, Varah. Brh. S. 53. III; firo- rujd, Mahabh. iii. 16829; firaso rujd, ibid. I6816. My suggestion, now, is that rujjanah is a compound of a deriv- ative of the root ruj with some designation of a part of the body. It might be = rujdnd+t as 'having a broken mouth'; but it seems even more likely to be rujdnd+nds 'nose.' This would yield *rujdnands, changed by dissimilation (haplology) to rujafnds.1 The word would then mean 'with broken nose.' In stanza 7 of the same hymn the statement is made that Vrtra was broken into many small pieces: purutrta vrtrd afayad vyastah; which augurs that his nose was not spared in the general catastrophe. Humor- ous (to our feeling) descriptions of Vrtra's discomfiture abound in the Brahmanas. Thus the Maitr. S. iv. 7. 4 (p. 97, 1. I8), using this very verb ruj, says: indro vdi vrtram ahahs tasya yan mirdhzanam udarujat sa dronakalafo 'bhavat 'Indra slew Vrtra; when he broke open his head that became a soma-bucket.' Cf. the variant of this story, TS. vi. 5. 9. I, and see ?B. i. 6. 3. i6. The falling away of Vrtra's eye-ball is another instance of the attention that is paid to Vrtra's separate remains after he has been dispatched by Indra (see above, p. 406). This explanation, at any rate, yields good sense, and accounts for the anomalous (bahuvrihi) accentuation of rujands. The stem nds 'nose' does not occur out of composition, but it seems to be fairly certain in anas, RV. v. 29. Io: anaso ddsyiir am.no vadhgna. The padapatha divides an-aso, and both the Petersburg lexicons and Grassmann follow, translating the word by 'without face or mouth.' Ludwig, Der Rig-Veda, II o09, translates 'with 1See the note on haplology at the end of this article.

Cf. also his remarks in the notes, vol. V, p. 95. The same interpretation was advanced previously by Max Miiller: see Ad. Kuhn, Die Herabkunft des Feuers, p. 59, note. Especially on the second assumption (rujandh = rujd- ndndh) it is easy to understand how the composite character of the word might have been forgotten, and the earliest interpreters driven to propositions entirely out of accord with the rest of the sentence and with reasonable sense. Note on Hafilology and Haplography. Cases of haplology are by no means so rare in the older language as would appear from the very few instances that are usually reported. Whitney, Sk. Gr.2, ?Io2I b, mentions irddlhyai for *iradh-ddhydi, and this is the sole example in illustration of the process mentioned by Brugmann, Grundriss, I 484. Other examples, in addition to ulokei for *ulu-loka from uru-loka (see the next article), are: madilgha 'sweet-wood, licorice' for *madhu-dugha, *madhugha, with loss of aspiration, both inter- mediate forms being found occasionally in the MSS; see e. g. Kau9. 35. 2I, note 9; .rcd and trica for */ry-rca 'a group of three stanzas' (so already Yaska, Nir. iii. i); hirainmaya for *hiranya-maya 'golden,' where the loss of the firstya by dissim- ilation operates across the syllable ma'; fusmayd for *Fusma- maya, TS. ii. 2. I2. 4, 'fiery,' which the Petersburg lexicon erro- neously regards as the corruption of a theoretical *Fusmya; fgvrdha for *?eva-vrdha 'kindly, friendly' (Grassmann); sddas- pd/i for *saidasaspdti 'protector of home': compounds with pdti having two accents regularly exhibit a genitive as the first member: fubhds-pdfi, br'has-pdti, brdhmanas-ptai, and by imita- tion vdnas-pdli, ja's-pd/i, rdthas-pdti; ?irsak/i 'headache' may stand for firsa-sak/i 'affection of the head' from root sac in the sense of 'fasten upon'; cf. AV. i. I2. 3, where ?girsakti and sac occur together alliteratively. The last example is by no means certain. There is correlation, surely, between this phenomenon and the gliding over of causatives like ksaayaydmi, etc., to the p-type: ksapaydmi, etc.; cf. also the change of rohdydmi of the Mantras to ropdydmi in the Brahmanas. 1The establishment thus of a quasi-stem hiran- has produced the secondary adjective stems, also meaning 'golden,' hiranz'n and hiranvatz; see Wacker- nagel, Altindische Grammatik, vol. I, p. 280. 4I6</page><page sequence="19">THE INTERPRETATION OF THE VEDA. Since the above was written Sanskrit grammar has been permanently enriched by the publication of the first volume of Wackernagel's substantial and scholarly Altindische Grammatik. In ?24I (pp. 278-80) the present subject is dealt with, and closely related phenomena are discussed also in ?53 (p. 59). Wacker- nagel adds a number of examples to those given above, not all of which, from the nature of the subject, are equally secure. Espe- cially the derivation of apiiva 'participation' from api-pi(vdl needs to be canceled. There is no suffix -pitvd: the words ending in this way are compounds of pith 'food,' and are restricted to the metrical language, which does not exhibit apiiva at all; see Journ. Amer. Or. Soc.

The formation of api-tvd is illustrated by tat-tva 'thus-ness': it is an abstract from api 'too,' meaning 'too-ness' (participation); cf. expressions like nd tdsya vdcy dpi bhdgo asti, RV. x. 71. 6; astv eva me 'pi prasute bhdgah, (B. iv.

IV.-THE MEANING AND ETYMOLOGY OF uloki.a The various essays on this expression are instructive alike for the keen philological insight and the inadequate grammatical propositions of their authors. The expression is distinctively an archaism in the literature. In the first eight mandalas of the RV. the word lokd occurs only twice without the u preceding: vi. 47. 8; viii. 100. I2.4 With antecedent u the occurrences are i. 93. 6; ii. 30. 6; iii. 2. 9; 29. 8; 37. II; iv. I7. I7; v. I. 6; 4. I ; vi. 23. Neither bhrjvan nor bhurijvan are mentioned in the lexicons. 2 I would warn philologists not thoroughly acquainted with the Vedic language against copying Grassmann's statement in his lexicon, p. I415&amp;, that aFifnat, RV. vii. 28. 3, stands for aficnathat: the form is a regular reduplicated root-aorist; see Whitney, Sk. Gr.2, ?867. I see also no sufficient reason for regarding the form isanta, RV. i. I34. 5, as an abbreviation of isananta, since the stem isa- is well authenticated: the occurrence of the form isananta in the same verse renders it likely that the use of the two stems is intentional; cf. Ludwig, Der Rig-Veda, V 269, 64I. :An abstract of this paper was printed in the Proc. Amer. Or. Soc., April, I893 (Journal, vol. XVI, pp. xxxv ff.). 4Correct, accordingly, Bollensen in ZDMG.

In the ninth book there are two occurrences of simple lokd, ix. II3. 7, 9; and three of u loka, ix. 2. 8 (u loka- krtnum); 86. 21 (u lokakr'l); 92. 5 (u lokdm). In the tenth book there are six occurrences of u lokd: x. 13. 2; I6. 4; 30. 7; I04. IO; I33. I (u lokakr't); i80. 3; and three occurrences of simple lokd: x. x4. 9; 85. 27; 90. I4. In addition the tenth book, and that alone, begins to produce compounds in which lokd is the final member: urullokam, in x. 128. 2; jivalokdm, in x. i8. 8; and patilokdm, in x. 85. 43. This shows, on the whole, a perceptible growth of lokd at the expense ofu lokd in the ninth and tenth books; and the AV. continues boldly in the same direction. Here lokd occurs so often as to render a count useless, but u lokd occurs only three times, in one hymn of the Yama- book, xviii. 4. II, 44, 71, in the obviously archaizing phrase sukr'tfm u lokdm. I do not count three other occurrences which coincide with the RV.-namely, vii. 84. 2 = RV. x. i80. 3; xviii. 2. 8 = RV. x. i6. 4; xviii. 3. 38 = RV. x. 13. 2. The AV. abounds also in compounds in which loka forms the second member; see Index Verborum, p. 257a. In the Yajus-texts, both u lokd and lokd occur; but we have no means of controlling their frequency or proportion. We have surabha u lokd in VS. xii. 35 = TS. iv. 2. 3. 2 = MS. ii. 7. Io; ?B. vi. 8. 2. 31; sukr'fdm u lokdm in VS. xviii. 52 = TS. iv. 7. 13. I = MS. ii. 12. 3; and in VS. xviii. 58; (B. ix. 5. i. 45; svam u lokam, Tait. Ar. vi. 5. I. The parallel of VS. xviii. 58 in TS. v. 7. 7. I has sukr'tasya lokdm instead of sukr'idm u lokdm. That is precisely the favorite manner in which the AV. manages to circumvent the archaism; see e. g. iv. I. 6; 14. 6; vi. II9. I; 120. I; 121. I, 2; vii. 83. 4; xi. i. 8, 37, etc. In VS. xi. 22 = MS. ii. 7. 2 occurs the pada dkah su lokdri szikrtaimi prthivyam, which is varied in TS. iv. I. 2. 4 to dkah sd lokdmi su'krtamz prthivyah. Both sz and sd are modern variants of u; and they testify that the combination u lokd had become perplexing. It is to be noted also that the compound lokakr'l, which is preceded by u in the two sole occur- rences in the RV. (ix. 86. 2I; x. I33. I), occurs in other texts always without u: AV. xviii. 3. 25; TS. i. I. 12. I; TB. iii. 7. 2. Io; Agv. gr. iv. 13. 5. Most Vedic scholars have recognized the unusual character of u before loka. In many cases it makes no sense; and in RV. iii. 1 The same expression occurs in RV. v. I. 6. 419</page><page sequence="22">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. 2. 9; 37. II; V. 4. II; viii. I5. 4; ix. 2. 8 it stands at the begin- ning of a pada, in defiance of the rule that enclitics cannot stand at the beginning of any verse-line.' There is no connection from which u lokd, regarded as two words, could have propagated secondarily2; hence all the interpreters have agreed to assume ulokd as a single word, misunderstood by the padapatha and the Pratigakhya of the RV., owing to the occurrence of loka in the same text. Adalbert Kuhn, Indische Studien, I 350 ff., after comparing lokd with Lith. and Old Pruss. laukas, Lettish lauko, all meaning 'open space, field,' Low Germ. louch, loch 'village,' derives the word from Sk. urd, evpv-s, and sees in the u a trace of the fuller form of the stem, which was lost for reasons not stated. Roth, in his Erliauterungen zum Nirukta, p. 34, thinks that u of ulokd may be the rest of the preposition ud (ul-lokd). The Pet. Lex. suggests that the word is a derivative from the root ruc 'shine,' preceded by a preposition u, a reduced form of ava. Bollensen, ZDMG. XVIII 607 ff., XXII 580, derives it from an adjective *urv-anc, through the weak stem *urvac, extended into an a-stem *urvaka, *uroka. Ascoli, Corsi di Glottologia, p. 236 (German translation, p. I95); Fick, Vergleichendes Worterbuch (all edi- tions: fourth, vol. I, p. 122), and Joh. Schmidt, Vocalismus, II 220, assume a phonetic development of u out of the initial /. Grassmann modifies the view of the Pet. Lex. by supposing a reduplicated stem *ruroka which lost the r of the reduplicating syllable. Finally Aufrecht, ZDMG. XLII I52, assumes that ulokd is reduced from uru-lokd. The germ of what seems to us the true explanation is contained in Kuhn's and Aufrecht's views: there is some connection between ulokd and the word uru. The following statements and conclusions were written out without a knowledge of Aufrecht's brief note, and the independent arrival of both of us at the same result may impart an element of security to the construction. We may assume the simple stem lokd, and a descriptive com- 1Hence the Rigveda-Praticakhya (978), which, like the padapatha, regards u in these cases as the particle, is led to insert a special provision exempting u from the law of enclitics: anuddttam tu pddddu novarjaih vidyatepadam 'no unaccented word is found at the beginning of a pada except u.' 2A somewhat mechanical propagation of the particle u must be assumed for its persistent occurrence after infinitives in -tavii (-tavi u), and the double accent of these infinitives seems to be due to the increment produced by this enclisis. 420</page><page sequence="23">THE INTERPRETATION OF THE VEDA. pound urulokd, changed by assimilation of the linguals to *ulu- lokdl and by haplology to ulokd. Naturally, after the loss of one of the syllables, the origin of the word was forgotten, and the padakara, perplexed by the existence of the simple word lokd, construed u as the particle. The Vedic poets themselves had lost all knowledge of the composite character of the word; but the expression ulokd clearly betrays its elective affinity for the word uru, which frequently occurs as its predicate; e. g. RV. i. 93. 6; vi. 23. 7; vii. 33. 5; 6o. 9; 84. 2; 99. 4; x. I8o. 3. The case is therefore one of the unconscious doubling of equivalent linguistic elements; the first uru having been exhausted by its phonetic fate, a second uru is put into requisition; its fitness as a predicate of lokd (ulokd) has not passed by.2 But there appears to be a certain shyness in putting uruz near ulokd; in all cases where the two occur together, urz stands at the beginning and ulokd at the end of the pada; e. g. i. 93. 6 urdrhyajinya cakrathur u lokdm. So also vi. 23. 7; vii. 35.5; 60. 9; 84. 2; 99.4; x. I80. 3. The occurrence of the dar. Xqy. uruloka in RV. x. I28. 2 = AV. v. 3. 3 = TS. iv. 7. I4. I, does not stand in the way of the assumed phonetic process. In the first place, the word occurs in the tenth book, and we may assume that the phonetic law had ceased to operate. Further, the cases are not the same: *urulokd changed to ulokd is a karmadharaya, and accordingly oxytone; urziloka is a bahuvrihi in both function and accentuation. It is quite likely that the identical grave intonation of the two similar first syllables in urulokd favored a process of dissimilation uncalled for by the two initial syllables of uru'lokam, contrasted as they were by accent and perhaps also by syllabification (ur-ul-o- kd, but u-ru-lo-ka). But there seems to be also a chronological difference; since the AV., though it does not directly compound urv and lokd, places them closely together, e. g. ix. 2. I urzim lokdm akaram mdhyam edhatazm; xii. I. I urmrh lokdm prthivf nah krnotu; see also xiv. I. 58; xviii. 2. 20.

V.-ON THE GROUP OF VEDIC WORDS ENDING IN -gva AND -gvin, WITH NOTES ON vziu, is-kar AND adhrigu.l In 1852 Professor Roth, in his note on Nirukta xi. 9 (p. I49), said somewhat as follows: " The suffix -gva is to be found outside of navagva and its correspondent dafagva only in etagva and atithigva. An extension of it seems to be -gvin in atagvin. If we look for a unity of meaning for the suffix in all these forma- tions, we must assume for it, as well as for the related suffix -gu, which occurs in a considerable number of compounds, a broad meaning, something like 'having the kind, form, number of.'" And firther, "navagva und dafagva konnte die 'Neuner, Zehner,' d. h. die Glieder einer soviele Theile zahlenden Gemeinschaft, etagva ein buntgearteter, fatagvin hundertfach sein." The suggestion of a similar view may be found also in Benfey's glossary to the Sama-Veda, s. v. etagva and navagva. Ludwig's translations are along the same line; see, for instance, RV. i. i59. 5 (I7I); viii. 45. ii (603). Grassmann in his concordance essays to lend etymological support to this kind of construction by assuming a stem -gva 'coming,' from a root gvd 'to come,' an 'older' form of the root gd, having in mind doubtless the labio- velar forms of the root in Oaivo, venio, etc.'; cf. his somewhat similar misconception of the interrogative stem ku (s. v.). It is good at times to listen attentively to the protests of phonetic experience. Why should the u-element of the I.E. root g*d loom up in Sanskrit in this rather obscure set of words, being lost in the verbal forms, and in all other roots which contain a labio- velar media? It is, however, not worth while to discuss subtle phonological questions in this connection, since a correct philo- logical interpretation of these suffixes obviates the necessity of 1First read before the Johns Hopkins Philological Association, March I7, I893; see Johns Hopkins University Circulars, vol.

The stems are -gv-a and -gv-in; and gu is the well-known weakest stem-form of go 'cow.' The word Fata-gv-in speaks most plainly; it means 'possessing, or consisting of, a hundred cows,' and one needs but to present the five passages in which the word occurs to put the question as a whole upon a firm basis: RV. i. I59. 5 'To us, O heaven and earth, give wealth rich in goods, containing a hundred cattle (fatagvinam)' ; iv. 49. 4 rayirh fatagvinam dfvdvantarh sahas- rinam. And again: viii. 45. I 'going easily, O thou to whom belongs the press-stone (Indra), rich in horses, having a hundred cows' (dfvdvantah ?atagvinah); ix. 65. 17 Fatagviznar gdvdnz posamh svdfzyam; ix. 67. 6 fatagvinauz rayi'h gdmantam afvinam; cf. in general RV. ix. 62. I2. The word fafa-gv-in does not differ in structure fundamentally from sapjd-gu in RV. x. 47. 6 prd saptdgum . . . br.haspdlimz matir dchd jigdti yd dingiraso... asmdbhya7ih citrdmT vrsanamh rayirm dah 'our prayer goes forth to Brhaspati, the Afigiras, who gives (or obtains) seven cows,2 who shall furnish us varied powerful wealth.' The words saptdgu and rayim in the relation of cause and effect are obviously parallel to fatagvinam and rayim. And in Gaut. Dharmac. xviii. 26, 27; Manu xi. 14; Mahabh. xiii. 3742, fatagu and sahasragu are later representatives of such formation; cf. also ekagu, Vait. Su. 24. 20. But the additional suffix -in (fata-gv-in) does impart to the word a more general adjectival value, rendered with difficulty in English by 'hundred-cow-like'; and, at any rate, the word is on the road to a meaning like 1 Here Sayana, with complete insight, fatasarhkhyakagavddivifistam. 2Ludwig's translation of saptdgu as a proper name hangs by the slender thread of the tradition of the Sarvanukramani, which ascribes the hymn to Saptagu Angirasa (cf. also Sadguruyisya, p. I52). Grassmann translates: "Zum Brhaspati der fahrt mit sieben Rindern." But Brhaspati- does not anywhere ride with seven cattle, as may be gathered negatively from Naigh. i. I5, where the teams of the gods are grouped together and Brhaspati's is described as vifvarzijah. Brhaspati Ailgirasa is designated as saptdgu because he and the Angirases obtain the mythical cows. So RV. i. 62. 3 zndrasyd 'igirasdah ce 'stiu . . . bhaspatir bhindd ddrimT viddd gi. 'At the wish of Indra and the Angirases Brhaspati cleft the rock and obtained the cattle.' Cf. also ii. 23. r8; x. Io8. 6, 8, IO, ii; and in general x. 67. In Taitt. Ar. iii. 9. I; Vait. Su. I5. 3; Gop. Br. ii. 2. 9; Ap. Cr. xi. 3. 14 we have the statement that dhend is the wife of Brhaspati (dhend brhaspateh patna); and this conception also is founded upon the myth which makes Indra, or Brhaspati, liberate the cows (RV. iii.. 34 3; x. 43. 6). 423</page><page sequence="26">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. 'hundredfold' even in RV. ix. 65. 17 fatagvinam rayimiz gomantam, where ?atagvinam is sufficiently faded and generalized to admit of the additional gomantam. This is therefore not precisely tautological; the expression as it stands is to be rendered 'hun- dredfold wealth abounding in cattle.' And so the poet finds it possible in RV. viii. I. 9 to address Indra thus: y~ le sdn/i dafa- gvinah fatino y sahasrinah... ' with thy horses in tens, hundreds and thousands !' The proper name atithigvd has, so far as is known, never been translated. Grassmann's -gva 'going' does not yield appreciable sense. If we analyze structurally a/ithi-gv-d 'he who has or offers a cow for the guest,' 'he who is hospitable,' we have a normal compound, normal sense, and a valuable glimpse of Vedic house-practices, known hitherto only in the Brahmanas and Satras. At the argkya-ceremony, which is performed on the arrival of an honored guest, the 'preparation' of a cow is the central feature. The technical expression is gdah kurute; see fankh. Gr. ii. 15. I; A9v. Gr. i. 24. 30, 31; Par. i. 3. 26, 30; Gobh. iv. io. I; Ap. Gr. v. 13. 15; Hir. Gr. i. I3. Io; Apast. Dh. ii. 4. 8. 5. In TS. vi. i. o1. i the ceremony goes by the name go-argha. There is no reason why this simple and natural practice should not be reflected by the hymns, and it comports with the character of Atithigva as a generous giver; cf. atilhigvd- sya radhaah in vi: 47. 22; ahdnt (sc. indro) gunigibhyo atithigvdm iskaram iqamh nd vrtratu'ramh viksg dhdrayam in x. 48. 8; divodd- sdya ddf?dse atithigvaya in i. I30. 7. Cf. also similar statements in reference to descendants of Atithigva (adithigvd) in viii. 68. i6, I7. The adjective ai/thin is a ar7. Xey. in RV. x. 68. 3; it occurs 1The Homeric bahuvrihi compounds reaaapd-fo(F)-tco 'worth four steers,' and similarly evved-, dodeKcd-, eltKoad-, 'Kar6oi-0otor, suggest, along with the Vedic words, that the I.E. word gou- was a prominent unit of count. The weak stem gu at the end of a possessive compound appears in sKar6upfi, which almost reflects a possible Vedic *fata-gv-d 'a body of hundred cows or steers.' EKar6lup7l has undergone a somewhat similar fate with ?atagvin; it means originally 'a sacrifice of a hundred steers,' but the meaning of its component parts must have been thoroughly lost sight of before Peleus, II. xxiii. 146, could promise a hecatomb of fifty rams; cf. also the rai,vpv re Kat dpvetLv eKaTr6f,pj, Od. i. 25, and the /car6o /3 ravipov ;76' aiyov, II. i. 3i5. In a different way the meaning has faded out of pov- in 3ovK6ocg, so as to enable it to appear in the compound iirtropOVK06Xo0 'horse-herd.' Another type and use of numerals in composition with the stem gou is exhibited in the Phrygian proper name OKcraydS (cf. saptdgu, and navagvd, dafagvd, below); see Bezz. Beitr. X 196; Indog. Anzeig. II I5. 424</page><page sequence="27">THE INTERPRETA TION OF THE VEDA. in the expression atithinzr gaih; and, whatever it may mean, it suggests forcibly the proper name in question. The rendering of atithin by 'wandering,' as given by the Petersburg lexicons and Grassmann, is based upon the supposed etymology (root at 'wander'), and reflects the vagueness usual with such interpreta- tions. Ludwig's translation (972): 'wie gaste kommend,' is a compromise between the etymology and the ordinary meaning of dtithi. The passage in question reads: sddhvarya atithinir isirra spdrhath suvdrnd anavadydrapdah, brhaspatih pdrvatebhyo viturya nir gia upeydvam iva sthivibhyah 'Brhaspati has divided out like barley from bushels the (rain-)cows, propitious to the pious,' fit for guests, strong, desirable, beautiful in color, faultless in form, after having conquered them from the clouds.' The proper name atithi-gv-d means therefore precisely one who has or offers atithinzr ga'h, 'cows fit for guests.' It seems scarcely possible to hesitate, after these considerations, when we come to analyze the words ndvagva and ddfagva. Whatever their precise meaning, they also are bahuvrihi com- pounds, containing the stem gu- 'cow,' as was foreshadowed by Bergaigne, La Religion V6dique, II 145. The proof may be rendered on the severest technical grounds. As the outflow of Indra's supreme power to obtain the cows (waters) from the mountains (clouds), the same capacity appears delegated to Brhaspati, frequently with the qualifying attribute Anigiras or Anigirasa; next, to the Angirases themselves; further, to the Navagvas and DaGagvas, who are also frequently designated as Angiras; and finally, to Sarama in the specific character as a messenger of Indra. Brhaspati Aiigirasa is designated as saptdgu in x. 46. 7; in ii. 23. i8 we have gdvdia gotrdm uddsrjo ydd angirah ... brhaspate (cf. gotrabhid in st. 3). Indra, the Aiigiras, Brhaspati and Sarama appear in the same exploit in i. 62. 3; cf. in general the hymns x. 67 and io8. It is worth while to group together the statements of this sort which concern the Navagvas and Dagagvas: RV. x. 62. 6, 7 ndvagvo ni ddfagvo dngira- samo ... indrena yujf' nih s.jana. . . vrajdmh go'm an am; v. 1 sddhvaryd, rendered by the padapatha into sadhu-aryfih, a ar. ?;ey. I have found it difficult to suppress the belief that the word originally was sd ddhvaryS, contracted metrically into sddhvaryfih, sd referring to b.rhaspdti.h and adhvarydih meaning' fit for the sacrifice.' Since adhvaryi, according to this division, is likewise a arm. Zey., it may have embarrassed the padakara sufficiently to have led him to the division into sadhu and arya. 425</page><page sequence="28">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. 29. 12 ndvagvdsah sutdsomdsa indragm ddfagvdso abhy arcanty arkaih, gd vyarm cid arvdm .. . ndra.h . . .pa vran; v. 45. 7 dnunod dtra hdsfayato ddrir arcan yena ddfa maso n dva- gv ah, rtdMz yati sardmd g a avindad vifvdni satya 'ngirdf cakdra 'the press-stone here, using which the Navagvas gave praise for ten months, sounded strongly.

In these passages the poet, at any rate, must be conscious of a relation between the element -gva and the stem go or its derivatives. Without entering here upon a complete dis- cussion of all the mythological ideas involved (cf. Bergaigne, La Religion v6dique, II 307 ff.), it seems to me that we must choose one of two interpretations of -gvd in these two names. Either the Navagvas and Dayagvas are heavenly assistants of Indra or Brhaspati who distinguished themselves in these exploits by obtaining or freeing nine or ten of the cloud-cows; or, like the Angiras, they are mythical sacrificers2 who, by giving nine or ten cows, strengthen Indra or Brhaspati in his attacks upon the cloud- cows. In fact, the name seems to carry a changeable force, involving both aspects, just as the epithet saptdgu, applied to Brhaspati in x. 47. 6, clearly implies his participation in the heavenly exploit, and at the same time the generous bestowal of cattle upon the reverent sacrificer who praises him with songs. But even a future modification of this view cannot impair the fundamental fact that these words are possessive compounds with stem gu- as their second members. The ending -gva occurs in one other word, gtagva. Grass- mann, under the coercion of his theory that gva = gd 'go,' trans- lates it by "coming quickly, hurrying"; the Petersburg lexicons 'Cf. Ludwig's translation (997). 2See especially RV. ii. 34. I2; AV. xviii. 3. 20. In AV. xiv. I. 56 the ndvagva seem even to have reduced themselves to earthly sacrificers, or to earthly bestowers of cows: sdkhibhir ndvagvaih seems to mean secondarily (cf. RV. iii. 39. 5 for its primary value) 'with friends that bring nine cows as a present.' But the Atharvan stanza smacks of adaptation; it seems to have been primarily a brahmodya dealing with Usas (ydsd). 426</page><page sequence="29">THE INTERPRETATION OF THE VEDA. by "bunt schimmernd"; Ludwig at i. 115. 3 (128) by "schil- lernd," but at vii. 70. 2 (54) and viii. 59. 7 (613) by the proper name Etagva, a makeshift clearly indicative of embarrassment. Sayana's comments, especially at i. I115. 3, do not present any- thing tenable so far as -gva is concerned. The interpretation of -gva becomes simple enough if we follow the lead of the other words of the group; it contains the stem gu 'cow' in the sense of 'ray'; gtagva means 'having bright rays,' and so 'shining brightly.' In v. 80. 2-4 Usas is spoken of as follows: brhadrathi ... esa gdbhir aruznbhir yujdnd . . . vy? e bhavati; the cows can scarcely refer to anything but rays, or sheets of light. The two words gdbhir and vyeni contain the stems which enter into the composition of Uta-gv-a. The identification of the bright streaks of light at dawn with cows yoked, to the chariot of Aurora is even clearer at i. 92. 2 zd apaptann aruna bhdndvo vrlhd svdytljo ga ayuksata; at i. 124.

Hence Usas is spoken of in v. 64. 7 as ruzifad-go (uchdntydm ... rzifadgavi), a bahuvrihi like Egagva; cf. her epithets ruiatpa gu in v. 75. 9 and rzi?advatsd in i.

II5. 3, reads thus: bhadra' dfvd harifah suryasya cirai 9eagvd anumaldydsah. The harita7. are defined by the commentator at Naigh. i. 15 (Bibl. Ind.) as harilavar.d rafmayah prdtar ddityasya; and by Yaska, Nir. iv. I, as ddityasya rafmayah. The expression haritah suryasya gtagvah means therefore primarily 'the steeds of the sun consisting of bright rays.'

In conclusion a few brief remarks, suggested by the preceding investigation: Another case of a word misunderstood as a suffix is contained in visnzu, the designation of the god.

I would propose to analyze it as vi-stu 'crossing the back (of the world, or the earthly regions).' The constant use of the root kram with the preposition vi suggests the first part of the compound vi-snzu; the second part is illus- trated by RV. v. 87. 4 (ddhi snzzbhi.h), and more clearly by SV. ii. Io24ydio visniur vi cakrame prt hivya ddhi sanavi (= RV. i. 22. I6 with variant, prthivyalh. saptd dhaSmabhih). Here the words vi and sanavi furnish the equipment for the naming of the sun-god, whose designation by an epithet is paralleled by sdvitar: each term turns out a specific phase of the sun's activity, which quickly crystallizes into an independent proper name. Note on is-kar. Conversely, a misunderstanding has given rise to a prefix i.s2 with the root kar (and with no other root) in the sense of 'prepare, equip.' It is important, in the first place, to disabuse one's mind from the suspicion that this prefix is in any way connected with the noun is 'food, nourishment.' This word occurs in inflected forms with the verb kar 'prepare'; so e. g. the acc. plur. in the expression, RV. iii. 62. 14, sdmo asmdbhyam . .. isas karat'Soma shall prepare food for us'; cf. also RV. ix. I5. 7. The root kar with prefix is, on the other hand, itself governs the accusative; e. g. RV. x. 53. 7 iskrn.zudhvam rafana.h 'prepare the harness'; or RV. x. 48. 8 ahdiz gungiibhyo atitli- gvdm iskaram 'I have made ready Atithigva for the Gungus.'3 Even the noun iskartar governs the accusative: RV. viii. I. I2; 20. 26 izkartd vihrutam pfinah 'he heals wounds up again.' There is really no original prefix is or is: it has been abstracted in this single connection (with root kar) from combinations like dniskrta, which was misunderstood to be dn-is-krta, but is in reality d-nis-krta.4 In this way arose the expression iskariaram 'Cf. Macdonell, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1895, p. I7I. 2 The Pet. Lexs. and Grassmann under root kar (kr) posit it as a prepositional prefix is. 3Here /skaram is in punning juxtaposition with Zsan in the next pada, a seductive circumstance which the Vedist will estimate at its right value; cf. Sacred Books of the East, vol. XLII, index, under 'Puns' and 'Alliteration.' 4 RV. ix. 39. 2. The padakara, as usual, divides dnilz-krta.

Soc., the following statement was printed: "The difficult word ddhrigu I shall hope on some other occasion to explain as d-dhrigu 'not poor, rich, liberal,' *dhrigu = Avestan drighu 'poor.' The word is employed as an epithet of both divine and human sacrificers; see especially RV. viii. 22. II; 93. II." Since then there has appeared (1895) Bergaigne's 'Quarante Hymnes du Rig-V6da' (edited by Professor Henry), with a note on ddhrigu on pp. 114-15. Bergaigne divides the word into ddhri+gu, assuming that adhri is 'not withholding' (root dhar) and gu 'cow.' The compound is next translated, 'qui a une vache qui ne retient pas (son lait?),' or, preferably, 'dont la vache n'est pas retenue, ne peut pas l'&amp;tre.' It is of interest to note that Bergaigne picked out the same two passages (RV. viii. 22. I ; 93. II) as those calculated to determine the sense of the word, and his final, somewhat uncertain, conclusion does not in effect differ very materially from the one advanced by the writer. The theory that the word contains the stem gu 'cow' was considered and rejected by the writer because of the word adhrija, RV. v. 7. io. This, though it occurs in an obscure passage, seems to be contrasted with dpfrVna 'not giving (to the priests),' and invites analysis on the same line as ddhrigu, i. e. a-dhrija 'not poor, liberal.' Bergaigne's analysis of ddhrigu places an impassable gap between the two words: according to our analysis the words represent two adjective derivatives from the same root: *dhrigu and *dhrija are about equal to kr;d or natdhamdna, RV. ii. 12.6; ddhrigu and adhrija are similar toyukfdgrdvan and sutdsoma in the same stanza. Certainly in viii. 93. II ddhrigur jdnah has this meaning unquestionably. The fact that ddhrigu lapses into the declension of go 'cow' (nom. plur. ddhrigdvah) is of little importance, because the meaning of the word was sure to suggest that stem; it is worthy of no consideration if, as we assume, it is 429</page><page sequence="32">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. necessary to explain ddhrigu and adhrija in the same way. As regards the accentuation of adhrija, cf. ajdra, etc. (Knauer, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVII 7); for ddhrigzu cf. dnrju, etc. (ibid., p. 26). Once more, then, ddhrigu and adhrija seem to me to mean 'liberal givers (sacrificers),' used to designate the reciprocal relations of the pious sacrificers and the gods who respond with their divine gifts, as indicated especially in RV. viii. 22. II. VI.-TRITA, THE SCAPE-GOAT OF THE GODS, IN RELATION TO ATHARVA-VEDA Vi. 112 AND II3.1 The legend alluded to in AV. vi. I 112 and I 3 is stated as follows in Maitr. S. iv. I. 9 (p. 12, 1. 2 if.): "The gods did not find a person upon whom they might be able to wipe off from them- selves the bloody part of the sacrifice (that is, any one upon whom they might transfer their guilt).2 Then Agni spake: 'I will create for you him upon whom ye shall wipe off from your- selves the bloody part of the sacrifice.' He threw a coal upon the waters; from that Ekata was born. (He threw) a second one (dvilcyam); from that Dvita (was born). (He threw) a third one (trtlyam); from that Trita (was born) ... The gods came wiping themselves3 upon (Ekata, Dvita and Trita); they (in turn) wiped themselves upon one who was overtaken by the rising sun, i. e. one over whom the sun rises while he is asleep; this one (wiped himself) upon one who was overtaken (asleep) by the setting sun4; he upon one afflicted with brown teeth; he upon one with diseased nails5; he upon one who had married a younger sister before the older one was married; he upon one whose younger brother had married before himself; he upon one who had married before his older brother; he upon one who had slain a man; he upon one who had committed an abortion. Beyond him who has committed an abortion the sin does not pass."6 1 An abstract of this paper was published in the Proc. Amer. Or. Soc., March, I894 (Journal, vol. XVI, pp. cxix ff.).

In Tait. Br. iii. 2. 8. 9 ff. the same story is told with variants: "The gods, having brought an oblation, said, 'Upon whom shall we wipe ourselves?' Then Agni spake, 'Do ye place forms (bodies) into me; I shall beget for you one upon whom ye shall wipe yourselves.' The gods placed forms (bodies) into Agni. Hence it is said that Agni is all the divinities. He threw a coal upon the waters; from that Ekata was begotten. He threw a second one (dvitiyam); from that Dvita was begotten. He threw a third one (trtiyam); from that Trita was begotten. The gods wiped themselves upon (these) water-sprites (namely, Ekata, etc.); they upon one who was overtaken (asleep) by the rising sun; he upon one who was overtaken (asleep) by the setting sun; he upon one with diseased nails; he upon one afflicted with brown teeth; he upon one who married a younger sister before the older was married; he upon one whose younger brother has married before himself; he upon a slayer of a man; he upon a slayer of a Brahman. Beyond the slayer of a Brahman the sin does not pass." Variants of the story occur also in the Kath. S. xxxi. 7; Kap. S. xlvii. 7 (cf. also (B. i. 2. 3. I ff.; Katy. (r. ii. 5. 26; Mahidhara to VS. i. 23; Ap. (r. i. 25. I5; Para9. Dharm. iv. 23); and similar lists of sinful personages may be quoted from a variety of Satras and later Smarta-texts: they have been assembled by Professor Delbriick in his monograph, 'Die indogermanischen Verwandschaftsnamen,' Transactions of the Royal Saxon Aca- demy, vol. XI, nr. V, pp. 578 if. (200 if. of the reprint)1; cf. also Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 315. All those mentioned in the lists are obviously regarded as burdened with guilt (Jnas); and the legend clearly marks them as persons upon whom, therefore, the guilt of others may be unloaded. 1I would remark in passing that the crime of the sinful parents designated as agre-didhisu 'he who marries a younger sister, the older being still unmar- ried,' and didhisa-pati [see Delbriick, 1. c., p. 583 (205)], is visited upon their son, who goes by the name of ddidhisavya, and is typical for a despicable inferior person in the formula ahe ddidhisavya ud atas tistha anyasya sadane szda yo 'smat pdkatarah 'Hey, daidhisavya, get up from here: sit upon the seat of another who is inferior to us.' The formula occurs TS. iii. 2. 4. 4; Katy. (r. ii. I. 22; Ap. Cr. xii. 20. 8; Kauc. 3. 5; 137. 37; Vait. Su. I. 20, and is employed to clear the seat of the Brahman about to perform a sacrifice from an imaginary interloper. There must have been a peculiarly strong stigma upon the ddidhisavya to cause him to figure in such an exorcism. Cf. also Ait. Br. vii. 27. The word is to be added to the list of Hindu designations of relationship. 43I</page><page sequence="34">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. Another legend, which reads like a remote echo of the one stated above, occurs at (B. i. 2. 3. I f. (cf. SBE. XII 47 ff.). Its essence is that Agni, after his three older brothers had worn themselves out in the service of the gods-a story upon which the Brahmanas are constantly ringing the changes-fled into the waters, lest he should succumb to the same fate. But the gods discovered him there, and Agni spat upon the waters because they had not proved a safe refuge. Thence sprang the Aptya (cf. dpya in the account of the Tait. Br. above) deities, Trita, Dvita and Ekata. "They roamed about with Indra, even as nowadays a Brahmana follows in the train of a king. When he slew Vigvarflpa, the three-headed son of Tvastar, they also knew of his going to be killed; and straightway Trita slew him. Indra, assuredly, was free from that (sin), for he is a god. "And the people thereupon said: 'Let those be guilty of the sin who knew about his going to be killed !' 'How ?' they asked. 'The sacrifice shall wipe it off upon (shall transfer it to) them,' they said" (Professor Eggeling's translation). The Aptyas, then, loaded with the guilt (or impurity) of the sacrifice, determine to pass this guilt on, and they pick out as their victim him who performs a sacrifice without conferring the dakqinda upon the officiating priest. Further, the impure rinsing water is poured out for the Aptyas with the formulas "For Trita thee! For Dvita thee! For Ekata thee!" (cf. VS. i. 23, and Mahidhara's comment thereon). Similarly Sayana to RV. i. 52. 5 describes the relation of Trita and the rest of the Aptyas: devdnda havirlepanigharsandya 'gneh sakdfdd apsv ekato dvitas trita iti trayah purusdjajnire 'in order to rub off (upon them) the pollution of the gods, caused by their oblations, three persons were begotten from Agni in the waters-namely, Ekata, Dvita and Trita.' Cf. also Sayana's introduction to RV. i. 105. The human beings upon whom Trita1 and the other Aptyas wipe off the guilt of the gods deposited in themselves are sinners or outcasts without exception. Aside from the testimony of the legends above, VS. xxx presents a fictitious, schematic list of human beings, fit to be sacrificed at the purusamedha, the human sacrifice, and, in verse 9, the parivilta, the parivividdna and the edidhisuhpati (!) are sacrificed respectively to the female personi- lCf. RV. ix. 34. 4. 432</page><page sequence="35">THE INTERPRETATION OF THE VEDA. fications of evil, Nirrti, Araddhi and Niskrti. In Ap. (r. ix. 12. II an expiatory rite is performed for a still larger part of these lists, and in Vasistha's Dharmagastra they are designated as enasvin 'loaded with guilt (enas).' It follows that Trita must also have committed some crime which in his turn fitted him for the position of scape-goat of the gods. The nature of this crime is, in our judgment, indicated in part in the version of the legend in the gat. Br. above. The statement is made there that Trita, while attending Indra, knew of his (Indra's) murder of Vigva- rupa: "knew of his going to be killed, and straightway Trita slew him. Indra, assuredly, was free from that (sin), for he is a god. And the people thereupon said: 'Let those be guilty of the sin who knew about his going to be killed."' Indra's drastic performances upon the great variety of demons whom he slays, coupled as they are at times with wiles and treachery, have not failed to arouse the compunctions of a certain school of Vedic moralists, who contemplate his exploits with mingled sorrow and fear for Indra's position as a righteous god. So e. g. in TB. i. 7. I. 7, 8; Paic. Br. xii. 6. 8, and Maitr. S. iv. 3. 4, Indra is blamed for having betrayed and slain his quondam friend Namuci, and is compelled to perform purificatory rites; see 'Contributions to the Interpretation of the Veda,' Third Series, JAOS. XV I60. Similarly, Vrtra is betrayed in TS. ii. 5. I. 6; vi. 5. I. I-3; MS. iv. 5. 6; Paic. Br. xx. I5. 6 ff.; Vas. Dh. v. 7. Especially the death of Vigvarapa, Tvastar's son, is treated by certain texts with a naive affectation of horror, and accounted as amounting to Brahman-murder, the crime upon which TB. iii. 2. 8. ii (and other texts quoted by Professor Delbriick above) remarks: 'Beyond the slayer of a Brahman the sin does not pass.' Thus, in TS. ii. 5. I. 2, the beings (bhAtdni) cry to Indra: "thou art the slayer of a Brahman"; see also the ?antiparvan of the Mahabharata (xii. 132. I0 ff.) and the Rig-vidhana iii. 5. 4.1 Since, now, Indra's misdeeds, on account of their prominence, are likely to have given rise to the notion of misdeeds on the part of the gods (devdinasd, AV. vi. III. 3; x. I. I2),2 it was natural that some personage closely associated with Indra-a personage, moreover, who could be construed as subservient or at least 1Here Indra's guilt as a slayer of a Brahman is formulated in the most matter-of-fact fashion: brahmaha tupura fakras tvastram halvd tv rsimprabhum ' akra (i. e. Indra), as a slayer of a Brahman, once upon a time slew the son of Tvastar, a mighty Rsi.' 2 Cf. also Ap. (r. xiii. 17. 9; Paic. Br. i. 6. I. 433</page><page sequence="36">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. ancillary to him-should be picked out for the unenviable posi- tion. For this Trita seems fitted to an eminent degree. Trita is in general the double of Indra in his struggles with the demons. A passage like RV. i. 187. I pitiUi n' stosam . . .ydsya frild vy djasd vrtrdgrh viparvam arddya 'Let me now praise the drink by whose might Trita tore Vrtra joint from joint,' suits Indra as well as Trita.' In RV. i. 52. 5; v. 86. I; viii. 7. 24 he appears as Indra's coadjutor, and, in the first one of these passages, as Indra's predecessor and model in the fights against the dragons. In x. 48. 2 Indra gets the cows for Trita from the dragon, and in i. I63. 2 Trita in his turn appears as Indra's servitor, harnessing the horse which Indra rides; in viii. 12. i6 Trita prepares the Soma for Indra; and in viii. 52. I (Val. 4. I) Indra enjoys Trita's song addressed to him. In x. 99. 6 Indra is represented as over- coming 'the six-eyed, three-headed demon' (Vigvarapa); and Trita, strengthened by Indra's might, slays the boar with a brazen-pointed weapon.2 Above all RV. x. 8. 8, 'This Trita Aptya, knowing (the nature of) his weapons derived from the Fathers, and impelled by Indra, fought against the three-headed and seven-rayed (monster), and, slaying him, he freed the cows of the son of Tvastar.' Compare also ii. II. I9. Whether, now, we regard Trita as the faded predecessor of Indra in the r61e of a demiurge, being, as it were, the Indo- Iranian Hercules (cf. the Avestan Thra6taona Athwya), sup- planted in part in the land of the seven streams by Indra; whether we regard him, as would appear from some passages of the Rig-Veda, as Indra's lieutenant; or whether we follow Ber- gaigne, La Religion v6dique, II, pp. 326, 330, in viewing him as a divine sacrificer3-in each case the moralizing fancy, which would whitewash the cruelties incidental upon Indra's valued services, naturally alights upon Trita, and makes him bear the burden of his superior's misdeeds. And this again has been 1Cf. 'Contributions,' Fifth Series, JAOS. XVI, p. 32, and Yaska's Nirukta ix. 25, where Indra is substituted outright. 2There seems to be a certain significance in the use of the verb damanyat with Indra, while Trita's part in the affair is described by the more cruel verb han (dyoagraya). 3Bergaigne, 1. c., 326: "Ce qu'il importera d'etablir, c'est que Trita, tout dieu qu'il est, n'agit que par le sacrifice, et qu'il est, au moins dans certaines formules, subordonne a d'autres dieux, et particulierement a Indra." And p. 330: "Mais Trita dans ses exploits guerriers, garde toujours son rOle de sacrificateur." Macdonell, in the article cited above, concludes that Trita in his original nature was the third or lightning form of the god Agni. 434</page><page sequence="37">THE INTERPRETA TION OF THE VEDA. generalized so that in AV. vi. II3 the gods in general, without specification, are said to have wiped off their guilt upon Trita. In general it is a familiar conception in India, as it is in Greece, that the gods are afflicted with the weaknesses of men, and a passage like (;at. Br. xiv. 4. 2. 22 = Brh. Ar. Up. i. 4. Iol breathes none too great a reverence for them, and indicates that the distance between devas and men, especially Brahmans, was at times not felt to be very great. With this belief on hand, it is an easy step to the assumption that the sins of men had been deposited in them by the gods through the special agency of their scape-goat Trita. And conversely, as early as RV. viii. 47. 13 ff., the gods are implored to deposit all manner of evil upon Trita: 'The evil, 0 gods, which has been done openly and that which has been done covertly, all that do ye remove far away from us to Trita Aptya,' etc. Cf. also AV. xix. 56. 4. The rites within which AV. vi. I12 and 113 are embedded in the Kaugika-satra (46. 26-29), in their turn, have for their object the removal of the sin of him whose younger brother marries first, as also of the prematurely married younger brother. Sym- bolically the sin is again removed, this time to a non-living object, being washed off upon reeds which are then placed upon foam in a river: as the foam vanishes so does the sin: "While reciting the two hymns AV. vi. II2 and II3 (the performing priest) ties fetters made of muija-grass upon the limbs of the parivitti and the parivividdna,2 as they sit at the edge of a body of water (a river), sprinkles them by means of bunches of grass, and rinses them off. Placing other fetters upon the foam (in the river), he lets them flow forth, while reciting the hemistich AV. vi. II3. 2cd ('lose thyself with the foam of the rivers,' etc.). And, having entered the dwelling, (the priest) sprinkles them while reciting all lya evamh veda 'hamh brahmd 'smi 'ti sa idam? sarvarh bhavati tasya ha na devdf cand 'bhatyd ifate. 2 Darila: 'The younger married brother along with unmarried older brother.' Kesava, somewhat differently: ' An expiation for him who marries, performs the rite of setting up the fire, and undergoes the consecration for the Soma- sacrifice, while the older brother is living.' Cf. the sins of the paryadhatar and the parydhita 'the younger brother who sets up the fire before his older brother, and the older brother who is passively implicated in the same sin,' and the sins of the pariyastar and the parzsta 'the younger brother who is consecrated for the Soma-sacrifice before the older, and the older brother who is passively implicated in the same sin.' See Professor Delbriick's work quoted above, pp. 580-I (202-3). 435</page><page sequence="38">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. the hymns of the waters" (a series of hymns assembled in Kauc. 7. 4, note). The treatment of the Kaucika embraces but one side of the hymn in employing it in connection with the expiatory perform- ances of the parivitta and the parivividdna. It seems to me that this is too narrow, and that the hymns were constructed to cover all the crimes in the catalogues connected with the legends of Trita given above. This, at least, is in Kegava's mind when, commenting upon Kauc. 46. 26 ff., he says: 'Now the expiation is stated for him who marries, performs the rite of building the fire, and undergoes the consecration for the Soma-sacrifice, while the older brother is alive.' Further, the text of both hymns (vi. 112. 3; II3. 2) states distinctly that the sins in question shall be wiped off (mrksva from root marj, the technical word of the legends) upon the abortionist, the bhr.niahan, whose crime figures as the most shocking one at the end of the lists. This indicates that the entire list of sins is in the mind of the poet, even though he intends to direct his charm against some special part of them. Finally, the expression dvddafadha' in vi. II3. 3 'deposited in a dozen places is that which has been wiped off on Trita-namely, the sins belonging to man,' refers, in our opinion, again to the list of crimes, which are stated variously as from 9-I I in number, the use of the number 12 being due to its formulaic and solemn character. From all this it seems that the hymns have in mind at least all the sins which arise from the inversion of the order of precedence as between the younger and older brothers, and probably the rest also. The two hymns again present a marked instance of the close interlacing between the legendary material of the Brahmanas and the Mantras.' I doubt whether the true purport of them would ever have become clear without the legends reported above, and their previous treatment owes a certain degree of vagueness to the absence of these legends from the apparatus of the translators. The hymns have been translated by Ludwig, Der Rigveda, III 469, 444; Grill, Hundert Lieder der Atharva-Veda2, pp. 15, I7I; Hardy, Die Vedisch-brahmanische Periode, p. 20I. Cf. also Zimmer's luminous allusion to vi. II3, Altindisches Leben, p. 315; and Bergaigne et Henry, Manuel v6dique, p. I54. Ludwig introduces vi. I12 with the caption 'Heirat. Fiir vater mutter sohn,' and defines it (1. c., p. 470) as follows: 'Der bruder der 1Cf.'Contributions,' Third Series, JAOS. XV, p. I63; Fifth Series, ib.

Grill treats both hymns rather too vaguely under the caption 'krankheit' (p. 8 ff.). The Anukramanl defines vi. II2 as agneyam, vi. I3 as pausnam. We may add a translation of the two hymns, undertaken in the light of the preceding exposition: vi. 112. I.

The fetters with which the older brother, whose younger brother has married ,before him, has been bound, with which he has been encumbered and shackled limb by limb, may they be loosened; since fit for loosening they are.
