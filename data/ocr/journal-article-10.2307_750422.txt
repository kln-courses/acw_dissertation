<plain_text><page sequence="1">A GIOTTESQUE EPISODE IN ENGLISH MEDIAEVAL ART By Otto Paicht C ultural and artistic movements or ideas travelled with no less speed in the Middle Ages than in modern times.1 Less than twenty years separate the foundation of the new art of painting, connected for us with the names of Giotto and Duccio, from the first manifestations of Italian influence in the art of the neighbouring countries. Giotto's frescoes in the Arena Chapel were com- pleted in 1305, Duccio's Maesta in 131. The first echo of these epoch-making artistic events can be found in France in Pucelle's miniatures of 1327 (Bible of Robert de Billing); in Austria in the paintings of the Klosterneuburg altarpiece (1324-1329); in Spain in the illuminations decorating the book of the Privileges of Mallorca (I334).2 Yet at this time Italian influence was not confined to schools of painting flourishing in countries which bordered on Italy. It was equally strong in the contemporary miniature painting of far distant England. No student of English illumination can have overlooked this fact, yet it has never been stressed or even recorded. We are completely in the dark as to how the contact with Italian art was effected. No documents have come to light or have been published which tell of Italian artists visiting England or of English painters travelling to Italy. The works of art themselves are the sole witnesses to this contact, but they speak an unmistakable language. For instance, the Crucifixions from the Gorleston (P1. 14a) or from the Douai Psalters recall immediately various Trecento paintings which may have served as models.3 The closest parallels to them are to be found in Siennese paintings such as the Crucifixion by a pupil of Duccio in an American private collection4 (for the whole composition and particularly for the motive of St. John, P1. I4b) or that by Simone Martini5 (for the violent pathos of the figure of Mary Magdalen, P1. 14c). It is, however, not only the introduction of new iconographic motives or the use of a new language of dramatic gesticulation which distinguish the Crucifixion pages of the two East Anglian Psalters from all earlier English book-painting. The change goes much deeper: the whole character of the miniature as book-decoration has been radically transformed. This becomes sufficiently clear if we compare the Gorleston Psalter with an earlier work of the East Anglian School. In the Crucifixion of the Psalter of Robert de Lisle (Brit. Mus., Arundel MS. 83)6 each figure is bounded by its own architectural frame; there is no common stage on which they act; the composition is not erected on a consistent ground-plan, it is projected into the different compartments of a space- less, flat, geometrical pattern. The whole is closely akin to stairied-glass design.7 In the Gorleston Psalter there is one common stage for all figures. This stage, although of small recession, forms a solid basis on which to plant weighty figures. The surface of the page is no longer filled with a two-dimensional pattern of architectural design and rhythm, it has been transformed into picture- space. The third dimension has made its appearance. The only element which is now, in the strict sense of the word, on the surface of the page, is the border. Naturally the scene within the border, enacted in the continuity of the imaginary space, has a single frame and is no longer split up into separate compartments. It is not an architectural frame, but resembles that of a panel painting, with portrait medallions stuck into it. The motive is certainly borrowed from Italian sources, but is apparently not inspired by Italian book-illumination. One would look in vain for it among the 1 The disadvantages which lay in the undeveloped state of the technical and material communications Between different countries were apparently more than offset by the international structure and organization of the church, the main centre of creative energies in mediaeval times. An international phenomenon such as that of Cistercian art (architecture as well as book-decoration) has no parallel in the post-mediaeval world where frontier barriers were strengthened by the growth of national states. 2 For reproductions see H.

It cannot be denied that the experiment was highly successful. Yet among the many decorative systems which the genius of English illumination created and which represent perhaps its most original contribution to mediaeval art, the system of the East Anglian artists was undoubtedly the most problematic. It is, I think, even legitimate to ask whether in our case we can still speak of it as genuine book-decoration. Not that it would have been an infringement of the aesthetic laws of book-decoration to employ monumental forms on a small scale. That had been done in the Middle Ages over and over again without impairing in the least the autonomous character of the one or other branch of art. It is something else which is beginning to upset the aesthetic structure of the mediaeval book. And that is the attempt at an illusion of space, of depth which is extending behind the surface of the page. For, this illusion comes into conflict with the conception of the book which primarily suggests a movement of the reader's eye along the page-surface in the direc- tion of the script and secondly implies the idea of a succession of leaves lying behind the one page at which we are looking. The spectator of a three-dimensional picture and the reader of script have necessarily different view-points and from now on therefore the illuminator is confronted with the difficult problem of reconciling these divergent perspectives in order to preserve the aesthetic unity of the book. The changes in the organization of the historiated initial are necessarily the best test for the new situation which has arisen. For this is the point where script and picture meet. In the mediaeval system of book-illumination the closest relationship is established between the whole of the script and the picture or ornament. The initial, interwoven with figures, or scenes, forms an intricate pattern, a complete aesthetic unit, which is neither image nor ornament in the ordinary sense of the word. This so-called historiated initial stands out from the rest of the script through the vigorous expressiveness of its design, yet it uses the same neutral foil as the script, the empty ground of the page. And should a separate background be used for the initial, it is by preference of the immaterial colour of gold, which does not break the flat expanse of the page.3 This holds good throughout the Middle Ages, from the Irish manuscripts down to the early Gothic schools of illumination. It is with some of the East Anglian miniatures that a sudden change can first be noted. Here, on the same page, two kinds of background may now appear; behind the script we have the flat white surface of the page, whereas the ground inside the initial has given way to the illusion of a hollow space. Our eye, in fact, is following two movements, one along the lines of the text, the other through the openings of the initial into the depth of the picture behind. Initials and medallions of the border are like frames to be looked through as we look through the aperture of a peep-show. A perfect example is the initial with the Last Judgment in the St. Omer Psalter (P1. I4d).4 The whole pictorial idea is clearly based on the gradual penetration of the spectator's eye into the imaginary depth behind the page-surface. Along this line a strange vision unfolds itself: rows of graves receding up to the horizon, and in this vast churchyard, the host of dead rising suddenly 1 An exception is the Venetian school; an example of C. I30o repr. in Versteigerungskatalog H. Gilhofer &amp; K. Ransch- burg, Luzern, 14-15 June, 1932, No. 30, P1. 8; a much later example repr. in H. J. Hermann, Die Italienischen Handschriften des Ducento u. Trecento, Beschr. Verzeichnis, etc., V, 2, pls. lxxxiv, lxxxv. But these Venetian miniature borders are out of the question as models for the East Anglian borders of 1320 for the simple reason that the Trecentesque style of painting--in the main a Tuscan creation-so strongly notice- able in the pictures of the Crucifixion in the Gorleston and Douai Psalters, only succeeds in prevailing over the powerful Byzantinism of Venetian art in the second half of the century. Venice, however, shows us from where the medallion-frieze border is ultimately derived. It is a Byzantine design, used in icons or works of goldsmith's art such as the Pala d'Oro in San Marco. Duccio in his panel frames (see below) followed the same models. 2 C. Weigelt, Sienese Painting of the Trecento, Florence, 1930, pl. I. 3 The other colour much in use is azure blue. Both, gold and azure, are neutral colours (actually space-colours), but of greater dignity than the colour of the parchment. Thus, gold or azure foils lend higher significance to the initial without interrupting the context of the script or page. 4 Millar, op. cit., pl. 2o.</page><page sequence="3">A GIOTTESQUE EPISODE IN ENGLISH MEDIAEVAL ART 53 from their tombs, in answer to the trumpet's call. As our eye proceeds into the depth we see the various stages and episodes of the Resurrection in close succession: in the first row appears a head; in the second a torso, further back a whole body has emerged and one corpse has decided on coming out legs foremost. They all move with the greatest agility, fleshless figures, apparently unbound by earthly gravity. The artist, combining all these elements, achieves an uncanny effect, well suited to this eschatological theme.1 The miniatures in which Italian influence first asserts itself in England can all be dated between I320-40, not later than about two decades after the new art of painting had appeared in Italy itself.2 The new style reached England direct as an import from Italy and not through an inter- mediary French channel. One is driven to this conclusion by two observations: first, that the stylistic evidence points to first-hand knowledge of the Italian prototypes. Secondly, that Italian influence in French art appears at exactly the same date and not earlier, in the works of Jean Pucelle (the first dated example in I327). These miniatures of Pucelle, moreover, show that the French selected quite different Italian elements and assimilated them in an entirely different way.3 There can be no doubt as to the part of England in which the Italianate style is to be located. All the Italianate miniatures are found exclusively in manuscripts which were made for, or in the diocese of Norwich or at Peterborough.a The whole group is called East Anglian, although Peter- borough only borders on the province of East Anglia. But the so-called East Anglian School of illumination which figures in every handbook, comprises, of course, more than our Italianate style and the term 'school' has here to be understood in its widest sense. For what binds the East Anglian group of miniatures together, is not so much a common style, as a common tradition and particularly a common system of decoration. In fact, one can distinguish at least three different styles and still more hands. There is first a purely Gothic, pre-Italian style, represented by the Peterborough Psalter in Brussels, Bibl. roy. MSS 9961-62 (end of the I3th century), by the first part of the Psalter Arundel MS. 83 in the British Museum (c. 300oo) and by the bulk of the Gorleston Psalter illumina- tions (c. I3O6).5 Secondly comes the Trecentesque style which we have been discussing. Only two books, the Douai (c. I322-25) and the St. Omer Psalter, British Museum Add. MS. 398Io (c. I325-30), are entirely in this manner.6 It further occurs in those illuminations which have been added to the Gorleston and Ormesby Psalters (c. 1325).7 1 The space-composition is so astonishingly bold that one is inclined to suspect the picture to be a close imitation of an Italian prototype. Yet the nearest Italian rendering of the Last Judgment I have been able to find is a miniature in a Roman Missal of the Rossiana, MS. VIII. 214, fol. 8 (repr. in H. Tietze, Die illum. Hss. der Rossiana, Leipzig, I9 11, No. 115, pl. 2). But this MS. dates from the middle of the x4th century. A better, but still later Italian parallel is repr. in P. Wescher, Miniaturen des Kupferstichkabinetts der Staatl. Museen Berlin, No. 638, fig. 76. 2 For the chronology see S. C. Cockerell, The Gorleston Psalter, pp. 3, 4, 8, 9, i9; and idem, The Ormesby Psalter (Two East Anglian Psalters at the Bodleian Library), Oxford, 1926, (Roxburghe Club), pp. 15-16. 3 For reproductions of Pucelle's work see L. Delisle, Les Heures dites de Jean Pucelle, Paris, 191o; H. Y. Thompson and S. C. Cockerell, The Book of Hours of Tolande of Flanders, London, 1905. I know of only one English MS. for the illu- mination of which Pucelle's style could have been the model, namely the "Thaymouth" Hours in Mrs. H. J. Thompson's Collection, reproduced in H. J. Thompson, A Lecture on some English illuminated Manuscripts, London, 1902, Pls. XIV-XXX. 4 F. Wormald draws my attention to a Psalter of Yorkshire provenance (Lambeth Palace, MS. 233, reprinted in E. G. Millar, "Les principaux MSS A peintures du Lambeth Palace A Londres," Bull. de la Soc. Franc. de Repr. de MSS d peintures, 9e Ann6e, Paris, 1925) as an instance of certain traces of Italian influence outside East Anglia. It seems, however, doubtful to me whether the Italianate elements really belong to the original state of the illumination. As far as I can judge from the reproductions I find the Italian influence not con- fined to the ornament on fol. 15 alone (where it has already been noticed by Millar, op. cit., p. 9, P1. XXXVII), but recognizable also in the modelling of the figures on fol. 44 or fol. 81v. (Millar, Pls. XXXVIII, XXXIX.) This modelling, the way in which the draperies are shaded, is, however, not consistent with the general design of the figures and their purely linear structure. 5J. v. d.

VIII.</page><page sequence="4">54 OTTO PACHT Finally, there is the third style, distinctly Gothic in its general make-up, sharply defined, linear and rhythmic, sculptural rather than painterly in its modelling. Its main representatives are the bulk of the Ormesby Psalter illuminations, the Bromholm Psalter in the Bodleian Library MS. Ash- mole 1523, the Dublin Apocalypse and Gregory's Moralia in Emmanuel College, Cambridge (MS. No. I I2).1 The only date for this third group is provided by the Ormesby Psalter, for the greater part of this MS. must have been executed before the Psalter was acquired by Robert of Ormesby (c. 1325) and its decoration finally completed on his orders in the Italianate style. This third group has hitherto been regarded as the link between the first, purely Gothic group and the Italianate style. And consequently the approximate date of I3Io has been proposed for it by Cockerell and Millar.2 It is indeed very probable that the known representatives of our third group precede in date the extant examples of the Italianate style. Yet whether the formation of their style as such is conceivable without knowledge of Italian models seems open to doubt. The stylistic differences between the first (i.e. the purely Gothic) and third group lie in the main in the following: the modelling of the figures, the border-decoration and the type of the drol- leries. Let us take the last point first. The history and particularly the iconography of Gothic drollery has still to be written, but even now, while our knowledge of this subject is still very rudimentary, we can clearly discern in the grotesques of the East Anglian Psalters a common set of iconographic motives. We have several times, for instance, the scene of the woman who pursues a fox which is escaping with her hen;3 the motive of birds and apes, riding on the backs of other animals and chasing each other; and the somewhat similar motive of fighting youths mounted on wild beasts or on the backs of other men.4 In the Ormesby Psalter the programme of the drolleries is virtually the same (P1. I5d), although it includes now the representation of problems or puzzle-stories. A new species has, however, suddenly appeared among the cast who perform all these clownings and parodies. The customary world of mediaeval drolleries, a turbulent crowd made up of mis-shapen jesters, hooded goblins, monstrous animals, many derived from the Bestiary, animals performing human duties and finally genre-figures, is now joined by a strange selection of nude and semi-nude figures, adding a distinctly pagan element to the unholy, but strictly mediaeval phantasmagoria.5 That these figure-motives are more than a mere distant echo from the classic world can be proved by at least one very striking instance. The page in the Ormesby Psalter on which is the beginning of the Io9th Psalm, contains on the margin, close to the large initial filled with the picture of the Trinity, a figure (P1. I5b) which looks entirely alien to its surroundings.6 It is the figure of a trumpeter, his hair bound by a floating scarf, his body only slightly veiled by a light drapery, twisted in a dance-like movement. The puzzle of this extraordinary attire, however, resolves itself once the context is found from which it was transplanted to these pages. Iconographically the figure comes from the classical trumpeter who later, in Roman times, used as "tubicinus" to precede triumphal processions.7 If we compare the Ormesby Psalter 1 All known examples repr. in Cockerell, The Ormesby Psalter, and M. R. James, The Bromholm Psalter, Oxford, 1926; M. R. James, The Dublin Apocalypse, Roxburghe Club, Cam- bridge, 1932; further Millar, op. cit., pls. 2-61. 2 Millar, op. cit., p. 3. 3 It first occurs, as far as I can see, on the margin of the Psalter of All Souls College, Oxford, MS. 6, fol. 13 (later addition to the original Psalter decoration?); then in the Psalter from Peterborough in Brussels and in the Gorleston and Ormesby Psalters. Cf. Millar, I, pl. Ioo; II, pls. 5, 17. 4 Cf. Millar, I, pl. 10oo; II, pls. 4, 19. Some of these motives are not confined to the East Anglian group, they are also used in other schools as, for instance, in the Queen Mary Psalter, G. Warner, The Queen Mary Psalter, London, 1912, pls. x80, 192, I94. Perhaps the most remarkable of the early sets of marginal decorations is that of the Rutland Psalter whose drolleries anticipate in many ways the Ormesby Psalter grotesques, particularly in their quasi-pagan note. The problem of their origin is even more puzzling than the genealogy of the Ormesby Psalter grotesques. E. G. Millar, The Rutland Psalter, Roxburghe Club, Oxford, 1937, writes of the marginal subjects as follows: The games and sports . .. "include wrestling, both ordinary (ff. I I, 42) and pickaback (f. 70 v.). A peculiarity of many of the men represented in these as well as in the more fanciful subjects is that they are shown as naked except for a cloak over their shoulders.... A few of the subjects are taken from fables, from the Bestiary, or from the Marvels of the East, otherwise their immediate source is not apparent."

It was customary for the "tubicini," who were indispensable in classical ceremonies, to appear crowned on these occasions. The hairdress of the Ormesby grotesque is obviously nothing but the classical wreath (a LCC).1 Again, the classical trumpeter had his trumpet adjusted to his mouth by a system of straps which kept it firmly in place and enabled him to control the instrument with the left hand alone; the right, being therefore free, could be planted on the hip to give support or counterpoise. This system of straps has not been copied by the English illuminator (unless we were to see in the fluttering ribbons in the hair a last remainder of these straps), but the gesture of the right arm has been preserved. The final proof of the classical origin is supplied by the formal structure of the Ormesby grotesque-the spiral movement of the figure.2 Similar figure-motives occur from the Hellenistic period onwards, especially in Roman sarcophagus-reliefs3 (P1. I5c). Through what channels have they found their way into the atelier of a Gothic illuminator? It would be tempting to see the prototypes of the East Anglian (Ormesby Psalter, P1. I5d) drolleries in that breed of Pagan grotesques which populates the border-decoration of Neapolitan manuscripts.4 Neapolitan drolleries are almost entirely composed of nude figures, winged putti or genii, centaurs, nudes playing instruments and riding on the backs of animals, etc. Their similarity to East Anglian motives is sometimes surprising. Unfortunately, chronological difficulties forbid one to assume Neapolitan sources for our Ormesby grotesques: for the majority of the Neapolitan MSS which show the characteristic type of drolleries date from the middle of the 14th century.5 An English manuscript of 1320 can hardly be based on them. Yet there is another Italian school of illumination which specialized in grotesque decoration and which flourished in the late 13th century. This school has never been properly studied although its importance for European miniature painting can hardly be overrated. For this atelier, centred most likely in Bologna, provided the decoration of the standard works on canonical and civil law; and since copies of these Decretals etc., were sent to every European country in great numbers, their peculiar system of decoration must have been known all over the Christian world.6 Sometimes the text alone was written in Italy, the decoration, however, completed abroad as, for instance, in the case of British Museum, MS. Royal io. E. IV. This MS. comes from an Italian scriptorium and seems originally to have been destined for export to Paris, but was finally decorated in England.7 Reallexicon etc., VII, A.

Lit. 151. r See Erbach de Fiirstenau, op. cit. He mentions on p. 17 a single MS. of our Neapolitan type which can be dated as early as I320 (in the monastery of La Cava) and asserts that it has already the same kind of ornament and grotesques which we know so well from the mid-fourteenth century Neapolitan manuscripts. Since the La Cava MS. has never been reproduced I feel, in the absence of photographic evi- dence, unable to judge the significance of its border decora- tion as a possible forerunner of the East Anglian grotesques. 6 The latest survey of the history of Bolognese illumination, including bibliography, is to be found in M. Salmi, La Miniatura, p. 279 ff. (part of De Fava, Emilia e Romagna, vol. I of "I Tesori delle Biblioteche d'Italia," Milano, 1932).

A list of similar instances of mixed workmanship would be most useful.</page><page sequence="8">56 OTTO PACHT Still more interesting for our purpose is another Decretal manuscript, belonging to the Hereford Cathedral Library (P1. I5e).1 Here, too, the script is Italian and the decoration English (made about 1300).2 But while in MS. Royal Io. E. IV the English illuminator simply adapted the customary scheme of Psalter decoration to the new task, the artist of the Hereford MS. tried directly to imitate the decorative arrangement of a Bolognese Decretal book. On some pages he even re- placed the Gothic ivy-scroll by acanthus-scrolls which part in the centre of the page and wind in spirals towards the outer margins in unmistakably Bolognese fashion. Together, however, with the acanthus ornament another element of classical origin is being introduced into the margins of English books: the lively species of putti or putti-like nude figures which animate with their acro- batics the rather calligraphic movement of the scrolls. I consider it most likely that it was this class of English legal manuscripts, copying Bolognese models and their pagan border decoration, which formed the link between the playful imagery of classical invention and the Ormesby Psalter grotesques. Thus, even our third group is not free from Italian influence although in the stylistic sphere this influence is hardly tangible.3 The modelling of the naked figures in the borders is exceptionally advanced and special care is taken to stress the anatomical details. Yet the draped figures show no sign that the basic Gothic conception of the human body has been abandoned. It is true that, compared with the first East Anglian style (of about I300), the figures have gained in plasticity; but this gain has been offset by other changes such as the straightening and stiffening of the out- lines which tend to compress the figure-substance into narrow over-lengthened forms. The propor- tions are more 'Gothic' than ever before. A slight discrepancy between this conservative treatment in the central themes and the freer treatment of the marginal decoration is undeniable. The grotesques have always been considered the most vigorous and original part of the whole of East Anglian miniature production. It is not the only example in the history of artistic evolution where progressive tendencies manifest themselves first in the accessories or in the themes of minor rank. For the censorship to which new ideas are subjected by forces exterior to the artist and within him is less severe where the issues seem less important. A direct way leads from the grotesques of the Ormesby Psalter to that exuberant host of monstrous creatures which populates the margins of the Luttrell Psalter.4 In this greatest and most reckless display of English drollery design all the earlier grotesque motives reappear in endless variations, except that the type of the pagan, semi-classical grotesque is not included. This is signifi- cant and corresponds with the general tendency in the later East Anglian school towards elimination of Italian elements and reinstatement of Gothic principles. Elimination of space, flattening of modelling, reintroduction of linear rhythm are the main features in the stylistic development of East Anglian illumination in its last phase. The contact with the new artistic movement in Italy 1 Decretum Gratiani, MS. P. 9. II. A. T. Bannister (with an introduction by M. R. James), Hereford Cathedral Library Cata- logue, Hereford, 1927, pp. VI, 187, 188. 2 M. R. James, op. cit., p. 188 if. says: "The work is French, very fine, dry and crisp in style." I cannot see any evidence for this attribution. There are certainly many instances where French and English workmanship of the late 13th century become nearly indistinguishable. But in the case of the Hereford Decretals all particularities seem to me to speak in favour of English draughtsmanship. To mention only two characteristics: the way in which the drapery is divided into parallel stripes of light and dark colour and the peculiar composition of the architectural frame which surrounds some of the miniatures and which includes a gallery above from the openings of which a number of heads are looking down. This latter feature occurs in several English 14th century miniatures as, for instance, in MS. Douce 131, Bodleian Library, Oxford (Millar, op. cit., pl. 54). 3 To this third group belongs, as already mentioned, the MS. of Gregory's Moralia in Emmanuel College, Cambridge, No. 112, which in its turn forms a bridge to the openly Italianate group. Cockerell, The Ormesby Psalter etc., p. 32, already pointed out that its script shows Italian influence, and James, The Bromholm Psalter, p. 44, observed that in the borders of the Moralia MS. (the same applies to the Bromholm Psalter) small detached gold studs are interspersed in the leafwork "of a kind familiar in Italian MSS of the period, but not so large." But there is something else in the Cam- bridge Moralia MS. (Cockerell, pl. XXXV) which deserves attention: The Benedictine ecclesiastics kneeling in the margins are modelled in the same Italian manner as the kneeling figure of Ormesby in the Bodleian Psalter. If the figures of these Benedictines are not additions, then the third group must be seen rather as a contemporary of the Italian- izing group than as its predecessor. 4 Fully repr. by E.

The first encounter with the re-emerging classical world remained inconclusive. * * * The middle of the i4th century is marked in the history of English book-painting as a dark period, a period of sharp decline in output and still more in quality. 1 This much seems to be certain, that the production at least of the highly illuminated or more luxurious type of book was discon- tinued in England at that time. But although the artistic development had reached a point of stagnation, there was never a complete interruption of artistic output and, above all, no complete break in the tradition. It was chiefly in the so-called group of the Bohun manuscripts-all executed for various members of the Bohun family (1360-1380) and all stylistically closely interrelated-that English illumination was revived.2 A new system of decoration-making abundant use of mock-architectural picture frames and borders-characterizes the whole group, and it is this highly elaborate mode of decora- tion which at first sight makes one overestimate the distance separating the Bohun style from English painting of the first half of the century. The figure-style, however, strikes a more familiar note and recalls East Anglian memories. Scholars have rightly drawn attention to the similarity between the marionette-like figures of the Bohun group, with their restless activity, and the feverish performance of the figures in the tiny scenes of manuscripts such as the St. Omer Psalter.3 In fact, we may say that the Bohun style is ultimately derived from the East Anglian school in much the same way as the style of the Boquetaux Master, its French parallel, can be traced from Pucelle. The parallel goes even further, for in the English example, as in the French, there is no evidence to be found of a renewed influx of Italian elements or of direct contact with Italy.4 Yet there are two cases in English painting of the second half of the 14th century where the question of direct contact with Italy becomes acute. The one is that of the wall-paintings of St. Stephen's Chapel in Westminster, or rather of the few fragments which have survived and are to-day in the British Museum.5 At first sight they look so entirely un-English that but for their provenance they might easily have passed as the work of some provincial follower of Simone Martini. Unlike their Avignonese counterpart, however, the Westminster frescoes seem not to be the product of Italian workmanship. All the documentary evidence available points to the employment at Westminster Palace and Abbey of native painters for the new artistic activities which developed shortly after the middle of the century.6 A detailed stylistic analysis of the remaining fragments- which does not fall within the scope of our present study-may yet reveal their specifically English qualities. The second instance of strong Italian infliuence is to be found in a set of miniatures containing illustrations to the Book of Genesis (Egerton MS. 1894 of the British Museum).7 This time there are no definite indications as to the place of origin. The style of these miniatures is so uncommon, the whole aspect of the book so extraordinary that when it was first published it was not recognized as an English work of art.s The Egerton Genesis was only accepted as such after another illuminated manuscript had turned up showing not only the same style but also an English calendar.9 From this moment it was evident that this extraordinary set of miniatures and drawings must be English, but we are still only beginning to see its specifically English character. It is still an outsider in the 1 Historians usually lay the blame for this on the Black Death, which ravaged the population of England in these years. Whether this disease was really the main and only cause of the incontestable decay in the art of painting, I do not feel competent to judge. 2 M. R.

For nobody has yet attempted to define its place in the evolution of English painting. Egerton MS. 1894 consists of 20 leaves, all devoted to a continuous illustration of the book of Genesis. Each page is divided into four compartments, each compartment containing one scene, except in a few cases where a single picture fills the whole page. The cycle begins with the Creation; then comes a gap (probably one or two leaves are missing). Next comes a sort of genealogy, figures of Adam and his descendants, and then follows practically the whole story of the Book of Genesis. At the beginning of the book, each picture bears a French, or rather an Anglo-French inscription, giving in short phrases the content of the representation. Later in the set, these inscriptions are miss- ing, probably because the whole manuscript was left in a half-finished condition. Apart from these 'tituli' there is no separate text. Did such a text ever exist? Was our Egerton Genesis prefixed to a Psalter text, since in England and France we frequently find Psalters preceded by sets of pictures illustrating Bible histories? Or was it a self-contained, independent picture-book, a sort of Bible chronicle in pictures?' This question is closely linked up with another: to which class of monuments did the prototype belong which served the artist of the Egerton manuscript as model? Was it a set of miniatures such as were used as Psalter introductions, was it a Bible chronicle, or was it perhaps a cycle of wall- paintings? For it is clear that this elaborate set of Genesis illustrations cannot have been entirely our artist's invention. As a preliminary to any attempt to solve the two problems we have just mentioned, a third question has to be answered: what text is our set of pictures meant to illustrate? James, who edited the publication of our manuscript, pointed out that the accompanying inscriptions come nearest to Peter Comestor's "Historia Scholastica," a famous rationalized version of the Bible which con- tained a number of apocryphal bible-stories (Lamech, etc.).2 Now, the Latin original of the "Historia Scholastica" had been freely translated into French by Guyart Desmoulins ("Bible historiale"). But the Anglo-French inscriptions of the Egerton Genesis do not, as James already noticed,3 follow this translation literally, though they are closely related to it. What, however, is more important, and what James does not say, is that the pictures do not always correspond to the inscriptions and vice-versa. The following examples may suffice: The end of the inscription on picture 34 (fol. 6a), "il engendra Habram, Nachor, et Aran, come apiert desoutz," relates to picture 35 (fol. 6a) whose accompanying inscription covers only half of what is represented. The text of picture 37 (fol. 6b) contains more (namely the death of Thare) than is rendered visible. Picture 62 (fol. 9b) shows Abraham lying prostrate and God speaking out of a cloud. But the accompanying text gives no circumstantial account of the incident so precisely depicted in the drawing. The text which this drawing really illustrates is to be found in "Historia Scholastica" 50 (which follows the text of the Vulgate, Genesis XVII): "Et ait Dominus: Ex illa dabo tibi filium, et vocabis nomen ejus Jsaac. Cecidit Abraham in facie m."4 Finally it may be seen from the way in which the text is fitted into the spaces left empty in the composition that these inscriptions were all without exception inserted later into already existing miniatures. This much is clear, therefore, that the text which is illustrated by the miniatures of the Egerton Genesis is not the text which we read at the top of the pictures. It must have been a text based again on Comestor's "Historia Scholastica," but which at the same time had preserved a number of passages from the Vulgate text omitted in Comestor's work. Of the Abraham-Lot story, for instance, the "Historia Scholastica" gives only a very short account, whereas the Egerton Genesis (Pictures 45-48-49) (P1. I6a) illustrates the much fuller version told in the Bible (Genesis xiii, 9). There did exist in fact a text which comprised Comestor's work and the Bible-text. It is the com- pilation which S. Berger calls "Bible historiale completie," i.e. "1'edition de 1'oeuvre de Guyart, 1 James, op. cit., p. 7: "If we were to count heads, we should doubtless decide in favour of the last suggestion (i.e. Bible Histories prefixed to Psalters). But, as it is, it remains no more than a probability at best." 2 James, op. cit., p. 7 f. 3 Op. cit., p. 7 note. 4 Modern reprint of Comestor's work in Migne's Patrologia Latina, tom. 198.</page><page sequence="11">16 a-Stories of the Life of Abraham.

The term guide should not be misunderstood as suggesting a rather loose relationship between the presumed text and the pictures. On the contrary, in several instances with which we shall have to deal later, the picture is not simply a representation of the incident reported in the text, but a literal translation of the text into visual forms. It is a kind of illustration that was only possible in the Middle Ages: not the content of the text is illustrated, but the text itself, the actual words. The work of the mediaeval illuminator, his creative act, however, has always two starting-points: first the text he intends to illustrate, and secondly, the pictorial prototype he chooses to follow. And this pictorial prototype was not necessarily based on the same text and often not even con- ceived as book-illustration. There are certain features in the Egerton Genesis, certain irregularities in the sequence of the cycle which cannot be easily explained unless one assumes that the pictorial prototype of the Egerton Master (or one of the prototypes, for he may have had several) was not a set of book-illustrations, but a series of wall-paintings. On folio 2b of our manuscript we see in the upper part Lamech with his two wives and offspring; immediately beneath Noah building the Ark. On the opposite page (fol. 3a) the Lamech story is taken up again, to be followed below by the continuation of Noah's legend. It seems logical to read off the illustrations straight across the open double-page-first the whole Lamech story in the upper row, then the Noah events in the zone below. But such a frieze-like arrangement, running across the open double-page, is quite unfamiliar to book-painting. We are tempted to think of wall- painting where the frieze arrangement would be perfectly natural. There are other anomalies in the sequence of our Genesis miniatures which though less marked seem to point in the same direction. Folio 8 of our manuscript (P1. I6a), bearing no inscrip- tions, begins with the scene. of the parting of Lot and Abraham. Next, as in the Bible, comes God's promise to Abraham. Then follows a pastoral scene, and finally we see the building of the altar. There is nothing unusual in the order of the pictures provided that the pastoral scene represents the valley of Mamre where Abraham settled after he had parted from Lot. The three youths, sitting on the top of the hill, would then signify the brothers Mambre, Aner and Eschol, "les trois friers avantditz" who are suddenly mentioned in the heading to picture 56. And the tree crowning the hill might then well be meant to represent the oaktree of which the "Historia Scholastica" speaks (ch. xlv, "Habitabat autem ibi Abram circa quercum . . ."). But why are the shepherds so con- spicuously looking upwards like the shepherds at Bethlehem when the angels were descending to them?2 Neither the Bible text, nor the Historia Scholastica, nor the Bible historiale contain any- thing that would account for their behaviour. Finding nothing above their heads we follow the trend upwards and automatically connect the pastoral scene with the picture above, i.e. the scene with the parting of Abraham and Lot. It would be quite legitimate to do so since we have many instances in the Egerton Genesis where our eyes are led as by signposts from one picture to another, in some cases right across the page.3 Being induced, however, to read the parting of Abraham and Lot as forming a unit together with the shepherd-idyll below, we easily discover a certain similarity in the arrangement to that of the corresponding representation in the mosaics of Sta. Maria Maggiore in Rome (5th century) (P1. i6b).4 Here, too, we see beneath the parting of Abraham and Lot a pastoral landscape with shepherds and flocks, this time, however, apparently intended to show 1S. Berger, La Bible franfaise au moyen dge, Paris, I884, p. I57 ff. 2 One could argue, of course, that the picture was really an Annunciation to the Shepherds, adapted to the Old Testament pastoral by leaving out the choir of angels. A similar process of adaptation has undoubtedly taken place in the last picture of the days of creation (8, fol. Ib) and pro- duced an iconographic novelty. The text "come le septisme jour deux reposa," usually represented under the form of the enthroned deity, is here for the first time taken literally: God is resting like a human being among the trees of the earth. For this reclining figure the artist has obviously used the formula of Jesse from the customary Tree of Jesse representa- tion. The pastoral scene of fol. 8, however, seems to me a different case. There is no evidence that the Egerton Master ever adapted an iconographic motive to a new subject in a purely superficial manner or left important details unchanged which have no meaning in the new context. 3For instance, picture 41 pointing back to picture 4o, picture 46 pointing across the page to picture 45. 4 J.

Far-fetched as this comparison might seem, I cannot but wonder whether a wall-painting of similar description was not the ultimate source for the composition of the Egerton Master and is not the explanation of its puzzling features. I do not suggest that a lost cycle of wall-paintings contained the exact programme for our Genesis set, but I think it likely that its ancestry may be partly found in monu- mental painting and not in book-painting alone. Further criteria corroborating this view will be mentioned when we discuss the stylistic sources of the Egerton Genesis. Looking for a possible prototype of the Egerton MS. among the existing Genesis cycles we come to the conclusion that a very elaborate set of Genesis illustrations, composed in the style of a picture chronicle, must have been known to the Egerton Master and that he borrowed from it fairly fre- quently without, however, modelling the whole set or even a greater part after this prototype. It is this eclectic nature of his work which makes it so extremely difficult to reconstruct the various sources of inspiration, but which, on the other hand, is evidence of a remarkable degree of in- dependence from contemporary English tradition in iconography and style. The Middle Ages knew, roughly speaking, two types of Bible illustration and especially Old Testament illustration.1 The one follows the events of the text in a continuous narrative, aim- ing at nothing but a pictured chronicle; the other represents only the salient points of the story, the selection being guided by more or less rigid principles. The first type is almost exclusively to be found at the beginning and the close of the Middle Ages, the second is the rule in the centuries between, in the mediaeval epoch proper. There can be no doubt that our Genesis MS. has to be assigned to the first group. It is a far more extensive cycle of.Genesis illustrations than any of the sets of miniatures currently used in France or England as introductions to Psalters. The difference lies not so much in the quantity of the episodes represented as in the new descriptive spirit which transforms the succession of selected, significant moments into the one continuous flow of a chronicle. As the most effective means for achieving this the Egerton Genesis uses the method of repeating the same setting or the same personages through several consecutive pictures while simultaneously in- troducing gradual changes as required by the progress of the story. In the story of Noah we see the vineyard twice and Noah himself a third time in almost the same position as in the previous pictures.2 In the story of Abraham's sacrifice exactly the same landscape-setting is used three times.3 The tower of Babel is shown in the process of building and in the process of destruction.4 In order that we may feel the change which is taking place through two successive pictures we must be made aware of the identity of the subject. By the stressing of the constant features we are brought to see the differences and the transformation. And instead of several isolated moments the process of transformation itself becomes the real subject to be represented. This type of continuous narrative differs from its more famous late-antique counterpart in many respects, chiefly in this. The late-antique method of continuous illustration (Vienna Genesis) places several consecutive scenes on a single continuous strip of landscape.5 Instead of several identical settings, stretching from left to right and often curving back into a second tier, it embraces a number of episodes which are taking place at different times. The different sections of this scenery do not necessarily mean different localities, for distance of space stands here for distance of time. Travelling along with the extension of the space our eyes never lose the thread of the tale. A further difference is that in the Vienna Genesis the illustrations accompany the text, in the 1 My classification does not fall in with the one put forward by M. R. James in his survey of the general subject of the historical or narrative illustration of the Old Testament in S. C. Cockerell-M. R. James, A Book of Old Testament Illus- trations etc. (Roxburghe Club), Cambridge, 1927, p. I ff. James distinguishes in the Middle Ages between the "historical" and the "typical" method of illustration. But this distinction takes into account only the literary pro- gramme, not the style of the representation. There are at least two types of historical narrative and the one which pre- vails in the mediaeval epoch proper is much more akin to the "typical" method (James means what is generally called typological) than to that which we describe as continuous narrative. In the Middle Ages both the historical and the typological narrative are symbolical styles. 2 Pictures 24-26, P1. I7a. 3 Pictures 79-81. 4 Pictures 32-33. 5 Described and analysed by F.

The Vienna Genesis is an illustrated chronicle, the Egerton Genesis, however, has to be called-if one wants to be precise-a chronicle in pictures. The r6les of text and picture have been reversed and the miniatures form in their continuous pro- gress an independent whole, with short text-quotations added as commentaries. The picture is now not an accompaniment of the text, but a substitute for the text. In short, the Egerton Genesis is a picture-book, i.e. belongs to that special genre of books which the late mediaeval inventories call "bible toute figurde" and which came into being as early as the late 12th century.1 If this self- sufficiency which is so outstanding a characteristic of the Egerton Genesis miniatures is taken into account, one can hardly believe it possible that this set of Genesis pictures was designed as a prefix to a Psalter text.2 In the whole arrangement-each page divided in four compartments bare of any decorative frame-our MS. finds its closest parallel in an Italian Picture Bible of the late I4th century (P1. I7b) (most likely of Paduan origin), the second part of which is in the British Museum (Add. MS. 15277), whereas the first part-hitherto overlooked-is preserved in the Accademia dei Concordi di Rovigo.3 In spite, however, of all the differences just mentioned, the continuous narrative of the late- antique epoch and that of the late mediaeval epoch have much in common. So that the question unavoidably arises whether, and how far, our English I4th century Genesis set is related to late- antique Genesis cycles. James thought that the Master of the Egerton Genesis depended very 1 First studied by L.

Lauer, Les principaux MSS a Peintures de la Bibl. de l'Arsenal a Paris, Paris, 1929, pls. XI-XIII. Although this MS. does not strictly belong to the category of picture-books, since its set of pictures forms no independent whole, but an introduction to the text, I hesitate to omit it from the above list; for the miniatures, made in France in the first half of the I3th century, are obviously copied from a 9th century Byzantine set of Old Tes- tament illustrations which may have played a decisive part in the making of the Western picture-books.-"An English Picture-Book of the Late Thirteenth century" (MS. 370 in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge) has been published by James in the Walpole Soc., XXV, Oxford, 1937, P. 23 ff. James doubts, rightly I think, whether this MS. is really a Picture-Book: "one is tempted to think of the pictures as having been prefixed to a Psalter, the text of which has been discarded." It was only after the completion of this study (1941) that I saw H. Swarzenski's article on "Unknown Bible Pictures by W. de Brailes," The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, I, 1938, p. 54 ff. It raises many questions which have a direct bearing on the problems presented by the Egerton Genesis. Swarzenski considers his 3th century set of English Bible pictures to be also ultimately derived from an Early Christian picture-book. But he assumes the existence in England of a western Early Christian Bible cycle. Only after the return to normal conditions will it be possible to decide whether there were in England two different ancient tradi- tions of Bible illustrations (one of western and one of eastern origin) or whether there was only one archetype, gradually transformed, abbreviated or enlarged, by the influx of mediaeval models from the continent. 2 Another point that speaks in favour of an independent picture-book is the length of the inscriptions which far exceeds the size of mere 'tituli.' Even supposing that originally other inscriptions than these were planned, the least one could say is that at the time when the present inscriptions were added no text followed the set of pictures. 3 In the British Museum Add. MS. 15277 goes by the name of a Florentine "Bible history of the Jews." It is, in fact, a section of a Picture-Bible with inscriptions in Venetian dialect, the first part of which is cod. 6 of the Bibliotheca dell' Accademia dei Concordi in Rovigo (for this MS. see C. Frati, "Rovigo," etc. in La Bibliofilia, No. 26, Firence 1925 ff. with reprod.). On fols. 39-41 the Rovigo MS. con- tains illustrations of the book of Ruth, that is to say a section following after the British Museum part. Frati, op. cit., sug- gests that the Rovigo MS., which was up to I858 the property of the family Silvestri, came to Rovigo from Padua, probably in Napoleonic times, when the great library of Sta. Giustina was dissolved. The stylistic evidence also speaks in favour of Paduan origin since our miniatures have many points in common with the work of Giusto da Menabuoi, especially his frescoes in the Baptistery at Padua. 5</page><page sequence="16">62 OTTO PACHT little upon tradition for his selection of subjects and his compositions, and he quotes a number of cases where the iconography and the formal treatment of the subject seemed to him without any precedent and so unusual that he saw in them the original invention of our artist.1 Originality is certainly one of the outstanding qualities of his work. But even for the transitional period from the Middle Ages to modern times it is seldom safe to attribute unusual iconographical motives to the artist's personal invention. Not one of the motives described by James as unique are really new, nearly all can be traced back to some English or foreign source. The iconographical anomalies of the Egerton Genesis start with the first page. Whereas usually in the I3th or I4th century the Creator in the 'Days of Creation' is represented as standing on the right or left of the sphere or of the objects created, we find him here sitting upon an arch or bow in the universe (the circumference of the firmament) and 'doing all things by a word.' Rare as this representation is, it is by no means unique; for in the 'Days of Creation' of the Anglo-Saxon 'Caedmon' MS. of the Bodleian Library, Oxford (Junius i i) the deity is depicted in exactly the same position'which is, of course, a quite familiar one for the Christ of the Last Judgement.2 And this is not the only connection with the Anglo-Saxon Genesis-Paraphrase: James himself noticed that it is here that we get the nearest approach to the pictures of Lamech and his two wives and of the occupations of their children.3 But before we can discuss the significance of this link with Anglo-Saxon iconography we have to scrutinize the other real or alleged iconographical anomalies. There is nothing uncommon in picture 7, for what James took "for the lower part of the man still unformed," is in fact the remaining half of the clearly articulated figure of the sleeping Adam, the lower edge of the page, containing the rest of the figure, being torn away; what James, however, took for the finished part of Adam's body is Eve just formed from Adam's rib; the whole picture being, incidentally, the creation not of Adam, but of Eve. The "Death of the boy who guided blind Lamech's hand" occurs in French (Manchester, Rylands Library, MS. fr. 5) and English (Holkham Hall MS. 666) Picture-Bibles from the early I3th century onwards.4 Picture 24 (P1. I8a) which depicts "the delight of the animals at getting out (of the Ark) into the fresh air again" finds an astonishihgly close parallel in the mosaics of S. Marco in Venice (P1. I8b). And to remove from this comparison any stigma of extrava- gance we may add at once that through its elaborate genre-details the remarkable scene in the Egerton Genesis showing the building of the Tower of Babel is most intimately related to another mosaic of the same Genesis cycle in S. Marco.5 To sum up: the search for an explanation of the anomalies has given the following result. Where the Egerton Genesis deviates from the current Gothic iconography, it goes back to, and re- vives, much older traditions, partly Anglo-Saxon, partly late-antique ones. For, the I3th century Genesis mosaics of S. Marco in Venice-to whose iconography we found the Egerton Genesis directly related in several instances-can and has to be taken as a fairly reliable copy of a Late Antique cycle of Genesis-illustrations, a fact which has been firmly established since Tikkanen first compared the S. Marco mosaics with the fragments of the Cotton Bible.6 Further points of contact between the Egerton Genesis and the S. Marco cycle are presented by the following subjects: the -Building of the Ark and the Carrying of the animals into the Ark;7 Abraham bowing before the apparition of the 3 Angels and entertaining them;8 the Drawing of Joseph out of the pit;9 and various others. But all these iconographic parallels are not convincing proof that the Egerton Master derived his inspiration direct from a representative of the late-antique tradition of Genesis illustrations (S. Marco mosaics, Cotton Bible, etc.) rather than through some intermediate channel. 1 James, Illustrations of the Book of Genesis etc., p. 5 ft. 2 Sir I.

This, I think, I am able to demonstrate in at least two instances. The scene in which Joseph's brethren, seated on a hill, see Joseph approaching, is in the Egerton Genesis (picture 130) (P1. I8c) identical in iconography and composition with the representation of the same subject in the S. Marco mosaics (P1. I8d) (3rd cupola of the atrium), except that the whole scene is seen in reverse.1 The way in which, in both cases, the tightly packed group of the brethren is set on top of their cattle leaves no room for doubt of the close relationship of miniature and mosaic (or its model). In the second instance, Pharaoh's dream (picture 143) (P1. I8e), the Egerton Master follows his model verbatim not indeed for the whole composition, but for a very significant part of it, namely the motive of the seven lean cows devouring the seven fat ones. He arranges the animals in such a way that the outlines of their backs form parallel horizontals, one behind the other. But behind, or above, these there are more parallel lines, which are gradually stepped back and slightly undu- lated, suggesting apparently the water from which the animals emerged-"emergebant de flu- mine." In fact, we see the same kind of rippling lines beneath the cows. But why should they be con- tinued above them? We find the explanation in a late-antique original representing the same subject. In the Vienna Genesis the seven couples of cows are all placed in one echelon, one above the other, creating the effect of rows of waves (P1. I8f).2 Since, however, the late-antique illuminator's con- ception was an illusionistic one, the laws of aerial perspective taught him that objects on or near the horizon cannot end with a sharp outline, and he dissolved the uppermost outlines in a vague, hazy strip of colour. This, of course, the English I4th century illuminator was bound to misunder- stand and he interpreted it as the waves of the stream from which, so he read in the Bible text, the cows had emerged. If my observations are correct, it means that the set of illustrations from which the Genesis Master borrowed certain iconographic features of late-antique invention, must have preserved to a high degree the late antique style of the original if indeed it was not itself the original. There is, I think, unmistakable evidence that the Egerton Master knew and employed for his purposes pictorial forms and motives which are peculiar to the world of late-antique painting and illumina- tion. The following are the most patent signs of late-antique stylistic influence in the Egerton Genesis: (I) The abundant use of extreme and often exaggerated fore-shortenings. It is particularly significant how frequently fore-shortened back-views of figures occur (one variety of these is the lost profile).3 There are even attempts at views "di sotto in su" (for instance in the picture of the Tower of Babel) (P1. I9a). (2) The perspective rendering of masses of figures or animals by means of multiple repetition at short intervals of the furthermost outlines. The effect achieved is that of a swarm of closely packed beings. Like the late-antique illuminators our artist succeeds in suggesting the mass of figures or objects as a compact unit instead of merely giving an addition of separate figures. (3) The tree-forms of pine-like or mushroom shape. The design of the trees bears no resemblance either to the western mediaeval formula (which symbolizes the tree by depicting a bouquet of single branches) nor to the Trecento formula (with round, ball-like, summarized tree-tops, but individual foliage). In the Creation of Eve, in the Building of the Ark and in many other scenes the Egerton Genesis adheres to the Trecento formula, but in others again strange T-shaped trees which are strongly reminiscent of the tree-design in the Vienna Genesis make their appearance." It is not so much the fact that in both cases the same southern species of tree might have been the 1 In the Egerton Genesis Joseph approaches from the right instead of from the left. The drawing has faded out in the right-hand corner so that at present the figure of Joseph is hardly discernible. 2 Wickhoff-Hartel, op. cit., Pl. XXXV. 3 On the meaning of the motive of the extreme fore-shorten- ing ("Orthogonalprojection") see K. Rathe, Die Ausdrucks- funktion exfrem verkiirzter Figuren, London, X938. An English forerunner of the fore-shortened back-views of the Egerton Genesis can be seen in the figure below Christ in the Last Judgement of the St. Omer Psalter, which is so strongly reminiscent of the figure of Noah looking upwards to the rain- bow in the Vienna Genesis (Rathe, op. cit., p. 27 ff., fig. 22) and of the figure of St. Peter in the ascension of the Kloster- neuburg retable by Nicolaus of Verdun (Rathe, op. cit., fig. 23)- 4 Compare Wickhoff-Hartel, op. cit., pls. XX, XXXI.</page><page sequence="20">64 OTTO PACHT model that is of importance, but that both try to convey the effect of fore-shortened tree-tops. (4) Finally, strangely contrasting with the use of all these various devices for creating the illusion of depth, the sudden appearance of three-dimensional objects drawn in flat projection. Furniture, beds, tables, etc. are almost regularly represented in this way, often side by side with foreshortened figures and objects.1 As a rule the Middle Ages showed only the front of square objects, perhaps sometimes adding an abbreviated indication of their sides, but in the main eliminating the third dimension. The method of the Egerton Master is quite different. In order to show us the parts meant to be extending into depth, he simply tilts them straight upwards on to the picture-plane. It is as if the objects, or those of their parts which lie behind the picture-plane, were lifted upwards in order to present themselves properly to the spectator. Again I know of no other precedent to this flat unfolding of space except some of the miniatures in the Codex Rossanensis (Last Supper) or in the Vienna Genesis (Pharaoh's Feast, Pharaoh's Dream).2 And here too they exist side by side with specimens of the boldest kind of foreshortenings. It is hardly thinkable that the 14th century English illuminator had any idea of the dignified age from which the set of illustrations came which he had chosen as his model. It is most likely that to our artist the world of non-mediaeval Mediterranean forms, both old and new, appeared as one indistinguishable whole, with a common physiognomy. Out of this foreign world of the old and the new Mediterranean art, however, he has certainly selected the most explicitly illusionistic elements, a fact which gives high credit to his instinct for the future course of artistic evolution. Where could the Egerton Master have acquired the knowledge of the late-antique style of book- painting, in other words, where could he have seen an illuminated Genesis-manuscript, representing the Cotton Bible tradition? In attempting to answer this question we find ourselves on most difficult ground. How much do we know of the survival of classical manuscripts in late mediaeval libraries? Can the acquaintance with an isolated piece of illumination have sufficed to convey to the northern painter the artistic secrets of a distant epoch and a foreign milieu? Or were his eyes opened to the illusionistic values of late-antique miniatures because he had come in contact with the initial phase of a great living movement which aimed at a revival of classical art? With so many uncertain premises our answer must needs be a purely hypothetical one, yet we may gain some indication in what direction a future search for new material-impossible under present conditions-will have to be undertaken in order to lead us to more positive results. Could the Egerton Master have seen a representative of the Cotton Bible tradition in England? The Cotton Bible itself only came to England in the I6th century (from Philippi), but a very similar set of Genesis illustrations must have been known in England as early as the Ioth century. James had already noticed that the two Anglo-Saxon sets of Genesis illustrations, the one contained in the so- called 'Caedmon' MS. of the Bodleian Library (MS. Junius I I), the other in the Anglo-Saxon Hepta- teuch of the British Museum (Cotton MS. Claudius B. IV), derive at least their iconography from a late-antique model of the Cotton Bible type.3 Unfortunately, this question has never been really studied and the miniatures of the Anglo-Saxon Heptateuch have, with a few exceptions, never been published.4 But an examination of the 'Caedmon' MS., of which a complete facsimile edition exists,5 leaves no doubt that the iconography of this Anglo-Saxon Genesis paraphrase is largely based on what we call the Cotton Bible tradition. I quote only two subjects where the correspondence between the Anglo-Saxon MS. and the mosaics of S. Marco (which stand here for the Cotton Bible tradition) is perfect, right down to minor details: the Birth of Abel and the tri- partite story of Noah's drunkenness.6 It is, of course, always convenient to assume a Carolingian intermediary as a link between the Anglo-Saxon miniatures and the late-antique prototype, but there is no actual evidence for it in our case. The situation then would be the following: behind 1 See Pictures 126, 127, 143, etc. 2 A. Haseloff, Codex Purpureus Rossanensis, Berlin-Leipzig, 1898, Pl. V. Wickhoff-Hartel, op. cit., pls.

The Egerton Master, as we have shown before, knew this class of Anglo-Saxon MSS, it is therefore certainly not impossible that he, too, used their model and that it was actually the very same venerable codex which twice at an interval of four centuries gave inspiration to English artists.1 The second place where a set of pictures of the Cotton Bible type has left its imprint on occi- dental art and where, therefore, our artist could have seen the original or an accurate copy, is Venice. The chief witness for its presence in Venice in the I3th century is, of course, the cycle of Genesis mosaics in S. Marco which has taken its entire programme from an early set of illumina- tions.2 That the S. Marco mosaics themselves have served as model to the English illuminator is most unlikely. For although this monumental copy has faithfully kept to the iconographic concept of the ancient Bible chronicle it has preserved little of the late-antique style of painting and hardly anything of its illusionistic refinements. S. Marco could never have taught the English illuminator the effects of foreshortening or aerial perspective. But the prototype of the S. Marco mosaics, the ancient set of illustrations, was still extant in the I4th century and there was, therefore, even then opportunity of seeing and studying it. This is proved by a series of miniatures adorning a manu- script in the Vienna National Library (Cod. 2576).3 Though the text of the Vienna MS. is not the Bible text, but that of a French "Histoire Universelle," the pictures which illustrate this text are noth- ing but an extract from the Cotton Bible cycle (P1. I6c). It is one of those numerous books with French texts which were written and illuminated in the North of Italy throughout the whole of the I4th century. In our case the artistic value of the miniatures in itself is not great, but their documentary importance is unique. For they are a better guide than even S. Marco to the lost archetype. True, the illustrations of the Vienna "Histoire Universelle" contain only a fraction of the Genesis cycle as shown in the S. Marco mosaics-another section of the MS. has pictures illustrating subjects from the classical myth and history, these too seemingly copying antique models-but what there is of the Genesis not only follows, picture by picture, the iconography of the late-antique original as do the S. Marco mosaics, but the Vienna MS. ostensibly also copies its style, which in the S. Marco mosaics is greatly transformed and diluted.4 The Vienna "Histoire Universelle" is certainly recognizable as a 14th century product, its trecentesque qualities, however, are rather an involun- tary than an intentional endowment. These illuminations have a strong Trecento accent, but they try to speak the language of the ancient prototype ; intentionally they are copies, reproducing 1 James, op. cit., p. 22, surmises that St. Augustine's, Canter- bury was the place where most probably "an ancient picture Bible might have found a home." 2 See Demus, op. cit., pp. 53, 98. 3 H. J. Hermann, "Die westeurop. Handsch. u. Inkunabeln d. Gotik u. Ren.," 2. T. Beschr. Verz. d. illum. MSS in Oest. N. F. VII, 2, describes the MS. (No. 46 of the volume) as follows: "Altfranz6sisch. Histoire Universelle. Vermutlich provengalische Arbeit vom Ende des XIV. Jh." But there is nothing in the style of the miniatures-which can best be judged by the opening initial and the border ornam'ent-or in the script that would support this attribution. As for the language of the text, French in Upper Italy in the 14th century is almost as widely used as Italian itself, especially for romances, poetry and even Bible translations. Milan, Verona, Venice, Rimini (Naples in the South) were the main centres where French books were in demand by the nobility and were produced on the spot in great numbers. Since all this must have been present to the mind of a scholar of Hermann's rank, it is not easy to guess on what grounds H. has advanced his Provengal hypothesis. Moreover, some of the figures in the miniatures are labelled with their names in Italian. This and the fact that the ancient codex whose pictures the illumi- nator(s) of the Vienna MS. took as model for his (their) illustrations, was at that time in or near Venice, justify, to- gether with the stylistic evidence, the limitation of our search for the place of origin to Italy. 4 By those miniatures, illustrating Biblical events, Hermann felt reminded of "Early Christian or Carolingian miniatures," without, however, following up these traces or checking his observations. Of the profane illustrations in the Vienna MS. he says "sie verraten eine Vertrautheit des Miniators mit den Illustrationen franzisischer Ritterromane." Again, I feel unable to follow the author of the Vienna Catalogue. As far as the few reproductions allow one to form any considered opinion, even these profane illustrations contain antique pictorial elements to an astonishing degree. Only when the MS. is again accessible will it be possible to ascertain whether the prototype can be reconstructed for the profane section also and whether this prototype was of an equally early date. 5 0. Demus, with whom I had an opportunity of discussing the question of the date of the prototype, thinks that certain Byzantinisms, features such as the drapery formula in the figure of the Creator, would point rather to a Middle Byzan- tine model (Macedonian Renaissance) than to an Early Christian one. It is, of course, impossible to-day, with the few reproductions available, to reach final conclusions on this point; yet, I might be permitted here, while admitting the existence of proper Byzantine features, to suggest another interpretation for them. These Byzantine elements might</page><page sequence="22">66 OTTO PACHT their models as faithfully as it was possible for the Middle Ages to reproduce a work of art created in a different style. A comparison with late-antique originals still extant, such as the Vienna Genesis or the Codex Rossanensis, makes it clear to what an astonishing degree of accuracy this 14th century reproduction attains in some instances. Consequently if we find here and there striking resemblances of motives and forms between the Egerton Genesis and the Vienna "Histoire Universelle," we need not hesitate to interpret this fact as evidence for the close study by the Egerton Master of the late- antique model. So far we have only shown that an English illuminator of the 14th century could have seen the precious set of Genesis illustrations in Venice or Upper Italy. More circumstantial evidence is added to this conjecture by the fact that there is, apart from the Anglo-Saxon-English and the late-antique component, a third constituent in the work of the Egerton Master, namely the style and conception of Italian Trecento painting. We shall have to speak presently of this Italian influence on the style of the Egerton Master, strongly noticeable in many of his compositions and figure-motives, but at this moment it is sufficient to point out that our Master's knowledge of the new Italian art of painting and design is profound, and understandable, therefore, only on the assumption that he had been to Italy itself. The I4th century is a period of transition in the artistic evolution of all European countries except Italy. It bears a double Janus-head, looking towards mediaeval symbolism as well as post- mediaeval realism, and trying simultaneously to unite or reconcile the abstract rhythm of the Northern tradition with the anthropomorphic canon of the re-emerging Mediterranean world. I know of few cases where the problematic character and the complexity of the situation have found so clear and sincere an expression as in the work of the Egerton Master. He offers no synthesis, but uses the most divergent narrative forms, side by side according to the possibilities offered by the subject. In the Egerton Genesis one can, I think, distinguish three different methods of approach to the subject. The first I shall call the 'nominalist representation.' The last scene on folio 4b (P1. I7a) bears the following inscription: "De Cam le filz Noe vint Nemroth sicome dit le mestre destoirs (i.e. Petrus Comestor). Mais Metodie dit sicome mesme le mestre reherce qe cestui Nemroth vint de hiron le filz sem, de le quel sem come dit Alquyn avindrent vint et sept parenties et il oue les siens occupia Asie la tierce partie du siecle." The picture (27) shows a group of people pointing to a giant, Nimrod. Apparently they are quarrelling as to who can claim to be Nimrod's ancestor. That this is the meaning is made clear by the names Hiron and Cam, written above the arguers. In other words, a pure metaphor has been literally translated into visual forms: the rival ancestors themselves come forward to voice their conflicting claims. Another instance of nominalist representation occurs in the scene of Joseph being stripped of his coat by his brethren (Picture I31). The miniature contains the stripping itself, the killing of the kid, and in addition, standing at one side, a great winged dragon. The editor of the manuscript interpreted this strange motive as "the devil inspiring the brothers."1 But I suggest that it can only be interpreted as the literal quotation from the words of the Genesis: "Let us slay him and cast him into some pit and we will say some evil beast has devoured him." The portrayal of metaphors had been used in book-illumination since the early Middle Ages and was a favourite fashion, particularly in Psalter illustration.2 Its greatest example is the Carolingian Utrecht Psalter which came at an early date to Canterbury, and was repeatedly copied there for over three centuries. Far more widely used in our manuscript is a second illustrative method which combines mediaeval and post-mediaeval principles. A good example, and one still somewhat related to the first type of narrative technique is the picture showing Lamech's descendants (pictures I3-I4). Lamech, who was a bigamist, stands in the middle, between his two wives who try to draw his attention in opposite directions where their respective children are busy displaying their inventions. It looks like find their explanation as the workings of the Veneto-Byzantine training of the copyist rather than as the imprint.left by the style of the model. Furthermore, had it been a Middle Byzantine model, it would be hard to understand how the 14th century illuminator could have extracted from it the late- antique elements so perfectly that many of his pictures look rather like reproductions than imitations of late-antique miniatures. 1James, Illustrations etc., p. 36. 2 The German terminus technicus is "Wortillustration."

Jahrhundert, 1938, with bibliography.</page><page sequence="23">A GIOTTESQUE EPISODE IN ENGLISH MEDIAEVAL ART 67 a competition between the two mothers as to whose children deserve the highest praise. At the two sides of the picture we have genre scenes of quite extraordinary realism, linked together by a central group which represents the entirely imaginary dispute of the two women. Thus, the artist presents together as one pictorial unit the dispute and its subject. He pictures a merely theoretical and a real situation simultaneously, fusing two heterogeneous spheres. The dual structure of this type of narrative characterizes better than any other the position of our artist, who stands between two epochs, the one tending to symbolize ideas, the other representing the tangible world. This composite type of narrative has a wide field of application in the Egerton Genesis. Even where the artist seems to follow long established iconographic formulas it is not difficult to discern the dual structure of representation of which we spoke. In the picture of the Tower of Babel (Picture 32) (P1. 19a), for instance, Nimrod, himself a giant, stands in the right-hand corner at the foot of the giant building, addressing a group of people and pointing to the work which is being car- ried out according to his advice and orders. It would be wrong to read this picture as a realistic de- scription of a building-scene with Nimrod inspecting its progress. For, in fact, the picture contains nothing but a verbal translation of the inscription which runs: "Adonques sassemblerent le plus rour du saunk Noe en les chaumps de sennaar et pur doute de fluuie qe porroit apres auenir par looement de Nemroth qi coueita a regner ilz firent la toure babiloigne." We are shown Nimrod expounding his plan and, simultaneously, a pictorial embodiment of this plan. And this, really, is the scheme which runs throughout the manuscript. We see people talking, arguing, communi- cating with each other, and if we follow the signpost of their pointing fingers, we perceive the content of their conversations in material form. In other words, what is in the mind's eye of these people is made outwardly visible to us. The two sections of the representation are sometimes split'off into two separate compartments of the page as in the theme of the quarrelling shepherds of Lot and Abraham (Pictures 46-45). Abraham's shepherds come to their master to complain of the behaviour of Lot's shepherds. They point over the border of the picture to another picture, a landscape scene, a sort of turbulent pastorale, where the rival shepherd-camps are fighting and wrestling. This narrative method of presenting subjects or actions which are only spiritually interrelated, as elements of one and the same scene, is no novelty in mediaeval art. In a mediaeval picture, for instance, we might have God talking to Noah, ordering him to build the Ark, and next to him the Ark would be made visible. Here, however, its value would be that of a symbol, of a sign; there would be no intention of creating a full-sized, sensuous illusion. Herein lies the difference: in our manuscript the Erection of the Tower of Babel, the landscape idyll with the wrestling of the shepherds, are the things themselves, and not their substitutes in the form of abbreviated symbols. This brings us to the third and last type of narrative technique in which the modern tendencies are still more pronounced. Picture 148 (P1. I9b) may be chosen as an example, a scene from the story of Joseph and his brethren. The Bible text describes how Joseph gave a feast to his brothers and how he sat at a separate table, and his brothers also sat by themselves and so did the Egyptians, because the latter might not eat bread with the Hebrews. The remarkable thing about this drawing is not so much the skill with which the illusion of a banqueting scene is created. More important is the way in which the new devices of spatial composition and realistic description are enlisted to illustrate a particular psychological situation. We are given a frontal view of the four Egyptians, whose table-manners seem unrestricted by any notions of etiquette, while the eleven brothers are seen from behind, sitting tightly pressed shoulder to shoulder, like schoolboys on a narrow bench; by this arrangement the trying tension of the atmosphere caused by the social and racial discrimina- tion is made visible. The relationship between the various persons of a scene is no longer, as in the early Gothic, regulated by abstract and general rhythmic principles; nor is the pictorial order an equivalent to the spiritual order which our mind projects into the subject. The aesthetic order and unity come now from within the picture, from the actors themselves, their actions and psychological relations. It is quite clear that Giotto (P1. I9c), who first created this new aesthetic autonomy, is the ultimate source from which our Egerton Master has drawn his inspiration. Many Northern artists of the later I4th century have borrowed from the rich Giottesque repertoire of compositional formulas and figure-motives. But it would be difficult to think of any other English or French</page><page sequence="24">68 OTTO PACHT artist of the 14th century, who has gone so far in understanding the implications of Giotto's novel dramatic narrative. Further eloquent proof of the Italian training of our illuminator is the abundance of detailed stylistic analogies between the Egerton Genesis and Giottesque painting. It is only in the South, from contemporary Italian art, that he could have learnt the secrets of three-dimensional design in figure and space-construction. The block-like figures, with their solid, corporeal forms, so unlike the elongated types of earlier Anglo-Gothic painting with their curved silhouettes, find their parallel in Giotto's monumental world, and again in the sturdy types of North Italians such as Niccolo da Bologna.1 Before some of the more elaborate landscape compositions (Abraham's sacrifice) one is inclined to think of Taddeo Gaddi and other artists of the later Trecento. Particularly well under- stood is the function of the figure-block in the space-composition of the Trecento. Repoussoir- figures, back-views, lost profiles, overlappings repeated in depth, are frequently introduced by the Egerton Master, all designed to lead the spectator's eye away from the picture-plane into the depth and to suggest space. Only one of the major innovations of Trecento painting finds no echo in our manuscript: our artist has never attempted to create the illusion of an interior. Naturally, the monumental art of the South, transplanted to the pages of Northern books, underwent a profound transformation. With the Egerton Genesis, as with translations which keep every word of the original text and yet entirely change its meaning, we have the strange experience that the artist seems in many places to have most faithfully copied his Trecentesque models, and yet to have achieved entirely dissimilar results. I see the explanation for this curious phenomenon above all in the different approach to the art of painting. It is this, I think, which is the determining factor prior to any reaction to a particular style. The function of colour and line is in each case a different one. In the Egerton Genesis one is given plenty of opportunity for studying this point since the illustrations of our picture-book were left in different stages of completion, ranging from coloured miniatures over shaded drawings with tinted backgrounds to merely outline sketches. Now, if one compares one of the finished pictures with one of the outline sketches, one will make the following observation: the finished picture does not add much that is substantial or indispensable to the outline drawing. The line drawing, despite the absence of any modelling, is hardly less suc- cessful than the finished picture in creating the illusion of solid, bodily forms or three-dimensional space. The reason for this surprising fact is this: in the Egerton Genesis lines or curves do not mark the end of a flat surface or describe a linear form. They are always silhouettes of a stereometric world. These contours have no meaning unless we understand them as projections of the plastic values of a solid world on to the flat surface of the page. In cases such as the lost profile or in cases of extreme foreshortening it becomes obvious to everyone that the line on the paper stands as an abbreviated expression for three-dimensional values. As the term itself implies-foreshortened equals abbreviated. The more such abbreviated forms occur, such contours with considerable depth-potential, the less colour, shading or modelling is needed to create the illusion of space. That is why the Egerton Master makes such frequent use of these forms. They enable him to indicate the expanse and shape of the substance by leaving out the substance proper, to draw the outline without telling the whole story. For him, drawing is not, as in the normal sketch, a skeleton design, a rough draft as a guide to the final complete form; it is something like the reduction of painting to its shortest, its simplest expression. Giotto, or his Italian followers, would never have seen in an outline drawing a possible sub- stitute for painting in colour and light and shade. We do not know what a drawing by Giotto may have looked like, but this much we can say: the design of Giottesque figures seldom impresses us by its linear qualities, it is certainly not by their silhouettes that we remember them. In the Egerton Genesis, on the other hand, the contours are the most telling part, even in the finished 1 Striking comparisons between the figures of the Egerton Genesis and Giottesque figures were shown in the Photo- graphic Exhibition of English Art and the Mediterranean, held at the Warburg Institute, London, 1941. See Guide to the Exhibition, p. 50. It is hardly necessary to emphasize that it is in the main monumental painting, the art of the Italian frescoes, which left its imprint on the work of the Egerton Master. Italian book-painting of the Trecento, especially Tuscan illumination, was too feeble and too incomplete an echo of Giotto's monumental conceptions to convey the new ideas to the Northern artist.</page><page sequence="25">20 1a fit'f Oft lagitapfrgill l 0I Pew a Dou-mv 4 oa nus 11 t t f owl V tra l 4mwwmbmll faut siaia aha fr T1 alilIT 111111144411) fit 14 f I's 101 0110)r 110italf Wnt 1af ato t V&amp; lity(111####3fidBS -:::::::::_T ~ l7 4ain tu ta a p ( I........... fata 0011-i i::iii? t~~~itor'i ~gi:" caAim m uti_:i,~~-:::-i:?- :totanexassq d a-Derby Psalter, Bodl.

To treat drawing as a kind of sum- marized painting, to see in contours not mere linear demarcations, but condensed forms which possess the power of suggesting modelled space, this seems to have been a specifically English conception throughout the Middle Ages. And it is not for the first time that full, painterly forms, taken over from a foreign art, have been reduced in England to concise, linear expression. For the Egerton Master the task had become more difficult than it had ever been before. Now they were cubic forms which had to be translated into an antagonistic medium. The traditional expedient of a calligraphic paraphrase of the full-bodied, painterly forms (like those in the Anglo-Saxon and Romanesque Winchester schools) was here not applicable. Renouncing the rhythmic elegance of Gothic design, the Egerton Master establishes a linear system of stereometric simplicity and hereby succeeds in mastering with a minimum of outward forms a world which had been expanded into a new dimension. An unusual undertaking and the unusual personality of the artist combine to make the Egerton Genesis a case of its own. From its analysis we learn much about its foreign sources, but little about its English line of descent. Millar's discovery of a second illuminated MS. by the same hand re- moved all doubts about the English origin of the "enigmatic picture-book"-but only because the new MS., a Psalter, had an English calendar, not because the style of the illuminations contained some clue as to the English school of painting in which it was formed.1 I am able to add a third manuscript to our Master's oeuvre, and this time, I think, we can get a step further and lay bare some threads which connect his work with English 14th century illumination. The new addition to the oeuvre of the Egerton Master is a splendidly decorated Psalter in the Bod- leian Library, Oxford, MS. Rawlinson G. 185 (Pls. 2oa, b, d, 2Ia).2 It contains at the end (fol. I42r) a colophon mentioning the name of the patron who ordered it. The colophon reads: "Frater Stephanus de Derby, prior ecclesie Sancte Trinitatis Dublinie Cathedralis, istud psalterium ordinavit et fieri fecit." Stephanus de Derby was appointed prior of Christchurch in Dublin in 1347 and was still living in 1379. The earliest entry in our manuscript is dated 1374. We can, therefore, safely say that the Bodleian MS. was made in the third quarter of the I4th century. Stephanus de Derby is.portrayed on fol. 2or (P1. 2oa) kneeling outside a large initial with the figure of the enthroned Christ. His emblems appear in the two lower corners of the page; they are golden roses very similar in design to the later Tudor rose. The artist's name is unfortunately not mentioned. The Derby Psalter, as we shall henceforth call the MS., is not a picture-book like the Egerton Genesis. It belongs to a more regular class of illuminated books whose decoration was fixed by convention. All its miniatures, and this time they are paintings, not coloured drawings, are part of a rich scheme of book-decoration, either filling initials or enlivening borders. Most of the more elaborately adorned English Psalters of the i4th century-and the great majority of important illuminated MSS of English origin in the i4th century are Psalters-have this system of decoration. One group of MSS, however, the group of the great East Anglian Psalters, distinguishes itself by the use of a particularly forcible and very characteristic type of ornament, a specific English variety of the Gothic ivy-scroll. It is this group to which the decoration of the Derby Psalter bears the greatest resemblance. The spiky leaves, with undulating surfaces modelled in relief, the robust stalks, the flattening out and straightening of the scrolls, the two-colour scheme of strident blue 1 Brit. Mus. Add. MS. 44949. Millar, The Egerton Genesis and the M. R. James Memorial MS., loc. cit. 2 F. Madan, Summary Catalogue of the Western MSS in the Bodleian Library, III, Oxford, I895, p. 375, No. 14902. Several pages of the Bodleian MS. have been reproduced in colours by John T. Gilbert, National MSS of Ireland, IV, I, London 1882, pls. I-III. Gilbert says p. LXXXIV that "the Psalter was executed towards the middle of the fourteenth century for the Prior of the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity at Dublin," and p. LXXXVI that it "was in the possession of Sir James Ware, the Irish historiographer in the seventeenth century (Catal. of Ware's MSS at Dublin)." On the person- ality of Stephanus de Derby see James Mills, Account Roll of the Priory of the Holy Trinity, Dublin, r337-1346, Dublin, 1891: "He (Robert de Hereford) died 1348, and was succeeded by Stephen de Derby, a canon of the House, who continued to rule' it for more than 30 years." Christ Church, Dublin (Holy Trinity) was "one of the wealthiest and most important of the religious houses of the Anglo-Norman settlers in Ire- land," and our MS. is called by Mills, op. cit., p. XXIV "the most elaborate extant work of Anglo-Norman art in Ireland."</page><page sequence="28">70 OTTO PACHT and red, all that is in the Derby Psalter clearly derived from the East Anglian species of ornament which is so unlike the calligraphic variety of French Gothic scrolls with their elegant penwork. The function of this stiff and heavy ornament is the same in the Derby Psalter and in the East Anglian Psalters: to provide a solid, rectangular frame for the script. A novelty in the Derby Psalter is the introduction of some naturalistic foliage (vine-leaves, grapes, etc.). Other forms are recognizable as offsprings of the East Anglian cabbage leaf. There can be no doubt that the East Anglian Psalters are the ancestors of our Derby Psalter. The figure-style, on the other hand, joins the Derby Psalter to the Egerton Genesis. The very unusual types of human faces-almost negroid features for the younger people (P1. 2ob, c)-are the same in both manuscripts. In both the same skill in forced foreshortenings (the concert of the monks in the Exultate Deo initial is a model combination of the various possibilities of foreshortening), and the same delight in repeated overlapping (the singing monks of the Cantate Domino initial P1. 21 c). In a few cases the artist frees himself from the traditional iconography of English Psalter illustration and shows his great talent for unconventional treatment of his subject. In the traditional iconography Psalm 52 which opens with the words "Dixit insipiens in corde suo, non est Deus," was illustrated either by showing a jester, representing the fool, or the temptation of Christ.1 Our artist gives a more direct pictorial translation of the text (P1. 2 Ib). In his Derby Psalter God speaks from Heaven: "Ecce dicit insipiens." The fool, not dressed as a jester, but apparently characterized as a crass materialist (he has a bag of money in his hand) arguing with a monk says: "Non est Deus" and the monk replies: "Tu mentiris aperte." As far as I can see this representation is unique in the whole of mediaeval Psalter illustration. One figurative element only shows East Anglian remi- niscences: the grotesque caricatures which are near relatives of the monstrous creatures of the Luttrell Psalter. It is still too early to decide from which part of England our artist came. The calendar of the James Memorial MS. seems to point to Durham, the Derby Psalter to Dublin and a fourth manu- script which F. Wormald is adding to our list appears equally to confirm the Northern provenance of the whole group. A new chapter in English painting opens about 1380. The new impulses came chiefly from Flemish and Bohemian art.2 The Italian influence, however, disappeared completely from English painting. While in France the parallel movement gained momentum until it brought French painting into line with the Italian Renaissance, in England the contact with Italy remained an episode. Why, it is difficult to say. The work of the Egerton Master is the only serious attempt to reconcile the inherent English tendency to linear expression, with the Italian conception of an objective world of massive bodily forms. His work deserves to find its place in the history of English art as one of the most ingenious historic experiments. 1 See the iconographic synopsis at the end of G. Haseloff, op. cit., p. 100oo ff.
