<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tobias Dantzig.-Aspects of Science. xi + 285 p. New York, MACMILLAN, 1937 ($ 3.00). This book continues the theme of the author's earlier discussion of number (" Number, the Language of Science," s930, cf. Iss : i6, 455-9), with more direct attention to the part played by mathematics in the conceptual structure of exact science. It undertakes to disestablish, one after the other, the absolutes of classical physics by showing these to rest finally upon a mathematical foundation of convention. " What we call objective reality is in the last analysis what is common to many and could be common to all thinking beings." With this quotation, heading the tenth chapter, the temper of the book is defined. To add to these words of POINCARI the author's own: " the question as to whether there is more to objective truth than mere collective agreement must remain unanswered, inasmuch as we have no other criterion for objective truth than collective agreement." (p. 213). In particular, causal law defines no absolute order, but expresses a pragmatic requirement of prediction. Geometry can give no knowledge of the " absolute " nature of extension, but rests for its generality upon the human intuition of mathematical induction. The assurance that in " real " nature the requirements of mathematical analysis are met i3 no more than the physicist's als ob, his working fiat (p. 92). He assumes that the properties of the mathematical infinite are mirrored in nature (p. 107), and thereupon claims for his knowledge of nature the universality and necessity to be found in his mathematical tool. No absolute method exists for determining which of several alternative geometries is the geometry of the given world, for not even standards of measurement are free from the subjective taint of convention. Rigidity itself is but one more convention (p. I85). Turning from the relativities of space to those of time, we find no better ground for</page><page sequence="2">I56 iSIS, XXIX, I objectivity. The unit of time measurement is fixed by " universal agreement," and the concept of simultaneity rests upon the operationally valid use of light signals. The basic attributes of space and time alike become " anthropomorphic hallucinations." (p. 224). Relativity, thus initiated, pervades the other concepts of mechanics -inertia, force, mass, and energy. The naive realism of classical mechanics is gone. After contemplating, through mathematics, alter- native possible worlds, men " in vain seek to establish the absolute character of their own " and in the end " suspect that their findings might have been prejudiced by their own predilections." (p. 262). Classical physics assumed for man the capacity to make clear the distinction between observer and observed (p. 264), thereby reserving to him the privilege of facing an uncontaminated natural order. This assumption falls. The concepts which were at first read as structures of the independent world are now acknowledged to be insinuations of the structure of the human " collective mind" into nature (p. 246). They are the " collective predilections" of the race (p. 263). They are our " master-instruments," hence not laws of Nature but human " necessities of thought and action." (p. 277). The Kantian note of modem Conceptual Pragmatism is clearly marked. And with it the sceptical confession " that it is inherently impossible to ascertain whether any universe of human discourse possesses objective reality, or is but a fiction created by man's predilections." (p. 279). The theme of the book is amplified by some references to the history of science, and some to theology and the influence of the church. On the whole these latter are unfortunate. We are told of Schoolmen who adopt ARISTOTLE because " his casuistry, his predilection for the static, his aversion for everything that moved, changed, flowed, or evolved admirably suited their purposes." (p. 45). Theology appears in the unattractive, albeit pragmatic, capacity of sedative for the restless will (p. 38, 272). It occurs to ask, after reading, how much better is the offered alternative of a structure of admittedly anthropomorphic hallucinations which we call the categories of science and which we recognize to be born in the human breast of an " ineffable will to permanence." (p. 115). Notice should be drawn to the recurrent mention of an intuition upon which the mathematical analysis of infinity rests, namely " the inalienable conviction that what has been said or done once can ever be repeated." (p. 28, 98). This conviction has no basis either empirical or formal; it is, presumably, a non-rational and a priori intuition. It characterizes human acts in general. In the present discussion it serves the purpose of restricting the claim on the part of reason to be</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS I57 adequate as a basis for the conceptual structure of science. In effect it is equivalent to the proposition that what is possible at all is possible again. Now the question comes to mind whether this is anything more than a statement in special form of the difference between a concept and the perceptual instances of a concept. For a concept is precisely such a thing as can be exemplified again and again, each case being recognized by some sort of human act. Is the non-rational character of this intuition of the indefinite repeatability of human acts really different from that of the relation between the general and the particular which permeates all rationality? If not, why emphasize the non-rational element in such a special form? An answer to this question is in ordel because of the particular doubts which the argument of the book throws upon the adequacy of reason to provide knowledge of nature. (Williams College).
