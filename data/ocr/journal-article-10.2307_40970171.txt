<plain_text><page sequence="1">Literary Modernismo The Ambiguous /x Legacy of / Progress / / GERALD GRAFF jL he rise of the idea of progress from the late seventeenth century provoked an extensive reaction on the part of literary intellectuals. This reaction was complex, but two main aspects stand out - a reaction against rationalism in the sphere of ideas and against bourgeois democracy in the social sphere. The Restricted Possibilities of Literature Insofar as the idea of progress entailed the march of rationality over superstition and received authority, it tended to assign prior- ity to empirically certifiable truth over that claimed by literature. As science gained in prestige, literature was denigrated or patron- ized as a kind of pseudoknowledge, not genuine knowledge at all but a collection of fables, myths, and fantasies which appealed only to the emotions. Francis Bacon, for example, said that poetry subjects "the shews of things to the desires of the mind; whereas reason doth buckle and bow the mind to the nature of things." x It seemed to follow that literature belonged to an infantile stage of historical development before positive knowl- edge had superseded religious and metaphysical superstition. Some representatives of literary culture attempted to maintain that literature was no less "rational" a discipline than science. But as definitions of rationality narrowed, it became more and i Francis Bacon, The Advancement of Learning [1605], in Selected Writings of Francis Bacon, edited by Hugh Dick (New York: Random House, 1955), p. 244.</page><page sequence="2">LITERARY MODERNISM 105 more difficult to hold that science and literature aimed at the same kind of knowledge and truth. By the midnineteenth cen- tury, humanists such as John Stuart Mill were reacting against the positivist denigration of literature, yet in doing so acceding to the attenuated conceptions of literature presupposed by this denigration - 'that it expressed a childish, nonrational, prescien- tific mentality. Mill merely put a higher valuation on this mentality, challenging the notion that to "outgrow" it constituted an unqualified advance toward happiness. Earlier, this sort of challenge had been part of the Rousseauistic indictment of arti- ficial culture for depleting natural vitality and spontaneous cre- ativity. The opposition between science, reason, and objective truth and poetry, myth, and imaginative truth remains a central assumption, entertained by many on both sides of the "two cultures" to the present day. The rationalistic implications of the idea of progress conflicted sharply with the doctrine of an eternal, unchanging order of truths and values that for many centuries had licensed the claims of literature to timelessness and permanent applicability. The view of John Dryden that "mankind is ever the same, and nothing lost out of nature, though every thing is altered" 2 had been until the seventeenth century one of the most solidly established assumptions of literary theory; it has continued to be maintained by humanists down to the present day, but with steadily decreas- ing conviction. What was most subversive and unsettling in rationalism was its tendency to construe reason itself as a purely scientific and value-free method of thought. Regarded by most thoughtful men up to the end of the Renaissance as a support for the eternal ethical, metaphysical, religious, and aesthetic abso- lutes, reason, in its empiricist and Cartesian forms, became in- creasingly viewed as a threat to the survival of these absolutes, undermining not only all received certainties and traditions but, 2 John Dryden, "Preface to Fables Ancient and Modern" [1700], in Of Dramatic Poesy and Other Critical Essays, edited by George Watson (London: Everyman's Library, 1962), II, 285.</page><page sequence="3">106 SOCIAL RESEARCH eventually, the axioms of rationalism as well. Left to progress without check, reason promised to yield up a universe in which the result of all ethical inquiry, as William James was to put it, "could only be one of those indeterminate equations in mathe- matics which end with 0=0," since "this is as far as the reason- ing intellect by itself can go." 3 This was the "universe of death" encountered by many of the romantic writers and their protag- onists - Goethe's Faust, Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, Carlyle's Teufelsdröckh among them. In such a universe, choice and action would be paralyzed, and literature would be deprived of its moral function. A second source of literary reaction against the idea of progress lies in the identification of this idea with the levelling and unsettling effects of bourgeois democracy. Aristocratic ideals of nobility, heroism, and high distinction seemed anachronisms in a bourgeois society. Running through nineteenth-century litera- ture and literary and social criticism is the theme that bourgeois- democratic society is too pedestrian, mundane, and colorless to provide adequate materials for literature, not to mention too much dominated by commercial matters to provide a wide and informed audience. As Alexis de Tocqueville observed around midcentury in Democracy in America, a work which examined the United States as a test case of bourgeois democracy, "Nothing conceivable is so petty, so insipid, so crowded with paltry interests - in one word, so anti-poetic - as the life of a man in the United States." 4 Tocqueville asserted that "the principle of equality, in proportion as it has established itself in the world, has dried up most of the old springs of poetry." 5 William Hazlitt, in an essay of 1815 on the degeneration of comedy, had proposed that the convenience and ease of modern bourgeois life left few s William James, The Varieties of Religious Experience [1901-02] (New York: New American Library, 1958), p. 153. * Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America [1835], translated by Henry Reeve (New York: Random House, 1945), II, 78. » Ibid., II, 77.</page><page sequence="4">LITERARY MODERNISM 107 dramatic possibilities for literature: "Modern manners [Hazlitt wrote] may be compared to a modern stage-coach: our limbs may be a little cramped with the confinement, and we may grow drowsy; but we arrive safe, without any very amusing or very sad accident, at our journey's end." 6 The debasement of artistic standards under democracy was a further source of literary anxiety. Progress appeared synonymous with the disappearance of ancient ideas of craftsmanship. Tocque- ville noted that in a democracy art ceases to be created for a "limited number of fastidious customers" and becomes a mass commodity, a fact which induces the artist to devise shortcuts which "diminish the intrinsic quality of the thing he makes." 7 "When none but the wealthy had watches," Tocqueville com- ments, "they were almost all very good ones; few are now made that are worth much, but everybody has one in his pocket." 8 In The Demon of Progress in the Arts (1954), Wyndham Lewis reached a crescendo of bitterness in describing the decline of quality in virtually all products: We seem to be running down, everywhere in life, to a final end to all good things. Compared to fifty years ago, when the supreme and ultimate rot began, our food - our milk, our cheese, our bread, our concocted foods, everything, in short, is inferior, and there is every reason to suppose that it will get more so, decade by decade. . . . Why? For the very good reason that the word business may be defined as buying cheap and selling dear.9 With the great social convulsions brought on by laissez-faire economy, political revolution, war, and other forces, the anarchic character of bourgeois democracy became a special focus of literary reaction. A deep current of nostalgia runs through the writings of Carlyle, Ruskin, Arnold, Henry Adams, Yeats, Eliot, Pound, Lawrence, Wyndham Lewis, and many others - nostalgia « William Hazlitt, "On Modern Comedy," in Walter J.

In 1900, George Santayana lamented that the history of Western poetry showed a steady decline from the lofty, simple, spontaneous productions of the Homeric age down to the emotional chaos and "imaginative disintegration" of Browning and Whitman, and he traced this decline directly to the loss of intellectual authority, of "rationalizing discipline," that besets a society given over to "material elaboration" and "material science." 10 Ironically, such reactionary sentiments were greatly responsible for the revolution in poetic technique initiated by Pound and Eliot a few years later, for it was these writers' view of bourgeois democracy as a violent chaos which could scarcely be assimilated by traditional literary methods that stimulated them to stylistic innovation. Reviewing Ulysses in 1923, Eliot defended Joyce's radical depar- tures from conventional narrative form as "a step toward making the modern world possible for art." u The merger of philosophical rationalism and bourgeois democ- racy materialized in modern industrial, technological society, the advance of which toward the fulfillment of the autonomous logic of its development came to be identified with the impersonal in- evitability of the historical process itself. From the point of view of Carlyle's Teufelsdröckh, this process appeared to be "one huge, dead, immeasurable Steam-engine, rolling on, in its dead indifference, to grind me limb from limb." 12 Paradoxically, much literary "modernism" arose in revolt against "moderniza- tion," against the menacing, yet apparently irreversible forward progress of the steam engine of history.

The exhaustion of forms and genres has become the object of extensive speculation. The most widely discussed tendency in fiction since World War II is one that has received such labels as "the literature of exhaustion," of "self-parody," of "silence"; this fiction takes the exhaustion of fictional form, narrative, and language itself as its primary subject. Charles Newman points out that a rhetoric of exhaustion, desuetude, and terminality became a convention of criticism during this period: "Language itself was often compared to biological forms of life, subject to decay and waste, yet somehow also tyrannous and corrupting in its enervation. Likewise, genres were subjected to a kind of literary physics - often compared to energy states - and conse- quently subject to reduction, entropy and stasis." 13 At their deepest level, modern literary nostalgia and anxiety over the exhaustion of forms are symptoms of that apocalyptic sense of disappointment with history, tradition, culture, and finally with mind itself which has come to permeate so many areas of contemporary life. In 1925 Ortega y Gasset suggested that "modern Western man bears a rankling grudge against his own historical essence." He seems to be experiencing "something akin to the odium professionis of medieval monks - that aversion, after long years of monastic discipline, against the very rules that had shaped their lives." 14 In this mood of self-hatred, highly 13 Charles Newman, "Death as a Metaphor Is Dead," The New York Times Book Review, July 1, 1973, p. 27. i* José Ortega y Gasset, The Dehumanization of Art and Other Writings on Art and Culture, translated by Helene Weyl (New York: Doubleday, 1956), p. 42.</page><page sequence="7">110 SOCIAL RESEARCH developed intellectuality is subjected to infinite recrimination and contempt by intellectuals, and the birth of self-consciousness is viewed as a kind of original sin. Northrop Frye has described the central romantic "myth of alienation" as a secularization of the Christian myth of the Fall, in which the eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge is explicitly identified with man's awakening to self-conscious reflection. The myth holds that "man has 'fallen/ not so much into sin as into the original sin of self-consciousness, into his present subject-object relation to nature." 15 The contemporary philosopher and critic, E. M. Cio- ran, restates this idea forcefully: Next to the contemporary "maker" with his sufferings and his sterility, the creators of the past seem embarrassingly healthy: they were not made anemic by philosophy. . . . These days no one escapes this exacerbation of the intellect and its corresponding diminution of instinct. The monumental, the spontaneously grandiose is no longer possible. . . . The best thing an artist pro- duces now are his ideas on what he might have done. . . . No age has been so self-conscious. Seen from this point of view, the Renaissance looks barbarous, the Middle Ages prehistoric, and it is only the last century which does not seem a little childish. We know a great deal about ourselves; on the other hand, we are nothing.16 From such assumptions there follows the modern intellectual's frequent envy of primitives, barbarians, children, proletarians, bullfighters, athletes, and other supposed possessors of heightened instinctual energy, an envy which has today become as common a feature of the "radical" as it was once of the "reactionary" style. This attitude reflects the longing to reverse the course of history and restore a prelapsarian state of undiff eren tia ted con- sciousness. is Northrop Frye, A Study of English Romanticism (New York: Random House, 1968), p. 17.

Some literary intellectuals tried to reconcile literary theory with the idea of historical progress. Even those who resisted doing so often betrayed, in indirect fashion, an implicit acceptance of the idea. If, under the influence of rationalism, many critics relegated literature to the sphere of nonrational fantasy, others sought ways to define it as a complementary form of rational inquiry. In Literature Considered in Relation to Social Institutions (1800), Madame de Staël puts forth the thesis that literature partakes of "the universal progress of enlightenment resulting simply from the succession of eras." 17 She therefore judges Greek tragedy "very much inferior to our own modern tragedies, because dramatic ability consists not only of the art of poetry but also of a profound knowledge of the emotions; and in this respect tragedy has had to keep up with the progress of the human mind."18 Given a fresh impetus by the spread of systematic psychological investigation, this argument has reappeared subse- quently in the philosophy of the modernist avant-garde, where it assumes the form of the thesis that successive revolutions in litera- ture and art progressively push forward the frontiers of human consciousness, breaking down the accumulated repressions of the past and bringing ever more obscure and marginal territories of the unconscious to light. The very concept of "experimental" literature suggests an analogy with the research scientist, as does it Germaine de Staël, Madame de Staël on Politics, Literature, and National Character, translated and edited by Morroe Berger (Garden City: Doubleday, 1964), p. 152. is Ibid., p. 161. These views, however, are qualified by Madame de Staël's admis- sion that certain aesthetic qualities tend to be strongest when art is in its infancy. See below, note 65.</page><page sequence="9">112 SOCIAL RESEARCH the increasingly frequent employment - to the point of monotony, in fact - of metaphors of "breakthrough" in assessments of the current literary situation. Similarly, a more sympathetic reaction to the rise of bourgeois democracy on the part of some literary intellectuals can be con- trasted to the hostility of others. The view that democracy leaves no place for heroic action was met by attempts to redefine heroism in ways appropriate to the changed social context. Wordsworth and Browning in England, Cooper, Emerson, Whitman, and Twain in America, are among the nineteenth-century writers who sought to delineate a democratic hero whose manners and actions were sharply in contrast to his aristocratic prototypes. The rise of realistic fiction, which endowed the details of everyday bour- geois life with intense interest, if not with heroic grandeur, was further evidence of the fresh impulse within literary culture to respond positively to the bourgeois revolution. Earlier I quoted Tocqueville's observation that equality had "dried up most of the old springs of poetry." He went on to predict, however, that new springs would arise: I have shown how the ideas of progress and of the indefinite perfectibility of the human race belong to democratic ages. Demo- cratic nations care but little for what has been, but they are haunted by visions of what will be; in this direction their un- bounded imagination grows and dilates beyond all measure. . . . Democracy, which shuts the past against the poet, opens the future before him.19 As Tocqueville well understood, the theory that poetry must deteriorate as democracy spreads presupposed a definition of poetry peculiar to aristocracy: "the search after, and delineation of the ideal," in particular, the idealized presentation of lofty acts by "gods and heroes." 20 Although poetry so defined perishes under democracy, a more realistic kind of poetry, dealing with familiar, universal experiences, is likely, according to Tocque- 19 Tocqueville, Democracy in America, II, 78. 20 ibid., II, 75, 77.</page><page sequence="10">LITERARY MODERNISM 113 ville, to replace it. Even the reactionary modernists, though they regarded mass democracy with a mixture of anxiety and loathing, recognized that retreat to a rigid classicism was inadequate, that traditional forms, if they were to survive at all, would have to be radically transformed in order to meet the changed social cir- cumstances. Even the literary myth of history as a fall into alienating self- consciousness, pessimistic as it certainly is, implies consolations which point toward a kind of historical progress. The very "steril- ity," in Cioran's words, which condemns the romantic and post- romantic writer to inferiority to his "embarrassingly healthy" fore- bears is but an aspect of the qualities in which he surpasses them - complexity of vision, awareness of the ironies and ramifications of experience. If historical self-consciousness entails a fall from the remembered grace of prereflective unity of being, it is in a sense a fortunate fall - fortunate not in resurrecting the fallen into contentment and wholeness, but rather in conferring on their suffering a kind of privileged historical authenticity. Cioran obviously envies the "childish" naivete of the men of the Renais- sance and the Middle Ages; but he just as obviously regards his own viewpoint as superior to theirs. Like Hegel's "world-his- torical individuals," to whom it is given to know "the necessary next stage of their world, to make it their own aim and put all their energy into it," 21 the exemplary avant-garde sensibility sacrifices personal happiness for a privileged intimacy with the Spirit of the Age. Reduced to its essential structure, the concept of history as a fall into self-consciousness reveals itself as a restatement, in ago- nized terms, of the progressive concept of history as a continuous extension of the frontiers of knowledge. The fall itself is equiva- lent to progress as viewed through the eyes of those who regret it or, more accurately, regard it with ambivalence. This may shed light on the typically paradoxical public relations of the artistic 21 G. W. F. Hegel, Reason in History, translated by Robert S.

Even the self-mockery of Dada and contempo- rary "anti-art," in which artistic energy is devoted to ridiculing all the "serious" pretensions traditionally made for art, betrays a claim to an amplified consciousness that goes beyond ("tran- scends," in the jargon of the trade) any previously attained stage. Though the serene unity of classical artists is denied him, the modern artist, with all his irony and self-mockery, surpasses them by annexing territories of awareness to which they were oblivious. Historical authenticity and advanced psychological insight, then, are the ambiguous consolations of the legacy of progress. In one critical respect, of course, the authority of progressive thought has waned. The classic exponents of the idea of progress were confident of the validity of the ends they ascribed to history and of the standards of perfection by which they thought they could measure the stages of evolution. The modern literary mind - and increasingly that of society as a whole - has lost this confidence. Retaining the view of history as an inevitable and irreversible process, but suspicious of the apparent goals to which the process is leading, modern intellectuals seem to have absorbed the grim lesson that history is a monster, yet a monster which it is naive to think can be diverted from its course. Hegelians with- out any sustaining vision of an Absolute Idea, our contemporary world-historical individuals can feel only a mixture of pride and anxiety over their position on the advance margin of modernity. Dryden and Dr. Johnson As early as the great seventeenth-century literary debate be- tween the ancients and the moderns - which Comte credited with first giving the idea of continuous progress "scientific consistency" and "public regard" 22 - we can find evidence of equivocal, two- 22 Quoted in Sidney Pollard, The Idea of Progress: History and Society (New York: Basic Books, 1968), p. 12.</page><page sequence="12">LITERARY MODERNISM 115 sided reactions within literary culture to progressive thought. John Dryden (1631-1700) is the first major English critic to express a recognizably modern historical consciousness, though it does not in Dryden displace traditional patterns of thinking but exists alongside and in conflict with them; he is the first to show the combination of mixed pride and regret at the contemplation of his situation as a modern. Dryden's "Essay of Dramatic Poesy" (1668) treats the ancients- vs.-moderns controversy and the related debate between admirers of English and French drama. On the whole, Dryden aligns him- self (through his spokesman Neander) with the moderns and the English, endorsing the freer, more flexible drama of Shakespeare, which unabashedly mixes tragic and comic elements in disregard of the ancient "rules," over the more formally correct but creatively less adventurous French drama, which Dryden charges with "nar- rowness of imagination" and "servile" imitation of ancient mod- els.23 In defending modern English literature, however, Dryden does not hold that it represents any progressive advance over the ancients. He assigns this progressive view to his character Eugenius, who employs the standard "moderns* " analogy between art and natural science: "if natural causes be more known now than in the time of Aristotle, because more studied, it follows that poesy and other arts may, with the same pains, arrive still nearer to perfection." 24 Dryden's own view is more complex than either Eugenius's or that of his opposite number, Crites, who is made to speak for the superiority of the ancients. In a sense, Dryden suggests, the ancients and the moderns are not compara- ble, for "the genius of every age is different." 25 The radical implications of this thesis become clear when Dryden enters into a defense of the use of rhymed verse in the drama against the argument that blank verse, such as Shakespeare and the Elizabethan dramatists favored, is the appropriate me- 23 John Dryden, "An Essay of Dramatic Poesy," in Bate, Criticism, p. 148. 24 Ibid., p. 135. 25 Ibid., p. 157.</page><page sequence="13">116 SOCIAL RESEARCH dium. In itself a question of little intrinsic interest ito us, it prompts Dryden to exhibit some of the typical critical tendencies of his period. In part, Dryden's defense of rhyme rests on old- fashioned critical principles: rhyme, he argues, falls properly within the canons of "decorum" which govern "serious plays." 26 But Dryden goes further and draws on a principle of discontinuity between the generations to justify himself: It is to raise envy to the living, to compare them with the dead. They are honoured, and almost adored by us, as they deserve; neither do I know any so presumptuous of themselves as to con- tend with them. Yet give me leave to say thus much, without injury to their ashes; that not only we shall never equal them, but they could never equal themselves, were they to rise and write again. We acknowledge them our fathers in wit; but they have ruined their estates themselves, before they came to their children's hands. There is scarce an humour, a character, or any kind of plot, which they have not used. All comes sullied or wasted to us; and were they to entertain this age, they could not now make so plenteous treatments out of such decayed fortunes. This therefore will be a good argument to us, either not to write at all, or to attempt some other way.27 The fact that Shakespeare and his contemporaries excelled in one kind of drama is not only no argument for our present-day writers' continuing in their path but, if anything, an argument against it, since the previous exploitation of a literary convention exhausts it. Were the Elizabethans to be transplanted into the present period, they could no longer write as "Elizabethans." The energies available to them no longer exist. Earlier, when Dryden had defended modern literature against the partisans of the ancients and the French neoclassicists, he had claimed Shake- speare as a modern. But in comparing Shakespeare with the dramatists of his own day, it becomes apparent that in this rela- tion Shakespeare is an ancient, and a rather remote ancient at that, for the genius of the age which formed him cannot be recovered. Dryden elaborates on this view of historical change by intro- 2« ibid. 27 ibid., pp. 156-157.</page><page sequence="14">LITERARY MODERNISM 117 ducing a concept of progress. Advances in refinement have been made: "this way of writing in verse [i.e., rhyme] they [the Eliza- bethans] have only left free to us; our age is arrived to a per- fection in it, which they never knew; and which . . . 'tis probable they never could have reached." 28 The idea that Restoration poets had perfected the art of English verse over the roughhewn efforts of the medieval and Elizabethan ages was a commonplace of this period. But it was becoming equally a commonplace that these advances in refinement had been paid for by a loss of creative energy and emotional power. Dryden repeatedly makes this point by citing Homer and Virgil as classic prototypes of "genius" and "correctness." In "A Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of Satire" (1693), Dryden sees the history of English satire as recapitulating the development in epic writing from Homer to Virgil, the literary refinements in each instance reflecting the advance from a barbarous to a civilized condition of society. "Has not Virgil changed the manners of Homer's heroes in his Aeneisi Certainly he has, and for the better. For Virgil's age was more civilized, and better bred; and he writ according to the politeness of Rome, under the reign of Augustus Caesar, not to the rudeness of Agamemnon's age, or the times of Homer." 29 Correspondingly, Dryden suggests that the satires of John Donne would "appear more charming if he had taken care of his words, and of his numbers," 30 that is, if he had had the advantage of later advances in diction and versification. On the other hand, Dryden acknowledges Donne's superiority to later poets in "wit." The final judgment, again, is complex: "I may safely say it of this present age, that if we are not so great wits as Donne, yet certainly we are better poets." 31 Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) employs the same sort of ana- 28 ibid., p. 157. 2» John Dryden, "A Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of Satire," ibid., p. 144. bo ibid. ai Ibid.</page><page sequence="15">118 SOCIAL RESEARCH logical scheme in his "Life of Pope," where Johnson poses in acute form the problem of the exhaustibility of literary forms. "It will be found in the progress of learning/* Johnson says, "that in all nations the first writers are simple, and that every age improves in elegance," 32 but this elegance brings a diminution in "sublimity." This idea had become so much a commonplace by Dr. Johnson's time that he could parody it in a satire on a coffeehouse literary critic and platitudinarian, "Dick Minim." 88 Nevertheless, it was not a commonplace Dr. Johnson was pre- pared to dismiss. Of Pope's attempt to translate Homer, Johnson observes that the result "exhibits no resemblance of the original and characteristic manner of the father of poetry, as it wants his awful simplicity, his artless grandeur, his unaffected majesty." 34 Pope's failings in this respect are excusable, Johnson says, when understood in the context of the historical periods in which Homer and Pope wrote - just as Dryden had appealed to changed historical contexts in defending his use of rhyme. "In estimating this translation," Johnson says, consideration must be had of the nature of our language, the form of our metre, and above all of the change which two thousand years have made in the modes of life and the habits of thought. Virgil wrote in a language of the same general fabric with that of Homer, in verses of the same measure, and in an age nearer to Homer's time by eighteen hundred years, yet he found, even then, the state of the world so much altered, and the demand for elegance so much increased, that mere nature would be endured no longer, and perhaps, in the multitude of borrowed passages, very few can be shown which he has not embellished.35 If even Virgil could not recover the Homeric spirit, how could Pope be expected to do so? "One refinement always makes way 32 Samuel Johnson, "Life of Pope," in Lives of the Poets [1779-81] (New York: Dolphin Books, n.d.), p. 253. 33 "Minim was able to tell, in very proper phrases, . . . that a perfect writer is not to be expected, because genius decays as judgment increases" (Idler, 60 [June 9, 1759], in Samuel Johnson, Rasselas, Poems, and Selected Prose, edited by Bertrand Bronson [New York: Rinehart, 1958], pp. 182-183). 34 Johnson, Lives of the Poets, p. 253. s» ibid.</page><page sequence="16">LITERARY MODERNISM 119 for another; and what was expedient to Virgil was necessary to Pope." 36 In Dr. Johnson's view, Pope's poetry is a kind of ultimate case of the progress of artificial elegance, beyond which it is neither possible nor desirable to go. "New sentiments and new images others may produce; but to attempt any further im- provement of versification will be dangerous. Art and diligence have now done their best, and what shall be added will be the effort of tedious toil and needless curiosity." 37 Its sense of itself as a period in which formal correctness had arrived at a kind of perfection, but at the expense of energy and vitality, is a salient feature of the historical consciousness of the neoclassical age. It is a commonplace of Shakespeare criticism in the eighteenth century that Shakespeare ought not to be blamed too severely for the defects in his plays - bawdy dialogue, lapses from decorum in diction, equivocal morality, rough versi- fication - because he wrote in a semibarbarous age and was forced to compromise with its rudimentary taste. Dr. Johnson, for instance, says that "the English nation, in the time of Shakespeare, was yet struggling to emerge from barbarity." 38 When neo- classical correctness came under attack from the point of view of a newly developing taste for the wild and the primitive, this theory of the "barbaric" nature of Shakespeare and his age was turned on its head and cited as a proof of the inferiority of eighteenth-century writers: What are the lays of artful Addison, Coldly correct, to Shakespeare's warblings wild? 39 Such condemnations of eighteenth-century overrefinement, how- ever, said nothing that had not already been said in eighteenth- century critics' own partly apologetic defenses of their age. 36 Ibid. 37 ibid., p. 260. 38 Johnson, "Preface to Shakespeare," in Rasselas, Poems, and Selected Prose, p. 258. 39 Joseph Warton, "The Enthusiast: Or, the Lover of Nature" [1744], in Louis I.

If they sometimes arrived at an acute sense of the irreversibility of historical changes, it must be remembered that both believed in the essential changelessness of mankind and "Nature" and in what Johnson called those "general and transcen- dental truths, which will always be the same." 40 Their historical sense is a complex, not always very consistent mixture of old and new styles of thought. Thus when they cite historical analogies to illustrate the progress of literature from early vitality to later elegance, their thinking is not always truly historical; Homer and Virgil are treated as eternal prototypes, symbolic of an unchanging antithesis between Energy and Discipline, Nature and Art, that can be found in all periods of history. And their belief in the deterioration of literary vitality from early to later periods owes something to the ancient belief in the degeneration of the world from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, in the uses they make of these ideas, Dryden and Johnson do anticipate the more com- plex historical sense of the modern age. With their sense that progressive refinement in "art" results in a corresponding loss of "nature," that Homeric naivete can never be regained once history has progressed to a certain point, that the movement of history is irreversible, we are on the road to the later sense of disparity between "anemic" moderns and "embarrassingly healthy" ancients. Their self-consciousness of themselves as ir- revocably moderns, with all the mixed hope and anxiety that consciousness entails, points toward the romantic period. Schiller and Hegel In Friedrich Schiller's Naive and Sentimental Poetry (1795), the conflict which Dryden and Dr. Johnson exemplify in a vague and inchoate way is defined and analyzed, and its implications are brought out into the open. It is unfortunate that nineteenth- 40 Johnson, Rasselas [17591, in Rasselas, Poems, and Selected Prose, p. 528.</page><page sequence="18">LITERARY MODERNISM 121 century critics of romanticism did not pay more attention to Schiller; had they done so, twentieth-century literary history might have been spared the confusion that has resulted from the popular characterization of romantic artists as unself-con- scious skylarks, spontaneously emitting profuse strains of unpre- meditated art. This myth - which a number of the romantics, of course, encouraged - was taken at face value by the Victorians, who, whether they approved or disapproved, made it the basis of their characterization. Matthew Arnold complained that the English romantic poets "had plenty of energy, plenty of creative force/' but they "did not know enough." John Stuart Mill, experiencing an emotional crisis as a result of an excessive pursuit of "analytic habits," found recovery through what he felt to be the pure, untroubled emotionality of Wordsworth's verse. This erroneous characterization, absorbed uncritically by Eliot, T. E. Hulme, and others, became part of the counterromantic reaction of first-generation modernism. A reading of Schiller's essay cor- rects this error. Schiller (1759-1805) perceived that the problem of romantic writers (for which his term "sentimental" is equivalent) is not that they do not know enough but that they know too much - that Mill's problem, overdeveloped self-consciousness, is their peculiar problem.41 Having inherited the fruits of a long process of civilization, modern writers, according to Schiller, have lost the unconscious sense of unity with the objective world that animated "naive" artists before them, preeminently the ancient Greeks. The sentimental poet dwells on describing and eulogiz- ing nature precisely because he longs for the harmonious oneness with it that he feels he has lost. Schiller sums this up in a compact formula: the naive poet is nature, the sentimental poet seeks nature. Unable to attain what they seek, modern poets 4i On this theme, see Geoffrey Hartman, "Romanticism and 'Anti-Self-Conscious- ness,' " in Harold Bloom, ed., Romanticism and Consciousness: Essays in Criticism (New York: W.

Schiller says that as man passes from naive oneness with nature to detachment from it, his unity with himself is also fatally im- paired. In the former state, "sense and reason, passive and active faculties, are not separated in their activities, still less do they stand in conflict with one another." 43 This unity of feeling and thought vanishes as man becomes civilized: Once man has passed into the state of civilization and art has laid her hand upon him, that sensuous harmony in him is with- drawn, and he can now express himself only as a moral unity, i.e., as striving after unity. The correspondence between his feeling and thought which in his first condition actually took place, exists now only ideally; it is no longer within him, but outside of him, as an idea still to be realized, no longer as a fact in his life.44 The unity of being which the naive poet had experienced and expressed becomes for the modern poet "only an idea," and "the representation of the ideal" becomes the main function of poetry.45 Ancient poetry, Schiller says, is sensuous and concrete; modern poetry moves us by ideas, which lead us toward the infinite. The apparent pessimism of Schiller's formulations is negated by his overriding commitment to a progressive concept of history. The progress of advancing intellectualization, Schiller says, will eventually lead man back toward unity: the "path taken by the modern poets is ... that along which man in general, the indi- 42 Friedrich von Schiller, Naive and Sentimental Poetry, translated by Julius A. Elias (New York: Frederick Ungar, 1966), p. 106. 43/6id., p. 111. 44 Ibid. Schiller adds: "The sentimental poet is ... always involved with two conflicting representations and perceptions - with actuality as a limit and with his idea as infinitude; and the mixed feelings that he excites will always testify to this dual source" (ibid., p. 116). **Ibid., p. 112.</page><page sequence="20">LITERARY MODERNISM 123 vidual as well as the race, must pass. Nature sets him at one with himself, art divides and cleaves him in two, through the ideal he returns to unity." 46 Schiller adds that "because the ideal is an infinitude to which he never attains, the civilized man can never become perfect in his own wise, while the natural man can in his." 47 But this advantage of the natural man is no mark of superiority; the unity he achieved was purely passive, and was possible only because his field was limited. In searching for perfection in the infinite, the moderns have set themselves a more difficult and higher goal. Only the modern man is capable of progress, and "insofar as the ultimate object of mankind is not otherwise to be attained than by that progress, and man cannot progress other than by civilizing himself, . . . there cannot there- fore be any question to which of the two the advantage accrues with reference to that object." 48 Accordingly, Schiller suggests that "one should not compare ancient with modern - naive with sentimental - poets either at all, or only by reference to some higher concept common to both," 40 that is, in reference to "the idea of humanity" in the totality of its development, by which test the moderns would be found superior. If one abstracts the definition of poetry only from the example of the ancients, "nothing is easier, but nothing also more trivial, than to deprecate the moderns by comparison." 50 Finally, Schiller concludes that the ancients tend to excel the moderns in the concrete and sensuous aspects of art, the moderns reversing the superiority in "whatever in the work of art is called spirit/' 51 This means that the ancients excel in the plastic arts, since the medium of these arts is concrete and finite. "In plastic art works the modern is little aided by his superiority in ideas." 52 In poetry, however, 4« ibid. ^Ibid., pp. 112-113. 48 Ibid., p. 113. 49 Ibid. so ¡bid., pp. 113-114. si Ibid., p. 115. 52 ibid.</page><page sequence="21">124 SOCIAL RESEARCH which emphasizes ideas over sensuous forms, the moderns recover the advantage.53 Schiller's ability to give expression to both the nostalgic and the progressive or optimistic attitude toward the evolution of his- torical self-consciousness marks him, in my view, as a precursor of the tortured and ambivalent postures found throughout literary modernism. Schiller expresses both views with great power. He describes that pervasive mood of his age which had begun to regard "the prerogative of our reason as a curse and an evil": Then we see in irrational nature only a happier sister who remained in our mother's house, out of which we impetuously fled abroad in the arrogance of our freedom. With painful nos- talgia we yearn to return as soon as we have begun to experience the pressure of civilization and hear in the remote lands of art our mother's tender voice. As long as we were children of nature merely, we enjoyed happiness and perfection; we became free, and lost both. Thence arises a dual and very unequal longing for nature, a longing for her happiness, a longing for her perfection.54 But there is no going back; history cannot be reversed: "That nature which you envy in the irrational is worthy of no respect, no longing. It lies behind you, and must lie eternally behind you. Abandoned by the ladder that supported you, no other choice now lies open to you, but with free consciousness and will to grasp the law, or fall without hope of rescue into a bottomless pit." 55 For Schiller, the progress of the arts entails a disintegration of unity, but eventually its recovery - or the approach to its recovery - through the pursuit of the ideal. For G. W. F. Hegel (1770-1831), who derived much of the framework of his aesthetic philosophy from Schiller, art similarly undergoes a disintegration of unity as it becomes progressively more idealized, but this dis- integration eventuates in the predicted extinction of art. Hegel describes the history of art as a passage through three major 53 ibid. e* Ibid., p. 100 55 Ibid., p. 101.</page><page sequence="22">LITERARY MODERNISM 125 stages of the history of the Idea or Spirit. In the most primitive stage, that of "symbolic" or allegorical art (of which the art of the Orient is his chief example), the Idea is both incompletely developed and only arbitrarily related to the concrete form of the art work. Abstract content is not organically fused with form, but is superimposed upon it, "as when a lion is understood to symbolize strength." 56 In the second stage, the "classical," Hegel sees art as attaining "the highest excellence of which the sensuous embodiment of art is capable." 57 Greek sculpture, which incarnates God as man, achieves the perfect material form for embodying the highest religious idea which has yet evolved. Form and content here perfectly coalesce. The third stage, roman- tic art, "annuls the completed union of the Idea and its reality." 58 In romantic art, self-consciousness and subjectivity are so over- developed that the limits of sensuous presentation are exceeded. The Idea has evolved to a point at which it can no longer be represented in sensuous form; henceforth, it can be expressed adequately only by means of philosophy and religion. The ad- vancement of Spirit thus exposes the fatal defect to which art is prone by virtue of its sensuous form; art "accepts for its object Spirit, the notion of which is infinite concrete universality, under the guise of sensuously concrete form." 59 Thus romantic art, which represents a progressive advance over classical art from the point of view of the evolution of the Idea, represents a decline from the point of view of artistic value. Romantic art reinstates at a higher level the disparity between content and form "which remained unovercome in symbolic art." 60 Romantic art gen- erates a content which goes beyond the boundaries of art and thus betokens art's obsolescence. "Romantic art must be regarded 56 G. W. F. Hegel, "The Philosophy of Fine Art," in Albert Hofstader and Richard Kuhns, eds., Philosophies of Art and Beauty (New York: Random House, 1964), p. 431. 57 Ibid., p. 434. 58 Ibid. 59 ibid. 60 ¡bid.</page><page sequence="23">126 SOCIAL RESEARCH as art transcending itself, albeit within the boundary of its own province, and in the form of art itself." 61 The view that art is inferior to abstract forms of thought is as old as Plato, but Hegel restates it in terms of a modern conscious- ness of history. Hegel saw the increasing tendency toward ab- straction, subjectivity, and critical reflection in modern culture, a trend seen, he suggests, in the increasing importance of the science of aesthetics itself. In a critical and reflective age, the ancient, worshipful attitude toward art must pass away, along with anthropomorphic and magical religion: Above all it is the prevailing spirit of our modern world, or, more strictly, of our religion and our intellectual culture, which have passed beyond the point at which art is the highest mode under which the absolute is brought home to human consciousness. The type peculiar to art-production and its products fails any longer to satisfy man's highest need. We are beyond the stage of reverence for works of art as divine and objects deserving our worship. The impression they produce is one of a more reflective kind, and the emotions which they arouse require a higher test and a further verification. Thought and reflection have taken their flight above fine art.62 As Erich Heller says, "both Hegel's Classical and Romantic art emerge from his metaphysics as sentenced to death by the very law of the Spirit." Heller adds: To put the Hegelian dialectic, so fatal to the history of art, as succinctly as possible: Classical art could not last because it was in contradiction to the true idea of the Spirit; and Romantic art was doomed because it was in contradiction to the true idea of art, and thus was driving inevitably toward the consummation of the death it had carried within itself from the very beginning.63 Hegel thus gives a pessimistic turn - from the point of view of the future of the arts - to Schiller's view that art becomes pro- gressively more ideal and intellectual: "art is, and remains for us, 6i Ibid., p. 435. 62/ftid., p. 391. es Erich Heller, The Artist's Journey into the Interior and Other Essays (New York: Random House, 1965), p. 115.</page><page sequence="24">LITERARY MODERNISM 127 on the side of its highest possibilities, a thing of the past. ... it has further lost its genuine truth and life, and is rather trans- ported to our world of ideas than is able to maintain its former necessity and its superior place in reality." 64 Schiller and Hegel appreciate the equivocal position of art in an age of progressive self-consciousness, anticipating the twentieth-century crisis of the arts. Antirealism and the Romantic Revolt against History In the face of historical philosophies like those of Schiller, Hegel, and other romantics, the doctrine of the timeless, trans- historical nature of literature continued to be defended with dogged persistence by many romantic critics. Confronting the advance of the idea of progress, romantic criticism resorted as a strategy to the distinction between antithetical realms of being, the scientific and rational vs. the ethical, religious, and aesthetic. This distinction permitted beleaguered humanists to concede the validity of the progressive thesis while neutralizing the threat it presented to the arts. Accordingly, it was held that whereas science is progressive, cumulative, and subject to revision and correction as new discoveries supersede what had previously been known, art, religion, and morality - the three, often, are not sharply differentiated - are permanent and unchanging. In "Why the Arts Are Not Progressive" (1814), William Hazlitt writes: "What is mechanical, reducible to rule, or capable of demonstra- tion, is progressive, and admits of gradual improvement: what is not mechanical or definite, but depends on genius, taste, and feeling, very soon becomes stationary or retrograde, and loses more than it gains by transfusion." 65 The arts, Hazlitt says, e* Hegel, "The Philosophy of Fine Art," p. 392. «s William Hazlitt, "Why the Arts Are Not Progressive," in Bate, Criticism, p. 292. Madame de Staël's progressive view of literature, referred to above, rests on the assumption that literature is a form of "scientific" knowledge. But she acknowledges that in those aspects of literature which do not depend on in-</page><page sequence="25">128 SOCIAL RESEARCH "hold immediate communication with nature, and are only de- rived from that source"; 60 thus they do not gain by example and accumulation, and must always be wary of the rigidification which sets in when artists begin to pay more attention to following conventions than to making immediate contact with nature. Thomas De Quincey, in "The Literature of Knowledge and the Literature of Power" (1848), gives a vivid restatement of these ideas: "A good steam-engine is properly superseded by a better. But one lovely pastoral valley is not superseded by another, nor a statue of Praxiteles by a statue of Michael Angelo." 67 These statements illustrate the way in which the doctrine of art's timelessness, which had traditionally been licensed by an appeal to rational universais, could be defended within the con- text of romantic organicism. Art was held to be permanent and unchanging by an analogy with organic nature - a precarious analogy, since organic nature may equally be characterized as a process of change and dynamism. Unlike the rational formulas of science, which are "about" objects and thus at one remove from them, organic nature possesses the self-evident, unquestion- able reality of physical forces. By defining art in a way that makes it as absolute as a green valley or a thundershower, this aesthetic places art beyond history. Since the romantic period, many writers have turned against mimetic, representational, and rational conceptions of literary form and moved toward organic form, metaphor, and nondiscur- sive symbol. Concurrently, and seemingly in reaction against tellectual knowledge - i.e., "imagination" and "beauty" - literature does not pro- gress: poetry reaches "with the very first impetus ... a certain kind of beauty that cannot be surpassed. Whereas in the cumulative sciences the latest stage is the most wonderful of all, the power of the imagination is the keener as its exercise is fresher" (Staël, Madame de Staël on Politics, Literature, and National Character, p. 155). Madame de StaèTs assumptions are thus not far different from Hazlitt's, and her attitude toward historical progress, as it affects literature, is ambivalent. «« Hazlitt, "Why the Arts Are Not Progressive," p. 292. «7 Thomas De Quincey, "The Literature of Knowledge and the Literature of Power," in Schorer, Criticism, p. 475.</page><page sequence="26">LITERARY MODERNISM 129 this trend, an aesthetic of "realism" developed, particularly in connection with the emergence of the novel. Both antirealism - as the former of these tendencies may be called - and realism constitute revolutionary departures from traditional artistic meth- ods, and both tendencies reflect modern historical consciousness. In general literary realism has aligned itself with the progressive side of this consciousness - as it does even today, when the tradi- tions of realism receive their staunchest defense from certain Marxist critics. Antirealism has expressed the negative aspects of this historical consciousness, the revolt against progress. In- creasingly, all "linear" forms of writing - logical exposition in lyric poetry, conventional plot and narrative in fiction, rational sequence in the drama - have become associated in the literary mind with the steam engine of history and its grinding deter- minism.68 As Joseph Frank has pointed out in a suggestive essay on "Spa- tial Form in Modern Literature," modernists such as Joyce, Eliot, Proust, and Pound were in search of a "technique for transcending time." 6Ö To accomplish this, it was necessary "to overcome the inherent consecutiveness of language," which naturally tends toward sequence and logic, and to frustrate "the reader's normal expectation of a sequence, . . . forcing him to perceive the ele- ments of the poem as juxtaposed in space rather than unrolling in time." 70 The result is a series of works composed of juxtaposi- 68 In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, realism, which expressed the new bourgeois sensibility in opposition to that of the aristocracy, was the "revolu- tionary" aesthetic, whereas antirealism was "reactionary." In the twentieth century, with the total disappearance of aristocratic values and the establishment of the bourgeoisie, realism has become identified with reaction, while antirealism is embraced by celebrants of the New Sensibility. Thus a considerable reshuffling in literary politics has taken place, one that makes labels like "conservative" and "radical" very confusing. Marxists, dedicated to realism, are regarded as cultural reactionaries, while aestheticism, formerly an aristocratic position, takes on "demo- cratic" credentials. See my essay "Aestheticism and Cultural Politics," Social Research, XL (Summer 1973), 311-343. e» Joseph Frank, "Spatial Form in Modern Literature," in Schorer, Criticism, p. 385. to Ibid., p. 382.</page><page sequence="27">130 SOCIAL RESEARCH tions of images or scenes, juxtapositions which are meant to be held in the mind simultaneously by the reader, just as the viewer of a painting simultaneously apprehends the elements of the canvas. In "The Waste Land," for example, "syntactical sequence is given up for a structure depending on the perception of rela- tionships between disconnected word-groups. To be properly understood, these word-groups must be juxtaposed with one an- other and perceived simultaneously; . . . while they follow one another in time, their meaning does not depend on this temporal relationship." 71 Since many of the word-groups in the poem are quotations from authors in disparate periods of history, their juxtaposition and intermingling fuses past and present, thus again effecting the transcendence of historical sequence. By this juxta- position of past and present, Frank observes, history becomes unhistorical: it is no longer seen as an objective, causal progression in time, with distinctly marked-out differences between each period, but is sensed as a continuum in which dis- tinctions between past and present are obliterated. Just as the dimension of depth has vanished from the plastic arts, so the dimension of depth has vanished from history as it forms the content of these works: past and present are seen spatially, locked in a timeless unity which, while it may accentuate surface differ- ences, eliminates any feeling of historical sequence by the very act of juxtaposition. The objective historical imagination, on which modern man has prided himself, and which he has cul- tivated so carefully since the Renaissance, is transformed by these writers into the mythical imagination for which historical time does not exist - the imagination that sees the actions and events of a particular time merely as the bodying forth of eternal pro- totypes. These prototypes are created by transmuting the time- world of history into the timeless world of myth.72 Little needs to be added to this excellent statement, except the qualification that in the very act of repudiating "the objective his- torical imagination" and its idea of a progressive movement in history the modernist writers in question reveal themselves as its heirs - their quest to transcend history shows their sense of im- 7i Ibid., p. 383. 72 ibid., p. 392.</page><page sequence="28">LITERARY MODERNISM 131 mersion in it, their obsession with fusing past and present shows how acutely they feel their disinheritance from the past. If their works represent the triumph of the "mythical imagination," it is a qualified and partial triumph, one that never wholly overcomes the sense of "the time-world of history" and resolves the dramatic tension. Moreover, as I suggested earlier, the very existence of literary modernism, with its cult of avant-garde experimentation and innovation, is intricately tied up with the dynamism of mass industrial society and with this society's intense concern with identifying itself with the forwardmost wave of the Zeitgeist. Though it often turns its back on history, progress, and the Enlightenment, literary modernism retains a contradictory, am- bivalent kinship with these forces - at once their child and their orphan. The Passing of the Avant-Garde I have tried to suggest that the idea of progress has profoundly shaped the thinking of literary intellectuals even where they have bitterly resisted and attacked it. The myth of the avant-garde, in which the artist is defined as a spiritual adventurer on the fron- tiers of consciousness and thus dedicated to transcending all previous art, long ago replaced the idea of the artist as one who masters a stable craft, the discipline and technique of which are fixed by tradition, principle, and the very structure of nature. This avant-garde myth persists today. Richard Gilman, in an appreciation of Susan Sontag, defines the necessary attributes of the avant-garde critic: "to be able to discern what is actually coming to be born, to distinguish it from the stillborn, to welcome it, extend it its validations in public consciousness, and, most basic and necessary assistance, make room for it by pushing aside, metaphorically at least, what in the form of dead bodies has been taking up all the space." 73 Insofar as rhetoric is significant 73 Richard Gilman, The Confusion of Realms (New York: Random House, 1969), pp. 29-30.</page><page sequence="29">132 SOCIAL RESEARCH here - and I think it is - it is notable that vitalistic criteria - birth, death, life, etc. - have entirely displaced older categories of value based on the intrinsic merit of the object. What matters for avant-garde criticism is not the artistic and moral substance of the work, measured against some reasonable standard, but the relation of the work to the Zeitgeist, a relation which will deter- mine whether the work is "alive" or "dead." Similarly, the correctness of a critical argument or judgment is measured not by its logical and rational plausibility, but by its conformity with the spirit of the new. To be merely "wrong" is an anachronism in an age in which moral discourse has been superseded by his- torical discourse; one is now "dead," an accusation all the more devastating since it renders argument irrelevant. Recently there has arisen a growing sense that the myth of the avant-garde has hardened into stereotyped formulas which betray the very values of originality and spontaneity they invoke. The antimoral rhetoric increasingly appears to be a mere mode of intimidation; the sense of advanced modernity, which the great literary modernists experienced with painful struggle and am- bivalence, seems often today little more than a mode of self- congratulation - and an excuse for disregarding the past. And so much stress has for so long been put on the primacy of the new that the new has at last come to seem routine. As Irving Howe argues in Decline of the New: "By now the search for the 'new,' often reduced to a trivializing of form and matter, has become the predictable old. . . . Alienation has been transformed from a serious and revolutionary concept into a motif of mass culture, and the content of modernism into the decor of kitsch/' Yet this decline, Howe adds, is celebrated as a breakthrough, an assump- tion which rests "on a Philistine version of the theory of progress in the arts: all must keep changing, and change signifies a reali- zation of progress." 74 Veneration for the new, a traditional characteristic of American 74 Irving Howe, Decline of the New (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1970), p. 259.</page><page sequence="30">LITERARY MODERNISM 133 society, has in the twentieth century become even more pervasive as many of the older sources of resistance to cultural innovation have all but disappeared. Decades of avant-garde polemic on the one hand, and a deterioration of confidence in political, eco- nomic, and social institutions on the other, have weakened the old-fashioned Philistine's will to resist. Meanwhile, a new middle- class Philistinism, its tastes formed by media publicity rather than the traditional bourgeois moral ethos, indiscriminately culti- vates new art and aesthetic fashions as a badge of status. As Howe's statement suggests, the "decline of the new" is one aspect of a more general vulgarization of the key concepts of modernist literary culture - alienation, authenticity, Angst, the quest for identity, the fragmented modern consciousness, the Abyss, the Void, etc. Having been so often reduced to a handful of easily consumed textbook formulas, these concepts have lost much of their originally subversive and shocking impact. The extensive proliferation in the last few decades of criticism on modernist and "postmodernist" literature and the greatly ex- panded study of these subjects in the schools and universities has contributed to the domestication of avant-garde concepts. Sometimes almost a parody of the Hegelian progress of self-con- sciousness realizing itself in history, the academic monopolization of contemporary literature and literary culture (the Idea realizing itself in syllabuses, grade reports, degrees, publications, and pro- motions) induces a self-deprecating irony into the attitude of many academic literary intellectuals toward their work. If gestures and styles that were once conceived in fury and anguish and spiritual intransigence seem destined to end - along with so much else - as topics for discussion in midterms, then it becomes im- possible to think about such gestures and styles in quite the same way. Some intellectuals, in the face of these developments, argue that the genuine contemporary avant-garde should not be con- fused with fashionable vulgarizations of it. It is not the artist's or critic's fault, so the argument runs, if his works are appreciated</page><page sequence="31">134 SOCIAL RESEARCH in a superficial way or if his quest for transcendence and original- ity is vulgarized, either by the mass media or the academic pub- lishing and degree mills. This defense misses the point. The validity of the fresh and the original is not in question. The question is what counts as new, fresh, and original when these qualities have through long use become associated with certain predictable affectations and postures? Once the very idea of the sanctity of the new has been corrupted through its co-optation by a novelty-worshipping mass society or its subjection to academic routine, then literary and intellectual culture cannot go on ap- pealing to this idea as before, as if nothing had happened to it. The logic of historical consciousness itself forbids such a response. The very historical consciousness which ushered in the myth of the avant-garde now points toward the obsolescence of this myth, which arose as a reaction against a culturally intransigent bour- geoisie that no longer exists. In the light of recent changes in culture, an ironic, skeptical, critical attitude toward the cult of the new would seem to represent a more truly advanced his- torical attitude. Certain trends in contemporary literature bear out this argu- ment. One of the liberating features shared in common by the otherwise very different recent fiction of Saul Bellow and Donald Barthelme is the comic and satiric energy which these writers direct against the now overworked intellectual baggage of avant- garde modernism: alienation, the abyss, wasteland anomie, exis- tential angst, and "the triumph of the therapeutic" social type, with his ubiquitous psychological explanations of what is wrong with him. In Bellow's Herzog and Mr. Sammler's Planet, "aliena- tion" is a cant term of false "explainers," intellectual parasites who exploit the fashionableness of their unearned despair for purposes of self-glorification and advancement. In many of the stories of Barthelme, modish alienation is properly trivialized by being attributed to some of the more fragile heroes of American popular culture: Batman and Robin, Snow White, and King Kong. In a story entitled "The Party," King Kong, we are told,</page><page sequence="32">LITERARY MODERNISM 135 "is now an adjunct professor of art history at Rutgers/' and if he still occasionally performs feats of terror, "he is simply trying to make himself interesting." 75 Barthelme's novel Snow White is a kind of Babbitt brought up to date for an age of middle-class alienation. In this novel, parody of the jargon of psychology, aesthetics, education, political and cultural radicalism, and exis- tential philosophy fulfills much the same function, in terms of social satire, as Lewis's parody of the jargon of business and civic boosterism. The moralistic verses of Lewis's poetaster, "Chum" Frink, give way to Barthelme's parodie use of quotations from Kierkegaard, Eliot, and Malcolm Lowry, whose anguish seems now almost as popular as the pieties of Edgar Guest once were. Such recent writing suggests a turning point, not necessarily a termination, in the history of the idea of progress in the arts. This idea, carried on in our sense of history as a continuous, linear extension of self-consciousness, is not likely to disappear. But the specific content and terms of the idea, it would seem to me, are undergoing radical transformation - and need to. A critical reserve toward the cult of the new and the doctrine of avant- garde revolution may be, in the present context, the most new, radical, and progressive attitude one may adopt. 75 Donald Barthelme, "The Party," in Sadness (New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1972), p. 58.</page></plain_text>
