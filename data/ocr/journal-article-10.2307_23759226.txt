(Photograph by the author) Oxtotitlán Paintings 4 (Fig. 8c), 6 (Fig. 8b), 10 (Fig. 8a), and 11 (Fig. 8d). First, both groups share a similar rectangular design even though they differ markedly in terms of scale and the medium upon which the design was executed. Second, the La Venta monuments and the Oxtotitlán rock paintings are struc turally similar in that they consist of at least two sections. The basal sections consist of geometric elements and linear de signs; while the upper sections contain anthropomorphic attributes akin to those of a human face. Third, both groups seem to share similar iconographic elements in terms of these anthropomorphic faces, including rounded designs on the upper portion of the face, a fanged mouth, and rounded rectangular eyes. Based on these correspondences with the iconography of the Oxtotitlán rock paintings, it can be inferred that the paintings, like the celtiform stelae of La Venta, were associated with a deity identified by Karl Taube (1996) as the "Olmec" maize god. At La Venta, the position of the stelae Negative hand prints such as this one are ubiquitous within the center of the site and surrounded by residential features of rock art throughout the world and have been found mounds has been interpreted to mean that the stelae formed previously at Oxtotitlán (i.e. Painting 2 in Grove 1970b:18). partofaritual stage in which theideologicalbasesofrulership, Thus, although Grove (1970b) considers the entire corpus of in terms of agricultural cycles and fertility, were enacted rock paintings to date to the Middle Formative period, the through public ritual (Reilly 1999,2002).

(Photograph by the author) The new rock paintings discovered at Oxtotitlán may help archaeologists open new vistas into the constitution of elite identities in eastern Guerrero. The apparent chronological placement of Paintings 10 and 11 within the Middle Formative period, moreover, suggests that iconographic and contextual comparisons with Olmec-style art in other parts of ancient Mesoamerica can provide a useful framework with which to interpret the significance of these enigmatic forms of rock art. Two such interpretations were outlined in this brief report and linked four of the rock paintings of Oxtotitlán to ritual practices which associated rulership with the iconography of maize. Although far from complete, these intriguing hypotheses will be the focus of my future research into the painted caves of eastern Guerrero. Fig. 6. Oxtotitlán Painting 4. (Photograph by the author) Fig. 7. Oxtotitlán Painting 12. (Photograph by the author) Notes 1. The observations described in this paper were made during a visit to Oxtotitlán cave in January of 2010. This investigation formed part of a long-term dissertation project intended to examine the role that Olmec-style rock art played in the development of socio political complexity in Formative Mesoamerica. My research in eastern Guerrero was made possible by a mini-grant from the Teaching Center at Onondaga Community College. The results of my 2010 field research in the painted caves of eastern Guerrero will appear in other publications. 2. Grove (1970b:20-21) considers Paintings 4 and 6 to have glyph-like attributes, although he does not describe either painting in great detail. He did, however, suggest a possible iconographic similarity between Painting 6 and Classic period Venus symbols as well as depictions of rain gods. Fig. 8.

Resumen: Tres nuevos pinturas rupestres de la cueva de Oxtotitlán: Durante un reconocimiento del arte rupestre Olmeca en la cueva de Oxtotitlán en 2010, tres pinturas rupestres previamente indocumentadas fueron descubiertas. Este breve informe describe las pinturas y proporciona dibujos escalados para facilitar el estudio futuro. Una comparación con los estelas celtiformes de La Venta y los estelas Olmecas de la Costa del Pacífico sugieren una afiliación fuerte entre la iconografía del maíz y las nociones del poder en Oxtotitlán durante el período formativo medio. Zusammenfassuno: Im Rahmen einer Exploration von Felskunst im olmekischen Stil wurden im Januar 2010 in der Höhle von Oxtotitlán drei zuvor unbekannte Felsmalereien entdeckt. Sie werden hier zusammen mit maßstabgetreuen Zeichnungen präsentiert. Der Vergleich mit den Stelen von La Venta und den Stelen olmekischen Stils von der Pazifikküste deutet auf eine Verbindung zur Mais- und Herrschaftsikonographie während der mittleren formativen Periode hin.</page></plain_text>
