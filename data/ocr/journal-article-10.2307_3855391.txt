<plain_text><page sequence="1">(105) BRIEF COMMUNICATIONS The Writing of the Name Hi/ke'. Second Note IN JEA xxiv, 128, I published a note on the above-mentioned subject, calling attention to the fact that the god's name, from the Twenty-first Dynasty onwards, was usually written with the sign _, which presumably thereby acquired a new phonetic value in addition to its customary value of p4. So far as I am aware, no explanation has been offered as to how the sign - came to play this new role, and the object of this further note is to suggest one. Many years ago Francesco Rossi, pub- lished a description, with a lithographic plate, of an interesting funerary papyrus in the Turin Museum, which belongs to the large class of pictorial papyri that came into vogue in the Twenty- first Dynasty, consisting of pictures (with or without short texts) borrowed from the Book of the Dead, the Books the Underworld, and other compositions, and of which papyri many different types are known. In this particular papyrus the principal picture represents the boat of the nocturnal sun-god towed along a river by four jackals.2 The god icent whin the usualre naos in thee centre of te boat, and three divinities stand before the naos and two behind it. The names of the three gods in front are written above their headsh, (2) Khopri, and (3) name damaged, but apparently containing the sign (not Osiris, however). The two gods at the back of the boat are labelled respectively 0 and L - 'front' and 'rear'. The opposition of these two signs appears to me significant, and my suggestion is that the artist who executed this papyrus had before him a draft with directions and annotations to serve as a model for drawing this and similar scenes upon coffins, papyri, or the walls of tombs. We may therefore suppose that such a draft directed that the three named gods should be inserted in front of the naos, and that two others should be placed behind it. As the two gods usually associated in such scenes are Sia' and Hike',3 it is further presumed that directions were given in the draft to place the former before the latter and that their names or pictures in the model were accompanied by the directions l and a to indicate their relative positions. I suggest, therefore, that the mark, which was originally no more than a draughtsman's indicator of position, was mistaken for and thus became equivalent to the actual name or emblem of Hike'. I am aware, in making this suggestion, that the logic of the situation would also postu- late the writing &gt; for the name of Sia', but I have never met with such a form. In P. Ch.-B. ix, 6. 9, Sia' is said to be 'in front of (t ?) the bark of Re&lt;', but no significance can be attached to this, as the name of Sia' comes in the middle of a long list of other gods similarly described. W. R. DAWSON Atti della Reale Acad. delle Scienze di Torino, xiv, 1203-24 (1879). A poorly drawn copy is also in Lanzone, Diz. Mitologia, pis. 255-6. 2 Before Dyn. XXI the boat is towed by men or by anthropomorphic gods (e.g. Sarcophagus of Sethos I, and the many pictures in the Tombs of the Kings), but thereafter these human figures are sometimes replaced by jackals (e.g. B.M. Coffin 22900 and others of Dyn. XXI). Cf. also the mention in the Chess-game text (P. Cairo 58037, 3, 3) ofp j^9I ly ) . aThe Turin duplicate of this text is damaged, but had a similar reading, 3J t i 9X (3, 4-4, i). The third copy of this text, that in Theban Tomb No. 359, ends before this point is reached. 3 In the Book of Gates, Sia' and Hike' are usually the only attendant gods in the boat, S. invariably before and H. invariably behind the naos (e.g. Bonomi-Sharpe, Alabaster Sarcophagus, pls. 3, 4, 5, 7, and often; Davis, Tomb of Harmhabi, pls. 49, 58, 59, etc.).
