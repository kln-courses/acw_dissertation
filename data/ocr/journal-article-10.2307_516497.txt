<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAUCER COMPROMISING NATURE By HUGH WHITE 'NATURA omnis, in quantum natura est, bona est.'l Augustine's dictum neatly articulates the philosophical position that lies behind many of the references to the idea of Nature in medieval literature. The natural is commonly seen as a norm against which human behaviour can be judged. A goddess Nature appears, a figure of beneficent creativity, the ordered harmony of whose disposition of the physical realm would extend, were man to permit it, to the moral sphere as well.2 However, another strain in medieval thought about nature understands the natural as not necessarily good, indeed as something which may conduce to vice.3 Whilst Chaucer certainly employs nature terms in a normative capacity,4 when he is most engaged with the idea of the natural he seems to display a scepticism about the normative status of the natural and, indeed, about the goodness of the order Nature superintends. In several of his works Chaucer makes this scepticism apparent by offering a view of Nature which asserts the goodness and rightness of the natural and then suggesting that this view does not fit the reality the work in question presents. I want first to consider two passages, from the Manciple's Tale and the Squire's Tale, in which Chaucer, though not introducing an apparently authoritative Nature and then asking awkward questions of it, does stand on its head the idea of the natural as good and right presented to him by his source, Boethius' Consolation. Chaucer translates Boethius as follows: It liketh me to schewe by subtil soong, with slakke and delytable sown of strenges, how that Nature, myghty, enclyneth and flytteth the governementz 1 The idea is recurrent in Augustine. See, e.g., De Libero Arbitrio, iii. 13 (PL xxxii. 1289); De .atura Boni, 1, 17 (PL xlii. 551,556). 2 The De Planctu Xaturae of Alan of Lille is perhaps the locus classicus for this figure. For this work I refer to the edition by N. Haring, Studi Medievali, 19 (1978), 797-879. 3 The Fall has affected man's nature in such a way that sin can now be seen as endemic to it (see, e.g., Augustine's De Libero Arbitrio, iii. 19 (PL xxxii. 1297)). In A Preface to Chaucer (Princeton, 1962), 398, D. W. Robertson suggests that it is this fallen nature of man that lies behind uses of the idea of nature in which Nature promotes evil, but in the literature which seems closest to Chaucer (e.g. the Roman de la Rose and Confessio .nantis) moral dubiety in Nature seems to be connected with her presidence over instinct, which can conflict with reason. 4 See, e.g., Canterbury Tales, ii. 88, vi. 485,903; Troilus and Criseyde, iii. 1438.

(Boece, iii, metrum 2, 1-31) In the next prosa Boethius draws the parallel with men whose 'naturel entencioun' leads them towards the 'verray good'. So the context as well as the celebration of Nature with which the passage opens (cf. ii, metrum 8) shows that the creatures' return to nature is to be conceived positively: the natural is the proper mode of activity. Boethius' positive conception of the natural is encapsulated in a later passage: 'Thanne is ther nothyng,' quod sche [Philosophy] 'that kepith his nature, that enforceth hym to gon ayen God.' 'No,' quod I. (Boece, iii, prosa 12, 102-5) Chaucer's Manciple takes a very different view of the natural, as his version of the Boethian passage shows: But God it woot, ther may no man embrace As to destreyne a thyng which that nature Hath natureelly set in a creature. Taak any bryd, and put it in a cage, And do al thyn entente and thy corage To fostre it tendrely with mete and drynke Of alle deyntees that thou kanst bithynke, And keep it al so clenly as thou may, Although his cage of gold be never so gay, Yet hath this brid, by twenty thousand foold, Levere in a forest that is rude and coold, Goon ete wormes and swich wrecchednesse.

Lo, heere hath lust his dominacioun, And appetit fleemeth discrecioun. (CT ix. 160-82) The Manciple subjoins a further (unBoethian) example from the animal world before making the connection with mankind: A she-wolf hath also a vileyns kynde. The lewedeste wolf that she may fynde, Or leest of reputacioun, wol she take, In tyme whan hir lust to han a make. Alle thise ensamples speke I by thise men That ben untrewe, and nothyng by wommen. For men han evere a likerous appetit On lower thyng to parfourne hire delit Than on hire wyves, be they never so faire, Ne never so trewe, ne so debonaire. Flessh is so newefangel, with meschaunce, That we ne konne in nothyng han plesaunce That sowneth into vertu any while. (CT ix. 183-95) The addition of the rather unattractive she-wolf and her unpleasant behaviour is only the most obvious means through which Chaucer transforms Boethius' drift and inverts his sense of the natural. In Boethius a lion nobly shakes off the chains of captivity on tasting blood. This magnificent beast has been turned into the domestic cat indulging a dubious appetite for vermin. Again, Chaucer omits the pleasing detail of how the freed bird 'siluas dulci uoce susurrat', stresses the attractiveness of life in captivity, calls the forest 'rude and coold', and adds the loaded 'Goon ete wormes and swich wrecched- nesse', so that the action of the bird does not appear as a triumphant return to her proper way of life, but as the satisfaction of a misplaced and uncontrolled lust (a word which permits an association of the bird's behaviour with the debased activity of men to which it is made parallel) which is, however, conceived as natural. The Manciple sees the operation within man of what Boethius called the naturalis intentio ('naturel entencioun')5 as something that pulls him down 5 For the naturalis intentio as something which impels to the good see, besides the passage mentioned above (Consolatio, iii, prosa 3, 1 ff.), iii, prosa 12, 86 ff. and iv, prosa 2, 134 ff. 159</page><page sequence="4">rather than raising him heavenwards. In this perspective Nature does not appear beneficent in her provision for mankind. Knowledge of the Boethian source may permit us to condemn and reject the Manciple's transformation of it as an expression of a warped, embittered view of human nature. But if we do so, we may be behaving rather as Phebus does in the tale the Manciple tells. Phebus spurns the Crow only for telling a truth he would rather not hear, and which, indeed, he tries to claim is a falsehood. Unfortunately, there is much to be said for the Manciple's unflattering view of humanity; our fallen nature does have a tendency to disobey the voice of reason. Perhaps we should seek no ironic point in the Manciple's confron- tation with an authority here, and allow that his idea of nature is a legitimate one, inciting those who can recognize the source of its phrasing to ask questions of the more optimistic Boethian view. Chaucer subjects the same passage from Boethius to a similar reversal in the Squire's Tale (and the repetition of the procedure might indicate Chaucer's interest in the way in which certain evi- dences for Boethian optimism are capable of being enlisted on the opposite side). Canacee's hawk speaks of the bird who has jilted her: I trowe he hadde thilke text in mynde, That 'alle thyng, repeirynge to his kynde, Gladeth hymself;' thus seyn men, as I gesse. Men loven of propre kynde newefangelnesse, As briddes doon that men in cages fede. For though thou nyght and day take of hem hede, And strawe hir cage faire and softe as silk, And yeve hem sugre, hony, breed and milk, Yet right anon as that his dore is uppe He with his feet wol spurne adoun his cuppe, And to the wode he wole and wormes ete; So newefangel been they of hire mete, And loven novelries of propre kynde, No gentillesse of blood ne may hem bynde. (CT v. 607-20) As in the Manciple's Tale the emphasis is on the perversity of the bird's action, and 'kynde' drags down rather than elevates. 'Gentil' blood is unable to refine raw nature, which is accordingly shown to be very much the lowest common denominator in the constitution of individuals. We may again wonder how much a knowledge of 'thilke text' should affect our reading of this passage. Certainly, in her situation Canacee's hawk is likely to take a jaundiced view, and might be felt to be using her text in somewhat dubious fashion (the escaping bird only somewhat awkwardly exemplifies 'newefangelnesse'). But it 160 WHITE</page><page sequence="5">CHAUCER COMPROMISING NATURE is quite possible that we should take her to be voicing, if perhaps in a rather overwrought manner, a by no means unreasonable opinion. I turn now to works in which we seem to be invited to watch the modification of an initially favourable presentation of Nature. At the beginning of The Book of the Duchess the narrator's sorrowful sleeplessness is said to be contrary to nature: And wel ye woot, agaynes kynde Hyt were to lyven in thys wyse, For nature wolde nat suffyse To noon erthly creature Nat longe tyme to endure Withoute slep and be in sorwe. And I ne may, ne nyght ne morwe, Slepe; and thus melancolye And drede I have for to dye. (16-24) The 'nature' of line 18 should probably be understood as 'natural vigour'.6 One has a certain amount of natural vigour, and when one acts in such a way as to threaten to exhaust one's endowment, one may be said to be acting against the order of nature, 'agaynes kynde'. Though this might be understood simply as a breach of the physical order of nature, the phrase 'agaynes kynde' often carries a moral resonance and is very likely to do so here.7 The Knight's extreme sorrow is also felt to be unnatural: Hit was gret wonder that Nature Myght suffre any creature To have such sorwe and be not ded. (467-9)8 Pan's reaction to this sorrow may well point to the Knight's culpability for such unnatural behaviour: 6 This is not a meaning recognized in A Chaucer Glossary, ed. N. Davis (Oxford, 1978), but Alan of Lille gives calor naturalis as one of the definitions of natura in his Distinctiones (PL ccx. 871). Behind both the Chaucerian and Alanian usages lies the Stoic use of physis to mean the power within an individual concerned with growth and nutrition. See also The Book of the Duchess, 715-16. 7 In Melibee Chaucer shows himself aware of the Ciceronian censure of sorrow as unnatural. The passage links dread of death and sorrow, just as melancolye is linked to fear of dying in the passage from The Book of the Duchess: 'And Tullius seith that "no sorwe, ne no drede of deeth, ne no thyng that may falle unto a man, I is so muchel agayns nature as a man to encressen his owene profit to the harm of another man . . . "' (CT vii. 1585-6). But it may rather be the traditional association of Nature with mesure that calls forth the designation 'unnatural' for the extreme sorrows of The Book of the Duchess. (At BD 866ff. Nature is said to make White's eyes open and close 'by mesure'.) 8 See also BD 715-16. 161</page><page sequence="6">So, throgh hys sorwe and hevy thoght, Made hym that he herde me noght; For he had wel nygh lost hys mynde, Thogh Pan, that men clepeth god of kynde, Were for his sorwes never so wroth. (509-13)9 The poem's concern with the relation of extreme sorrow to the order of nature may explain the reference to the law of kinde when Chaucer introduces the story of Seys and Alcyone: And in this bok were written fables That clerkes had in olde tyme, And other poetes, put in rime To rede and for to be in minde, While men loved the lawe of kinde. (52-6) The suggestion appears to be that the story of Seys and Alcyone was written to promote love of the law of kinde, which could here be understood as a directly moral law, or as the natural order of things, acceptance (love) of which, including the inevitability of death, is a moral duty.10 On either understanding Alcyone's extreme grief can be seen as 'agaynes kynde'. 9 Certain critics, however, see Pan as sympathetic to the Knight, and therefore, presumably, as 'wroth' on the Knight's behalf. See, e.g., E. T. Donaldson (ed.), Chaucer's Poetry (New York, 1958), 952-3. One wonders in what way Pan is to be understood as the 'god of kynde'. Chaucer may mean kynde here to have reference to a non-human, or not specifically human realm, Pan presiding over certain processes which take place in that realm and to which human grief stands opposed. (At C'onfessio Arnantis, iii. 2580ff. man shares kynde with the animals, whilst at Cinkante Balades, L. 12f. 'les choses qe sont natural' stand in opposition to 'celles qe sont d'omme resonal'.) Or it may be particularly the vegetative processes associated with kynde (see n. 6 above) over which Pan is thought to preside, these processes perhaps operating unproblematically in the non-human world in which the Knight's grief is set. Pan may be angry because the Knight is allowed to suffer in a way which puts his physical well-being at risk. But, as will become apparent below, such anger might bring Pan into conflict with the Nature who permits the Knight's sorrow. If this were so, the question as to the way in which Pan is 'god of kynde' would become more pressing, and we might wonder whether 'that men clepeth' does not invite some scepticism about the designation. 10 The point of the reference to the law of kinde might, however, be to stress the paganness of the Seys and Alcyone story in a covert directing of the attention to the Christian hope of resurrection to bliss. A Christian context might be thought to make the situation of the Knight crucially different from that of Alcyone. But the absence of explicit reference to an after-life in the poem then seems rather strange. Again, it is possible to take the reference to the law of kinde as a way of indicating that the exemplary marital devotion of Seys and Alcyone is in accordance with the law of nature; see Helen Phillips (ed.), The Book of the Duchess (Durham and St Andrews, 1982), 143, and John M. Fyler, Chaucer and Ovid (New Haven and London, 1979), 71. I suggest below that it may be possible to regard Alcyone's death from grief as a working out of the law of kinde. 162 WHITE</page><page sequence="7">CHAUCER COMPROMISING NATURE 163 Against the unremitting griefs of the humans in the poem are set the rhythms of the earth. The anthropomorphic language in the following passage requires us to make the comparison. The earth had forgete the povertee That wynter, thorgh hys colde morwes, Had mad hyt suffre, and his sorwes; All was forgeten, and that was sene, For al the woode was waxen grene; Swetnesse of dew had mad hyt waxe. (410-15) The suffering of winter turns, for the earth, to the joy of spring. We are, I think, invited to feel that this ought to happen with human grief also. The non-human world, perfectly expressive, no doubt, of Nature's will,11 is offered as a norm by which we may judge the human mourners and find their sorrow excessive, and in that excess unnatural. 12 But such a judgement may seem, on reflection, inappropriate, ill-attuned to the reality of intense sorrow. The pun on 'hert-huntyng' at lines 1312-13 links the Dreamer's attempts to ease the Knight's heart with the pursuit of the herte, and if, as appears to be the case, the herte escapes,13 we may have an indication that the Dreamer is also unsuccessful, a failure pointing to the inefficacy of consolatory pieties and moral exhortation in the face of human grief. Certainly, the Dreamer finds it impossible to continue his consolatory endeavour in the face of an unadorned statement of the Knight's position: 'Bethenke how I seyde here-beforn, "Thow wost ful lytel what thow menest; I have lost more than thow wenest." God wot, alias! Ryght that was she!' 'Allas, sir, how? What may that be?' 'She ys ded!' 'Nay!' 'Yis, be my trouthe!' 'Is that youre los? Be God, hyt ys routhe!' And with that word ryght anoon 'l Cf. De Planctu Naturae, viii. 10ff. 12 For the poem seen as recommending a 'natural' equanimity or moderation in grief see L. V. Sadler, 'Chaucer's Book of the Duchess and the "lawe of kynde"', Annuale Mediaevale, 11 (1970), 51-64, and Duncan Harris and Nancy L. Steffen, 'The Other Side of the Garden: An Interpretive Comparison of Chaucer's Book of the Duchess and Spenser's Daphnaida', Journal of Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 8 (1978), 17-36. 13 See BD 380-6. At 539-41 the Dreamer suggests that the hart has escaped. We next hear of the hunt's conclusion. R. A. Shoaf, 'Stalking the Sorrowful H(e)art: Penitential Lore and the Hunt Scene in Chaucer's The Book of the Duchess', JEGP 78 (1979), 313-24, claims that the hunt is successful, citing in support (p. 320) 0.

(1304-13) The Dreamer's bafflement may constitute the poem's acknowl- edgement of the propriety of the Knight's inconsolable grief.14 The fact is that whilst an annual cycle transforms the earth, for man there is no cyclic regeneration, and this is liable to make the way in which he experiences sorrow very different from what goes on in the regenerable natural world.15 The parallel the poem offers between human and non-human ('natural') looks from this perspective rather unconvincing, the anthropomorphism involved misleading. The alienation of the Knight from his surroundings may express not so much a temporary and remediable state of affairs as a profound difference between the nature of two kinds of thing. If this is so, one wonders to what extent man is under the jurisdiction of Nature, how binding upon him 'natural' imperatives are. It may be that Nature and Pan do not preside over man's whole being. The idea of nature in the poem is often of a power concerned with the healthy functioning of man as a physical organism,16 yet it is perhaps a property of man's nature considered whole that its suscep- tibility to emotional stress can come into conflict with its lower level drives towards physical well-being. Again, despite the sense in the poem that excessive sorrow is unnatural, the Knight is permitted to suffer by Nature, wonder though that may be (467-9). Can such grief, then, really be regarded as unnatural? Whether or not we see Nature's area of control as confined to the physical, only a very limited view of what is natural (derived from an awareness that organisms seek to combat the debilitations they suffer unqualified by a recognition that such debilitations themselves belong to a natural scheme) can produce the claim that extreme grief is unnatural in man. A wider understanding of what is natural for man might, indeed, lead us to suppose that the reference to the law of kinde in the introduction to the story of Seys 14 Many critics think that the Knight is in some degree healed or consoled. See, e.g., J. Norton-Smith, Geoffrey Chaucer (London, 1974), 13ff., and P. M. Kean, Chaucer and the Making of English Poetry, shortened edition (London, 1982), 30. J6rg O. Fichte, Chaucer's 'A-rt Poetical': A Study in Chaucerian Poetics (Tiibingen, 1980), 43, robustly, and I think rightly, affirms that this is not the case. 15 Fyler, Chaucer and Ovid, 74, considers that Chaucer contrasts the blithe unconsciousness of spring with mankind's inability to forget that winter will return. For Fyler, apparently, man and the natural world are involved in the same way in the passage of time. Whilst, like Fyler, I see man's consciousness as a possession which distinguishes him from the natural world, I also see man's mortality as part of the difference between him and the regenerable earth. 16 See nn. 6 and 9 above. Many critics see Nature in the poem as a sympathetic healer concerned to cure the Knight. 164 WHITE</page><page sequence="9">CHAUCER COMPROMISING NATURE and Alcyone does not condemn Alcyone but rather points to the naturalness of her death from grief. Problems, then, arise around the idea of regulating man's behaviour 'according to nature', and questions may be asked about the beneficence of the natural dispensation for man. Why does Nature permit the kind of suffering the Knight endures and why, beyond that, do human beings die, when part, at least, of the animal world is subject only to a cycle of change? Similarly subversive questions seem to me to arise in The Parlement of Foules where, once again, Nature's claims to be at the centre of a satisfying moral system and to preside over a beneficent world order are treated with more than a touch of scepticism. In the Parlement, I take it that Chaucer is, as Lumiansky suggested,17 interested in reconciling the pursuit of love with the demands of a morality which insists on other-worldly perspectives ('Know thyself first immortal' (73)) and unselfish commitment to the common good (46ff., 73 ff.). I understand the Cupid and Venus scene to be essentially confirmatory of Africanus' perspective.18 The scene admits sexual love to have many undesirable elements, so that a defence of it against the implied criticisms of the Africanan perspective does not appear viable. Lovers do seem, fundamentally, to be 'likerous folke' (79). The Nature scene, I think, proposes a way of reconciling sexual love with the demands of Africanan morality. The harmony between individuals which sexual love promotes can be understood as an aspect of cosmic order expressive of the divine will. So the fulfilling of individual sexual drives may be felt to serve a wider purpose also, and thus perhaps may be regarded as serving 'commune profit'. Further, though Nature's procreative concern is not emphasized in the Parlement, such a concern is a prominent characteristic of Nature in Alan of Lille's De Planctu Naturae, to which Chaucer specifically directs us, and in the Nature tradition at large, and we may be meant to suppose that 'commune profit' is ministered to in the preservation of the species which procreation achieves. Thus love under Nature would accommodate the world and the 'nede' (384) of individuals but still respect and fulfil the kind of moral demands Africanus makes.19 17 R. M. Lumiansky, 'Chaucer's Parlement of Foules: A Philosophical Interpretation', RES 24 (1948), 81-9. 18 Despite David Aers, 'The Parliament of Foules: Authority, the Knower and the Known', Chaucer Review, 16 (1981), 1-17 (p.8). 19 Among critics who see something of this sort as the 'message' of the Parlement are J. A. W. Bennett, The Parlement of Foules (Oxford, 1957) and G. D. Economou, The Goddess Natura in Medieval Literature (Cambridge, Mass., 1972). 165</page><page sequence="10">Chaucer takes care to associate Nature with the divine and with an ordered harmony of creation: Nature, the vicaire of the almyghty Lord, That hot, cold, hevy, lyght, moyst, and dreye Hath knyt by evene noumbres of acord, . . . (379-81)20 This harmonious binding of the elements is recalled in the description of Nature's pairing off of the birds towards the end of the poem: To every foul Nature yaf his make By evene acord, . . . (667-8) In this way sexual love is associated with elemental harmony. Nature's ordering and harmonizing power is further evident in her bringing together birds of very different types among whom peaceful relations are by no means universal into (relatively) ordered assembly and in her directing the course of their parliament by her 'ryghtful ordenaunce' (390), restoring order when chaos threatens (519ff., 617ff.). This magisterial and beneficent harmonizing force presents a strong contrast to the dissolute Venus in whose Temple we find the disharmony of frustration in love. We may even feel we have discovered a resolution of the paradox presented by the inscriptions on the entrance to the garden (127-40)-under Venus man is doomed to find trouble in love, under Nature he can find joy.21 Chaucer claims his Nature is right as Aleyn, in the Pleynt of Kynde, Devyseth [her] of aray and face, . . . (316-17) But one very significant difference is in the relation of the two figures to Reason. In the De Planctu Naturae there is no distance between Nature and Reason: to follow Nature is to follow Reason.22 But in the Parlement Nature, addressing the formel, makes this very revealing remark: 20 Cf. De Planctu Naturae, vii. ff. 21 We may find ourselves reminded of the relationship between Nature and Venus in the De Planctu Naturae (see, e.g., x. 131 ff.). 22 At De Planctu Naturae, ii. 232-4 man is pictured on Nature's tunica freeing himself from sensuality in order to follow reason. See also vi. 66-8. 166 WHITE</page><page sequence="11">CHAUCER COMPROMISING NATURE But as for counseyl for to chese a make, If I were Resoun, thanne wolde I Conseyle yow the royal tercel take, As seyde the tercelet ful skylfully, As for the gentilleste and most worthi, Which I have wrought so wel to my plesaunce That to yow hit oughte been a suffisaunce. (631-7) Why is Nature here made to separate herself so deliberately from Reason and the line Reason would take?23 Nature's remark comes just after she has insisted that the formel should be free to make up her own mind about which of her suitors shall marry her and just before she grants the formel her 'firste bone' (643), which turns out to be not to mate at all 'as yit' (652-3). Nature's unwillingness to ally herself straightforwardly with Reason may perhaps be accounted for by her awareness of the obligations she is under towards the irrational desires of individuals. It is the function of the reason to argue the will, if necessary, into the right course of action, but Nature, at any rate in the sphere of love, respects the will's unreasonableness.24 Earlier in the poem Nature showed her respect for the wishes of the females of all the species of birds: But natheles, in this condicioun Mot be the choys of everich that is heere, That she agre to his eleccioun, Whoso he be that shulde be hire feere. This is oure usage alwey, fro yer to yeere, . . . (407-11) In the case of the noble birds this respect for the will of the individual apparently leads to the frustration of Nature's intentions. Nature's insistence on the formel's liberty to choose puts her own plan for the mating of the birds at risk (and thus threatens her harmonizing (and procreative) purposes), and it also poses a double threat to what Reason would recommend: the formel might make an unreasonable choice of partner or, as proves to be the case, might refuse to make a choice at all. It may be that next year all will go according to plan, though we have no right, I think, to take this for 23 Certain manuscripts read 'If it were Resoun' in line 632, but 'If I were Resoun' is very much the editorial preference. The reading with 'it' would give us a Nature lacking confidence in her right or ability to give moral advice. 24 R. W. Frank, 'Structure and Meaning in the Parlement ofFoules', PMLA 71 (1956), 530-9, remarks, 'She is Nature not Reason. Reason has very little to do with love. Love is irrational' (p. 538). Perhaps this remark covers the unreasonableness of the formel's not loving. 167</page><page sequence="12">granted.25 But whatever happens to these particular birds, we have been shown that the desires of an individual can produce action which opposes Nature and Reason, and yet that such 'unnatural' irrationality has to be sanctioned by a Nature insistent on the freedom of the individual.26 The irrationality of human behaviour is not, it seems, unnatural, being an integral part of the domain of Nature, and so, as with The Book of the Duchess, the category of the natural turns out not to provide man with secure moral guidelines. The Parlement invites us to contrast Nature and Venus, finding ourselves repelled by the sterility, debauchery, and pain over which Venus presides and delighted by the joyful fertility and harmony, ultimately in the service of the divine, which Nature's rule brings forth. But the behaviour of the noble birds calls this neat distinction into question.27 They are clearly part of the domain of Nature, but the formel, with a regard to her own wishes rather than that 'commune profit' for which Nature, it is suggested, is concerned, fails to fulfil the purposes Nature has established for her, and thus, it may be felt, sets herself against fertility and harmony.28 The male birds seem doomed to the 'sykes hoote' (246) 'engendered with desyr' (248) which fill the Temple of Venus: for at least two of them this state will, in all probability, exceed the year's term, and 'the bittere goddesse Jelosye' (252) will be at work among them. The formel's action and its consequences indicate how frustration in love is a natural state of affairs (perhaps particularly if one's love is of a more refined and noble variety). Yet evidently such frustration is at the centre of the experience of love under Venus, as is emblematized, it seems, by the statue of Priapus In swich aray as whan the asse hym shente With cri by nighte, . . .

Leicester, 'The Harmony of Chaucer's Parlement: A Dissonant Voice', Chaucer Review, 9 (1974), 15-34, likewise suggests that the formel might continue her resistance to Nature's plan (p. 32). 26 Leicester, ibid., thinks that the focus of the poem is on the disruptive force of individual personality, which Nature seeks to channel into institutional forms. It seems difficult, however, to exonerate Nature completely from blame for the disruption caused by the formel. 27 Fyler, Chaucer and Ovid, 89, finds that 'the more one looks at the antithesis of Venus and Nature, the less sharply defined it seems'. He suggests that through the tercels Venus enters Nature's realm. 28 J. D. Burnley, Chaucer's Language and the Philosophers' Tradition (Cambridge, 1979), 129, states that the formel's 'sensitivity . . . joins the sensuality of the Temple of Venus as elements destructive of natural, rational and ultimately divine order'. As I understand it, however, human free will, with its destructive potentialities, is in a strong sense part of the natural realm. 168 WHITE</page><page sequence="13">CHAUCER COMPROMISING NATURE which stands 'in sovereyn place' (254) in the Temple.29 The formel herself blurs the distinction between love under Nature and love under Venus when she deflects Nature's invitation to choose a suitor, saying: I wol nat serve Venus ne Cupide, Forsothe as yit, by no manere weye. (652-3)30 Chaucer has affirmed with some emphasis love's capacity to throw into confusion the person who contemplates it: The lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne, Th'assay so hard, so sharp the conquerynge, The dredful joye alwey that slit so yerne: Al this mene I by Love, that my felynge Astonyeth with his wonderful werkynge So sore, iwis, that whan I on hym thynke Nat wot I wel wher that I flete or synke. (1-7) The poet's invalidation of the distinction he offers us for making sense of love is consonant with this initial stress on the difficulty of the subject.31 Love turns out to be irresolvably ambivalent; both inscrip- tions on the gate are always relevant, not with any certainty to be dissociated from one another.32 In retrospect we can see that the presence of Nature and Venus in the same garden should have alerted us to the impossibility of holding them apart. In the De Planctu Naturae Venus' rebellion distances her from Nature's purposes, but Venus retains the power Nature has delegated to her, and so her 29 See Emerson Brown, 'Hortus Inconclusus: The Significance of Priapus and Pyramus and Thisbe in the Merchant's Tale', Chaucer Review, 4 (1970), 31-40. In a later article, 'Priapus and the Parlement of Foules', Studies in Philology, 72 (1975), 258-74, Brown finds a link between Priapus' frustration and the eagle suitors. 30 B. F. Huppe and D. W. Robertson, Fruyt and Chaf (Princeton, 1963), 141-2, think that the formel realizes that Nature's suggestion as to whom she should choose is a recommendation, unbeknown to Nature, of an unnatural and unreasonable love (i.e. of the kind sponsored by Venus and Cupid): in good conscience the formel cannot do as Nature suggests. But the formel's 'as yit' casts doubt on this interpretation. Economou, The Goddess Natura, 147, regards the formel as deluded in supposing that she will have to serve Venus and Cupid-her love could be natural. Reviewing Economou's book (RES NS 25 (1974), 190-2) P. M. Kean pertinently asks why, if this is the case, Nature does not disabuse the formel. 31 Fyler, Chaucer and Ovid, who points out how the oppositions the poem presents blur as it proceeds, considers that the Parlement shows us how 'as fallen, conscious man faces instinctive Nature, the systems that the mind discovers in the world, or imposes on it, verge on collapse' (p. 82). 32 As several critics, including W. H. Clemen, Chaucer's Early Poetry (London, 1963), 140, and Kean, Chaucer, 53, have affirmed. 169</page><page sequence="14">rebellion defines the way in which (for all Nature's laments) the influence of Nature now works upon men. In the Parlement the love of the Temple of Venus is perhaps to be seen as a force of Nature.33 There are good reasons, in fact, for being wary of unqualified claims that Nature exerts a benign influence over man. Like The Book of the Duchess the Parlement may deal in two ideas of nature, relating severally to the non-human and the human. The formel is apparently the only bird whose will runs counter to Nature's, perhaps because Chaucer is working a contrast between humanity with its natural capacity of free choice and the non-human world (the lower birds).34 The joyful harmony at the end of the poem may be founded upon an absence of free will. The roundel celebrates a natural cycle: Now welcome, somer, with thy sonne softe, That hast thes wintres wedres overshake, And driven away the longe nyghtes blake! (680-2) A feature of this cycle is the 'recovering' by each bird of his make (688). But the 'human' birds stand outside the charmed circle of non-human nature, their experience not delimited by the yearly cycle, the difficulties of that experience unresolved.35 There is no satisfying resolution for the Dreamer either. He is left still, apparently, not having the thing he desires (91) and committed to further reading (695ff.). This suggests that the poem he produces also remains open-ended, failing to provide the satisfaction that it had promised in its proffered resolutions. In these respects it differs from the roundel which settles the issue between wintre and somer unproblematically and returns to its beginning to achieve harmonious closure rather than suggesting misdirected effort and the need painfully to proceed further outside the limits of the poem. Perhaps in the sphere of artistic as of sexual achievement failure and lack of fulfilment are part of the natural human condition. But in any case, symbolically speaking, 33 On the closeness of Venus and Nature see Bennett, Parlement of Foules, 116, and Kean, Chaucer, 49-53. Fyler, Chaucer and Ovid, 89-90, insists that Venus is part of Nature's realm. 34 See, among others, Victoria Rothschild, 'The Parliament of Fowls: Chaucer's Mirror up to Nature?', RES NS 35 (1984), 164-84 (pp. 174-5). 35 Fyler, Chaucer and Ovid, finds the behaviour of the noble birds a symbol of the problems of human consciousness as against the unproblematic instinctiveness of the natural realm (see, e.g., pp. 93-4). B. Bartholomew, Fortuna and Natura: A Reading of Three Chaucer Narratives (The Hague, 1966), 44, speaks of 'the near impossibility of a completely "natural" love for complicated humanity'. 170 WHITE</page><page sequence="15">CHAUCER COMPROMISING NATURE winter and the black nights, despite the rejoicing, have not been dispelled for the (human) poet and for the birds who may figure humanity, and this may remind us of how the Black Knight sits unconsoled amidst the signs of spring. Doubts about the order and harmony even of the non-human world are stimulated by certain facets of the Parlement. The catalogue of birds at 330ff. characterizes them in terms which suggest that their kingdom is riddled with strife and which display unpleasantnesses of other kinds in many species.36 One might well ask what kind of a benign dispensation this is. Perhaps we might go so far as to ask why the universe has been constituted at the elemental level a concors discordia: why this basic component of strife in the relation of things?37 The course of the parliament itself sets clearly before us the tendency of disparate entities not to get along easily together. Though Nature eventually secures some kind of harmonious close, this should not cancel our awareness that uncomfortable antagonisms seem fun- damental to the structure of things. We might begin to suspect that the unsatisfactoriness of the human realm is only an unsurprising reflex of a disharmony endemic to the universe as a whole. A Nature who presides creatively over the terrestrial scene appears again in the Physician's Tale, Virginia being an advertisement for Nature's creative mastery: For Nature hath with sovereyn diligence Yformed hire in so greet excellence, As though she wolde seyn, 'Lo! I, Nature, Thus kan I forme and peynte a creature, Whan that me list; who kan me countrefete? Pigmalion noght, though he ay forge and bete, Or grave, or peynte; for I dar wel seyn Apelles, Zanzis, sholde werche in veyn Outher to grave, or peynte, or forge, or bete, If they presumed me to countrefete.

See also Fyler, Chaucer and Ovid, 90-1, who in addition finds disagreeable attributes in the catalogue of trees at 11. 176-82. When the cuckoo claims to be speaking 'For comune spede' (507), this only ironically displays a tendency in the realm of Nature for Africanus' 'commune profit' to be ignored in favour of self- centred individual drives. 37 See Kean, Chaucer, 45. Gardiner Stillwell, 'Unity and Comedy in Chaucer's Parlement of Foules',JEGP 49 (1950), 470-95, claims that Nature's universe 'is not so well ordered as it might be' (p. 480). 171</page><page sequence="16">Right as me list, and ech thyng in my cure is Under the moone, that may wane and waxe, And for my werk right no thyng wol I axe; My lord and I been ful of oon accord. I made hire to the worshipe of my lord; So do I alle myne othere creatures, What colour that they han or what figures.' (CT vi. 9-28) There is a certain complacency in this imagined self-presentation, as well as a not altogether attractive self-aggrandisement. But the course of the story might incline us to wonder how justified Nature's self-satisfaction is. Despite Nature's 'cure', the sublunary world is plainly not penetrated by the harmony Nature might be supposed to sponsor as she works to further the divine plan. Nature, in fact, seems to be responsible for some of the unsatisfactoriness of the world. She produces the superlative beauty of a Virginia only, apparently, when she feels like it ('Whan that me list'). This remark and the reference to 'alle myne othere creatures' remind us that physical humanity is by no means universally attractive. For all the notion that local ugliness may contribute to the beauty of the whole, it seems to be legitimate to wonder quite how Nature's unattractive productions promote God's 'worshipe'. This consideration may be relevant in the moral sphere also: if Nature is to be understood to produce Virginia's moral excellence, she would then seem also to be responsible for the depravity of 'othere creatures' such as Apius.38 Furthermore, the actual effect of Nature's creating Virginia so beautiful is disastrous. Harry Bailey's comment draws attention to this: Allas, to deere boughte she beautee! Wherfore I seye al day that men may see That yiftes of Fortune and of Nature Been cause of deeth to many a creature. Hire beautee was hire deth, I dar wel sayn. (vi. 293-7) Beauty stimulates evil and sets in train a series of appalling events which invite us to review Nature's complacent self-eulogy with some scepticism. That scepticism will be encouraged if we register the futility in Nature's production of her masterpiece Virginia, who goes to waste in an untimely death, and does so as a virgin who has contributed nothing to the creative performance on which Nature so 38 Virginia's moral character is not explicitly said to be given her by Nature. In medieval writings moral qualities are sometimes regarded as in Nature's gift (see, e.g., BD 1195-8; CT v. 484-7), though she is often understood not to provide this part of man's endowment. 172 WHITE</page><page sequence="17">CHAUCER COMPROMISING NATURE prides herself. And the fragility of Nature's great creation suggests that the conventional topos of the superiority of her creativity to that of human artists requires close examination. Once again, Chaucer presents an apparently benign Nature, powerful and creative, at one with the divine, only to compromise that presentation by implicating Nature in debility, disorder, depravity, and destruction.39 In Troilus and Criseyde, too, Chaucer initially presents Nature positively and then incites us to ask doubting questions about the natural. The notion of kynde is first invoked when Troilus is about to be smitten by love. Troilus' initial dismissive attitude towards love is presented by the narrator as both foolish and morally reprehensible: O blynde world, O blynde entencioun! How often falleth al the effect contraire Of surquidrie and foul presumpcioun; For kaught is proud, and kaught is debonaire. This Troilus is clomben on the staire, And litel weneth that he moot descenden; But alday faileth thing that fooles wenden. (i. 211-17) The ensuing comparison with 'proude Bayard' enforces further the absurdity and immorality of Troilus' presumptuous defiance of the God of love. Bayard attempts to cast off the law of his own nature before he considers: Yet am I but an hors, and horses lawe I moot endure, . . . (i. 223-4) The invocation of the idea of law reinforces the feeling that it would be improper to go against the (natural) course of one's being. All this prepares us to understand the immutable law of kynde by which love has irresistible power over mankind as something which constrains man appropriately-Troilus' scorn, like Bayard's revolt, besides being futile, flies in the face of the proper natural order: 39 As is appropriate for the superintendent of the sublunary realm. Interestingly, and though Economou, The Goddess Natura, 149, supposes otherwise in the case of the Parlement, it seems to me that when Chaucer presents a personified or quasi-personified Nature, he never clearly accords this power jurisdiction over the realm above the moon. 173</page><page sequence="18">Forthy ensample taketh of this man, Ye wise, proude, and worthi folkes alle, To scornen Love, which that so soone kan The fredom-of youre hertes to hym thralle; For evere it was, and evere it shal byfalle, That Love40 is he that alle thing may bynde, For may no man fordon the lawe of kynde. (i. 232-8) The law of nature can be understood as the order of natural instinct or as the natural moral law,41 and Chaucer here may well be using the ambiguity of the concept to enhance the morally normative status of a natural instinctual process. Troilus' submission to the natural and inevitable is further suggested to be good in the following stanzas. The wisest, strongest, worthiest, and greatest have all been overcome by love (i. 241-4): And trewelich it sit wel to be so, For alderwisest han therwith ben plesed; And they that han ben aldermost in wo, With love han ben comforted moost and esed; And ofte it hath the cruel herte apesed, And worthi folk maad worthier of name, And causeth moost to dreden vice and shame.

(i. 246-59) The recognition of the coerciveness of love, which enslaves, removes freedom, and has to be bowed before, and the affirmation of the goodness of love, which 'may nat goodly ben withstonde', is 'so 40 Ida Gordon, The Double Sorrow of Troilus (Oxford, 1970), 63-73, thinks Love here can be understood as having reference to the Christian God, so that the law of kynde becomes (in one possible understanding) caritas. But since Love at i. 206ff. is plainly the familiar secular deity and this dominates our understanding of the i. 232 ff. passage, it seems difficult to take love at i. 237 as also the Christian deity. 41 This duality is to be found in the definitions of natural law in the Corpus luris Civilis. 174 WHITE</page><page sequence="19">CHAUCER COMPROMISING NATURE vertuous in kynde'42 and 'so wel kan yow lede' might be thought to coexist rather uneasily. This unease will, I think, make itself felt strongly in a rereading of this passage in the light of the whole work, but at first we should probably enthuse about Troilus' submission to so good an overlord, and take the law of kynde to be something that orders human life according to a proper pattern. In the raptures of his love Troilus would certainly subscribe to this view. He desires for all men the binding of love, which he associates with the natural order: So wolde God, that auctour is of kynde, That with his bond Love of his vertu liste To cerclen hertes alle and faste bynde, That from his bond no wight the wey out wiste; And hertes colde, hem wolde I that he twiste To make hem love, . . . (iii. 1765-70) Troilus' praises of love are here, of course, inspired by Boethius,43 in whose vision love is the great force for harmony throughout the cosmos, so that the imagery of binding carries a positive sense of secure fixedness within an ordered structure (such resonances are available also in the passages from Book I discussed above). The designation of God as 'auctour . . . of kynde' points to the way in which the natural order and its influences such as love are to be seen as in the service of the divine: for Troilus is offering us a vision of natural sexual love as an aspect of divine love-we recall his previous revealing juxtaposition 'O Love, O Charite!' (iii. 1254). Pandarus, however, does not share this vision: For this I have herd seyd of wyse lered, Was nevere man or womman yet bigete That was unapt to suffren loves hete, Celestial, or elles love of kynde; Forthy som grace I hope in hire to fynde. And for to speke of hire in specyal, Hire beauty to bithynken and hire youthe, It sit hire naught to ben celestial As yet, though that hire liste bothe and kowthe; 42 Kynde here may have reference to the individual nature of love (it is so taken in Nevill Coghill's rendering of Troilus (Harmondsworth, 1971)), but it is also possible that it may refer to general Nature and so suggest a division in respect of virtue between what is kynde and what is not. Pandarus later divides love 'of kynde' from love 'celestial' (see below), and such a division may be hinted at in the phrase 'vertuous in kynde'. Meanings of 'sensibly' for 'goodly' and 'powerful' for 'vertuous' are available, but strong moral senses are pressed on us by what is said in the previous stanza. In the light of the completed narrative, however, we might care to revise our understanding of 'vertuous'. 43 See Consolatio, ii, metrum 8. 175</page><page sequence="20">But trewely, it sate hire wel right'nowthe A worthi knyght to loven and cherice, And but she do, I holde it for a vice. (i. 976-87) Unlike Troilus, Pandarus specifically opposes to natural sexual love the service of heaven in celestial love, and thus raises disturbing questions about the relation of nature to the divine and therefore to the good. And for all Pandarus' suggestion that it might be proper for Criseyde to give herself to 'love of kynde', this is not the perspective of the poem's final exhortation to the 'yonge, fresshe folkes, he or she' (v. 1835). Pandarus seems to think in terms of women having a choice as to whether they will serve the law of kynde, whereas in Book I the power of love was presented as something overwhelming against which resistance is futile. It is Troilus' experience which calls forth Book I's comments, and it may be that Chaucer supposes love to affect men and women differently (the Parlement's formel also seemed to have a choice in the matter). Nevertheless, Pandarus apparently envisages Kynde as a force which exerts pressure towards love on Criseyde: Peraunter thynkestow: though it be so, That Kynde wolde don hire to bygynne To have a manere routhe upon my woo, Seyth Daunger, 'Nay, thow shalt me nevere wynne!' (ii. 1373-6) The priorities of this Kynde appear to be sexual: we sense a power akin to the Nature of the Roman de la Rose who is so bent on ensuring that procreation shall take place that she encourages activity of a dubious moral character.44 Certainly, when Pandarus asks the dis- consolate Troilus, 'Hath Kynde the wrought al only hire to plese?' (iv. 1096), the Kynde invoked seems unconcerned about Troilus' faithful service to Criseyde: what matters is that he involve himself in some way in 'plesing' women. The natural sexual drive begins to look disturbingly anarchic (though Pandarus is using the normative conno- tations of Kynde as a means to the moral blackmail of Troilus). Pandarus' Kynde appears to be something that seeks expression regardless of what the person in whom it operates may consciously desire, and which, indeed, can be seen as using human beings as means to its ends, which may not be well attuned to the moral demands of a full humanity. 44 In the Roman Raison recommends that the lover should abandon his pursuit of the Rose (4321 ff.), whilst Nature encourages its taking. 176 WHITE</page><page sequence="21">CHAUCER COMPROMISING NATURE These Pandaran perspectives on Kynde give us a way of focusing the revaluation of the narrator's early remarks on love and kynde which the course of the story stimulates. We have been offered the view that love is part of a proper natural order and that it tends to promote virtue, but with Pandarus' distinction between love 'celestial' and love 'of kynde' in mind, we can see the claim that love is 'vertuous in kynde' as a limiting one: though Troilus is said to grow in virtue (i. 1079ff., iii. 1800ff.), that growth is in the last analysis compromised by his attachment to things of this world. He and his virtues as a lover, despite what he claims in Book III, appear in the poem's final perspective to lack a proper relation to the things of heaven: so much is shown as he despises from on high 'this wrecched world' (v. 1817) and mankind's commitment to 'the blynde lust' (v. 1824), and in the narrator's concluding comments. As for the law of kynde, with Pandarus' comments on the operation of Kynde as sexual impulse and as sponsor of sexual relations in view, that can be understood not so much as the way things naturally and properly are, but as the force of instinct within man. The way in which man partakes love with 'alle thing' (i. 237) may be through the impulses he shares with the animals. But however perfectly the beasts may express their true natures in accordance with the divine plan through following their instincts, kynde as instinct is only one component of man, and its pressure seems very liable to force man off his proper course heavenwards.45 In any case, by the end of Troilus the law of kynde has been made to appear something his subjection to which we should not expect a wise man to celebrate enthusiastically (perhaps here the story educates the narrator, who moves from celebration to condemnation of sexual love). Troilus' fate suggests that sexual love does not urge man benignly along the path his nature should follow, but leads to a painful entrapment within the ultimately unsatisfying. Considered in the light of the narrative as a whole, the imagery of binding, which I earlier suggested had its worrying aspect, confesses clearly its attach- ment to the idea of coercion. We have, I think, to reject the connotations of harmony and proper order in the imagery of binding, just as we have to reject Troilus' Boethian vision of sexual love as serving the divine. Love 'of kynde' cannot, regrettably perhaps, be seen as a manifestation of love 'celestial': it is a phenomenon of the sublunary world and infected with the untrustworthiness of that world. The final perspective offered us is that satisfaction can only be found in a denial of 'feynede loves' (v. 1848), in a movement away 45 Here we perhaps glimpse again the distinction between what is natural for man in his full humanity and what is natural for the non-human creation, which I have argued is important in The Book of the Duchess and The Parlement of Foules. 177</page><page sequence="22">from this world of kynde and its kyndely virtues. But how easy is it to follow the narrator's advice to leave behind the 'worldly vanyte' (v. 1837) of love? The poem's early affirmation of the power of the law of kynde is not compellingly contradicted, and we are left with a worry that most men will not be able to liberate themselves from its power, for all the narrator's passionate recommendation of love 'celestial'.46 On several occasions, then, a Nature whose moral authority and beneficence has apparently been established is demonstrated in the progress of a poem not to be satisfactory in these respects. In the end, man is let down by Nature, even victimized by her. The promise of harmoniously ordered living gives way to a recognition that man's natural lot is to exist, painfully and problematically, outside the schemes of order the poems present. Chaucer, as I mentioned earlier, can treat the natural straightforwardly as a moral norm. The work in which he does this most extensively is the Parson's Tale,47 as we might expect, since here Chaucer abandons the probing complexity of many of his fictions for a discourse altogether more confident of its moral and metaphysical underpinnings. But such confidence hardly typifies the Chaucerian vision, to which a sense of the difficulty of reaching epistemological clarity and moral certainty is central. The compromising of Nature Chaucer invites us to witness testifies powerfully to this sense. 46 Compare the coerciveness of Nature in Confessio Amantis, where it seems that only a holy few can hope to escape her power (viii. 2330-6). As a rider to this discussion of the moral status of the natural in the sexual sphere, mention may be made of a remark of Arcite's at CT i. 1165 ff., where he speaks of how 'positif lawe and swich decree' is perpetually being broken under the influence of love. The phrasing here associates love and its anarchy with the law of nature, against which positive law is often set in medieval legal writing. 47 See CT, x. 491, 577, 754-6, 865-6, 921. 178 WHITE</page></plain_text>
