<plain_text><page sequence="1">NATURAL ORDERS Mink CAROL CLOOS MOON IN ITS FIRST quarter. A week into calendar spring, yet the ground covered with new light snow. A cold, dark March night in upstate New York. The intruders had calculated the darkness, as well as the location of the guard dogs, distracted at another part of the property. Imagining this guerilla warfare drew me in. Growing up during World War II, a friend and I spied from behind trees, like our uncles in the military. We concocted secret-formula poison from garage and kitchen ingredi ents, and buried the bottles in huts camouflaged from the enemy. But the maneuver I had read about in the morning paper was more *\ complex and carried true risk along with exhilara- ^gs"* I drive through that ^^m&amp;J Ontario County terrain ^?r regularly: rich fields, in 9i summer filled with corn, in fall with cabbage and squashes; low wooded hills; a few small streams and marshes. The intruders must have studied the hills and woods for access and cover, and learned the movements of the owners and workers and dogs who live on site. Must have known that the 3,000 mink they released from wire cages were nearing the end of a carefully calculated pregnancy and worth $80 apiece. Although both they and the mink left footprints in the snow, the intruders have never been caught, never been identified as individu als, although their organization had taken responsibility in a fax to the sheriff and the media. Half of the wandering mink were captured over the next few days and rejoined the 2,000 who had not been cut to free dorn. The others were presumed dead. THE MINK do not choose the night, with temperatures never above 19 and wind gusts peaking at 47 miles an hour. No matter?time for exploration is brief and deep instinct tells them to fan out quick ly. They skid over icy patches, weave around cabbage stumps and corn stalks in unplowed fields. The woods is a world of new sensation. The clear, cold air sharp, sharp. They nibble at acorns, and sniff the ground pine and the early purplish ? fronds of skunk melted edges of atica has pushed up small white blossoms, crisp somewhere above, of the force that sways the branches of black oak and hemlock, and reaches down to ruffle their fur. A field mouse scurries by and not one mink pounces, instead pivoting this way and that in confusion, their feet scratching up quartzy snow pebbles from the layers of leaves. When day and sun materialize, the leaves thaw and throw up a differ ent damp funk, not pissy like the cages. And though the mud near the creek has the familiar texture of excrement, it, too, is different, with small stones and twigs bound in. The mink are hungry, overstimulat ed, and cannot stop for the softness of moss. They are even too dis tracted to scrap with one another when they cross paths. In their sheltered ignorance, do they know to fear the calls of the owls and hawks who anticipate death? With their innate skills for climbing and swimming so unprac ticed, do the mink tire from the hills, stop at running water? What are they able to know? And how? Body my house my horse my hound what will I do when you are fallen... ?M.S. Imagining death, the poet May Swenson confronts the old question of duality, with our animal nature a metaphor for the physicality of being. Many animal rights advocates use a similar, if less lyrical, strategy, hoping to link our relationship to animals with our moral life. Their arguments bypass sentiment and the kind of anthropomorphic ani mal's perspective we're familiar with from children's books where bears wear aprons and rabbits ride bicycles. Instead, they use scientific data to corroborate how animals' sensate intelligence and capacity for suffering could correspond to human experience. Our treatment of animals, then, provides a moral threshold. Anima, after all, suggests soul. In light of that, mink farmers' use of the terms "domesticated ani mals" and "animal husbandry" seems sardonic. Wire cages and breeding mounts hardly imply a family.

Books and brochures on fur farm ing are instructive, but not for the squeamish, with their information on pneumatic pelt openers, fleshing and stretching machines (migrant workers usually do the skinning), and "shaping" sleeves for quick drying?Upton Sinclair material. During the Seventies, when the raided farm raised 12,000 mink, its operation was, according to a news paper report, the largest in the East and used armed convoys to trans port finished pelts. Articles attack the problem of fur farm waste: manure and carcasses present a whole different view on compost ing. Calling a mink farm a "ranch" doesn't stifle the smells that can make the operation an undesirable neighbor. THE FUR INDUSTRY, ignoring such facts, spins out a romance that also draws on our animal nature. In their vision, fur's texture and color enhance our relatively hairless human body. Most mink pelts raised in New York are either "stan dard" color?brown?or mahogany, but Wisconsin, a more productive state, also breeds for the fashion col ors of sapphire, white, gun metal, pink, and a rare shade called "laven der hope." About a year ago a woman came into the Grill Room at the Four Seasons restaurant in New York and flung a dead raccoon onto the lun cheon plate of Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue. The activist, who must have been dressed well enough to get by the ma?tre d', shouted at Wintour for wearing fur hats, and scurried off. She has not been identified, other than as a member of an animal rights group. Police classify such intruders as "domestic terrorists." Restaurant staff removed the rac coon and brought Wintour her cof fee. That season, furs were having a comeback, after a disastrous ten years marred by political controver sy and marketing practices that low ered prices and removed the cachet of luxury. Not a part of this fashion revival, the declasse raccoon would have been, however, plentiful as roadkill. IN MY THIRTIES, I wore a series of black seal fur coats from vintage clothing and thrift shops. I repaired the damages inflicted by time, hand-sewing split seams using spe cial leather needles and button twist; gluing down fur that had lift ed from the skin, and camouflaging small bald spots with a marking pen. Hand tailored in the 1920s and '30s, the coats had elegant silk lin ings and unique corded buttons and closures. Every aspect of them was sensuous. The skins had the feel of softened butter, and were light and warm. I wore them everywhere in winter. Then anti-fur activism gained force, with the campaign against seal clubbing prominent. I tried to deflect responsibility to my coat's original buyer: it wasn't my desire and vanity that caused the seals to die?fifty years before. I even once repeated a comedian's line that "these seals had been suicidal," a tasteless comment that only guilt could have tempted out of me. Not long after, I cut out the coat's lin ings and threw the fur away. Last summer, at the Monterey Aquarium on the California coast, I watched the winsome sea otters appearing to smile and wave, as if in an illustration from a storybook. The species had been nearly annhiliated by the craze for otter pelts at the turn of the century. Otters have that kind of short, vel vety fur that I "preferred." They need many more hairs to the inch to keep them warm in the cold Pacific. That same texture made me "like" seal and beaver, and find longer-haired furs, like lynx and mink, unattractive. I understand how wearing leopard, another short-haired pelt, is supposed to make you feel slinky and wild. I know, too, where this sense of dis criminating sensibility, these aes thetics? if unexamined?can lead. I do not believe animals have a soul. It is something else that can reach me, that keeps me in awe. I cannot understand the intelligence that can make a retriever loyal, that can bring the goldfinches to my feeder at the same time every day. And I cannot understand the genetic system that makes the male finch become more vividly yellow, more deeply black week by week in advance of mating. Where do we humans get our sense of physical vanity? No amount of grooming and fashion could give us anything com parable to the feather patterns of a cerulean warbler, to the fur patterns of a red fox. The Chain of Being is great, but only in certain classifica tions are we at the top.
