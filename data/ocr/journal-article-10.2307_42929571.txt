<plain_text><page sequence="1">ICONOGRAPHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE ADI PARVA by H. D. Sankalia Indian iconographical studies have been hitherto based on the Vedas, the epics - Mahãbhãrata Rãmãyana , Purãnas , Agamas and later works on iconography, each source being drawn upon as it served to explain a certain image. In such studies no attempt was made either to trace the development of iconography theoretically from any one source or to trace its development objectively from the evidence of existing monuments in a particular region. Bhattacharya remedied this defect with regard to Buddhist icono- graphy both in its theoretical as well as in its objective aspect to some extent. Under his guidance a similar attempt is being made to study the Jaina iconography. With regard to Brahmanic iconography the recent studies of Jitendra Nath Banerjea1 are welcome, concentrated as they are on the hitherto neglected material, viz. coins and seals and aim to deal exhaustively with the iconographical development through these. So also are the studies of CooMARASWAMY who has selected certain items from icons and sculp- tures and show their course through early Hindu and Buddhist literature as well as sculpture. In all these studies the Mahãbhãrata is used as a source now and then, but there has been no attempt to explore it thoroughly in the manner contemplated here. Particularly this seems to be desirable now, when we have its critical text. In the present study which covers the Ädi Parva only, besides icono- graphical descriptions of gods and goddesses, their names are also given and discussed, for they are connotative ; as also wherever. necessary the circumstances under which a given name or certain description of a deity is mentioned. Further these iconographical features, names and incidents are compared with those occuring in early inscriptions, coins and sculptures. 1 The Development of Hindu Iconography, Calcutta University, 1941. 149</page><page sequence="2">150 H.

Such a study, it is expected, will throw light not only on the relative age - the iconographical development - of a deity, but also on the subjects like the antiquity of the cult of Gopāla-Krsņa, and the relative age of the particular Mahābhārata passage, contributing another cultural - or higher text criticism. The subject deals with the following aspects : (1) Invocation to a deity at the beginning of an adhyaya or parva . (2) Names of deities, together with the description of their (а) dress, (б) weapons, (c) other emblems, and (J) vāhana. (3) The circumstances under which a certain deity s description occurs. Invocation . - Excepting the invocatory verse at the beginning of the Adi Parva, where salutations are first offered to Nara, Nārāyaņa and SarasvatI, in the Adi Parva, whenever there is an invocation at the beginning of an adhyaya or parva, it is usually to Brahmā2 and once to Guru Vyãsa3. No doubt a few, North Indian and Devanāgari Mss. mention Gaņeša even before this stanza, but these are regarded late and interpolated4 and rightly. For archaeologically considering both the architectural, sculptural and epigraphical evidence, not only the cult, but also ordinary reference to Gaņeša is late5. So far as Gujarāt~Kāthiawār are concerned, it may be definitely said that Gaņeša 's images and invocatory references6 in inscriptions become common in or about the 10th century A.D. And as far as the writer's knowledge goes, the same may be said about inscriptions of Northern India where as GETTY has pointed out the earliest dated epigraphical invocation to Gaņeša (Vinäyaka) is in the Ghatiyãla (Jodhpur) inscription of A.D. 862 u Perhaps in the South, Gaņeša became popular a century or two earlier 2 1.58.3. 3 1.55.2. 4 1. pp. 3-4. 5 Gaņapati is not even mentioned by Varāhamihira in the list of sects flourishing in or before the 5th-6th century A.D., still BaneRJEA, op. cit., 250, says, inspite of any numismatic, sculptural and epigraphic evidence, " that it is presumable that the worship of Gaņapati-Vināyaka was in vogue " 6 C/.

A.D. 900) onwards7. In sculpture, faint traces of the early form of Gaņeša have been traced by Coomaraswamy in Amaravati Sculptures70, and recently by Paranavitane in a frieze of a newly excavated stupa in Ceylon, called Kantaka Cetinga, of about the lst-2nd century A.D. 7b, but a full-fledged figure occurs only in the 5th century Gupta temple at Bhumara. This, the definite occurrence of a Ganes a image in a Gupta monument, may well explain the intrusion of Gaņapati - Vyäsa episode in the North Indian Mahabharata Mss. It is also in the north, as Getty has observed, that a personal name - Gaņapati-nāga - appears about the same time in the Allahabad Pillar inscription of Samudra Gupta. If well-authenticated and dated literary evidence is examined, perhaps a similar conclusion will be drawn regarding the position of Gaņeša in literature70. The same is not however the case with Šiva or Visņu. Inscriptions from about the 5th century A.D., invoke either Brahmā, Visņu or Šiva. It is about this period that the images and the cult of these gods are very strongly evident. Looking however to the tenor of the entire Adi Parva, the one invocation to Šiva as Pinākin8, relegated to the footnote by the Editor, seems justified. Names and Description of Deities. Brahma : Among his epithets the following are most common : Prajāpati, Pitāmaha or Sarvapitāmaha, Paramesthi, Sthāņu, Suraguru9, Svayambhu. No iconographical description occurs. ^ Šiva : It is not a little surprising that among his epithets in the Adi ^ Parva the epithet Šiva occurs but once and that too not without a variant reading10, the others are : (1) Bheganetrahara, (2) Devesa, (3) Devadeva, (4) Hara, (5) Išāna, (6) Is vara, (7) Kirātarūpa, (8) Mahe deva, (9) Nīlakaņtha,2(?)

SANKALIA Some of these are common with those of the Rudras : Mrgavyàdha, Šarva, Nirrti, Aja-Ekapāda, Ahirbudhnya, PinākI, Dahana, Išvara, Kapālī, Sthāņu, Bhava.13 All these may be regarded as names of Šiva. Whereas all these names are significant, epithets No. (1) Bhaganetrahara, (7) Kirātarupa or (Vāpu), (9) Nīlakaņtha, (10) PinākI, (13) Sthāņu, (15) Tripurāri, (16) Tryambaka, and (17) Umāpati imply the respective episodes which gave this name to Siva, though in the Adi Parva only the episodes implied in Nos. 7 and 15 are slightly referred to. No clear idea of Šiva's anthromorphic form is given anywhere. But the story of Tilottamā tells us how one of the forms of Šiva - Sthāņu, or Mahādeva - came to be four-faced. It was while trying to behold this fair apsarā from all quarters that the four faces were created.14 Forms like Kirāta, Samkara, Umāpati, PinākI imply a human form, but no idea can be had of the number of arms . Most probably the number of arms were only two. And the weapons associated with Šiva are Šūla (Šūlapāņi),15 trisūla J6 (the bow), Pimķa, (Pināki,17 Pinākadhrk,18) krfi (mahâdevakftyam),19 and the astras ,20 among which the Pāšupata seems to be the chief, called Mahāstra.21 Early epigraphical evidence tends to give much the same conclusion. And perhaps a number of other epithets of Šiva, implying such episodes as the Tändava-nrtya will be found to be late. Paul's studies in inscriptions of the Gupta period (c. A.D. 320-500) reveal that Siva as Bhairava was known, so also his epithets Hara, īsa, Mahādeva, Maheávara, Pašupati, Šambhu, Šiva (mentioned with his linga),22 whereas the writer's studies of early inscriptions of the Deccan (c. 100 B.c. - A.D. 300) show that in this period the only epithets of Šiva current were with the prefixes Šiva and Šula and Skanda. Even the epithet Šambhu is absent. These iconographical features of Šiva differ in one important respect from those of Vedic Rudra. In the RgVeda Rudra carries a thunderbolt, 13 1.60.1-3. 14 1.203.22-6. 15 1.44.22. 1 6 According to V. L. 1 .2 1 8.3 1 . 17 1.28.20. 18 1.44.22. 19 1.2.15. 20 1.225.10. v. 1.

This weapon however is almost always associated with Šiva in early Indian coins. Besides the probable lihgam- like symbol on an early indigenous coin, the trisüla is found on the coins of the Pāncāla king Rudragupta, other early coins, and on the coin of Werna Kadphises.25 Similarly the earliest representations of Šivas anthropomorphic form on the coins from Ujjain and its vicinity,26 on the coins of foreign rulers Gondophares,27 Maues, and the Kushan kings Werna Kadphises28 and Vāsudeva29 are usually two-armed and one-faced. But on certain Ujjain coins,30 as well as the coins of the Kushan kings Kañishka and Huvishka poly-armed and -headed Siva begins to appear. When so armed the figure carries a number of other objects such as vajra , pāsa , ^amanc/a/u, ca£ra, emblems which were reserved for other gods in an earlier period. "From the comparison of Siva's iconographical features with the Vedic and the early numismatic it would seem that his Mahābhāratic features would place him somewhere between the two periods. The rarity of the epithet Siva in the Adi Parva cannot be explained at present. For though not applied specifically to Rudra in the RgVeda, being applicable to other gods in the sense of 4 auspicious ', in the later period, early numismatic and epigraphical, as mentioned above, it was of common occurrence as an epithet and as the first part of a personal name. In the Vãyu P urāna, according to the details kindly supplied by Patil, among the epithets of Brahmā the following are found : Caturmukha, Sahasramïïrdhâ Kamalagarbhàbhah , Puņdarīkāksa, Hirnyagarbha, Adideva, Prajāpati, Išvara, Mahādeva, Bhūta, Vibhu, Yajña, Ka vi, Kapila, Agni, Svayambhu. He is also called Nârayana, but this epithet has nothing to do with Visriu. Purusa, Svayambhü, Hirnyagarbha and Parame sthī are common epithets, but Pitāmahais not. 24 Macdonell, Vedic Mythology , 74. 2d Banerjee, op. cit. 127-9. 26 Ibid., 130. 27 Ibid., 132. 28 Ibid., 135. 29 Ibid., 140. 30 Ibid., 130.</page><page sequence="6">154 H.

The epithet Trilocana occurs but it is not very common and the story does not occur. His other epithets are : GuhāvāsI, Mahâyogi, Khecara, Rajanīcara and Goghna. The epithets of both Brahmā and Šiva are more varied than those found in the Adi Parva. If they are found in all the mss. of the Vāyu, then it will be possible to infer a later and fuller development of the iconographical features of Šiva and also a later composition of the Vãyu. VlSŅU : Visņu has the following epithets : (1) Amitraghna,31 (2) Ananta,33 (3) Cakrâyudha,34 (4) Dãmodara,35 (5) Govinda,36 (6) Hari,37 (7) Hrsīkesa/8 (8) Janārdana,39 (9) Kesava,40 (10) Krsņa,41 (11) Madhusūdana,42 (12) Mohinī,43 (13) Mādhava,44 (14) Nãrãyana,45 (15) Purusottama,46 (16) Vāsudeva,47 (17) Vaikuņtha,48 and (18) Yogešvara.49 Of these of frequent occurrence besides Viçnu are the epithets Nãrãyana, Vāsudeva, and Krsņa ; less frequent Kesava and Janārdana, whereas Dãmodara, Govinda, Mohinī, Vaikuņtha, Yogešvara are mentioned only once. Visņu thus appears to be identified with Nãrãyana, and Krsņa, son of Vasudeva and Devakī. However, there are certain epithets, which always come in a group or a particular context. Thus Nara and Nãrãyana, Kesava and Rāma (Balabhadra), Nãrãyana and LaksmI, Krsņa, with Vāsudeva, Dāšārha, Purusottama, Kesava. 31 Ibid., 135-7. 32 1.58.49-51. 33 1.16.14. 34 1.16.6. 35 1.180.17. 36 1.191.19; 212.30. 37 1.1.22. 38 Ibid. 39 1.197.20; 212.21. 40 1.2.222; 189.31 ; 199.50. 41 1.50.15; 216.25; 189.31 ; 2.147; 1.124; 2.93; 1.66. 42 1.191.18; 210.3. 43 1.16.39. 44 1.210.4; 213.20. 45 1. p. 3; 15.11 ; 16.14 and 35; 219.15; 1.117; 17.10-20. 46 1.90.91 ; 58.49-51 ; 199.7. 47 1 .1.193 ; 219.15 ; 199.6; 1.118-9. 48 1.58.49-51. 49 1.2.147.</page><page sequence="7">ICONOGRAPHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE ADI PARVA 155 Visņu is identified with Purusa, Brahmā, Rta, Išāna and others,50 while there is a reference - implied - to the Virāt-svarūpa of Krsņa.51 From purely iconographical point of view we find two 44 strata ", each giving similar details, but important for tracing the development of later Visņuite iconography. In the first 44 stratum ", Nārāyaņa is said to be wearing Kaustubha jewel on his breast,52 or bearing the Sudaršana cafara,53 (while Nara had a divya dhanus ). His full-fledged description is once given, when he was approached by all the gods, after being advised by Brahmā to take birth in this world. Here, as in later iconographical texts, he is described as " caĶragadāpāņih pìtavasàsita- prabhah padmanãbhah 54 44 wieldin? a cafara and gada, and dressed in a yellow garment." Näräyana got the Garuda as his vāhana, and as an emblem on his Dhvajā,55 in exchange for the boon of immortality which he gave to Garuda. Identical are Krsņa s weapons and emblems in the 44 Mahābhārata- time ". As Vãsudeva he obtained the cakra , (which had the power to come back as a boomerang), called now Vajranābha, from Agni,56 and the Kaumodakī Gadā from Varuņa.57 What is important to observe is that both Näräyana and Kfsna Vãsudeva are endowed with two weapons only, implying the possession of two arms or hands. And this is so even in the eleventh adhyãya of the Gitā, where Visņu-Krsņa at Arjuna s request assumes once again his normal form. In this mãnusa rapa (human form), Krsņa wore a fairita , and though caturbhuja (four-armed), carried only the gadā and cafara.5* No doubt the sahkha is mentioned along with the gada and cafra as when Krsņa goes to Ha&gt;tināpura,58a or in the Gita , but it appears that these weapons and the sañfaha were never held together at one time as in later iconographical texts. Few coins or seals of the early Christian or pre-Christian era bear the figure of Visņu. But coins have been found with the symbol of 50 1.1.20-1. 51 1,1.124. 52 1.16.35. 53 1.17.19-20. 54 1.58.49-51. 55 1.29.16. 56 1.216.44. 57 1.216.25.

SANKALlA a cafara or wheel ; of such representations an " elaborate " or a double wheel and lotus symbol appearing on the reverse of a unique coin of the Vrsņi Râjanyagana is regarded by Banerjea59 as the representation of the Sudarsana-cakra of Visņu- Kfsna. The cafara, though not associated with Visņu in Vedic mythology then, may be the earliest Visņuite symbol ; Garuda and the gadā coming next, and still later such symbols as padma , sahfaha and others which are found in figures from the 5th century onwards. Among the epithets signifying the various exploits of Visņu, two - Govinda and Dāmodara - are important, regarding the connection of Gokula or Bāla-Krsņa and the Dvārakā or Mahā(bhārata) Krsņa. The reading Dāmodara seems to be uniformly used by all Mss., for no variant reading is mentioned. It is applied to Kfsna when he and Balarāma attend the DraupadI svayamvara , and see the Pāņdavas (as brāhmaņas) take away Draupadi in the face of opposition by Ksatriyas.60 The occurrence of the epithet Govinda also stands unchallenged but the first part of the 2nd line is doubtful,61 whereas in the second case, there is also a reading 4 Mādhava '62 If both these epithets, about which the text is fairly correct and unanimous, really go back to the first or early period (about 300 B.C.) of the composition of the present Mahābhārata , then it may be said with some justification that by this time Visņu was being identified both with the Dvārakā and Gokula Krsņa. While considering the epigraphical references it may be said that the reading 4 Govinda 1 may not be later than the 5th century A.D., for, by this time it was already current,63 whereas, as Dr. Katre pointed out to the writer, it was regarded as a samjnã-vãcafaa (personal name) by the Vārttika on Pāņini. Similar acquaintance with the early life of Krsņa s brother Balarāma is indicated by the latter s epithets 44 Vanamālī " Nīlavāsā ",64 It is in these words that the Bhāgavata , an admittedly later Purāņa than the Mahābhārata describes him, while Balarāma visits Gokula- Vrndā vana again. His other epithets are Rāma,65 and Haladhara66 or Halâyudha.67 59 Banerjee, op. cit. 145. 60 1.180.17. 61 1.191.19. 62 1.212.30. 63 Cf.

Parašurāma is mentioned once as Rāma, called " a wielder of weapons " (Šastrabhrt) and placed between the Tretā and Dvāpara (yugas).68 Twice there is a reference to Rāma Dāšarathi, in which he is described as a great sacrificer along with other former kings ; and a speaker of truth respectively.69 This delineation of Rāma as a former great king is more in keeping with his character hinted at by early inscriptions,70 than with later purāņic accounts which bestow divinity on him. Sûrya has such epithets as Aditya, Arkaja, Bhāskara, Vibhāvasu.71 Neither in the critical edition nor in the expurgated passages is his full anthropomorphic form described. But Adityas are associated with kwdalaJ2 (a round ear-ornament). Karņa is born with a sahaja (natural) ka^aca and £unc/a/as ; 73 whereas in a passage from D4 (a mixed Devanāgari Ms. from Tanjore)74 Sûrya tells Kunti that she will have a son bearing Aditya Kuņdalas (aditya £unc/afe) and his impregnable kavaca. It is therefore reasonable to assume that Sûrya in his anthropomorphic form was represented with kwialas and a kavaca. Early sculptural evidence may be here noted. Among the North Indian representations, perhaps the earliest figure so far known is from Mathura. It wears a £ai&gt;aca75 and long kwdalas. It is interesting to observe that the Mahābhārata Šurya does not wear high boots, which he does even in the earliest sculptural representation. Indra and other Vedic gods also appear in the Adi Parva. But throughout, Indra plays a prominent part, till being worsted first by Garuda and then Kt?ņa and Arjuna at the time of the Khāņdava-dāha. 68 1.2.3. 69 1.1.168; 197.6. 70 Cf.

SANKALIA Among his epithets - (1) Aditya,76 (2) Balaspdana,77 (3) Devadeveša,78 (4) Harivāhana,79 (5) Sahasrāksa,80 (6) Šakra,81 (7) Vajrapāņi,82 (8) Vajradhara,83 the last is common. Each of these has some cultural and iconographical element. The first- Aditya connects Indra with the Sun and Visņu. The second and the third hint at Indra 's pre-Mahā- bhārata role. The fourth refers to the horse - vahana - of Indra,84 namely a bay-horse. Indra became Sahāsrāksa (1000-eyed) while trying to see the apsarã Tilottamā. He was called Vajradhara, because he wielded the Vajra. Though Indra is credited with other weapons - vayavya astras and s astras - which he gave to Arjuna in the classical or historical iconography - Brahmanic, Jaina and Buddhist, he occupies a subservient rôle, ministering either to Šiva or Visņu, or a Jaina Tírthaňkara, or the Buddha. And his two characteristic emblems or marks are his vajra and the horse or the elephant. Perhaps the earliest figure of Indra is a Jaina sculpture from the Kanakali tila (mound) at Mathura, where he appears seated in lalifasana , with two hands, one holding the vajrafèf** and the other peled off. In Buddhism he appears first in the representations of Buddha's life, and then his personality was perhaps merged into that of Vajrapāņi. Figures of Indra on early indigenous coins (bearing the name Indramitra) are not very distinct and hence not useful for iconographical studies. But his theriomorphic and anthropomorphic representations on the coins of Indo-Greek and- Scythians in which a conical object - mountain Švetavata(?) - , his mount, the elephant, his weapons - vajra , and a long sceptre - as well as a human figure seated and some or all, of the above features not only tally partially as BANERjEA84b has observed with the description of Indra 's icon as given in the Brhatsahmitâ but also with that given in the Mahãbhãrata. 76 1.1.21.6. 77 1.203.25-6. 78 1.21.6; 1.218.13. 79 1.22.1. 80 1.21.6 and 1.203.25.6. 81 1.218.28. 82 1.26.28; 50.12; 158.49. 83 1.150.16. 84 His mount was also an elephant. 1.218.28. 846 Smith, the Jaina Stupa , Asin (MS), XX pl.

But here he is shown holding a sword(?) with two hands. 85 So it is not certain whether the figure is of Indra. In the subsequent period even this position he loses, and is rarely prominently represented. Vedic and other gods are mentioned only once - that too when they turn up to assist Indra in his fight against Krsņa and Arjuna who allow Agni to burn the Khāņdava-vana. In this battle Indra wields the Asani, (perhaps the same as the Vajra(?),) Yama hflladaņda, Dhanešvara, sibila, Varuņa, pãsa , Šiva (who is mentioned for the first time under this name) 86 vicakra , 87 Ašvinas, osadhi , Dhātā dhanu , Tvastā, parvata, Jaya, musala , Mrtyu parasvadha , Aryamâ pariglia, Mitra Ksura-paryarita caķra (a wheel sharp around), Pušā, Bhagi, Savitā Kãrmuka , Rudrās, Vasavas, Marutas, Višvadevā and other gods also joined the battle. 88 On comparing the features of these gods with their Vedic features we find slight but important deviations. Aryaman, Bhaga, Mitra and Savitr are not endowed with any weapon in the Vedic period, 89 while in the Mahãbhãrata they carry parigha , ķārmuka, cafra and a hārmuka respectively. Pusan in the Rg Veda wields a golden spear, and an awl or a goad ; 90 here a hārmaka. It is said to be characteristic of Tvastā in that Veda to hold an iron-axe in his hand ; 91 now he seizes a parvata (mountain). Yama does not seem to have been given any weapon in the Rg Veda . However he appears to be identified with death (mrtyu). 92 In this passage of the Mahãbhãrata Yama and Mrtyu have a distinct personality ; the former carries ķāladaņda , and the latter parasvadham- These are evidently later features of these gods, nearer to Purāņic times. Varuņa wielded his old Vedic weapon the pãsa . Who Jaya is is not clear. Probably he might be one of the door-keeper gods of Visņu. 85 BaneRJI, " The Temple of Siva at Bhumara," MASI.

The only thing that we learn about her form is that she was dressed in a white ( paņdura ) garment. There is no reference to the lotus flower which she is often shown to hold or stand on or both or to the bathing elephants. Her iconographie representations in Gaja- Laksmï or simply standing or sitting and holding a lotus are common on early Indian tribal and other indigenous coins from about the second century b.c.,96 and also on sculptures from Sãnchi and elsewhere. If, therefore, the entire Mahãbhãrata gives a similar evidence, it might be regarded as pointing to the pre-iconographic stage of development of Lak?mî or Šri.97 There are two references to Sarasvatl. The first is an invocation to her, in the opening verse of the parva.98 But here besides calling her a devi no details are given. The second reference runs thus " Kfsņā ( Draupadi ) babhuva paramaprítã nãgai riva sarasvati "" A variant reading gives Nãgair bhogavaft yatha.m Accepting the reading adopted in the text as correct, what can we make out of it ? If the Nāgas refer to elephants, then the idea implied in the sentence might be the bathing of Sarasvatl by the uplifted trunk of an elephant on either side of the goddess. But usually it is the goddess SrI-LaksmI who is so pictured in literature and in early coins and sculptures. So far no early figure of Sarasvatl is found in this form. But the later North Indian Viçnu images 93 Ibid.. 26. 94 Ibid., 51. 95 1.16.37. 96See Banerjea op. cit.t 122-4, and CoomaRASWamy, " The Early Indian Iconography Eastern Art, 1.175 cited by Banerjea. 97 1. p. 3. 98 1.206.3. 99 Nļ Vj (a Newãri ras.) 100</page><page sequence="13">ICONOGRAPHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE ADI PARVA 161 do associate SarasvatI with Visņu as one of his consorts,101 the other being Šrī. Unless however a definite early Gaja-SarasvatI form is found, the explanation here given may be regarded as doubtful. Under the circumstances the variant reading is worth a consideration. The goddess Gang! is described in anthropomorphic form in the Šantanu-Gargā episode.102 But this description is vague, and of no value in tracing her later iconographical features, where she is shown to stand on a maķara , and Yamunâ on a tortoise. The conclusions arrived at by the consideration of the names of Visņu, Šiva and other gods and goddesses together with a brief description of their iconographical features and their correlation with early epig aphic, numismatic and sculptural data must be regarded tentative until the whole of the Mahãbhãrata is studied on similar lines. But if these data also turn out to be of an identical or similar nature then it may be said that (1) the Mahãbhãrata evidence points to an earlier stage of the evolution of the iconography of Siva, Visņu and Sürya, and the goddesses Sri, SarasvatI, when these were primarily two-armed and ordinarily one-faced. (2) Gaņapati was still in the distance. (3) Visņu had begun to be identified not only with D/arakī-Krsņa but with also " Gokula-" or " GopUa "-Kfsna. Conversely the part or parts of the Mahãbhãrata text are very likely of early or pre-Christian date. When, however, the whole of the Mahãbhãrata will be studied on similar lines, and the data compared with the similarly worked out data from other Purēņas (for the present only slight use is made of Patils studies in the Vãyti Purãna), and from early numismatic, sculptural, and epigraphical sources, then it will be possible not only to explain the development (and the factors which contributed to this development) of Hindu iconography, but the rise and development of various cults, the several names of various deities, and also the relative age of the Mahãbhãrata and the Purãna passages. 101 O.
