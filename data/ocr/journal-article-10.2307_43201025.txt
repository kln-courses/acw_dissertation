Warner1 Introduction (and Refrain) I am the father of Aaron (and Christa). I am not a son of Melchisedek. I was born and raised in the RLDS Church (southern Kirtland District), a fourth-generation RLDS on my mother's, Carlisle, Scottish side of the family, and a fifth-generation RLDS on my father's, Warner, German side. Both were hard-working Calvinists, both laboring coal miners. The RLDS mother church was a great womb from which to be birthed, but as an epistemological sanctuary I could not live my whole life there. I am a sojourner in a foreign land, dispersed from the "chosen people," living among alien people with diverse gods and goddesses. "I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips" (Isaiah 6:5 NRSV). That is, on the whole of it, I am a fairly healthy guy! I don't have a recipe for "sacred fudge," but I have had the pleasure of tasting such fudge many times. There is a wide variety of recipes among the people of the world religions who have learned to share food with each other and with such a diversity of recipes I have never been bored. I've heard that one of the keys to achieving good sacred fudge is in the stirring - the slow, constant, gentle, ever-so-patient stirring - over a low flame. It requires persistence and patience, but it is never boring. It is neither "Christ-centered boredom" - nor even Buddha-centered boredom - for that matter. It is ultimately interesting and fascinating, and no amount of patience, persistence, preparation, anticipation, exploration, or even waiting is ever lost! A lifetime of "thinking, waiting, fasting,"2 and patient stirring is involved in "sacred fudge." I was graced and enlightened by pleasant years spent at Graceland - but I never met Elvis there - not once! I attended Bruce Jenner College, and 1 Edward A.

Why Study History? We study history. We study history to know who we are. We study history because we are historical creatures. We study history because we want to know ourselves coming to know ourselves! We examine the past because it is still happening! The past isn't simply "behind us," it is in, around, and through us. It is the before I am, it is the where I am born and where I grow, it is the how and where I live, it is the where I will die, and it constitutes the legacy I will pass on to those who may wish to remember me. We examine history because it endures within and wells up from our deepest psyches (individual and collective), our cultural institutions, our religious heritages, and our axiological foundations and commitments. To be sure, history persists whether we want it to or not, whether we remember it or not, whether we interpret it properly and document it soundly or not. Ultimately history survives and transcends us, but we do not outlive history. History is forecast in our hopes and dreams; it is projected in both our prophecies and our curses. My major professor, Sidney E. Mead, with whom I studied at both the Universities of Chicago and Iowa, would remind us time and again that history is the story and interpretation of "how we got this present out of that past," and he would often qualify this by adding, "or how we 'think' we got it!" He was always sensitive to and conscionable about the all-important interpretive process.1 Or he would quote Abraham Lincoln (from his first debate with Stephen Douglas) in saying it was the story of the "where we are and whither we are tending." We seek, tell, and write history because we are self-conscious about our identities and our historical natures. "We are storytelling animals," wrote Sam Keen. "To be a person is to have a story to tell."4 Lincoln cautioned us, "Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history." I would hasten to add that I don't know why we should even want to try! It is in our very historical nature and cannot be extricated from us. If there happens to be somewhere beyond "where" - a timeless, spaceless, historyless eternity - then human beings do not belong there. The human animal is a creature thoroughly formed by and fitted for temporal, spatial, historical 3 Sidney E.

Richard Niebuhr said so poetically and prophetically (decades before any of the current postmodernists appeared on the scene), humanity "is not only in time but time [and space are] in [humanity]."5 They relativize, finitize, temporalize, and ultimately humanize him thoroughly as Robert Frost affirmed so appropriately that "Earth's the right place for love: I don't know where it's likely to go better."6 To be sure, the study of history is not as easily done as commonly thought. It is difficult and arduous trying to assess the past, and we never know it - or anything about it - fully or perfectly. As "through a glass darkly," we know history only in part and not in its completeness. And we most assuredly cannot know or predict the future! That's a fairly futile effort - even though lots of people in lots of guises have made, and still make, a lot of money at pretending they can! But, of course, we are reminded that all millenarian predictions through which we have lived - 100 percent of them - have been wrong, including the ones by Jesus, Paul, Joseph Smith Jr., and Ann Lee. But we can still learn and know a good deal about (of and from) the past, and there is no reason to become fatalistic, on the one hand, or overconfident, on the other. Peering carefully, thoughtfully, and critically into our pasts will do more to shape the future than all the astrological and/ or apocalyptic crystal ball gazing in the world. Our future is not in the stars, in heaven, or even in future life on other planets. Our future is in ourselves. Our future is in our pasts, since we are such historical selves, and we are so influenced and shaped from and by those pasts. The best and proper study of the future is in the past. It is not only what we remember from the past, but also how we remember that past that shapes who we are. The thesis sentence, repeated again and again, of the Torah and the Hebrew Bible begins with the call and injunction from Yahweh to "remember": Remember Leviticus 25:38 NRSV "I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt." And in his Thursday evening Last Supper, the historical and Jewish Jesus of Nazareth asked his disciples/apostles to break bread and drink wine in "remembrance of me." Out of our Hebrew and Jewish heritage to the Western world we have learned that the function of "remembering" becomes 5 H. Richard Niebuhr, The Meaning of Revelation (New York: Macmillan, 1941), 13.

The past and what we remember is not only an inheritance and cultural reservoir, it is our identity, it is our calling, and it is, in many cases, our destiny. What Is History? Our pasts do not come to us uninterpreted. History is interpretation - conscious or unconscious, good or bad, supported or unsupported - but interpretation nonetheless. Jacques Barzun defined history as interpretation and reinterpretation, retrospection, "re-creation," modification, and appropriation. It is a serious and critical intellectual pursuit. As such it is unfortunate, judged Barzun, that "reading history is a lost avocation."7 Such loss I find all the more regrettable in a democracy where we supposedly depend on enlightened citizens and a somewhat historically informed electorate. Historian Carl Becker reminded us over forty-five years ago that most of the history and historical interpretations we carry around in our minds are poor and / or wrong. Empirically, they are un-researched, undocumented, and not critically examined. But if we carry them around in our minds and we believe them, said Becker, they shape and influence us nonetheless.8 Expanding from my indebtedness to Mead, Barzun, Becker, Charles Beard, and others, let me suggest that good history consists of interpretations of events in the past that are supported by available and relevant data carefully selected and critically examined by a historical observer committed to fairness, objectivity, balance, and truthfulness. Poor or bad history is also an interpretation of events in the past but not researched carefully, not documented by available and relevant data, or not done with objectivity, fairness, and balance. Poor or bad history is often done from subjective, biased, and prejudged perspectives. The historian doing sound history often cannot write the history of a given event or phenomenon precisely because real, sound, and relevant data are simply not extant to be examined. He or she must be respectfully silent about that event or phenomenon. Historians, being human, will interpret events and data differently, but good historians will not deliberately and willfully distort and deceive.

In response to Paul M. Edwards's Mormon History Association address at Snowbird, Utah (after a masterful and generous introduction by Mario de Pillis), Western gunfighters and prostitutes may or may not lie, as the case may be, but Mormon historians most assuredly do, of necessity.9 Not intentionally but of necessity, in the nature of the enterprise! In their necessary construction of interpretations, historians have to simplify the facts in order to clarify the truth. And yes that is always somewhat subjective deriving from the space- time-culture-bound perspectives of the individual minds doing the interpreting. As Carl Becker concurred, at its inception the interpretation or "historical fact is in someone's mind or it is nowhere.""' In the same vein, Alfred North Whitehead reminded us that all generalizations are lies particularly when brought down to the level of, and tested by all the tidbits of, tangible data. But such generalizations, done by gifted and discriminating historians, are not wholly arbitrary or random by any means. These interpretations must come from a fair, careful, and balanced sampling of available and relevant data. We generalize and simplify the facts not intending to distort or deceive, but to feature the thesis of the truth and the mythology of meaning. But we are human in the end. At our best we historians do deceive, even if we don't set out to lie. Our best historians write humanistic works of art, and while works of art and historical sophistication are balanced and lasting, Norman Maclean reminded us in A River Rjtns through It so poetically and autobiographically that life as lived is not a work of art and the great moments, no matter how great, are not balanced and do not last. No matter how clear and well-preserved our histories and our arts, the lives and events we live are shot through with unrelieved complexity and ambiguity. Whatever insightful clarity and simplicity our great histories and works of art achieve are actually deceptions. Human lives are not clear and never simple, and life as lived is not a work of art.11 But we mortal, flawed historians plod ahead anyway.

(Romans 6:1 NRSV). Jan Harold Brunvand consoled us by assuring that "the truth never stands in the way of a good story."12 In the words of Edward Albee: "Good writers define reality; bad ones merely restate it. A good writer turns fact into truth; a bad writer will, more often than not, accomplish the opposite."13 In the process of writing that reality and telling our story, Aristotle suggested that "the greatest thing in style is to have a command of metaphor."14 If I might continue in that vein, fact is a truth without metaphor; but truth is a story form of memory told with myth and metaphor to bring the dry and inert bones of fact to life, to make those bones live again with prepositional sinews. "Memory is the crux of our humanity," wrote feminist Erica Jong. "Without memory we have no identities. That is really why I am committing an autobiography."15 Historians are those of us with social memory who commit our collective biographies in public without embarrassment or remorse. C. Robert Mesle 1987 JWHA Presidential Address16 In the JWHA presidential address (1987, Stone Church, Independence, Missouri) Robert Mesle taught us that what we literally say is not always what we actually mean. In the talk, tided "Sacred Fudge," he demonstrated that historical recipes we talk about, document, and describe are not what they seem to be. And this double-speak is not accidental but purposeful and intentional. "Divinity" is not about the beyond "high" up or in the "sky," nor is it even some sweet and sticky substance in a cooking pot. The historical recipes of the histories we live are not fudge, culinary instructions, or even the carefully described and skillful stirring to boil without burning. Our histories are about gathered families grouped in ceremonial occasions rehearsing the mystic bonds that connect them in warmth, relatedness, and love. Mesle's "Sacred Fudge" was not about a culinary recipe, a tasty sweet, a kitchen locale, or even an ecclesiastical Eucharist, but really and symbolically about the ultimate bonding of lives and events in basic familial settings that 12 Harold Brunvand, The Truth Never Stands in the Way of a Good Story ( Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2000). 13 Edward Albee, Saturday Review (4 May 1966), as found at www.bardeby.com/ 63/97/ 8997.html. 14 Aristode as found at www.carlhose.com/ famouswords.htm. 15 Erica Jong as quoted in The Quotable Book Lover ; Ben Jacobs and Helena Hjalmarsson, editors (New York: The Lyons Press, 1999), 43. 16 C.

Sinai and Cumorah, Smith and Rigdon, Book of Mormon and bundles of "revelations" are symbolic (not literal) just like "Sacred Fudge" or the recipe is symbolic. Sound history in the present or the future depends on how well we learn to read - really read - and properly interpret those historical recipes from former ceremonial occasions. My guess is that while everyone enjoyed Mesle on that evening, only a handful in that friendly Stone Church audience were fully and accurately interpreting the wide range of meanings Bob was suggesting to us. His was a historical interpretation done by a process theologian speaking highly poetically on multiple, simultaneous levels. Mesle's insightful knowledge and use of the poetic and symbolic nature of language was a relevant and powerful antidote for so much wooden literalism about religious language in the early church (1827-1846), the early Reorganization, and it still plagues much of contemporary Latter-day Saint (LDS) language and belief. In a relativistic and postmodern era, a fundamentalist^ insistence on linguistic literalism is simply no longer intellectually respectable. While the LDS have many fine contributions to make in the familial, social, educational, and organizational/managerial spheres, they will never make any major or distinguished contributions to modern theological and/or philosophical discussions so long as they maintain their rigid, restrictive, literalistic use of religious language. Among the many reasons why Professor Sterling McMurrin deserves to be remembered and honored (which is what JWHA is endeavoring to do) is his courage and insight in transcending the old literalistic, theological, and philosophical constraints of traditional LDS thought and language. Robert Mesle was the JWHA president when he delivered "Sacred Fudge." He is not a historian; he's a theologian. But he made a most insightful and subtle contribution to JWHA and to the church's historical task: he challenged us to a richer, more complex, and more symbolic understanding of language, and especially language in rehearsing our history and religious history. In Danny Jorgensen's 1997 JWHA presidential address and at the Saturday morning plenary panel on historiography, he reminded us that Latter-day Saint-ism has misused its language and its stories. "Both RLDS conservatives and liberals suffer from the modern tendency to see our sacred</page><page sequence="9">8 John Whitmer Historical Association journal 200 1 myths as history, rather than as powerful ways of symbolically envisioning ourselves as part of a sacred cosmos."'7 Danny Jorgensen, Paul Edwards, and I have all called for a re-telling and re-writing of our myths and our stories as relevant contemporary testimonies about our identities and our perceived relation to the sacred. That suggestion requires sensitive, personal, and poetic uses of language. But it is symbolic language and is quite different from doing history and religious history. Since its inception, the Latter-day Saints have had a pronounced tendency to want to literalize their myths, their scriptures, and their testimonies - reducing them to historicisms, empiricisms, dogmas, and spiritual irrelevance. We need the wisdom of letting history be history, and myths, stories, and testimonies be some other personal, poetic, and subjective vehicle. But LDS and RLDS aren't alone in misunderstanding different religious languages and imposing false literalisms and historicisms on their traditions and beliefs. My unscientific but not uninformed guess would be that over half of America's church-going public are far too literal and not brightly literate, religiously speaking. However the LDS have out-literalized most of the fundamentalistic evangelicals by contending, with Joseph Smith Jr., that God actually has "body parts and passions." Most conservative Protestant bodies don't go quite that far. This is a statement that, in a scientific, technological, electronic, postmodern age, is empirically and absolutely non- sensical. It has no sense or data to support it. Therefore, render it in a story or poetic realm or drop it. And let's not let Joseph Jr. off the hook by making him out as some sort of earlier Whiteheadian process thinker or Jamesian pragmatist or Wittgensteinian postmodernist. He wasn't any of those things. Forward-looking, perhaps, but he wasn't in any of the mentioned modern or postmodern modes. Neither was he an earlier Barthian, which is what RLDS theologian-in-residence Tony Chvala-Smith would have liked. Language is metaphorical, symbolic, and paradigmatic: certainly scriptural language at the very least. If Genesis 1:1 - 2:4 and Genesis 2:5 and following are to be understood literally and scientifically, then one has to be thrown out. Their two orders of creation are chronologically inconsistent. If they are understood as two Hebrew and Jewish myths that speak a story form of truth (not literal, empirical "fact") then there is no problem of chronological consistency. In "Circumcise, then, the foreskin of your heart" (Deuteronomy 10:16 NRSV), a sixth-century B.C.E. Jewish prophet without modern 17 Danny Jorgensen, "Beyond Modernity: The Future of the RLDS Church," John Whitmer Historical Association Journal 1 8 (1998): 16.</page><page sequence="10">From "Sacred Fudge" to "Christ-Centered Boredom" 9 education or empirical science was speaking a powerful Jewish metaphor about the existential life of faith. As I read him, he clearly knew he was referring to the symbolic excising of the foreskin of the phallus, and he was not suggesting heart surgery! If a non-theologically educated, pre-scientific Jewish prophet over 2,500 years ago was this self-conscious about the imaginative and symbolic use of religious and theological language, how can we possibly excuse, forgive, and tolerate the simplistic, unsophisticated literalization of scriptural and religious concepts in an age when our junior and senior high students openly entertain electronic and "virtual" realities quite outside the ken of literal, mechanical, technical, "common sense" realism of a former day? Electronic and "virtual realities" are not literal and virtually non-finite ("infinite") in not having spatially measurable quanta, that is, not having feet and inches, pounds and ounces, quarts and gallons, square inches and cubic yards. Relevant and pervasive electronic communication and "virtual realities" themselves compel us all even on the most popular levels to think of "God" and spirituality on a non-tangible, non-spatial level of "non-finity" and non-anthropomorphism. Mesle was right to challenge us on our use of language. His "sacred fudge" had no specific recipe, no real sugar content to threaten diabetics, no cocoa bean stimulants, and no cholesterol! "Sacred Fudge" could be tasted and enjoyed by all. Mesle was such a carefully gifted poet and storyteller when he spoke to us on a variety of levels of meaning and virtually all of them were non-literal ' Paul M. Edwards's 1997 Sterling McMurrin Lecture In the inaugural Sterling McMurrin Lecture, Paul Madison Edwards focused on what he referred to as "Christ-centered boredom," which had bothered him when he thought about "the RLDS approach to its historical task, both institutionally and professionally."18 In my own words, it amounted to the loss of a convicting common religious experience and the subsequent loss of a convincing story, myth, or testimony among the RLDS. His position was this: "The RLDS Church has become increasingly boring to even the most faithful. The reason is that the story told by the church does not match the experience of the members."19 It is a loss of spirituality and historicity as well, because it relates to the 18 Paul M. Edwards, "Christ-centered Boredom: History and Historians," John Whitmer Hist√≥rica/ Association Journal 1 8 (1998): 22. 19 Ibid.</page><page sequence="11">10 John Whitmer Historical Association Journal 2001 church's "historical approach" in that history as the church uses and presents it "reflects a posture which promotes the value of organizational security over spirituality."20 Mystics, visionaries, pilgrims, monks, and nuns, those with successful religious and spiritual quests, perennially stress and testify to humility, finitude, and insecurity. They do not deny nor flee from it but affirm and embrace it. They faithfully and courageously accept their vulnerabilities and limitations. Is there a contradiction here between saints who embraces their insecurity and the institutional church that strives for security? What about: "those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will save it?" (Luke 9:24 NRSV). If Edwards is right in overtly seeking "institutional security," is the RLDS Church losing its spiritual life and soul? Does it need a new name - and perhaps a new soul - because it has lost its former one and has yet to discover (or re-discover) a new spiritual vision and religious identity? You answer this for yourself. I cannot answer it for you. But it certainly makes one wonder! If accurate, Edwards's interpretation is qualitatively different from and superior to one based on (like Launius's and Walton's) sheer loss of numbers in membership and contributions, as important as those are to denominational survival in voluntaristic America. Edwards's thesis is poignant and serious in that it strikes home to the heart of the RLDS identity - religious and spiritual - or the lack thereof. Edwards's lecture, coupled with Danny Jorgensen's presidential address, has haunted me since the 1997 JWHA in Kirtland, Ohio. It troubled and perplexed me all the more to hear the president of the RLDS Church say at a JWHA meeting at Camp Doniphan in Missouri last fall that he didn't know what "Christ-centered boredom" meant. What a moment! History is not only interpretation, it is also dialogue. We who do historical study stand on the shoulders of others who have preceded us, and we are forever in their debt. History is a dialogue with former historians and other living colleagues in the present who critique us and assist us in our efforts for more and improved historical studies. It was telling, to me at least, that in the arena of RLDS historical interpretation and dialogue, the president of the RLDS Church didn't understand the interpretive thesis and concept of the director of Temple School working one floor below him in the same building, and somehow couldn't or didn't make a phone call down to him, or, better still, ask for an office visit to discuss and 20 Edwards, 22.</page><page sequence="12">From "Sacred Fudge" to "Christ-Centered Boredom" 11 get clear the meaning of this important perception, however accurate or inaccurate it might be. In my fifteen years of activity with the JWHA, I can now say with absolute confidence, that for improved historical interpretation and productivity there needs to be more and better critical dialogue in the RLDS headquarters itself, and there needs to be more and better dialogue in the JWHA, and that requires the efforts of a lot of us, not just a small and courageous handful. For RLDS survival, there needs to be more young men and women who have dynamic religious experiences and find new ways of telling fresh stories and inventing new myths, and they need the ecclesiastical freedom and inspiration to tell these testimonies in their own ways. For the health and survival of RLDS identity and also for the JWHA, there needs to be more critical and more far-reaching historical interpretation. One of my aims is to draw attention to and participate in this on-going historical interpretation, historigraphical dialogue, and open critical inquiry. Mario S. de Pillis's 1966 Dialogue Article Mario de Pillis declared and documented with clarity and discrimination that the search for religious authority - the recovery of lost authority for present identity and future paradise (and success) - was the central thrust and issue of early Mormonism (although it was central to a mix and variety of complex concepts and concerns of early LDSism to be sure). Indeed, the origin and whole doctrinal development of Mormonism under the Prophet may be characterized as a pragmatically successful quest for religious authority, a quest that he shared with many other anxious rural Americans of his time, class, and place. Historians who do not take this quest seriously enough to examine it do not take Mormonism seriously enough for rigorous historical inquiry.21 De Pillis's perception is so primal and foundational for an understanding of early Mormonism that it will never be displaced or overturned by subsequent revisionist historiography. A very substantial measure - and perhaps the most telling measure - of contemporary Mormonism is to compare and contrast what has become of this "quest for religious authority" of the early period with the current LDS and RLDS denominations in the year 2000. Both have outgrown much of their strident evangelistic exclusivism and sectarian authoritarianism and have really become American denominations. The RLDS denominationalized earlier and has done it more thoroughly than the LDS, but the present LDS 21 Mario de Pillis, "The Quest for Religious Authority and the Rise of Mormonism," Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 1 (Spring 1966): 88.</page><page sequence="13">12 John Whitmer Historical Association Journal 2001 are doing it as well. Both have transcended what de Pillis referred to as a fierce "contempt for sectarianism"22 and pluralism that appeared as early as the Book of Mormon. Both the LDS and RLDS have diminished domestic evangelical growth (even the LDS) and any real evangelical growth is now international, which would suggest and will result in continued and even greater religious change and cultural diversity. At the 1993 MHA meeting, several JWHA members (Dick Howard, Bill Russell, Bill Morain, and I) delivered papers addressing and describing fast- moving changes in the RLDS institution, which were visibly threatening and disturbing to many LDS historians visiting from "the West." They were openly speculating about what similar alterations and challenges might do to the LDS "out West," and I was taken back by their puzzled reactions. However since that time considerable change has occurred in the LDS Church. My Terre Haute friend, neighbor, and Indiana State University colleague in theater, Gary Stewart, gave a historical memoir of his British mission in 1957-1959 and documented it using winsome and graphic personal accounts of the beginning of an era of tremendous shift in the LDS belief, practice, and evangelism. He presented this later that summer (August 2000) at the Sunstone Conference in Salt Lake City (and I'm assuming it will be eventually published). Whether self-conscious about those changes, or willing to admit them or not, the LDS have been de-sectarianized to a great degree and are becoming denominationalized as well. My neighbors Gary and Diana Stewart have aided me in coming to a rich insight about the LDS, in contrast to the RLDS. I noticed in Gary and Diana's plays and lives that they had, and lived out of, an LDS and Great Basin subculture. Even after the loss of theological affirmation, religious conviction, and congregational affiliation, there is a Mormon subculture to assume, live out of, and fall back on, very much like Judaism and Jewish subcultures. In contrast, the RLDS do not and never did have one. Following doctrinal disenchantment and religious skepticism, all there is to keep former RLDS members in some way associated is through the basic, existential, brotherly or sisterly bonds of friendship. Perhaps the RLDS should have re- named themselves the "Friendship of Former and Future Saints" rather than the nondescript "Community of Christ." 22 de PiUis, 88.</page><page sequence="14">From "Sacred Fudge" to "Christ-Centered Boredom" 13 W. Grant McMurray's 1999 JWHA Address When W. Grant McMurray addressed the JWHA, I thought he picked a most appropriate topic - "History and Mission in Tension: A View from Both Sides" - and presented it with a respectable degree of balance and perception.23 Certainly the assessment of history was granted a significant role to play in an ecclesiastical institution's identity and mission. However, when I watched, albeit from afar, the president's leadership and World Conference action, it appeared to me to be the most far-reaching and symbolic action to date of the RLDS Church actually endeavoring to change, escape, and forget its own history, not just a re-telling, re-visioning, or creative re-interpretation. As an American religious historian, I was saddened. To me, the church was choosing deliberately to shed its own history, historical experience, its name and even concepts that once gave it identity and distinction. To a historian this dramatic and perhaps even dangerous move was far more than the ordination of women or its departure from genetic leadership of Smith blood. This threatens the identity, future, and mission of the movement far more than quantitative changes like the loss of membership and loss of revenue that Launius and Walton pointed to. This was qualitative change. One can be a small movement and still have solid and distinctive identity, like the Unitarian-Universalists, the Shakers, or the Quakers. But to me the whole-scale departure from and loss of one's institutional history is more akin to the demise (call it suicide, murder, or euthanasia) of an institution. Loss of history is a loss of identity. Even if possible, it is not totally desirable. Watching that action, I have now joined the ranks of those who conceive that the RLDS historical existence, meaning, identity, and viability are being jeopardized, certainly in the long run if not the short run. Whether the church leaders made a deliberate decision to do so or not, in Danny Jorgensen's terms, the RLDS Church has left the creeping secularization of modernity and is marching backward into postmodernity with no real guideposts from its generative past.24 And so now the real question and challenge come: Do RLDS members really know how to courageously and creatively deal with postmodernity, ready or not? I don't think anyone knows. I certainly don't. But I think the pressure and test have certainly been hastened by the April 2000 Conference action. If a clerical leader desires to be a corporation president and chief 23 W.

But if he/ she wishes to be a prophetic leader, he/she needs to study history, consult religion, and perhaps hire more church history staff. It concerned me a great deal that when the current RLDS leader became president, he stopped attending JWHA and MHA meetings, reading research papers, participating on panels, and other activities. I thought last year might signal a change in this regard. If the RLDS wish to be a prophetic church and people, they should re-appropriate their history, much the way W. Paul Jones suggested, for example, with the concept of "restoration." History should be de-literalized, de-historicized, re-created; it should not be expunged or repressed. W. Paul Jones's 1996 address JWHA Spring Banquet (and the MHA/JWHA joint meeting in Kingston, Ontario, June 1995) While he is not a JWHA, MHA, or RLDS historian, I cannot resist recalling the insightful address of W. Paul Jones at the MHA/JWHA in Kingston, at the JWHA spring banquet, and printed in the JWHA Journal. He appreciated, reinterpreted, and re-envisioned RLDS history without trying to re-pristinate or reproduce it on the one hand or endeavoring to expunge or repress it on the other. He divined the concepts of the past that could be re- envisioned and re-projected for the future. He called for a re-telling of the church's stories, he called for a "re-symbolization as an imaginative re- appropriation"25 of the sagas, testimonies, and shared experiences of Smith and the Saints, without wasting any more time trying to discover the "real" Joseph, the "real" Moroni, or the "real" golden plates that are will-o'-the- wisps at this point anyway. We need the renewal of myth, story, religious experience, testimony, and history all at the same time, and there is no problem or contradiction in doing so with each and all of them. "Life without myth is likely to be dead and sterile, while religion without myth is a flat, rational substitute for the real thing."26 Professor Jones exhibited more real faith in the RLDS possibilities of re- mythologization, re-sacralization, and historical re-interpretation than the institutional church itself seems to have demonstrated in the last decade of 25 W.

I commend a re-reading of Professor Jones to JWHA and RLDS audiences; he certainly deserves such re-consideration. It will be a good tonic for the present amnesia that seems to be fogging the institutional denomination. Richard P. Howard's 1999 Sterling McMurrin Lecture27 In the third Sterling McMurrin Lecture, Richard Howard pointed out what he interpreted as the "peace gene" in the LDS and RLDS traditions. He did so with imagination, poetry, passion, and even music. Those who heard him saluted his aspiration, his enviable ethical imperative, and his cleverly crafted textual achievement. In fact, he succeeded in documenting his case better than I thought he could. Nevertheless, it has to be admitted outright for historical clarity and accuracy, whatever "peace gene" Howard is recognizing and explicating in very recent RLDS denominationalism was an extremely "recessive" one, at the very best, back in the early nineteenth- century origins of the movement. In its first generation, the Latter-day Saint movement was characterized by evangelical assertiveness and theological aggression, deriving from Old Testament imagery, Calvinism, millenarianism, sectarianism, and American "nativism" and expansionism (with its twin notions of "manifest destiny" and "destiny under God"). Much of the evangelical and religious rhetoric of Joseph Smith, Sidney Ridgon, Parley Pratt, and Brigham Young was stridently assertive and extrovertive. It could have been said of these men what Martin Luther suggested about Thomas M√ºntzer: that they "swallowed the Holy Spirit, feathers and all!"28 They felt themselves to be religious "giants" announcing the only authentic "gospel" and truth to men and women on Earth and helping to roll the "stone [of the true church that] was cut from the mountain not by hands" (Daniel 2:45 NRSV) through the entire globe. I cannot recall ever reading any of the rhetoric of this first generation of Mormon leadership that suggested to me a "peace gene." Being a historian and speaking in the presence of other historians in a historical society, while I acknowledge Howard's total intellectual freedom to offer any sort of historical revision he wishes, I think intellectual honesty behooves him to admit just how "recessive" the "peace gene" really is and just how relatively recent and under what new circumstances it has emerged. 27 "Quest for Traces of the 'Peace Gene'," audiocassette available from JWHA, 427 West 70th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64113-2022. 28 Martin Luther as found at www.britannica.com/eb/article?eu=55671.</page><page sequence="17">16 John Whitmer Historical Association Journal 2001 I realize his time was limited for doing this, but without this larger historical context it presents a faulty and an ahistorical perspective of the interplay between peace and war, submission and aggression, and sectarianism and denominationalism in the full history and identity of the Latter-day Saint movement. The more valuable and illuminating historical view is one that provides proper balance and perspective even when one is treating small, minor, overlooked, or "recessive" elements in a much greater overall picture. Improper overemphasis of one small corner of the picture can offer just as much distortion as absolute and factual inaccuracies. Good historical interpretation is one that provides a proper and balanced interpretive perspective. That said, I want to say I profited from the nuance and creativity provided by Howard's historical revisionism. Clearly his major data and best references were from quite recent RLDS experience. In that light, he missed an important datum, to my thinking, when he failed to employ and explicate the design, the symbolism, the aesthetics, and the naturalness of the RLDS Temple. It would strengthen Howard's case considerably, and I was waiting for him to use it before he concluded. The Temple is an architectural and empirical "Exhibit A" for the new hope and aspiration of Community of Christ identity. I encourage Howard to extend that part of his interpretation and case in the future. Isleta L. Pemen≈•s 1994 JWHA Presidential Address29 In the JWHA presidential address in Nauvoo, Illinois, Lee Pement actually preceded and pre-empted Paul Edwards's employment of the diagnosis of "boredom," not just in and with the RLDS, but in the JWHA and the doing of Mormon history. Apparently, and to her credit, she was quite a ways ahead of many of the rest of us in sensing and reacting to this "deep malaise" and despondency. I can now acknowledge and entertain her insight in retrospect with greater historical experience and deeper appreciation. Barbara Hands Bernauer's 1999 JWHA Presidential Address311 In the JWHA presidential address at Camp Doniphan, Missouri, Barbara 29 Isleta L. Pement, "The Boring of Mormonism," John Whitmer Hist√≥rica l Association Journal 15 (1995): 3-8. M&gt; Barbara J.

History and identity are always intertwined at the deepest levels and Barbara offered us a gentle, calm, well- reasoned demonstration of this being done in our presence. What a fuller, richer, deeper heritage the RLDS Church would have if all members had that kind of ready grasp and understanding of their history and place within the context of the movement. What a church with a powerful identity! The Historiographical Challenge I have been flattered that a couple of JWHA members have called me the "historiographical president" of JWHA because I made that one of the major aims and goals of my time in office. I knew I could not have a very large effect on the overall association, but I wanted to have a few specific targets in mind. I want to thank the people who helped me with this historiographical venture, such as Barbara Bernauer, Norman Bernauer, Mike Riggs, Danny Jorgensen, Paul Edwards, Mario de Pillis, Val Avery, and many more. Right or wrong, it has been my mounting perception that in both the MHA and the JWHA, among LDS historians and RLDS historians, one of the two or three challenges for the next decade or two is serious, intensified, radical, and fresh historiographical interpretations of Mormon and Saint history, inclusively understood. Too many of the previous historiographical perspectives have been too narrow, too "loyal," too institutional, too in- grown, too "self-referential" (to borrow Mario de Pillis's apt phrase), too "Great-Basin oriented" for the LDS, and too "Jacksocentric" for the RLDS/Community of Christ. I have tried to exhibit some of the re- interpretation in my own addresses and articles, including this one, and I have tried to lift up some of the re-interpretations of others I think deserve some attention. I hope and trust all of us will continue. JWHA historians, presidents, presenters, and interpreters have been at work offering us a variety of interesting and relevant contributions to JWHA's continued historiographical interpretations and approaches. They are legion, often at different ends of various spectra: from "sacred fudge" to "Christ-centered boredom"; from sectarian "restorationism" to rather non- descript denominationalism and ecumenicity; from decades of literalist historicism (literalizing our myths as a substitute for solid history) all the way to historylessness; from evangelical assertiveness/aggressiveness (an occasional "holy war") to the detection or perhaps "implantation" of a "peace gene"; from an architecture of authority (here and hereafter) to an</page><page sequence="19">1 8 John Whitmer Historical Association Journal 200 1 architecture of peace and universality; from a "chosen people to "righteous remnant" to "restored" people and church, to a "reorganized" institution, to a denominationalized RLDS, to a non-national, ahistorical, ecumenical "Community of Christ"; from a patriarchal hierarchy and theocracy of the "restored true priesthood" to the democratization of the priesthood, and even the "feminization" of leadership and the church itself. We have been at work, as this brief list constitutes quite a broad array of different and imaginative interpretations. There is no sameness or simplicity here. It will be interesting and fun - intellectually and historically - to see where the JWHA interpretive motifs and orientations are in ten to twenty years, certainly somewhere quite different from where we are at the moment. Random Suggestions for Future Research I wish to offer some suggestions or "bait" for some future research and investigation by JWHA members and other historians. I will offer them in the form of proposed assertions or suggested historiographical interpretations to invite, lead, and guide research. Perhaps they have merit, and perhaps not, but they constitute "grist" for the mill. 1. Perhaps the ordination of women (and so many women at that) to the priesthood in the RLDS Church is not an indication of the democratization of the RLDS, but in the light of so many male priesthood members growing older, becoming inactive and/or less effective, being superannuated or retiring, and not being replaced by other males, what we are witnessing is something more like the feminization of the RLDS Church and the priesthood. (This was actually first suggested to me by Paul M. Edwards in response to my own earlier historiographical claim that it constituted "democratization." Now, about five to ten years later, I am not so certain. Hence, my challenge for re- interpretation and investigation.) 2. Rather than re-interpreting, re-visioning, and re-appropriating its history, the RLDS is actually giving up and abandoning its history, becoming historyless, and therefore, bereft of identity. Is this so? 3. The newly enacted nomenclature, "Community of Christ," is in fact a name assisting in the loss of a distinctive religious and historical identity of the RLDS community of faith and actually lends empirical support to the thesis of Roger D. Launius and George Walton from the 1997 JWHA conference meeting in Kirtland, Ohio, in fact it lends more support than simply the numerical count of membership (in this case loss of membership).</page><page sequence="20">From "Sacred Fudge" to "Christ-Centered Boredom" 19 4. While the numerical and evangelistic growth of both the LDS and RLDS churches are now no longer domestic but international in scope, the basic characters of these denominational institutions still seem to be American and Western in content, structure, values, and existentialist symbolism. If the LDS and/or RLDS members were truly "de- Americanized" and shorn of their telltale "American," parochial, cultural trappings and features, would there be anything universal, non-parochial left, ultimately? We wonder! 5. At some future point we need a thorough, balanced, and integrated intellectual history of Mormonism identifying and describing the tremendous variety of strands of thought and belief, religion and culture that went into the variegated make-up of the early Latter-day Saint mind and movement. It was anything but simple, and no potential assessment of its real complexity, that I have seen, has even begun to do it justice. It will require a truly broadly educated and disciplined thinker to make this contribution. The early movement was so complex that is not surprising that some of its parts came flying apart after the Nauvoo period and this "axis period" of martyrdom, leadership disputes, and loss of prophetic oracle. De Pillis has agreed that we need to re-assess this early period as well. 6. Consequently and relatedly, we need a truly pluralistic history of the Reorganization. It was not simple, singular, or united in agreement over a host of matters. No RLDS history has plumbed and articulated this cacophony of different Reorganite possibilities, which were eventually muffled by prophetic theocracy, very much like pluralism, democracy, and diversity of the early church were suppressed, cut off, or silenced, like Hiram Page. We need a truly multi-faceted history of the RLDS/ Community of Christ. These are a few suggestions, challenges, or topics I offer to eager, ambitious, and willing historical students and interpreters. Bon chance, bon voyage! The Ecstatic "Movement of Truth" for the Historian One of the most powerful, memorable, and satisfying senses of the historian is that tremendous state of mind - fullness of mind - when we've discovered and are reading a primary document for the first time for ourselves, perhaps the first time for anyone in the past decade, the past generation, the past century, or for the first time!

Suddenly real data prompts sparks, fire, and light to our living minds and hearts! Our breasts are bursting with excitement, and our entire beings thirst for knowledge and truth. And we actually ache and yearn to communicate this insight and these data to our colleagues, the sooner the better! This is the moment of the historian's "eureka," and that kind of movement and experience will fuel the researching, re-thinking, re-visioning, and re-writing history for a lifetime! That is the moment of illumination and enlightenment that unites us in our historical enterprises and confederation. That is the pivotal moment for which we work, strive, and hope. It is a moment that not only has an epistemology and rationality to it; it has an aesthetic and an ethicality as well! That is the moment for which historians long and yearn, and from which all good and sound historical hermeneutics are born. I wish us all more of those good and enduring moments. Conclusion (and Refrain) I am the father of Aaron (and Christa), and I have never been a son of Melchisedek. I was birthed from an RLDS mother's womb, but I sojourned my life in a foreign land, dispersed from the "chosen people," living among alien people with different gods and goddesses, but they have shared their stories, sanctuaries, food, and fudge with me. "I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among people of unclean lips" (Isaiah 6:5 NRSV), but we have forgiven one another's sins, shared our sufferings, and shared our fellowship just as if we might have been in the company of "the chosen." Like Dr. Rieux in The Plague said: "I feel more fellowship with the defeated than with saints. Heriosm and sanctity don't really appeal to me, I imagine. What interests me is being a man."31 We can become like Camus' existential Sisyphus, ever chained to his rock, but he learns to accept and live with the rock and struggles of life, and "one must imagine Sisyphus happy."32 1 am the father of Aaron (and Christa), I have never been the son of Melchisedek and my grandchildren are "Gentiles." But I have become historically content with who I am and have come to imagine myself "happy."
