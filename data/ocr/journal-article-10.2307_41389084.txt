<plain_text><page sequence="1">Violence, Body, Text: The Hazards of an Ecological Hermeneutic* Klaus Poenicke In a well-known essay, "Die Wirklichkeit der Fiktion," Wolf- gang Iser has made what is, to my knowledge, the first consistent attempt to use cybernetics and the model of self-regulating sys- tems to define the "servo-mechanism" of feedback enabling a process of communication between text and reader that is both self-evolving and controlled.1 He extends this strategy to relocate fiction itself. Fictional texts are posited no longer in opposition to, but rather in communication with reality - a communication that can be defined functionally, pragmatically, even, in a sense, anthropologically. Thus fictional texts constitute neither an imi- tation of nor a "deviation" from the dominant system of inter- preting the world, but join in a continuous process of "comple- mentarization," of what Iser calls the Sinndefizite , the gaps, omissions, silences, repressions, that contour the shadow or "oth- er" of that system. The production and reception of fiction, then, signifies a "balancing operation" ( eine " Ausgleichsoperation '). It implies the regulatory mechanism of "negative feedback" which functions - it is important to note - both to reveal and to cover up the deficiencies of meaning that might rupture the system. This is an instructive conception, and its functionalist ap- proach lays to deserved rest many die-hard fictions concerning *This essay appeared in slightly different form in Amerikastudien 31.1 (1986): 173-186.</page><page sequence="2">Spring-Summer 1987 5 the "ontological" opposition of reality and fiction. It invites fur- ther substantiation and extension, especially - I think - with regard to literature in a mode of rebellion and protests. One might point to the work of Fredric Jameson and Christian En- zensberger or to Tony Tanner's notion of the carnival, based on Bakhtin, to point out how elegantly systems of some elasticity may create a space to "frame" art's cry of protest, turning it into an unconscious act of affirmation and complicity.2 In the seven- teenth century the Lord of Misrule at the English Court, as Slotkin reminds us, was a royal officer - and in many disguises he is with us still.3 Yet Iser's functionalization of literature as an inbuilt system of "negative" cultural feedback may still look just a bit too smooth, too much "servo" and "mechanism," not to remind us of the very Newtonian "machine paradigm" which cyberneticians like Norbert Wiener, even if themselves still too much oriented toward "flow balances," set out to dynamize.4 It might be neces- sary to emphasize even more the crucial phenomenon of feed- back. It is feedback which, according to Gregory Bateson in his influential speculations about the ecology of mind as a multiple mode of interaction between the self and its so-called environ- ment, creates the fundamental difference between logical and biological systems. What comes in with the "bio" - and often with a bang - is the factor of time. Time is what passes between the emission of a signal demanding correction and the actual execution of that correction. The fact is as obvious as it is conse- quential. For while the feedback correction is executed, the situa- tion that originally demanded it may have drastically changed.5 This, however, has been a major factor in what Odo Marquard, in a provocative defense of "Art as Antifiction," has called the pro- gressive "fictionalization" of the so-called "real world."6 Under the relentless whip of Wachstum and Warentausch , change violently accelerates. Nevertheless, our scripts and scenarios of balanced economic and social growth compulsively hold on to their Kon- stanzfiktionen. Thus, they ever more often turn into "self-destroy- ing prophesies," costly symptoms of a collapse of logocentrism which two decades ago John Barth diagnosed as "cosmopsis"7 and which Odo Marquard terms tachogene Weltfremdheit ."8 It is this blindness induced by a compulsive urge toward stability which has promoted the insight, most cogently urged by Ilya Prigogine, Erich Jantsch, and other exponents of recent systems theory, that balance may be about the worst thing that</page><page sequence="3">6 Discourse 9 can happen to a living system. Balance, in this sense, might well be found to circumscribe a semantic field not too much different from that referred to by the taboo word "closure" in recent French theory. Thomas Pynchon, I assume, was pointing to something quite similar when he aligned the compulsive, death- bound quality of closed technological or social systems with the "deep conservatism of Feedback."9 On the contrary, according to Erich Jantsch's fascinating Die Selbstorganisation des Universums , what a healthy and self-evolving ecosystem needs is the highest possible measure of instability. Courting imbalance might even mean countenancing the destabilizing, "wild vibrations" of "posi- tive feedback" - that nightmare which haunts Newtonians and systems engineers alike. For only the most rude and periodic ruptures of symmetry permit the evolution of new, often more complex and rich forms of organization in a process of perma- nent "autopoiesis."10 But what does it mean to live in a system of permanent imbalance, where ruptures of symmetry are recurrent and radi- cal, signalling themselves by exponential increase in the produc- tion of entropy and waste?1 1 Where the art of prognostication, a particularly valued branch of our costly Wissenschaftsbetrieb tends, due to a growing neglect of the interrelatedness of things, to fall back ever more often not only behind the occasional wisdom of the shaman but also simple common sense? Let me venture two suggestions. One concerns our orientation toward the future, the other our actualizations of the past and what we periodically re- invent as its "history." As far as the future is concerned, we might well have to re- create a more dramatic conception of time. This may mean ad- mitting, even inviting a fuller consciousness of time as the living space of Vernetzung , of infinitely interacting feedback, hence as a space of growing unpredictability, threat, and possible pain. We may have to force ourselves to re-enter precisely those forbidden landscapes of anxiety which we most compulsively attempt to cover with our many-colored maps of order, meaning, Rechenbar- keit. Herman Melville, in his little-known Israel Potter ; presents an image of Benjamin Franklin which almost iconically denotes some possible sources for this repression. He has Franklin - who, Max Weber's obvious distortions notwithstanding, still epit- omizes that incipient bourgeois instrumentalism which has cul- minated in our age's dreams of high tech, omnipotence, and total Machbarkeit - pose before a map on which everywhere the word "desert" is crossed out. But what Franklin chose to forget, cultur-</page><page sequence="4">Spring-Summer 1987 7 al critics from Melville, Lawrence, Pound, and Norman O. Brown to the poststructuralists - or, from quite different angles, Saussure, Korzybsky, or Bateson - insistently remind us: the map is not the territory.12 It may have been our very insistence on the map, on the validity of our fictions of directedness and order, that most helped to extend the space of that "other" which now is forcing its way so ominously back into cultural discourse. It may have been, as James Hillman suggests, our sharp focusing of the light of logos which, cutting into the diffuse, primordial grayness of the arche- type, actually created the blackness of that shadow. Since the romantics, the mystery has shifted from what lies behind the map to why we should so desperately need the map. Perhaps in taking upon ourselves the awful burden of be- coming, as humans, the ultimate source of justice and freedom on the planet, we have in equal measure impaired our ability to countenance the reality of our own violence. Our tendencies to blur this issue may also have to do with the fact that much of our political rhetoric still points to a metadiscourse whose basic text is symbiosis, whereas our economic and, more and more unaba- shedly, also our educational rhetoric points to a metadiscourse oriented toward competition and territorialization. Instead of facing the implications of this highly visible contradiction, we prefer to bury it under ever more abstract "necessities" and rules. What dramatically enlarges the shadow might not be, then, the perhaps ineluctable dimension of violence itself, but rather our growing unwillingness to acknowledge our involvement. Why else should we harness such incredible energies into the effort of translating our specific individual and collective aggressions against other forms of life into general, "objective" rules, ex- tremely costly, high-entropy mandatas against personal responsi- bility? One mode of counteracting such strategies of evasion, critics of our present cultural and economic predicament insist, might be a more un-mediated attention to what is actually before our eyes - the local, the situative, the close-at-hand. We might, following GÃ¼nther Buck in his "Theorie der Praxis," finally have to forget Kant (and in a minor way also McLuhan) by beginning to put the example before the rule, our own concrete experience before our increasingly global abstractions.13 Only thus, it is assumed, we might salvage some sense of the real scope of those devastations which our reductionist myths of science, technology, and eco-</page><page sequence="5">8 Discourse 9 nomic "growth" (a word that before our very eyes is turning into a semantic obscenity) so successf ully manage to hide from us. For believers in the map, of course, this is the straight road into division, fragmentation, chaos. Erich Jantsch, however, who traces evolving forms from bio-chemical to cultural self-organiza- tion, comes up with very different findings. The more autonomy that individual subsystems achieve within an emerging larger system, the more this minus of central interference and control may, paradoxically, yield a plus of local structure, a higher level and intensity of organization within each subsystem.14 But Jantsch's model faces the same problems as any other we extrapo- late from "nature" to ensure a more sanely functioning social whole. How will it survive in a highly complex and quite different setting? a setting governed by vested interests so virulent and pervasive, that they have to this day stalled, almost without effort, even the most obvious measures for curbing our lethal pace of self-poisoning and waste? Hence facing the future under the auspices of autopoeisis and Vernetzung may still imply, above all, re-admitting forgotten feel- ings of involvement, anxiety, dependence. Re-learning them per- haps constitutes the most painful and paradoxical first step in deploying what will here, very tentatively be termed an ecological hermeneutic. The reason appears simple: trying not to have these feelings seems by now to bind up a much, indeed an insanely greater amount of our individual and collective energies than having them. And yet it would be foolish to deny that re-inviting anxiety may soon turn out to be an equally hazardous game. Has not anxiety, in the course of human history, been the single most effective tool of religious manipulation, political terror, and so- cial exploitation? If we cannot really enter the space of height- ened immediacy and awareness without it, we must take the utmost care to keep this space open, instead of clogging it with just another set of myths promising salvation from pain and the burden of time - including some distinctly "ecological" ones.15 But for the present, the reduction of anxiety and pain remains the major marketing device of Western logocentrism and the powerful urban-industrial structures it helped to shape. And it is these structures that today pose the most visible threat to the continuation of life - thus urging us to assess, with high priority, the ecological accountability of cultural discourse. This may well appear as the latest critical fad, a sanctimo- nious attempt to be carried by the tide of fashionable idiom, to corner, with some luck, even a new market in the flourishing</page><page sequence="6">Spring-Summer 1987 9 stock exchange of method and paradigm. It may well prove to be just that. But then it may also be one of the last fads the united culture industry will be permitted to exploit. In fact, to worry about whether we find it "interesting," useful or even desperately urgent to approach the manifestations of our society and culture from an "ecological" point of view may soon prove fairly irrele- vant - irrelevant that is, when posed against the horizon of an imminent (and possibly ultimate) lesson, the lesson of how eco- systems definitely do not work. I regret to sound apocalyptic because, unlike Ulrich Horstmann in his recent Das Untier : Konturen einer Philosophie der Menschen- Ãucht9XiS I would wish to avoid the shortcuts of apocalyptic thought. Visions of apocalypse, including the magisterial revela- tion of St. John, have always tended to be narcissistic phantasies of revenge and/or omnipotence, hence ultimately strategies of evasion. The attempt, therefore, to sketch some further possible dimensions of an ecological approach to culture should neither be misread as a self-righteous judgment on "what went wrong" nor as a facile "how-to" recipe for doing "better." Nor does this approach claim any radical originality. What it might yield at best is but an additional sharpening of our awareness, above all with regard to our prevalent strategies of order, the viability of our most conspicuous space-time defenses. Here, then, are three further suggestions aimed at more clearly defining and possibly functionalizing the "ecological": 1 ) The ecological has always, somehow, to do with a cost- efficiency account of our dominant modes of "order" (be it psychic, socio-cultural or concretely material). "Cost-effi- ciency" will probably appear as an unfortunate term, evok- ing - as it does - the most suspect, instrumentalist, pro- duction-oriented aspects of the science of ecology. I venture to stick with the term on two conditions: first, cost is under- stood as including, rigorously, all identifiable expense for whatever efficiency, in the widest sense, we may momentar- ily aim at, and secondly, cost is understood as referring to no absolute norm but to some tenuous unit of measurement, designed to grasp phenomena so evasive as the ebbs of cultural af firmation or, inversely, the flows of individual and collective malaise. 2) Historically, the ecological comes most dramatically into view when such modes of order become (if only in terms of previous widespread affirmation and agreement) exces- sive and, by consequence, lose stability or (to quote Jantsch) "symmetry." An unfailing measure of this instability is the</page><page sequence="7">10 Discourse 9 visible increase in energy consumption, often enacted as an increase in violence, which is then needed to maintain the dominant order. Due to the relentless workings of the sec- ond law of thermodynamics, this increase in violence, how- ever, adds to the depletion of the resources of material, social, and psychic energy, and thus causes an ever more rapid spreading of disorder, poisoning, and waste, a fact treated in perhaps too cavalier a manner by Erich Jantsch.17 It may finally follow an exponential or even hyperbolic curve, culminating in the wild vibrations of positive feed- back. At this stage the dominant mode of order, turned parasite, begins to destroy the life of its host and, by conse- quence, itself. 3) The ecological that comes to consciousness may al- ways be said to constitute already its own "trace." It signals so violent a deformation (or "symmetry rupture") of the un- conscious FlieBgleichgewichte (the intricately balanced feed- backs implied in the - real or assumed - "climax" state of the previous system), that reflection recalls this balance as a state already lost.18 This also helps to explain an apparent paradox: the fact that an ecological hermeneutic constitutes, almost by definition, a hermeneutic of crisis. What has been lost (or is nostalgically thought to have been lost) now reap- pears as an Utopian projection. On one level, no doubt our multiple ways of "ordering" experience express our creativity and freedom, our active and responsible participation in the "emergence" of life. For we do not have (in the sense of "suffer") an evolution, but - as Jantsch in a cogent criticism of Darwin reminds us - we are evolution.19 On another level, however, these attempts at ordering show themselves in equal measure as survival-oriented, defensive strategies that on yet a further level are intimately related to anxiety management. The sources of this anxiety replenish themselves, Antaeus-like, in every unsettling contact with the fact that we are involved in a network of infinitely interacting feed- back, or - to put it in more traditional terms - that we are still frail and vulnerable creatures, bound in the prison of our bodies, subject to infirmity, pain, and the inexorable rule of time. It is the body which, as a system of openness and high "imbalance," sustaining a living interchange with its ever-fluctu- ating, so-called "environment," perpetually produces feelings of anxiety.20 But with the triumph of Western logocentrism, techno- logical power, and material affluence, we seem to have lost resil- ience in accomodating these anxieties. This loss of resilience, of course, also intimately relates to our progressive debunking of religion and its time-tested myths of anxiety-management and compensation. But since even our "global" forms of order ever and again reveal themselves as instable and provisional, these</page><page sequence="8">Spring-Summer 1987 11 anxieties have a tendency to return. Wherever they do, two major controlling moves may be distinguished. The first and most obvious is to project them outward, instantly recoding them into aggression. This aggression has never yet failed to conjure up its Eternal Jew, ubiquitous white whale, black rapist, more recently, or even green party son of darkness (witness the quatr- iÃ¨me Reich phantasies of the French right-wing journalist Jean- Paul Picaper who has recently been seriously considered for an appointment at the University of Munich).21 But to the extent that such recoding does not succeed, aggressions come back with a vengeance, threatening to feed upon ourselves. So we devise other ways of fending them off, of repressing or marginalizing them. The second major move relates to this. It consists in a seeming paradox: to re-direct anxiety , recoded as aggression , toward the very body that originally gave it birth. This, however, is no longer the same body, but an invention, a fetish, a non-identical replica. From living nexus it has deteriorated into a fiction, an object inviting - to follow FoucaulÅ¥s obstinate investigations in The History of Sexuality - "territorialization."22 RenÃ© Girard, in his provocative speculations about violence and the sacred, has come to locate the origin of Greek tragedy in the deterioration of sacrificial myth.2* Tragedy dis-covers the myth's original violence, while at the same time veiling it again in ambivalence. Girard goes a long way toward unmasking the total arbitrariness of this violence. He comes to justify it, however, by what might with some perversity be called an ecological argu- ment: the successful pharmakon , who often ends up by identifying with his murderers, manages to draw upon his own body all the diffuse and undirected aggressions that threaten discord to the entire system of order. Harmony is thus restored as a "unanimity- minus-one."24 The flaw in Girard's cultural model is obvious. Assuming that a single member of a community, however "mar- ginal," may fall prey to arbitrary and collective violence, for how long can any other member of that community feel safe? Thus, the seeming - if cynical - "efficiency" of such a system will soon be outweighed by the costs implied in any rule of terror. It is tempting to speculate further on the question of wheth- er the texts of classical tragedy as well as those in a later and more secular mode have not always somehow of fered their "bodies" in a similar manner, creating a space not only (as Iser has convinc- ingly argued) of "complementarization" but for some surrogate enactment of aggression as well. Perhaps this is how literature most subtly functions as "negative feedback." Insofar as this con- stitutes a form of complicity, it has become a distinct subject of irony in those self-reflexive texts of postmodernism which seem to aim most violently at "positive feedback," at rupturing for</page><page sequence="9">1 2 Discourse 9 good the costly and entropie "symmetries" of present culture. Texts like William Burroughs's Naked Lunch , Joseph Heller's Something Happened, or Robert Coover's Public Burning come im- mediately to mind. The issue seems even more central to Joseph McElroy's A Smugglers Bible or Coover's extraordinary "Baby- Sitter" which I hope to give at least a passing glance. Literature itself, then, may be seen as having ambiguously aligned itself with our society's practices of splitting off, dividing, territorializing. I am here, however, referring especially to those practices which - moving from metonymy to symbolization, or as Girard puts it, from the surrogate to the ritual victim in a process of progressive abstraction and Uneigentlichkeit - have made a major scapegoat of the body. A re-vision of the history of American literature with the costs of order and an ecological hermeneutic in mind would certainly imply a sharpening of awareness for those manifold textual manifestations that turn against the openness and horizontality of the body as instable but living nexus of experience, feeling, thought. What appears most markedly in such texts is the tendency to create a "vertical" system, reducing the body to something "lower" in an evolving hierarchy of binary oppositions. The invention of such opposi- tions may be seen as the most important aspect of the territoriali- zation Foucault discusses. In this process of invention, desire strives to separate itself from anxiety, straining to enclose the latter into a fictive body which it then subjects to orgies of steadily proliferating control. This urge for recoding and bureaucratizing anxiety, howev- er, has not stopped at the limits of the individual human body. It has, most conspicuously, expanded in the direction of the "primi- tive," of "woman," and a thorough "feminization" of nature. Annette Kolodny, among others, has exposed the imperialism of this proliferation which points directly to some major roots of the present ecological crisis (in The Lay of the Land , she aptly evokes the insidiousness of this double territorialization).25 If, then, we are willing at least tentatively to admit that the body and all its synonyms of reduction may have been in some way used as bargaining objects for our anxieties, we will have to take immedi- ate account of the close alignment of these anxieties with yet another fiction. It concerns the castrating - or, in a more "oral" form, as Ned Lukacher suggests, the cannibalistic - powers of K(Ch)ronos.26 Reviewing the apocalyptic sacrifice of the world's body in "The Revelation of St. John" with this linkage in mind, we can hardly miss its major pay-off: the disempowerment of</page><page sequence="10">Spring-Summer 1987 13 K(Ch)ronos. While John in the end comes up with an insipid Disneyland projection of eternity, he manages to enhance it by one single, overwhelming promise - that "time will be no more." And both this desire and the basic formula for its satisfaction seem to be with us still. For even Pynchon's Faustian engineer and Rilke-lover Weissman, who is armed with all the potencies of twentieth-century technology and a healthy contempt for "the entropies of loveable but harebrained mother nature," can con- ceive of but a single way of escaping the anxieties of Vernetzung , "this cycle of infection and death."27 It is the rocket "crucifixion" of his lover Gottfried, or - to put it more bluntly - yet another sacrifice of the body as enactment of individual and/or collective violence. To inquire into how we have gone about territorializing the body obviously constitutes only one of the many conceivable moves toward activating an ecological hermeneutic. But since I have chosen to privilege this specific aspect, let me, in all brief- ness and quite eclectically, point to some areas of American litera- ture in which the costs of the dominant forms of order seem particularly excessive and often effect conceptions of the body. Interestingly enough, such excesses also seem to correlate quite highly with particularly reductive ways of experiencing and con- ceptualizing time. When and where, on the "virgin" continent of North Amer- ica, we might ask, did the territorialization of the body most conspicuously begin? The answer seems easy. We need only fol- low the accusing fingers of many cultural critics from Mencken, Lawrence, Waldo Frank, Fiedler to Norman O. Brown, to be pointed straight toward the Puritans. Their repressive attitude toward the body seems amply borne out also in less vociferous or partial texts - witness William Slotkin's carefully researched Regeneration Through Violence , and especially his sensitive inquir- ies into the "captivity myth."28 It appears that local ministers subjected white women, returning from Indian captivity, to al- most compulsive questionings. In these questionings, the red man looms large - not only as a barbarous, bloodthirsty infidel, but also as a powerful sexual presence. Imaged in the brawny vitality of the male Indian's body, the lawless life of the wilderness presents itself not only as a threat but also as an allurement, and thus as an even more disruptive menace. The power of this image is felt all the way to Hawthorne's Hester Prynne. In fact, Haw- thorne's obsessive concern with the "dark" lure of the physical</page><page sequence="11">14 Discourse 9 body has often been read as his most distinctly Puritan trait. Hawthorne traces the subject most directly back to its Puri- tan context, perhaps, in a deceptively muted story, "The Maypole of Merrymount." There, the "Dionysian" theme appears so toned down as to be barely visible. By emphasizing the transience of the revelries at Merrymount, evoking them as an ephemeral moment in the natural cycle, Hawthorne exerts a form of cen- sure which is as devastating as it is indirect. From quite unlikely historical materials, he distills an insistent elegy on the softness and vulnerability of the body, exposed to the pitiless onslaught of Time. He establishes this frame so skillfully, that grim EndicotÅ¥s castrating blow transforms, before our eyes, into an act of mercy. By chopping down the maypole, provocative symbol of desire traditionally invested in the body, he submits the two young lovers to a more "eternal" law. He thus - one might say by "pre- emption" - saves them from the castrating sickle of Chronos, the tyranny of secular time. Curiously enough, for the actual Puritans such radical exor- cism of the body seems not to have been the real, or at least certainly not the major issue. Even a cursory glimpse at Morton's own, rather satirical "Relation," as well as the Puritan commen- taries, striving for fatherly patience, suggests a rather different accentuation. What really seems to have provoked the Puritans' ire was less the sexual license and general carousing as such, but something much more subtly subversive. It had to do with Mor- ton's breaking down of boundaries - boundaries between mas- ter and servant, white man and red, human and beast. In fact, Morton was insolently tampering with the immutable verticality of the Great Chain of Being itself. What had to be exorcised, then, was less the uninhibited enjoyment of the body than some early attempt "Ã  faire rhizome." To move toward a kind of "hori- zontality," an equality of all living beings, turned out to be a threat not so much moral and religious as solidly social and political. By and large, the Puritans seem to have dealt with forms of desire traditionally associated with the body, more directly and honestly than many a later, supposedly more "emancipated" age. More rigid territorializations of the body, surprisingly enough, seem to have occured in the Enlightenment. There, the insistent claim for freedom from outward, religious and political repression is almost compulsively compensated by new and radi- cal forms of internalized control. This might be illustrated, for instance, in one of the American eighteenth century's most</page><page sequence="12">Spring-Summer 1987 15 worldly, relaxed, and unequivocally pleasure-oriented texts, the private diary of William Byrd. Here the seeming freedom of the body is subjugated to a tightening, ever more sharply subdividing discipline of time. Experience comes violently under the rule of Chronos; actions are right only at their appointed hours, and a text of seemingly perfect leisure turns into a scary preview of industrial, production-dominated time. The earliest intensely controversial figure is Benjamin Franklin. Critics like Melville, D.H. Lawrence, and - as Manfred Putz has ably demonstrated - also Max Weber,29 have certainly made too short shrift with him. Yet there remains little doubt that The Autobiography , backed by the immensely popular sayings in Poor Richard's Almanach , may nevertheless be read as the first major American model of ecological transgression. It is certainly the first widely read text which propagates the advantages of the social mask and, concommitantly, the reification of the body for the higher purposes of production. While Franklin relegates the "use" of "venery" to health or offspring, both again subject to the order of production, he is almost erotically excited by the idea that money may "beget" money. He thus paves the way for those manifold animistic fictions which our stock markets to this day thrive upon. To what extent these fictions may affect a reduction of the reality of the body has more recently been giddily drama- tized in William Gaddis's JR, a 700-page-powered novel achiev- ing an almost physiological, emetic effect which would have pleased Artaud. But to come back to Franklin: it was he who, perhaps most ominously, injected the notion into our brains that "time is money," reducing a communal mode of ordering experi- ence to a quantitative measure for cutting, fragmenting, buying, and selling it. And the major target for this fragmentation has become the body. Excesses of order, of course, have long been a favorite sub- ject of cultural criticism. In American literature, both Melville and Faulkner come immediately to mind. Absalom , 'Absalom! graphically depicts the sick geometry of "Sutpen's Hundred," late testimony of our promethean compulsion to hack and cut and separate our own space-time dominion out of larger living entities. The more blindly we have followed, in fact, our scientific impulse to clarify, to fence off and to seal in, the more we have come to demonize all "other," all overflow of pure unordered "historicity" (to use a term coined by Derrida),30 as threat and as potential enemy. Some of the most paranoid reactions to this</page><page sequence="13">16 Discourse 9 unchartable "other," - reactions we are only now learning to ascribe more clearly to the invention of "man" during the En- lightenment - have deeply inscribed themselves into Romanti- cism. Ahab's lance guided by his narcissistic urge to "strike through the wall," to extend, at any price, the space of ego- control, prophetically describes the phallic, imperialist quality of Western logocentrism. This lance is aimed to kill whatever resists being colonialized. But Ahab, finally strangling in the loops of his own whale line, also prefigures our century's risks of being suffo- cated by its own self-sealing, hermetic-hermeneutic systems. In postmodern literature, this impact of progressively mechanist thought (Ahab already sees himself as running "on iron rails") has been most comprehensively dramatized by Thomas Pyn- chon. His magisterial Gravity's Rainbow is, among other things, one of the great ecological novels of our time. In ever new, surprising, and profound approaches, Pynchon summarizes the costs of our technological as well as our psychic modes of creating "order." Time and again, like Moby Dick , the text confronts us with their destructive thrust. And both in Melville (as Sharon Cameron has brilliantly demonstrated in The Corporeal Self),*1 and in Pynchon (as I have tried to show elsewhere), 32 the major object of reduction is the body. At the same time, this impulse toward domination and reduction is the exact measure of our failure to sustain what Pynchon, like Burroughs and essentially already Nietzsche, associates with "the leap of Pan" - the full and frightening impact of the realities of Vernetzung. As we read in Gravity's Rainbow: This is the World just before men. Too violently pitched alive in constant flow ever to be seen by men directly. They are meant only to look at it dead, in still strata, transputre- fied to oil or coal. Alive, it was a threat: it was Titans, was an overspeaking of life so clangorous and mad, such a green corona about Earth's body that some spoiler had to be brought in before it blew the Creation apart. So we, the crippled keepers, were sent out to multiply, to have domin- ion. Cod's spoilers. Us. Counter-revolutionaries. It is our mission to promote death. The way we kill, the way we die, being unique among the Creatures. It was something we had to work on, historically and personally. To build from scratch up to its present status as reaction, nearly as strong as life, holding down the green uprising. But only nearly as strong. Pynchon evidently shares Jantsch's belief in the self-healing po-</page><page sequence="14">Spring-Summer 1987 17 tential of nature (a belief which also informs Ernest Callenbach's well-intentioned but poorly written Ecotopia). Like Jantsch, Pyn- chon envisions the process of reorganization in the image of a "green uprising," implying violent breaches of symmetry that will cause sharp, if temporary, increases in entropy. But the tenor of Jantch's Die Selbstorganisation des Universums is still the evolution- ary optimism of the seventies, based on a strange admixture of right reason, flower power, and the instrumentalism of high technology. Viewed from the residual anthropomorphism of Jantsch, Pynchon presents a grimmer view. For him, the next level of autopoeisis, or creative "overspeaking of life," may well be a world that has abolished its "crippled keepers," a world without man. I end this haphazard survey by pointing to a particularly ambitious account of the costs of order enacted as territorializa- tion of the body. I am referring to Coover's long short story "The Baby-Sitter." In this story, the process of proliferation of control evidently has reached the text itself, the text as a kind of "double" of the body. The way the story is told encourages us to envision a narrator who constitutes a somewhat sinister mÃ©lange of Peeping Tom and minor league totalitarian. In a manner reminiscent of the director and/or observer of a multi-channel television set, he performs a series of "switchings" or violent displacements, by beginning the story again and again from slightly shifting spatial or temporal positions. By these irritating "slippages," he demon- strates his sovereign power over the body of the text which is then "doubled" by the recurrent motif of physical power turned against the exposed body of another in the text. This double dimension of violence can be seen even more clearly in "The Magic Poker," where narration is quite openly enacted as a form of sadism and rape: "I arrange the guest cabin. I rot the porch and tatter the screen door and infest the walls. I tear out the light switches, gut the mattresses, smash the windows, and shit on the bathroom floor. I rust the pipes, kick in the papered walls, un- hinge doors. Really, there's nothing to it. In fact, it's a pleasure."34 Here, Coover demonstrates with gusto that all narration is an act of violence, of conscious or unconscious transgression. This in- sight, of course, lays itself wide open to the charge of banality. Following its logic, we will end up by equalizing violence with action and reduce it to meaninglessness. Coover's assertion makes sense only within certain contexts having to do with the definition of art. It seems to be aimed essentially against the high claims of romanticism and modernism - art as an autonomous act of creation, dedicated to the production of the most sublime</page><page sequence="15">18 Discourse 9 forms of order and meaning, hence an act of the highest social virtue. In undercutting these assumptions, Coover also willfully forgoes all consistency of plot, exposing the naked proppings of the art in an almost kamikaze exercise of "self-reflectivity." At the same time, this procedure amounts to a further decentering, denying identity to a privileged story by evoking the final equi- validity of all stories. But "The Baby-Sitter" also manages to convey some of the costs of this imperialist creation of order. Most obviously, the mode of narration submerges the narrated figures in an aquar- ium-like medium of isolation. It proves impervious to all human touch, unless the latter be enacted in forms of violence and aggression. But even aggression never quite reaches its object. It only touches mediated forms, figures fragmented by the flicker- ing light of the omnipresent television, mere replicas of the living body. At the same time it becomes progressively unclear who is performing and who is suf fering this cutting-off - whether it is not the narrator rather than his figures who is imprisoning him- self in this deadly isolation. But what is the major pay-off in exempting the body of the text from the living feedback of Vernetzung? It appears similar to that hoped for by St. John in sacrificing the world's body - to achieve exemption from time. But here, the repressed returns with a vengeance. For more and more, as Coover's brilliantly conducted narrative unfolds, the violence of the narrator against the text metamorphoses into a violence of the text against the narrator. This violence emerges primarily as a kind of counter- terror of narrative conventions, while at the same time remind- ing us of the immutable directedness of the arrow of time. For as the narrative progresses, the more hectically the narrator at- tempts to switch, to displace the individual scenes, the more the narrated begins to offer resistance. It appears that the multiple beginnings of narration cannot be indefinitely moved before the exposition, or the climax is by-passed by the denouement. The major resistance, however, is offered by the "real" time of narration, which is marked, in another ironic twist, by the actual TV program time. This time progresses hour by hour, no matter how clever the tricks of the narrator. The fact but under- lines an insight formulated by William Spanos, that even the most deconstructed story will still be narrated "from its end.":*r&gt; Be- yond a certain point of no return - this is the impression Coover skillfully conveys - the text actually begins "to write itself," even against the narrator's manifest intentions. The final pages of</page><page sequence="16">Spring-Summer 1987 19 "The Babysitter" powerfully affirm this, as scenes imperiously begin to claim their endings, actors tire, stories start to interfuse and randomize, and the frantic switchings of the narrator are finally flooded by a dam-bursting rush of denouements. Thus, in a final paradox which relates closely to the riddle of Vernetzung , the acknowledgement of death as a way of breaking control, of narrative "composting," opens the text to new forms of life. But where, at this point, do we stand with our "cost-efficien- cy" account of culture? Many of our most valued literary texts seem to center, somehow, on situations where the "costs" have become excessive. But does what we may have learned from such texts really translate into the next terminology of crisis? Will we then know how to "do better" when both history and "Mother Nature" so staunchly deny us any clues as to what might be ultimately contextually "right" or "wrong" for our or any other system? when we are hardly sure any more what, apart from our own demarcations, constitutes a "system"? when even the most well-meaning and disinterested step toward more ecological bal- ance and symbiosis might turn out to be a symmetry rupture of appalling violence, given the very real resistances built into exist- ing structures? And yet, if we do not try to take exactly that step, at the same time relearning to acknowledge whatever it is we so desperately hide behind our myths of power and control, we may soon be extinct as a species. But at this point, one further question must be raised. Who, actually, is this "we" who today so vociferously arrogates to itself the world's salvation? Renate Hof rightly questions the authority of the ecological "speaking subject" which is now claiming a general biocentric egalitarianism. This "autonomous" subject is easily identified as predominantly white, middle class, and male. The "we" refers to a rather privileged group, many members of which might be more worried about the shrubs in their suburban yards or the wildlife parks they feel they need for their leisure than about any real equality. A remarkably high percentage of this group, for instance - so articulately concerned about the population explosion and the "carrying capacity" of the planet - is strongly opposed to abortion, presumably on moral grounds. As a member of such a group, my very protest entangles me in contradictions. But these contradictions are hardly on the same level with that demanding, f rightening paradox which may face us after the last hope for still discovering some viable ecological parameters has broken down. I am addressing that still point</page><page sequence="17">20 Discourse 9 where, referred back to the riddle of infinite Vernetzung , the ecological may finally turn into an hermeneutic-against-itself. "You have no chance," Herbert Achternbusch succinctly puts this point in his film Die Atlantikschwimmer ; "but use it."^7 Notes 1 Wolfgang Iser, "Die Wirklichkeit der Fiktion: Elemente eines funktionsgeschictlichen Textmodells," in RezeptionsÃ¤sthetik , ed.

It is also touched upon by Jantsch, and further discussed in various issues of Horst Stern's journal Natur. 12 Alfred Korzybski's influential argument is further explored in the chapter "Form, Substance, Difference" in Gregory Bateson's impor- tant Steps Toward an Ecology of Mind (New York: Ballantine, 1972).

Iser tried to locate literature in a space of particularly heightened instability. I(i Ulrich Horstmann, Das Untier: Konturen einer Philosophie der Mens- chenÃucht (Wien and Berlin: Medusa, 1983). 17 Jantsch is aware that every large-scale evolutionary reorganiza- tion of biological or social structures has, historically, been preceded by a sharp rise in energy consumption, or entropy. I do not, however, share Jantsch's optimism - still unshaken in the late seventies - that such re- organization, on a human scale, can continue to count on a large-scale "export" of entropy. Much less can it count on an export of the concom- mitant increase in poisonous wastes. From this point of view, Jantsch's evolutionary zest as well as his attempt to by-pass the second law of thermodynamics will, I believe, soon need revisioning. 18 On the attention payed by ecologists to "climax states," and the hope for clues to a permanent balance of social systems implied in it, see Donald Worster, Nature's Economy: The Roots oj Ecology (Garden City, NY : Anchor Books, 1979). George Sessions, in his helpful survey of ecologi- cal ideas, comes to similarly sceptical conclusions - see "Shallow and Deep Ecology: A Review of the Philosophical Literature," in Ecological Consciousness, ed.

See Selbstor- ganisation, 1 73 et passim. Jantsch ends by pointing to Hans Jonas's sugges- tive idea that God is evolution, perpetually risking, abandoning, and re- creating himself - see Selbstorganisation , 412. 20 Recently, the term "environment" itself has come under attack because it still seems to carry the implication that we can place ourselves "beyond" such an environment.
