The account of man's creation in Gen. 1,26f deals with the creation of the inner non-material man in the image of God, whereas Gen. 2,7 deals with the creation of the human body, the outer man, which is not created in the image of God. Some later critics claim that according to Origen Gen. 2,7 is about the creation of a non-material luminous body. In Origen's opinion only the inner man can reach perfection. The outer man can never be perfect, but will be destroyed. To deepen our understanding of, how Origen understands the mortality of the human body, some short sayings about the meaning of Gen. 3,21 are interpreted. In the few places where Origen refers explicitly to Gen. 3,21 there is no clear picture of how he interprets this verse. The most precise observation we can make is that in his view the skin coats denote the mortal corporality that surrounds the inner man. Keywords Origen, anthropology, Genesis 1-3, human body, inner man, outer man, image of God Introduction Origen grounds many of his anthropological statements in the biblical creation thought. A literal interpretation of the accounts of the Creation and Fall in Gen. 1-3 is unacceptable to both reason and piety. However, if these accounts are interpreted allegorically, they are in Origen's view pre cise testimonies to the creation of man and the cosmos. An examination of Origen's interpretation of these first three chapters of Genesis is therefore an important prerequisite for understanding his anthropology. ?

Jacobsen / Vigiliae Christianae 62 (2008) 213-232 At the outset, however, there is a major practical problem: We know that Origen wrote a very detailed commentary on the first chapters of Genesis that is lost. His understanding and exposition must therefore be gathered from many other sources, whose reliability must be evaluated if we are to create order and coherence in the fragmentary material. Even if this proves successful, we can never acquire as comprehensive a picture of Origen's interpretation of Gen. 1-3 as the commentary itself would give. These then are the premises on which we must work: they must spur us towards the greatest possible precision when studying the texts and towards caution on any conclusions we may reach-for in the circumstances these can never be regarded as final. To focus the evaluation of Origen's Genesis-exegesis for his anthropol ogy I have chosen to concentrate on his interpretation of Gen. 1,26-27; 2,7 and 3,21 Ihe Relation between Gen. 1,26-27; 2,7 and 3,21 Origen often compares Gen. 1,26f with Gen. 2,7. According to him, these are two accounts of the same event, yet simultaneously accounts of two stages in the Creation process. This is how they are presented for instance in Hom. Jer. 1,10,1 where Origen points out that in Gen. 1,26 (LXX) we find noI?tEo (make, create), whereas in Gen. 2,7 (LXX) nXc6ico (form) is used.2 flot?Co is applied to the creation of non-material man in the image of God, whereas ntXiocyw is used about the creation of man's material form from earth. This is why, according to Origen, Jer. 1,5 uses nTX6ciyo and not notEoi, since the non-material, inner man, who is created, does not come into being in the womb. That, on the other hand, is precisely the case with material man, who is formed. We thus have a clear definition of the difference between Gen. 1,26f and Gen. 2,7. It is important to note that in this interpretation Gen. 2,7 refers to the creation of the concrete, mate rial body, not to the formation of a spiritual corporality or suchlike. This understanding of the relation between Gen. 1,26f and Gen. 2,7 is charac teristic of Origen,3 and can be regarded as one of the most important hermeneutic keys to his interpretation of the Creation accounts. 1} Homiliae in Ieremiam, Or?genes Werke, Vol. 31 GCS, ed.

In his commentary on Genesis Procopius of Gaza4 makes the following comment on Gen. 3,21: But those who allegorise say after this ridicule that the man in the image denotes the soul, and the man from the earth denotes the body of fine particles, which is worthy of life in Paradise, and which some have called luminous. The skin coats denote, as Job says: You have clothed me with skin andflesh, You have woven me of bones and sinews [Job 10,1 1 ]. They say that the soul first uses the luminous [body] as a vehicle, and later dons the skin coats.5 Procopius says that such teachers are contradicting the teaching of the Church. He then appends a list of theologians of the early Church who in his view oppose these allegorists' interpretation of the first chapters of Genesis; among them is Theophilus, bishop of Alexandria.6 In an epistle to the church in Constantinople Theophilus rejects Origen's allegorical inter pretation, which suggests that Origen might actually be one of the allego risers whom Procopius names. However, we cannot be certain that Procopius is referring directly to Origen. He may well have been referring to the Origenists'7 in general. If the reference is to Origen himself, it is equally uncertain whether or not Procopius is reproducing Origen's view faithfully. The source for Origen is therefore unsafe here, though there is some probability that it contains important material to illuminate his interpretation of Genesis. 4) Procopius of Gaza, who lived from 465 CE to shortly after 530, was the first to write a major catena to the Octateuch, where in particular he compiled statements from Origen's commentaries.

Jacobsen / Vigiliae Christianae 62 (2008) 213-232 The Procopius text provides a somewhat different picture of the struc ture in the interpretation of the Genesis account than is characteristic of Origen's own texts. In similar fashion Gen. 1,26f describes the creation of the inner man, but according to Procopius' allegorisers, Gen. 2,7 does not describe the creation of man's material body, but rather the creation of a finer, more radiant body that is more suited to life in Paradise, in other words, the bodies that Adam and Eve had in Paradise. According to Proco pius, the material body comes into being only as a result of the Fall, a process described in Gen. 3,21 where God subsequently clothes Adam and Eve in skins. If this idea can be attributed to Origen himself, it has impor tant consequences for our understanding of his interpretation of the Crea tion account, since this view of corporality is different and more complex than immediately appears from the preserved texts of Origen. Origen's Exegesis of Gen. 1,26f and 2,7: Creation of the Inner and the Outer Man C. Cels. 6,63 contains in a condensed but relatively clear form some of the most important perspectives in Origen's interpretation of Gen. 1,26f and Gen. 2,7. Ihe text is transmitted in Greek and is therefore a good starting point for our examination. The section in question constitutes part of a lengthy discussion of Celsus's criticism of the Creation accounts. For instance, Celsus attacks the idea that from Gen. 1,26f one can conclude that man is created in God's image: God is not like man, God has no form, says Celsus.8 His protest is against the anthropomorphic image of God.9 According to Origen, the charge against Celsus is that he shares a broad misconception of God's image in man, with the topsy-turvy result that man thereby creates God in his own image. This is also true of many Chris tians, the so-called simpliciores,'0 from whom Origen distances himself time and again. So what does he do to put a stop to this misunderstanding? 8) C. Cels. 6,63, Or?genes Werke, Vol. 2, GCS, ed. P. Koetschau, 1899, 133,16-17. 9) On Origen's criticism of the anthropomorphic image of God and polemic against those who claim such a concept of God see G. H?llstr?m, Fides Simpliciorum according to Origen of Alexandria, Ekn?s 1984, 64-69. 10) On these simpliciores see G. H?llstr?m 1984, who examines Origen's description of these "simple" Christians who at least quantatively constituted a distinctive factor in contemporary Christianity. According to H?llstr?m these simpliciores are not Christians without theology but Christians without a speculative and philosophical stamp to their theology, building instead on a literal reading of the Bible.</page><page sequence="5">Genesis 1-3 as Source for Origen 217 Firstly he points out that Celsus is in error in failing to distinguish between what is in God's image,11 and what is God's image.12 God's image is the firstborn of all creation, the Logos Himself, Truth itself and Wisdom itself."3 Man on the other hand is created in God's image.'4 This is Origen's first precaution against anthropomorphising God's image. Since man is not God's image, but is only in or according to God's image, there is an instance between God and man that prevents us from concluding too swiftly from man to God. This idea of the Logos as God's image and as an intermediary between God and man has a number of consequences with regard to the theology of Creation, to anthropology and to christology, and is a subject to which we shall return. Tfhe essential point here is Origen's rebuttal of Celsus' criticism of the anthropomorphising of the concept of God. As his second argument against Celsus' criticism of the idea that God's image in man attributes anthropomorphic features to God, Origen asserts that Celsus has failed to understand which part of man God's image relates to. God's image does not relate to man's body, as Celsus believes, but to his soul, which either has not been defined, or is no longer defined, by man and his deeds before the Fall.'5 According to Origen it is inconceivable that God's image should have its seat in the corruptible body, which is the low est part of the composite man. This would mean that the highest part of man, the soul, would not be in the image of God. Two possibilities remain: Either God's image can be in both the body and the soul, or it can be in the soul alone. The first of these is again rejected by Origen, since it would mean that God, in whose image (FiKdV) man is created, must also then be composed of body and soul. The only remaining possibility is that God's image relates to the soul, or the inner man,'6 as Origen also calls it. This distinction between soul and body is, as we shall see, absolutely fundamen tal to Origen's understanding of man and of man's creation and salvation.

Jacobsen / Vigiliae Christianae 62 (2008) 213-232 parts of his being can be saved, because not all of them have the same rela tion to the Creator and the saviour. Only the part of man that is created in God's image can be saved. The idea of God's image in man plays a role in the creation of man but also in his salvation and perfection, according to Origen. This finds par ticular expression in the last part of C. Cels. 6,63, where in connection with the localising of God's image in the inner man we find this inner man defined as that which can be renewed andformed in the Creators image. We are dealing here with man's endeavour to perfection. It is God's image in the soul that has the strength to strive for perfection and sanctity, and the soul that can follow God and assume God's characteristics to itself. It is clear that man's soul must move towards a perfect condition, the point being that it is the soul that is created in God's image and can achieve this perfec tion-not the body. In C. Cels. 6,63 there are thus three major themes connected with man's creation in God's image: 1) The idea that the Logos is God's image, whereas man, or rather, rational beings, are copies of God's image. 2) The idea that man is dichotomous and consists of both soul and body, of which only the soul is in God's image. 3) Finally the idea that God's image is the perfected state to which the soul is striving. In the following I shall only examine how the second of these themes is developed in Origen's exposition of Genesis. It transpires from the above analysis of C Cels. 6,63 that one of Origen's main points in his interpretation of Gen. 1,26f is that it is man's soul that is created in God's image and not man's body. If we are to judge by how often and how markedly he makes this point, we are dealing here with the most central theme in his interpretation of Gen. 1 ,26f. In Dial. Her. 10,16-24,17 Origen treats the subject of God's image in man in connection with his response to Bishop Dionysius' question: "Is the soul the blood?" 17 According to Origen it is a misunderstanding to identify the soul with the material blood-and a misunderstanding that would mean that the soul perishes together with the material body.18 Ori gen's solution, which he derives from his study of scripture is that incorpo real phenomena such as the soul are given the same names as corporeal phenomena. Specifically therefore, the designations refer to corporeal phe nomena, but figuratively they refer to the inner-incorporeal-part of man. Origen develops this argument by applying it to practically every 17) Dial. Her. 10,16. The question arises from the Septuagint version of Lk. 17,11. 18) Cf. Dial. Her. 10,17-21.</page><page sequence="7">Genesis 1-3 as Source for Origen 219 part of the body in Dial. Her. 16,17-22,12.19 However, in our context it is not these concrete examples that are interesting, but rather the underlying viewpoint, which is as follows: Scripture says that man consists of two people.20 This assertion is defended first with a reference to Paul's speech on the outer and the inner man in 2. Cor. 4,16.21 According to Origen, however, Paul is not the first to see this, but Moses. This is clear from Gen. 1 ,26f and Gen. 2,7. For Gen. 2,7 is not, as some believe,22 a repetition of Gen. 1,26f, but there are two accounts representing different stages in the process of the Creation: Gen. 1 ,26f describes the creation of immaterial man in God's image, while Gen. 2,7 describes the creation of material man from earth. Origen's conclusion to this account is as follows: The first-made man was thus the one who was created in the image. In this man there was nothing material. For the man who is created in the image is not of the material. And God said: Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over etc. and God created man not by taking dust from the earth as in the second time but in God's image He created him.23 19) Cf. C. Cels. 7,34; De princ. 1,1,9; Horn. Ex. 10,3. 20) "A?o ?vOpcoTtoD? x\ ypacprj ??yei e?va? x?v avOpomov" (Dial. Her. 11,19-20). 21) As can be seen here, Origen finds the biblical justification that man comprises two peo ple, an inner and an outer one in 2. Cor. 4,16, where Paul distinguishes precisely between the outer man (? ?'cjco tju?ov avOpomoc) and the inner man (? earn t||jx?v [avOpcorco?]). Due to this distinction the verse is one of Origen's anthropological core texts. The same is true to a certain extent of Rom. 7,22f, where eGCO ocvGpcoTto? also appears, though not in con trast to ??co avOpooTCO?, but to \ieXr\ uou. Origen's understanding of eGCO avOpcoTto? is prob ably also marked by the Platonic tradition's use of the concept, e.g. in Plato, Republic IX, 589A; Plotinus, Enneade V,I,10.

Jacobsen / Vigiliae Christianae 62 (2008) 213-232 It is established here that the Creation act related in Gen. 1,26f, is the creation of the non-material man. It is this man that in the context of the quotation Origen calls the inner man.24 And it is this inner man that is in God's image and not the outer man created from earth (cf. Gen. 2,7).25 So Origen reads Gen. 1,26f in combination with Gen. 2,7 to define what man is: a being with two aspects, an inner and an outer man. It is thus clear that on the basis of his exegesis of the Creation account Origen sets down certain fundamental anthropological definitions. Already here we can sense that his distinction between the inner and the outer, between the corporeal and the incorporeal is value-laden, and this is confirmed by other texts. In Hom. Gen. 1,13 Origen explains what God's image in man consists of by first distancing himself from an apparently widespread misconcep tion, and then by asserting its true content. The misconception is that man in God's image is a corporeal being. Both the reservation and the terminol ogy in which it is expressed we have met before. Origen is again playing on the difference that he finds between notot) (facere), as used in Gen. 1,26, and nXkacoco (plasmare), as used in Gen. 2,7.26 The formed, material body cannot contain God's image. Only the created, i.e. incorporeal, man can do that.27 We saw above that Origen emphasises among other things the asomatic condition of man in God's image in an attempt to avoid the idea that God's image in man leads to the attribution to Him of anthropomor phic features. It is also his only justification in this context for man in God's image being incorporeal.28 Of more interest, however, is the positive content that Origen defines as being linked to God's image in man: But what is created in God's image is our inner man, which is invisible, incorpo real, incorruptible and immortal. In such [qualities] God's image must be truly apprehended.29 24) Ci Dial. Her. 11,16-23. 25) See also e.g. C Cels. 7,66. Cf. H. Rahner, 1947, 211. 26) Cf. Hom.

In his enim talibus Dei imago rectius intelligitur" (Hom. Gen. 1,13, Or?genes Werke Vol. 6, 15,11-14).</page><page sequence="9">Genesis 1-3 as Sourcefor Origen 221 First he asserts again that man in God's image is asomatic-to which the predicate invisible corresponds. The two other characteristics that Origen links to the image-incorruptibility and immortality-point to the escha tological perspectives in the idea of God's image in man: The inner man is not stricken down with death and annihilation as the body-man's outer form is. It is unthinkable for Origen that the divine should be annihilated; since it is everlasting. God will not allow that which He has created in His image to perish.30 Here we see how in the context of the doctrine of Creation and of anthropology certain premises are laid down that are of great significance for eschatology. While there is little doubt that with the definitions of immortal ity and incorruptibility Origen is pointing towards the eschatological con summation, it is less certain what these characteristics mean for man's origin. Origen's repeated emphasis that the consummation is identical with the beginning, which also finds expression in Hom. Gen. 1,13, must force us to consider to what extent incorruptibility and immortality, which can be com bined in the concept of eternity, also play a role in connection with protology. This question can only be answered, however, by including other texts in a more systematic description of the inner man created in God's image. In Com. Rom. 7,4 Origen also makes the same distinction as in Gen. 1,26f and Gen. 2,7 between the inner and the outer man, and in this context he adds a number of definitions of the inner man. He is expounding Rom. 8, 18-22 and therefore examining what kind of incorruptibility it is that the Creation is subject to (cf. Rom. 8,20), with the following result: It seems to me that this is said of the material and corruptible corporeal substance. For corruptibility applies only to the body. For the inner man, who is created in accordance with God, i.e. created in His image, is incorruptible and invisible and in accordance with his own kind is called incorporeal. The outer man on the other hand is called corporeal and corruptible.31 According to Origen, the corruptibility that Rom. 8,20 refers to is actual corporality. It is not corporality that is subject to corruptibility; corporality 30) Ci e.g.. Hom. Jer. 16,6. 31) "Mihi videtur, quod de hac mat?riau et corruptibili corporis substantia ista dicantur. Neque enim corruptio alii cuiquam nisi corpori dominatur. Nam ille interior homo, qui secundum Deum creams est et ad imaginem Dei factus, incorruptibilis est et invisibilis et secundum propriam sui rationem etiam incorporeus dici potest. Exterior vero homo et corporeus et corruptibilis dicitur,..." (Com. Rom. 7,4, ed. vonT. Heiter, Fontes Christiani, Herder, Freiburg 1990-1996, Vol. 2/4, 50,17-24).</page><page sequence="10">222 A. L. Jacobsen / Vigiliae Christianae 62 (2008) 213-232 is itself corruptibility. It is thus a radical understanding of the relation between the outer and the inner man that Origen is asserting here. The inner man, however, is created in accordance with God, created in His image. This inner man is further defined as incorruptible, invisible and incorpo real, appellations that we have previously seen.?2 The new element in this text is that the inner man is radically contrasted with the outer man. As so often, Origen draws his distinction between the inner and the outer man from Paul in 2. Cor. 4,16, whom he quotes, both in support of his thesis and as a continuation of his theme, where he concentrates on describing the renewal of the inner man. For Rom. 8,20f speaks not only of the sub jection of creation to corruptibility but also of the hope of deliverance. According to Origen therefore, there is close agreement between Rom. 8,20f and 2. Cor. 4,16. For the destruction of the outer man leads precisely to the deliverance of the inner man. Origen is therefore able to summarise concisely the significance of man's deliverance as follows: The hope is that of being delivered from this corporeal and corruptible state.33 This text brings no specifically new information about the nature of the inner man. As can be seen from the above, this man is described as incor poreal, incorruptible and invisible. What is clearer, however, is how radi cally Origen understands this incorporality and incorruptibility. In his view there is absolutely nothing corporeal or corruptible in the nature of the inner man. It is also clear what this means in an eschatological perspec tive: Renewal, deliverance and consummation involve a radical separation of everything corporeal and corruptible.34 At this stage we can thus conclude that Origen's exegesis of Gen. 1,26 27 and 2,7 is focused on the definition of the inner and the outer man. The inner man is created in the image of God, which is Logos. Therefore he is incorporeal and spiritual. It is also the inner man who will be saved in the end. The outer man is the man of flesh and blood. The man of flesh and 32) Cf. esp. Hom. Gen. 1,13. 33) "Spes namque est ab his rebus corporeis et corruptibilibus aliquando cessandum" (Com. Rom. 7,4, Fontes Christiani, Vol. 2/4, 56,20-21). 34) On Origen's distinction between the inner and the outer man, see also Com. Cant., prolo gus, Or?genes Werke Vol. 8, GCS, ed. von. WA.

When Origen thus connects the creation of the outer man in Gen. 2,7 with the Fall of man we have to take a look at his exegesis of story of the Fall of Man in Gen. 3 to see how it relates to his exegesis of Gen. 2,7. For that purpose the best will be to focus on Gen. 3,21 where it is told, how God equips Eve and Adam with skin coats. Origen's Interpretation of Gen. 3,21 The above examination of Origen's interpretation of Gen. 1 ,26f and Gen. 2,7 has shown that according to him these two texts deal with the creation of the inner and the outer man respectively. As we saw in the introduction, Origen's critics later claimed that he distinguished between two forms of corporality, so that Gen. 2,7 was said to deal with the creation of a form of spiritual corporality, while Gen. 3,21 was said to describe the coming into being of material corporality. This is an interesting claim, since Origen speaks of different forms of corporality in his description of the resurrected body. However, our examination of Origen's exegesis of Gen. 2,7 already questions this claim; for we have seen that Origen consistently maintained that Gen. 2,7 describes the creation of the material and corruptible corpo rality without defining this corporality as a special spiritual corporality. To provide further clarity on this point I shall turn to his interpretation of Gen. 3,21, where God equips Eve and Adam with skin coats after they have been banished from the Garden. According to Biblia Patristica35 Origen annotates Gen. 3,21 only five times,36 and the interpretation of Gen. 3,21 is the main purpose in only one of these pericopes. This makes it even more difficult to say anything for certain about how Origen would have read the text if it was a question of an actual commentary on the verse. The one passage that may be said to have the character of an actual commentary on Gen. 3,21 has been trans mitted by Theodoret.37 In this paragraph he sets Theodore of Mopsuestia's view of what the skin coats in Gen. 3,21 denote against Origen's.

Jacobsen / Vigiliae Christianae 62 (2008) 213-232 regards both views as unacceptable. However, it is only Origen's interpreta tion that is of interest in this context. According to Theodoret, Origen first distances himself from the literal interpretation: God does not sew clothes for Adam and Eve. In order to avoid the literal interpretation one could assume that the skin coats denote the bodies. Origen finds this convincing, but lacking proof In particular it is a problem that in Gen. 2,23 Adam says of Eve: This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh etc. This sug gests that the earthly bodies were present before God clothed Adam and Eve in the skin coats. To avoid this difficulty one could assume, as some have done according to Origen, that the skin coats denote the mortality to which Adam and Eve had been subjected as a result of their sin. But in Origen's view this creates even more difficulties: Firstly, it was God who gave the skin coats but it was sin that was the cause of mortality. Secondly, such an interpretation would mean that the earthly body of nature is immor tal, since death was not added until after the body's creation. Thirdly, proof would be needed that man required all his limbs in Paradise. Origen does not believe this to be the case. At this point Theodoret's quotation ends. In my view not much can be said for certain about Origen's interpretation of Gen. 3,21 on the basis of this short fragment. It must be allowed, however, that Origen apparently leans to the view that the skin coats in Gen. 3,21 denote corporality. But first and foremost it is clear that under all circum stances Origen believes that the verse must be interpreted allegorically.38 This is also the most important point that can be concluded from Origen's statement on the question in C. Cels. 4,40. Here he says that the skin coats have a secret, mystical significance that surpasses Plato's doctrine of the fall of the soul. He thus suggests at the very least that the skin coats have some thing to do with the fall of the soul leading to its being clothed in a body. Moreover the skin coats were given to those who had sinned, suggesting that the two interpretations which according to the Theodoret fragment Origen had contrasted with one another were not incompatible: the skin coats are the mortal bodies that are given by God as a result of man's sin. This linking of sin, mortality and material corporality is also found in many other passages in Origen, including, as we saw, the interpretation of 38) On the interpretation of this passage see H.-J. Vogt, 'Warum wurde Origen zum H?retiker erkl?rt?,' Origeniana Quarta, ed. L. Lies, Tyrolia-Verlag, Innsbruck/Vienna 1987, 86-87 and 100-101. Vogt argues both for the authenticity of the text and that Origen agreed with the interpretation of the skin coats as denoting the bodies.</page><page sequence="13">Genesis 1-3 as Sourcefor Origen 225 Gen. 2,7. In Hom. Reg. 1,6 Origen presents one of his typical exegetical associations in commenting on Ex. 3,5, where God commands Moses to take off his sandals because he is standing on holy ground. Origen calls these sandals calciamenta depellibus mortuis.39 This defining of the sandals as being of mortal skin must without doubt be understood as an allusion to Gen. 3,21. The sandals denote the same as the cloaks of skin. That they are of mortal skin symbolises the mortality that surrounded Moses as he left Egypt, but which he was released from when he began to go forth in power and climb up to God's mountain, where he became keeper of the immortal mysteries.40 It is clear that the sandals of mortal skin refer to mortality. But the very fact that they denote the mortality by which Moses was surrounded (constrictus) suggests to me that it is more precise to say that the sandals denote the mortal body. Moses is released from this mortal corporality by his ascension of God's mountain, whereby he becomes administrator of the immortal mysteries. Of course this is a reference to the ascension of Sinai, where Moses is given the tablets of the Law and the directives for the fur nishing of the tabernacle.41 The mountain thus becomes a symbol of the state in which one can exist without a mortal body. It is made even clearer if we imagine that when he wrote this passage Origen also had at the back of his mind the transfiguration on the mountain (cf. Mt. 17,1-13). For Moses is standing on top of the mountain in a transfigured and radiant form-a form that has discarded all signs of mortality. Thus on this inter pretation the leather sandals, which correspond in meaning to the leather cloaks in Gen. 3,21, denote the material, mortal corporality with which the inner man is clothed, while he lives "here below", and from which he can be released through the ascent or process of education that is the core of Origen's theological system. 39) Cf. Hom. Reg. 1,6, Or?genes WerkeVol 8, 10,29, GCS, ed. WA. Baehrens, 1925. 40) The above is a summary of the following passage: "..., sicut dicitur ad Moysen: solve corrigiam calciamenti tui; locus enim, in quo tu stas, terra sancta est [Ex. 3,5]. Et quid puta mus quod in his non aliquid mysterii obtectum sit, sed, quia Deus exsecrabatur calciamenta Moysi corporalia, ideo haec iubeat? Aut illud magis putandum est quod, cum exiret de terra Aegypti, habebat calciamenta de pellibus mortuis et erat velut quadam mortalitate constrictus, cum vero coepit proficere ad virtutem et adscendere montem Dei atque ibi immortalibus ministrare mysteriis, tune dicitur ad eum, ut indicia mortalitatis abiceret, quae in calcia mentis peliciis designantur" (Hom. Reg. 1,6, Or?genes Werke Vol. 8, 10,24-11,4). 41) Cf. Ex. 19-31. In Greek early Church theology there are several examples of Moses' ascent of Sinai being regarded as a model for man's ascent to God, cf. e.g. Gregory of Nyssa, De Vita Moysis.</page><page sequence="14">226 A. L. Jacobsen / Vigiliae Christianae 62 (2008) 213-232 In Hom. Lv. 6,2 Origen examines some of the precepts for the Levitical priesthood, including the precepts for Aaron's clothing.42 In this context he compares Aaron's clothes, which are the clothes of faith (fidelibus) and piety (sanctis), with the clothes that God gave Adam and Eve after their sin. These are the clothes of unhappiness (infelicia).43 And they are skin coats. These ... symbolised the mortality that he had received for the sake of sin and his frailty, which came as the result of the corruption of the flesh.44 The skin coats clearly symbolise mortality. It is less clear whether they denote at the same time the origin of material corporality, or whether this corporality was already present before Adam and Eve's sin but because of their sin was subjected to mortality and frailty. The latter seems to me the more probable interpretation of the brief statement. It does not agree, however, with those passages in which Origen says that Gen. 2,7 deals with the creation of the corruptible body. Nor does such an interpretation take into account the misgivings he expressed in the Theodoret-fragment, where he speaks of a material corporality that was originally immortal. The question is whether one can or should expect systematic precision of such a brief passing remark as the present one. Finally, there is perhaps a statement in Hom. Jer. 18 945 that can throw light on Origen's interpretation of Gen. 3,21. This is not a quotation from Gen. 3,21 or a direct reference to that verse. On the contrary, Origen inserts the statement as one of the promises of the prophets concerning the nearness of God, though the statement cannot be identified in the canonical writings. It is probably a quotation from an apocryphal book of Ezekiel:46 I will be closer to them than their cloaks of flesh.47 42) Horn. Lv. 6,2, Or?genes Werke Vol. 6, GCS, Vol. 29, ed. WA.

The deviant wording is because he is quoting from elsewhere. Whether Origen is referring to Gen. 3,21 in a specific context or the allusion is the sole work of the author of the apoc ryphal book of Ezekiel is hard to determine. Nevertheless, Origen is clearly using the quotation to support his view that the material body is regarded as a cloak that surrounds the real man. Tfhe understanding of corporality in this quotation is thus the same as that which is most often expressed in connection with Gen. 2,7. Despite their divergences and limited scope these texts give a clear pic ture of what is important for Origen in the interpretation of Gen. 3,21, namely that the skin coats denote the corruptible corporality that is the result of sin. In this conclusion lies the view that it is inexpedient to sepa rate mortality and material corporality by saying that according to Origen the skin coats in Gen. 3,21 either denote mortality as a consequence of sin or material corporality. The distinction is doubtless due to the Gnostic inter pretation of Gen. 3,21, and to the possibility that Origen himself may have hinted at it, cf the Theodoret fragment in particular. It is typical of Origen, however, that he links mortality and material corporality,48 though in the texts analysed above it is unclear how the form of material, mortal corporality in Gen. 3,21 relates to the corporality in Gen. 2,7. These statements therefore bring us no clarification of the relation between Gen. 2,7 and 3,21. Along with these views from Origen's own texts on the meaning of Gen. 3,21 are some statements made by the participants in the Controversy over Origen in which it was claimed that according to Origen the skin coats in Gen. 3,21 denote the body or corporality. In Methodius's work De resurrectione Aglaophon, who can be regarded as a representative of Origen's views,49 claims that the clothes which God made to clothe Adam and Eve after their sin are their bodies.50 Similarly, Epiphanius of Salamis states that Origen taught that the skin coats were "the body's flesh or the body itself".51 In Panarion52 and in his epistle to the Origen-orientated Bishop John of 48) Seee.g.Deprinc. 1,7,5; 2,10,1. 49) Thus HJ.

Jacobsen / Vigiliae Christianae 62 (2008) 213-232 Jerusalem53 Epiphanius repeatedly presents the same charge against Ori gen. Jerome too believes that Origen claimed that the skin coats in Gen. 3,21 denote the human body. Like the other two Jerome thinks that this is a heretical assumption.54 Thus a number of early Church theologians testify unanimously that Origen understood the skin coats in Gen. 3,21 to denote the human body. It is difficult to determine on this basis what Origen himself believed. We cannot ignore the fact that the clearest and most schematic presenta tion of the relation between Gen. 2,7 and Gen. 3,21 -according to which Gen. 2,7 denotes the origin of a spiritual body and Gen. 3,21 the origin of the material body-appears in one of the critics' summaries of Origen's teaching but not in his own writings. It is equally difficult to ignore the fact that Origen's critics present his interpretation of Gen. 3,21 more unambiguously than he himself does. The critics' description is perhaps an expression of a systematisation which either they themselves attribute to Origen or which they find in the Origenists of posterity. In Origen's own writings the image is not so unequivocal. Both Gen. 2,7 and Gen. 3,21 can be read as a description of the origin of the material body. On the basis of the above analysis, all that we can say about the structure in Origen's inter pretation of Gen. 1-3 is that with his background in an allegorical inter pretation of the Creation and Fall Origen believes that the creation of man in God's image in Gen. 1,26f denotes the creation of the rational being (the inner man). After this comes a Fall that involves the origin of corpo rality. Both Gen. 2,7 and Gen. 3,21 deal with this origin of corporality. It is possible that in certain contexts (e.g. in his Genesis commentary) Ori gen distinguished between different forms of corporality, so that Gen. 2,7 denoted the origin of a finer spiritual body, while Gen. 3,21 denoted the origin of the rougher material body. The crucial distinction, however, lies between Gen. 1,26f and Gen. 2,7, between the inner and the outer man, between an incorporeal and a corporeal existence. This also means that the decisive Fall is the fall of the rational being in pre-existence and not the fall of the first human in Paradise. Origen has not therefore, as Procopius sug gested, followed the structure in Gen. 1-3 slavishly. His allegorical reading has enabled him to avoid such a schematic interpretation.

In C Cels. 7,50 Origen answers Celsus' charge that the Christians are totally bound to the flesh.56 Celsus justifies this criticism by claiming that the Christians are unable to distinguish between being and coming into being.57 Celsus is here using the well-known Platonic distinction between on the one hand actual being in its true sense, which is immutable and therefore everlasting, and on the other hand non-being in its true sense, because it comes into being and is therefore mutable and corruptible. To this Ori gen responds that this distinction is well-known among Christians. He adduces as proof of this a number of OT statements among others, which all show that the ancient prophets often claimed that what comes into being, i.e. the corporeal, is corruptible, whereas the true man, i.e. the soul, is incorruptible and everlasting. In this context there is a reference to Adam, who was expelled from Paradise for his sin. Origen refers first to Ps. 43,20 (LXX): You humbled us at the place of suffering.58 55) Such a distinction can be found e.g. in Hennessey, A Philosophical Issue in Origen's Eschatology: The Three Senses of Incorporality,' Origeniana Quinta, ed. R.J. Daley, Leuven University Press, Leuven 1992, 373-380 and in H.S. Schlibli, 'Origen, Didymus, and the Vehicle of the Soul', Origeniana Quinta, ed. RJ. Daley, Leuven University Press, Leuven 1992, 381-382. This is because without reservation they understand Origen's interpreta tion of Gen. 2,7 and 3,21 partly in the light of what the later tradition says concerning his interpretation of these texts, and partly in the light of what Origen himself says about the resurrected body. 56) Cf.

Jacobsen / Vigiliace Christianae 62 (2008) 213-232 He then identifies this place of suffering with the earthly surroundings into which Adam was cast after his sin.59 From the context it is clear that the reference is to the true man's or rational being's incorporation into a body, as Origen's reference to Paul's statement that he longs to break away from the body in order to be at home with the Lord (2. Cor. 5,6.8). Ori gen understands this as Paul's confirmation that the true man-the rational being-is bound to his body against his nature. Here at least we have a hint that Origen could interpret the Fall in Gen. 3 as an account of the fall of the everlasting, incorporeal being, whereby it assumed a body.60 It is reasonable to assume that the most important reason why Origen only rarely uses the Fall in Gen. 3 as an occasion to speak of the fall of the pre-existent rational being is that the structure of the Creation and Fall in Gen. 1-3 has caused him problems in this respect. As can be seen from the above it is not in Gen. 3,21 but already in Gen. 2,7 that according to Ori gen the creation of the material body is mentioned. This material corporal 59) "..., 'KaKc?oEcoc'xcmov ??ycov xov 7t?p?y?iov X?710V, ?(p ?v eKpArjOdc ano xov 7tapa??iGOD ?i? xrjv KaK?av eXt\XvOev 6 A?ajn, o 7t?p ?Gxiv av6pa&gt;7to?" (C Cels. 7,50, Or?genes Werke Vol. 2,201,13-16). 60) There are indications of this interpretation of the Fall in C. Cels. 4,40; 6,43; 7,39. In the first two passages Origen refers directly to Plato's myth (Phaedrus 246), where he describes the soul as a winged team of two where one of the horses is of noble origin and the other is not. The bad horse pulls the other on and the team (i.e. the soul) loses its wings, falls to the ground and becomes incarnated in a body. In De princ. 3,6,3 Origen explains how at the consummation the rational beings will reach a perfect state which corresponds to their original creation state. In this state there will be no form of wickedness and death, since no one will desire to eat of the Tree of Knowledge. In this state the rational beings are without bodies. This suggests the degree to which sin, corporality and death belong together in Origen. This is confirmed by among others Com. Joh. 1,20, Or?genes Werke Vol. 4, 25,1-7; 13,34, Or?genes Werke Vol. 4, 259,34-260,4, where man's corruptibility and mortality are seen as a precise consequence of his transgression of the commandment not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge. Cf. also a number of passages in Com. Rom. (e.g. 3,3, Fontes Christiani Vol. 2/2, 68-70; 5,1, Fontes Christiani Vol. 2/3, 30-82; 10,14, Fontes Christiani Yol 2/5, 232-34), where the first man's sin, in accordance with Paul (cf. Rom. 5,12) is regarded as the cause of man's mortality. Here it becomes clear, however, that Origen goes further than Paul by expressly equating man's mortality with his corporality, Cf. Com. Rom. 5,1, Fontes Christiani Vol. 2/3, 50,8-12: "Per unum ergo hominem peccatum introivit in hunc mun dum". "Mundus" autem, ut diximus, intelligendus est vel locus, in quo habitant homines, vel terrena et corporalis vita, in qua mors habet locum; cui mundo, hoc est terrenae vitae, crucifixos se dicunt sancti et mortuos". Finally see also Hom. Gen. 15,5, where Origen says that the first formed man came down to this world (i.e. the material world) after his expul sion from Paradise.</page><page sequence="19">Genesis 1-3 as Source for Origen 231 ity is a consequence of the rational beings' fall. It also means that Origen has a structural or chronological problem with the position of the Fall in Gen. 3 after the account of the body's creation in Gen. 2,7. He doubtless discussed this problem in his Genesis-commentary,61 but on the basis of the present texts it is impossible precisely to reconstruct his answer to the problem. We can only say that he probably understood the Fall in Gen. 3 as a mythologically cast account of the rational beings' fall and incarnation. Conclusion The above examination of Origen's exegesis of Gen. 1-3 has concentrated on his interpretation of the verses 1,26f, 2,7 and 3,21 and their internal relation. According to Origen they deal with the creation of the inner and the outer man respectively. On the background of the preserved texts the crucial difference is between Gen. 1,26f on the one hand and Gen. 2,7 and 3,21 on the other, since Gen. 1,26 deals with the creation of the inner man, while the two others deal with various aspects of the creation of the body. However, the relation between the latter two texts is not clearly described in the textual tradition. According to Procopius of Gaza, for exam ple, Origen may have claimed that Gen. 2,7 described the creation of a spiritual body, while Gen. 3,21 described the creation of the earthly body. This question could probably have been resolved from Origen's commen tary on Genesis, but unfortunately this is lost. It is nevertheless character istic of the preserved texts that Gen. 1,26f and Gen. 2,7 are often treated together, whereas Gen. 3,21 is only seldom included. According to Origen Gen. 1,26f is about the creation of the inner man in the image of God, meaning that he is created in the likeness of the Logos, the Son, who is God's image. The Logos is thus an intermediary between God and the inner man, thereby ensuring both the relationship and the distance between God and man. Origen maintains that it is the inner man, the soul, that is created in God's image and that this inner man is immaterial. His connection to the body is the consequence of the Fall and not of his creation in God's image. For God is entirely immaterial and nothing that is created in His image can therefore be material. The creation of the inner man in God's image does not mean that he is divine, but that 61) It is clear from among others C Cels. 4,39 that Origen really did attempt to provide a coherent interpretation of the first chapters of Genesis, including the account of the Fall in Gen. 3.</page><page sequence="20">232 A.L. Jacobsen / Vigiliae Christianae 62 (2008) 213-232 on crucial points he participates in the divine nature. The inner man is therefore also invisible, as well as immortal and incorruptible, everlasting and so on. Gen. 2,7 describes in contrast to Gen. 1,26f the creation of the outer man. Origen's exegesis of this verse is not explicit and independent, but is nearly always derived from his exegesis of Gen. 1,26f. The outer man is therefore described largely in an antithetical relation to the inner man: The outer man is corporeal, visible, mortal, corruptible and so on. Unlike the inner man, the outer man is a temporary phenomenon. In the few places where Origen refers explicitly to Gen. 3,21 there is no clear picture of how he interprets this verse. The most precise observation we can make is that in his view the skin coats denote the mortal corporality that surrounds the inner man. In Origen there does not therefore seem to be any difference between the body whose creation is mentioned in Gen. 2,7 and that which is mentioned in Gen. 3,21, though the preserved text material is too narrow for us to be able to reject the possibility in Origen of two qualitatively different forms of corporality in Gen. 2,7 and 3,21. Such a distinction between a spiritual corporality and an earthly corporal ity in connection with the Creation would correspond to the distinction he makes between these two forms of corporality in connection with his eschatology. It is clear, however, that according to Origen there is a fundamental distinction between the inner man created in God's image and the outer man who is not. Equally clear is the fact that Origen's interest is focussed on the inner man and his path from creation to consummation. The outer man, the body, only interests Origen insofar as it plays a role for the inner man.</page></plain_text>
