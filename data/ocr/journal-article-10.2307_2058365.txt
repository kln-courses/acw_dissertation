<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Religious Dimensions of Confucianism. By RODNEY L. TAYLOR. Albany, N.Y.: State University of New York Press, 1990. 198 pp. $49.50 (cloth); $16.95 (paper). The sinologist Okada Takehiko wrote a book several years ago in which his study of Sung dynasty Neo-Confucian philosophy began from his porcelains. His argument was that you begin to understand the Confucian thinker from his art. Rodney Taylor then wrote a book on Okada-The Confucian Way of Contemplation: Okada Takehiko and the Tradition of Quiet-Sitting-in which he argued that the cultivated character of the Confucian philosopher is his most precious artifact. Wonderful. In Taylor's collection of essays, some of them new, some reprinted, all of them interesting and important, he offers a related challenge. He claims that not only is Confucianism, from start to finish, profoundly religious, but this religious character is its center, its quintessential feature. The reluctance of Western scholarship to factor religious sensibilities into its interpretation of Confucianism has skewed our reading of the tradition in the direction of "grey" theory and has, in so doing, impoverished it. I couldn't agree more. The essays are panoramic. In championing the existential aspect of Confucianism, Taylor draws his demonstrations from the broad sweep of the tradition. In his examination of the classical literature, he wants to seek out the commonalities between "sage" and "saint" and, in so doing, uncover the religious dimensions of "sage." He looks to the Ming dynasty autobiographies of Kao P'an-lung and Hu Chih as</page><page sequence="2">138 THE JOURNAL OF ASIAN STUDIES an Augustine-like accounts of religious self-transformation and affirmations of faith. With Hu Chih, often described as a syncretist because of his sustained Buddhist interests, the temptation of Buddhism is present, but does not undermine the purity of his Confucian commitment and its ultimate truth-value. He draws parallels between Judeo-Christian models of "suffering"-retributive, pedagogical, sacrificial, and vicarious suffering-and the Confucian experience. The last essay is a sophisticated Confucian response to the perennial questions of humanity and our present religious quandary by bringing us "face to face" with the tradition in the persons of Tu Weiming and Okada Takehiko. Taylor's scholarship is original and, at the level of detail, it is unassailable. At the same time, my reservations concerning his approach to the sources are fundamental. The last work Leibniz wrote was his Discours sur la theologie naturelle des Chinois. Like most of his Eurocentric contemporaries, his primary interest in exalting China was to use it to corroborate the universal indices of his own cultural and religious tradition. When the structuralist Levi-Strauss insisted that transformations of high civilizations occurred in an axial age only once these civilizations had discovered "transcendence," Ben Schwartz found transcendence in the Chinese tradition. When it became rather plain the pre-Han Chinese tradition had no developed mythology comparable to the classical Greeks and Romans, Derk Bodde proposed a "reverse euhemerization"- a Confucian conspiracy to transform mythology into history-to account for its absence. From our early seventeenth-century encounters with this culture up to the present moment, we Western sinologists have been vigilant in our efforts to spare the Chinese world its radical difference. If religious sensibility is at the core of the Confucian tradition, and I believe it is, is the best approach to foreground only those resonances with the categories that structure the Judeo-Christian experience and, in so doing, stand up to the danger of burying what is truly exotic about the Chinese? Should Confucian religiousness be discussed in the familiar language of absolute Deity, salvation, faith, hope, exclusive truth-value, suffering, conscience, scripture, saint, and so on, or, to avoid equivocation, do we need a different vocabulary to do justice to what is peculiar to the Confucian religio-humanism? To take the first term, t'ien, as an example: To translate t'ien as "Heaven" and give it the value of transcendent Absolute comparable to the Judeo-Christian model is perhaps to report on the anthropomorphism we find in the early classics, but to set aside precisely those religious dimensions that make this tradition markedly different from our own. The pervasive assumption of t'ien jen ho-i-the claim there is continuity between t'ien and humanity-would suggest it is not religious faith and commitment to the Way of Heaven that defines Confucian religiousness, but the ongoing creation of meaning and value in the world. If, rather than insisting on our own structures, we take seriously the perception that Confucian gods are, by and large, dead people, we can then explain ancestor worship and the veneration of cultural and political heroes as gods. Historical figures such as Confucius ascend to become gods by doing the work generally attributed to God in our world: the man Confucius is one non-exclusive source of truth, beauty, and goodness for the cultural tradition. Confucianism is thus a theopomorphism. If human beings do the work of gods and thus can become gods, is it surprising that shen means both human spirituality and divinity? And if enculturated human beings are divine, do we need the relationship between the sage and Heaven to make an autobiography "religious," or is this a religiousness which is pursued for the most part in the ritual relationships which obtain among persons themselves?</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS-CHINA AND INNER ASIA 139 The concern in exploring the religious dimensions of Confucianism should be to identify and lift to the surface those peculiar features of a Confucian t'ien that are in danger of receding in our necessarily parochial reading and interpretation of the texts-after all, unlike God, it is temporal, historical, geographically specific, hylozoistic, humanistic. After all, if we aren't reductionists, isn't it the profound difference that ought to recommend our interest in the first place? The Confucian tradition is, at its core, religious, but Taylor must stretch his imagination further than he has to find the vocabulary necessary to articulate a Confucian religiousness. ROGER T.
