<plain_text><page sequence="1">FERNAND LEGER The Art Institute of Chicago on April 2 opens the first comprehensive American exhibition of the work of Fernand L6ger, who along with Picasso, Braque and Matisse is often described as one of the four greatest artists working in France during the twentieth century. Noted in particu- lar for his large bold canvases, L6ger is the exponent par excellence of our scientific and mecha- nistic age. Though his permanent home is Paris, he has spent much time in America, a country where mass production, speeding trains, stainless steel and jazz music have afforded endless themes for his paintings. Throughout his long development (L6ger is over seventy) his main interest has been and still is centered on strong functional color, on magnified, isolated objects drawn from everyday life and on the most careful proportions. His is a gay and optimistic art, less concerned with psy- chological probings than with the visual brilliance of our machine age. The current exhibition gives a full-scale survey of LUger's. work, including not only a large proportion of his most famous paintings but in addition water colors, drawings, motion picture experiments, theatre, ballet and stained glass window designs, also ceramics and tapestries. Important loans from American collections and many well-known works never seen before in the United States, except in reproduction, have been invited from Europe: from France, Bel- gium, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and Holland. Some few of these paintings are here reproduced with brief comments, in many cases by the artist himself. Organized by The Art Institute of Chicago, this exhibition will travel to two collaborating museums, the San Francisco Museum of Art and The Museum of Modern Art in New York. A comprehensive catalogue with explanatory text accompanying each important painting has been written by Katharine Kuh who also selected the exhibition. Excerpts from the catalogue are included in this article. The Seamstress. 1913. Lent by Galerie Rosengart, Lucerne, Swit- zerland In 1913 a boldness which is to characterize much of L6ger's work appears for the first time. The Seamstress, painted in broad areas of strong color, is concerned with massive ovals, cylinders and cubes, the entire design pulsating with white highlights typical of the artist's work during this particular year. Never a traditional Cubist, though often erroneously con- sidered so, Leger's interest in mo- tion is evident in this painting where overlapping curves move upward in an almost syncopated pattern, recalling Futurism more than Cubism. 22</page><page sequence="2">(0C ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO Three Musicians by Lager.

Lent by Rijksmuseum Kr6ller-Miiller, Otterlo, Holland During the first World War LUger designed breech-blocks for guns and served as a stretcher bearer. The brutality, camaraderie and brilliance of mechanized modern battle fascinated him and reinforced his interest in hard forms and unrelenting surfaces. He completed The Card Players while recovering from having been gassed. Of these years he wrote, "... During those four war years I was abruptly thrust into a reality which was both blinding and new. I was dazzled by the breech of a 75 millimeter gun which was standing uncovered in the sunlight: the magic of light on white metal. This was enough to make me forget the abstract art of 1912-13. A complete revelation to me, both as a man and as a painter."

Lent by the Baroness Gourgaud, Yerres, France Only a year ago Leger said, "One may consider the human figure not for its senti- mental value but only for its plastic value. That is why in the evolution of my work since 1905 until now the human figure has remained purposely inexpressive." Though the surface of this canvas has been painted with tender luminosity, the two women remain sexless. Their necks rise like columns and their hair has the hardness of metal reflecting light. More integrated parts of a composition than individualized person- alities, these figures are so impersonally handled, so classically devoid of emotion as to be almost denials of the human body. 24</page><page sequence="5">Maquette for a Mural. 1938. Lent by Jean Masurel, Mouvaux, France Because of early architectural training L6ger, better than most artists, understands the prob- lems of mural painting. He once said, "For my- self I cannot see nowadays any justification for murals setting forth the major religious, military or social issues; these can be so adequately dealt with by books, the cinema and radio." In Maquette for a Mural the artist has used brilliant color, vertical movement and magnified details to sug- gest a landscape. Here he allows a few generalized leaf and cloud forms to substitute for a more traditional view of nature. 25</page><page sequence="6">Leisure. 1944-49. Lent by the Mus6e National d'Art Moderne, Paris Though Leisure was started in America, L6ger did not finish this can- vas until three years after he returned to France. The people, bicy- cles, birds and flowers on first view seem related to paintings done in the United States during the last war but, on further study, one finds a classicism typical of the artist's work prior to his visit. Because the color is strong and the light brilliant, memories of America are still present, but the rushing movement and centrifugal compositions of those years have vanished and in their place appears a more serene design, quiet, resolved and non-explosive. That Leger was aware of his return to French classicism is evident by his semi- ironic inscription paying tribute to David. He might also have in- cluded the name of Henri Rousseau, for this painting seems dedi- cated, at least in spirit, to the French bourgeoisie which the Douanier understood so well.</page><page sequence="7">IL irr K444 00-. lopp lip. rllr/All</page><page sequence="8">01?

Lent by the artist "In The Builders," wrote L6ger, "I tried to achieve the most violent contrasts by opposing minutely realistic human figures with clouds and metallic structures." The artist's most recent series of paintings grows out of European reconstruction after the war. Entranced by the hammering, welding and riveting which surrounded him where- ever he traveled, he responded to this rebirth of hope and archi- tecture with a group of drawings, water colors and paintings which he called The Builders. It was inevitable that he should be attracted by the beauty of unfinished steel structures and consistent that he should contrast these open geometric shapes with the same solid, anthropomorphic clouds which distinguish many of his early paintings. In addition to contrasting human and geometric forms, a problem L6ger has always enjoyed, he also is concerned here with implications of growth and suggestions of limitless space.</page></plain_text>
