<plain_text><page sequence="1">Antitrust Limits on Distribution Policies and Programs RELATIONSHIP OF ANTITRUST TO CONVENTIONAL LEGAL CATEGORIES By Paul C. Warnke Member of the District of Columbia Bar My exact role in this program is, I am afraid, as mysterious as the cryptic title. I am informed by our Chairman, however, that mine is intended to be a round-up paper which will relate the preceding presentations to one another. This idea of a round-up?and of impressing my own brand on this distinguished antitrust herd?is an intoxicating one. But the particu lar mavericks with whom I have been presented seem to me uncom monly difficult to corral. So is the job of relating their topics, each of which by itself is complex and controversial. The only real family resemblance I can see in these presentations is their consistent excel lence. But there has been, I think, one major recurring theme in these thought-provoking analyses of various of the limits that antitrust laws impose on distribution policies. The various papers note the growing recognition that antitrust enforcement is not advanced either by spawning additional per se antitrust offenses or by expanding the existing categories. Thus Professor Brown has pointed out that to use Section 2(e) of the Clayton Act for an attempted per se resolution of the legality of selling less than a full line to certain customers is to employ a blunt tool. Commissioner Maclntyre has referred to the difficulties encoun tered by the antitrust enforcement agencies in skirting the per se precedents in the retail co-op advertising controversy. Mr. Flinn has noted that application of full blown per se rules may impede the pro motion of small business. Mr. Jones has discussed the approach taken by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Lessig v. Tidewater Oil Co.1?which displays a curiosity about the facts that seems to go beyond the Standard Stations2 reading of Section 3 of the Clayton Act. Mr. Potvin has commented on the Snap-On Tool3 case, which appears to show a "rule of reason" review of restrictions on distribu 1327 F.2d 459 (9th Cir. 1964), cert, denied, 377 U.S. 993 (1964). 2 Standard Oil Co. of Cal. v.

Mr. Kaapcke has criticized the imposition of an economic strait jacket through per se competitive effect application of the Robinson Patman Act. Even the Supreme Court's White Motor* decision exhibits some doubt as to how per se a per se rule really should be. There the Court remanded the case for full trial with the curious suggestion that anal ysis of the business facts on territorial restrictions in the truck industry would put the court in a position to determine whether they should be found to be per se in violation of the Sherman Act?that is, so unlawful that examination of the facts as to operating actualities would be unnecessary. Justice Brennan's concurrence explained the kind of facts that could support territorial restriction. But on a true per se approach, it would seem that actual operating facts are irrel evant.5 Possibly the Court felt that a practice which has almost survived the Diamond Jubilee of the Sherman Act might conceivably have something good to say for itself. The topic which thus emerges as a connecting thread in today's program is one which requires taking a position on the hardest of antitrust issues: that is, should antitrust enforcement aim at the development of specific rules which will permit a degree of certainty in antitrust advice, or should these laws receive a flexible interpretation directed towards implementation of their underlying policy, with a concomitant sacrifice of certainty. The more per se antitrust becomes, the clearer become the rules of the game. But maybe all the fun gets taken out of the game as well and certainly it no longer takes a lawyer to play it. I question that this sacrifice is necessary in the interests of effective enforcement. Put even more primitively, the question underlying my topic is whether the antitrust laws in fact deal with form or with substance. The answer given by the cases is apparently that they deal with both or, at times, whichever will result in a decision against the defendant. But perhaps the difficulty in resolving this question derives from the fact that the antitrust laws themselves face in both directions. The Sherman Act's generality permits challenge of any form of con tractual or consensual relationship which can be characterized as an unreasonable restraint of trade. Thus in the Yellow Cab Co. case the Supreme Court said of the Sherman Act: "That statute is aimed at 4 White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253 (1963). 5 See, e.g., Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5 (1958) (Per se offenses "conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the busi ness excuse for their use.")</page><page sequence="3">146 RELATIONSHIP OF ANTITRUST TO CONVENTIONAL LEGAL CATEGORIES substance rather than form."6 Similarly, if I may classify Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act as an antitrust law, for present purposes only and yielding nothing to potential treble damage plain tiffs, it too supports attack on business conduct, regardless of form, when the Commission deems it to be an unfair act or practice in com merce. The Clayton Act, on the contrary, was designed to isolate and proscribe specific forms of business conduct or practice which Congress regarded as peculiarly inimical to competition. In considering the difference between the relationships which the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act bear to conventional legal cate gories, a couple of the Supreme Court cases involving the distribu tion of gasoline may be helpful. Certainly since Prohibition and the demise of rum running there has been no area of the economy in which distribution practices have aroused more legal action. The first of these cases, Simpson v. Union Oil Co. of California,7 was brought under the Sherman Act. It involved what the majority opinion agreed was a perfectly valid consignment. The gasoline refiner kept title to the gasoline and set the price at which it was sold to the public. But the Supreme Court stated: "a consignment, no matter how lawful it might be as a matter of private contract law, must give way before the federal antitrust policy."8 And the Court found that the consignment contracts amounted to vertical price fix ing in violation of the Sherman Act. As the Clayton Act case for contrast, let's consider Standard Sta tions,9 which involved a challenge of requirements contracts between a refiner and independent service station operators. The Supreme Court found that these contracts contravened the quite narrow pro hibition of Section 3 which prohibits sales or leases on condition that the purchaser not use or deal in the goods of a competitor of the seller. In finding these requirements contracts unlawful, the majority opinion by Justice Frankfurter states that: "Before the system of requirements contracts was instituted, Standard sold gasoline through independent service-station operators as its agents, and it might revert to this system if the judgment were sustained." The opinion recognizes that this alternative would be "just as effective as the use of requirements contracts," but observes that the Court is dealing with "a particular form of agreement specified by ? 3 and not with 6 United States v.

WARNKE 147 different arrangements, by way of integration or otherwise, that may tend to lessen competition. Under the Clayton Act the Court con cludes, Congress determined that the particular practices described by Section 3 are "detrimental where their effect may be to lessen com petition." The alternatives of agency agreements or vertical inte gration, on the other hand, encounter only the Sherman Act provi sions.10 So, if we can confine our attention just to Standard Stations and Union Oil, the answer to our inquiry is a simple one?the Clayton Act deals with form and the Sherman Act deals with substance. And possibly this would be a fairly livable kind of an antitrust world, where adoption of a particular form of business conduct or business organization, entirely lawful by common law, contract law and cor porate law standards, would lead to antitrust difficulties only if it were singled out by the Clayton Act?or where it could be shown in fact to have restrained trade unreasonably in violation of the Sherman Act. But this distinction between the two Acts?however appealing in theory?has not been followed consistently by the courts or by the Federal Trade Commission. It appears to work on a fairly elementary level. Obviously antitrust considerations sometimes override and supersede the traditional legal criteria which would validate a particu lar form of business organization or practice. That is, of course, exactly what they were intended to do in some instances. Thus the fact that an agreement among competitors may have valid considera tion and may be binding on the parties under all contract law principles won't save it if it provides for division of territories or an agreed upon set of price differentials. Or the fact that proxies have been properly solicited and all SEC requirements met, and a valid stockholder vote taken, isn't sufficient to save a merger which can be found to present a reasonable likelihood of lessened competition in any line of commerce in any section of the country. But where the Clayton Act does not deal explicitly with the busi ness form or practice there is, I submit, a very real question whether the antitrust legality of otherwise legal conduct should be determined under per se concepts or under a Clayton Act type of test on the theory that it adds up to the same kind of result as something specifically dealt with by Congress. Instead, where the form of conduct is lawful apart from antitrust considerations, and where it has not been spelled out in the Clayton Act as presumptively anti-competitive, I believe that the Sherman Act rule of reason approach should be given free rein. And I would hope, along with Mr. Flinn, that the courts would not in 10 Id. at 310-11.</page><page sequence="5">148 RELATIONSHIP OF ANTITRUST TO CONVENTIONAL LEGAL CATEGORIES voke per se concepts in situations which fall into one of the relatively limited per se categories only by a strained or overly literal approach. These per se categories are, after all, creatures of the Court rather than of the Congress. Mr. Flinn has referred to Justice Douglas' statement in Socony Vacuum that legislation might be required to change the per se ille gality of price fixing.11 But the Court isn't quite in the helpless posi tion of Dr. Frankenstein and it can make its monster get back in the box when there are just friends around. Without suggesting aban donment of the per se approach to the hard core violations, there cer tainly seems no purpose in extending them by analogy, or even by inadvertence. And it is this possibility that troubles me about the majority opinion in the Union Oil case. We may assume for purposes of anal ysis that the Court correctly concluded that the generality of the Sherman Act permitted its use to bring the Union Oil consignments within its broad coverage. But the Court proceeds to condemn the consignments as per se violative of that Act. Even more troublesome for my thesis is the Court's reference to Standard Fashion Co. v. Magrane-Houston Co.12 The Court reads that case as standing for the proposition that "a consignment is not allowed to be used as a cloak to avoid ? 3 of the Clayton Act."13 Does this comment mean that a consignment in the Standard Stations type of situation could be held to violate Section 3?under the probable competitive effects test of the Clayton Act?despite the bona fides of the consignment as a matter of contract law ? If so, then there's no merit in my suggestion that the Clayton Act deals with particular business forms and that the Sherman Act deals, though more delicately, with matters of substance. But as I read the Magrane-Houston case, the Court there did not find that a consignment violated Section 3 because it achieved the same result as an exclusive dealing contract. It found instead that there wasn't really any consignment but rather a sale, and hence a form of business conduct clearly covered by Section 3.14 Perhaps this distinction is what is troubling Justice Brennan and Justice Goldberg in their Memorandum Opinion in Union Oil. There they state that the Court should not find these consignment arrangements n United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 222 (1940). 12 258 U.S. 346 (1922). is 377 U.S. at 18. 14 "Full title and dominion passed to the buyer.

They would not treat the consignment agreement, because it may achieve the same results as a resale price maintenance agreement between a seller and his customer, as coming within the per se category of Sherman Act violations. To decide that the Union Oil consignments violate the Sherman Act, it certainly wasn't necessary to call them sales. However, Justice Douglas says, for the majority, that the antitrust laws prevent "calling the Consignment' an agency."15 But no matter what you call it, you can still reach it as an unreasonable restraint of trade under the Sherman Act. And why call the consignment a sale, which it isn't, and thus throw it to the per se wolves, when many if not most con signments don't unreasonably restrain trade at all ? There would seem to be even less justification for the Court, in a case brought under Section 3, to call a legally effective consignment a sale on the ground that it has an effect similar to that of an exclusive dealing contract between a seller and his customer. Surely consignments aren't and can't be treated as sales for all antitrust purposes. Any such disregard of the conventional legal category?and bailment with its myriad of common law forms is as time-honored a concept as exists in the law?would lead to ludicrous results. Take for example the situation under Section 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act. If a consignment to a broker were to be treated as a sale, the payment of the broker's commission would have to be regarded as the payment of brokerage to the other party to the sales transaction. But Mr. Kaapcke has commented on the Flotill case16 in which the Commission found that even technical passage of title to a broker didn't make payment of brokerage illegal under 2(c). Nor, I venture to predict, would Commissioner Maclntyre regard a legally effective consignment as excusing the consignor from any responsibility for the prices charged to those who take delivery from the consignee. Under the indirect customer doctrine, as recently enunciated in the Purolator case,17 even the manufacturer who passes title to a jobber is not excused from responsibility for discriminatory prices charged to the jobber's customers where he has control over the jobber's prices and other terms of sale. So our consignor could find himself with a fairly rugged choice. Since under conventional legal concepts he has control over the 15 377 U.S. at 21. i? Flotill Prod. Inc., 3 Trade Reg.

But exer cise of this legal control could, under a per se reading of Union Oil, lead to a Sherman Act prosecution for resale price maintenance. This legal impasse can readily be avoided by a rule of reason approach rather than a rigid Clayton Act method of dealing with a form of busi ness conduct which Congress has not specified as inherently anti competitive. No such expansion of per se concepts is necessarily inherent in the FTC's Sun Oil18 and Atlantic Refining19 decisions of a year ago. In Sun Oil, the Commission found that the refiner and its retailers met and agreed upon a consignment arrangement to maintain retail prices. It held the plan unlawful, "not because it did not constitute a genuine consignment under the law of agency, but because the proof showed it to be a vertical and horizontal price fixing device."20 In Atlantic, the consignment was found to be an on-again, off-again phenomenon developed to cope with price wars. But in neither case did the Commission call a consignment a sale in order to reach its decision. If in these cases the refiners had always distributed through a consignment system, developed for business reasons that had noth ing to do with the antitrust laws, the results might well have been quite different on the Commission's analysis. The Union Oil "just the same as" approach?however justified in Sherman Act cases governed by a rule of reason test?surely should not be used to expand the Clayton Act or per se categories. The dictum in Union Oil that the Court should not "make legality for antitrust purposes turn on clever draftsmanship"21 has some surface appeal. But I question whether it can properly be carried to the point where bailments become sales, or services become commod ities, or joint participation in a new venture becomes acquisition of a going business, just because this makes it easier to rule against a defendant. Perhaps the most conspicuous example of the use of the spirit of the Clayton Act to handle situations with which Congress failed is Sun Oil Co., 1961-1963 Trade Reg. Rep. (Transf.

WARNKE 151 to deal specifically has occurred in proceedings against buyers charged with inducing discriminatory advertising and promotional allowances. In such cases as American News22 and Giant Food23 and R. H. Macy2* the Federal Trade Commission has developed its proposition that, although Section 2(f) of the Robinson-Patman Act reads only against the knowing receipt of discriminations in price, this loophole in the Act can be filled by a Commission proceeding under Section 5. Here again, in the resulting Section 5 proceedings the Commission and the courts have followed traditional Clayton Act criteria. Profes sor Brown has observed that these cases were tried as if they had been brought under Section 2(f). But, as the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded, the Clayton Act approach in this Section 5 context has some justification. Mr. Flinn has noted that Sec tion 2(d) of the Act singles out discriminatory promotional allow ances as per se violations. Congress has specified this very form of conduct as unlawful. Accordingly, in a Section 5 proceeding against the buyer, the illegality of the payment is necessarily establishlished under Clayton Act criteria. To hold the buyer responsible, the only remaining question is whether he knew or should have known the seller was acting illegally. But in these cases, the Commission hasn't found that promotional allowances are lower prices?although, as Professor Brown has remarked, it wouldn't take much effort to classify them as indirect price discriminations.25 To sum up where I think this analysis gets us, there seems no escape from having to look at form in the instances where Congress has decreed in the Clayton Act that particular forms of business practice should be subject to more rigid regulation. An acquisition of a competitor may, for example, be less damaging to smaller com panies in the field than internal expansion and the creation of addi tional production facilities in an industry that is already over-capacity. The acquisition, however, is subject to the strictures of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, whereas the internal growth can be challenged only under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, where the standard of proof required of the Government is a far more taxing one. But, I submit, no court would be justified in finding the internal expansion to be an acquisition because it has the same or an even worse effect. 22 American News Co. v.

If the form doesn't fit the Clayton Act, there still remains the Sherman Act, under which any legal instrument?no matter how craftily designed?may be found to be in unreasonable restraint of trade. If I am correct, then, legal form is and properly should be taken into consideration in advising on antitrust matters. Nor would a court be warranted in disregarding legal form where, under the anti trust laws as Congress wrote them, it is made controlling. But at the same time, there seem to me to be instances in which too much atten tion has been paid to form at the sacrifice of substance. There sometimes seems to be a momentum which yields a finding of violation because the form of activity has been involved in a pre viously adjudicated case. I think there is a little of this in the exclusive dealing or requirements contract field. In instances where the number of potential outlets is virtually infinite, where the number of competent and qualified distributors is more than adequate, and an exclusive dealing commitment will neither preclude competitors from access to the market nor restrict consumers in their choice, an exclusive dealing contract or requirements contract Really has little or no adverse economic impact.26 In some instances, too, concentration on the legal form has, in my opinion, blinded courts to substance. At times there appears to be unthinking adherence to inapposite per se precedents. Take for example the intra-enterprise conspiracy phenomenon. I don't propose to argue that price fixing engaged in by corporations that should be competitors is not properly regarded as a per se unreasonable restraint of trade. Nor would I question anthropomorphic concepts of a corporation that go back to Blackstone and beyond. But price fixing, after all, is challenged under the Sherman Act's prohibition of agreements in restraint of trade. And where two corporations are in a parent-subsidiary relationship or are wholly-owned subsidiaries of a common parent, their common, or if you will, "conspiratorial," conduct in setting prices or dividing markets does not seem to me to involve in any respect any restraint of trade. 26 Cf. Lessig v. Tidewater Oil Co., 327 F.2d 459 (9th Cir. 1964), cert denied, 377 U.S. 993 (1964).</page><page sequence="10">PAUL C. WARNKE 153 To put it another way, price fixing is bad because it suppresses price competition. But there is no provision of the Clayton Act that says that it is automatically unlawful for separate corporations to agree on price or act collectively, even when they are component parts of a single enterprise. The fact that separate corporations are legally separate entities and that the courts have concluded that it is per se unlawful for competitors to fix prices or to boycott custom ers doesn't require the further conclusion that all separate corpora tions engaged in the same field should be competitors. In trying to deal with the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine, I don't think it is necessary to refute the notion that separate corpora tions in a single business enterprise are capable of conspiring. But the Sherman Act does not make conspiracy illegal. Conspiracy, after all, is just a dirty name for agreement on a common course of action. The presidents of competing corporations can "conspire" to support the Community Chest without violating the antitrust laws. In addition to conspiracy, a Section 1 offense requires a showing of restraint of trade. This second element is usually missing in the intra-enterprise conspiracy situation. In the Kiefer-Stewart case,27 the Supreme Court found a viola tion of Section 1 in the fact that two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Seagrams Company agreed to cut off a liquor dealer who insisted on selling above a maximum price. I won't presume to argue the merits of the particular decision, but I am troubled about the language of the opinion and the interpretation thereafter placed on it both by commentators and by the Federal Trade Commission. Because a year or so later, the Federal Trade Commission brought Section 5 proceedings against Seagrams and against Schenley's.28 Each case was based on the simple fact that the wholly-owned distillery subsidiaries of each enterprise were under common control by a single parent. In other words, the Chairman of the Board of Seagrams talked about the price of the enterprise's products with the heads of the wholly-owned Seagrams subsidiaries. Price setting was equated with price-fixing. These cases were disposed of by consent settlements which included compliance reports under which the corporate sales sub sidiaries were changed to divisions of a single corporation. This type of antitrust enforcement can only be characterized as obsession with legal form devoid of any substantive connotations. The only thing 27Kiefer-Stewart Co. v.

In his instructive talk, Commissioner Maclntyre has suggested that the Sunkist29 case shows that a similar antitrust restriction does not exist in the case of a multi-corporate farmer co-operative. I am quite hopeful, however, that the Sunkist case indicates that the Kiefer Stewart opinion need not be read as literally as the Commission did in its proceedings against Seagrams and Schenley's. In Sunkist, the court held that there was no violation of the Sherman Act where the growers formed three separate corporations to engage in the concerted processing and marketing contemplated by the Capper Volstead Act. The court stated: "... there is no indication that the use of separate corporations had economic significance in itself or that outsiders dealt with the three entities as inde pendent organizations."30 This, to me, is encouragingly reminiscent of the statement in the Kiefer-Stewart opinion that the conduct of the affiliated corporations was illegal "especially . . . where, as here, respondents hold them selves out as competitors.,,31 But at the same time, the Sunkist opinion appears to proceed on the assumption that, in order to avoid the automatic application of the per se doctrines of the Sherman Act, the court had to find that the three legal entities formed by Sunkist were not independent parties for purposes of the conspiracy provisions of the Act. I would think that the courts could accept the facts that, in traditional legal conceptual terms, there were three legal entities and that they were capable of engaging in a conspiracy. Nonetheless, because these separate corporations were not competitors and there was no legal reason why they should be competitors, their concerted action could not be in restraint of trade. The mere fact that an enterprise is organized into a multi corporate form, for tax or other non-antitrust reasons, should not lead to antitrust liability. If, of course, the fact of separate corpo rations were to be used somehow to effect adversely some outside party, the requisite element of a restraint of trade could be added to the corporate plurality to find a violation of the Sherman Act. Pre sumably this is what the Court has in mind when it speaks in Sunkist 29 Sunkist Growers, Inc. v. Winckler &amp; Smith Citrus Prod.

WARNKE 155 about outsiders dealing with entities as independent organizations and in Kief er-Stewart when it recites as justification for the result that the separate sales corporations of the Seagrams enterprise had held themselves out to be competitors. But if the courts are to find antitrust violation when two sub sidiaries of a single enterprise do what two divisions could do without raising any legal question, the resulting situation is a bit like Professor Higgins' complaint in "My Fair Lady": "The French don't care what they do as long as they pronounce it correctly." Certainly in other areas of the antitrust law the fact that a sepa rate corporation is put into the picture will not alter the antitrust consequences. I believe Professor Brown would feel there were some Section 2(e) problems if one subsidiary of a liquor company were to be used exclusively to sell a less expensive and less heavily adver tised line not offered to customers served by another subsidiary. Or we can suppose that the enterprise imports Scotch which is then offered for sale by both subsidiaries. One of the subsidiaries, however, sells only to a few large customers at an appreciably lower price than that offered by the other subsidiary to competing liquor dealers. In defense, the company cites Kiefer-Stewart and the consent settlement in Seagrams and Schenley's, and argues that the two subsidiaries are required by Section 1 of the Sherman Act to follow independent pricing policies. I have little confidence that this con tention would prevail. I think the Commission would conclude and the courts would agree that the enterprise had discriminated in price among its customers. Nor, if Commissioner Maclntyre and I read the Automotive Parts cases32 correctly, would the formation of a separate corporation by a group of jobbers always exonerate the jobbers from liability under Section 2(f) for discounts which that corporation obtains. The fact that the corporation has been organized and qualified in complete accordance with the corporation law of a sovereign state will appar ently not prevent the Commission from concluding that it isn't there at all and that the separate companies that own its stock are in fact the purchasers from the manufacturers. This then is an instance in which the conventional legal categories can be blithely disregarded where the Commission concludes that the corporate form is all the substance there is to the buying intermediary. 32 See, e.g., Mid-South Distributors v. FTC, 287 F.2d 512 (5th Cir. 1961), cert, denied, 368 U.S. 838 (1961); Standard Motor Prod., Inc. v.

The recent decision of the Supreme Court in Penn-Olin33 shows that corporate joint ventures, however valid under common law or corporate law, enjoy no favored position under the antitrust laws. There the Court found that the formation of a new corporation by Pennsalt and Olin Mathieson for the purpose of producing sodium chlorate constituted an acquisition prohibited under Section 7 of the Clayton Act. Justice Clark's opinion unabashedly notes that joint ventures have been utilized since ancient times and can be traced to the Babylonian "commenda" and the Roman "societas."34 No one would contend that this tradition requires judicial approval of every joint venture. But its standing as a discreet method of business conduct conforming to a conventional legal category is widely shaken by the Court's conclusion that when the two companies formed a new corporation for the purpose of thereafter engaging in commerce, they both somehow acquired a. corporation engaged in commerce as specified in Section 7 35 The opinion notes that the effect of an acquisition is to be tested as of the date of the lawsuit.36 But on this analysis an acquisition by a corporation of the assets of a partnership, engaged only in intra state commerce, could later be challenged under Section 7 if the acquiring corporation developed the business into an interstate operation. This treatment of post-acquisition developments as if they were pre-acquisition conditions is a little like making birth con trol retroactive. I think it does violence not only to conventional legal categories but to conventional time-space relationships. Finally, a recurrent theme in these discussions has been the still troublesome area of the right of customer selection. Here again is a conventional legal relationship which, in the case of the ordinary commercial enterprise, has been left to free selection. Under the common law, only innkeepers and proprietors of similar places of public accommodation were required to serve all orderly people. The producer of a commodity was free to select his distributors for any good or any bad reason. This right of customer selection obviously has been greatly eroded by the antitrust laws.

The court apparently based its ruling on the conclusion that permitting a supplier to cut off a distributor who was suing him under the anti trust laws would hamper antitrust enforcement. The antitrust restrictions on selection of customers clearly impinge on common law rights. The same can be said for many of the other legal relationships and traditional legal forms. Where Congress has specified certain ways of doing business as prohibited whenever they pose any reasonable likelihood of adverse competitive effect, the yielding of the traditional legal concept is unavoidable. Simi larly, no one with any affection for a competitive economy will mourn the elimination of contracts or agreements that unreasonably restrain trade. But implementation of the antitrust laws or of their spirit does not necessitate calling consignments sales or characterizing joint ventures as some type of in futuro acquisition. I think we can keep life in the law without doing violence to the English language. A flexible legal approach to the problems of our complex economy requires foregoing some per se certainty. It also requires faith in the ability of courts and the antitrust bar to distinguish the unrea sonable restraint from the rational and orderly marketing practice. The contribution this approach makes to the law business is obvious. But I think it's also good antitrust enforcement. 38 United States v.
