<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXPLANATION IN ARISTOTLE, NEWTON, AND TOULMIN* FRED WILSON University of Toronto Part IF The claim that scientific explanation is deductive has been attacked on both syste- matic and historical grounds. This paper briefly defends the claim against the systematic attack. Essential to this defence is a distinction between perfect and imperfect explana- tion. This distinction is then used to illuminate the differences and similarities between Aristotelian (anthropomorphic) explanations of certain facts and those of classical mechanics. In particular, it is argued that when one attempts to fit classical mechanics into the Aristotelian framework the latter becomes structurally incoherent. It is sug- gested that this, together with the fact that classical mechanics embodied the first piece of perfect knowledge, accounts, in part at least, for the historical fact of the rapid de- mise of the Aristotelian patterns as the new science developed. On the basis of this dis- cussion, the inadequacies of the attack on the deductive model on historical grounds by Toulmin come to be seen. If the ordinary examples do not justify the attempt to revive Aristotle's ideal of explanation, Toulmin need not rely upon them. For he has other, indeed far more crucial, examples. Toulmin also argues that Newtonian mechanics itself exemplifes the Aristotelian patterns. This second argument also fails. In the first place, Toulmin misrepresents the Aristotelian patterns. He ignores the case of Aristotelian processes accounted for in terms of internal forces; that is, he ignores Natural processes. He concentrates on only Natural states, and on Unnatural states and processes. That means he can play down the role of internal forces in the Aristotelian pat- terns, play up the role of external forces. Thus Aristotelian forces come to look like the "external forces" appealed to in classical mechanics. In the second place, he misrepresents the logical structure of classical mechanics. He fails to distinguish the role of the Law of Inertia as an axiom in the theory, developed by Newton, and which explains a large body of laws, and the role of the Law of Inertia as a piece of imperfect knowledge appealed to in order to explain, not laws, but in- dividual facts, certain facts about the behavior of certain objects under certain conditions. Blurring these roles, Toulmin is able to suggest that inertial motion is a case of an object being in a Natural Aristotelian state, and that noninertial motion is a case of an Unnatural state or process. In other words, by blurring these two roles of the Law of Inertia, Newtonian mechanics is made to look as if it fell within the Aristotelian patterns. In the third place, Toulmin illegitimately exploits the formulations of classical mechanics which were given by Newton himself. Newton himself was still half within the old framework. For Newton himself, forces were still thought of on the old anthropomorphic patterns. This, however, is not the logical structure of the theory he gave the world. Newton's successors * Received July, 1967 t Part I of this article appeared in the immediately preceding issue, Volume 36, no. 3, of this Journal. 400</page><page sequence="2">EXPLANATION IN ARISTOTLE. NEWTON, AND TOULMIN 401 soon came to realize this. The anthropomorphic language soon became a dead metaphor so far as the working physicist was concerned. If Newton was himself in the old and inadequate patterns of Aristotelian thought it is also true that it was he that killed these patterns by presenting the world with an example of a far more adequate, indeed perfect, kind of explanation, namely, the kind of explanation provided by process knowledge. But the transition began before Newton secured its success. The transition was facilitated by the discovery of the Law of Inertia. Because the transition had not been completed, the Law was often inadequately formulated in terms of the Aristotelian patterns. These blurs are also exploited by Toulmin. Unfortunately they have nothing to do with the logical structure of scientific explanation. To suppose that they do is to confuse logic with the sociology of scientific discovery. Before discussing what Toulmin has to say on the Law of Inertia it will therefore be necessary to discuss, first, the logical role of the Law in classical mechanics, and, second, the historical role of the Law in the transition from prescientific to scientific modes of explanation. Only then will we be in a position to criticize Toulmin. As I have already stated, the Law of Inertia has a dual role within classical mech- anics. We shall begin by discussing its role as an axiom. Four axioms are crucial: if any theory is to be classified as a case of classical, Newtonian, mechanics, these four must be among its axioms. The first of these amounts to the Law of Inertia; the other three will be needed in what has to be said about the notion of force in classical mechanics (cf. [9], Chap. 5, sec. 10; [25], chap. 57; [19], chap. 2, secs. 4-7). Classical mechanics answers the question how the motion of an object depends, lawfully, on circumstances. "Motion" is a matter of kinematics: it is described in terms of position, velocity (rate of change of position), acceleration (rate of change of velocity), and perhaps the third derivative of position with respect to time. Except that it turns out that the relevant laws mention only position, velocity and acceleration; the third derivative occurs in no laws (i.e. is not significant)27 and so is useless so far as the scientist, interested in stating only laws, is concerned. "Circumstances" may include, first, the spatial relations the object has to other objects (positions); second, the rates at which these relations are changing (vel- ocities); and third, the instantaneous states of all the objects involved. What is discovered is that acceleration is constantly conjoined to circumstances, and that velocity is not. This is the Law of Inertia. Thus at three feet above the earth, the velocity of one and the same object may be different according to the occasion. But the same object will always have the same acceleration in those circumstances, namely, thirty-two feet per second per second downward. Assume that all systems about which we are talking are closed. Assume also that 27 On the notion of significance and the importance of distinguishing it from other meanings of 'meaning', see Bergmann ([3], pp. 48-67) and Wilson ([33], Chapters 4 and 5) and also Wilson ([34] and [35]). 28 I assume none of these coefficients characterizing the instantaneous states of objects varies with time. However, classical mechanics can be generalized to include this idea. See footnote 44.</page><page sequence="3">402 FRED WILSON only the mentioned circumstances are relevant variables. With respect to any par- ticular system these will, of course, be inductive generalizations. This permits us to state the Law of Inertia thusly: In any system, the acceleration of an object at time t is afunction of (depends on) the circumstances in which it is found in the system at time t. This is the first axiom of classical mechanics. (The notion of "function" or "dependence" involved here is, of course, the completely unproblematic mathematical one. In particular, it in no way involves the anthropomorphic biologically grounded notion of function which often appears in Aristotelian con- texts.) Thus, if we know the circumstances and the law which relates circumstances of this kind to a particular acceleration, then one can deduce the acceleration. The details of these laws will depend on the particular systems one is investigating. They may involve only relative position at a distance (e.g. the solar system, a freely falling object) or they may involve the state of compression of objects in contact (e.g. the coming into contact of two billiard balls). The point is that, given the system, and the precise laws appropriate to that system, then one has the necessary and sufficient condition for any object to have any specified acceleration. Thus, if we know how the circumstances change over time, then one can use the laws appropriate to the system to deduce how the accelerations change over time. Conversely, suppose one knows all the laws for the system in question relating acceleration to circumstances. These will be a set of differential equations of the second order, acceleration being the second derivative with respect to time of the distance. If the standard kinematical assumptions with respect to the continuity and differentiability of the equations describing the changes in the circumstances are made, then the differential equations can be solved. One can deduce how the circumstances change over time, up to the constants of integration. Sufficient initial conditions will yield these. In short, the Law of Inertia, as an axiom, entails that the process law for any closed system in which the only relevant variables are the mentioned circumstances is a series of equations which are the solutions of a set of differential equations of the second order (cf. [3], p. 93; [23], p. 92; [27], pp. 21-22). The second axiom of classical mechanics is this:29 For any system containing two objects, x and y, the respective accelerations, a, and ay, will be such that a, = -kx,, x a, (where the minus sign indicates the accelerations are in opposite directions). This second law states what the same circumstances do to different bodies in those circumstances; and, in particular, it applies only to two body systems. It states, about the accelerations which any two bodies have as a result of their mutual interaction in a closed system of which they are the only relevant parts, that the ratio of these accelerations is a constant quantity (kx,y), whose value is independent of how exactly the interaction occurs. The exact value of the constant kxwy will depend on x and y; for any pair of bodies there will in general be a different acceleration ratio. The question next arises about how acceleration ratios might be related. This 29 For the second and third axioms, compare Symon ([27], pp. 5 ff).</page><page sequence="4">EXPLANATION IN ARISTOTLE, NEWTON, AND TOULMIN 403 question is answered by the third axiom of classical mechanics. This law states that: If, for any two-body system containing x and y, a, =-- k, x a, and if, for any two-body system containing x and z, a, - kx, x az, then, for any two-body system containing y and z, ky,-k xkx,.30 Thus, knowing sone acceleration ratios, we can use this third axiom (law) to deduce others. This third fundamental law of classical mechanics permits the introduction of the notion of 'mass.' That is, this word is stipulated to have a certain meaning; the concept thus defined is rendered significant, and therefore interesting to the scientist, by the second and third basic laws of classical mechanics. What one defines is mass ratios: 'm,!m,' is short for 'kx*'. From this definition and the second axiom (law) one can deduce that m/mx - -a,/ay. Indeed, this is but a definitional rewriting of that law. The same definition schema gives us m /in k,,z. If we divide the mass ratio ml/my by the ratio my/mX, we can deduce a value for the ratio mz/my. The third axiom (law) guarantees that this deduction yields the same result as the definition of the ratio as short for ky,z. The definitional schema determines only relative mass. To obtain absolute values one merely picks some (convenient) object and lets its mass have, by stipulation, the unit value. The third axiom guarantees that the ratio of masses will always be the negative inverse of ratio of accelerations in a two-body system, independently of the interactioins used to assign values to the masses of the objects, that is, in- dependently of the object chosen to be the unit mass. From the second and third axioms and the definition of mass one can now deduce the following true statement of law (call it the first derivative law): For any two-body system containing the objects x and y, and independently of the particular interactions used to determine the values of m., and my, m, x ax = --yn x ay. This first derivative law guarantees that the product of mass and acceleration is a significant concept. From this derivative law and the first axiom (the Law of Inertia) we can deduce that for two-body systems containing objects x and y, m. x a,x is a function of the circumstances in which x finds itself with respect to y. In particular, it is found that, for a great many systems, mxn x ax = F(mx, m., r.,,) where F is some function, and r7, is the distance from x to y.31 This, for ex- ample, is true for systems in which the mode of interaction is gravitational. In general, however, the function F may involve other coefficients of the individual objects besides mass, and may involve velocities as well as positions. The second and third axioms apply only to two-body systems. The theory of classical mechanics extends to systems with many bodies in them. These laws are derivable by virtue of a composition law. This composition law is the fourth axiom of classical mechanics. Conceptually divide any (closed) n-body system into all possible two-body systems. Assume certain laws for each such two-body system, and using these, calculate, for each object, x, the acceleration that it would have in each 30 This axiom is equivalent to the law that k,,z x ky, x kz X = 1, where the acceleration ratios are measured in two-body systems. Cf. Symon ([27], p. 6). 31 Strictly, we have to distinguish Fx and FB; all that is given here is Fx. But given Fx, the first derivative law enables us to immediately derive what we want to know about y without having to introduce Fy explicitly. So I ignore this point.</page><page sequence="5">404 FRED WILSON of the two-body systems. Then the acceleration a, in the n-body system is the vector sum of these accelerations in the conceptually distinguished two-body systems. The fourth axiom states that one can always find laws for the conceptually distinguished two-body systems such that the deduction of the law for the n-body system can be made.32 The concept of the "total force acting on an object x" is defined as follows: 'The total force acting on an object x' is short for 'm, x a,', where m, is the mass of x and a, is the acceleration of X.33 Let us use the abbreviation !f ' for this con- cept. In the case of two-body systems, as noted just above, we will have, in many cases, fx= F(mX, my, rx,y) And, from the first derivative law we obtain for two-body systems thatf, =f -fy However, the notion of total force as just defined is general, and applies to objects in systems of any number, n, of bodies. From the definition of total force and the Law of Inertia, it follows immediately that, in an n-body system, fx = Fx(mli . . ., Mn, ri,2i . . . ..is * * rn,fi .. *) Fx can be called the force function forfx. Three comments are relevant. One. The stated functional dependence, Fx, offx on the circumstances is in fact just a special case. However, it is an important special case, and all the logical points that have to be made can be made using a particular example with no loss. So the fact that it is just a special case need not worry us. Two. The function Fx must be labeled with an 'x' because in general the total force, fy, acting on y will be some other (though 32 Cf. Russell ([25], section 458). Note that it is necessary to assume that the mass of an object as measured in a two-body system does not change when the same body becomes, or is assumed to be, part of (say) a three-body system, in which, indeed, there may be other forces acting than those mentioned in the two-body system with which one has begun. This is part of the composition law. Mach ([19], p. 303) is explicitly conscious of this as a law crucial for justifying as significant his definition of 'mass'. He lists it as "Experimental Proposition" (c): "The mass-ratios of bodies are independent of the character of the physical states (of the bodies) that condition the mutual accelerations produced, be those states electrical, magnetic, or what not; and they remain, moreover, the same, whether they are mediately or immediately arrived at." The importance of this law in deflecting certain criticisms of Mach's definition of 'mass' has been pointed out recently in an excellent paper by Koslow ([17], pp. 226-227). Koslow quite correctly places Mach squarely in that tradition (of Newton and Euler) which treats mechanics as a causal, physical, science, in which the numbers which are the mass coefficients of bodies are taken to reflect certain important properties of their causal inter- actions. The contrast is to that tradition, the analytic tradition (of Lagrange and Laplace), which treats the mass of a body merely as a numerical coefficient in a group of interrelated mathematical equations. (The traditions cannot be absolutely distinguished, of course. The analytic mechanicians must eventually let their tlheory be put into practice, and offer an opera- tional definition of 'mass', in which case something very like the Machian definition will have to emerge. Similarly, there is no need for the causal mechanicians to ignore the mathematics of the analytic tradition, as, indeed, they did not.) Poincare ([23], pp. 97-105) directs some important criticisms at the Machian definition from the viewpoint of one more or less in the analytic tradition, but it is not possible to discuss them in this context. 33 More accurately, it is a definite description, but this sublety can be ignored for what we are about. (Though it cannot always be ignored. See Wilson [33], especially the comments on Hempel in Chapter 4, section (4.2); and Wilson [35].)</page><page sequence="6">EXPLANATION IN ARISTOTLE, NEWTON, AND TOULMIN 405 related) function, F, of the circumstances. Three. The relevant circumstances on whichf, depends are the masses of each of the n objects and the spatial relations between them all. In order to obtain values for the constants of integration one thus needs in the initial conditions, masses, (relative) positions and (relative) velocities of each object. No generality will be lost if we speak about object 1 in the n-body system rather than object x. It will simplify the notation in what follows. Axiom four states that the n-body system can always be conceptually decomposed into a set of two-body systems in such a way that the laws of the n-body system can be deduced from suitably assumed laws of the two-body systems. We can define the notion of a 'component acceleration of a,' as follows: 'ai,,, the ith component of the acceleration of a,' is short for 'a1,i is the acceleration object I would have in the two-body system consisting of it and object i of the n-body system standing in that spatial relation in which 1 and i stand in the n-body system.' Then a, is the vector sum of al,2, al,3, ... , al,n. It is, of course, axiom four which renders the con- cept of a component of an object's acceleration a significant concept.34 The total force, fl, acting on object 1 thus equals the product of ml and the vector sum of al,2, . ., a1,, (cf. [22], pp. 33 ff.). In order to perform the deduction it is necessary to have the special laws for the two-body systems which determine the component accelerations; these are neces- sary premisses for the deduction of the special law giving the dependence off1 on the circumstances in which object 1 finds itself in the n-body system. These special laws can be stated in terms of the dependeilce of the product of mass and component acceleration on the circumstances in the conceptually distinguished two-body system. That is, one can define 'the force, fi , exerted by object i on object 1' ("the ith component force") as short for 'ml x aL,i'. The fourth axiom tells us to use the laws about two-body systems with respect to the conceptually distinguished two- body systems that we are now dealing with. Thus, both axioms two and three apply to these systems. Furthermore, the first derivative law will also apply to these systems, so that we can immediately derive thatfi, =-,i for each of the con- ceptually distinguished two-body systems. This does not suffice, however. We need special laws for each of the conceptually distinguished systems. These laws can be stated by giving a force function for each of the systems. We state for each system a law which it would conform to if it were isolated. This law can be put in the form f1,i -b ,j(m1, mi, r1,i).35 Then, knowing the details of the n-body system, we can use these and the force function 01,i to derive fi,i, for each i = 2, . . ., n.36 That enables us to obtain ali for each i. Taking the vector sum of these accelerations finally gives us a1. That is, the functional dependence, F1, of fi on the circumstances of the n-body system can be deduced 34 There are infinitely many vector decompositions of a,. But only one of these decompositions into component accelerations is significant. That is, only one among the infinite number of decompositions is important in the deductive theoretical structure of classical mechanics. 35 Using this and the first derivative law for two-body systems, we can derive immediately the value of f,1. 36 Using the knowledge derived in the fashion of footnote 34, we can now go on to deduce A , fi .' f t</page><page sequence="7">406 FRED WILSON using axiom four, the various definitions, and assuming a force function 01,i, for each i = 2,..., n; and, indeed, we are able to obtainfi as some function, Fi, of the circumstances for each object i in the n-body system.37 If we have the O's, the F's follow. It should be pointed out that the O6's need not all be the same sort of function. For example, it may be that for all the two-body systems save one the appropriate force function is the gravitational, while in the remaining system the two objects are joined by a spring in which case the force function would be radically different.38 Newton's name is attached to his discovery that for a great many systems, the appropriate force function is the gravitational: in a two-body system containing objects x and y, the total force on x in the circumstances is this, F = G x mX x M,lr2 where G is the gravitational constant. From this and the first derivative law one can deduce F, It was also found by Newton that the same force function applied to the conceptually distinguished systems noted by axiom four for n-body systems; that is, he discovered that for a great many systems, it suffices to let OjXb = G x mn x m,lr2v for all x and y in the n-body system. Such a system is the solar system.89 To state a force function is to state a large number of laws connecting accelera- tions to circumstances. It is to state such a law for two-body systems. And it is also, by virtue of axiom four, to state premisses which will permit the deduction of 37 See footnote 35. 38 Another important derivative law is the one which states the familiar properties of the centre of mass of systems. This law follows from the four axioms; cf. Russell ([25], pp. 484-485). Russell points out that but for the fourth axiom area enclosed as well as distance might be a relevant variable in the three-body system, volume in the four-body system, and so on. If that were so, we would not have the usual properties for the centre of mass. Another important law which follows from the axioms is that mass is an additive scalar con- stant. Cf. Broad ([51, pp. 168 ff). Indeed, it follows from axioms two and three that the mass. functor satisfies all those axioms which must be satisfied if a ratio scale for mass is to be possible. An assumption which is usually made in classical mechanics is that the mass of an object remains constant, that is, that dm/dt = 0. For large numbers of systems (e.g. the solar system, falling bodies, objects on ice) this assumption is true. Cf. Bergmann ([3], p. 99). Systems for which dm/dt = 0 does not hold can be reduced to the case in which it does if one introduces those hypotheses which constitute the (classical) theory of the structure of matter. But to go into this would take us far too far afield. Cf. Bergmann ([3], pp. 90-91). 39 Cohen [11] suggests (p. 174) that Newton's great achievement was the inductive leap through which Newton supposed the gravitational force function applies to great numbers of systems beyond the solar system. I must demur on this point. From Kepler's second law, it follows that the planet is accelerating toward the sun and that the force function involves the vector from the sun to the planet. Cf. Cohen ([11], p. 166). From Kepler's first law it follows that the force is the inverse square of the distance from the sun to the planet. Cf. Cohen ([11], p. 169). From Kepler's third law it follows that the force function involves the product of the masses. Cf. Cohen ([1l1], p. 173). Given Kepler's laws, in other words, one already has implicitly the law of gravitation (cf. Symon ([27], section 3.15)) -except, of course, for the inductive leap. The imaginative inductive leap is to be respected, but it was the making explicit what was only implicit in Kepler's laws that constitutes the great achievement of Newton. The tools needed for this were three. First, one needed a general definition of acceleration. For this, Newton had to invent the calculus. Second, one needed a definition of mass. Third, one needed a definition of force. It was Newton's genius to provide the definitions required. After the definitions were available (and the mathematical apparatus which made them pos- sible), the discovery of the law of gravitation was relatively easy.</page><page sequence="8">EXPLANATION IN ARISTOTLE, NEWTON, AND TOULMIN 407 such laws for n-body systems. Finally, if we know the force function for each mo- ment in a system, then we have a process law for the system. In a great many sys- tems, the force function does not change over time; such a system is one in which there are none but gravitational forces. This is the logical structure of classical mechanics considered as a theory. I have gone into it not merely to locate the position of that axiom which is known as the Law of Inertia. I have gone into it also to analyze the notion of force as it appears in classical mechanics. There is nothing anthropomorphic about the notion.40 The notion of force as it appears in classical mechanics has nothing to do with the notion of force ("striving") as it appears in the Aristotelian patterns of explanation. Nor is the notion in classical mechanics in any way connected with the idea of a Nature (set of desires) as it is in the Aristotelian patterns. To point out that the total force f- acting on a body is equal to m, x ax is to explain nothing. For the proposition is true by definition of the concept of total force. On the other hand, to point to a force function, Fx, stating the dependence of fx on the circumstances, is to explain much, since to state a force function is to state a great many laws, including process laws, for both two- and (by virtue of axiom four) n-body systems. On the other hand, it is quite possible for people to illegitimately import Aristote- lian ideas into the concepts of classical mechanics. In such a case, m, x a, would appear to be illuminating. It provides a nmeasure of the Aristotelian strivings. To say that the total force is always equal to m, x ax becomes the statement that the Aristotelian forces, both external and internal, always so strive that this result comes about. Although the forms which the strivings take may vary from system to system, they all have this in common, that they always conspire to bring about this result. This is obviously much more impressive than what is permitted by classical mechanics alone, namely, the mere statement that, by virtue of the first derivative law, the concept mx x ax is a significant concept. Moreover, axiom four enables us to locate exactly all the external Aristotelian strivings. Axiom four permits one to introduce the notion of component forces, fi,j. Each of these will be looked upon as an Aristotelian striving. Each object i surrounding object 1 will strive, and they will always conspire together in such a way that whatever mass object 1 has, their combined result will be measured by ml x a,. Each of these Aristotelian forces will be external. The only case where these forces are not acting will be the case where al = 0. That is, only in this case will it not be required to appeal to externalforces. Thus, where a, # 0 the Aristotelian process or state is Unnatural; the only Natural state or process will be the case that a, = 0. This, of course, only makes sense if you look at classical mechanics through Aristotelian spectacles, interpreting al = 0 as marking the absence of Aristotelian strivings, and a, # 0 as marking the presence of such strivings. There is nothing in classical mechanics itself to warrant so speaking. Within the logical structure of classical mechanics there is nothing to mark off a, = 0 from (say) a, = 9; they are both simply accelerations which are lawfully connected to circumstances. 40 This is emphasized by Clifford [9], Russell [25], and Mach [19].</page><page sequence="9">408 FRED WILSON Axiom four locates the external Aristotelian forces. What of the internal forces which the external objects strive to overcome? Are there any such strivings? Consider an n-body system. Suppose that object 1 has mass ml. In these circum- stances, the object will have acceleration a,. Suppose, now, that everything is unchanged save that object 1 is changed to object 1V with mass min. Suppose ml &lt; ml*. In that case, we will have the acceleration a, &gt; a,.. If, on the other hand, ml &gt; ml., we will have a, &lt; al, i.e. the greater the mass, the less the acceleration; or, in Aristotelian terms, the mass of an object measures the degree to which it is striving to not accelerate. But before pursuing further what classical mechanics looks like through Aris- totelian spectacles, it is necessary to examine the other role played by the Law of Inertia, namely, as a piece of imperfect knowledge. In some many-body systems as they change over time the motions of the objects involved are such that one or more of those objects has zero acceleration, i.e. has constant velocity. For example, the case of an object moving across a very smooth surface approximates to this. Another example is the case of a lever in equilibrium. Such a case might well be explained by appeal to the generality (I): "Whenever the total force on an object is zero, then the acceleration is zero" and the assumption that the total force acting on the object is zero. The generality here appealed to is the Law of Inertia in its role as a piece of imperfect knowledge about how certain objects behave in certain circulmstances. It is not functioning as an axiom of a theory, explaining other laws. Rather it is functioning as a law to explain the behavior of individual objects. As such, it is, it is clear, not a process law, and embodies, therefore, a piece of imperfect knowledge. Yet, if not perfect, it is still knowledge and is still appropriate as a premiss in a scientific explanation. Taken literally, (I) is, of course, trivially true. By virtue of the very definition of 'total force acting on an object' a sufficient condition for that force being zero is that the acceleration is zero! This shows that 'total force' in (I) has additional connotations. The total force, f acting on an object x is a certain function, F, of the circumstances. The point of (I) is to state that the force function, F, other- wise unspecified, and the circumstances, also otherwise unspecified, are such that the total force fx, and hence the acceleration ax, is zero. (I) is expressed as it is to mark the ignorance of the relevant variables in the situation and the ignorance of the way these variables interact in determining the zero acceleration. Which is simply to say that (I) is expressed as it is because it is a piece of imperfect knowledge. Implicit in (I) is a reference to axioms two, three, and four. This distinguishes this version of the Law of Inertia from the Law of Inertia stated as axiom one of classical mechanics. It is this implicit reference to axioms two, three and four that makes possible the appearance of 'force' in (I). This word becomes significant only after the concept of mass is introduced, which is to say, only after axiom two is stated, and only after mass ratios are found to be independent of the mode of interaction, which is to say, only after axiom three is stated. Moreover, there is in (I) the idea that there are component forces, and that, when these as it were cancel each other out, acceleration is zero; or, in other words, there is an implicit reference to axiom four also. But of this last, more in a moment. The present point is simply that there</page><page sequence="10">EXPLANATION IN ARISTOTLE, NEWTON, AND TOULMIN 409 is no reference to any of the other axioms to be found in axiom one. It merely states that acceleration is uniformly connected to circumstances, leaving open the form which this dependence might take. We thus come to distinguish the Law of Inertia stated as axiom one from the Law of Intertia in its role as a piece of imper- fect knowledge, (I), telling us something, though not everything, about how ac- celeration depends on circumstances. It is worth pointing out that the case of an isolated body, that is, of a closed one- body system, is but a special case of (I). The law for a one-body system simply says that for an isolated body, whenever the total force is zero, then the acceleration is zero, i.e. velocity is constant.41 Call this (1*). The clause about isolation guarantees that the relevant circumstances will simply be the instantaneous states of the object itself. If we appeal to (1*) to explain the behavior of an isolated body we are appealing to a piece of imperfect knowledge, and not a tautology. The point of citing (1*) is to indicate, as was the point of citing (I), that in the system being talked about the force function, otherwise unspecified, and the circumstances, otherwise unspecified, are such that the total force and hence the acceleration are zero.42 That is, (1*) is expressed as it is to mark the failure to cite the relevant variables and the form in which the dependence occurs.43 In short, 41 Whether or not a system, any system, is closed, that is, whether or not any factors spatially external to the system are relevant to what occurs inside the system (cf. footnote 3), is a question of fact. To assert that a system is closed is to assert an inductive generalization. Cf. Bergmann ([31, p. 98). The assumption that the solar system is closed has been amply justified by the predictive success of this hypothesis. It follows, therefore, Hanson ([13], p. 112) notwithstanding, that one can quite intelligibly speak of the possibility of closed one-body systems, even though in order to speak intelligibly of the orbit of such a body one must introduce other bodies to provide the reference frame; all that is required is that the objects which provide the frame of reference be far enough away that within the limits of measurement and induction they do not interact with the object in the one-body system. An example would be any small object in intergalactic space. Cf. Broad ([5], pp. 104-113). 42 Hanson ([13], p. 111, footnote 6), suggests that the kinetic definition of mass in terms of acceleration ratios which was given above is not applicable to an object in a closed one-body system since there are by hypothesis no other objects for it to interact with. But this is just mistaken. To be sure, mass could not be measured in such a system. But the mass of the object could be measured in some (e.g.) two-body system, and then the second object could be removed to a distance sufficient (cf. footnote 41) that it no longer interacts with the first object. The first object will then be in a closed one-body system. By virtue of the law that mass is constant (cf. footnote 38) one can now deduce what the mass of the object in the one-body system is. 43 Of what sort might this dependence be? The total force f on the object x (f, = m, x a,) will be some function F, of properties of the object in question (since by hypothesis that is the only object which could provide the relevant variables). Usually in such a case the function FE will simply be zero; that is, f, = 0. Then acceleration will be zero and velocity constant. Here the process law is of the simplest sort, being the solution of the second order differential equation a, = 0. But this is not the only possibility. One might havef., = F.(e,) where e, is the coefficient of elasticity of x. Systems for which such a law holds are unknown. But axiom one, the Law of Inertia in its role as an axiom does not rule out the possibility. Nor does it rule out the following, less far fetched, possibility. Suppose there is a coefficient of x, c, that varies with time; c, =g(t). Then one could havefx = Fx(cx) = Fx(g(t)). Such a supposition could be used to explain the motion of a rocket accelerating by means of a chemical engine in intergalactic space. None of these possibilities has much place in classical mechanics, even though none of them are excluded by the axioms. We can therefore ignore them. See footnote 28. Hanson [13] ignores these also; he deals only with the case wheref, = 0, speaking of "iso- lated bodies" which are free of "external forces." However, he does not sharply distinguish 6-J.P.s.</page><page sequence="11">410 FRED WILSON like the more general (I), (1*) is not to be identified with the Law of Inertia as an axiom.44 It is a piece of imperfect knowledge, to be absorbed into perfect knowl- edge one might come to have of the systems whose behavior it is used to explain.45 This perfect knowledge is in turn part of a theory in which the Law of Inertia in its role as an axiom, takes its place as axiom one. Nor is it usually very difficult, thanks to Newton, to locate the perfect knowledge of which (I) is but a part. In the case of the lever, for example, it is possible to give a process law for the system. From this law one can deduce exactly what the circumstances must be like, and remain like, in order for the lever to continue to have zero acceleration. From the process law we can deduce all those details of which (1) leaves us ignorant. The imperfection of (I) finds its place in the perfection of the process law. On the other hand, we do not have a process law for all cases. That makes an appeal to (I) still appropriate. Moreover, it has a further appropriateness, when it is taken in conjunction with axiom four of classical mechanics. It is this further point which accounts for the appearance of 'total force' in (I), and its seemingly trivial formulation. Suppose that an object is not moving with zero acceleration. Then, using (I) one can deduce that the total force on the object is not zero. It follows that at least one component, acceleration, is not zero. That means we have to search for force functions for the conceptually distinguished two-body systems which state how the component accelerations depend on the circumstances and which will enable one to deduce which of the component acceleration(s) is (are) not equal to zero. this piece of perfect knowledge about certain one-body systems, from the piece of imperfect knowledge (It). He compares (p. 119) what he calls the Law of Inertia to Boyle's law on the one hand and to the Ideal Gas Law on the other. The former comparison gives him (1*) since Boyle's law is a piece of imperfect knowledge (it leaves out a relevant variable); the latter comparison gives him the case wheref, = 0, since the Ideal Gas Law omits (we know from the theory of which it is a part) no variables which would be relevant if there were any ideal gases, and would therefore constitute perfect knowledge of any system to which it applied. See also footnote 44. Axiom one (the Law of Inertia in its role as an axiom) is, it is clear, to be distinguished from this law (f, = 0) about certain one-body systems. The former is quite compatible withft # 0 for one-body systems, as our discussion just above established. One might note that in any case where the total force and so the acceleration is some function other than the zero function of properties of the object itself, one could reasonably speak of 4"self-movers." But such a notion of "self-movement" would not be anthropomorphic in the sense in which the Aristotelian notion is anthropomorphic. The rocket ship examlple makes this clear. 44 Nor, of course is (1*) to be identified with (I). (1*) is a special case of (I), applying to only one-body systems, whereas the imperfect knowledge embodied in (I) applies to systems with any number of bodies. Hanson [131 blurs (I) and (1P). His discussion is in part about the laws which apply to isolated systems for which (1*) is appropriate (cf. p. 111), but on the other hand introduces (cf. p. 108) the example of a hard sphere rolling down the plane and onto a smooth horizontal plane. For the latter, only (I) could be appropriate, since a sphere on a plane is (at best) a three- body (incline and plane, earth, sphere) system (though it could well be one in which the total force on the sphere is as a matter of fact zero). In this interesting paper Hanson also tends to blur (I) with the Law of Inertia in its role as an axiom (cf. p. 119). 45 It is absorbed into such pieces of perfect knowledge as were indicated in footnote 43.</page><page sequence="12">EXPLANATION IN ARISTOTLE, NEWTON, AND TOULMIN 411 Axiom four states that such force functions can always be found.46 Having these force functions one can obtain the process law for the complete system and explain why the object has the acceleration it has rather than zero acceleration; that is, it is possible to explain the "violation" of (I). Axiom four states that any "violation" of (I) can be explained by locating a "hidden mechanism." This "hidden mechanism" will involve one of the bodies in the system exerting a force on the object "violating" (I). This force will be nonzero. Force functions can be found for this force, and for the rest of the components (those which take on the value zero), such that the law accounting for the "violation" can be deduced.47 Nor is the case where the acceleration is zero anything but a special case of this. It is just that, in this case, the force functions will be such that the component accelerations they determine will have the vector sum of zero. In the case that (I) is not "violated" the "hidden mechanisms" will conspire together to produce the result of zero acceleration in the circumstances. In the case that (I) is "violated" the "hidden mechanisms" will always involve at least one nonzero component force. It is this getting down to the "hidden mechanisms" which axiom four says are there that provides the rationale behind the occurrence 'total force is zero' in the antecedent of (I). What must be emphasized is that the presence of "hidden mechan- isms" determining whether or not (I) is "violated" is something which follows from axiomfour.48 I just said that the case where the acceleration is zero, that is, the case where (I) is not "violated," is but a special case, on equal standing with the case where (I) is "violated." However, this would not appear to be so if one were to look at the matter through Aristotelian spectacles. In the case that (I) is not "violated" by an object the various other objects in the system are striving that the external Aris- totelian forces which they exert on the first object conspire to produce the result of zero acceleration. In this case it may indeed be that there are no such forces at all. But in the case that (I) is "violated" we know definitely that there is present 46 Under the assumption, of course, that a process law for the system does in fact exist. 47 This is not Leverrier's move. Hanson ([14], p. 96 and footnote 2 to that page as found on p. 203), suggests otherwise, but such a suggestion is wrong. The point which was just made was that force functions otherwise unspecified can as a matter of fact always be found. Leverrier on the other hand assumed a specific and determinate force function, namely, the gravitational. The failure of his predictions with respect to Uranus led him to reject one of his premises as false. It was not the premise stating the force function for all relevant two-body systems which he rejected, but rather the premise that all relevant two-body systems were taken into account, i.e. the premise that the system with which he was dealing was closed. He retained the force function as applying to all conceptually distinguishable two-body systems, and assumed closure was violated, that the system was not an eight-body, but rather a nine-body system. Using the gravitational force function for all possible two-body systems in the nine-body system, he deduced (approximated as closely as he wanted to) the process law for the supposed nine-body system. He then assumed the nine-body system was closed. Then taking observational data as initial conditions he was able to deduce the location of the ninth object. An observational check verified this, which in turn confirmed his assumptions. (As we know now, the assumption of closure was still false; there was a tenth body to be taken into account.) The point is that the law I have called axiom four enables us to deduce the existence of force functions ("hidden mechanism"). Leverrier assumed the force function, abandoned the assump- tion of closure, and deduced the process law for a closed nine-body system. 48 See also footnote 52.</page><page sequence="13">412 FRED WILSON at least one Aristotelian external force (this is what a nonzero component becomes), and that it is the presence of this force which accounts for the violation of (I). In the case that (I) is not "violated" by an object, the external Aristotelian forces exactly balance each other, conspiring together to give the result of a total external force of zero; which means, on the Aristotelian patterns, that the object will continue to stay in a Natural state or Aristotelian process.49 In the case that (1) is "violated" by an object, then there is at least one relevant external force ("hidden mechanism") appeal to which explains the state or Aristotelian process the object is in; which means, on the Aristotelian patterns, that the state or process is Un- natural, since it is Unnatural states and processes which are explained by the actionk of unbalanced (nonzero) external forces. Thus, when the matter is looked at through the Aristotelian spectacles, one seems to have a radical difference between the case where (I) is not, and the case where (I) is violated; in the former we have the object in a Natural state; in the latter we have the object in an Unnatural state or Aristotelian process. Once one starts looking at matters in this way one soon loses the distinction between the Law of Inertia as an axiom of a theory used to explain laws, and the Law of Inertia (i.e. (I)) as a piece of imperfect knowledge used in the absence of perfect (process) knowledge to explain the behavior of individual objects. The blur occurs via the Aristotelian notion of 'Nature'. One: An Aristotelian Nature determines the kind of external forces which are and are not relevant to effecting changes in an object. For, the Nature of an object is what it desires to be and to not be; these desires determine how the object will strive; it will strive after certain ends determined by its Nature; external forces must overcome these internal strivings if the object is to come to be or to not be what is contrary to what it Naturally desires. Now, the Law of Inertia, in its role as the first axiom of mechanics, asserts that it is acceleration which is regularly connected to circumstances; if the (relevant) circumstances are repeated then the acceleration of the object in those circumstances will be the same. It states that circumstances determine accelerations; that means, in terms of the Aristotelian patterns, that what the external circumstances affect, i.e. what the external forces affect, is the acceleration of the object.50 Thus, the Law of Inertia, in its role as an axiom, states something about the Natures of the objects dealt with in classical mechanics: it states that their Natures are such that they strive to not accelerate, that what the appeal to external forces explains is accelerations. At least, this is what the axiom does if it is looked at through Aristotelian spectacles. In and of itself, it has nothing to do with Aristotelian Natures. For, these have no place in classical mechanics. Two: The Aristotelian Nature is also appealed to when explanations of the behavior of individual objects are given. It is appealed to in order to explain the behavior of an object in those circumstances in which the external forces are 49 However, if this is pursued far enough, it will turn out that the category of Natural Aristotelian processes will be empty. See below. 50 The resistance to be overcome is measured by the mass of the object. The Law of Inertia thus corresponds to a generic characteristic, of which the various masses are species.</page><page sequence="14">EXPLANATION IN ARISTOTLE, NEWTON, AND TOULMIN 413 absent or cancel each other out. By virtue of its Nature, the object behaves in cer- tain regular ways in "normal conditions"; more precisely, its Nature (desires) determine that it will so strive that certain regularities are true. But these regularities are pieces of imperfect knowledge. Such a regularity is (I), the Law of Inertia in its role as a piece of imperfect knowledge, cited to explain the behavior of objects in statical and certain simple dynamical situations. Thus, if one looks at classical mechanics through Aristotelian spectacles, interpreting it in terms of the Aristotelian patterns of explanation, then one will be led, via the Aristotelian notion of 'Nature', to obscure the distinction between, on the one hand, the Law of Inertia in its role as an axiom, appealed to in the explanation of laws, and, on the other hand, the Law of Inertia in its role as a piece of imperfect knowledge, appealed to in the explanation of the behavior of individual objects. If, therefore, a writer does obscure this distinction, then it is at least prima facie evidence that he is trying to revive the Aristotelian patterns of explana- tion. Such prima facie evidence can be found in Hanson, for example. Hanson tells us that "Latter-day Newtonians regarded dynamical law statements as needing no explanation whatever.. ."([14], p. 95). This could not mean that no laws required explanation, for everyone has been quite willing to say that the law which accounts for the behavior of the solar system is explained by theory provided by classical mechanics. What needed no explanation were the basic laws (axioms) of the theory. That is, assuming the four axioms and the gravitational force function, the other laws were explained. But precisely because these were the premisses from which the theoretical explanations of the laws all began, and because there was no other more basic theory, these laws themselves were not explained; and, indeed, in terms of what was then known, these laws needed no further explanation, in the sense that there was no reason to believe that there was some more basic theory from which they could be derived and in terms of which they could be explained. However, the main point is that the reference of Hanson's is clearly to axioms. For, everyone held that some dynamical laws could be explained by means of derivation from certain axioms. This being so, we now note that Hanson continues with: Apparently a statement of the first law needs no explanation because it could not be false; yet it tells us what happens in nature, or what would happen if certain conditions were realized. Thus the empirical grounds for asserting the first law are events [sequences of events?] like slipping on polished floors ... When the first law statement seems not to hold, the reason [hidden mechanism, as he later calls it] ([14], p. 96) can always be found ... The law encapsulates and extrapolates much information about events, yet it seems beyond disconfirmation: it could not but be true ([14], pp. 95-96). The shift to talk about (I), the Law of Inertia in its role as a piece of imperfect knowledge used to explain, not laws, but behavior of individual objects in "stan- dard conditions," is patent. Yet Hanson makes no effort to distinguish the two roles. This, as was said, is prima facie evidence that he is reviving the Aristotelian patterns of thought. This evidence is reinforced when one looks more specifically at what Hanson says about the Law. It is a statement about what occurs, as a matter of fact; but it is</page><page sequence="15">414 RD WILSON beyond disconfirmation, since "violations" are always "explained away" by appeal to a "hidden mechanism." In other words, Hanson is stating that the role played by the Law of Inertia is precisely that role which, in the Aristotelian patterns, is played by those rules which state what objects do Naturally; they state what objects do in fact do, and if the object is not behaving in accordance with them (i.e. is behaving Unnaturally) then this deviation from the rule is always to be explained by appeal to an external Aristotelian force. If the goal is not achieved, if, in other words, there is a deviation from the rule, then a mechanism must be found. This is the very pattern of Aristotelian explanations. We know, however, that there is no justification within classical mechanics for so treating the Law of Inertia. Insofar as Hanson argues, the argument is specious. Hanson presents the possibility of "hidden mechanisms" as having something to do with the status of the Law of Inertia. But this is not so, as we saw. The possibility of discovering a "hidden mechanism" to account for any deviation from (I) is some- thing which is entailed by the fourth axiom of classical mechanics.5' The role of the fourth axiom is crucial; its role is ignored by Hanson; its role renders what he says specious. It is specious because this crucial fourth axiom has no status other than that of a law; and so the statement one can always find a "hidden mechanism" has no status other than that of an empirical generalization.52 It has nothing to 51 Cf. footnote 46. 52 I have taken Hanson to be talking about (I). The following reason justifies this. He men- tions ([14], p. 96) possible "mechanisms" which enable one to explain "violations" of the Law of Inertia. Among these are magnetic forces (e.g. lodestones) and frictional forces (e.g. ground glass on ice). That is, Hanson indicates certain forces which act on objects within the system. This indicates he is talking about (I) and "violations" of (I) which are explained by means of the mechanisms which axiom four says can always be found (assuming that a process for the system does in fact exist). Because the mechanisms are all located within the system, I take it that primarily he is not talking about violations of closure. On the other hand, there is also his reference to Leverrier (see footnote 47), where the reference could only be to explaining "violations" in terms of the breakage of closure, i.e. in terms of the falsity of the closure assumption. So he is at least secondarily referring to closure violations. Take an area of space and the objects in it. If the acceleration of one of these objects does not depend on the circumstances within that area, then by axiom one we can deduce that it is not a closed system. For, axiom one, the Law of Inertia in its role as an axiom, states that if a system is closed then accelerations depend on circumstances within the system. Thus, if the "violations" are to be explained in terms of breakages of closure, then Hanson is referring to the Law of Inertia in its role as an axiom rather than to (I). On the other hand this will in no way support Hanson's suggestion that the Law of Inertia has a status in any way different from that of any other factual claim. He contrasts (see [14], pp. 95-96) "information about events" and "beyond disconfirmation"; and if it is beyond disconfirmation then "it could not but be true," i.e. it is analytically true. The argument has the conclusion that the Law of Inertia is analytically true. This conclusion does not follow from the above considerations concerning axiom one and violations of closure. To be sure, the conclusion drawn from axiom one whenever acceleration does not depend on circumstances within the system (viz. that the system is not closed) is not falsifiable; that is, the claim that the appropriate "mechanism" can be found is not a falsifiable claim. But this is only because it is existential: it states that there is an object such that it provides (values of) variables relevant to what goes on inside the system. And existential claims are certainly not analytically true. Hence the argument from the possibility of always finding hidden mechanisms (closure violations) to the claim that the Law of Inertia (in its role as an axiom) is analytically true, is an invalid argument.</page><page sequence="16">EXPLANATION IN ARISTOTLE, NEWTON, AND TOULMIN 415 do with the pattern of scientific explanation of individual facts. By ignoring axiom four Hanson is able to make it look as if explanations in classical mechanics fall into the Aristotelian pattern.53 Moreover, as was also noted, there is no special difference as far as classical mechanics is concerned between the case where an object in a many-body system "conforms" to (I) and a case where it "violates" (I). In the former, as well as in the latter, there are "hidden mechanisms" present; only, they produce zero acceleration in the former case, nonzero acceleration in the latter. The appearance of an important difference only arises if classical mechanics is viewed through Aristotelian spectacles. This, I suggest, is what Hanson does. Looking at the Law of Inertia through Aristotelian spectacles is justified by nothing in the logical structure of either science itself or of classical mechanics in particular. And to say that Newton looked at it in this fashion is to point out the simple fact that Newton was confused about the logical structure of classical mechanics. Historically, this is quite understandable, but neither its being Newton's confusion nor its being historically understandable makes it any the less a con- fusion. However, the Law of Inertia, looked at in Aristotelian terms, played an important structural role in the final triumph of the scientific over the Aristotelian patterns of explanation. It is not merely that the new science grew up with the heritage of Aristotle and only gradually overthrew that heritage, being for a time as it were half-way in between. Rather, the Law of Inertia, when put into Aristotelian garb, structurally forces one to re-evaluate the Aristotelian patterns. When the new science began to emerge, the Law of Inertia was gradually formulated. It had the dual status of an implicit axiom and a piece of imperfect knowledge. These two were blurred via the Aristotelian notion of Nature. This forces one to speak in certain ways about internal and external forces. This we have seen. The point is that when one speaks this way about Aristotelian strivings, the whole idea that there are anthropomorphic strivings involved becomes structurally implausible. If the Law of Inertia is taken to be a statement about the Aristotelian Natures of objects, then what it says is this, that the object desires to be such that its ac- celeration a, = 0, and desires not to be such that a, =A 0. When an object is what it desires to be, and is not what it desires to not be, then it is in its Natural state. Hence, when a, = 0, the object is in its Natural state. When an object is not what it desires to be and is what it desires to not be, then the object is not in a Natural state; in such a case, either it is undergoing a Natural process, or it is in an Un- natural state, or it is undergoing an Unnatural process, these being the remaining alternatives. Hence, if the object x is such that a, # 0, then either it is undergoing a Natural process or an Unnatural process, or is in an Unnatural state. Now, any Natural process is explained, on the Aristotelian patterns, by pointing to internal forces which overcome external resistances. But according to the Aristotelianized 53 Hanson further confuses the issue by pointing out that the axioms of dynamics have the status of what I have elsewhere called "paradigm rules" (Wilson [33], Chapter 5) and suggesting (wrongly) that this is a logical characteristic of them. To unpack this further point would carry us too far afield, however.</page><page sequence="17">416 FRED WILSON classical mechanics, any nonzero acceleration is to be accounted for in terms of external forces. It follows that, there are no Natural processes. Joining classical mechanics and the Aristotelian patterns of explanation immediately forces one to declare that one of the major categories of the latter, viz. that of Natural Aris- totelian processes, is empty. This by itself is bound to be fishy. But more importantly, it in a way kills an important anthropomorphic feature of the Aristotelian patterns. To be sure, forces are still strivings, whether they be external forces or internal (inertial) forces. But the only role that remains for the internal forces is that of resisting external forces and of keeping the object in its Natural state. Internalforces now initiate no change. This is merely another way of saying that there are no Natural processes. But putting it this way shows how far the anthropomorphic models on which the Aris- totelian patterns rely are being departed from. The model is that of a person raising his arm. When a person wants to raise his arm, and he tries to do so, then (assuming there are no external forces he is unable to overcome) his arm rises; the person initiated the change by his strivings. It is characteristic of the model that changers are self-movers. The Law of Inertia destroys the idea that objects are self- movers. After this goes, it is not surprising to find the rest of the anthropomorphic dross fast disappearing (among physicists).54 Moreover, external forces start to become very fishy things also. Objects are not self-movers; they are inert resisters of external forces. These external forces are, however, internal to other objects. An object no longer moves itself, but it does continue to move other things; initiating no changes in itself, it nonetheless initiates them in other objects. Indeed, by the first derivative law, and the fourth axiom, it exerts a force on every other object to precisely the extent that the other object exerts a force on it. And to what end, one must ask, are these Unnatural states or processes directed? What do the inert movers desire to be or become when they move these other objects? These questions receive no answer within the context of the Aristotelianized classical mechanics. Another more specific point can be mentioned here. As mechanics developed it became clear that many of the more important force functions, including the gravitational, involve no contact. Classical mechanics requires action at a distance. The anthropomorphic models behind the Aristotelian patterns of explanation structurally determine, as we saw above, that all external forces operate by contact. The attempt to interpret some of the specific applications of classical mechanics, 64 One may, of course, still say that there are Aristotelian self-movers at "higher" levels, e.g. at the level of the organic. And indeed this is exactly what people did until Darwin killed the notion (except for such bearers of cultural lag as Bergson and other assorted Hegelians). Toulmin of course misunderstands this. He points out that for seventeenth century chemists there was a distinction between the inanimate and the animate (Toulmin [28], p. 78). We no longer make this distinction: organisms are but molecules of extreme complexity. He suggests we might reverse this and say that molecules are organisms of extreme simplicity. Which is true but pointless, for it fails to recognize that for the seventeenth century, the animate was the realm for which Aristotelian explanations were appropriate, scientific explanations inappropriate. What Toulmin says implies that Aristotelian explanations are now found to be appropriate for molecules, whereas the point behind holding that organisms are but complex molecules is that Aristotelian explanations are inappropriate in both realms!</page><page sequence="18">EXPLANATION IN ARISTOTLE, NEWTON, AND TOULMIN 417 some of the particular force functions such as the gravitational, along Aristotelian lines leads to a structurally incoherent result: gravitation does not involve contact, and that is all there is to it. For a while there was worry about action at a distance. As the nature of Newton's triumph became clear, as the perfection of the process knowledge which Newton presented to the world became evident, such worries disappeared. Once it was realized that the explanatory power came via the laws Newton discovered, and that the notion of a law did not essentially involve the idea of contact (or of volition, for that matter), it was not for long in doubt whether action at a distance or the Aristotelian patterns would be the one to go in efforts to remove the structural defect arising from their combination. There is, so far as I can see, but one way in which the difficulty could be resolved while retaining both the observationally justified laws about action at a distance and the Aristotelian requirement that external forces act by contact. This is by framing "hypotheses." The problem can be overcome if one supposes that gravita- tion acting at a distance is but an appearance, that behind this appearance there are but chance collisions of inert pieces of matter, that space is completely filled by these pieces of matter, and that it is by virtue of the collisions of insensible particles that the appearance of action at a distance arises55-if one forms these "mechanical hypotheses," then one can avoid the objection based on gravitational forces. But if such a way of saving the position is open to the metaphysician,56 it is hardly open to the scientist, who, by definition introduces no hypothesis unless there is observational warrant. This was seen clearly by Newton: "Hypotheses non fingo." However, even if, following such a one as Descartes, we introduce "hypotheses," we still have the problem raised above about external forces even at the level of the hypothesized invisible billiard balls: what do the inert movers, the exerters of the external forces, desire to be or become when they move the other objects but not themselves? A possible way out of this problem is to try to interpret all changes as occurring by chance. Object x resists (nonzero) acceleration. It therefore moves in a straight line. Object y also resists (nonzero) acceleration and also moves in a straight line. Suppose these straight lines intersect. Then x and y will collide. The collision was desired by neither. So, the result of it, namely, the (nonzero) accelera- tion of both x and y, is a matter of chance.57 If this would wash, then the question raised above, about the state x desires to be in when it moves (accelerates) y, will not arise. For, if the change is a matter of chance, in the Aristotelian sense, then issues about what the changers might have desired simply do not arise; otherwise, it would not be a case of chance. But, as a matter of fact, this move is not open within a fully developed classical mechanics. In the first place, it is known (by inductive generalization) that as a matter of fact, as soon as the two objects approach closely enough, they will in fact interact gravitationally (at least). The gravitational forces cannot be explained in terms of chance. 56 The plenum is needed, of course, so that there will be no action at a distance. 56 See footnotes 47 and 52. 57 It is my belief that this was the view taken by Descartes, but I am not going to argue the matter in detail.</page><page sequence="19">418 FRED WILSON However, a more crucial difficulty arises. For, in the second place, even in the case of action by contact, laws are involved. The relevant law is the law of conserva- tion of linear momentum (assuming the objects to be perfectly elastic). This law is a simple deduction from the first derivative law.58 Since there is a generality involved, what happens cannot be a matter of chance, in the Aristotelian sense, but, rather, must be accounted for in terms of Natures and strivings in regular ways to satisfy one's Natural desires. But it is not merely that there is a generality involved. It is a generality which follows from a statement about forces, that they are equal and opposite. So the events supposed to be a matter of chance involve forces after all. The problem cannot be avoided in the fully developed mechanics: one must still locate the end for which an object will move a second object but not itself. This holds even if the Cartesian mechanical hypotheses are granted. Once classical mechanics is fully developed, there is no possibility of avoiding this issue by ap- pealing to chance. Once classical mechanics developed to the point where these problems arose, it became impossible for physicists to work any longer within the Aristotelian pat- terns. Nothing hung together any more. It is not surprising that the Aristotelian jargon ("force," "inertia") soon became but dead metaphors for the working scientist (though not for priests and Hlegelians). Moreover, the scientists had provided the world with a pattern of explanation far better than that of Aristotle. Newton himself realized this: if he had not, then he could not have proclaimed his intention to " . . . demonstrate the frame of the System of the World." Nor was the rest of the intellectual world long in following Newton. The world soon saw the power of process knowledge. And the perfection of such knowledge amply justified, as we saw, the erection of it into a new ideal of explanation. Toulmin argues for a certain thesis about the nature of scientific explanation. He argues for this thesis by examining explanations given by Aristotle and ex- planations given by Newton. These, he claims, show that the deductive model is wrong. If Toulmin's argument is correct, then Aristotelian "science" and modern science have the same structure, in the sense that the explanation patterns are the same (though the content for these patterns differs between the two). What Toulmin is actually doing is, as I have previously suggested, and as I shall argue for again, defending the Aristotelian pattern of explanation, as against the scientific, i.e. process pattern. What I shall argue is that Toulmin's defence fails. Toulmin makes his case by examining explanations of both Aristotle and Newton. He is misleading with respect to both. Re. the Aristotelian explanations: Toulmin considers only examples of the cart- and-horse variety ([28], pp. 49-50, 52). That is, Toulmin ignores the case of self- movers, or, what is the same thing, the case of Natural Aristotelian processes. This is to neglect the most obviously anthropomorphic features of the Aristotelian 58 The first derivative law is what Newton in the Principia [21] refers to as the Third Law. The conservation of linear momentum is derived from this and appears in the Principia as Corollary III of what Newton refers to as the Laws of Motion. Cf. Symon ([27], pp. 135 if.), for the derivation of the principle of the conservation of linear momentum, and the usual properties of the center of mass.</page><page sequence="20">EXPLANATION IN ARISTOTLE, NEWTON, AND TOULMIN 419 patterns; that by itself makes these patterns look much more respectable. But there is a further point. We saw that if classical mechanics is Aristotelianized, then there will be no Natural Aristotelian processes. By ignoring self-movers, Toulmin can make it appear that the explanations of Aristotle appeal, just as do the explanations of an Aristotelianized classical mechanics, to only external forces.59 Thus, Toulmin makes it appear that Aristotle is closer to classical mechanics than he really is. Moreover, Toulmin strongly emphasizes the pieces of imperfect knowledge which are in fact embodied in the explanations which Aristotle gives ([28], p. 51). In other words, he emphasizes what is genuinely scientific in Aristotle while simul- taneously playing down the nonscientific, anthropomorphic features of the Aris- totelian patterns. Re. the Newtonian explanations: Toulmin here concentrates on the use of the piece of imperfect knowledge (I) as used to explain the behavior of individual objects ([28], pp. 55-59). Toulmin ignores Newton's demonstration of "the frame of the System of the World." This is to concentrate on what Newton and Aristotle have in common and to ignore that in which they differ. Both propound imperfect laws, laws which typically have "exceptions." But they differ in that Newton, unlike Aristotle, relates these laws to pieces of perfect knowledge, laws which do not have "exceptions." The result is to again make Newtonian and Aristotelian explanations look more alike than they really are. Furthermore, Toulmin ignores the theoretical structure of classical mechanics, those deductive connections which enable one to arrange the laws into a system of axioms and theorems. This enables him to blur the two roles of the Law of Inertia, as an axiom, and as (I), a piece of imperfect knowledge. Indeed, it is precisely because Toulmin's account of the nature of scientific explanation blurs these two roles of the Law of Inertia that I want to say that his is an attempt to revive the Aristotelian pattern of explanation at the expense of the scientific pattern. Or, at least, it is because of this, together with something else, namely, the failure on Toulmin's part to note that the word 'force' in Aristotle is thoroughly anthropomorphic, whereas in classical mechanics it is but a convenient piece of shorthand,60 with nothing anthropomorphic about it. (It might look anthropomorphic if classical mechanics is viewed, as, for example, it was viewed by Newton himself, through Aristotelian spectacles; but there is nothing in the logical structure of classical mechanics which renders 'force' as anything but short- 5 Thus Toulmin ([28], p. 28), assimilates the "F oc W x V" (force varies as weight times velocity) of Aristotelian "mechanics" to the "F = M x A" (force varies as mass times ac- celeration) of classical mechanics. The 'F' of the former is external force; the 'W' is internal force or resistance. The 'F' of the latter is defined as short for 'M x A'; the 'M' is defined in terms of acceleration ratios. Toulmin fails to note the shift from anthropomorphic to non- anthropomorphic language which vitiates his comparisons. But more importantly, all Toulmin considers is "F cc W x V"; he does not stop to point out that in the Aristotelian case there is a second formula, namely " W oc V." The first Aristotelian formula, the one which mentions external forces, applies to Unnatural states and processes; the second applies to Natural pro- cesses (of heavy objects in the sublunar region). By noting only the first and not the second Aristotelian formula, Toulmin generates a spurious analogy with the "F = M x A" of classical mechanics. 60 It is convenient because it is significant. Axiom three makes it significant.</page><page sequence="21">420 FRED WILSON hand way of speaking about the product of mass and acceleration or component acceleration.) From examples of the cart-and-horse variety Toulmin extracts the following as the pattern of Aristotelian explanations. There are three features. (oa) There is the paradigm pattern of behavior. If an object is behaving in the paradigm pattern, then no further explanation is needed. Such behavior is "self-explanatory," "natural" ([28], p. 41), and "in need of no further comment" ([28], p. 56). (/) Behavior which is not in the paradigm pattern, constitutes a phenomenon ([28], p. 52). Phenomena require further explanation. The cause of the deviation from the paradigm pattern must be given. This means that the theory involved must (y) state that in terms of which phenomena are accounted for ([28], pp. 45-46, 57). Call the (a), (p3, (y) pattern, the "T-pattern" of explanation. Re. (oa): This is simply what I have called continuing in a Natural state. This is seen by noting two of Toulmin's examples of paradigmatic behavior, namely, a terrestrial body in a state of rest ([28], p. 52), and the planets moving in circles ([28], p. 41). Moreover, such behavior is self-explanatory. But it is not form of the paradigmatic behavior which explains the behavior of the individual. So the explanation is not one in terms of laws alone. That shows the force of 'natural' and 'self-explanatory' to be this: an object's behaving in the paradigmatic way is "self- explanatory" in the sense that it is explained by pointing to the object itself, and not anything else, i.e., one might reasonably suggest, by pointing to the Nature of the object behaving in this way. Re. (0): A phenomenon occurs when an object is behaving in any but the para- digmatic way. In the case of Aristotle, Toulmin cites the case of a cart moving horizontally (when pulled by a horse) as an example of a phenomenon ([28], p. 51). Given what was just said about (a), phenomena are those ways in which an object behaves when it is not behaving Naturally; Toulmin's example thus accords with that explication of paradigmatic behavior. Re. (y): Toulmin implies that such explanations are always in terms of external forces for Aristotle. This is to ignore the case of self-movers, i.e. of Natural Aris- totelian processes. However, if one adds these for Toulmin then one obtains an accurate description of the Aristotelian explanation pattern! Any behavior other than that of continuing in a Natural state (paradigmatic behavior) is explained by appeal to forces, either external (in the case of Unnatural states and processes) or internal (in the case of Natural processes). If you want to understand the motion of a body (in his [Aristotle's] view) you should think of it as you would think of a horse-and-cart: i.e. you should look for two factors- the external agency (the horse) keeping the body (the cart) in motion, and the resistances (the roughness of the road and the friction of the cart) tending to bring the motion to a stop. Explaining the phenomenon means recognizing that the body is moving at the rate appropriate to an object of its weight, when subjected to just that particular balance of force and resistance. Steady motion under a balance of actions and resistances is the natural thing to expect. Anything which can be shown to exemplify this balance will thereby be explained ([28], p. 52). A series of comments on this passage will suffice. (1) Toulmin's dependence on the cart-and-horse examples is clear.</page><page sequence="22">EXPLANATION IN ARISTOTLE, NEWTON, AND TOULMIN 421 (2) Also clear is Toulmin's emphasis on the operative external force (the horse). (3) Toulmin mentions resistances. Some of these are external forces striving in the direction opposite that of the horse (resistance from bumps and friction (other pieces of matter resisting movement)).61 But there is also the resistance provided by the internal forces: even Toulmin alludes to the factor of weight as an element determining the terminal velocity, that is, the velocity which results from just this balance of external forces (horse, resistances) and internal forces (weight). (4) The terminal velocity is, of course, the "steady motion" which is arrived at. Toulmin has earlier mentioned Stokes' law.62 This shows he is clear that the "steady motion" is not arrived at instantaneously, but only after a time. During that time the cart will be undergoing an Unnatural Aristotelian process: when the terminal velocity is arrived at, the cart will be in an Unnatural state, determined by the strivings of the horse. So steady motion is the "natural thing to expect," though one should add that it is such only by virtue of the Nature of the horse. (5) The emphasis on what is relevant to having Aristotle anticipate Stokes' law, rather than on wlhat is relevant to the anthropomorphism, is clear. This is just part of the emphasis on the imperfect knowledge to be found in Aristotelian explanations, with the corresponding de-emphasis of the differences between Aristotelian "science" and science. Exactly the same point can be made with respect to the following: In the case of bodies moving against a sufficiently slight resistance, as we all know, Aris- totle's analysis ceases to apply. If you drop a billiard ball through the air instead of through water or treacle, it will go on accelerating for a long time: under normal terrestrial conditions, it could never fall far enought to reach the 'terminal velocity' at which Stokes' law would begin to apply. The factor of paramount importance in this case will for once be the initial period of acceleration, and that was something to which Aristotle paid very little attention. If he had thlought more about the problem of acceleration, indeed, he might have seen the need for something more sophisticated than his simple proportion- alities ([28], p. 52). Note once again the reference to Stokes' law. Once again we have the emphasis on the imperfect knowledge that is involved in Aristotelian explanations. The imperfect knowledge involved in the cart-and-horse cases (what was originally offered as the analogue of Stokes' law) is not the imperfect knowledge which is involved in the case of freely falling bodies. And Toulmin suggests that, if Aristotle had worried more about the latter, he would have altered his crude views of mech- anics. As if Aristotle were just doing mechanics! Aristotle knew full well that the freely falling object was behaving in a way that made the cart-and-horse examples not appropriate :63 that was why the movement of the cart, pulled by the horse, was a 61 Cf. [28], pp. 49-50. 62 [28], p. 51. The allusion is to the imperfect knowledge of the cart-and-horse example. Why exactly it should be thought that something from fluid mechanics is relevant to the case of a horse pulling a cart, I fail to understand; that there are terminal velocities in each is the point of similarity, but there are other radical divergences of meaning which render the analogy at best tenuous. But the point is not worth pursuing, so I shall follow Toulmin in speaking of applying Stokes' law to the cart-and-horse case. 63 In the case of objects freely falling through a medium, the citation of Stokes' law becomes reasonable. Cf. footnote 62.</page><page sequence="23">422 FRED WILSON case of Unnatural or violent behavior, whereas the freely falling object was under- going a Natural process.64 But one can say this only on condition that one is willing to point out that what is of "paramount importance" for Aristotle are strivings in accordance with one's Nature; and this condition is hard to satisfy if one also wants- to play down the anthropomorphism of Aristotelian explanations. After discussing Aristotle, Toulmin turns to trying the T-pattern on classical mechanics. Not surprisingly, he finds that it fits. He concludes that the T-pattern is the logical structure of scientific explanation. Why this sort of reasoning is indulged in, one might well wonder. At best, all that is established by it is that some people have, as a matter of fact, accepted explanations of this pattern. That is, when something fitting the T-pattern has been presented to them, they have, as a matter of fact, responded with a nod of understanding and the quizzical look has passed from their face. But, surely, the question is, ought they to have so responded ? That is, is the T-pattern a reasonable ideal of explanation? It is this which is the important question for the philosophy of science, not the question of how people respond to certain linguistic stimuli. Toulmin's argument at best answers the second question; but the first question, which it ought to be directed toward, is not touched by it. Be that as it may, Toulmin's actual argument can still be examined. The conclu- sion, that the T-pattern is the pattern of scientific explanation, at best follows only if the T-pattern fits classical mechanics in the same way that it fits the explanations of Aristotle. And it must be classical mechanics, and not simply Newton's presenta- tion of the latter. For, as we know, Newton was himself still partly in the old anthropomorphic patterns of thought even though, logically speaking, there is nothing in classical mechanics which requires one to wear the Aristotelian spec- tacles. The point which I want to make is that Toulmin's conclusion does not fol- low, the reason being that, if the T-pattern is made to fit the explanations of Aristotle then it can be made to fit classical mechanics also only if one, first, blurs the role of the Law of Inertia as an axiom and as a piece of imperfect knowledge, and second, ignores the shift in meaning in certain crucial terms which occurs as one passes from Aristotelian explanations to those of classical mechanics; i.e. only confusion could lead one to believe that Aristotelian explanations and those of classical mechanics have the same logical structure. Moreover, since Toulmin does suppose his conclusion to follow, and therefore makes these confusions, one can, with some reason, charge him with attempting to revive, at the expense of scientific explanation (i.e. explanation by means of process knowledge) the old anthropo- morphic patterns of Aristotelian explanations. Let us first look at Toulmin's account of the "traditional" view of Aristotle. The benighted man asserted that the effect of a given force acting continuously upon a given body was to keep it in motion at a constant speed; whereas we have now looked and seen that a constant force produces not a constant speed but a constant acceleration ([281, p.47). Toulmin rightly suggests that perhaps this is a caricature of a caricature ([28], p. 47). But he suggests that what is wrong with the view is that it fails to distinguish 14 As was the horse which was pulling the cart!</page><page sequence="24">EXPLANATION IN ARISTOTLE, NEWTON, AND TOULMIN 423 the paradigmatic behavior in Aristotle's theory from that of classical mechanics, attributing the latter to both ([28], pp. 49, 52). That may be so. However, it is a caricature for another reason also: because it fails to note the shift in meanings as the move is made from Aristotle to classical mechanics. In Aristotle, 'force' means "striving" or "volition" in an anthropomorphic sense; these forces or strivings are cited to explain the behaviour to be explained, that is, the motion. In classical mechanics, 'force' is a piece of shorthand, with no anthropomorphic meaning, but which is rendered significant by the third and fourth axioms (laws). The appeal to force explains nothing in classical mechanics. What provides the explanations are the laws which give the general connections between total force (i.e. product of mass and acceleration) and the circumstances in which the object finds itself; that is, what provide the explanations are the force functions which state the functional dependence of total force on circumstances. In Aristotle, forces are anthropo- morphic, while in classical mechanics they are not; in Aristotle, forces provide the explanation, while in classical mechanics they do not. By virtue of this shift the quotation indeed provides a caricature of the relations between Aristotle's ex- planations and what goes on in classical mechanics. It is something which Toulmin entirely fails to note! Toulmin sums up his thesis: ... any dynamical theory involves some explicit or implicit reference to a standard case or 'paradigm.' This paradigm specifies the manner in which [a] in the natural course of events, bodies may be expected to move. [b] By comparing the motion of any actual body with this standard example, we can discover what, if anything, needs to be regarded as a 'pheno- menon.' If the motion under examination turns out to be a phenomenon-i.e. 'an event ... whose cause is in question' [c] as being 'highly unexpected'-the theory must indicate how we are to set about accounting for it. ([d3 In Newton's theory, this is the prime task of the second law of motion.) [e] By bringing to light causes of the appropriate kind, e.g. New- tonian 'forces,' we may reconcile the phenomenon to the theory; and if this can be done we shall have achieved our 'explanation' ([28], p. 57). In the case of classical mechanics, the paradigmatic behavior is that of inertial motion: [f] ... a body's motion is treated as self-explanatory only when it is free from all forces, even including its own weight ([28], p. 55). We are provided [jg] . . . with a criterion for telling in what respects a body's motion calls for explanation; and [h] what impressed forces we must bring to light if we are to succeed in explaining it ([28], p. 56). A series of comments on these passages will establish my case. (I have inserted the letters to facilitate reference). One: Consider [b]. What it might mean in the case of Aristotelian explanations is clear. The "standard example" or "paradigm" is the object continuing in a Natural state; the "phenomena" occur when the object is not in its Natural state. In trying to apply this to classical mechanics and the Law of Inertia, i.e. that law</page><page sequence="25">424 FRED WILSON which tells us what the paradigmatic motion is, the matter is not so clear. Looking at the Law of Inertia in the light of [g], we find out that it provides us with a criterion of which kinematically describable features of a body's motion are given dynamical explanations. Thus, it is the Law of Inertia in its role as axiom one that is being talked about. For, this axiom states that the laws of dynamics are general truths relating circumstances to acceleration (rather than, say, velocity, or the third derivative of distance with respect to time). But [f] (cf. also [e], [h]), indicates that the content of the Law of Inertia is this: that paradigmatic motion occurs in case that there are no forces. And once one moves to mention forces, one has moved beyond axiom one to state something about how circumstances as a matter of fact do determine accelerations (both zero and nonzero accelerations); that is, one is now making an implicit reference to axioms two, three, and four. In other words, the discussion has shifted to (I), the Law of Inertia in its role as a piece of imperfect knowledge. This shift is simply the shift from the explanation of laws by means of the theory of classical mechanics, to the explanation of the behavior of individual objects in terms of process knowledge. (I) is not itself process knowledge, of course; but it is a piece of imperfect knowledge about systems for which process knowledge is available, process knowledge which is part of the theoretical structure of classical mechanics. Because such process knowledge is available, (I) is not of particular importance; it is superseded by the more perfect process knowledge of which it is but a part. It appears to be more important than it in fact is by virtue of its being fused and confused with axiom one. The point is, of course, that Toulmin has made his T-pattern fit classical mechanics only by creating this (con)fusion. Two: Note the occurrence of 'weight' in [f]. In the case of Aristotelian explana- tions which mention weight, the connotation is that this is due to the internal forces of the object which are striving to bring the object as close to the centre of the universe as possible. But the connotations change when it comes to classical mech- anics. In the first place, the weight of an object is due to the force of gravity, i.e. the circumstance that the object is in relatively close proximity to the earth. In the second, and still more important, place, there are no anthropomorphic connota- tions to the notion of weight (so far as the logic of classical mechanics is concerned). Three: Turn to [e]. 'Force' takes on a quite different meaning in the shift from Aristotle to classical mechanics. In the case of Aristotle, the explanations are in terms of anthropomorphic strivings. This is what it means to explain within that pattern. But in classical mechanics, to search for "forces" means simply that one is to look for the appropriate force.function, i.e. to look for a law relating circum- stances and acceleration (cf. comment two also). Toulmin's pattern is made to fit only by blurring the point that explanations for Aristotle are not in terms of laws but rather in terms of anthropomorphic strivings, while in classical mechanics explanations are in terms of laws (force functions) and nothing else. Four: The phrase 'self-explanatory' is applied to motion in the absence of 'forces'. This may mean either of two things. First, the laws which classical mechanics provides for such a case are such that no other object, besides that one in whose behavior we are interested, is mentioned. They are not mentioned because they provide no relevant variables; the object itself provides all the relevant factors,</page><page sequence="26">EXPLANATION IN ARISTOTLE, NEWTON, AND TOULMIN 425 and in this sense its motion is self-explanatory.65 Secondly, it may mean that the law or generality is explained in terms of the internal strivings of the object itself, and in terms of no external strivings.66 It is the first meaning only which is appro- priate to classical mechanics (so far as its logical structure is concerned); it is the second meaning only which is appropriate to Aristotelian explanations. Toulmin makes his T-pattern fit both only by failing to notice the shift in meaning. Five: The reference [d] to Newton's second law is illustrative. It is notorious that in the context of the Principia the second law has three features.67 It provides, first, a definition of 'total force'66 (as the product of mass and acceleration).69 It provides, second, an indication of what some of the relevant circumstances are which deter- mine the total force on an object ;70 that is, it indicates some of the relevant variables occurring in the force function.71 Thirdly, it interprets these matters in accordance 65 Recall that the law describing the motion of an isolated body is but a special case of (I). In particular, recall that it is not a special case of axiom one, the Law of Inertia in its role as an axiom. It is a special case of the Law of Inertia in its role as a piece of imperfect knowledge. 66 This blur between two senses of 'self-explanatory' occurs in Fine [121, where he suggests that Newton did not regard inertial motion as self-explanatory because he (Newton) appealed to internal forces to account for the law being true. Understanding 'self-explanatory' in a sense relevant to the Aristotelian patterns, from which Newton had not freed himself, inertial motion is still self-explanatory. Newton's Aristotelianism is explicit in the way he states what he calls the First Law: "Every body [mass] perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon." (Italics added.) Fine cites the equally relevant Definition 1II of the Principia: "The vis insita, or innate force of matter, is a power of resisting, by which every body, as much as in it lies, endeavours to persevere in its present state, whether it be of rest, or of moving uniformly forward in a right line." 67 This is stated by Newton in the Principia as: "The alteration of motion [momentum] is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed." 68 Or perhaps of 'component force.' The former view is taken by Russell ([25], p. 483); the latter view is taken by Mach ([19], p. 302). Which view one holds depends on how one inter- prets Newton's Corollary I of his Laws of Motion, which states explicitly the law of vector addition of accelerations (what I have called the fourth axiom of classical mechanics). Russell regards it as a real corollary, and so interprets the Second Law as involving 'total force.' Mach interprets it as containing something essentially new, so that the Second Law is taken to apply to total force in a two-body system and therefore to component forces. The best thing to do is simply to draw the distinctions and say that Newton was confused on the matter, that he did not fully grasp what the fourth axiom amounted to. Nor is it hard to explain the confusion: it is exactly what one would expect from someone who looked at classical mechanics through Aristotelian spectacles. For, the external forces will be localized in independent objects acting independently. To speak of two forces will seem to be like speaking of a mere conjunction. But 'p &amp; q' is a trivial consequence of 'p' and 'q'. So the "composition of forces" law will appear to be, what it in fact is not, namely, a logical consequence of preceding statements about force and the premiss that two forces are acting. The resulting blur on "sum" (mere conjunction, vector addition) is explored in Madden ([20], Chapter 1), and Bergmann ([3], chapter 3). 669 Mach ([19], pp. 300-302), interprets it as a definition, or, at least, as true by virtue of the definition of 'force.' 70 Russell ([25], p. 483), interprets it in this fashion. The difference between Mach (see foot- note 69) and Russell can be resolved after the fashion of footnote 68. 71 If one interprets Newton's Third Law after the fashion of Mach, as applying only to two- body systems, and as being the result of an implicit derivation from what I have called the second and third axioms (i.e. if one interprets it as the first derivative law), then when the Second Law is interpreted as just indicated, it becomes but a more specific version of the Third. Russell, however, takes the Third Law to be stating what Mach takes to be stated in Corollary I, namely axiom four. The just indicated interpretation of the Second Law thus takes on more importance for himrl. 7-JX .s.</page><page sequence="27">426 FRED WILSON with the Aristotelian patterns.72 (It is this last, of course, which accounts for the first two being fused together.) In other words, Newton was confused. But such confusion is irrelevant to the logical structure of classical mechanics, and so is totally irrelevant to any argument that the T-pattern applies to the explanations of classical mechanics and those of Aristotle. Six: With respect to 'natural' and 'highly unexpected' at [a] and [c], Toulmin fails completely to note two possible meanings. The first takes 'natural' and 'ex- pected' in the anthropomorphic senses relevant to the Aristotelian patterns. The second takes the words as saying something about deductions and predictions from very well-confirmed laws.73 The latter suffices for classical mechanics but not for Aristotelian explanations; for these only the former suffices. This distinction enables one to hold that (ca), (/), (y) in the T-pattern take on one meaning with respect to classical mechanics and another with respect to Aristotelian explanations, and that therefore logically speaking the same pattern of explanation is not shared by both, or, in other words, that Aristotelian "science" is not science. I conclude that Toulmin has failed to make his case. Nor can one even say that the failure is glorious. What I think I have shown is that Toulmin's discussions are philosophically at an extraordinarily superficial level. One wonders wherein lies the appeal. There are, I think, two roots. Firstly, if I am right then what Toulmin is doing is to revive subtlely the Aristotelian patterns of explanation, the patterns destroyed by science. It would follow that Toulmin's work has the psychological appeal that the Aristotelian patterns have, the same psychological appeal that prevented the move from Aristotelian "science" towards the more reasonable ideal of process knowledge. Secondly, To-ulmin's work involves the attempt to put more into the "conceptual" aspects of science than rightly belongs there. ("Conceptual analysis" amounts to the search for Aristotelian "real definitions.") A rationalism such as this enables the philosopher, who does "conceptual analysis," to claim the right to do what is in fact something which only the scientist, that is, the investigator of empirical facts, can justifiably claim the right to do ([28], pp. 107 if.). Toulmin's work has the ideological role of transferring certain areas of investigation from the domain of science (where they rightly belong) to the domain of philosophy.74 It is not the first time that a rationalism such as Toulmin's has performed this role.75 Nor, unfortunately, is it likely to be the last.76 72 Thus, compare Newton's Definition IV: "An impressed force is an action exerted upon a body, in order to change its state, either of rest, or of moving uniformly forward in a right line." 73 This blurs in paradigm rules a la Hanson (see footnote 53). Cf. Toulmin ([28], p. 56): c;... the idea of explanation is tied up with our prior patterns of expectation, which in turn reflect our ideas about the order of Nature." The important question is this: are the ideals and expectations justified? That people have expectations, criteria of acceptability, etc. is a trivial psychological point. The philosophical question is about their reasonableness. 74 Compare my comments on Carnap in Wilson ([33], Chapter 5). ', Thus Hegel was able to inform scientists that minor planets were logically impossible, or, translating into currently fashionable jargon, "conceptually impossible." 76 It is unfortunate because it leads to an ideological defence of the claim that a science of man (in the sense of 'science' in which physics is a science) is impossible. Cf. Brodbeck [6] and [7]. In turn, to deny the possibility of a science of man, to replace, as does Oxford, the science of psychology with the a priori "conceptual analysis" of so-called theory of action, and the science of sociology with a priori explorations of the "logic" of various language games-to do this is in turn unfortunate because it is inevitably and intrinsically socially and politically conservative</page><page sequence="28">EXPLANATION IN ARISTOTLE, NEWTON, AND TOULMIN 427 REFEENCES [1] Aquinas, T., The Pocket Aquinas (ed.
