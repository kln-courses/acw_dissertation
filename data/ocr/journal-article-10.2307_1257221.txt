<plain_text><page sequence="1">COLLECTANEA TRACES OF A DIANIC CULT FROM CATALONIA TO PORTUGAL (WITH SOME NOTES ON WITCHES) DR. M. A. MURRAY'S proposition concerning a Dianic cult long surviving the introduction of Christianity into Western Europe, finds some interesting corroboration in the regions we have particularly studied. That this cult was left so entirely in the hands of the so-called witch communities, as she claims in her The Witch-Cult in Western Europe 1 seems doubtful, for incidents which have come to our notice show good Christians to-day direct- ing the rites, in one case the town Carnival Committee. In The God of the Witches,2 Dr. Murray deserts the two-faced divinity for a horned god. Scarcely any traces of such a cult have come our way, but in the one instance where horns did appear (in the sixteenth century) a second face appeared also. The names Dianus and Diana, Janus and Jana are but dupli- cates of each other, the second form being a corruption of the first which contains the Indo-European root di. This, of course, means " bright " and appears in dies. Put very shortly, this god and his consort were fertility gods, associated with the oak tree, thunder (therefore rain), and fecundity in general, and were identified with the sun and the moon. The door-keeping duties of Janus were later obligations, for he was once the beginning of everything, was invoked before any other god, and gave his name to the first month of the year. Diana was an ancient Italian deity long before she became identified with the Greek huntress, Artemis. Whether the cult of this sacred pair can be ascribed solely to Roman influence in the great stretch of wild country we are about to cover, seems doubtful. It would be 1 The Clarendon Press, 1921. 2 Sampson Low, Marston and Co. Ltd., London. 350</page><page sequence="2">Collectanea 351 more probable to suppose that their names came from Italy to be imposed upon local divinities of similar properties, and it is useful to observe that in the Basque countries, just where Roman influence was repulsed, the name Dianus is unknown. These local gods appear to have had both anthropomorphic and theriomorphic forms, and with the name extend sporadically from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic coast. It must be added that they are completely overshadowed by the much clearer remains of a Mother goddess, connected with rocks and rocky peaks, whose cult, covering the same region, needs no such careful examination of ancient dust to reveal itself-for it is not dead yet. Diana, of course, carried some of the same attributes as the Mother goddess, presiding over child- birth and young women. We are not concerning ourselves with the medieval "witches" known to us by their trials, nor with the present day witches who prescribe charms and overlook their enemies, for this last would be a subject all too vast in a country where charms are habitually said for most of the occasions of life, and where magic cannot be separated from daily doings, nor from religious belief and acts, the clergy themselves blessing the candles to be used during thunderstorms, and ordering the Church bells to be rung to keep off the hail. We will, however, give three examples which demonstrate that this region shows no peculiarities in the stories told about witches, but comes exactly into line with the rest of Western Europe. I. The first witch trial known to us was held near Carcassonne in 1275, forty-nine years before the first such trial in England. The accused woman, like ninety-nine out of a hundred other " witches," confessed with joy the delights of consorting with her " demon." 3 2. In Spanish Catalonia there are witches' threshing floors where Sabbats are said to be held. The congregation goes thither in two single files (two Chain Dances) carrying brooms, and dances a giddy dance. Their " Lady " sits on a rock as on a throne. They gather Gaston Jourdaine, Folk-Lore de l'A ude (Paris, Igoo).</page><page sequence="3">352 Collectanea herbs during the night, and dance the Ball Rodo, the Round Dance, singing : " Ball Rodo, Caterineta, Caterineta, Ball Rodo, Caterineta, Caterin%." 3. Fenil is used everywhere to keep out witches, for they have to count each leaf before entering. So on St. John's Eve you hang a bunch on the door, and take care to change the water in the herrades (water-pots), for on this night witches are believed to come and foul the water (B6arn). Our first sight of two-faced devotees is at Arles-sur-Tech in the French Catalan Pyrenees. They are attendant on the Candlemas Bear, who on the Sunday following that feast is hunted, captured, turned into a dancing bear, " married " to a girl, shaved and killed, the whole town following the rite with excitement and zeal. The two-faced attendants number from four to a dozen. They wear women's cotton dresses, broad leathern belts to which are attached eight or ten large cow-bells. Their head dresses are small barrels covered with a yellowish oiled paper, on which two faces are painted, one before and one behind. Wooden noses jut realistically on either face, and long, wild hair is made from plaits of garlic leaves from which the bulbs have been torn. Their cask heads are heavy and airless, and are frequently worn tipped back on their shoulders, which are padded for the purpose. Their function is vague-they take no part in the hunt-until the Bear begins to dance, when they dance too. Towards dusk and just before the shaving operation begins, they crouch together in a group, and the Bear, armed with an enormous sapling attacks their barrel-heads until the tops fly off, sawdust and stuffing pour out, the sapling breaks, and the carefully prepared double-faces are beaten in.4 " They must be finished off," say the people of Arles. They also say they are " to frighten the Bear," and beyond this no explanation of their presence is forthcoming. They may, perhaps, pass for ritualists in the garb of their two-faced 4 For a detailed account of this, see Violet Alford, The National Review, Feb. i931, and " The Springtime Bear in the Pyrenees," Folk- Lore, vol. xli, No. 3.</page><page sequence="4">Collectanea 353 divinity, who himself in animal form, now shows no second face. Candlemas, of course, is a significant day, one of the chief pre- Christian feasts and a date on which witches are particularly powerful. Everywhere along the Pyrenees precautions are taken on this day, candles, garlic, salt and apples, etc., are taken to Church to be blessed, prayers are said waving the blessed candle three times round your head, dropping wax on your left shoulder, and burning a bit of your hair. The father of the house (Navarre) performs this rite himself for his entire house- hold as well as for his animals. The candles are most carefully preserved, often in the mistress's own bedroom, to be produced and lit during thunderstorms throughout the ensuing year. The Aridge valley possesses a weather-saying, mentioning " January with two (and sometimes three) faces," considered by a local folklorist to contain an allusion to Janus. But more probably this merely refers to the inordinate difference between a sunny day and a windy one in that perfidious month and valley. More apposite is the cry of Sainte Foi d'Agen, whose martyr- dom is sung in an eleventh-century troubadour song, founded on a " Passion de Ste Foi " previous to 875 A.D., and existing in a tenth-century MS.5 This little-known saint is reputed to be the daughter of a Christian chief of Agen. During the Diocletian persecutions, at the young age of twelve, she was ordered to offer incense " to the God Silvius and to pray to Diana and the God Janus." She replied that she would not pray " sa Diane," and when the Basques of Aran heard of her death they shrieked with joy. The Troubadour indeed, charges them with the actual decapita- tion, and this was long brought up against them. " Tota Basconn et Aragons A l'encontrada delz Gascons Sabon quals es aquist canezons." 5 Chanson de Sainte Foi d'Agen, Poeme provengal du xi siecle 6dit6 d'apres le manuscrit de Leide avec facsimil6, traduction, notes et glossaire par Antoine Thomas (Paris, 1925) ; see also Rodney Gallop, A Book of the Basques, p. ii (Macmillan). z</page><page sequence="5">354 Collectanea The story teems with interesting points. Not only is Silvius (supposed to have preceded even the antique Janus as guardian of the oakwoods and of thunder) here introduced with Diana and Janus, showing that so far west and so far from Rome these gods (or, as we suggest, local gods called after them), were of the first importance, but Aran, the great central valley of the Pyrenees is spoken of as peopled by Basques. These Basques are coupled with Aragonese, and correctly, for Aragon once belonged to Vascons, who left their place-names scattered across the province. Further these Basques were pagan, since they rejoiced at, or even accomplished a Christian girl's martyr- dom; and the Basques were not converted, even in the present Pays Basque, until the eleventh century, and then with relapses. Was the two-faced god one of their deities, that they so resented the refusal to sacrifice to him ? Finally the line " Cisclan'l Bascon, qe son d'Aran " 6 pictures them giving vent to their peculiarly terrifying form of the Pyrenean cry, the neighing, shrieking, " jodling " irrintzina. Other references to a Dianic cult in this central Pyrenean region are from Toulouse, where a statue (? ) of Janus was found in the ruins of the temple building known as the Daurade, and altars (? ) to Diana, who inhabited the Ardenne forest, now absorbed in the Toulouse suburbs, and who may be perpetuated in the famous Regina PC d'Auca (Queen with the Goose-Foot), a being who carries arrows, owns invisible barking dogs, hates those who befoul fountains, preserves woods and crops, and spins for kindly people.7 This being seems to combine several attributes of the classical Diana with a local peculiarity and a still quite lively fame. An allusion to Janus was also found at Troubat-en-Barousse,8 and here the classic god may be intended, for this village is well within the influence of the great Gallo-Roman city, Lugdunum Convenarum, now St. Bertrand de Comminges. 6 Cisclar, gisclar (Provengal), Xisclar (Catalan) means first to give piercing cries, secondly to whistle. 7Du Mege, Archeologie Pyreneenne (Toulouse, 1858). 8 Ibid.</page><page sequence="6">Collectanea 355 The Church porch at Moissac (on the Garonne near Agen), shows a carving of a naked woman, a toad serving in lieu of a fig leaf, and a devil by her side; another, on a wall at Castel- gaillard, shows a woman galloping on a lance. Du Mege wished to transport this to Toulouse museum, but the inhabitants of the village refused to let it go, saying that if they were deprived of it hail would destroy their harvest, and the river would come down in flood.9 This figure then, is clearly connected with a fertility power, and the galloping on the lance reminds us of the conventional witch on her broomstick. This unchristian night riding was first mentioned in a decree attributed to a General Council of Ancyra, of the ninth century, and is thus quoted by Dr. Murray. " Certain wicked women, reverting to Satan, and seduced by the illusions and phantasms of demons, believe and profess that they ride at night with Diana. . ." although the flying of women transformed into owls was known long before that date, for Lucius Apulieus writes of a lady who thus amused herself, anointing herself with a secret ointment which enabled her to take to the air.10 Four hundred years after the decree just quoted, women still indulged in their nocturnal rides-or believed they did so. An episcopal statute of Auger de Montfaucon, 1279-1304, says " Nulla mulier se nocturnis equitare cum Diana paganorum, vel cum Herodiade seu Bensozia, et in numina multitudinem profiteatur." The introduction of Herodias was a peculiarity of the Dianic cult in its late days, and Auger de Montfaucon is not the only churchman who mentions it; Bensozia, according to Du Mege, was a goddess of happiness, who gave quantities of children to her worshippers, and who rode through the air followed by women devotees." This sounds like a duplication of Diana. In the Church of Cazeaux (valley of Larboust, above Luchon) are a quantity of fourteenth-century frescoes, some of which depict the weighing of souls, their departure into the mouth of 9 Du Mige, op. cit. 10 The Golden Asse, between 125 and 165 A.D.

The officiating devils are accommodated each with a second face, not behind, but on their stomachs. The scene is, of course, quite conventional in the ecclesiastical style, but the two-faced notion persists even under priestly direction, and presently we shall see that the Devil and Dianus are one. In the valley of Campan, rising from Bagnbres de Bigorre to the great Tourmalet pass, " witch " dances are still alive, done to-day not by members of the Dianic cult, but by scarlet hooded and blue b6reted girls and men. These, seeking their own regional dances, tired, one supposes, of Jazz, were taught these " witch " dances by an old shepherd from the pass. He owns to having seen witches performing them " in a copse." One is the Chain Dance, a formation which, according to all accounts at trials and elsewhere, was in general use at the Sabbats, and another, an exceedingly curious sight, is performed in a squatting attitude. The girls, after a Country Dance figure, done in this same posture, hop away, still squatting, into the corners, while the men do the " Kibby " squatting step in the centre. It is so obvious that they are imitating small animals, that the name of the dance comes as no surprise, Era Pelha ded Gat, the Cat's Skin. Like actors who get " into the skin " of their r6les, these people have, so far as they are able, enwrapped themselves in the skins of cats. Did not a Pyrenean woman witness that " those who thus transformed themselves (into cats, hares or other animals), said they were not really transformed, but only that they seemed to be so ? " 11 A reputed place for Sabbats, near Sabarat (Aridge) is the Prat des Gats, the Cats' Field, where a dolmen was inhabited by a witch named Mathbe, which strange appellation puts one in mind of matou, a tom-cat; and I may here mention the curious figure cut by Saint Agatha along the mountain range from Aude to B6arn. The Languedoc form of her name not only makes her " Santo Gato," Saint Cat, but gives her a cat form, in which she appears, very angrily, to punish women who work on her day, 5th February. She rules thunderstorms and hail, and weather 11 Pierre de Lancre, Tableau de l'Inconstance des Mauvais Anges et Demons (Paris, 1613), p. 128.</page><page sequence="8">Collectanea 357 forecasts are made on her day, the peasants divining from clouds where storms will gather during the summer. They ring the Church bells to warn off hail, which is " made " on that day, and tap their fruit trees with a switch,12 and, less generous than the Somerset apple wassaillers, put a stone for bread in the forks of the trees.13 This day marks the passing of winter. " Per Santo Gato Semeno la pourato, Tiro l'aigo del prat, Que l'hiber es passat.14 " For Saint Agatha's Day Sow leeks, Drain the water from the field, For winter is passed." Along the whole length of the chain, witches and fairies are indiscriminately called Fados, Hados, Hadas, Encantados, the first three being varying langue d'oc forms of the same word. Confusion between all these, the returned Souls of the Dead, and even the Loup-Garou is apparent. The last must be a man, " who puts on a skin at night," and when forms of Bruja, Breicho, and so on, are used they are applied to women. At Erp (Aridge) you say " Broucho, diable," three times, when you meet one.15 The Fados, more mysterious than a human Bruja, and con- stantly connected with the numberless fertility stones, are recognised as something pagan. Like the Austrian Perchten and Styrian Carnival Runners, who must hide when they hear Church bells, " Las Fados an disparegut, dempei que souno l'Angelus." 16 " The Fados have disappeared since the Angelus sounds." An Aude legend relates that as Jesus was led to crucifixion the Brouchos followed, effacing his footprints (a deadly Pyrenean insult) with a coffeepot. He turned to them and said : " Broucho qu'es, e Broucho que siras, james al cel non din- trarets." " Witch thou art, and Witch thou shalt be, never shalt thou enter into Heaven."

These beings cease to be found across Basque territory. Human Brujas become Sorguinak and Fados do not seem to exist. At the time of the witch trials and burnings in Labourd (1609) Basque witches paid devotion to their god in the form of a goat, " with a tail, and beneath it a black human face," as they declared before the notorious judge, de Lancre-thus com- bining the horned form with the two-faced form. At the present day, in a Basque valley on the south side of the chain, a two- faced personage appears, the Leader and Fool of the Ochagavia ritual dancers. The eight dancers are pure " Morris men," jingling with bells, fluttering with ribbons, performing both stick and handkerchief dances. They come out on their Fiesta Mayor, 8th September, the Nativity of the Virgin. The Fool is a much older man than the dancers, and lords it over them, hitting them, poking them with his stick, and lashing at them with his thong. He wears two red embroidered Navarrese saddlebags, one in front and one on his back, bell pads on his legs, and from the back of his cap hangs a piece of stuff on which a face is painted. They can give no explanation of this; " Es el Bobo," is all they say. Immediately to the west of the Basque lands we find the word -ana in all its purity. So this is the place to give a short catena of its various forms, with their birthplaces and local meanings. In Sardinia dana means witch.a In the old Neapolitan dialect d7anara means nymph.b In old Italian Gana, and in old French Gene meanswitch orfairy. c In the central Pyrenees we have already found Fado, Hado (feminine) and Hada meaning witch or fairy. The old Spanish form was Yana.dl7 In the Montafia de Santander we find danassana and Anxana, both witches and fairies.17A 17 a, b, c and d are from Folk-Lore y Costumbres de EspaLta, vol. i. Ed.

Here, most significant of all, Dianu means Devil, and the Diano Burl6n is a kind of faun.g In Galicia Xas are ghosts or spirits,h 17 and the Devil is again o Diano, and curious it was to come upon an article in the regional paper " Nos " entitled, " Robert Burns e o Diano." In Portugal the name reappears in a variety of forms. In his exhaustive list of the names by which the Devil is known, Jos6 Leite de Vasconcellos includes Di^nho.18 In the Algarve, the southernmost and smallest of the Portuguese provinces, the belief persists, according to the same writer, in women called Yas or Yans for whom it used to be customary to leave a skein of flax and a cake of bread on the hearth. In the morning the flax would be found to have been spun as fine as hair,19 and the cake to have disappeared. " Many people declare that their ancestors possessed sheets spun by the Jans. . . . In the Algarve, too," he continues, without apparently realising the significance of the fact, " it is very usual to exclaim 'Probe Jam ! ' or' Probe Janes !' for ' Poor Devil '." 20 In the Farsa de Ines Pereira (1523) Gil Vicente makes In s exclaim (line 274), " Oh Jesus! que Yam das bestas! " the sense apparently being " What a monster of a beast." A few miles to the north of Cintra, from which it is clearly visible, lies a little white village called Janas. Its church, circular in shape, is quite obviously built on the foundations of a pagan temple, and, to make assurance doubly sure, and also to hint at the origin of the name, a Roman inscription shows a fragment of stone found on the spot to have been part of a votive tablet to the Dei Manes. To-day it is dedicated to Sao Mamede, patron saint of livestock.

I could obtain neither visual nor oral confirmation of the supposed sacrifice. My trouble was not wasted, however, for the peasants were all coming in from the surrounding countryside, bringing their beasts with them, and driving them, on arrival, three times round the outside of the church. An old patriarch, in a black stocking cap and long white side-whiskers, would slowly lead a yoke of plough-oxen round the appointed course. A moment later there would follow a string of old women in red or green velvet jackets and golden chains, riding on donkeys. Then would come a whole flock of sheep with a mounted drover, bleating and raising in clouds the yellow August dust. The curious thing was that they all went " widdershins," one man who started to go sunwise being sharply called to order. On completing the three circuits the people went into the church and bought wax ex-votos in the form of cattle, which they offered up on the altar, and coloured favours with which they adorned their beasts. Having now reached the Atlantic seaboard of Europe, let us hear what Saint Martin of Braga 21 had to say about these beings in 572-574 A.D. One would have hoped, at this early date, to have learnt valuable details, but the Bishop of Braga's classical and Christian education closed his eyes to the real meaning of his rustics' back- slidings, as these two things have closed the eyes of every observer until the beginnings of modern folklore study. Has not the Maypole invariably been cited as the remains of the Roman Floralia-even in countries where Roman feet never trod ? Have not offerings of pins and oatcake to wells, and so forth, invariably been to " devils " ? So we find St. Martin laying down that of the many demons who had been expelled from Heaven, some lived in the sea... some in rivers, some in fountains, some in woods, and that these last were Dianas. (He does not particularise oakwoods, but the northern and western coast of Spain is rich in pollarded oak- woods.) His rustics, he says, return to the cult of the Devil (he 21 " De Correctione Rusticorum," as given in Espai~a Sagrada, vol. xv. 1759.</page><page sequence="12">Collectanea 361 uses Diaboli though to the worshippers their god was probably, o Diano), and again worship stones, trees, fountains, and burn candles at places where three roads meet. Here we have Diana in person, presiding over the trivia. We hear that offerings were made to fire as to fountains, and that enchanted grass was used to work maleficence. To-day, the whole way along the route we have travelled, herbs and grass, enchanted because picked in the magic dusk of St. John's Eve, is used for protection against the descendants of these ancient workers of maleficence, the followers of the Dianic cult-if Dr. Murray is right.
