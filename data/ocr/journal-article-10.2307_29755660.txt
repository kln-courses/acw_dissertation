<plain_text><page sequence="1">P. M. Debirov, Rez'ba po kamnju v Dagestane (Rock carvings in Daghestan) (Moscow, ? Nau ka? Publ. House, Central Department of Oriental Literature, 1966, 94 pp., 216 ill.). From the remotest times Daghestan has been the ? mountain of many languages ?. And in fact the present-day Daghestan Autonomous Republic with an area of 50,300 square km., supports a population of 1,291,000 inhabitants split up into more than 30 nationalities and ethnic groups and speaking a host of tongues and dialects some of which are quite different from each other. Largely mountainous as its position is on the northern slopes of the Great Caucasus, Daghestan was already inhabited in Palaeolithic times as is proved by the flint artifacts discovered in several localities, while in the Neolithic period the population was mainly devoted to hunting in the hilly parts and consisted of primitive farming communities in the plain. In the latter, a number of sites and burials dating back to the Bronze Age (the 2nd millennium B.C.) have come to light. Finds reveal that these ancient tribes along the Daghestan shore of the Caspian Sea were engaged in agriculture and the breeding of livestock, and that they had ties, and traded, with other populations in the northern Caucasus and with the steppes north of the Caucasus. And it is this age which is reckoned to have seen man's first settlement in the highland areas of Daghestan. On of the best known sites in Daghestan is the Chalcolithic one of Kajakent , about 250 km. north of Tiflis: it is fortified and belongs to the second half of the third millennium; but in the Bronze Age, too, in the 1st half of the 1st millennium when the so-called Kajakent Horocei culture arose in Daghestan, it is known to have been inhabited by farmers and breeders of livestock. With increasing clarity the many tribes of Daghestan are seen to fall into two main groups: the mountain-dwelling tribes engaged in animal husbandry to the west, and the coastal communities devoted to primitive agriculture and cattle-breeding to the east. By and large this is the very broad picture of the area obtaining until the 7th cent. B.C. when the Scythians invaded and crossed this land bound for Transcaucasia and Asia Minor. Throughout its prehistory and history, in fact, Daghestan was a typical transit area crossed by a large caravan and trade route that via Asia Minor and Transcaucasia linked eastern Europe on the one hand with the Caucasus and the Iranian world on the other. Buth ethnocentric isolation and communications in an oriental and Eurasian direc? tion are paradoxically combined in these Caucasian regions which thereby bear unmistakable marks of geographical, historical and cultural originality. Situated in the eastern mountain chain of Daghes? tan is one of the great obligatory mountain passes between East and West, the Derbent pass, the ?Iron Gate? or Portae Albanicae (Portae Ca spiae?) of autiquity. This gorge was renowned for its fortifications, an immense construction in masonry built by the Sassanians which extends as a sort of ? Chinese Wall ? ? also erected to hold the nomads at bay ? for a distance of 80 km. into the hinterland. It forms one of the most striking and also one of the most bloody historico geographic watersheds, as it were, between East and West, between those conquering peoples coming from the steppes of Inner Asia and the sedentary peoples of the Near East. To name them all is beyond our powers: a hundred episodes and a host of peoples belonging to ancient and medieval history would have to be evoked. V. V. BartoPd (Socinenija, III, pp. 408 ff.) rightly points out that this pass divides Daghestan ? into two parts, the southern one being largely orientated towards the states of high culture of Asia Minor and the northern one towards the nomad com? munities of southern Russia ?. m Bartol'd's article in the E.I. continues to be the most detailed historical survey devoted to Daghestan: it can be consulted to advantage by the reader of the present review who will gain a good idea of the geograph? ical and cultural landscape that is the background to the book of art and archaeology we are examining. That this background is complex and hetero? geneous is plain enough after what has been said about the storied ethnic and cultural past of the region. Daghestan's artistic output begins in its prehistory and proto-history marked by a wealth of sites and associated finds that for several decades have been the object of intense activity by archaeologists and investigators. It goes without saying that a transit area like this region of the eastern Caucasus will afford evidence of more or less close and lasting ties with the neighbouring territories of the northern Caucasus and Trans? caucasia, and indirectly with Asia Minor on the one hand and the Steppenkulturen of southern Russia on the other. The material pertaining to 162</page><page sequence="2">the artistic culture peculiar to the many peoples of Daghestan over several millennia is boundless; and the Author of this monograph, Paruk Mur tasalievic Devirov ? whom we believe must himself hail from the Caucasus ? has wisely chosen to concentrate on one branch only: figural carving on stone and to be more precise, rock drawings on cliff faces and sepulchral monuments ? in short the art of petroglyphs which is one of the oldest in existence. It is an art that relies on the sim? plest techniques ? carved lines and lines made up of dots, for example ? and yet the effects created are at times striking. On the other hand, it is also true that the result is not just to be viewed artistically; it is not in any sense an art pour Vart\ but, as Debirov has clearly perceived, a form of magico-ritualistic and apotropaic repre? sentation, of ? hunting magic?, and so on. All this is widely known now after a host of palaeo ethnological and historico-artistic studies have been devoted to these primordial petroglyphs which, it can be said, are common the world over from the time of the hunters of the glacial period down to our own day. Carved figural work on stone surfaces have been discovered in all regions of Daghestan though mainly in the highlands; but the most ancient of these dating back to the Bronze Age are the rock drawings that have come to light in the northern and flat part of the land. It is well-known that this art is amazingly long lasting and betrays a fondness, often lasting many thousands of years, for the same localities that are evidently felt to be suffused with a particular ? numinous ? quality. Suffice it to recall the rock drawings of diverse styles and ages to be found in Val Camonica (north-east Italy) some of which are easily datable (the Bronze and pre-Roman Iron Ages, the Imperial Roman and medieval periods and even the modern epoch). The same surpris? ing coexistence of styles and periods in one spot and visible on the same rock surface (one of these in Daghestan extends for almost a km.) can be noted in many other parts of the world. Our author reproduces some modern petroglyphs of the 18th-19th cent, that are so similar to those of the Bronze Age as to be distinguished with (relative) confidence only by the well-trained eye. In this connexion we may recall the most memo? rable, if not the most exhilarating, example of the scant ?infallibility? of the so-called ?well trained eye ? when a blunder of the first magnitude was committed: the unanimous proscription of the prehistoric painting of Altamira in Spain which was pronounced in 1880 by no less a body than the highest scientific authority in this field, the International Congress of Anthropology and Historical Archaeology at Lissabon. ?Les belles peintures sont fort recentes ? was the verdict then passed by all the luminaries of scholarship on the marvellous ? Cappella Sixtina of the glacial epoch ? (Breuil). This sensational episode ? and many similar ones unmentioned through lack of space ? il? lustrates how difficult the chronological attribution is of many petroglyphs including quite a number of those dealt with in the present volume. There are also kindred difficulties about dating certain rock drawings in other areas of the Soviet Union, a country that in its wealth of petroglyphs is not perhaps inferior to Spain: witness the rock pictures in Siberia and Central Asia and Oklad nikov's expeditions in the middle and upper Lena valley, etc. the results of which have often been sensational. The numerous rock drawings of Tadjikistan and Uzbekistan are assigned by spe? cialists, at least in part, to the Neolithic Period. But there are ? galleries of prehistoric art ?, like the nearly 200 paintings in red colouring on the limestone cliffs of the Zaraut-Sai Gorge in Uzbe? kistan, where the paintings belong to all periods beginning with the Mesolithic age; and this does not rule out the presence besides some drawings of Arab inscriptions belonging to the llth-13th centuries and proving that earlier ? discoverers ? visited this spot and thus became immortalised for posterity. But it may be that their purpose was to touch up the ancient figures portrayed on the rock which needed to be renewed and restored periodically so as not to lose their magic power. It is common the world over for figurative and graphic petroglyphs to exist side by side and Daghestan is no exception, for in a good many places we unfailingly come across inscriptions in Arab script in the midst of drawings dating back to an age when the invention of writing of any sort was still a far-off event. Sometimes we come face to face with a sort of rock palimpsest con? sisting of compositions added to and overlapping earlier ones, for to scrape the surface clear of previous figures was deemed a sacrilege. Hence the explorer must needs command a high degree of experience and discernment. We must confess that we are not convinced by all the datings the Author puts forward for the representations he has repro? duced: on the other hand we believe that he himself looks upon several of them as purely conjectural. Nevertheless, the Author would have been well-advised, in each case, to have indicated or still better, analysed, the reasons and pre? suppositions leading him to make specific chrono? logical attributions. Where figural work is con? cerned this analysis could have been based on criteria of form, style and content, and apart from this another desirable piece of investigation could be undertaken through the help of the natural sciences, etc.: meticulous study of the rock, or 163</page><page sequence="3">rather each individual segment of it covered with figures. The neighbourhood of the rock surface, moreover, also calls for investigation, since in a number of instances ? e.g. on the celebrated site of Suruktaakh^Khaya in the Yakutsk Lena area ? at the foot of the cliff places of sacrifice have been identified. These have been found to contain easily datable artifacts, just as in the lower layer of this site remnants of the Neolithic age have come to light. Exploration on this scale, however, would clearly exceed the scope of the task that Debirov has set himself. In all justice to the latter, it should be pointed out that in his work, which sets out to be descrip? tive and phenomenological, a "diachronic5 trend may be perceived in the succession, if we cannot call it evolution, of these representations. Indeed, Debirov remarks: ? A peculiarity, common to rock drawings, is the schematic way in which the figures are treated, so that in time the representation of deer, goats and aurochs increasingly loses all resemblance to nature. Drawings become very inaccurate, ever more strongly recalling those of children. It now becomes extremely difficult to discern the individual species of domestic animal and wild beasts ?. In fact the accuracy of this remark is confirmed by some of the illustrations the Author includes: though in a wider psychologi? cal and historical context there is nothing surpris? ing about it. In this instance, too, it is super? fluous to recall that what we are observing is the wellknown transition from the ?concrete? phase of the spirit and hence of artistic creation to the ? abstractive ? phase consisting of a primitive schematic and geometrical tendency that eschews the figurative representation of reality (cf. the mass of literature devoted to this process). On the credit side, this growing schematism at times entails a greater capacity for expression visible in the representation of certain details that are deemed essential in figures and entire scenes. The latter usually represent the hunting of deer where the protagonists are the figures of riders brandishing lances; in scenes with animals it is the latter's characteristic features that tend to get stressed. In late Bronze age rock drawings the figures of men and animals gradually Jose all contact with reality and ? are transformed into cultual repre? sentations ?. This is the interesting view put forward by Debirov who also recalls that among not a few primitive and ancient peoples the anti realistic deformation of such images enhanced their sacral power. In the Middle Ages the drawing became yet more simplified. The schematisation of animal and human figures and the concomitant introduction of ornamental features meant that figures and ornament were blended as elements in a single pattern of abstract signs that were certainly endowed with symbolic significance. One of the symbols universally recurring in figural work on rock is the female genital organ ? a conventional and magical sign to express and invoke fertility right from the Palaeolithic age. Another very widespread symbol (also in the area under consideration) belonging to the Bronze Age is the representation of the labyrinth, which was also a sacral idea. The world of these symbolic signs was not a static one: fresh signs emerge, one of them being rays radiating from the centre of a circle, a solar symbol set in the midst of a saraband of other Bronze Age figures painted in red ochre. They ore to be found in an impervious highland cavern in Daghestan, and both their location in the wilds and the nature of the figures suggest affinities with the assortment of carvings dating from the Bronze Age of the Maritime Alps, from Val camonica, etc. In the Soviet Union similar figures, also dating from the Bronze Age, are to be found in the Urals and in Kazakhstan. A striking feature of the rock drawings of Daghestan ? an area that we have seen to be in constant touch with the mounted peoples of the Russian steppes ? would seem to be the countless portraits of more or less schematic riders that from the Bronze if not the Neolithic Age stare out at us from the rock face. We have already referred to the fact that this atavic custom is slow to die; indeed, it is still alive in certain ? obscure corners ? of the Soviet Union if we are to believe the testimony of Russian ethnologists. One of the best known Russian prehistorians, A.A. Formozov {Pamjatniki pervobyt nogo iskusstva na territori SSSR - Remains of primitive art in the territory of the USSR, Moscow 1966) supplies us with some curious evidence in this respect; and from the writings of someone who is deeply versed in the customs and traditions of the mountain people of the Pamirs, B.A. Litvinskij (cf. EW, XIX, 1969, pp. 515 fl), we learn that among the peaks of those high mountains the ancestral cult of the wild mountain goat still persists, with the result that even in our own day these fanciful mountain dwellers continue to carve the silhouettes of this ? numinous ? animal on rock surfaces. If the schematic drawings of Bovidae that we meet with in several illustrations in this book correspond to this animal its cult was not unknown even in the Caucasus. Indeed, several affinities between the ideology and folklore char? acterising the world of the mountain dwellers of the Pamirs and the world of those inhabiting the Caucasus have been pointed out by specialists; and historical and ethnogenetical conclusions, that can? not be discussed here, have been based on this assemblage of analogies. Among the petroglyphic works of Daghestan, 164</page><page sequence="4">apart from those executed on rock surfaces, sepul? chral monuments carved in stone assume signal importance from an historical and artistic point of view. Various masterpieces of glyptic work can be admired in a number of clear photographs con? tained in this book, though by and large the standard of workmanship evident in these funerary and commemorative stelae obviously does not go beyond the second-rate. In Daghestan from the 7th to the 20th century the Author distinguishes between three types of such monuments: in the form of a chest, a stele or as anthropomorphic representation. The fist type comprises some of the most ancient monuments of their kind (7 th 12th cent.) most evident in the area of Derbent. The same chest-like form is also known in Azer? baijan, but in the Middle Ages it was also to be found in other Islamic areas of Central Asia and Iran. Sepulchral pillars in the form of stelae are lavishly adorned with ornaments carved in the stone, some of them being highly complex and elaborate. For the third and anthropomorphic group a large number of variants exist. The Author puts forward the interesting hypothesis that the prototype of this anthropomorphic sculp? ture is to be seen in the famous kamennye baby, the ? stone matrons ? that in their thousands are spread over the whole area of the steppes of Eurasia and have already been referred to in the columns of this journal (cf. EW, XVII, 1967, pp. 131-134, EW, XVIII, 1968, p. 375 and EW, XIX, 1969, pp. 496-499). Indeed, these mysterious stone creatures of the steppes were not unknown, as it happens, in the territory of Daghestan which, as we have already pointed out, was in part akin to the world of the steppes and plains of Eurasia and in part absorbed into the great mountain chain that forms its backbone. A proof of this is the characteristic ? idol ? found in the Daghestan plain and assigned by the Author to the 14th century, after the Mongol invasion: it is reproduced in this book among many other Islamic funerary stelae. Similar kamennye baby have been found in other parts ? of this land. Altogether, four varieties of anthropomorphic tombstone are dif? fused throughout the Daghestan area. It is in fact a pity that the Author has not dealt more thoroughly with what he argues are genetical links between the kamennye baby and the anthro? pomorphic sculpture on Daghestan tombs. It is a matter which deserves a treatise to itself but like the whole complex of problems connected with the origin and ethnic attribution of the baby it is still sub judice. The sculptural character of the ornamentation on Daghestan funerary slabs reveal a high level of quality in the petroglyphic art of this area, and its typical manifestations are accurately analysed by Debirov and illustrated by numerous photographs. It is a little known realm of artistic activity that has been revealed to us thanks to his labours which cannot be ignored in the future by scholars expound? ing the history of Islamic art.
