POOR BEDS OF STICKS AND RINGS OF PURE GOLD Material culture in the Canek Manuscript David M. Pendergasta and Grant D. Jonesb a Royal Ontario Museum, 100 Queen's Park, Toronto, Ontario M5S 2C6, Canada bDepartment of Anthropology and Sociology, Davidson College, Davidson, NC 28036, USA Abstract The Canek Manuscript offers an unusual opportunity for examination of the material culture of the Itza Maya of the seventeenth century. The document contains information about beds, canoes, musical instruments, royal jewelry and clothing, buildings, and religious objects. We interpret the textual information in terms of its reflection in the archaeological record and in ethnohistoric and ethnographic sources. The belief that complimentarity should exist between ethnohis torical documents and Spanish-period archaeological data has been a fundamental element in southern Lowland Maya stud ies almost from the outset (see Graham, Pendergast, and Jones 1989:1254-1255). The opportunity for direct comparison of the two classes of information in the southern Maya Lowlands has not, however, existed until recently, owing to the lack of archae ological data from Spanish-period communities. This problem has begun to be remedied as a limited archaeological profile of the period 1544-1707 has emerged from the excavation of Lamanai, in northern Belize (Pendergast 1981, 1986a, 1986b), and more recently of Tipu, at the country's west-central border (Graham and Bennett 1989; Graham, Jones, and Kautz 1985). The data from these two sites provide us for the first time with a basis for assessing Spanish documentary references in archae ological terms. Archaeological research on the island of Flores, the site of the Itza capital, has thus far been limited in scope and has produced little information on the Late Postclassic and early Historic periods (see Chase 1983; Cowgill 1963). Unfortunately, the lesson driven home by examination of the southern lowlands ethnohistoric record is the one learned by ev ery archaeologist whose work interdigitates with ethnohistory and vice versa: in the area of material culture the documents of fer much to whet one's appetite but precious little to satisfy one's hunger. Although many objects may be mentioned, they are al most never described adequately. The problem arises often enough in the most routine accounting of mundane matters, where material culture was, in most cases, neither rich nor a fo cus of the writer's attention. Nowhere is its presence more pain ful, however, than in the narratives of important events that offered Spaniards unparalleled stages on which to observe and record the costumes and the scenery as well as the players. The Canek Manuscript, one of few accounts of the rare meetings between Spanish clergy and Maya royalty during the last years of Itza power in the Guatemalan Peten, is just such a narrative. The circumstances of the encounter provided the manuscript's anonymous author with abundant opportunities to commit detail to paper, but the archaeologist notes with dis may that he let them slip by almost entirely unrealized. This is not surprising; it was not the author's purpose, after all, to pro vide either his contemporaries or future archaeologists with data on late seventeenth-century Maya material culture. This docu ment was intended for a far different audience, one for whom the material culture of pagan peoples generated little interest. Nevertheless, the author did address material culture both in passing and, in the case of Canek's costume, in striking but in complete detail. We comment here on the broader context of the document's contribution to an understanding of Peten Maya material cul ture in light of previous and ongoing archaeological and ethno historical research. Many of the topics raised could be treated in far greater depth and, as recent research at San José on Lake Peten demonstrates (Andrew Hofling, personal communication 1992), comparisons with modern Itza material culture would also be instructive. We have, however, intentionally restricted our coverage to specific commentary on a single manuscript be cause to go further would raise the prospect of transforming commentary into large-scale treatise. We hope through this short, initial effort to stimulate the realization that the Itza ma terial corpus was rich and complex, and that the paucity of ar chaeological excavation on this place and period deserves to be remedied. In closing we reflect upon the value of the Canek Manuscript from both archaeological and ethnohistorical per spectives. MATERIAL CULTURE DESCRIPTIONS IN THE MANUSCRIPT The author's references to items of material culture are rich but few in number, and in no case do they bear on a variety of objects in a single archaeological artifact class or single raw material category. As a result, it seems preferable to organize the cultural descriptions in the textual order employed by the author of the document. 281</page><page sequence="2">282 Pendergast and Jones Sleeping accommodations (Folio 5:163-164) We have to accept that one who had suffered a "poor bed of sticks" might be disinclined to describe the scene of his noctur nal discomfort, but at least a few details of bed form and con struction would have been most welcome here because we know virtually nothing about Maya sleeping arrangements of any pe riod. The material used for the beds suggests the sort of quickly constructed device employed today in bush camps, with forked sticks set in the ground as supports for side rails, across which are laid palm leaf ribs (chosen for their near uniformity and their smoothness). The fact that Fathers Avendaño and Pérez were able to step over the beds shows that they were narrow and set low, characteristics necessary to keep this type of construc tion stable. Landa wrote in the sixteenth century that in the enclosed back rooms of the Maya houses in Yucatan, "they have beds of small rods and on top a basket-work sevillo mat on which they sleep covering themselves with their mantas of cotton. In sum mer they usually sleep in the [front, open] whitened part of the house, on one of those mats, especially the men" (Tozzer 1941:86-88). This description of a barbacoa, or stick-platform bed, seems to match the one penned by our friar author, as do those in var ious other colonial-period sources. José de Gálvez, who paid an official visit to Yucatan in 1765-1766, described the typical Yu catecan bed as being "the ground or a framework supported by four poles" (Scholes et al. 1938:111:20). When important Span ish colonials (e.g., high-ranking officials and bishops) paid in spection visits to outlying areas in the peninsula, the native population was often ordered to build these barbacoa platforms for the visitors. Water transport (165-172) The description of the "great wedge of canoes" omits all details of the vessels themselves. Despite frequent references to Itza ca noes elsewhere in the documentary record, Spanish reporters provided us with few details about their appearance. Their re ports do indicate, however, that the Itzas possessed at least two types of canoes: large ones used for transporting high-level of ficials and for carrying archers who mounted defensive attacks, and small ones used primarily for fishing and, presumably, transporting daily small numbers of people around the lake. The larger ones reportedly held as many as 40 men and the smaller ones 7-8 persons (Amesqueta 1696:Folio 24r). The wedge-shaped formation of canoes described by our au thor was clearly intended to signal the notable's military sup port. A similar formation apparently greeted Avendaño and his party on his later visit in January 1696. On that occasion, a con siderably less hospitable one than that described in the present document, Avendaño reported that in answer to the messenger I sent earlier to the petty King of ray coming to his territory, there arrived some eight canoes, full of Indians, painted and dressed for war with very large quivers of arrows (though all were left in the canoes) —all the canoes escorting and accompanying the petty King who with about five hundred Indians came forward to receive us. They hurried us on board with great speed and with very rude ac tions. . . . (Avendaño y Loyola 1987:30) Avendafio's propensity to exaggerate aside, a simple calculation of these numbers results in about 60 armed men per canoe. As suming that his count of "some eight canoes" was correct and that an earlier report of canoes capable of transporting 40 men was also correct, we can reconstruct the 1696 military guard at about 320 men. Large canoes have long been known from early postcontact description, including that by Columbus, of sea faring vessels along the eastern coast of Yucatan, Belize, and Honduras (Jones 1989:39; Roys 1972:3, 13). It is surprising, nonetheless, to find them in the possession of the inland Itzas. The wedge-shaped formation described in this document, probably a semicircle with Canek's especially large canoe at the center front, was the mirror image of a standard Itza military maneuver. During the Spanish galeota's siege of Noh Peten (the Itza name for Lake Peten Itza's main island, which the Span iards called Tah Itza) on March 13, 1697, this defensive forma tion was described as a "half moon" that expanded into a circle, surrounding the waterbased attackers: "Those in the canoes were joining their forces from various locations on the main land, creating with great diligence a half moon, and closing it with a circle at the shore, and from various places they began to fire arrows" (Cabos y oficiales de guerra 1697:Folio 32v). General Ursua y Arismendi reported that this half-moon for mation appeared around the stern of his attack vessel as it neared the island (Ursua y Arismendi 1697:Folios 631v-632r). The strategy, tragically unsuccessful against Spanish firearms, was to prevent the galeota's retreat and to reinforce the Itza de fense forces on the island by encircling the galeota's bow and shooting at its occupants at close range. Although the number of canoes in this maneuver was not recorded, armed Itzas re portedly arrived on the mainland in more than 300 canoes — presumably both large and small —in an attack against Spaniards from Yucatan in 1696 (Testimonies 1696). Such fig ures are, however, very likely to be greatly exaggerated. Unlike the vessels in all other descriptions of Itza canoe for mations, the "great wedge of canoes" that accompanied Canek was decorated with flowers, and the nonpaddling passengers were playing musical instruments. Although the author makes no mention of bows and arrows in their possession, he later noted (22-25) that those who came in the canoes and who con tinued to play their instruments as they formed an honor guard for Canek were "Maya soldiers." We must therefore conclude that they were also well armed and that the Tipuans who re garded their fellow passengers with "a very great panic and greater fear" (49) as they travelled across the lake were well jus tified in their concern for their lives. A partial image of vessels quite likely to resemble those that bore Canek and his party can also be derived from the very lim ited number of canoe representations in Maya three-dimensional and two-dimensional art. Canoe models in manatee bone have been recovered at Moho Cay (McKillop 1980:208, Figure 79) and Altun Ha in Belize (Pendergast 1979:138, Figure 46b), and a pottery version is known from Lamanai, Belize. Tikal has yielded representations of canoes laden with animal and other deities as well as priests (Trik 1963:Figures 3-7). Canoes are also depicted at Chichen Itza in the famous "fishing village" mural from the Temple of the Warriors (Morris, Chariot, and Mor ris 1931:Plate 159), and are shown, paddled by various Chacs, in the Dresden Codex (Thompson 1972:83, 96, 99, 105, 106; Co dex Folios 36b, 40a, 40c, 43c, 65b).</page><page sequence="3">Material culture in the Canek Manuscript 283 With the exception of the Lamanai specimen, all the canoe representations are of dates moderately or considerably earlier than the vessels that bore Canek and his retinue to their meet ing with the Spaniards (for a discussion of Maya canoes in these earlier times, see Hammond 1981a). The Lamanai pottery model comes from the core of the platform of the first Span ish church at the site, and hence is fairly likely to have been manufactured in the first half of the sixteenth century, either before or just after the first Spanish arrival at the site, in about 1544. The similarities between the Lamanai specimen and the Classic models and carved depictions indicates conservativism in form that very probably extended into the seventeenth century. All of the models and at least three of the Tikal carvings show canoes with flat bow and stern and a limited amount of freeboard. The Chichen painting depicts a projecting bow and stern that appear to have curved upper surfaces, and both ends of the boats rise well above the gunwale line. The Dresden de pictions are generally too stylized to permit specific comparison, but in all cases a profile generally similar to that of the models and Tikal carvings is indicated. The Tikal depictions show that the flat areas served as seats for paddlers; one of the Dresden paintings (Folio 43c) suggests similar use of the stern, but the others compress the canoe too greatly to allow judgment on this point. The Chichen painting departs from the remainder in showing a single paddler standing at the front of the boat, be hind the raised bow. No models of paddles are known in Maya archaeology. The Tikal carvings show, in all but one case, an unusual form in which the round-shouldered blade lies entirely at one side of the plane of the shaft. The paddle could apparently be held with the blade either forward or back, depending on water conditions or the paddler's preference. The lone departure from this form (Trik 1963:Figure 5) appears to have a leaf-shaped blade cen tered on a shaft somewhat shorter than the standard for the other form. The Dresden paintings portray three blade types: elongated-leaf shaped, with rounded shoulders and sharply pointed tip (Folio 65c); tapering, with squared shoulders (Fo lios 36b, 40a, 40c); and oval (Folio 43c). Shafts in all cases ap pear to have about the same lengths as the Tikal examples. The Chichen mural boatmen wield paddles with pointed oval blades and the long shafts necessitated by the paddler's standing po sition. Because the Canek Manuscript's author failed to men tion paddle form, as well as the number of paddlers and the position used, we cannot choose among the depictions in seek ing to clothe the scene in more detail than the words provide. Musical instruments (Folio 5:168-169; Folio 6:23-25) The text, which indicates that the Itza honor guard were play ing "music with sticks [palos] and with drums and wooden flutes [xorombas]," seems to suggest that the sticks and drums were separate instruments and not that drums were struck with sticks. The music with sticks may have involved use of rasps, which in earlier times were not infrequently made of bone (see, e.g., Pendergast 1990:186, Figure 88). They may, however, have been rattles similar to those used ceremonially by the Lacan dones at the turn of this century, described and illustrated by Tozzer (1907:75, Figure 19): The Lacandone ceremonial rattle (soot) . . . is composed of a round gourd through which there runs a wooden stick. . . . At the top, the end of the stick is held in place by a knob of copal gum. The other end of the stick serves as the center of the handle, and is surrounded by six or eight slender reeds, the upper ends of which pierce the gourd in a circle around the center hole where the main handle enters. These reeds are bound around the handle by a winding of bark, and the ends of the strips of bark hang down in thirteen streamers from the lower part of the composite handle. The term "drum" embraces so many differences in form, construction, and material that one cannot envision the specific features of the instruments played aboard Canek's flotilla. We are, however, on reasonably solid ground in guessing that the drums (tunkul) were of a form sufficiently familiar to the writer that he was not moved to comment on their unusual qualities. This probably means that the instruments were hollowed sec tions of log either left open ended or fitted with heads of skin. Landa described "little drums which they play with the hand, and another drum made of hollow wood with a heavy and sad sound. They beat it with rather a long stick with a certain gum from a tree at the end of it . . (cited in Tozzer 1941:93).1 At least one of these types was used during mass in the Merida ca thedral in 1695 when an Itza delegation was presented for bap tism (Carvajal Campo Frío 1695a, 1695b). Both may have remained in use during the seventeenth century, but of course neither leaves direct archaeological traces. Drums played ear lier in this century at Chan Kom in Yucatan (Redfield and Villa R. 1934:154) and at Xcacal Guardia (Villa Rojas 1945:Plate 5b) were apparently of European-derived form, and we cannot rule out the possibility of European influences on late-seventeenth century Itza drums and other musical instruments. Headed pottery drums were in use from Classic times (Ham mond 1972a; Pendergast 1990:Figure 108) through at least the fourteenth century, when they are sometimes in the form of two joined complex cylinders (Pendergast 1982:Figure 9c). A type reminiscent of Classic forms, composed of a single tube with different end diameters and a central enlargement (Pendergast 1982:Figure 9e), was also known during this period and may have persisted in use until 1450 or later. The absence of such forms in Spanish-period contexts at both Tipu (Elizabeth Graham, personal communication 1991) and Lamanai seems to indicate that the long-lived tradition of ceramic drum making had died out in some areas before Canek's time. The Lacandon were, however, still making these instruments, decorated with faces, early in this century (Tozzer 1907:63, 74, 97, 111, Plate 20, Figure 2; for published references to Maya drums, see Toz zer 1941:92). The "xorombas" (churumbelas) were a type of wind instru ment, defined in a modern dictionary as "Instrumento de viento parecido a la chirimía, pero más pequeño" ("A wind instrument similar to the chirimía but smaller") (VOX 1982:509). The Eu ropean term chirimía refers to a double-reed instrument, today the oboe (VOX 1982:500); another dictionary, however, de scribes the churumbela as resembling a flageolet, usually a type of soprano recorder (Peers et al. 1968:290). Landa stated that 'Herrera's description of drums and other musical instruments in Yucatan, translated by Tozzer (1941:218), is clearly drawn from Landa's own text.</page><page sequence="4">284 Pendergast and Jones the Mayas of Yucatan used "whistles made of the leg bones of deer . . . and flutes made of reeds . . (Tozzer 1941:93). Toz zer reported (and illustrated) that the Lacandon still used an in strument with a quill "reed" early in this century: A very interesting form of reed oboe ... is used quite exten sively among the Lacandones. The mouthpiece consists of a quill inserted in the end of the hollow reed. The opening where the sound is produced is built up and surrounded by a mass of pitch. There are five finger holes. This flute is of ten used as a ceremonial object and offered to the gods. In such a case red paint is placed around each of the finger holes. (Tozzer 1907:74-75; Plate XIV, Figure 3). We have no way of knowing whether the xorombas in question were reed instruments similar to those used by the Lacandon or a simple whistlelike stopped flute that resembled a small re corder. As in the case of drums, the chirimía was a common in strument used by the Spanish at this time; we therefore cannot determine whether the instrument was traditionally Maya or based on a European import.2 Reed wind instruments are not known in the archaeological material record. Tubular multistop flutes with a resonating chamber and elaborate flared ends are, however, known in pot tery from Terminal Classic contexts (Healy 1988; Pendergast and Graham 1981:19; see Hammond 1972b, for discussion of earlier examples) and also from the twelfth century or later at Lamanai. The one-word description of the xorombas in the Canek document does not allow us to assume that they were similar in decorative design to the zoomorphic (generally, bird effigy) and anthropomorphic ocarinalike ceramic instruments that were still in use at Lamanai, and probably elsewhere, in the first quarter of the seventeenth century and possibly later. The tubular whistle has a long history in Maya music, but was gen erally of bone rather than pottery in earlier times; archaeolog ical evidence suggests that by the seventeenth century pottery had given way entirely to wood in the manufacture of this type of instrument. Canek's crown and gold jewelry (Folio 6:1-7) The author's identification of Canek's crown and other royal jewelry as gold raises a major question regarding Itza metals, both in the seventeenth century and earlier. After his subsequent visit to Noh Peten in 1696 Avendaño wrote There must be mines in the environs of this nation of the Yt zaes, because most of the Indians (in some large ear-drops they use) wear roses of silver hanging down, and others of silver and gold, and as the Spaniards do not come to this na tion, nor the Indians of this Province of Yucatán nor of the other provinces, because they are afraid of them, I do not know where they could get this gold and silver unless they took it from some mine. (Avendaño y Loyola 1987:47, our translation; this text appears almost verbatim in Avendafio's official testimony [Avendaño y Loyola 1696b]) Only one other Spaniard to our knowledge, reporting nearly a decade after the 1697 conquest, also observed gold jewelry among the Itzas and assumed that there must have been mines in the region (Ursua y Arismendi 1708). Most Spanish reports of jewelry refer to gifts of earrings presented to Itza women by Spaniards; earrings are among the European artifact inventory at Tipu, but are of silver rather than gold (Graham 1991:328). The crown presented in 1695 by the supposed Itza emissary of Canek, Ah Chan, to officials of Yucatan was said to belong to Canek. It, apparently like two others presented to Avendaño by Canek in 1696, was, however, made of feathers —similar in style, presumably, to the priestly feather "corozas" described by Landa (Avendaño y Loyola 1696b:Folio 30r-v; Recibimiento del indio Ah Chan 1695; Tozzer 1941:105; Ursua y Arismendi 1696; Villagutierre Soto-Mayor 1933:306). Although a large quantity of gold artifacts was recovered from the Cenote of Sacrifice at Chichen Itza (Coggins and Shane 1984; Lothrop 1952:28-73, 94-105), archaeological in vestigation to date suggests that very little was in the possession of rulers, nobles, or other members of the elite in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century communities farther to the south. Unfortu nately, we are unable to speculate beyond the words of the text about the form or design of Canek's "large crown of pure gold with a crest of gold," his gold ear disks with long pendant hang ings, his gold armbands, and his gold finger rings. The small inventory of southern lowlands gold artifacts in cludes a pair of gold, turquoise, and obsidian ear ornaments, each with six pendent gold bells, from a burial in a Postclassic structure at the northern Belize border site of Santa Rita (Chase and Chase 1988:56, Figure 30). A Late Postclassic (fifteenth cen tury?) intrusive deposit at the nearby site of Cerros contained gold and tumbaga objects (Garber 1989:93), and an apparently Early Postclassic (a.d. 1000-1250) burial intruded into a Clas sic structure at El Pozito, north of Lamanai, yielded a single gold bell (Gallenkamp and Johnson 1985:223). Investigation of Middle and Late Postclassic royal and noble burials at the larger site of Lamanai revealed, however, only sheet gold that once covered wooden objects (Pendergast 1981:48). The latest noble or royal interment at the site, clearly of sixteenth-century date, contained no gold whatsoever (Pendergast 1984). Pedro de Alvarado reported seeing during Cortés's expedi tion, in a temple at a town one league from Cozumel, a small chest containing "some diadems, idols, beads, and little pen dants of poor-quality gold" (Diaz del Castillo 1977:95, our translation). Torquemada wrote that the Mayas of Yucatan wore gold and silver jewelry in their ears, noses, and lips (Tor quemada 1723:14, Chapter XXIV, cited in Tozzer 1941:88, n. 372). Spaniards also suspected that in the early sixteenth cen tury the elite rulers of Chetumal possessed gold. In 1531 they found a reported 1,000 pesos worth of the mineral at Chequita quil, the refuge town to which these elite individuals had fled (Jones 1989:33). Even in light of these few discoveries, however, the conclusion is inescapable that resident populations in the southern Maya Lowlands knew gold only as a rare material, if they knew it at all, throughout the Postclassic and the early Spanish period. In view of the archaeological and ethnohistorical data we suggest three equally plausible explanations for the description of Canek's gold ornaments. The crown, ear ornaments, arm and finger rings, and sandal fittings (bells, perhaps?) may indeed have been of gold, in which case it would be most likely that the objects had been brought by the Itzas from northern Yucatan, where they might previously have been retained for a consider 2See Seler (1899:2:695-703) for a discussion of flutes and other mu sical instruments depicted in the codices.</page><page sequence="5">Material culture ¡n the Canek Manuscript 285 able period as royal raiment. The crown, ear ornaments, and arm rings might, however, have been wholly or partly of wood or other material sheathed in gold, and some or all could have been assembled or manufactured locally following the establish ment of Noh Peten. Finally, all of the metal might have been the West Mexican high tin bronze that when freshly cast, and probably when repolished, has the appearance of gold (Hosier 1988:850). If of bronze, Canek's finery could have reached the southern Lowlands among the considerable variety of artifacts imported into the southern Lowlands in Postclassic times (Chase and Chase 1988:56; Garber 1989:93; Pendergast 1981:47-48). Canek's cotton clothing (Folio 6:8-18) The author was impressed by the fineness of Canek's cotton clothing, from his tunic and the cape worn over it, to his sash and sandals. From the description we envision a man clothed in a long, white shirt-length tunic with blue designs, belted at the waist by a wide black sash. Blue symbolized his royal rank and black his priestly status. As if to reinforce the power of color symbolism, the author also cites the black clothing of the Chacan priests (28-29). If Canek wore a loincloth or undergar ment, it is unmentioned, perhaps because it was covered by the tunic. Over the tunic he wore a white cape with blue flecks and a blue border, decorated with three large glyphs. The only other items of clothing mentioned are his "very fine sandals . . . made of blue thread with many gold jingles." Canek's presence must have been impressive, not only because of the brightness and pu rity of the colors and his gold or goldlike jewelry but also be cause of his self-described corpulence (Ximénez 1973:211). Few early colonial descriptions of Yucatec Maya elite cloth ing have survived. Those that exist render an image only slightly different from that of Canek in his tunic, cloak, sash, and san dals. Landa stated that a man's clothing consisted only of a dec orated loincloth ("a band of the width of the hand, which served them for drawers and breeches"), a cape or manta made of square cloth and tied over the shoulders, and sandals of hene quen or deerskin (Tozzer 1941:89). The Relación of Valladolid describes a jacket (xicol [xicul, a shirt or jacket, Barrera Vásquez et al. 1980:943]) made of cot ton and feathers that might have been more like the "túnico" worn by Canek (Garza et al. 1983:2:40). Anawalt (1984:178) suggested that such tunics were equivalent to the xicolli of con quest-period central Mexico. The Aztecs used the xicolli "only as a special-purpose ritual garment; it was never worn as daily apparel." In Yucatan, however, the jacket, as well as the cape fastened at the shoulder, was a regular part of male costume; this manner of dress, as described in the Relación of Kizil and Sitilpech, could have been similar to that described for Canek: The costume that they commonly wore in this land was that the men covered their private parts with some bands made of cotton that they wrap many times around the body; they wore a small, sleeveless, multi-colored cotton jacket and some light mantas that served as capes with a knot at the shoulder. . . . (Garza et al. 1983:1:201, our translation) Avendaño described a similar jacket or tunic worn by the Itzas: They clothe themselves with something like jackets with half sleeves, and all from top to bottom woven at intervals with stripes of various designs and incorporated into the same woof—very lovely to look at. And with the elegantly or namented clothes they always paint themselves red and black. (Avendaño y Loyola 1987:48) Their cloaks, Avendaño wrote, they also wore for warmth at night; he described them as "sheets woven of various stripes and designs of different colors ..." (Avendaño y Loyola 1987:48). From this description we see that the blue designs and borders of Canek's clothing were probably not "embroidered," as the author maintained, but rather woven into the fabric itself, just as contemporary weavers incorporate designs into fabrics created by means of backstrap looms in highland Guatemala and Chiapas. Canek's cape was of course itself a mark of royal status, given further demonstration by the insignia of three glyphs, presumably at the front, as well as by the color of the designs and borders. One of the glyphs has been identified from the drawing that accompanies the author's description as God C, often depicted in Classic Maya inscriptions on the loincloths of important personages (William M. Ringle, personal commu nication 1991). The color used in decorating Canek's cape re calls the symbolism embodied in Aztec royal capes, which bore as an integral feature a step-fret design in blue or blue-green, a color that signified royal Toltec descent (Anawalt 1990). The identification of Canek's black sash with his priestly sta tus is of considerable interest. Several secondary sources on the Aztec such as Bray (1987:178) and Soustelle (1961:133) state un equivocally, without reference to primary documentation, that priests wore black or dark green mantles or cloaks, and Bray among others ascribed black body painting to priests as well. Close checking of the principal primary source regarding Az tec costume shows, however, that black capes as well as other black-ornamented paraphernalia were donned by priests specif ically for times of fasting (Sahagún 1979:62-63), a color link that also existed among the Maya of Yucatan (Tozzer 1941:152, 161). The Aztec practices of anointing the body with black and painting the face with soot or black rubber involved, on the other hand, either images of deities or human representatives of certain gods (Sahagún 1970:7, 9, 37, 46). Hence the relation ship of black to priestly duties among the Aztec is apparent, but the function of the color as an identifier of priestly status is not. Ascription of such a function to the color in the Canek Manu script is therefore intriguing, especially in view of the assertion (Tozzer 1941:89) that blue body painting was the mark of priests in Yucatan. The fabric of Canek's clothing was surely the best grade of the cotton cloth produced by the Itza, which even below the level of noble costume was regarded by Spaniards as remark ably high in quality. Immediately following the 1697 conquest, General Ursua y Arismendi wrote of "the great exquisiteness of the cotton weavings, their fineness and dyes" (Ursua y Aris mendi 1697:Folio 633r). A Dominican friar from Guatemala re ported in 1699 that he had seen "cotton from which the Indian women weave extraordinary and exquisite white and colored weavings and other things" (Artiga 1699:Folio 85r). It is thus not surprising that Canek's ambassador to Mérida in 1695 car ried examples of this cloth, woven by Itza women, for the Span ish to see. Avendaño reported that the Itzas bartered their cotton cloth, which they dyed with cochineal and indigo, with their Cehach neighbors to the north in return for hatchets and machetes: "and all this woven very neatly in a variety of colors of cotton thread; and the said clothing is very durable, since it is like felt, although the colors of their cloth are not very per</page><page sequence="6">286 Pendergast and Jones manent, from their not knowing how to give it the finishing touch" (Avendaflo y Loyola 1987:42). The description of Canek's blue footgear also suggests a fine ness that, like the color, denoted the wearer's royal rank. The thread used in the manufacture of the sandals was surely of cot ton, if one takes the writer's term "finas" to embrace quality of workmanship as well as impressiveness of appearance. The fact that the sandals bore many metal ornaments demonstrates that the king's footwear was complex in structure, and probably in cluded at least the high heelguard seen in some Postclassic sculp tural representations of royalty. The mat along which Canek walked from his canoe, and at the sides of which his retainers stood while he passed, is most likely to have been made of palm leaves. The text does not sug gest that he sat on a chair positioned at the end of the mat but rather implies that he stood facing forward, receiving first the Chacan priests and then the three Franciscans. The mat would have probably been laid out in an east-west direction so as to proceed dramatically along the path that his canoes had pursued "from the direction of the rising sun" (166). Canek's baton (Folio 6:26-28) Next there is Canek's tubular stone baton, a form apparently unknown in stone in Postclassic contexts but possibly repre sented in bone in a fifteenth-century Lamanai burial (Pender gast 1981:Figure 23). Objects generally similar to the Lamanai specimen have been identified as fan handles (Clemency Cog gins, personal communication 1985). The description leaves no doubt that the tube served as an insignia of rank just as fans are believed to have done (Hammond 1981 b:79; but see Benson 1982a, 1982b, and Hammond 1982). In fact, Canek presented Avendaflo on the latter's 1696 visit with two (presumably feather) crowns and a fan, clearly intended as symbols of his sta tus as a ruler (Avendaflo y Loyola 1696b:Folio 30r-v). The men tion of feather decorations on Canek's baton undoubtedly supplies the missing element in archaeological specimens, which are marked by numerous perforations that must have been for attachment of just such adornment. Feathers, according to Landa, also decorated the chasubles or batons of Yucatecan priests (Tozzer 1941:105). Canek's guest house (Folio 7:63-66) The Franciscans —and possibly the ten Tipuans as well —were given lodging in "a very large house that is his and that is very close to the large house of the family of Canek." The family, we are informed, included Canek's two sons and two daugh ters—all unmarried and presumably of marriageable age, as oth erwise the adjective would have been superfluous. We assume that his children and his wife, who is known to have borne the name Chan Pana, dwelt in the same house as Canek, located ad jacent to or very near the building in which he lodged his guests. On Avendaflo's 1696 visit the friar and his companions were greeted and housed by Canek half a block's distance from the lakeshore in a "hall which the King or Ah Canek has as a ves tibule to his house, in which he receives his guests as he did us . . (Avendaflo y Loyola 1987:34).3 In both cases, then, the friars were housed in a building next to the one in which we assume Canek and his family lived. The same building surely served as the guest house on both occasions. Avendaño stated that the building in which they were housed in 1696 was "of the same workmanship" as the nine principal temples on the island. These temples were very large buildings, made in the form of the churches of this Province [of Yucatan] — all new, with traces of others which had been burned, although they built them again, as I saw in the case of two which had been rebuilt.4 All such struc tures have a wall about a yard [vara] and half high and of the thickness of . . . [six-fourths]5; the bench or seat all around, which stands out from the middle inwards, is three quarters [of a vara] thick and the rest, which stands out above, is three-quarters thick, so that both together form two rows of seats around the said churches, all repainted and pol ished. (Avendaño y Loyola 1987:34) Avendaño went on to describe the interior of the building in which he and the other visitors were housed in 1696 and from which he carried on his missionizing activities. Unique in hav ing a polished floor, this building had at its entrance "a large stone table more than two yards [varas] long and proportion ally broad, placed on stone columns, with twelve seats of the same around it for the priests" (1987:34). Avendaño believed that on this table the Itzas practiced human sacrifice. Ever fear ful and suspicious, the friar seemed to have missed the obvious fact that it was a public meeting hall, open to crowds of peo ple who pressed around the strange visitors and cut off the only light through the single door, leaving the place in darkness (see also Rice 1986:313). From these descriptions alone we can draw the conclusion that the two buildings described in the text being considered here were part of Canek's compound, which we know from other sources was only one of several elite compounds —possibly as many as 22—tightly packed on the small island. We assume that these compounds, parcialidades (a term that implies political subdivisions) in the Spanish documentary sources, comprised three or more buildings arranged around a quadrangular open space. Such arrangements are well known at Mayapan and in Peten Postclassic sites (Proskouriakoff 1962; Rice 1986:309 316). Both the design and the functions of individual buildings themselves may, however, have changed considerably at Noh Peten by the late seventeenth century from the open-hall /.-shaped and C-shaped structures of earlier times. A full description of the town plan of Noh Peten, which can be partially reconstructed from various contemporary sources, is beyond the scope of this article, as is also an analysis of the political significance of this plan and the overall settlement pat tern of the capital (such a reconstruction by Jones will appear in a future publication). Food (Folio 7:74-77) The meal provided by Canek for his guests — an assortment of fowls, fruit, tortillas, and black beans—is as interesting for what it seems to have lacked as for what it comprised. There is no 3 The Bowditch-Rivera translation is in error in translating "media cuadra," or half a block (Avendaño y Loyola 1696a:f. 29r), as "half a quarter of a league" (Avendaño y Loyola 1987:32). 4The island capital had been burned in an attack by Canek's ene mies the Couohs a short time earlier, perhaps just before Avendaño's first visit. 5That is, they were 1.5 varas (about 1.5 yards) thick. The published translation from which this text is taken (Avendaño y Loyola 1987:34) incorrectly translates the Spanish original as "six quarters."</page><page sequence="7">Material culture in the Canek Manuscript 287 mention of drink, perhaps simply an oversight on the writer's part, and no mention of chiles, possibly because they were so common that no record of their presence seemed necessary. It is the absence of large game that is most striking; one might have expected venison or peccary if the guests were to be hon ored. Replacement of large game with birds might therefore have been a social statement — unrecognizable to the friars, of course —but it might equally well have been a reflection of re source realities in seventeenth-century Peten. Idols and temples (Folio 8:87-97) The phrasing regarding idols is standard for the Spanish colo nial period, but its ubiquitousness does not render it any less frustrating; "large" and "loathsome" (95-96) are scarcely the stuff of material culture reconstruction. The only "idol" known to have been described in any detail for this period at Noh Peten was publicly displayed in an open area near Canek's residence. This same figure must have been in full view of the author of the present document. Avendaño described it as a fragment of a column of round stone, the circumference of each part of which is about three quarters of a yard across and one quarter high. It is made of stones placed on top of each other with mortar of lime and cah cab [fah cab in the original, Avendaño y Loyola 1696a:29r], which is usually used for that purpose; the middle is filled in with bitumen so it is like a table, with a round pedestal upon which and set in the foundation of the said stone column there stands out toward the west a stone mask, very ill-formed, which, to gether with the stone column the petty King and the rest of his family and followers worship. (Avendaño y Loyola 1987:32) Avendaño, anxious to find evidence of Christian elements in Itza religion, claimed that the column (which, he said, the Itzas called "yax cheel cab," [referring, clearly, to the yax che, or ceiba tree] represented the tree "of whose fruit our first father Adam ate, who in their language is called Ixanóm" [Oxanom in the original, Avendaño y Loyola 1696a:29v], Carrying the idea further, he stated that the Itzas gave the title "son of the very wise God" to the mask, which bore the name "Ahcocáhmut" (Avendaño y Loyola 1987:32). The possible relationship be tween this masked stone column and other Maya iconographic forms can only be mentioned here —for example, Landa's de scriptions of four stone objects called acantun ("set-up stone pil lars" [Thompson 1972:91]), which were placed at the four entrances of the village during the uayeb ceremonies (Tozzer 1941:137-147); the apparent equivalence of these objects to "stone trees" (from signs reading te'-tun), stelae associated with uayeb rituals in the Dresden Codex (Scheie and Stuart 1985); and crosses in the form of serpent plants, associated at Palenque with the Quadripartite God, the God C Sun God, and dynastic blood symbolism (Stuart 1988:198-203). Of related interest is the possible significance of the representation of God C on Canek's cape as regards both the sun symbolism articulated in the Canek Manuscript and Canek's often purported association with human sacrifice. In addition to the masked stone column, Avendaño noted "a statue of a man made of stone and lime, situated on the top of a hillock, which they call Kinchilcobá, who they say is their watchman and sentinel who defends them against all misfor tunes which can happen to them." This "statue" was almost cer tainly a stela, very likely one of the two Postclassic stelae excavated in 1977 near the front of the church in Flores (Chase 1983:1074). As for the "many other public idols" that he claimed were found in the "priests' houses and streets ... I do not speak, so as not to trouble the reader" (Avendaño y Loyola 1987:33). Other large idols may well be discovered some day on the is land of Flores. If, however, such idols were present in precon tact sixteenth-century southern Lowlands communities, the absence of archaeological examples indicates that they either were of perishable construction or were systematically destroyed under Spanish supervision. Excavations have yielded fragments of larger than lifesize human/deity faces, but they may be from censers rather than complete figures. Portable deity figurines were a relatively common element in the material culture inven tory until Christianity took hold, and even then they were far from unknown (Graham 1991:324). How one longs for just a bit of description of the Noh Peten idols, so that some sort of limited comparison with their smaller counterparts could be made! Other Spanish sources have left no descriptions of any of the idols found at Noh Peten. Text written under the supervision of General Martín de Ursua y Arismendi immediately after the storming of the island capital is representative of the depictions of such religious representations: "And his lordship (Ursua), be ginning with the two priests to break idols, ordered that we do it with all the people, which [idols] in [their] hideous deformity and number we cannot comprehend . . . (Cabos y oficiales de guerra 1697:Folio 34r). Like Avendaño, these and other Span ish writers of the period profess to have been too horrified to describe Maya religious objects. Religious conversion and burial practices (Folio 8:98-113) The friars' initial success in converting children (100-101) sug gests a motivation for the policy applied throughout the Yuca tan Peninsula that gave children a special place in church ritual (Peñalosa 1969:70). It may also bear heavily on interpretation of data from Spanish-period cemeteries in Maya communities, such as those at Tipu and Lamanai. The distribution of grave goods among Tipu burials indicates a favored position for chil dren (Graham 1991:328), but evidence does not point to the ex istence of a special children's section in the burial ground, such as was in use in the missions of La Florida (Jones and Shapiro 1990:502). At Lamanai the frequency of children is notably low in the Spanish-period burial sample recovered to date, a fact that suggests the presence of a yet undiscovered children's cem etery (Pendergast 1991:350). The glimmer of light on the dy namics of conversion shed by the Canek Manuscript is, despite its diminutive size, a welcome addition to our minuscule store of knowledge about this highly important process in Lowland Maya colonial life. DISCUSSION The Manuscript's Author The attitudes toward material culture manifested in the Canek Manuscript take on particular interest if we accept, however ten tatively, the premise that Brother Alonso de Vargas was the manuscript's author. If Vargas was a Yucatecan mestizo or a Maya whose maternal language was Mayan, one would expect him to be reasonably familiar with his people and their mate</page><page sequence="8">288 Pendergast and Jones rial culture. The document makes it abundantly clear, however, that the author saw the way of life of Canek and his people as foreign. The writer's failure to provide details on some items of material culture such as canoes may, as previously suggested, indicate his familiarity with commonplace objects. By and large, though, his description of Canek's regalia and his mentions of other items of material culture bespeak unfamiliarity; he sees the culture through the eyes of one who shares little if anything with its bearers. The presentation of Itza material life as exotic might be ad duced as evidence that the writer was in fact foreign born rather than Yucatecan. It is equally likely, however, that the gulf be tween the Itza and their chronicler is a measure of the cultural distance that had existed for centuries between the northern part of the peninsula and the southern frontier. That distance was increased by Spanish urban development in the north while the south lay almost entirely beyond the pale, and it was augmented still further by the passage of more than a century and a half since Spanish arrival in the Maya area. Finally, if the writer was indeed a person of native extraction who adopted a Spanish sur name in order to ally himself with his Spanish confreres, the gap may have been given additional width by his conscious attempt to separate himself from the traditions of his ancestors. Taken together, these several factors seem to give the account much the same quality— if not the content — that it would pos sess if it had been written by someone whose roots lay in the Old World rather than the New. But nothing in writings by Iberian observers displays the striking gap seen in this document be tween a nonchalant disregard of certain material details and a startling degree of engagement with others. The author is clearly hispanicized in his conscious avoidance of physical descriptions of forbidden objects, especially "idols," which he denigrates in Spanish style as works of the devil. His failure to describe other objects such as buildings and canoes may have been, as previ ously suggested, the result of his discovery that these contrasted little with objects already familiar to him. In the exceptional case of Canek's costume, we are struck less by the detail of his de scriptions than by their dramatic imagery —an indication that the author was "blinded" to certain mundane details by his emo tive reaction to the combined attributes of Canek's person. Spaniards of this place and period did not display such reac tions, but instead apparently regarded the trappings of pagan charisma as equal to the idols themselves in their personifica tion of anti-Christian evil. Hence in his awestruck enthusiasm for the person of Canek, the author clearly distanced himself from everyday European modes of expression. The Value of the Manuscript to Colonial Period Archaeology and Ethnohistory The archaeologist, hungry for information with which to flesh out early colonial Maya culture as it is represented in the earth, cannot help but remain optimistic about ethnohistoric sources as an aid to the endeavor. Although the optimism is not always given a great deal of justification by the data yield, the archae ologist will continue to wring everything possible from the written word. The product of such squeezing of the Canek Manuscript is generally more frustrating than satisfying, but de spite the limitations of the manuscript, our analysis does man age to contribute to a better understanding of Maya material culture in the late seventeenth century. How much greater that contribution might have been is something one can dimly per ceive by comparing the archaeological record with the written one. Such comparison is of value if for no other reason than its placement of shadowy players on the archaeological stage. In the end, the Canek Manuscript's greatest value for the archae ologist lies in its promise that there must be others of its kind somewhere, awaiting discovery. This belief should sustain our optimism; it is, after all, what keeps us digging. The ethnohistorian, while sharing the archaeologist's hope that other such unusual documents will one day surface, must for now regard the Canek Manuscript in its broader significance as a unique example of a previously unknown genre among the thousands of primary sources on colonial-period Lowland Maya populations, especially those on the Itzas themselves. The mys terious author has evoked a new image of the Itzas that, while shedding frustratingly little empirical light on Itza culture, al ludes through the richness of his expressive powers to the au tonomy of that culture from the colonized Mayan-speaking populations elsewhere in the Lowlands. It would be a mistake to romanticize the Itzas as an intact survival of Precolumbian times, but ongoing ethnohistorical research continues to reveal that these central Peten populations were far more traditionally Maya and far more independent from the effects of Spanish colonialism than we once imagined. The clarity with which the Canek Manuscript so strikingly portrays the essential otherness of the Itzas focuses our growing realization that the dozens of Spanish observers saw little in the lives of these foreign pagans that they understood or knew how —or, for that matter, cared — to describe. The author's imagery and his profound reactions to Itza culture inevitably transform our vision of these people, requiring new readings of other sources whose style, content, and meaning are more familiar.
