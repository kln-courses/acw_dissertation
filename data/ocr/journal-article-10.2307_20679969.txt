William Carlos Williams The first line of Virgil's first eclogue: Tityre, tu patulae recubans sub tegminefagi, has laid out the most influential version of the pastoral scene in the Western cultural tradition1. E. R. Curtius 's caveat that ? anyone unfa miliar with that short poem lacks one key to the literary tradition of Europe ? is no hyperbole, if one considers that ?from the first century of the Empire to the time of Goethe, all study of Latin literature began with the first eclogue ?2. Within the trademark setting of the genre (the topos of arbore sub quadam, the shade protecting from the noonday sun, the crystal stream flowing nearby), our investigation focuses on the posture of the shepherd, which we identify by drawing on both the literary and the iconographie tra dition: only by doing so, we believe, Curtius's insight may be supple mented, and the snapshot by which Virgil captured his shepherd for cen turies to come as ? reclining (recubans)? may be freed from its monumental stillness. Rather than a static pose, the pastoral posture then reveals itself as a ? motionless gesture?3, a continuum of transformations capable of both the comic and the tragic register.

Virgil's shepherds are placed in an idealized landscape that he directly inherited from the master of Greek bucolic poetry. The posture, as well, of Virgil's Tityrus is modeled on that of the herdsman Comatas in Theocritus's seventh idyll6, who is posthumously addressed by a shepherd, also named Tityrus, and fondly remembered as he did ? lie (katek?kliso) and make sweet music under the oaks or pines ? (VII.88-89)7. In the first idyll, on the other hand, the shepherd Thyrsis envisages an alternative situation as he invites his interlocutor, an unnamed goatherd, to ? sit down (kathixas) and pipe, here, where is this sloping knoll and the tamarisks ? (1.12-13) ; an invitation the goatherd echoes shortly thereafter: ?let us sit (hesd?metha) beneath the elm, facing Priapus and the springs ? (1.21-22). It is thus Comatas's posture that Virgil reproduces and places promi nently at the threshold of his book when he describes the singing and piping herdsman as ? reclining ?: ?You, Tityrus, reclining under your spreading beech's covertytune woodland musings on a delicate reed (Tityre, tu patulae recubans sub tegmine fagi/siluestrem tenui Musam meditaris auena)? (1.1-2). Tityrus is ?lazing in the shade (lentus in umbra)?, as he ?make[s] woods resound with lovely Amaryllis ? (I.4-5)8. Later, the exiled Meliboeus 4 Egloga 1.1 (according to the ed.

(I.75-77)9. In the earliest modern example of bucolic poetry, Dante's first eclogue, the standard pastoral setting is replicated but no attention is paid to the pos ture of the two shepherds, Tityrus and Meliboeus, who are simply engaged in singing under an oak tree10; whereas Boccaccio, in his Buccolicum car men, revisits the genre in a more systematic manner. He does not overlook the posture of the singers, but describes it in terms that are closely molded on Virgil's example: the opening lines of two of his eclogues explicitly recall the reclining (recubans) posture, and one of them creates an adroit pastiche straight out of the three lines we have already quoted from Virgil's first eclogue : Pamphyle, tu patrio recubas hic lentus in antro [...] ? (III. 1 )11. Petrarch, on the other hand, makes a conscious effort to appropriate and transform the Virgilian model. While in his fourth eclogue the gift of poetry - in the semblance of a melodious ?lyre (cithara)? - is bestowed upon Tirrenus as he is sitting in the shade of ? age-old beeches ? (annosas inter considere fagos, IV.19-21)12, in the sixth eclogue he forces together in an together: Cur non, Mopse, boni quoniam conuenimus ambo,/tu calamos inflare leuis, ego dicere uersusjhic corylis mixtas inter consedimus ulmos? (V.l-3). On the meaning of umbra cf. Peter L. Smith, ?Lentus in umbra: A Symbolic Pattern in Vergil's Eclogues?, Phoenix 19 (1965) 298-304. 9 Stevens probably recovers the term from Virgil: ?On her side, reclining on her elbow/This mechanism, this apparition/Suppose we call it Projection A? (?So-And-So Reclining on Her Couch?, 11. 1-3). 10 ? Numbering our well-fed goats, as herdsmen do/Melibeus, my young friend, and I were beneath the oak (Forte recensentes pastas de more capellas/tunc ego sub quercu meus et Melibeus eramus)? and: ?I sang such things, as I was beneath the oak/with Meliboeus (Talia sub quercu Melibeus et ipse canebam)? (II.3-4, 67) ; quite distinct is the scene in Dante's second eclogue, where Tityrus lies dozing while Alphesiboeus leans on his staff : ?And, while their sheep and goats/reposed themselves upon the woodland grass /their nostrils sniffing every faintest air/Tityrus, freighted with his many years/and with the drowsy odors, dozed a while/protected by a maple's youthful shade (Et dum silvestri pecudes mixteque Capelle/insidunt herbe, dum naribus aera captant,/Tityrus - hic anno sus enim - defensus acernalfronde soporifero gravis incumbebat odori)?

Bergin (New Haven, Yale UP 1974).</page><page sequence="4">38 MASSIMO SCALABRINI and DAVIDE STIMILO hendiadys the two postures that, as we have seen, up to this point had been kept carefully apart: he describes the posture of the shepherd, for the first time, as both ? sitting ? and ? lying supine?, a solution that thus erases the intermediate ? reclining ? posture: ?I sit and lie on my back (Sedeo iaceoque supinus) here/singing the songs love bids me and taking no thought for the morrow ?13. Petrarch's departure from Virgil's phrasing is an instance of the stylistic variatio that he consistently tried to achieve vis-? vis his models ; in all likelihood, however, it also entails an implicit criticism of Virgil's ambivalent usage of the term in the Aeneid. The shepherd's reclining is indeed identical to that of the bone-gnawing Cerberus14, but, even more arrestingly, to that of the suckling sow, whose climactic appear ance on the shores of the river Tiber - first announced in Helenus's prophecy and then confirmed by the river-god Tiberinus himself in Aeneas's dream - signals the end of the hero's toils and marks the place where the city of Alba will rise : litoreis ingens inuenta sub ilicibus sus triginta capitum fetus enixa iacebit, alba solo recubans, albi circum ubera nati, is locus urbis erit, requies ea certa laborum15. Petrarch's hendiadys thus humanizes a stance that in Virgil indifferently becomes humans and animals, and by his very choice of words the humanist poet amends what he must have regarded as an inappropriate contamination of stylistic registers on Virgil's part. Petrarch's innovation is echoed, in the late fifteenth century, by the Man tuan poet Battista Spagnoli, whose eclogues were ?a standard textbook in sixteenth-century schools ? and were then ?as famous as? Virgil's16. The shepherd is resting in the shade of a tree that is the silent witness to his love's labors17; there, as a youth, and precisely like Petrarch's shepherd, he had 13 Sedeo iaceoque supinusjmulta canens que dict?t amor, nec crastina cur ans (VI .78-79; trans. Bergin, slightly modified). Strikingly, the only occurrence of the term in Petrarch is in Epistole metrice, 1.6.23 (in Poesie latine, eds. Guido Martellotti and Enrico Bianchi [Torino, Einaudi 1976]) : Quid ve Helicone iuvat recubantem sepe profundo, a line that is more closely reminiscent of Propertius's Virgilian incipit: Visus er am molli r ecubans Heliconis in umbra (III.3.1). 14 ?These realms huge Cerberus makes ring with his triple-throated baying, his monstrous bulk crouching in a cavern opposite (Cerberus haec ingens latratu regna trifauci/per sonat aduerso recubans immanis in antro)?', ? the warder of Hell, as he lay on half-gnawn bones in his bloody cave (ianitor Orci/ossa super recubans antro semesa cruento)? (ken. VI.417-418 and VIII.296-297). 15 ? you find a sow lying under the oaks on the shore, just delivered of a litter of thirty young, a white mother reclining on the ground, and white the young at her teats - there shall be the city's site, there a sure rest from your toils ? (Aen. Ill.390-393, cf. also Aen. VIII.42-46). 16 Paul Alpers, What is Pastoral? (Chicago, U of Chicago 1996) 175. 17 ? This place, this very tree beneath which we are resting, knows with what cares I sighed, with what fires I burned ?

(sedi iacuique supinus) while brooding over his forlorn con dition (mea tristia fata revolvens)1*. Further evidence of the impact of Petrarch's reformulation on humanist poetry is provided by Martino Filetico's choice of re supinus as a rendition of Greek katek?kliso in his ver sion of Theocritus's idylls : ut nostras molliter aureslmulceres numeris grata resupinus in umbra19; and, even more tellingly, by the emphasis Cristoforo Landino sought to achieve by juxtaposing resupina to recubans in a line of his book of elegies Xandra, which portrays Oenon lamenting the absence of her beloved Paris while recubans resupina sub antro (II.7.47)20. The parody with which Folengo opens his macaronic book (Egl. 1.1-2) : ?You alone, Bigolinus, lying stravacatus in the shade, similar to a wether chewing fresh grass (Tu solus, Bigoline, iacens stravacatus in umbrajcas troni similis te?eras cum masticai herbas)?21 is therefore aimed, more than at the incipit of Virgil's first eclogue, at a pastoral posture that, as we have seen, was being redefined in the wake of Petrarch's challenge to Virgil's authority22. The elusiveness of the term recubans is already proven by the periphrases to which all later poets had to resort - with the exception of those who quote Vir gil verbatim, such as Boethius (vasto recubans in antro)23 or Boccaccio: everybody else joins to the verb lacere a qualifier, be it Virgil's own lentus24 ingemui curis, quibus ignibus arsi)? (1.6-7) ; ed. and trans. Lee Piepho, Adulescentia : The Eclogues ofMantuan (New York, Garland 1989). 18 ?Here, when in my youth I followed the herd, I sat [...] and lay on my back, pondering my sad fate with many a sigh and tear (Hie ego [...]/[...] sedi iacuique supinus/cum gemitu et lacrimis mea tristiafata revolvens)?

Alessandro Perosa (Firenze, Olschki 1939). The coupling may also have been suggested by Lucretius's prominent use of the two terms to describe Mars's amorous posture in the invocation to Venus that opens the poem : ? as he lies back his breath hangs upon thy lips. There as he reclines, goddess, upon thy sacred body, do thou, bending upon him from above [...] (eque tuo pendei resupini spiritus oreJhunc tu, diva, tuo recuban tem corpore s?nct?lcircumfusa super [...]? (1.37-39). Recubans is a hapax in Lucretius. 21 Unless otherwise indicated, all translations are our own. Variations on the same verse can be found in Zan. 1169-1170 and Zan. V 980-981. 22 On the fortune of the pastoral topos cf. Curtius 183-202 ; cf. Annabel M.

(Talia Faesuleo lentus meditabar in antro)?', for a similar use of meditari see also Manto 111 ; Silvae, ed. and trans.

Undoubtedly, however, the sprawl (iacens stravacatus) of Bigolinus, who is straightforwardly compared to a chewing wether26, is meant to degrade the decorous pose (sedeo iaceoque supinus) of Petrarch's shepherd. Folengo borrows from contemporary rustic poetry in vernacular27 an epithet that in this new context adds immediate emphasis to the animal side of the comparison: the term stravacatus, which most likely derives from Latin *extravacuare ('to evacuate', 'to overflow', 'to pour out', 'to turn upside down') and is still used in a similar sense by his contempo raries28, acquires in the macaronic vocabulary perhaps for the first time the connotation that it retains nowadays in the Italian language and that was already codified, less than a century later, in John Florio's New World of Words: ?To commit or wallow in beastlinesse as a Cow, or beyond a Cow?29. By suggesting in such a way a popular etymology of the term, Folengo is at the same time able to recover Virgil's conflation of the human and the animal, which his reception had obliterated, as we have seen. The 25 ? For there [...] my bull loves to rest, as he reclines his great bulk in the cool shade ? (illic requiescere noster/taurus amai gelidaque iacet spatiosus in umbra)? ( . 15-16). 26 Attilio Momigliano describes the adjective as a ? deformazione [...] pittoresca ?: ? Basta questo verbo cos? massiccio e animalesco, per trasformare il pastore poeta in un grasso e sporco bovaro? (?Le quattro redazioni della Zanitonella?, Giornale storico della letter atura italiana 73 [1919] 4). 27 The earliest example we were able to find is in the Sonetti pavoni del codice Ottelio, prob ably by Giorgio Sommariva (ca. 1435-1502), where an unrequited lover is kicked by the lady he pursues and falls to the ground making the noise of a fallen carriage (che 7 parse stravac? l? zoso un caro, XI.8) ; Antiche rime venete (XIV-XVI sec), ed. Marisa Milani (Padova, Esedra 1997). See also Folengo's contemporaries Bartolomeo Cavassico, Rime, eds. Vittorio Cian and Carlo Salvioni, 2 vols. (Bologna 1893-1894), where the poet remembers how he used to sleep in the stable ? sprawled out? on the manure (Men sieve stravac?per quella broda, XIX.27), and, in his Poesie inedite III.149-154 (edited by Gio van Battista Pellegrini, Studi di dialettologia e filologia veneta [Pisa, Pacini 1977]), the appearance of a drunk peasant ? sprawled out ? on a bench like a pig, with his flask upside down and dead asleep (E Vera sun un scagn/but? come un por celi'e s? ?va el butacel/tut reversaJEl steva stravac?/che no'lpodeonfar vif); Angelo Beolco il Ruzante, Dialogo secondo (Bilor?), sc.

Giuseppe Tonna [Brescia, Grafo 1981]), where the rustie Gian lies all night ? sprawled out (stravac?t)? in front of the house of his beloved Togna. 28 This etimology of stravacatus (past participle of ' stravacare ' ) was first advocated by Gio vanni Flechia, ?Postille etimologiche, I (Continuazione e fine)?, Archivio glottologico italiano 3 (1878) 121-176, esp. 149-152.

Another measure of Folengo 's departure from the Virgilian tradition is gained by comparing even Calpurnius's ? spacious ? bull (taurus [...] iacet spatio sus in umbra)31 with the unprecedented and truly scandalous sprawl of his human characters. Folengo's radical revision does not only affect the posture, but all the other elements of the pastoral topos, as well32. We turn our attention next to the activity Virgil's shepherd is engaged in as he rests in the shade : he plays and sings, whereas Folengo 's Bigolinus indulges in what, in preliminary fashion, could be described as an incessant and unruly ? mulling over of fan tasies ?33. On the other hand, Virgil's choice of the verb meditari suggests far more than mere music-making. Nothing reminds us more of the measure and discipline that the pastoral ?m?ditation?34 imposes on the shepherds than their proximity to flowing (as opposed to stagnant) waters. A stream of clear water crosses the pastoral locus amoenus, and it is near a spring or a brook that the shepherd sings. In Theocritus's idylls, the herdsman Comatas will sing ?more pleasantly ? sitting ? beneath the wild olive and these trees ?, below which ? water drips cool ? (V.31 -33) ; Damoetas and Daphnis ?at a spring [...] sat down, in summer at noonday, and thus they sang? (VI.3-4) ; and Daphnis's ? couch ? lies ? by the cool stream ? in idyll IX.9. In Petrarch's Bucolicum carmen, Silvius remembers how Virgil himself used to sing near lake Benacus's crystalline offspring35; in turn Silvius sings 30 ?As soon as I happen to enter the stable, I seem to see her sprawled down between the cows [...] or the young steers [...]?. 31 See above, n. 25. 32 As Zaggia observes, the first and most obvious clue of Folengo 's parodie intention is the striking replacement of the shepherds' classical names with vernacular and realistic ones (Macaronee minori 8). 33 See below, pp. 48-49, n. 60. 34 Meditor is the frequentative form of medeor, cf. Alfred Ernout-Antoine Meillet, Diction naire ?tymologique de la langue latine (4th ed. ; Paris, Klincksieck 1959), ad voces. 35 ? Time was, the gentle Parthenias/(true, 't was a long time ago, in my boyhood) was wont to sing with me/there, where Benacus, made fair by crystalline waters transparent/sends forth an offspring like to itself (Dulcissimus olimiParthenias michi, iam puero, cantare solebatlhic, ubi Benacus, vitrea pulcherrimus alvojpersimilem natumfundit sibi)?

The contiguity of pastoral singing and streaming water can hardly be a matter of accidental proximity, and it is certainly not by coincidence that the spring and the river-flow have traditionally come to signify literary and poetic production38. In Theocritus, the song is likened to and indeed identi fied with the flow of waters. ? Sweeter? is the shepherd's song - in the first idyll - as it pours forth from his lips ?than yonder stream that tumbles splashing from the rocks? (I.7-8)39. Similarly, in the final lines of Virgil's third eclogue, Paleamon puts an end to the poetic competition between Menalcas and Damoetas by comparing their respective songs to thirst quenching ? streams ?: ? Shut off the streams ; the fields have drunk enough (Claudite iam riuos&gt; pueri ; sat prata biberunt)? (III. 1 11)40. When he writes, in a letter to his brother Gherardo, that ? the resounding springs can be taken to mean the lettered and eloquent people ?41, Petrarch is well aware of recall ing another ancient topos42, and it would be impossible to forget Dante's double identification - of Virgil with spring and eloquence with river - in Inf. 1.79-80: ?And are you then that Virgil, you the fountain/that freely 36 ibifons michi sepe carienti/plaudit (1.34-35). 37 nitidique in margine fontislsolus apollinea modulons sub fronde sedebo (VIII.124-125; trans. Bergin, slightly modified). 38 Cf. the enlightening references to Plato, Laws 719C : ? There is, o lawgiver, an ancient saying - constantly repeated by ourselves and endorsed by everyone else - that whenever a poet is seated on the Muses' tripod he is not in his senses, but resembles a fountain, which gives free course to the upward rush of water ?; and to a fragment of the playwright Cratinus (fr. 186K.) : ?Holy Apollo ! What a flood of rhyme './Founts plash, the lips vent twelve spouts at a time ;/the throat's Ilissus ; if no bung's applied /his poetry will swamp the countryside ? (The Fragments of Attic Comedy, ed. and trans. John Maxwell Edmonds, 4 vols. [Leiden, Brill 1957-1961]) in Wolfgang Kemp, ?Eine mantegneske Allegorie fur Mantua?, Pantheon 27 (1969) 14. 39 Alpers (What is Pastoral? 24) reads these lines as a sign of ? harmony between human and natural music ?. 40 See also V.45-47, where Mopsus's song is likened to ? a brook/of sparkling water, quench ing noontime thirst (quale per aestumi'dulc?s aquae saliente sitim restinguere riuo)?. 41 fontes sonantes literati et eloquentes homines dici possunt (Familiares .4.23) ; ed. Vit torio Rossi (Firenze, Sansoni 1933-1942). 42 In this passage the poet explains the allegorical meaning of 11. 8-10 of his first eclogue : ?Who leads you into such pathways ?/Who, pray, bids you ascend with so much painful exertion/lofty, unsealed mountain peaks, or to wander through desert wastelands/over moss-covered crags or where lonely cataracts thunder? (Quis vel inaccessum tanto sudore cacumen/montis adire iubet, vel per deserta vagari/muscososque situ scopulos fontesque sonantes?)?. Moreover, fans is how Homer is referred to again in 1.26. Velli discusses these passages in reference to ?a gloss to Vergil's Ambrosian Ms.? in which Petrarch ? explains Bucolica 1,52 Fontis sacros with the words Magistros ex quibus flu mina sunt?

(Or se' tu quel Virgilio e quella fonte/che spandi di parlar s? largo fiume?)?43 As he revisits the posture and the activity of the shepherd, Folengo is also redefining the landscape in which the shepherd is situated. It is already significant that, in his eclogues, the ubiquitous element of the flowing water is missing; elsewhere, in the Baldus, he refers to the Mantuan landscape as an unhealthy and swampy ? ditch ?, the fossa Cipadae, resounding of the cacophony of frogs and gnats44. It is even more significant that, when the poet and his heroes take leave from this rural setting in book XI of the epic, the ?better waters ? that he is bent on crossing are Virgil's own waters, those that moisten the banks of his birthplace, Pietole : Altius, o Musae, nos tollere vela bisognai mysterumque fach gravius distendere schenam. Usque modo calcavit aquas mea barca Cipadae, ranarum quae voce cridant redolentque lavacchium ; nunc mare Pietoli, quo non prigolosius altrum, trapassare volo, nulla ret?nente paura*5. The local character of this landscape is confirmed by a series of visual rep resentations that, in spite of their obscurity, are unquestionably meant as allegories of Mantua. They achieve their goal by lining up the mythical ancestors of the town, but also, and more importantly, by sketching an imag inary map of the region's hydrography. In the engraving by Girolamo Mocetto [fig. 1] that first exploits the motif, we see a nymph reclining on her right arm in the center of the image, propped up by an urn from which a stream is flowing into a pool of water. To her left is the figure of a seemingly detached Neptune, who, according to the mythographers, had just created a spring to fulfill Amymone's quest : she had been sent by her father Danaus to look for water, but had been surprised by sleep and threatened by a satyr, 43 Trans. Allen Mandelbaum (Berkeley, U of California 1980).

Thus far my boat has trodden the waters of Cipada, which croak with frogs and smell of mud ; but now, held back by no fear whatsoever, I want to cross the sea of Pietole, a sea more dangerous than any other ?

Neptune prevents her rape only to perform it in turn: the spring is a reward of sorts to soothe her for what she had to endure47. But that 46 The Mantuan allegories were clearly inspired by the second version of the myth narrated by Hyginus (CLXIX A), as it is the only one in which Amymone grows weary and falls asleep on her search for water (cf.

Ariadne and Others : Images of Sleep in Greek and Early Roman Art?, Classical Antiquity 4 [1985] 158). 47 quam deus amplexu votum persolvit ; at illilaurea divinas urna profudit aquas (Propertius II.26C.49-50). The scene takes place, according to Propertius, on the banks of the ?Ler nae palus? (48), whereas most writers take Amymone to be the very source of the Ler naean marsh (Apoll?d. II. 1.4; Strabo VIII.6.8; Hyginus CLXIX). According to later rationalizing interpretations of the myth, the multi-headed Hydra dispatched by Hercules represented the frequent overflowing of the marsh: cf. Sergio Casali, ?Hydra redund?ns (Ovid, Heroides 9.95)?, Classical Quarterly 43 (1993) 505-506. The painting of Amy mone that Philostratus included in his Imagines 1.8 represents only Poseidon's chase after her; the next (1.9) in the series, however, is almost a narrative of its aftermath, rather than a mere landscape, as Philostratus describes in minute details the image of a marsh (helos), from its vegetation of ? marsh-plants ? (? reeds and rushes ?, ? tamarisk and sedge ?) to its fauna of ? ducks ? and ? geese ? and ? long-legged birds with huge beaks ?, whose various attitudes are also carefully differentiated : ? one stands on a rock resting first one foot and then the other, one dries its feathers, one preens them, another has snatched some prey from the water, and yet another has bent its head to the land so as to feed on something there ?.

According to one inter preter48, the head is the severed head of her husband, whom she had mur dered, as all the fifty daughters of Danaus their respective husbands49; however, if we compare this image to a painting by the Mantegna follower Lorenzo Leonbruno, a pair of coins minted for Guglielmo Gonzaga, a lunette in the Palazzo del Te50, and the border of a Raphael tapestry in the Sixtine chapel51 that all take up the subject, it seems not unlikely that the head be actually that of Virgil himself. On the coins and the painting he is identified by name, and in the painting he is moreover feeding the pool along with his fellow Mantuan poet, Battista Spagnoli, whose popularity among his contemporaries could not be confirmed more eloquently than by such a juxtaposition : the two fountainheads of Mantuan poetry are repre sented as the literal sources of the waters that surround and protect Mantua breaking forth from the mountain sides; as they flow down and mingle their waters below, the plain becomes a marsh; not, however, a disordered marsh or the kind that is befouled with mud ; but the course of its waters is directed in the painting just as if nature, wise in all things, directed it, and the stream winds in many a tortuous meander, abound ing in parsley and suited for the voyaging of the water-fowl ?. Attention is then focussed on a scene, which, as we know, was actually painted for Isabella d'Este, marchesa of Mantua, by Pietro Perugino in the background of his Battle of Love and Chastity, ?the first Renaissance painting we know to quote from Philostratus ? (Jayne Anderson, ? Alle gories and Mythologies ?, in Bellini, Giorgione, Titian, and the Renaissance of Venetian Painting, eds. David Alan Brown and Sylvia Ferino-Pagden [New Haven, Yale UP 2006] 148) : that of the Cupids riding swans on waters that Philostratus calls ?the most beauti ful of the marsh, issuing direct from a spring ? and forming ? a swimming-pool of exceed ing beauty?. But the stupenduous and intricate play of the waters does not end here: ?behold, a river also issues from the marsh, a broad rippling stream, and goatherds and shepherds are crossing it on a bridge?. It is easily understandable how such a protracted bravura piece could appeal to a Mantuan audience, whose real landscape closely resem bled Philostratus's fictional one (see below, pp. 46-48). 48 Millard Meiss, ?

The lunette, attributed to Rinaldo Manto vano, represents the muse Urania, according to Egon Verheyen, The Palazzo del Te in Mantua : Images of Love and Politics (Baltimore, Johns Hopkins UP 1977) 114, who per suasively argues that the overall theme of the Loggia delle Muse, in which the lunette is located, is Mantua ?as an appropriate 'residence' for the Muses ?

In Raphael's cartoon, as Kemp remarks (15), the type of the sleeping Amymone has been replaced by that of the Vatican Ariadne (for which see below, pp. 52-54), who is, however, in this case unquestionably awake, as she welcomes Giovanni de' Medici to Mantua in her role as personification of the city.</page><page sequence="12">46 MASSIMO SCALABRINI and DAVIDE STIMILO along with the spring issuing from beneath the nymph, whose name is itself an epithet for the city, the ?immaculate (amymos)?

When Folengo, in the above-quoted passage, is defining the muddy quality of the waters that flood the Mantuan lowlands, he is not only distin guishing them from Virgil's own waters, onto which he wants to ? tres pass ?, but he is also subtly reminding the reader of the inexhaustible range of Virgil's poetry. At this point, the daring choice of a heavily vernacular term is not just meant to recast in macaronic terms the elusive posture of Virgil's shepherd, but also to evoke the stagnant waters that mar Folengo 's landscape : the term stravacatus conveys not only the animal analogy we 52 Cf.

In the first of his Sylvae, which is named after the prophet ess Manto, eponymous ancestor of the city of Mantua, Angelo Poliziano extols the virtues of Virgil's eloquence in the wake of a comparison he could find in Macrobius, but inscribing it into a uniquely Mantuan lay of the land. Dante's Virgil had seized the chance of Manto 's sighting among the diviners to rectify his own account of the origins of the city (Aen. X. 198-200): in doing so he had also provided a depiction of the real hydrography of the place down to its most minute details, which the visual representations we dis cussed above translated and markedly simplified in their allegorical lexicon : the river Mincius, shortly after ? falling out ? of the overflowing ? bosom ? of lake Benacus (ivi convien che tutto quanto caschi/ci? che 'n grembo a Benaco star non pu?, Inf. XX.73-74), ? sprawls out (si distende)?5* into a 56 Cf. the etymology of the name Mintius, from mitius ('more placid'), that Manto herself surmises in Pietro Bembo's etiological poem Sarca: [...] perspicuis labens et mollibus undis/assuetas leni gaudebit flumine ripas/lambere et innocuo per campos serpere lapsu/mitius, unde agris, qua sese infundet, ab ipso/Mintius eventu dicetur nomine ducto (463-467; ed. Otto Sch?nberger [W?rzburg, K?nigshausen &amp; Neumann 1994]). Manto makes her appearance at the nuptials between the river Sarca and the nymph Garda, from whom the future lake will take its name, and forecasts the greatness of Virgil's poetry, sprung, too, as it were, from those waters.</page><page sequence="14">48 MASSIMO SCALABRINI and DAVIDE STIMILO ? lowland (lama)? flooding it and turning it into a swamp (la 'mpaluda, 79 80). Only a piece of land is left above water, and Manto sets her eyes on it because of its isolated and fortified position that recommends it for human colonization: Quindi passando la vergine cruda vide terra, nel mezzo del pantano, sanza coltura e d'abitanti nuda. L?, per fuggire ogne consorzio umano, ristette con suoi servi afar sue arti, e visse, e vi lasci? suo corpo vano. Li uomini poi che 'ntorno erano sparti s'accolsero a quel loco, eh'era forte per lo pantan ch'avea da tutte parti51. Certainly Poliziano could not ignore this passage in a eulogy of Virgil titled after Manto, and Dante's influence may account for the local inflection that he supplies to Macrobius's analogy. Virgil's ? rich eloquence ?, which, along with Macrobius, Poliziano had previously compared to ? immense expanses of land and sea?, takes now on, in turn, the appearance of a ?torrent borne along by a powerful ?mpetus?, of a dried-out stream barely flowing at the bottom of a river bed, and of a river that ?now releases itself ?, and ?now after overflowing its bounds [...] hems itself in?58. It is to a similar ebb and flow that the imagination of Folengo's shepherd is prone, as he lies sprawled out. In a passage closely reminiscent of E gl. 1.1, Tonellus, another rustic character, is portrayed in a slightly different posture, this time ? crouched (colegatus)?, without any thought or care occupying his mind: Solus solettus stabam colegatus in umbra pascebamque meas virda per arva copras ; nulla travaiabant vodam pensiria mentem, nullaque cogebat cura gratare capul59. 57 ?And when she passed that way, the savage virgin/saw land along the middle of the swamp /unfilled and stripped of its inhabitants ./And there, to flee all human inter course/she halted with her slaves to ply her arts ;/and there she lived, there left her empty body ./And afterward, the people of those parts/collected at that place, because the marsh - /surrounding it on all sides - made it strong ? (Inf. XX .82-90). 58 Sic varios se se in vultus facundia dives I induit ; et vasto nunc torrens impete fertur/flumi nis in morem, sicco nunc aret in alveo./Nunc sese laxat, nunc exspatiata coercet (362 365). Cf. Saturnalia V.l .10 : Quisfons, quis torrens, quod mare totfluctibus quot hic uer bis inundavit? (we quote Macrobius according to James A. Willis's edition of the Saturnalia and the Commentarli in Somnium Scipionis, 2 vols. [2nd ed., Leipzig, Teubner 1970]). Francesco Bausi refers to Macrobius in his critical edition of the Silvae (Firenze, Olschki 1996) 43. 59 ?I was lying all alone crouched in the shade, as I put my goats out to pasture on green fields ; no thought was troubling my empty mind, and no care was making me scratch my head?

V 51-54; and, with slight variations, in Zan. 37-39.</page><page sequence="15">SOME RENAISSANCE VERSIONS OF PASTORAL 49 While Tonellus is clearly not engaged in any singing or piping, as his fellow inhabitants of the pastoral topos are eager to do, it would be a mistake to read his lack of action, his otium, as a mere negation of the activities that normally take place in the shade : whatever is happening here does not echo the regular cadence of flowing water, as Virgil's meditari implied, but is rather paced after the laborious and patient rumination of the flock in the midst of which he is lying. In other words, the model here is not the visible motion of the running water, but rather the secret transformation that is occurring in the digestive tract of the animal. It is only by, once again, reclaiming the animal-like nature of the shepherds' posture and activity that Folengo can endow them with the ability ?to mull over fantasies {fantasias animo subvolvere)?60 and to entertain the phantasia plus quam fantastica61 that is the ultimate source of his own macaronic voice. The only rhythm to which their ruminations are attuned is not that of running waters, but that of a river overflowing and then retreating within its banks. The hyperbole of phantasia plus quam fantastica aptly captures the exuberance of such a rhythm, although it is certainly not meant to advocate an idle play of the imagination. After making an appearance in the incipit of what is arguably his first macaronic text, as well as in the first two lines of his epic masterpiece,/?/ a - tasia returns crucially at the end of that very poem, where the heroes find themselves in a state of spiritual stupor and physical weightlessness (Baldus XXV.422 ff.), as they end up in a cave, described as ?full of quiet noise, a silent buzz, a still movement, a confused order, a norm with neither rule nor art (completa silentilmurmure, vel tacito strepitu, motuque manenti Jordine confuso y norma sine regula et arte)? (476-478). It is the House of Fantasy, within which ? unbridled phantoms, dreams of a crazy mind, thoughts guided by no reason float around freely (undique phantasmae volitante ani mique balordi!somnia, penseri nulla ratione movesti)? (479-480). As they are pushed out of this uninhabitable caverna (567), they temporarily regain their gravity and senses, only to enter a nearby, even more grotesque machina (600), which reveals itself as a huge pumpkin (zucca), the dwelling place of those responsible for such monstruous creations. This stanza (608) the macaronic poet recognizes as his true home (zucca mihi patria est, 649), the natural place to which his levitas and vanitas craved all along to return: sic leve cum levibus meschientur vanaque vanis (626). But the zucca is also 60 ?what fantasies are you mulling over in your mind? (quas fantasias animo subvolvis adessum?)? (Egl. 1.3) ; this is the question Bigolinus has to answer as he lies stravaca tus in umbra. 61 ? A fantasy, more fantastic than ever, has come to me : to sing with the fat Muses the story of Baldo (Phantasia mihi plus quam fantastica venit/historiam Baldi grassis cantare Camoenis)? (Baldus 1.1-2).</page><page sequence="16">50 MASSIMO SCALABRINI and DAVIDE STIMILO the very head in which Tonellus is revolving his own fantasies : quas phan tasias per zuccam volvis adessum? (Zan. V 982) Only such a paradoxical space, at the same time uniquely individual and universally human, could contain and restrain the fantasies in which Folengo's shepherds are never tired of indulging - and thereby save them from the danger of getting lost in the ?vast field of imaginations? against which Montaigne warned in his essay Of Idlenesse62. The figure of Folengo 's stravacatus rests thus on a straightforward ani mal comparison, but also on a more elaborate set of analogies with over flowing waters. At one point, Folengo goes even thus far as to compare the posture to the spreading of manure : iam non ira quidem stravacatur more ledammi63. When Virgil casts his singing shepherd in the reclining position he describes as recubans, on the other hand, he is relying on a visual formula that, by his time, had already become commonplace, and was used to repre sent humans and gods alike : as we know from Pliny (Nat. Hist. XXXV99), the Greek term anapauomenai was used as an abbreviation for a genre of semi-recumbent female figures so familiar to contemporary audiences that poets such as Propertius and Ovid would imagine their beloved lying in bed in the pose of an Ariadne, an Andromeda, or a maenad64. This widely known formula rests, in turn, on the reclining posture of the spring-nymphs and river-gods, although its appeal is largely predicated on the erasure of any trace of such genealogy. The Greek term itself was already applied by Plato to describe a posture that occurs in unquestionably pastoral surroundings and that is most suited to the activity in which the interlocutors of his dia 62 We quote John Florio's translation, The Essayes, or Morali, Politike and Millitarie Dis courses (London 1603). 63 ? wrath is certainly not spread out like manure ? (Egl. 11.35 ; and, with a slight modifi cation, Zan. 971). A similar comparison occurs in the passage from Ruzante quoted above, .27. 64 Cf. Propertius 1.3.1-6: ?Like the maid of Cnossus as in a swoon she lay on the deserted shore when Theseus' ship sailed away ; like Cepheus' daughter Andromeda as she rested in her first slumber on her release from the rugged cliff; no less like the Thracian bac chant, exhausted after incessant dances, when she collapses on the grassy bank of the Apidanus (Qualis Thesea iacuit cedente carina!languida desertis Cnosia litoribus;/ qualis et accubuit primo Cepheia somno/libera iam duris cotibus Andromede ;lnec minus assiduis Edonis fessa choreis/qualis in herboso concidit Apidano)?; Ovid, Amores 1.14.19-22 : ? Often, too, in early morning, when her hair was not yet dressed, she has lain half supine on her purple couch. Even then, in her neglect, she was comely, like a Thra cian Bacchante lying careless and wearied on the green turf (saepe etiam nondum digest?s mane capillislpurpureo iacuit semisupina toro Jtum quoque erat neclecta decens, ut Threcia Bacche,/cum temere in viridi gramine lassa iacei)?.

The landscape is reminiscent of the ? charming resting place? that is the setting of the conversation between Socrates and Phaedrus and that Socrates takes to be ? a sacred place of some nymphs and of Achelous, judging by the figurines and statues ? (Phaedr. 230C)66. That the divinity of the place be vouched for by the presence of these idols is not without Socratic irony; on the other hand, if one were to take literally the prayer Phaedrus addresses to them at the end of the dialogue (279B-C), they could only be imagined in the reclining posture that visual artists had elaborated long before the flourishing of Greek anthropomorphic sculpture. The archaic version of the formula featured the vase as the container from which the flow of waters was issuing, a motif that we have already encountered in the Mantuan allegories we discussed above : The subject of the vase from which streams of water bubble up and overflow on each side is so intimately connected with that of the god from whose body streams gush forth that in reality they form an indissoluble whole, a single conception, that of the beneficent deity who pours the waters of life and fertility upon man and nature. The flowing vase is merely an abbreviated symbol of the more complete composition, an outward and visible sign of the wondrous bles sings bestowed by the divine munificence67. Deprived of the attribute of the vase, the reclining figure becomes liable to different interpretations. Once the vase and the divinity were separated, the posture by itself remained to signify the flowing that before was openly illustrated by the streaming waters. The association of the reclining posture with the divinities who preside over bodies of water may thus provide the ultimate reason for the posture of Virgil's shepherd. It is therefore not at all surprising to find in the pastoral context of The ocritus's first idyll both an invitation to the nymphs, that they may watch over the music-making, and a reference to their visible presence (1.12-14, 21-22). But they are hardly a prerogative of a specific poetic genre: ?from Homer to the late epigrams in the Greek Anthology, nymphs are consistently the inhabitants of water sources and providers of fresh water?68, and this 65 Cf. Phyllis Pray Bober, ?The Cory ciana and the Nymph Corycia?, Journal of the War burg and CourtauldInstitutes 40 (1977) 238. 66 Roger Caillois compares and contrasts the landscape of the Phaedrus and that of The ocritus's first idyll in Les d?mons de midi ([Saint-Cl?ment-la-Rivi?re]: Fata Morgana 1991)57. 67 E.

In Boccaccio's encyclopedic Genealogie Deorum gentilium (VII. 14), for instance, the nymph is identified as the ? generic name of all kinds of humors and humidi ties (Nynphe generale nomen est quarumcunque humiditatum)?69', the nymphs are then classified according to their specific sites of influence, and those presiding over the Castalius fans are identified with the Muses. In the chapter specifically devoted to them, Boccaccio advances moreover an unlikely etymology for their special name that is, interestingly enough, based upon the biblical etymology of the name Moyses and ties them again to the humid element: Nec non arbitror Musas a moys, quod est aqua, dic tas (XI .2). Such insights are consistent with the erudition of an ancient anti quarian such as Dionysius of Halikarnassos, who vouches that each natural place has a divinity, be it a god or a genius (dairnon), appropriate to it, and that ? meadows and verdant places? are particularly suited to the nymphs (1.38.1). As a more recent interpreter puts it: ?Some of these spots were unmarked places in the wild, but more often there was minimal cultivation and improvement on nature: the p?g?, or spring, in its natural state might become a kr?n?, a 'fountain' with a basin or cistern ?70. This transformation of a natural topos in a cultural tropos, so to speak, is also typical of the early Renaissance, as a number of scholars have shown in retracing the humanist habit of placing a fountain in a literary garden. Most often these fountains are watched over by a reclining female figure, who is, however, mostly asleep, hence cannot keep guard, is rather a bystander, or just another element in the landscape: as has been proven, the insertion of this element in the Renaissance garden is the result of a misconstruction, the copy of a prototype that was believed to represent the dying Cleopatra until she was identified as the abandoned Ariadne in the early nineteenth century [fig. 3]71. What is most relevant to our argument is the pseudo-classical inscription that was used to justify the juxtaposition of statue and fountain, and that presented the nymph as asleep : ?

The conceit of the sleeping nymph addressing the passerby already exposes the inscription as epigonal, if not a straightforward forgery : for the nymphs are ? sleepless (akoim?toi)?, as Theocritus unequivocally states (XIII .44)73 - their sleep 72 huius nympha loci sacri custodia fontisldormio dum blandae sentio murmur aquae/parce meum quisqu?s tang?s caua marmora somnumlrumper e siue bibas siue lauere tace (Cor pus Inscriptionum Latinarum VI/5,3*e, trans.

The epigram has been attributed either to Michele Ferrarmi or to Giovanni Campani (cf. MacDougall, ?The Sleeping Nymph ?, 358), until ?gnes Rito?k-Szalay, ?Nympha super ripam Danubii?, Irodalomt?rt?neti K?zlem?nyek 87 (1983) 67-74, sug gested that the epigram was actually transcribed in Hungary by the Veronese antiquarian Felice Feliciani.

Matsche (182-183) goes even further and iden tifies the model of Cranach's nymphs (see below, pp. 54-56) with a no longer extant relief that the artist could have seen in Buda. 73 Her identification as a ? sleeping nymph ?, which Winckelmann had authoritatively endorsed at the end of the eighteenth century, could be dismissed already on this ground, rather than on those given by Ennio Quirino Visconti in 1819 when he first labeled her as Ariadne (the name by which the Vatican statue is still known) : namely, that she has too many clothes on and her expression is too melancholy (the paraphrasis is Barkan's, 388).</page><page sequence="20">54 MASSIMO SCALABRINI and DAVIDE STIMILO lessness a natural reflection of the spring water's inhexaustible gushing forth74. The nymph could become a figure among others in the pastoral land scape, and hence be subject to sleep like her human counterparts, only once she ceased to be identified with the spring that she was, and not merely rep resented. One may argue that the inscription, if taken at face-value, begs forgive ness for what is a dereliction of duty, as it were, on the part of the nymph. The first line of the inscription, in other words, should be read as a conces sive clause: ?Even if I am the custodian of the place, I sleep, rather than keeping wake, as I should ?. Like Amymone in search of the spring that she will become, the nymph is first surprised by sleep and then, as a conse quence, in her sleep by an assailant, who forces himself upon her, or by a spectator, who witnesses her awakening75. Whatever the outcome, it is the pregnant moment before she is discovered that Lucas Cranach has insight fully illustrated in a series of paintings [fig. 4], while adopting a shorter ver sion of the inscription : ? I am the nymph of the sacred spring. Do not disturb my peace for I am at rest (fontis nympha sacri somnum ne rumpe qui 74 Cf. Servius 's gloss to Virgil 'sflumine vivo, which he identifies as ? augurale verbum ? (Ad Aen. 2.719) : semper fluenti, id est naturali (quoted in Louise Adams Holland, Janus and the Bridge, Papers and Monographs of the American Academy in Rome 21 [1961] 6). Cf. also Holland's enlightening comment that ?from the religious point of view the volume of a stream is without interest: the basis of its potency rests solely upon its being in the augural sense 'living water'?. 75 Cf. Bark?n's sustained remarks on the role of the beholder vis-?-vis the reclining female (but also male) figure (233-247). A number of interpreters, most recently Jayne Anderson (Giorgione: The Painter of 'Poetic Brevity' [New York, Rammarion 1997] 217) and Carlo Ginzburg (? Die Venus von Giorgione : Ikonographische Innovationen und ihre Fol gen?, Vortr?ge aus dem Warburg-Haus, vol. 2 [Berlin, Akademie 1998] 1-38), have seen the origin of the Renaissance type in an actual voyeuristic scene, be it the profane one of Boccaccio's Cimone and Ephigenia, or the sacred one of Noah and his sons, whose rep resentations become allegories, as it were, of ?the transformation of aggression into awe ? (McNally 164) that leads to aesthetic contemplation (a process that is also traceable in the earliest depictions of satyrs pursuing maenads in Greek vase painting, McNally 155-165). These interpretations remain fundamentally indebted to Fritz Saxl's intuition (in the 1935 lecture ?Titian and Aretino?, Lectures, 2 vols. [London, Warburg Institute 1957] 1: 163) that Giorgione was able to create ?a new subject all'antica? with his reclining Venus precisely ?by eliminating the onlooker in the picture and making the spectator play his part?. But the safety of such vantage point is only apparent: ?in eter nal reprise the ravished ? may become ? ravishers ?, as Bober aptly puts it (232), in recall ing the ?tales of young shepherds like Hylas, Daphnis and Astakides?, who were lured and ? carried off to deathless existence in underground caverns ? by the nymphs. The ?one notable Renaissance predecessor ? of Giorgione's Venus (Meiss 213), Botticelli's Mars and Venus already problematizes at first sight the standard gender roles, as the reclining Venus turns to contemplate a slumbering Mars ; but the possibility that the paint ing (as persuasively suggested by Charles Dempsey, Inventing the Renaissance Putto [Chapel Hill, U of North Carolina 2001] 107-146) be the representation of an instance of ?nympholeptic possession? (141) and that Venus be actually a ?nympholectic phan tasm ? (145) haunting Mars's imagination sends further ripples across the apparently serene surface of the painting (on nympholepsy see below, p. 60).</page><page sequence="21">SOME RENAISSANCE VERSIONS OF PASTORAL 55 Figure 4: Lucas Cranach, the Elder (1472-1553), Reclining Water-Nymph, 1518, oil on panel, 59 92 cm, Museum der Bildenden K?nste, Leipzig (Photo Credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY) esco)?16. It is surprising that virtually no attention has been paid, so far as we can see, to a detail of such figures that is at least as telling as the crossing of their legs or the position of their elbows : namely, the opening of their eyes [fig. 5]77. Cranach's nymphs are certainly not meant to portray full sleep, but rather the ? motionless gesture? of falling asleep or waking up, the imper ceptible crossing of the threshold between conscience and dream78. In the tale of Rhea Silvia from Ovid's Fasti, which almost step by step reproduces 76 Cf. M. Liebman, ? On the Iconography of the Nymph of the Fountains by Lucas Cranach the Elder ?, Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 31 (1968) 434-437. The line was dictated by Matthias Corvinus himself, according to the 1585 Historia inclyti Matthiae Hunyadis r?gis Hung?ri?? by Thomasus Jordanus (cf. Rito?k-Szalay 67). There are at least fourteen extant versions of the spring nymph produced by Cranach and his workshop (Matsche 160). 77 Liebman (435) notices that the eyes are indeed open, but fails to draw any consequence out of this realization. Matsche (198-199) takes this detail as further proof that Cranach's nymphs cannot be based on an ancient model, ? since they do not sleep ?, whereas, pre cisely for this reason, they seem to us closer than any other Renaissance depiction to a truly ancient understanding of the nymph. 78 Birt argued in 1895, though he seems to have been the only one since, that even the Vati can Ariadne's eyes are not entirely closed, though her eye-lids have fallen (Birt 43). Cf. also Stephanus's correct interpretation of recubare as meaning ?toto corpore jacere, ita scilicet composito, ut facilius somnium capere possis? {ad vocem. Thesaurus Linguae Latin??

It is the languor before or after sleep, gravid of dangers and possibilities, that Cranach's nymphs are meant to portray. As the Roman antiquarians did not hesitate to recognize in the reclining female figure the features of the historical Cleopatra, Giulio Campagnola misidentified a river-god as Saturn and created thereby a new type of melan choly god, as opposed to the astrological image that prevailed in earlier times [fig. 6]. As one interpreter puts it, however, the striking novelty of Campagnola's representation of Saturn as a river-god, his ? unconventional manner of treating the subject ? is such that ?if 'SATVRNUS' were not inscribed on the rocks of the lower left, it would be difficult to identify the subject of the print as such?81, and it would have been difficult to contem 79 For other mythological examples of this pattern, perhaps most influentially represented in an engraving from the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, cf.

As MacDougall pointed out (?The Sleeping Nymph?, 358), the Huius nympha loci epigram is indebted to Ovid's lines. Cf. also the description of Ari adne's awakening in the Heroides (X.9-10): ?Half waking only and languid from sleep, I turned upon my side and put forth hands to clasp my Theseus (incertum vigilans ac somno languida movi/Thesea prensuras semisupina manus)?. 81 Clarice M.

An idealization such as that which Campagnola achieved with this figure was also, in all likelihood, the target of Folengo's parody, though in another medium. The interpretation championed by Klibansky, Panofsky, and Saxl goes ultimately back to Aby Warburg's pioneering reading of D?rer 's Melencolia I. In his essay ? Pagan-Antique Prophecy in Words and Images in the Age of Luther? (1920), he first proposed to consider the central figure of the engraving as ? a transposition of a reclining river god, with head supported on one hand?, identifying it through a comparison with the astrological depiction of the constellation El?danos : 82 Raymond Klibansky, Erwin Panofsky, and Fritz Saxl, Saturn and Melancholy : Studies in the History of Natural History, Religion, and Art (New York, Basic Books 1964) 211-212.</page><page sequence="24">58 MASSIMO SCALABRINI and DAVIDE STIMILO It is thus possible to regard Melencolia I, both in form and substance, as a sym bol of the humanistic Renaissance. It reanimates the pose of a river god in anti quity in the Hellenistic spirit, but behind it all is the new ideal of the liberating, conscious energy of the modern individual83. In later years, paradoxically, the ancient river-god became for Warburg, in conjunction with his interpretation of Manet's D?jeuner sur herbe, ?the embodiment of depression and passivity, the very opposite of the striding nymph?84: on April 3, 1929, he wrote in the journal of his library : ?The ecstatic 'Nympha' (manic) on the one side and the mourning river-god (depressive) on the other...?85, hence contradicting the glorifying interpreta tion of his earlier essay. At the same time, however, Warburg is also revers ing the polarity of the nymph, and he is doing so against his better knowl edge : in his 1893 dissertation on Botticelli, Warburg had himself noted that Pliny's earliest editors replaced the word aurae in the text, the meaning of which was presumably not clear to them, with the word nymphae*6. Hence he could hardly ignore that the nymph he recognized in the striding maid of Ghirlandaio 's fresco in the Cappella Tornabuoni87 is only a misnomer of the nymph proper. By casting the nymph in the pose of an aura, in other words, Warburg is equally responsible for a conceptual confusion that has had a considerable impact on the interpretation of the reclining figure. For the nymph, as custodian and personification, at once, of the source or spring, is par excellence reclining. The conclusion of what has been an inevitably sketchy overview of the literary and artistic history of a topos can only be problematic : the same posture, or pathos formula, to use Warburg's terminology, lends itself to both a comic degradation and a tragic sublimation in the Renaissance. It is Folengo 's great achievement to have produced the definitive parody of the pastoral stance; at the same time, his poems also provide an alternative 83 In The Renewal of Pagan Antiquity: Contributions to the Cultural History of the European Renaissance, trans.

It is almost as if the sprawled-out posture of the shepherd were the natural source of his reveries in a state of dormiveglia that is highly suited to the chiaroscuro of tragi comedy, the best generic term by which to label Folengo 's compositions. But the twilight between wakefulness and sleep should not be construed as a mere pause or relaxation : while fantasy is verging on the threshold of dream, it may fall prey to the folly induced by the nymphs, who frequently succumb to divine violence, but like, in turn, to take hold of the human mind, as is briefly the case of Socrates on the banks of the Ilyssus (Phaedr. 238C-D)89. It is a dangerous state out of which Virgil invites the singers to come, at the end of his eclogues : for the shadow has by then become a bur den (gravis) rather than a shelter to them90. The urge to rise negates at once the reclining position and demises the pastoral register in favor of higher poetic goals. As reinterpreted by Folengo, on the other hand, the pastoral mood thrives precisely in the stage of penombra. Its best visual equivalent is the carnivalesque and Utopian landscape of Pieter Bruegel's cockaigne, in which the poet, the only character awake, stares at the vault of the zucca with his semi-open eyes, both inwardly and outwardly contemplating the endless fantasies that crisscross his mind [figs. 7-8].
