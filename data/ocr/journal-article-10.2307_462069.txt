<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERBERT F. TUCKER, JR. Tennyson and the Measure of Doom It is necessary to respect the limits. An artist is one who recognizes bounds to his work as a necessity, and does not overflow illimitably to all extent about a matter. Tennyson to James Knowles I Y HE ACCOUNT that Tennyson gives of the way he wrote Maud in 1854-55, at the middle of his career, suggests something important about everything he wrote. Here is Aubrey de Vere's report: Its origin and composition were, as he described them, singular. He had accidentally lighted upon a poem of his own which begins, "O that 'twere pos- sible," and which had long before been published in a selected volume got up by Lord Northampton for the aid of a sick clergyman. It had struck him, in consequence, I think, of a suggestion made by Sir John Simeon, that, to render the poem fully in- telligible, a preceding one was necessary. He wrote it; the second poem too required a predecessor: and thus the whole poem was written, as it were, backwards.1 The backward genesis of an intricate work of over a thousand lines is indeed "singular," as de Vere says. The most singular thing, however, may be that the composition of Maud was not a freakish episode but a quite typical instance of Tennyson's approach to his art. His longest work, Idylls of the King (1885), an epic ma- tured during the course of forty years and more, proceeds from King Arthur's mysterious birth, through the rise and decline of Camelot, to Ar- thur's mysterious death. But it was the last idyll, "The Passing of Arthur," that came first, pub- lished in 1842 as the "Morte d'Arthur" and written nine years before that. While the parallel is not exact, we can say with some justice that in keying his epic to its foregone conclusion Ten- nyson wrote Idylls of the King backward, as he had written Maud. Likewise, he composed the elegies that make up In Memoriam (1850) over the better part of two decades; and as Chris- topher Ricks has observed, the resolutions of the poem, the easiest and most easeful lyrics, were those that came to Tennyson first. His leisurely expansion of a handful of elegies into a poem of major proportions was largely a backing and fill- ing maneuver-"if there were a blank space I would put in a poem"-that supplied prepara- tory complications as afterthoughts to the emo- tional stabilities they precede in the text we read today (Ricks, Tennyson 122; Martin 342).2 Perhaps to provide an emblem of this composi- tional process, Tennyson prefaced the finished poem with a prologue dated 1849, a retrospec- tive introduction that forecasts and summarizes the plot of the elegies that follow. The idea of a prefatory last word, an origin that serves a work as its goal, must be nearly as old as literate cul- ture. Yet In Memoriam so pervasively implies that "all, as in some piece of art, / Is toil cooper- ant to an end" (128.23-24) that the final vi- sion of "One far-off divine event / To which the whole creation moves" (Epilogue 143-44) seems to describe the creatively ordained evolu- tion of the poem, as well as the evolving uni- verse the poem has come to celebrate. Even when, to the best of our knowledge, the process of composition was straightforward, Tennyson delighted to enclose his poems in frames that give the illusion of retrospective re- turn. Sometimes, as in The Princess (1847) or "Aylmer's Field" (1864), a scene of narration opens and closes a poem whose narrated events recede into the mythic or historical past. Some- times, as in "Oenone," "The Hesperides," and "The Lotos-Eaters" (1832) or "Lucretius" (1868), a past-tense narrative preface embeds and distances the present urgency of lyric voice. Sometimes Tennyson more subtly introduces dramatic speeches like those of the title figures of "Ulysses" (1842), "Tithonus" (1860), and "Tiresias" (1885), who speak without media- tion in the present yet fill the present with their 8</page><page sequence="2">Herbert F. Tucker, Jr. longing to get back to an earlier state. More subtly still, even in such comparatively rare in- stances of naked lyric address as "Break, break, break" (1842), "The Eagle" (1851), "Flower in the crannied wall" (1869), and "Crossing the Bar" (1889), Tennyson's theme and imagery gravitate toward some inevitable ground in the power of God, the drift of nature, or the obses- sions of human nature. And for Tennyson, through an inextricable compounding of tem- perament and biographical accident, human na- ture itself usually involves a fixation on the past, on the days that are no more.3 Whether we inspect the circumstances of textual composition, then, or the emotional tex- ture of the verse, we find in Tennyson a poetry of aftermath. What drew him repeatedly to imagine terminal or retrospective lyric situa- tions, and also fostered his retrograde procedure in the composition of longer poems, was a fas- cination with inevitability. Although his was a century remarkable for its faith in progress and hope for the future-currents of the zeitgeist by which Tennyson could scarcely remain un- touched-his genius gave its real allegiance to an older and darker wisdom that discerns in the present the determining hand of the past. This allegiance may explain why in the private realm his poems yield well to a psychoanalysis of de- sire, why his public poems disclose a fatalist or teleological view of history, and why imitation and allusion form so large a part of his work.4 Tennyson prized the past as the temporal locus of a power more important to him than the past itself: the power of what cannot be changed. His poetry is a coming to terms with the inevitable, and to approach it as such is to appreciate the relation between the notes of helplessness and authority that produce its distinctive tone. The following remarks on Tennyson's handling of character, action, and atmosphere should illumi- nate the connections between his undeniable limitations and his great strengths; they should also prepare us to see how the shaggy mystic and the precise formalist in him can have consorted together so well. II Writing at the first crest of Tennyson's im- mense popularity, Matthew Arnold described as definitively modern those situations "in which there is everything to be endured, nothing to be done" (204). We might read into Arnold's criti- cism of his own Empedocles on Etna a sidelong glance at the works of his modern, all too mod- ern contemporary. There is something of an ethical vacuum in Tennyson's poetry. Tennyson is simply not very interested in investigating and assessing the interplay of motive and action, and those who seek primarily these things in poetry will not read him for long with much pleasure. Of course we find no shortage of moral exhorta- tion or argument in his public set pieces or in the Horatian mode he developed in the early 1830s, years before gaining the laureateship. But to set forth rules for conduct is not to imagine the eth- ical crisis, the awareness of other minds, and the resultant dramatic pressure of choice that have provided central themes for English poets of character from Chaucer onward. The interest of an absorbing poem like "The Two Voices" (1842) scarcely inheres in the drama of the modern psychomachia, though that is where Tennyson probably expected his readers to find it. The heavy reliance on generalizing epigram and illustrative emblem, the virtual absence of context, the ultimate passivity of the earnest yet bemused speaker before the injunctions of the voices he hears-all conspire against the cred- ible formation of character in a poem that seeks, after all, to render a character-forming crisis of faith. The "monodramatic" form of Maud, in contrast, makes a virtue of Tennyson's defects by dwelling on isolated moods and letting their serial juxtaposition do the work of dramatic development. The obvious comparison with his contem- porary Browning shows that, while Tennyson could create character and sustain its moods, he could not dramatize it beyond a relatively narrow range of internal and external action-a range of action that is most compelling, in fact, when it addresses those conditions or psychological mechanisms that thwart change. Conservative in most respects, Tennyson was nowhere more conservative than in a psychology that embraced the determination of character, either by the blood or by the unalterable early past. His speakers are notable for their lack of pluck: they exhibit determination rarely and suffer it often. Typically they come into voice after the fact, 9</page><page sequence="3">Tennyson and the Measure of Doom once some determining deed has been committed and the irrevocable consequences of that deed are making themselves felt. They bring to their postfactual situations a belated commentary, and it is the burden of Tennyson's unsurpassed rhetoric to persuade us of the validity of situa- tions for which belated commentary is all that can be offered.5 A conviction of inevitability as profound as Tennyson's spells the death of a certain kind of ethical curiosity. His speakers are responsive but not responsible, at least inasmuch as responsibil- ity implies the capacity for present or future ac- tion; and Tennyson makes them most convincing when he cleaves to his psychological conser- vatism and does not force them (the way he forces, say, Princess Ida) to transform them- selves. As Tennyson's characters are seldom responsible, so they are seldom guilty. Though we may understandably convict Mariana (1830) or Ulysses of serious crimes against themselves and against virtually anybody else who may impinge on their consciousness, we should also observe that Mariana and Ulysses do not experience guilt directly or practice the con- scious arts of self-justification. Instead they baffle their guilt, projecting it into a landscape from which it may return with alien, ominous authority. When for characters like Guinevere and Launcelot in the Idylls guilt is a given of the tale-that is, when for Tennyson as author the inevitable takes the authoritative shape of an- tique legend-the behavior of the characters is more revealing still. Guinevere and Launcelot, much like their poet, treat guilt as a given, and this acceptance of an uncontested guilt is the equivalent, in character, of Tennyson's odd nar- rative elision of the moments of their fall and redemption.6 Sometimes the drama of self-justification be- comes explicit, but then it also becomes unac- ceptably schematic. Tennyson knew as much when he created, in "St. Simeon Stylites" (1842), a character who substitutes a dogma of sin and atonement for any real grappling with a conviction of guilt; this monologue may provide the best character sketch anywhere in Tennyson, and, significantly, its subject is a characteristic evasion of guilt. (One can only wish that the poet's awareness of such tendencies toward ethi- cal abstractness had stayed with him, and stayed his hand, when he lent his support to King Ar- thur's formal and vacuous apologia in the elev- enth of the idylls.) Finally, the guilt-ridden sec- ond part of Maud may serve as an exception that not only proves the rule but also suggests why Tennyson clung to it elsewhere. Here for once a character confronts guilt without stay or prop, and madness is the result. Character itself dissolves into a welter of constituencies that can be brought to order only, it seems, through re- peated submission to the inevitable, or as the last words of the poem have it, "the purpose of God, and the doom assigned" (3.59). Tenny- son's career, I want to argue, makes sense as a series of just such submissions to an inevitable doom. Maud has been convincingly read as a poem a clef expressing obliquely the frustrations of Tennyson's earlier love life and of his familial and social position, but we might also approach it allegorically as a work rich with "autobio- graphical" significance for the poet as well as for the man.7 When there is everything to be endured and nothing to be done, endurance will be a leading virtue, the index of a speaker's strength will be the deepening stasis of a mood, and action itself will take the strictly subordinate place it takes in Tennyson's poetry. Critics who contend that Tennyson really couldn't tell a proper story have to contend first with the enormous success of "Enoch Arden" (1864), Idylls of the King, and other narratives among an audience whose au- thentic taste for moving narration Tennyson manifestly knew how to meet. Still, anyone who reads widely in Tennyson's collected works will know what such critics mean. There is some- thing about the stories he tells best, in their climactic emphasis on inhibition or in their diffuse sense of breakdown, that scandalizes the assumptions behind our critical metaphors of narrative "development" and "progression." Something opposes the thrust of narrative and deflects the poetry in an allegorical direction that has made readers since Walter Bagehot suspect that, whatever a Tennyson poem is ostensibly about, its real subject lies elsewhere (343).8 When undertaking an actual story, Tennyson consistently opts for descriptive over narrative effects, and even then he gives atmospheric or local description priority over physical descrip- tion of characters or analysis of their minds. (In 10</page><page sequence="4">Herbert F. Tucker, Jr. similar fashion, on the smallest scale, he gives adjectival and adverbial modifiers syntactic priority over main subjects and predicates.) For longer works, he goes out of his way to devise narrative structures that deemphasize plot and intensify lyric mood: In Memoriam and Maud are collections of lyrics in which narrative con- tinuity is only implied; the fragmentation of the Arthurian legend into discrete vignettes, idylls of the king, may be Tennyson's most strik- ing departure from his sources; even The Prin- cess presents itself as an improvised medley, a multimedia event for mixed voices. The case against Tennyson's narrative ability can rest more firmly on his disinclination than on his incompetence: he could convey action with thrift and force when he wanted to, but he did not often want to. We might say, recalling his determinist notions about character, that Tennyson's imagination was reluctant to believe in the efficacy of human action. Thus, when his characters conceive and attempt to execute plots, their plots are always frustrated: the frus- tration may be comic, as when the broken pur- poses of Princess Ida and her suitor lead to a higher harmony, or it may be tragic, as when the governing vision of Camelot decays. But in ei- ther case some external power, in the guise of providence or inertia, balks independent ini- tiative.9 Such instances of independence are rare: far more often in Tennyson action begins as reaction, where the proximate stimulus mat- ters less than some distant final cause, the call of the occult, the holy, the other. The Kraken (1830) stirs only when stirred by the distant fire of apocalypse; from the first the Lady of Shalott (1832) suffers under a curse that any course of action seems doomed to fulfill; the poet himself anticipates "Crossing the Bar" only in response to "one clear call" from beyond. This last poem suggests the relevance to Ten- nyson's other proclivities of his lifelong fondness for the quest. As a plot motif the quest permits plenty of action, but action in which the actors are subordinated to some authority outside themselves. Consider the mingled vigor and acquiescence of Tennyson's questers: on their travels the Magus in The Devil and the Lady (written before 1825), Galahad, Percivale, and company in "The Holy Grail" (1869), and the thinly veiled figure of the poet in "Merlin and the Gleam" (1889) meet with the most mar- velous things, but by the standards of romance they do remarkably little. They experience won- ders without confronting them; Tennysonian ex- perience, it appears, is not a mode of self- expression but a pressure exerted on the self from without. Even Odysseus, that archetypal Western adventurer, becomes in Tennyson's Ulysses a figure for whom "all experience" is somewhere out there, "an arch wherethrough / Gleams that untravelled world whose margin fades / Forever and forever when I move" (19-21).10 Tennyson's questers "move," like Ulysses, through space and time in order that they may be moved inwardly. "When he wishes to represent movement," Henry James observed of Tennyson, "the phrase always seems to me to pause and slowly pivot upon itself, or at most to move backward" (quoted in Ricks, Tennyson 133). His figures do not actively adopt perspec- tives, they find themselves in contexts; and the backward movement of his phrases and plots, insisting on the belatedness of context, acknowl- edges the inevitable power he enshrined in the past. Tennyson put so little stock in action, and in the capacity of human character to conceive a plot and bring it to fulfillment, because his inter- est lay instead in passion, a term whose etymo- logical connection to passivity his poetry consis- tently reinforces." It is this connection, I think, that explains his uncanny knack for making a landscape describe both an environmental and a mental state. This gift has been hailed retrospec- tively as a presymbolist technique; although Tennyson's important influence in this regard deserves further charting, I want to suggest that his sense of landscape is both more literal and less merely technical than such a categorization implies. If for Tennyson experience is the pres- sure of event, and usually of scene, upon the self, his renditions of inner and outer weather will coincide. In fact they never do quite coin- cide in Tennyson, as I shall suggest more fully in a moment, and it was left for later generations to alloy perception and passion in the extreme sim- plification of the pure poetic image.12 But Ten- nyson helped cast the crucible of imagism: the atrophy of character and action is sufficiently advanced in his poetry to let us say that his prime achievement consists in rendering the still, 11</page><page sequence="5">Tennyson and the Measure of Doom scenic imagery of an unalterable mood-and in composing the superb verbal music that, for him more than for any of his contemporaries, is no mere medium of rendition. Tennyson's acoustic tact, like that of Keats, reminds us both that emotion is feeling and that poetry is body lan- guage, although his great departure from Keats lies precisely in his paradoxical use of body lan- guage as a means for transcending bodily life and anything like ordinary emotion. III Tennyson's presentations of character and ac- tion, however principled they may be, remain relatively slender accomplishments. But to the reader who is willing to tolerate a certain ethical and practical poverty, Tennyson offers the twin compensations of his richest gifts: the sustained evocation of emotional atmosphere and the at- mospheric and physical acoustics of one of the most fulfilling voices in English tradition. These gifts are profoundly allied, and we might ap- proach the basis of their alliance by positing a typical Tennysonian setting and pursuing a few of its implications. His scenes are more literally "set" than those of most writers: vivid, immedi- ate details stand out like jewels against a shad- owy background. The vacancy of the middle dis- tance probably owes something to the poet's myopia; but his visual complaints and lifelong fear of blindness confirm the suggestions of sev- eral readers that for Tennyson detail served the ends of defense: his lovingly precise visualization of what was at hand arose in response to an awareness of a threat from beyond, a sentence of doom that was nearing its period (see Ford 38, Pitt 26).13 The face of his poetry is set to west- ward, to "a land / In which it seemed always afternoon" ("The Lotos-Eaters" 3-4)-and the longer after noon, the more evocative the tension between foreground and encroaching depth. Indeed, the time of day most in keeping with Tennyson's poetry of aftermath is dusk-a scene bathed in the half-light after sunset, not before dawn-a time of day that purchases its comprehensive overview at the sacrifice of any will to alter what past events have rendered in- evitable. When dawn does rise, more often than not it rises on an emphatically terminal situa- tion: the deathbed figure in "Tears, Idle Tears" from The Princess, the hopeless speaker of the seventh lyric from In Memoriam, and especially Tithonus greet the dawn with the poignant sense of discrepancy that engenders in Tennyson not irony but its cousin melancholy. Tennysonian dusk is a liminal hour, and its threshold has a clear sensory and psychic direction, away from sight into sound and feeling, away from charac- ter into passion, away from conscious will into mystic passivity. The field of vision at this hour features what is precious in evanescence: a fugi- tive gleam, a glimmering ghost, a shape or re- flection that pales into oceanic gloom-each, perhaps, like the glint of the discarded sword Ex- calibur, the wraith of an abandoned intention.14 The most memorable and characteristic mo- ments in Tennyson's poetry occur as sight is swallowed up in darkness and the visual is over- whelmed by an ascending power of sound that moans round with many voices, voices that themselves merge-as in the long view Tenny- son's precariously achieved personae merge- into the roar or pulse of an inevitable, unutter- able power. The haunt of this power Tennyson calls "the deep," a locality he approaches when the light of sense goes out and yields to auditory and kinesthetic evidences of a music that is both heard and felt, though hardly understood. When he wants an objective correlative to the power of the great deep, he habitually imagines the sea, which is less often briny or wine dark than oral in its attributes: vocal, devouring, or both. Thus, to take a famous instance, in the magnificent verse paragraph that closes "Ulysses" the "dark broad seas" first "gloom" afar, in the privation of sight (45), then acquire the blind, increas- ingly intimate power of voice and-finally, primally-of thirst, as they surround and ingest Tennyson's hungry-hearted speaker: "the deep / Moans round with many voices"; "It may be that the gulfs will wash us down" (55-56, 62). Yet even so persuasively embodied a sea is ulti- mately a figure for an inner tide of feeling that sweeps back beyond individual emotions to an epiphany of the inevitable, "that which is" (In Memoriam 95.39), with a rhythm, at once cardiac and astral, to which the whole creation moves.l' Tennyson was never comfortable about fixing 12</page><page sequence="6">Herbert F. Tucker, Jr. this inevitable power to form or linking its mani- festations to any inherited or devised intellectual system. Had he been able to do so more consis- tently he might have written the kind of poetry his Victorian public hoped they were reading when they pored over In Memoriam. But his intuitions of the music of the deep remained too sensuously concrete for that-Hallam was right to class his friend among the poets of sensation -and Tennyson remains an essentially modern, which is to say an essentially romantic, religious poet.'1 A primary task of literary criticism, for better or worse, is to conceptualize the sensuous workings of imagination; Tennyson makes this task unusually difficult by keeping his intuitions of inevitable power as conceptually and even mythically vague as they are physically urgent. We may do his imagination the least violence by respecting the temporality implied by his habitu- ally musical representation of power. "The Mys- tic" of 1830 "hath heard / Time flowing in the middle of the night, / And all things creeping to a day of doom" (38-40). The resolutely un- mystical speaker of "Locksley Hall" (1842) has likewise felt "the deep heart of existence beat forever like a boy's" (140)-though by now a more canny Tennyson uses a speaker's repudia- tion of this rhythmic sympathy to define one stage of an admittedly helter-skelter develop- ment. The same speaker can be recognized a decade later in Maud, and at one of the imagina- tive peaks of the poem he returns to the mystic measure of simultaneous intimacy and enormous distance: "Beat, happy stars, timing with things below" (1.679). The posthumously published "Akbar's Dream" (1892), where "the living pulse of Alla beats / Through all His world" and where the sun is conclusively hymned as a cos- mic metronome, "the flame that measures Time" (39-40, 201), follows the oriental detour of Tennyson's final phase back to the same pulse that had fed the ear of the young mystic of "Timbuctoo" (1829), in rapt attention to "the lordly music flowing from / The illimitable years" (214-15). In these musical intuitions, as in the "deep pulsations" of the "Aeonian music" from In Memoriam that measures out "The steps of Time-the shocks of Chance- / The blows of Death" (95.41-43), Tennyson hears not a per- son or a principle but what he calls "Eternal pro- cess" (82.5), not timeless sublimity but the sub- lime measure in and of time itself.17 His vision of transcendence is an audition of transience, and an audition made to measure: even when Ten- nyson registers the eternal process as linear or flowing, he takes care to break the flow into rhythmic units-from pulses to aeons-that creep or beat with a fundamentally musical or- ganization. At the same time, he is equally care- ful to keep the eternal process from sounding much more concrete than this elemental rhythm suggests. An exception proving this rule of tact occurs in "Tithonus," possibly Tennyson's great- est poem but in many respects a special case; Tithonus displays an extraordinary lust for the concrete by giving the weird music he hears an anthropomorphic source and shaping it as song: "That wild song I heard Apollo sing / While Ilion like a mist rose into towers" (62-63). The otherwise comparable music to which Merlin ascribes the building of Camelot is, more typi- cally, free of origin and contour: "the city is built / To music, therefore never built at all, / And therefore built for ever" ("Gareth and Lynette" 272-74). What perennially recurs at points of imaginative climax for Tennyson is itself a sense of eternal recurrence, a perception of rhythm that, by all contemporary accounts, dominated the poet's obsessive recitals of his own works for captive visitors and friends and that should inform our discussion of the effects of formal repetition in his verse. His metrical mastery, his circling syntax, and his manipula- tion of stanzaic forms do different jobs, of course, in different poems. But one way of seeing Tenny- son whole is to grasp these repetitive devices as modes of approach to, or recession from, musical intuitions of an inevitable "burden"- something he felt as a pressure and expressed in the half-mimetic, half-protective mediations of song (see Dodsworth, Kissane 32-33).18 In order to understand how Tennyson took up the burden of eternal process as both a weight and a shield, we should consider how its rhyth- mic movement bears an ambiguous relation to human mortality and thus to human time gener- ally. On the one hand-the hand of Keats is discernible here-the process means death to the individual self, and in two ways. Its measure 13</page><page sequence="7">14 Tennyson and thi enforces the march of a life from youth through age to the grave; and those who, en route, would listen to the music they are obeying can do so only by dying to the life of normal consciousness and into "weird seizures" like those that punctu- ate The Princess or into the kind of trance known by Arthur in "The Holy Grail," by the Ancient Sage (1885), and throughout his life by Tennyson himself (possibly in the less visionary, more pathological form of mild epilepsy).19 On the other hand-arguably the hand of Shelley- this figurative death or self-annihilation discloses intimations of immortality: Tennyson never represents the process as other than eternal, and in yielding to its vibration he enjoys a state that can know no death. Recognitions of the power, the process, the deep music of doom came to Tennyson early and .seem never to have deserted him for long. Since these recognitions demanded nothing less than the extinction of what he regarded as human personality, they came to prompt in him an am- bivalence almost as deep as the power itself. This ambivalence manifests itself variously in his reliance on binary devices for the structuring of individual poems and in his corresponding habit of balancing complementary poems within the volumes he published. It is more generally manifest in the melancholy that typifies the Ten- nysonian spirit. The elegiac tone and gesture of farewell that are hallmarks of his poetry have been derided in our century as the signs of an indulgent sentimentality, but we can better understand his melancholy if we recognize that it proceeds from his honesty. What Tennyson re- grets is the self's passing away, an imaginative necessity imposed by a power whose authority he would not shirk yet could not accept without a murmur.20 That murmur, the self's lament for the self, in counterpoint to the rhythmic groundswell of doom, generates Tennyson's po- etic theme: his subject and his music. Passion- ately melancholic and authoritatively passive, his speakers remain the victims of circumstance, and in a double sense: they regard themselves as heirs of a past they cannot control, and at the same time they invest the present scene of after- math with an enveloping power that dissolves the will. Coming to terms with the inevitable, they lament what they know too well to resist it. e Measure of Doom IV The close link between the atmospheric in- evitability of Tennyson's poetic world and the formal inevitability of his poetic style is appar- ent in his talent for ending even otherwise undis- tinguished poems with an authority that makes it extraordinarily hard to imagine how they might have ended in any other way. Influential poets and readers of English poetry during the first half of our century denigrated Tennyson in the mistaken, if valiant, belief that they might avoid his influence. But even these detractors con- ceded his remarkable verbal gift. Tennyson is the most finished, the most inevitable of poets, at least of poets in romantic tradition, and the inevitability that marks his style also character- izes the attitude that lies behind the style. One reason Tennyson's poems dependably create in us the impression that they had to conclude as they did is that Tennyson seems often to have been subject to that impression about events in the world as well as in poems. Finding imagined or actual events inevitable is a far cry from being in command of them, but it can offer a semblance of command, one that Tennyson sees reflected in the command of po- etic form. The comprehensive elaboration of his art seems to have given him a hold on himself and on his world; it also gave him a large mea- sure of his hold on contemporary readers. Apropos of Tennyson's versification, W. H. Auden offered this speculation on "the relation between the strictness and musicality of a poet's form and his own anxiety": "the more conscious he is of an inner disorder and dread, the more value he will place on tidiness in the work as a defence, as if he hoped that through his control of the means of expressing his emotions, the emotions themselves, which he cannot master directly, might be brought to order" (xviii).21 Composition as a means to composure: Auden half sneers at the idea ("tidiness in the work"), but twentieth-century readers taught by T. S. Eliot that poetry in general may be an escape from emotion and that Tennyson's poetry in par- ticular is great for the emotions of doubt and dread it never did quite escape (Eliot 10, 294) should be prepared to find in Tennyson's post- factual strategies and in the impeccability of his style the marks of a disturbingly modern sensi-</page><page sequence="8">Herbert F. Tucker, Jr. bility. As Tennyson once declared to his son, with a characteristic blending of sage generality and modest confession: "The artist is known by his self-limitation" (Memoir 1:118). Tennyson resorted to self-limitation as a means of self-defi- nition, a way of making himself known not only to himself but to others, in part because he wrote in and of a century that witnessed the disintegra- tion of traditional limits and goals. Well aware that the great world around him was spinning down the ringing grooves of change but fearfully ignorant of its destination, Tennyson defended against his ignorance by imagining terminal situ- ations in accomplished verse. Yet in leaping to the ends of things his imagination was too hon- est not to import into its defensive stronghold much of the melancholy helplessness that char- acterized the present it could only partially es- cape. A poet's grammar is an aspect of imaginative form, and we could describe in grammatical terms the Tennysonian discrepancy between that which is and that which might have been as a tension between indicative and subjunctive moods. An attempt to write the generative gram- mar of Tennyson's imagination could indeed begin with his success in animating the latent ambiguity of those past-tense forms that do double duty in English as subjunctives. Con- sider, for example, the lyric seed out of which he bred Maud: O that 'twere possible After long grief and pain To find the arms of my true love Round me once again! (2.141-44) 'O that 'twere possible": the verb denotes a situation contrary to fact. But through an emo- tionally trustworthy if philologically shaky homonymy that is part of the traditional wisdom of our language, the verb also invites us to con- ceive this hypothetical situation as part of a story set in the past and to live through the story, in imagination, to the end. As we know, that is what Tennyson did when he backed into the plot of Maud: in providing the antecedent action necessary "to render the poem fully intel- ligible," he added to the yearning "that 'twere possible" his speaker's awareness that, once upon a time, the consummation of true love was possible. The postfactual and the contrafactual implications of Tennyson's verb mix the inevita- bilities of memory and desire. Remorse enriches yearning to produce the emotional complex, deep as first love and wild with all regret, that is the condition for Tennyson's idle tears; and the Maud lyric ends with the speaker's longing "to weep, and weep, and weep / My whole soul out to thee" (2.237-38).22 A fuller consideration of Tennyson's histori- cal position would return us, I think, to the cen- tral dilemma outlined above: his poetry is caught between the desires of the self and the demands of a power whose recognition exacts, in one way or another, the dissolution of the self. To the latter imperative he owes his utter authority of manner, to the former the sub- merged lyric drive whose strength we must largely infer from his pervasive melancholy, which is a symptomatic response to the incom- patibility of the two imperatives he faced. It is impossible to say whether Tennyson's authority or his melancholy had the greater appeal for contemporary readers, especially since after his earliest poetry the two are rarely found apart. But an important clue to his popularity is prob- ably that, writing during a crisis of authority, he was able simultaneously to gratify conflicting needs. The seal of certitude allayed publicly a cultural malaise that the note of melancholy was secretly feeding all the while. Tennyson was no hypocrite; a sense of scruple, if anything, produced his peculiarly undog- matic certitude and his vagueness about the ob- ject of his grief. Yet these very characteristics arguably made his dilemmas and resolutions more available for public adoption. It did not strike Aubrey de Vere as strange that a lament of erotic frustration like "O that 'twere possible" should occupy a place first in a volume got up "for the aid of a sick clergyman" and later in a long poem containing some of the bitterest social invective Tennyson ever published. Presumably something in the poem's theme of loss, and in the peculiar kind of "aid" it offered through the expression of loss, struck a common chord that resounded through the multiple discontents of the age. Nowadays our analysis of Victorian malaise would include among its interlocking causes industrialization and the consequent alienation of workers from traditional modes of 15</page><page sequence="9">Tennyson and the Measure of Doom labor, rapid restratification of English social classes, correlative shifts in the political power base, the crumbling of religious orthodoxy, and much more. Tennyson's special fitness for the role of Victoria's laureate was that he could consistently and inventively let a reading public touched by any or all of these causes imagine that the situation was awful and that it was also, somehow, at last, all right. He spoke for a mod- ern malaise, and he spoke to it. His readers re- sponded-as they can still respond-to the ex- pression of an inconsolable loss beyond words, a content irreducible to form, and at the same time to a polished style offering a genuine con- solation of its own, a reassuring message inde- pendent of thematic content. Auden's comment about the relation of for- mal to emotional control draws on the plausible assumption that what sounds right to a poet suc- ceeds because it also feels right. Like the more rhetorical pronouncements we meet in Arnold's literary criticism, Tennyson's obiter dicta on the stylistic properties of other poets often disclose his sympathy or antipathy to what those poets say as much as to the way in which they say it. He seems to have been moved especially by turns of phrase that emphasize the sense of in- evitable aftermath we find in his own writing; and on more than one revealing occasion, he gives other writers' suggestive phrases yet more emphatic twists in the direction of a Tenny- sonian doom. William Allingham, a minor Vic- torian poet whose lionizing of Tennyson appears throughout the ingenuous diary he left behind, twice records the laureate's admiration for the following two lines from Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale": Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn. (27 July 1884; page 327) : The words are quoted accurately (by Tennyson, we may presume, as well as by Allingham), but Keats's syntax has been truncated to make the lines appear more Tennysonian than Keatsian. Keats wrote that in hearing the voice of the nightingale he heard the same song that had filled the ears of emperor, clown, and the bibli- cal Ruth: "The same that oft-times hath/ Charm'd magic casements. .. ." Tennyson lops off the subject and the auxiliary verb of Keats's clause and effectively transforms "Charm'd" into a past passive participle that links up with "forlorn" to frame the active participle "open- ing." As Tennyson remembers them, Keats's lines suggest a magic that performs itself without the benefit of magician, the work of an agency even more mysterious than the one the "Ode" had addressed. Tennyson's memory, like much of his best poetry, avoids confrontation with the cause and relishes its effects instead. Of course, the surest evidence of poets' verbal susceptibilities occurs in their own works, and we might look further at the way two of Tenny- son's best-known poems grew from the germ of a phrase transplanted from its context into his imagination. Hallam Tennyson writes, "My fa- ther's poems were generally based on some sin- gle phrase like 'Someone had blundered': and were rolled about, so to speak, in his head, be- fore he wrote them down." Hallam's specific example comes from "The Charge of the Light Brigade," which the poet wrote after reading the phrase "some hideous blunder" in the Times for 13 November 1854; "and this," writes his son, "was the origin of the metre of his poem" (1:268, 381; Martin misquotes the last phrase as "a hideous blunder" [381]). Bearing in mind the effect on Tennyson of Keats's "Charm'd magic casements," we should suspect that the germinal phrase from the Times supplied him with more than meter. Our suspicion is con- firmed when we see how this unusually action- packed poem never does get back to the precipi- tating blunder, which remains the deed of an unspecified agent ensconced in the pluperfect: "Someone had blundered" (12). The Light Brigade are a heroic company for Tennyson in that they are doomed-accursed rather than charmed, but at all events "framed," performing the will of a power they cannot question. In de- scribing the Light Brigade as "hurried to their doom by some inextricable error" and the Brit- ish soldier as "not paralyzed by feeling that he is the victim of some hideous blunder," the Times had evidently given Tennyson an idea as well as a sound. That he remembered his debt as a metri- cal one betokens the indivisibility of idea from sound in the poet's mind; the compression of passivity into valor, together with the alliterative hum of doom ("victim of some hideous blun- 16</page><page sequence="10">Herbert F. Tucker, Jr. der"), presented him with what he so often needed in order to compose: an emotionally congenial subject and a tonic refrain to which he might build his battering stanzas. Occasionally, then, Tennyson might recall phrasing like Keats's verbatim but in such a way as to revise its sense; at other times he might find a rough-hewn phrase like "some hideous blun- der" and roll it about in his head until he had smoothed its wording into consonance with his own internal measure. An early lyric that fur- nishes an extreme instance of this latter process is "Mariana." The poem begins with an epigraph attributed-appropriately enough for my argu- ment-to Shakespeare's Measure for Measure: "Mariana in the moated grange." Strictly speak- ing, Tennyson's attribution is incorrect, since the closest wording in Shakespeare is the speech of Duke Vincentio: "I will presently to St. Luke's; there at the moated grange resides this dejected Mariana" (3.1.256-58). That "moated grange" is what drew Tennyson to Mariana: like the phrases we have already discussed, it is a past passive construction, and Tennyson based on it one of his most perfect distillations of formida- bly defended victimage and fixation on the past. In turn the power of this evocation seems to have colored Tennyson's verbal memory. He plucked Mariana and her grange from the Duke's declarative sentence, isolated her in a fragment, condensed Shakespeare's phrasing, and substi- tuted "in" for "at." This revision immures Mariana yet further in a murmur of m's and n's that seems to proceed from her own name and implies the self-enclosure, the tyranny of Mariana over herself, that is the un-Shakespearean sub- ject of Tennyson's altogether original poem. V In his civilized, often urbane authority, his unremitting estimate of the sacrifices that self- conscious life in civilization exacts, and his pains- taking elaboration of a verse that gives expres- sion to both, Tennyson is the most Vergilian of English poets. A principal difference between Augustus' imperial laureate and Victoria's is that, where Vergil faced Homer as his major precursor, Tennyson faced the English roman- tics. Hence Tennyson's best work gives priority to the problems of the imperial self, rather than to those of political and cultural empire, and replaces Vergil's rationalized Olympian pan- theon with a mythology of the divided psyche, under the regime of an irresistible power he spoke by but could not name. As a Victorian romantic, Tennyson tends toward lyric and idyl- lic forms instead of toward the didactic and epic forms refined by Vergil; but across nearly two millennia the congruence of these poets' sensibili- ties is striking, particularly in their attitudes toward form itself. Tennyson's late tribute "To Virgil" (1882) records the salute of one kindred spirit to an- other, in shared sympathy with the vision of the tears in things, Vergil's lacrimae rerum: "Thou that seest Universal Nature moved by Universal Mind; / Thou majestic in thy sadness at the doubtful doom of human kind" (11-12). Yet Tennyson reserves his highest praise for Vergil the "lord of language," who captured "All the charm of all the Muses often flowering in a lonely word" (3, 6). Not a single word, a lonely word: it is as if the lacrimae rerum were also lacrimae verborum, as if the magical "charm" and the pathetic "charm" of poetic language were one and the same. For Tennyson, Vergil expresses not the pathos of a sublime isolation but the sublimity of a pathos that words can approximate and poetic rhythm can convey. Across vast space and time, the sympathetic vi- bration of an "ocean-roll of rhythm" joins the poet of a perished empire with the spokesman of "the Northern Island sundered once from all the human race" (16, 18)-sundered once but since redeemed into community with the Euro- pean culture sown by Vergil that had led in En- gland to the development of the accentual- syllabic prosody Tennyson was among the last great poets to cultivate. There is an abyss in things, replenished first by tears and then by the patient art of the poet as human communicant. Vergil's majesty, like Tennyson's, inheres in the measure of his "sadness," and not vice versa: tears well up from the depth of a despair that is divine, and the poet's definitively human touch makes language of a cry, shapes an idyll from idle tears. Thus it is as a touchstone of the human, as the formalist artist who respects the ends of things and "is known by his self-limita- tion," that Tennyson salutes Vergil in the last 17</page><page sequence="11">Tennyson and the Measure of Doom words of the poem: "Wielder of the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of man" (20).24 His focus on Vergil's "measure," as on the "metre" he heard in a newspaper article, shows us once more how poetic rhythm served Tenny- son as a way of capturing and transmitting the deep music of the doubtful doom of humankind -again, "Aeonian music measuring out / The steps of Time-the shocks of Chance- / The blows of Death." The point of this capture, the "use in measured language" (In Memoriam 5.6), was for Tennyson mimetic and expressive at once. He intended his rhythms to imitate the pulse of inevitability that he felt within the core of human experience and that he intuited beyond its further reaches and to express the deep if somewhat narrow range of moods that arise in acknowledging, and submitting to, the inevita- ble. Tennyson hoped to achieve by incantation -"The charm of all the Muses"-what could not be achieved, he was sure, by the reasoning mind. His aim was not to master the inevitable but to take its measure in the music of doom, to render it not intelligible but perceptible and communicable as the ground of a fate we should otherwise share without quite knowing it. Northwestern University Evanston, Illinois Notes 1 Quoted in Ricks, Poems 1037. I cite this edition of the poetry throughout. The authoritative account of the 1837 publication of "O that 'twere possible" in Martin 226-28 suggests that de Vere's report may be inaccurate in some minor details. 2 See also Ricks's comments in Tennyson on the poet's "extraordinary powers over situation and mood, played against a known outcome," and on his related fondness for quoting or alluding to his own earlier poems in later ones (275, 298-312). The teleological cast of Tennyson's compositional practice seems espe- cially appropriate to a poet who composed in his head and who, on losing his manuscripts, could retrieve from memory whole volumes for publication. Compare Browning, whose more aggressively open-ended works were composed at a desk with paper and ink. For further remarks on Tennyson's habits of composition, see Gillett. : The works of Paden and Carr are essential for understanding Tennyson's "passion of the past" and "mask of age." 4 See Gransden on "the shadow of an older wisdom than evolution: the Fall" (11). Extended discussions of Tennyson's sense of history appear in A. Dwight Cul- ler 14-15 and Kozicki. Culler adopts metaphors from Victorian geology in charting the poet's movement from "catastrophism" to "uniformitarianism" and back again. I would add that for the uniformitarian Tennyson his- tory was a process working itself out through passive human agents and that as a catastrophist he tended to locate the apocalyptic moment so far in the future or past that the present became a theater of anticipation or aftermath, producing not a bang but a whimper. Kozicki, subdividing the career into six phases based on the ideas of "ordinary providence" and "active provi- dence" that Tennyson picked up at Cambridge in the late 1820s, makes his case for the centrality of the heroic will at the cost of neglecting what I wish to emphasize, the poet's doomsaying tone. : See Ricks, Tennyson: "Tennyson's essential genius is exploratory of the human situations for which there seems to be no denouement" (293). For Philip Drew, "Tennyson and the Dramatic Monologue: A Study of Maud," Tennyson's characters "are usually, like their creator, unhappy victims of the way things are and can only express their fury and their helplessness in a kind of baffled bewilderment" (Palmer 142). 6Tennyson's baffling of guilt has elicited an un- usually wide spectrum of response. Francis Golffing finds that Tennyson "lacked any real sense of tragic guilt" (266); Ricks describes the paradox of a "strange sense of guilt" that "also felt aggrievedly innocent" (Tennyson 77). For an excellent and suggestive analy- sis of the guilt in "Ulysses," see Storch 293. 7 Ricks, Tennyson 246-47, and Martin 385-86 sum- marize the autobiographical features, most of which Rader treats at length. 8 On the narrative frustration that makes of Tenny- son's poetry an allegorical haunt, see Ford 40, Carr 51, Pitt 215, Mays 45, and Lourie 22. Rhetorical analyses of relevant effects in imagery may be found in Shaw 285-89; Sinfield, "Tennyson's Imagery"; and Sherry 211-16. 9 See Korg: "the reversals of fulfillment in his works occur, not as the results of moral law or character, nor even as co-incidences, but through the operation of anomalous supernatural agencies" (11). What Korg calls the "pattern of fatality" need not disable all narra- tive, of course. At least since the Iliad the fulfillment of a preordained destiny has been available to Western authors as a classic model-maybe the classical model -for a satisfactory plot. That such a pattern in Tenny- son usually evokes not satisfaction but defeat is a mea- sure of his reluctant but undeniable romanticism. Even 18</page><page sequence="12">Herbert F. Tucker, Jr. when the plot of fate remains benign and overtakes his characters in wish-fulfilling ways, his verse expresses a counter wish that character had retained a more prop- erly romantic ascendancy over circumstance. 10 Cf. House on Tennyson's sense of vocation as "something external calling him on to do he knew not what, not as an internal principle working itself out" (125). 11 Altieri finds "how nearly indistinguishable activity and passivity can grow" in Tennyson (294). 12 In 1831, long before anyone had heard of the symbolist movement, Arthur Hallam praised Tennyson for his "vivid, picturesque delineation of objects, and the peculiar skill with which he holds all of them fused, to borrow a metaphor from science, in a medium of strong emotion"; and in 1835 John Stuart Mill identi- fied Tennyson's "power of creating scenery in keeping with some state of human feeling; so fitted to it as to be the embodied symbol of it" (quoted in Martin 111, 226). For assessments of Tennyson's place with regard to his symbolist successors, see H. M. McLuhan, Baker 48-53, and Sinfield, Language 201-10. See also Shaw: "Tennyson was always more than a poet of sensation, and never trusted objects enough to be a real Sym- bolist" (62). 1:3 On the absence of middle distance in Tennyson see Nicolson 278-79, Pitt 22, and Gransden 28. 14 For Brashear, "the great hour in Tennyson is that tragic hour when the self fades away into darkness, ful- filling all of the poet's despairing pessimism" (18). See also Shaw 49 for relevant comments on section 95 of In Memoriam. In the indictment with which Faulkner closes chapter 13 of Light in August, Reverend High- tower turns from the window shortly after "the first dark" to escape into his dog-eared copy of Tennyson. Faulkner's hypnotic syntax, atmospheric richness, and ambivalent response to cultural decadence place Faulk- ner among Tennyson's uneasy American heirs; hence, perhaps, the arresting bitterness of his attack, and the accuracy with which he sets it at a quintessentially Tennysonian hour. 15 For another account of the relations of the visual and the auditory in Tennyson, see Hollander: "a sound- rich description of a visual phenomenon which itself stands for an auditory one" (686). 1( Hallam Tennyson records his father's question, "What will people come to in a hundred years? Do you think they will give up all religious forms and go and sit in silence in the Churches listening to the organs?" (2:401). 17 Welch argues that "for Tennyson that centrality of being, that which is, is time itself" (202). 18 Emotional and stylistic effects of the "burden" or "refrain" are suggested in Spitzer 197 and in Ricks, Tennyson 44-49. 19 Martin discusses the likelihood of epilepsy in Tennyson and his family (28-29, 84-85, 279-80). See also the introductory discussion of the trances in Cul- ler 1-13. 20 See Pitt: "the desire to escape, and the desire to hold on to the self, to achieve the clear definiteness of conscious existence, are in constant tension with one another" (33). 21 Ricks remarks on the relation between confidence and linguistic play in The Princess (Tennyson 197-98). Against Tennyson's doctrinal pronouncement to Edmund Gosse that while people "fancy it is the thought that makes poetry live; it isn't, it's the expression, the form," it is helpful to set this bit of self-deprecation: "I don't think that since Shakespeare there has been such a mas- ter of the English language as I. To be sure, I've got nothing to say" (Martin 562, 317-18). 22Sinfield, in "'That Which Is,'" and Puckett de- bate the structural consequences of grammatical mood in a single work. I would suggest that Carr's concise paraphrase of Paden's thesis about the "mask of age" -"the face of desire and anxiety appears as memory and regret" (48)-offers a way of reconciling these moods. For a few among many possible examples, cf. "Life piled on life / Were all too little" ("Ulysses" 24- 25), "Oh God, that I were dead!" ("Mariana" 84), and "I, the divided half of such / A friendship as had mas- tered Time" (In Memoriam 85.63-64). :3 The entry for 2 Sept. 1880 records that on an- other occasion Tennyson quoted the bulk of the stanza, then returned to repeat the last two lines (296). 24 My linking Tennyson with Vergil is anything but original. Even without the late evidence of "To Virgil," the strong affinity between these two poets is likely to impress anyone who reads their major works with care; and in any case the resemblance is a critical common- place by now. But like most of our commonplaces about Tennyson, this one stands in need of some ana- lytic sophistication. When not just impressionistic, criti- cal comparisons between Vergil and Tennyson tend to address either the poets' parallel historical situations as melancholy apologists for empire or else their formal similarities as polishers of memorable verses. Surely, however, these dimensions of imperial content and formal mastery should be placed in relation to each other. When John Killham writes, in "Tennyson and Victorian Social Values," of a Vergilian "sublimation of the yearning of spirit and flesh, and a recognition that man is born to bring civilization out of his own discontents" (Palmer 178), his apt birthing image im- plies that the means of sublimation are in part those of creative artistry. Likewise, when Carr writes, "If there is a definitively Tennysonian theme, this is it-a re- iterated and dreamlike sense of loss that becomes idyllic self-assurance" (54), we ought to ask how much of the "idyllic self-assurance" results from the formal "reit- eration" or verbal patterning that typifies the densely styled art of a Tennyson or a Vergil. Shaw makes a start by analyzing syntactic correspondences between the two poets (33-38). A more satisfactory compara- tive account of Vergil and Tennyson, one that investi- gated content and form alike with a view to ascertaining how these dimensions of poetic art are mutually re- lated, might then relate its findings further to each poet's place in literary history as a self-consciously belated author working in secondary, superbly literary modes. 19</page><page sequence="13">Tennyson and the Measure of Doom Allingham, William.
