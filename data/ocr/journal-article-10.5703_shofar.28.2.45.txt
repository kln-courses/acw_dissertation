<plain_text> <page sequence="1">  Spin Explained ♦ 45 Spin Explained: On Fallen Angels,  Free Will, and Fixing the World  Mois Navon  Divrei Navon Spin is a short film (7 minutes) that portrays a supernatural DJ who “falls” to  earth and attempts to bring harmony to a complex city scene. He does so by  modifying nature in modest but mystical ways through manipulations of his  turntables and mixer. The identity of the DJ is only hinted at through various  symbols which can be interpreted to indicate that he is none other than one of  the fallen angels mentioned in various mystical texts. However, though the film  revolves around the DJ and is seen through his eyes, the film is not about the  DJ but rather it is about the human condition. It is about the nature of creation  and man’s interactions therein. It is about the interplay between free will and  providence.  On Spin After winning 35 film festival awards within two years of its release, the short  film entitled Spin has achieved what might rightly be termed “classic” status.1  Such accolades draw our attention and raise the question: why? It is the con- tention of this paper that the film has garnered such commendation due to  the depth of its message expressed in both a pithy and hip way within a very  “pedestrian” context, and thus one which all can easily identify with.  We begin to decode the short from its most telling title, “Spin,” which can  be understood to have a number of connotations. The first and most obvi- ous is that of the “spin” that the DJ applies to his turntables.

Another prominent “spin” in the film is that of the basketball  which is the source of all unexpected activity in the clip. By his spin, both on  the turntable and on the basketball, the film’s DJ gives a new “spin” to a singular  scene, changing people’s perceptions of the very same issue.2  Regarding “spins” and personal perceptions of a particular object or issue,  nothing is more open to interpretation than a piece of art, be it in the form  of painting, prose, film, or other media. What rules the day is not the artist’s  original intention but the viewer’s perception.3 That being said, an interpreta- tion must substantiate its claims to obtain legitimacy. Thus it is the objective  of this essay to explain the film convincingly from the perspective of Jewish  philosophy. The intent here is not to explain the film per se, but rather to  utilize its astounding power to explain Jewish philosophy. In this sense the  film serves as an articulation of Jewish philosophy, which might otherwise be  difficult to assimilate. Fallen Angels The film opens in an alleyway made up of the backsides of buildings, trash  dumpsters lined up periodically against the walls. In the center of the alley is  a circle of light made by what appears to a strong beam coming from above. A  rushing sound is heard and the figure of a man clothed in black falls from above,  within the beam, directly unto the center of the circle of light on the alleyway  floor. He slowly looks back, up from whence he fell, only to quickly grab his  head in an attempt to take cover as two large equipment trunks coming crash- ing to the ground, with the same great rushing sound, almost hitting him. Slowly at first, but then purposefully, the man gets up, head raised, un- daunted by what must be presumed to have been an unwanted experience. His  face is now for the first time completely visible in the strong light of the beam;  a distinct full-lip-kiss lipstick imprint on his right cheek is momentarily, but  nevertheless blatantly, noticeable. This individual goes on to play out his role in trying to alter the interac- tions of various unrelated people in a busy town square toward a harmonious  accord. He does this in the capacity of a supernatural DJ who can modify na- ture in modest ways through manipulations of his turntables and mixer. 2Individuals who change people’s perceptions are sometimes referred to as “spin doctors.” 3Northrop Frye (Anatomy of Criticism [Princeton, 1990], p. 5) writes, “[T]he Dante  who writes a commentary on the first canto of Paradiso is merely one more of Dante’s crit- ics. What he says has a peculiar interest, but not a peculiar authority.” Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="3">  Spin Explained ♦ 47 Putting these pieces together, the character assembled can be described  as a “fallen angel.” The Zohar4 elaborates on the circumstances behind the  anomalous phenomenon of fallen angels: What is man that You are mindful of him, and the son of man that You visit him?  (Psalms 8:5). Rav Shimon said: This was uttered by those in charge of the world  at the time when God expressed His intention of creating man. He called to- gether various companies of heavenly angels and sat them before Him. He said  to them: ‘I desire to create man.’ They exclaimed, ‘Man abides not in honor . . .’  (Psalms 49:13).5 God thereupon put forth His finger and burned them. He then  set other groups before Him, and said: ‘I desire to create man.’ They said, ‘What is  man that You are mindful of him? What is the character of this man?’ He replied:  ‘Man will be in Our image, and his wisdom will be superior to yours.’ When  He had created man and he sinned and obtained a pardon, Uzza and Azael ap- proached Him and said: ‘We have a claim against You, for the man whom You  have made has sinned against You.’ He said to them: ‘Had you been with them  you would have been worse.’ And God cast them down from their holy position  in heaven. The Zohar brings to the fore a fundamental difficulty in the creation of  man: man’s imperfect, even ignoble, nature denoted by the verse, “Man abides  not in honor.” To this allegation God does not argue but simply removes the  claimants through force. God goes on to discuss the creation of man with  another set of angels to whom he tells only of man’s greatness. Thus man’s  problematic nature is something that was known to God but something that  He nevertheless decidedly ignored.6  Upon man’s downfall, two angels7 come in righteous indignation to re- buke God for having created man. God then rebuffs them with the claim that  even they would not be able to withstand the temptations of the earthly realm.  To prove His point he casts them down to earth. 4Balak 207b. Similarly Zohar (Ber. 25a-b; Ber. 37a). Bereishit Rabati (Bereishit p.  29), Yalkut Shimoni (Ber. 44), Otzar HaMidrashim (“Shemhazai &amp; Azael,” in Eisenstein  edition, pp. 549–550) have a slightly different version which portrays the angels asking  God to be put to the test of earthly temptation, whereupon He allows them their wish. As  an interesting aside, this version goes on to explain that after their sins, one of the angels,  Shemhazai, repented.  5See Radak (Ps 49:13). 6See also Ber. R. (8:5), which makes the same statement. 7While the Zohar names them as Uzza and Azael, Rashi (Bam. 13:33) identifies them  as Shemhazai and Azael, similarly Bereishit Rabati (Bereishit p. 29), Yalkut Shimoni (Ber.  44), Otzar HaMidrashim (“Shemhazai &amp; Azael ,” [Eisenstein], pp. 549–550). Targum Yo- natan (Gen. 6:4) has them as Shemhazai and Uzziel (which is spelled the same as Azael   Vol. 28, No. 2   ♦   2010 </page> <page sequence="4"> 48 ♦ Mois Navon     The Midrash8 goes on to explain in detail the result of the angels’ earthly  endeavor: The angels who fell from their place in heaven saw the daughters of the genera- tions of Cain walking about naked, with their eyes painted like harlots, and they  went astray after them, and took wives from amongst them, as it is written, “And  the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were beautiful; and they  took them wives of whomever they chose.” (Gen. 6:2)  While the Midrash and the Zohar (Ber. 37a) explain that these fallen  angels sinned upon entering the earthly realm, the apocryphal book of Jubilees  (ca. 2nd c. BCE) makes the observation that before the angels went astray, they  actually worked to help man to do right and good: “[T]he angels of the Lord  descended on the earth, those who are named the Watchers, that they should  instruct the children of men, and that they should do judgment and upright- ness on the earth” (4:15–16).9 The protagonist of our story fits this description like a glove. He is clearly  thrown down from above, as the Zohar explained. That he was sent down  unwillingly is made clear by his equipment cases that come crashing down,  almost on him, while he ducks for cover. Furthermore, his being dressed in  black can be taken as the symbol of an outcast. And indeed a DJ is in many  ways representative of anti-establishment outlooks—certainly our DJ exhibits  this character. In addition, being thrown into an alleyway with garbage bins  underlines his being kicked out and tossed away like unwanted refuse.  His coming through a beam of light emphasizes that the “above” from  whence he fell is heaven itself, light being the ultimate anthropomorphism of  God and the heavenly realms which are His “abode.”10 The DJ’s objective of  saving man leads us to believe that he is an “angel” in the colloquial sense of the  word—that is, an altruistic being that comes in one’s hour of need. His ability  to manipulate worldly circumstances in a supernatural way further enforces  the notion that he is not of this world.  with different vowelization). 8Pirke DeRebbi Eliezer, ch. 22. Similarly Zohar (Ber. 25a-b; Ber. 37a; Bam. 208a). 9That Jubilees is referring to the same angels that strayed is clear from the verses (4:22– 23) wherein Enoch testified against them for their sinning with the daughters of men. 10“In all Kabbalistic systems, light-symbolism is very commonly used with regard to  Ein Sof [God]” (G. Scholem, Kabbalah, p. 90). “[T]he Lord will be to thee an everlasting  light” (Isaiah 60:19). “[God who is] wrapped in light as a garment” (Psalms 104:2). “[I]n  Thy light do we see light” (Psalms 36:10). See also Genesis Rabba (3:3); Zohar (Intro.,  12a); Talmud (Brachot 17a, 64a). Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="5">  Spin Explained ♦ 49 Interestingly, this angelic DJ exercises control over his theatre similar to  an earthly DJ. It is he who makes the music that animates the people. It is his  rhythm and beat to which people move their bodies, though each individual  moves according to his own unique nature and desire. This too is the modus  operandi of our fallen angel. Finally, the lipstick on his cheek serves to symbolize his attraction to wom- en and could be taken as the mark of the evil inclination (i.e., yetzer hara). For  though the yetzer hara drives man to many activities, its primary drive is to that  of women, as the Zohar (Vayikra 15b) teaches: “When the yetzer hara overcomes  a person it is by nothing other than sexuality.” This is in consonance with the  Zohar’s (Ber. 37a [Tosefta]) description of the fallen angels which explains that,  “at the time of their fall they acquired the yetzer hara.”11 And indeed, it is by their  lusting after women that the angels are said to have been trapped. The clip depicts what might have happened to the angels upon their im- mediate descent to earth. Since they had claimed they would fare better than  man and maintain their angelic status even in the earthly realm, it is reason- able to assume that they initially set out to fulfill some altruistic endeavor (as  mentioned in Jubilees).12 The clip then shows the frustration one angel felt at  the evidently endless job of maintaining man in perfection, which caused him  to run away from such a task. Running away from altruism leaves open either  benign earthly endeavors or hedonistic ones—the Midrash teaches that it was  the latter that allured the angels.  As to the whereabouts of the second angel, perhaps there is an allusion to  him in the first rewind that the DJ performs. During this scene we note that  while everyone and everything in the entire scene is moving backwards, there  is one lone individual running forward down the stairs! This clearly indicates  that he is not part of the machinations and control of the DJ and quite plausi- bly is not part of the human world.13 11See also Pirke DeRebbi Eliezer (ch. 22) which explains that they acquired the form  of man.  12Indeed, as will be explained, the angels’ position stemmed from a lack of under- standing of the necessity of evil, and consequently they immediately set out to rectify the  “superfluous” evil, herein depicted as a car accident. 13I wish to acknowledge my son Elisha Binyamin Navon (5th grade Aseh Hayil, Efrat)  for this interpretation.  Vol. 28, No. 2   ♦   2010 </page> <page sequence="6"> 50 ♦ Mois Navon     Complexity of Man’s World Though the film revolves around the DJ and is seen through his eyes, the film  is not about the DJ but rather about man and his world. It is about the nature  of creation and man’s interactions within creation. An indication of this point  is alluded to by the only verbiage shown in the clip. The words are found on  a hand-written sign being used by a break-dancer to collect charity. The sign  has a number of expressions, the first and largest reading: “Philosophy Ma- jor”—hinting at the clip’s central theme of “Major Philosophy.”  Attempt I—Disaster  Upon meeting the DJ, we follow him to a busy town square where a serious  accident involving a car and bicyclist has just occurred. This is our first view of  man in his world. It is a place of imperfection, a place where the consequence  of such imperfection is severe injury or death.  The DJ rewinds and replays the scene three times in order to determine  the source of the accident (i.e., a fallen basketball) and ascertain a solution (i.e.,  spin the basketball on a different trajectory). The DJ’s emotional detachment  is portrayed in strong contrast to the shock and concern of various bystanders,  many of whom are shown offering help to the victim. The DJ, coming as he  was from his lofty position in heaven where he had just finished arguing with  God that man was a simple and unworthy creature, especially in comparison  with the angels, is rather smug. He is smug in his trivial resolution to the ac- cident and he is smug in the face of man’s simple incompetence. So confident in the simplicity of the task at hand is he, that upon affect- ing a mere twist of the basketball and seeing the bicyclist avoid collision, he  is openly satisfied, exhibiting overt conceit at the elegance of his solution. He  then packs up his equipment and begins to be on his way. But if the clouds  over his head are any indication of the very imperfection of his solution, his  attention is drawn back to the town square where he notices that the basket- ball is now on a collision course with another man. This then causes a human  domino effect that leaves a wheelchair-bound woman the victim of a new car  accident. The domino effect can be seen as an expression of the theory of determin- ism, which maintains that all events are inevitable consequences of anteced- ent sufficient causes. Though this theory in its pure form leaves no room for  free will, others argue that in fact free will itself demands a level of determin- ism in nature. For without deterministic cause-and-effect relationships in the  world one could not plan to effect one’s own will. Without an act “a” always,  deterministically, causing event “b,” one could never decide to effect “b.” On  the other hand if the world is purely deterministic, then after one initial act of  Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="7">  Spin Explained ♦ 51 creation, everything just follows naturally, like a neat row of dominos falling  after an initial push. The two, however, can be seen to be “compatible,” wherein  the world operates according to a “soft-determinism” which provides for de- terministic behavior that allows for free will. This is explored further in the  subsequent scenes of the clip. Attempt II—Catastrophe  The DJ is surprised, perhaps slightly embarrassed, as he looks around to see if  anyone noticed. Nevertheless, he is still emotionally detached as he unpacks his  equipment and quickly rewinds the scene. This time, however, his face exhibits  intent determination in the realization that the task at hand is not as simple as  he originally imagined. He now considers each person on the scene and then  with a momentary thoughtful look to the sky, he rewinds and confidently sends  the record forward—and with it the town square is set into motion. By considering each person he demonstrates that he has assimilated, at  least superficially, the lesson of the first attempt: the world is woven of a com- plex fabric of human interactions wherein people are more connected than  might at first appear. The mystical text Reisheet Hochmah (ch. 14) likens a  nation to a taut rope made of a great many individual strands—“when one end  of the rope is moved the whole rope is correspondingly moved.”14 Similarly the  Midrash (Vay. R. [Margoliot], 4:6) expresses the idea as follows: R. Shimon Bar Yohai taught [the idea of interrelatedness] by way of analogy:  There were a number of people in a boat and one of them started to drill a hole  under his seat. The others exclaimed, “why are you doing that?!” He replied, “Of  what interest is it to you, am I not only drilling under my own seat?!” They re- sponded, “Because, you are flooding us out of the boat!” And the Jerusalem Talmud (Ned. 9:4), in explaining the logic behind the  biblical prohibition against taking revenge, notes that people are as interre- lated as the various parts of one body: “[If ] a person is cutting meat then cuts  his hand, should the injured hand now take the knife and cut the hand which  originally held the knife?!”  Following the DJ’s consideration of various individuals, he again flaunts  smug confidence at his new-found solution, and upon twisting the basketball  into a new direction, immediately packs up his equipment. He stops to watch  his handiwork unfold only to be witness to complete mayhem.  As in the first attempt, the “domino effect” is again depicted. However,  whereas in the first attempt people fell like perfectly arranged dominos illus- 14See also Talmud Shvuot 39a.  Vol. 28, No. 2   ♦   2010 </page> <page sequence="8"> 52 ♦ Mois Navon     trating “hard determinism,” in this second attempt people are shown to react,  instead of being forced by purely external circumstances. Though it is difficult  to say that the people express pure free will, there is now an opening to con- sider man’s responsibility in the transpiring events, as opposed to man’s sheer  helplessness in the face of circumstance exhibited in the first attempt. In this second attempt, we are witness to numerous acts and events: some  deterministic, some seemingly mere coincidence, some determined by the  characters themselves, as well as their various, and sometimes far-reaching, in- fluences. The break-dancer trips on the basketball and kicks it unwittingly into  the back of a gangster, who then sees the ball in his rival’s hands and decides  to start a fight. A young woman sitting and reading gets up to help the fallen  break-dancer and inadvertently knocks a syringe out of a drug-dealer’s hands,  which then goes flying into the reach of a little girl. She picks up the syringe  and her mother screams in dismay. This scream jolts the hearing aid of an old  man who consequently has a heart attack. He falls into a passing business- man who grabs him from falling and in the process, accidentally smears some  ketchup from his food on the old man. The old man’s wife in a wheelchair sees  her husband, seemingly bloodied by the businessman, and sprays mace at her  husband’s apparent attacker. In the meantime, one of the gangsters, now walk- ing backwards, pulls out a gun, bumps into the businessman, and fires. The  negative interactions are thus brought to a crescendo and the scene literally  blows up.  Beyond the ideas of “determinism,” “interrelationships,” and perhaps “nec- essary evil,” one of the most important concepts brought to the fore in this  attempt is that man is readily fooled by appearances, that his ability to judge  between truth and falsehood is severely impaired. The gangster hit by a basket- ball assumes, incorrectly, that it was thrown at his back. The mother who sees  a syringe in her daughter’s hand becomes hysterical out of the sheer inability  to understand the circumstances. The wheelchair-bound wife assumes, incor- rectly, that the man who actually caught her husband’s fall is his attacker. This lack of clarity is part and parcel of the human condition as portrayed  in the story of Adam and Eve. Maimonides explains that at first man’s nature  was one in which his intellect was perfect and consequently his ability to dis- cern between truth versus falsehood was perfect, whereas after his eating from  the tree this clarity became impaired.15 “Through the intellect man distin- 15R.

This faculty Adam possessed perfectly  and completely. . . . [H]owever, when he began to give way to desires, which  had their source in his imagination, and to the gratification of his bodily ap- petites . . . he was punished by the loss of part of that intellectual faculty which  he had previously possessed” (Guide, 1:2, p.15).16 Attempt III—Harmony  After this second attempt, which ended in total disaster, the DJ realizes that  orchestrating man’s world is not at all a simple task. And whereas after the  first attempt he realized that the people—in their current positions—must be  taken into account, he now realizes that the each individual is not simply an  entity of the present, but is rather the product of his aggregate history. Con- sequently, he now analyzes each and every person from his or her beginnings  till the present. The notion that a person is not merely what he appears at that present but  rather the expression of the total accumulation of all the moments experienced  to that point, is discussed by nineteenth-century French philosopher Henri  Bergson, who explains that “no two moments are identical in a conscious be- ing.”17 This is because the present moment in the individual consists of all the  moments that came before it, and so the next moment will be different as it  contains all those moments as well as the last one that transpired.18 R. Soloveitchik explains that this perspective on time is of great impor- tance for man’s self-actualization. Man must realize that he is not only liv- ing the moment but that he is also participating in a great chain of events  is hence constantly trapped in a great quagmire wherein his actions switch from good to  bad and bad to good, man for the most part being unable to discern between the two. Simi- larly, the Ohr HaHayim (Ber. 3:7), paraphrasing the Gemara (Sotah 3a), explains that man  does not commit a transgression unless his “intellectual eyes were occluded,” i.e., at the root  of man’s negative act is his inability to perceive clearly the difference between good and bad.  Man’s greatest challenge is discerning right from wrong, as seen by King David’s request for  “wisdom to fear God,” i.e., to know right from wrong (Zohar Bereishit 59a). 16R. Soloveitchik explains that Maimonides does not distinguish between the con- trasting pairs of “truth v. falsehood” and “good v. bad.” Rather what is denoted as “true” in  the cognitive realm is referred to as “good” in the ethical realm.  Man’s sin was the rejection  of the true and the good ( Joseph B. Soloveitchik, Worship of the Heart [ Jersey City: Ktav,  2009], pp. 46–47).  17Henri Bergson, The Creative Mind, tr. Mabelle L.

However, this time, after letting the  scene start to play and applying the first control to the basketball, he does not  immediately pack up, he does not detach himself from the machinations of  the scene—he now realizes that he must also dedicate his complete and un- divided attention to insure its harmonious conclusion. As the scene unfolds,  he watches, at first with deep concern and trepidation and then finally with  content satisfaction, as his third attempt to bring the scene to a happy ending  is successful.  The basketball is made to roll gently into the side of the old man’s foot.  He picks up the ball and begins to bounce it. The break-dancer is inspired by  the rhythm of the bouncing ball, to which he choreographs a new dance. The  little girl is intrigued by the dance and walks over to view it close up. Along her  path, she passes naively between the gangsters, of whose baleful intentions she  is oblivious. They, for their part, are moved by her innocence and relent from  their pernicious plans. As one of the gangsters is walking away, the bicyclist  lightly swipes him, swerves, and then skids to a halt into the businessman.  The businessman’s food goes flying—something which the DJ keeps in  tight control—and then bounces off the face of a young man. The food catches  the eye of a young woman’s dog that runs to the food, and as a result, the young  woman follows. This then brings the two young people together in a serendipi- tous moment which both innocently pick up on. Here we see R. Akiva’s princi- ple that “[w]hatever the All-Merciful does is for the good,” the point being that  even the bad that occurs in this world (e.g., the biker hitting the businessman  and knocking his food), though assuredly bad within its immediate context,  must be understood as eventuating in some good in the final analysis. 19David Shapiro, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik on Pesah, Sefirat Ha-Omer and Shavu’ot,  ( Jerusalem: Urim, 2005), p. 151. 20R. Soloveitchik, “Sacred and Profane,” in Shiurei HaRav ( Jersey City, NJ: Ktav,  1994), pp. 15–18. Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="11">  Spin Explained ♦ 55 After the couple comes together, the DJ continues his control, perhaps giv- ing expression to the Gemara (Sotah 2a) which teaches that “bringing couples  together is harder than splitting the Red Sea.”21 Thus, even though the couple  has met, continued providential involvement is imperative to insure the match.  In the meantime, the old man has now found new vigor in his fascina- tion with the basketball, and while playing with it, his wheelchair-bound wife  looks at him thoughtfully. The DJ asserts his control now by increasing a “lev- el” bar, perhaps raising the temperature, for at this the old woman removes her  shawl. She then proceeds to stand up out of her wheelchair, something clearly  phenomenal given the look of wonder on her husband’s face. Here then is  demonstrated that the miraculous, though within the realm of providence, is  dependent on man’s responding to the call. The elderly couple now begins a slow dance, the simple beauty of which  apparently catches the eye of the drug-dealer. As he looks around he also no- tices two of the gangsters helping the mother pick up her fallen groceries, and  the young man and woman exchanging pleasantries, as well as the bicyclist and  businessman in friendly interaction. The drug-dealer, with a face of confusion  and indecision, looks long and hard at the wad of bills in his hand, and after  another look around in deep thought, places the entire sum in the collection  jar of the break-dancer. Among the powerful factors that serve to influence man’s choice are the  people surrounding him and the choices they have made. This point is made  vividly by the drug-dealer’s contemplation over what to do with his money.  The social interactions surrounding him are shown to influence him to the  point where he decides to perform an act of altruism that resonates with the  world around him. Maimonides explains that “it is the nature of man to be  drawn after the thoughts and actions of his friends and acquaintances, and to  act like the people of his country.”22 He quotes King Solomon who teaches,  “He who walks with the wise grows wise, but a companion of fools suffers  harm” (Proverbs 13:20). Fate &amp; Free Will As noted previously, the first two attempts depicting the “domino effect” argue  for determinism, whether it be “hard” or “soft.” However, the human condi- 21Though the Gemara conjectures that this applies to second marriages, many under- stand this to apply to all unions (See Tos.,Sotah 2a, s.v. ha; Akeidat Yitzhak, Vayeshev). 22Hil.

There are still a great many factors which much be  maintained under constant control, as demonstrated by the DJ’s intricate fine- tuning of his last attempt. This then leads us to another conclusion: though  there may not be pure determinism, there is pure fate dictated from on high,  the DJ “playing God,” as it were. That is to say, whereas determinism holds  that everything follows naturally from an initial event, here we see “fate” as an  invisible hand manipulating events to their desired conclusion.  The Zohar (Shmot 6a) and the Gemara (Moed Katan 28a) teach that  “[t]hree things depend not on the merit of our actions, but on fate: the length  of our life, our children, and our finances.” The Zohar (Miketz 198a) goes  even further, noting that “nothing happens in the world that does not depend  on fate.”23 This, however, cannot mean to imply that the world does not allow  for free will, for man’s very nature is predicated on his being able to choose,24  as God sets forth, “I place before you life and death, blessing and curse, choose  life” (Dev. 30:19). It is this aspect of man, of being able to exercise his free will,  which distinguishes him from both animal and angel.25 But if everything is fated, how is that man can exercise his free will? The  Gemara provides the answer succinctly: “All is in the hands of heaven, except  for the fear of heaven” (Ber. 33b). Thus, while man is placed in situations not  of his making, he is nevertheless free to apply himself and choose whether  he will act morally or not. Furthermore, the “fated” circumstances man finds  himself in are not made up of some ruthless blind fate but are rather dictated  by a will outside of man’s purview—“in the hands of heaven.” R. Soloveitchik  explains, “There is no deterministic fate; all operates on a transcendental plane  which is beyond the grasp of man’s finite mind.”26 The DJ, as he tries to emulate the Divine order, plays with the “fate” cir- cumstances, but nevertheless it is clearly man who decides what to do with  23See fn. 26. 24Rambam (Shemoneh Perakim, ch. 8; Hil. Deot, ch. 6); Rambam (Hil. Teshuva 5:1- 4); Ramchal (Derech Hashem, 2:2:3). 25Rambam (Hil. Tesh. 5:1); Ramchal (Derech Hashem, 2:1:3). By “angel” here I refer  to the normative heavenly angel whose mission it is to unwaveringly perform the will of the  Creator, as opposed to the fallen angels that acquired the same evil inclination as man. 26Joseph B. Soloveitchik, Reflections of the Rav ( Jersey City, NJ: Ktav, 1993), Vol. I, p.  48. This is the explanation of the Zohar (Miketz 198a) which stated that “all is fate.” Matok  Midevash brings the explanation of “Hazal,” who state that the intent is not the “fate of the  stars,” but rather the “fate of God.” Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="13">  Spin Explained ♦ 57 those circumstances, upon which the DJ correspondingly guides the situation  as necessary. The following verse in Job describes this interplay: “And they  are turned round about by His devices, according to their [man’s] work” ( Job  37:12). The Zohar (Vayera 109a-110a) explains that we learn from this that  God is constantly “turning the wheel of events,” manipulating our world in  order to allow for the maximum growth of each individual as well as that of  the world. However, “all is according to [man’s] work”; that is, the “fate” cir- cumstances are varied according to the works and deeds of man, such that in  accordance with man’s works does God shape the course of events.27  The Zohar (Vayera 109a-110a) goes on to describe how God guides the  events of the world, like a “potter” spinning His divine potter’s wheel—which  is His judgment. “And all is done in accordance with man’s works. If they are  good, the wheel revolves to the right, making the course of events highly favor- able to them. . . . Should men turn to evil ways the Holy One imparts to His  device a spin to the left, . . . and the wheel gives to events a course unfavorable to  the sons of men. So it goes on until they become penitent.” The DJ’s spinning  of the turntables to guide man’s actions toward perfection provides an uncanny  modernization of the ancient “potter’s wheel” metaphor found in the Zohar.  Also made clear through the various attempts of the DJ is that in order  to properly guide the course of events to their positive outcome, a great many  parameters not self evident must be taken into account, something that only  an omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent being such as God could pos- sibly do. Indeed, the angel runs away from the enormity of such a task. “The  Highest wisdom, however, perceives and knows what is best to rectify all cre- ation. In its profound design, it weighs everything together, and directs each  individual element of creation accordingly.”28 27See also Ramchal (Derech Hashem, 1:5:4), who explains that there are determinis- tic influences directed from above (God) to below, and there are indeterminate influences  directed from below (man’s free will) to above. 28Derech Hashem 2:3:1. See also Derech Hashem, 1:5:6. With this understanding of  the Divine will manipulating the “fate” circumstances of man’s life we can better explain that  initial statements on fate. Lifespan, children, and finances, being part of the fate order, are the  general circumstances to which man is born, which have nothing to do with man’s actions;  they represent a general order with which man must mediate in applying his moral choices.  The point of the statement that “nothing happens that does not depend on fate” is that the  “fate” order of things, to which man is not privy to but which God controls, are to provide  man with the maximum potential for growth. That is, “fate,” is beyond man’s control, but not  beyond God’s.

That is, he must be placed in an environment which con- tains the possibility of both good and evil.29 Thus God explains that this world  is one of a dual nature—“I form light and create darkness, I make peace and  create evil, I the Lord do all these things” (Isaiah 45:7).  Our world is a world based on imperfection, a place where bad things are  going to happen.30 This is most blatantly expressed in that the DJ, for all his  efforts to manipulate events to achieve harmony, never attempts to stop the  basketball from falling. If the DJ were to resort to this device, he would have  to continue on rewinding history until he would have to rewind the very act of  creation when “[i]n the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth; and  the earth was chaos and void” (Gen. 1:1–2).  Creation is established on an earth of “chaos and void.” It is the nature of  our world that the ball must fall. The clip fundamentally starts on this prem- ise—as the ball irretrievably drops—and the clip ends, to the chagrin of the  DJ, on this premise—as the doll falls and breaks. And though the DJ does  repair the doll, it is abundantly clear that this is merely a concession to a little  girl and not a lasting change. In order for man to be man and not angel, he was created with the poten- tial for good as well as for evil, and he was placed in an environment where- in he could exercise that potential for the good or the bad.31 It is man’s task  in creation to choose good over evil, and in so doing, “perfect creation.” And  whereas the DJ runs away in frustration over the incessancy of the task, man is  instructed that he must ever persevere though he may not in fact complete the  task, as it says, “the task is not for you to finish, neither are you free to desist  from it” (Avot 2:16).32 The Zohar (Zohar Hadash, Ber. 9b) finds reference to the notion that  man is to perfect creation in that upon creating man, God stopped creating.  29See fn. 31. 30D. Birnbaum (God and Evil, p. 91) explains that “unleashed natural evil” is a neces- sary corollary to “higher potential for moral good, moral evil.” 31Ramchal, Derech Hashem, 1:2:4, 1:3:1, 2:2:2. 32This verse is interpreted to apply specifically to the task of learning Torah; however,  we can also understand “learning Torah” in the larger sense of doing so with the goal of  perfecting Creation. Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="15">  Spin Explained ♦ 59 He thus told man, as it were, “Until now I have been striving in creative work,  from now on you must strive in it.”33 Furthermore, man is to carry a symbol  of this partnership with God on his very flesh, as the Midrash (Ber. R. 11:6)  relates of a philosopher who asked R. Hoshaya, “If circumcision is so favorable  in God’s eyes, why wasn’t man born circumcised?” R. Hoshaya replied that ev- erything in the world requires man’s efforts: plants must be sweetened, wheat  must be ground, and even man himself requires perfecting.34 Circumcision  thus symbolizes the need for man to effect change in the world, to perfect the  world, even unto the very flesh which God Himself formed.35  Anything Helps God  Toward this goal of perfecting the world, every good deed, every positive act,  contributes and counts in immeasurable ways. The Gemara (Kiddushin 40a)36  explains: An individual should always view himself as if he has [all his actions on a scale,  wherein] half are negative and half are positive—for the world [in toto] is judged  according to the majority [of deeds], and the individual is judged according to  the majority [of his deeds], if he does one positive act he tips the balance of his  deeds, and indeed that of the world, to the positive. This idea is illustrated in the clip where the break-dancer’s sign asking for  contributions reads: “Anything Helps.” Indeed, any act, no matter how small,  contributes to the overall harmony of the world. Who would have imagined  that a harmonious dance37 would attract the curiosity of a little girl, whose  innocent stroll through dangerous individuals would melt their hardened  hearts, which would subsequently influence a drug-dealer to give charity. And  the act of charity, equated to all the good acts in the Torah, is the epitome of  33“And He rested from His work which he created to do” (Ber. 2:3). On the last words  “to do” the Midrash (Tanhuma [Buber], Ber. 17) explains that God left for man “to do,” “to  complete,” His creation, which will be achieved through the building of the Beit HaMik- dash which symbolizes peace and harmony on earth. See especially Pesikta Rabati (Piska  6, vateshalem), Yalkut Shimoni (Melachim I, 186) which talk of Solomon’s building the  Temple as the completion intended by the words “to do” (la’asot). 34Similarly Midrash Tanhuma (Tazria 5). 35See Sefer HaHinuch, Parshat Lech, Mitzvah #2. 36Also Zohar (Bo 33b). 37Note that Judaism very much values the aesthetic gesture as one that is part and par- cel of man’s fixing the world. See my article “Halacha, Ethics, and Aesthetics,” The Everett  Journal of Jewish Ethics (Winter 2008).  Vol. 28, No. 2   ♦   2010 </page> <page sequence="16"> 60 ♦ Mois Navon     the altruistic perfecting act.38 Appropriately, the clip uses as the final good  deed, in the sequence of good deeds done by the characters in the scene, the  ultimate good deed of charity. The break-dancer’s sign also contains the phrase “God Bless”; however,  this phrase is divided over two lines where the word “God” is actually in line  with the phrase “Anything Helps.” As such, the line reads: “Anything Helps  God,” which really expresses a deep understanding of man’s partnership with  God in His creation. For in man’s effort to perfect the world he is actually  completing God’s creation, he is thus helping God Himself!39 To this end the  Zohar (Bo 33a) states that when man performs good deeds in an effort to  achieve perfection he gives “strength” to God. And on the verse “Charity saves  from death” (Proverbs 10:2), the Zohar (Behukotai 113b) explains that the  act of charity saves not only man from death but even God Himself. For char- ity is the quintessential act of bringing harmony and peace to the world, and  as such, brings completion to the act of creation, or in the words of the Zohar,  “completes God’s name.”40   On a mystical level, R. David Aaron explains that, though God by defini- tion is perfect (static perfection), He chose to participate in the process of be- coming perfect (dynamic perfection), which He does through man’s struggle  for perfection.41 The way to this perfection is provided by God in His Torah,  with its myriad of commandments, which is to serve as a guidebook to per- fection. This idea is illustrated in the Gemara (Shabbat 88b) wherein Moses  convinces the angels of his need to bring the Torah from its heavenly repository  down to earth. Moses argues that since the book is filled with guidance for man  in need of perfection it rightly belongs in the hands of man, not angels. Simi- larly the Gemara (Kiddushin 30b) calls the Torah a “tavlin” and explains that  the Torah is to be used by man to overcome his negative tendencies in his effort  38Baba Batra 9a. The Maharal (Comm. to Aggadot HaShas [on Baba Batra 9a]; Netiv  HaTzedaka 4) teaches that charity is symbolic of all good and righteous acts in that its very  name, in Hebrew, “tzedaka,” means righteousness, the goal of all the commandments. 39Zohar (Beshalach 57b)—When God exiled the people He “lost” and when He sends  the Mashiach, He “saves” Himself. 40See esp. Matok Midvash (Behukotai 113b, pp. 735–36). 41R. David Aaron, The Secret Life of God (Boston: Shambhala, 2005), pp. 14–15.

The Zohar (Behukotai 113b) explains that man, by perfect- ing the world, perfects the upper realms which directly influence nature such  that the world itself is blessed with all material goodness (e.g., proper rain,  full crops, abundant fruit). Indeed the Torah (Dev. 7:12–16) enumerates the  blessings that follow due obedience to God’s will that include all manner of  goodness: physical health and well-being, economic prosperity, national se- curity. These material rewards, however, are not to be seen as “payment” but  rather as “improvement of conditions” as a result of man’s perfecting the world.  Indeed, this is how Rambam (Hil. Tesh. 9:1) explains such rewards: [God] has promised us in the Torah, that if we observe its behests joyously and  cheerfully, and continually meditate on its wisdom, He will remove from us the  obstacles that hinder us in its observance, such as sickness, war, famine, and oth- er calamities; and will bestow upon us all material benefits which will strengthen  our ability to fulfill the Law, such as plenty, peace, abundance of silver and gold.  Thus we will not be engaged all our days in providing for our bodily needs, but  will have the leisure to study wisdom and fulfill the commandments, and thus  attain life in the World to Come. By demonstrating the desire to fulfill God’s will, He does not “pay” man,  but rather provides the correspondingly appropriate set of conditions ideally  conducive for man to grow in fulfilling that will.  Conclusion  The movie provides a profound look at the human condition, at man’s im- broglio in a world of good and evil wherein, by exercising his free will for the  good, man participates in the perfection of an imperfect world. It is this fun- damental principle of creation that the angels could not countenance. Pure in  their creation, the concept of evil, of going against the will of the Creator, lay  42Worthy of note is that the Gemara explains that if God did not help man in his  effort to perfect himself he would never succeed. Maharasha (Kiddushin 30b, s.v. yitzro)  explains that this does not violate the concept that “everything is in the hands of heaven  except for the fear of heaven,” for one only merits the divine assistance upon expressing his  will to perfection—“haba litaheir mesayin oto.” 43Aaron, The Secret Life of God, p. 49, [emphasis added].

In response to this lack of understand- ing, and the disdain it so engendered, the angels were thrown to earth to learn  for themselves. The story of the fallen angels comes as an object lesson to any and all who  might take such a position and ask of God, how could you create a world with  the possibility of evil, how could you create such a creature as man with the  propensity for evil? Of all the difficult philosophical questions man can raise,  that of theodicy ranks as the most intractable for the believer in a good God.  The answer, as explained, is that only through the possibility of evil can man  rise in partnership with his Creator to eradicate evil.44 This then is the paradox  of creation—for there to be perfection, there must be imperfection, for there  to be value to virtue, vice must be an option. This lesson is of such critical importance that it is given central promi- nence on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year, in arguably the most dra- matic ritual of the day. In the midst of the various rituals, two identical goats  are selected as offerings, one to God and the other as a scapegoat sent off a  desert precipice called Azazel. The Gemara (Yoma 67b) teaches that Azazel  was so named because the ritual obtains atonement for the affair of the fallen  angels Uza and Aza’el.  The angels’ fell because they could not fathom the inherent necessity of  evil in the world, and more important, they could not tolerate man’s imperfect,  even sinful, nature. The episode of their entry into the world taught clearly  that such an attitude will prove ruinous, as demonstrated by the angels’ decline  to debauchery. Rather one must recognize evil; that is, one must recognize  evil’s role in creation as the very vehicle through which man strives to achieve  perfection by its elimination.  On this holiest of days, when man is busy making atonement for his fail- ures at fulfilling his role in achieving perfection,45 he is also to make atonement  for the mistake of not recognizing the role of evil in the world. Indeed, it may  very well be that it was this lack of understanding that led to his current per- sonal failures, as it did for the angels. Man’s ambition to achieve good and shun  all evil is a path fatally flawed—for man must utilize even that which is “evil” to- ward the goal of perfection, as the Talmud (Ber. 54a) states, that one must serve  God “with both your hearts: your good inclination and your evil inclination.”46 44See D. Birnbaum, God and Evil ( Jersey City, NJ: Ktav, 1989). 45Lev. 16:30. 46Degel Mahaneh Efraim (Bo) notes that Tefillin contain the name “Paro” to indicate  this concept. Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="19">  Spin Explained ♦ 63 To this failure comes the scapegoat cast to Azazel. This most enigmatic  of offerings has been explained to be a kind of acknowledgement to Satan.47  Ramban (Lev. 16:8) explains that the idea of the “scapegoat to Satan” is that  we pay homage to the force of evil which is part of God’s creation.48 The atone- ment, then, of the affair of the fallen angels, is to “give Satan his due,” to ac- knowledge that the world is based on evil, and that perfection is our life-long  task, indeed the very raison d’etre of creation.49 It is to recognize the irony in  creation, that to be rid of evil, one must acknowledge the role of evil. “This,”  explains the Zohar (Bo 34a), “is a deep tenet of faith.”  The angelic position on man is expressed as, “What is man that you are  mindful of him?” (Psalms 8:5). However the very next statement in the Psalm  asserts, “You have made him a bit lower than the angels, and crowned him  with Your glory and honor. . . . You have put all things at his feet” (Psalms  8:6–7). The verses together convey the paradox that, on the one hand it would  seem man is really not worthy of attention, yet on the other hand man has  nevertheless been placed at the pinnacle of creation.50 The resolution to the  contradiction lies in what man makes of himself.51 Man was created imperfect, and as such, lower than the angels; however,  man has the potential to achieve perfection, something unattainable even by  angels. It is only by seeking to actualize that potential that man makes him- self worthy of God’s attention. Man’s perfection is wholly dependent on the  exercising of his free will toward the good by overcoming his inherent negative  inclination. This, teaches the Talmud (Kid. 30b), is done by employing the  Torah as guidebook. At the center of the book lies a fundamental principle  47Pirke DeRebbi Eliezer, ch. 46. Also Zohar (Bo 33a). 48And not in sacrifice to some foreign, or independent, power. 49Rashi (Yoma 67b, s.v. uza) states that the atonement was for the angels’ turning to  sexual immorality; however the Gevurat Ari (s.v. shemechaper) wonders how this can be,  given that the scapegoat atones for much more than this. Perhaps we could say that since  sexuality is the primary seduction of the yetzer hara (Zohar Vay. 15b), thus atonement for  this sin represents atonement for the yetzer hara and all the evil that it represents—for  indeed “the Satan is the yetzer hara” (Baba Batra 15a). 50See Radak (Ps. 8:7), Metzudat David (Ps. 8:7). 51See Joseph B. Soloveitchik, Halachic Man ( Jerusalem: Sefer Ve Sefel, 2005), pp.  68–70.  Vol. 28, No. 2   ♦   2010 </page> <page sequence="20"> 64 ♦ Mois Navon     which R. Akiva52 and Hillel53 taught to be the essence of man’s task of perfec- tion: “Love your neighbor as yourself ” (Lev. 19:18).  So too, this short but powerful clip, though dense with deep philosophical  motifs and messages, submits as its ultimate message the Bible’s golden ethic  of “Love your neighbor as yourself.” As shown, man is highly interconnected  and individuals influence each other in ways beyond the wildest imagination.  Furthermore, man is often unable to discern the truth, and therefore should  tend to give the benefit of the doubt—in the words of the Mishna, “Judge your  neighbor favorably” (Avot 1:6). Bearing these ideas in mind should go a long  way in helping to achieve peace and harmony. If man is to banish evil and to  achieve harmony on earth, it will only be through the concerted attempt to  achieve the golden ethic. This lofty ideal is as beautiful as it is impractical,  nevertheless it is something we can achieve in even the smallest of acts, for  “Anything Helps.” And though this task is greater than even an angel can ac- complish, it is eminently in our hands.  52Ber. R. 24:7, Yerushalmi Ned. 9:4 (30b), Yal. Shimoni (Ber. 40). Note also that even  though Ben Azzai states that “[t]hese are the Generations of Man” is a greater principle, his  point, as elaborated by R. Tanhum, is also that the ultimate goal is to love one’s neighbor,  but he is concerned that one may not love oneself enough; for this reason he exhorts that  man should love one’s neighbor because the individual is a creation of God (as implied in  his source verse).
