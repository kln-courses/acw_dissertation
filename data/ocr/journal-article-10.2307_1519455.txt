<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK LIST lImr. Also considered is multiple embedding of DD, and a section is devoted to the etymology of ne'um, for which the author provides a novel and acceptable solution (pp. 298-308). In the summary conclusions (pp. 323-6) the author stresses the degree of diver- sity shown in the way DD is marked. He notes, too, that "the unique contribution that l'mr makes to syntax is to identify unequivocally the very next word as DD" (p. 326). There are six appendices, in effect, footnotes which are too long to fit where they really belong. The most interesting are Appendix C on brk, "to bless", and F on qr', "to call, summons", though neither makes any reference to the use of these verbs outside Hebrew. A bibliography and an index to the OT texts cited are provided. Although throughout the book there is reference, often extensive, to com- parative material from the ancient Near East, particularly Akkadian and Ugaritic, there is still room for further work in this area. It would also be interesting to com- pare Meier's work with G. Goldenberg, "On Direct Speech and the Hebrew Bible", in K. Jongeling, H.L. Murre-van den Berg and L. Van Rompay (ed.), Studies in Hebrew and Aramaic Syntax (Leiden, etc., 1991), pp. 79-96. Since, accord- ing to Meier, "narration in the Hebrew Bible takes a back-seat to dialogue" and "DD is the primary mover of plot" (p. 162), the significance of this book is evi- dent, particularly as it corrects many commonly held assumptions.

The introduction (of 27 pages) discusses the word mesdlim and the book of Proverbs; the Gattungen; the authors; the collections within the book of Proverbs; Wisdom literature in general (including that of Mesopotamia and Egypt); theology; the date of the final redaction (probably early in the Greek period); and canonicity. At the end of the book, after the commen- tary, there is a bibliography (the abbreviations are not explained, but the reader is referred to a different work; this is unsatisfactory, for a book should be self- sufficient), and a subject index. The commentary on the text reflects fresh thought and careful study of both the individual proverbs and the collections, and it is of sufficient length to allow a fair amount of space for discussion, and the comments provide, in general, excellent exegesis of the text. Meinhold was, however, limited in what he could say by the nature of the series in which the commentary appears, which does not allow for much discussion of textual and philological questions. Yet so much in this particular book of the O.T. depends on the text and translation of individual verses that it is impossible to do full justice to exegesis without discussing such matters. So it is that Meinhold renders lesim as "die Hochmiitigen" (probably rightly), and recognizes that teholel in xxv 23 may (more probably, should) be translated "vertreibt", but does not explain these renderings in detail. More questionably, he thinks that dmo'n in viii 30 should be read as a passive participle and translates it "Pflegekind", but he does not explain why the participle is not feminine like meiaheqet later in the same verse. Similarly, he translates yismdh in xiii 9 as "ist freudig", aal-tere' in xxiii 31 as "Betrachte ... nicht", and hazo'n in xxix 18 as "Vision" without mentioning alternative renderings. It is a pity that the character of the series imposed con- straints on so thorough a commentator as Meinhold. Fortunately, however, this concerns only a minority of proverbs, and most of what this admirable commen- tary has to say is not affected. [J.A.E.] A. MEINHOLD and R. Lux (ed.), Gottesvolk.

Most of the essays in this Festschrift for Siegfried Wagner are arranged in pairs dealing respectively with an 141</page><page sequence="2">142 BOOK LIST O.T. and an N.T. aspect of a given topic within the general theme of the people of God. Attention is here limited to those on O.T. topics. E.-J. Waschke sketches a doctrine of election; M. K6ckert studies the theme of Yahweh, Israel and the land with particular attention to the books of Amos and Hosea; J. Conrad discusses the differing attitudes to kingship and the state, under the topic of wor- ship; H. Seidel traces the theme of praise in heaven and on earth from the O.T. through to the intertestamental and Qumran literature; and H.H. Schmid reflects in more homiletical style on the limits of human responsibility as presented in J's primeval history. Individual essays at the end of the volume include an outline of the theology ofJeremiah by S. Herrmann, a study of the people of God in Malachi by A. Meinhold, and an examination of the same theme in the "historical" psalms (lxxviii, cv, cvi, cxxxv, cxxxvi) by D. Mathias. [H.G.M. WILLIAMSON] C.H.J. VAN DER MERWE, The Old Testament particle gam. A syntactic-semantic Description of gam in Gn-2Kg. Arbeiten zu Text und Sprache im Alten Testament 34. xi + 228 pp. Eos Verlag, St Ottilien, 1990. DM 45. Although this book is a revision of the author's dissertation (1988) at Stellenbosch, much of the research was undertaken at Munich, and it follows closely the methods and form of presen- tation pioneered by W. Richter. Van der Merwe is aware that many other scholars find this to be "user-unfriendly" (p. 23), but he believes that it alone provides the necessary theoretical framework for a linguistically scientific description of Old Hebrew. After briefly pointing out the inadequacies of previous treatment of gam, introducing some theoretical considerations and discussing "emphasis" and "focus" in general, van der Merwe works through every occurrence of gam in Genesis, first descriptively and then in terms of its connections with other words and word groups. Finally, the different functional classes of gam in Genesis to 2 Kings are described. It is reassuring to find that, among his conclusions, he is able to state "Gam almost always has an additive, inclusive or at least a connective con- notation" (p. 198). [H.G.M. WILLIAMSON] J. MILGROM, Leviticus 1-16: A New Translation with Introduction and Commen- tary. Anchor Bible 3. Doubleday, New York, etc., 1991. $42. Milgrom's acknowledged expertise in Israelite ceremonial laws makes him an especially suitable commentator on Leviticus, and the length of this volume (only the first of two on Leviticus) gives him full scope to expound his understanding of this O.T. book. The introduction (pp. 1-67) considers the name, scope and text of the book and describes Milgrom's method, which "belongs, in the main, to the school of redaction criticism. It is characterized by synchronic rather than diachronic analysis" (p. 2). The historical aspect of study is not, however, ignored. Arguments are advanced for a pre-exilic date of the Priestly writer, and it is also maintained that "the school of H is later than P; indeed, H is P's redactor" (p. 13). H, in turn, is dated "at the end of the eighth century" (p. 28), apart from later additions, which are not later than the end of the exile (p. 27). There follow discussions of the vocabulary, style and structure; the Priestly theology; the priest; anthropomorphism and revelation; the composition of Lev. i-xvi; and commen- tators. There is a bibliography of sixty pages. The commentary that follows offers a detailed discussion of the text, including such questions-to mention but a few-as the leaning of the hand on the head of a sacrificial victim (by "process of elimination, ownership is the only theory remaining", p. 152); the purpose of sacrifice (the theory that it is "a gift to the deity to induce his aid" is "the only one that manifests validity in all sacrificial systems", p. 441); why it is forbidden to boil a kid in its mother's milk ("A substance that maintains the life of a creature ... should not be fused or confused with a process associated with death", p. 741); and the meaning of sdraCat ("the identification ... is uncertain" but "these diseases ... share one feature in common: they produce scales.
