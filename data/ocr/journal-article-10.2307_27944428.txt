<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gordon Kaufman: A Theological Journey from Agency to Creativity Nancy R. Ho well / Saint Paul School of Theology W 7 th great appreciation for Gordon Kaufman's influential body of VV work, I begin my reflection on his more recent In the beginning. . . Creativity, with two important points regarding the significance of the book's contributions to constructive theology. First, in a period when science-theology controversy is heating up in school boards and courts around the United States, Kaufman deliberately and splendidly continues to construct theology informed by scientific themes of origin and development. Second, Kaufman privileges readers to engage the process and progress of his thinking about God. He invites us to entertain both the methodological clarity and autobiographical candor supporting the ever-constructive movement of his imaginative theological proposals. In recognition of his monumental contributions to Christian theology, the following reflection continues the spirit of appreciative, imaginative inquiry with hope that the discussion draws Kaufman into expression of what may be left unsaid in the short book. The first discussion theme begins with praise for the integrative, inclusive, and pluralistic orientation of the book, which expresses sincere desire to construct an understanding of God respectful of feminist criticism of androcentric God-talk and desire for genuine dialogue between Christianity and the world's religions. In response to Kaufman's postmodern approach, I have interest in pursuing the deeper meanings and implications of his theological proposals. To begin deeper probing of the inclusive direction of Kaufman's book, I raise some methodological and theological questions. Sallie McFague makes the case that Christian theological language is metaphorical and that the root-metaphors in Christianity embody a mode of relationship.1 Thinking of Sallie McFague's claims about relational metaphors and Alfred North Whitehead's concept of creativity (both in terms of the ultimate associated with philosophy of 1 Sallie McFague, Metaphorical Theology: Models of God in Religious Language (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1982), 129.</page><page sequence="2">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 35 organism and in terms of its relational embodiment in creatures and God), I wonder whether serendipitous creativity expresses relationality and is proposed as a relational metaphor?2 Kaufman claims that serendipitous creativity is a promising way to understand God and the cosmic process.3 If serendipitous creativity is not a relational metaphor for God and the cosmic process, what new mode of imaging God is proposed? Because Christian metaphors for God often begin with human experience in search of concrete, but limited, relational ways of imagining God, how does serendipitous creativity maintain, transform, or dissolve some of the ways we understand the God-human relationship, to which Kaufman refers as a symbolic polarity behind "a deep structure that informs and orders our self-consciousness, our experience, and many of our activities."4 Here, I note that Kaufman clearly suggests that Christianity should "reconstruct the two interrelated symbols of God and humanity in ways that will enable them to orient and guide our lives more appropriately and effectively," at the same time avoiding the abuses of the divine-human construct that have led to human brutality.5 Perhaps my real question is, How is the divine human polarity reconstructed? Further to try to interpret the intention of the language of serendipitous creativity, I refer to McFague's claim that a multiplicity of models or dominant metaphors is necessary to describe God because adopting diverse metaphors prevents idolatry with regard to a single model (such as patriarchal or monarchical models) and expresses the depth and texture of the divine-human relationship.6 The multiplication of metaphors or models is often accomplished by developing or recognizing the supporting metaphors related to more prominent 2 Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality: An Essay in Cosmology, corrected edition, ed.

See Sallie McFague, Models of God: Theology for an Ecological, Nuclear Age (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1987), 38-39. In Models of God, McFague claims that "since no metaphor or model refers properly or directly to God, many are necessary." See also Sallie McFague, The Body of God: An Ecological Theology (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1993), 134. In The Body of God, McFague writes, "Everything can be a metaphor for God, because no one thing is God."</page><page sequence="3">36 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy models describing the God-human relationship. Given that Kaufman's concept of serendipitous creativity moves away from imaging God as person or moral agent (including male-gendered images), I am interested in whether Kaufman discourages all personal or anthropomorphic/centric metaphors for God or whether supporting metaphors, some of which might be appropriately contextualized personal metaphors (perhaps explicitly interpreting biblical or traditional metaphors in a new way), might function to elaborate the divine mysterious creativity. Such metaphors arising from human experience, I imagine, would necessarily be transformed by the larger model of serendipitous creativity. The questions and reflections stated so far raise no criticisms of Kaufman's proposal that serendipitous creativity expresses a constructive understanding of God, but simply explore the function of language and metaphor in his recent theological reflection. Another way of engaging Kaufman's inclusive and constructive theology pursues the praxis or concrete actions warranted by his constructive theological proposal. Such a move shifts the discussion from methodological interests to praxiological interests. The pragmatic and praxiological value of theological proposals rests in assurance that more abstract theological concepts respond actively to more concrete, particular experiences and social locations. One source inspiring discussion of Kaufman's proposal as active theology occurs in the closing lines of In the beginning . . . Creativity.7 Kaufman writes, "In my view, only as we give our lives in service (as Matt. 25:40 put it) to 'the least of these' little men and women on Earth, and to the processes that sustain all of Earth's structures, do we gain true human dignity and fulfillment."8 The sentence quoted calls attention to particular little ones/persons/processes. Another source encouraging the discussion derives from diverse liberation and contextual theologies, whose methodologies begin with particular lived experiences and whose critique of dominant, privileged theologies 7 I take the phrase active theology from C. S. Song who argues that theology must be action-oriented (and in Song's case, the argument is developed to say that theology must reflect divine love, which is love in action). Song's theological proposal, of course, is not directly related to Kaufman's theology.

In my estimation, Kaufman's theism expressed as serendipitous creativity has potential as a constructive alternative to dominant, oppressive theologies, which might serve in partnership with liberation and political theologies. Because In the beginning . . . Creativity does not explicitly explore such a partnership, I invite consideration of its potential as a liberative theology. How does serendipitous creativity introduce a new paradigm that confronts and unmasks classism, racism, or speciesism? What concrete example might illustrate how serendipitous creativity deconstructs privilege, such as whiteness (to name James Cone's and Emilie Townes's call to white theologians)? What concrete case might exemplify a new Christian way of being and behaving evoked by the metaphor of serendipitous creativity? What kind of response does serendipitous creativity require in relation to little men and women and Earth's processes? Reflection on how the abstract meets the concrete is critical for any of us who dream that a speculative, pragmatic, empirical, or naturalistic worldview might actually be important for orienting lives committed to justice, forgiveness, and reconciliation. In the beginning . . . Creativity occasionally refers to feminist theology and affirms feminist criticism of God-language.9 Kaufman's postmodern theological proposal is somewhat successful in supporting feminist critique; however, the discussion includes some emphasis on the concept of self-sacrifice, a theological concept that raises concerns for some feminist theologians. I admit some ambivalence in response to passages of In the beginning . . . Creativity, for example on pages 50 and 51. On one hand, I am drawn to Kaufman's concern for interconnectedness exemplified in "self-sacrificial love."10 He writes persuasively, These christic images and meanings remain compelling, however, for they reveal something of great importance to our alienated human life. Notions and stories of reconciliation, love, and peace, of self-giving, voluntary poverty, concern for our enemies, vicarious suffering, 9 Ibid., 21. In the reference cited, Kaufman refers to Mary Daly, Sallie McFague, Elisabeth Sch ssler Fiorenza, and Carol Christ. 10 Ibid., 50.</page><page sequence="5">38 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy point to our deep interconnectedness with each other. Thus they show the direction in which communities and individuals must move if our human world is ever to become more truly humane.11 Kaufman continues by connecting christic images and meanings with images of reconciliation suggested by Paul's phrase "members of one another" from Romans 12, and he associates images of reconciling community with the absence of "discrimination among groups, classes, races, or genders."12 Kaufman's vision for an ecological and evolutionary reconstruction and a humane, reconciling community is founded on a self-sacrificial Christ: In this context of hopes and dreams the image of the self-sacrificial Jesus, who gives himself completely and nonviolently so that all might have "abundant life" (as John 10:10 puts it), stands out in full significance. Here is a vivid emblem of the radical transvaluation of values that is required if our world of violence and aggressive self-assertion is ever to become more truly humane and thus more human.13 Certainly nothing is objectionable about the vision of reconciliation and humaneness, but feminist and womanist scholarship (as well as black liberation theology) is rather emphatic about the disproportionate expectation of self-sacrifice that the poor and marginalized suffer at the hands of the privileged so on the other hand, I find myself uncomfortable with the pivotal place of self-sacrifice in the christic model and in the reconstruction of humanity. Consequently I wonder what Kaufman's rationale for retaining the image of self-sacrifice is. How much does the christomorphic principle perpetuate self-sacrifice as an ideal? Because the cliristomoiphic principle is shaped by normative New Testament "christomorphic images, stories, and ideas," Kaufman proposes that human creativity "must be directed toward bringing goods into the world, not evils, toward healing, toward resolving disputes through 11 Ibid. 12 Ibid., 51. 13 Ibid.</page><page sequence="6">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 39 compromise and mediation, toward overcoming the destructive momentums we humans have already brought into the ecological order on planet Earth and into the historical order of human affairs."14 While the picture of human creativity guided by the christomorphic principle is a worthy goal requiring, as Kaufman suggests, a new orientation of human creativity and ethics and a new orientation toward God, the concept of self-sacrifice appears to rest in more traditional images of God, which are somewhat at odds with the images of justice advocated by feminist and womanist theologians.15 Is advocacy of self-sacrifice an indicator that Kaufman's theology retains some roots in traditional theological images, resulting in a somewhat uncomfortable fit between the theology of serendipitous creativity and compromising the response of his theological proposal to the marginalized with whom reconciliation is needed? Continuing to explore the extent of the inclusive, postmodern stance of In the beginning . . . Creativity, I have an interest in the relationship of humans and nature emerging in Kaufman's ecological and evolutionary reorientation. The theological proposal characterizes humans as biohistorical creatures, who are "beings shaped by both biological evolution and historical developments."16 The claim that humans are biohistorical beings raises the question, Are humans the only biohistorical beings or processes? The question occurs in the context of exploring the development of Kaufman's ideas since the much earlier book Systematic Theology: A Historicist Perspective, where a case is made for dissolving the nature-history dualism. He writes in Systematic Theology, "When we conceive the world as thus the expression of purposive activity as created, as providentially ordered, and as moving toward a final goal we are grasping the historical."17 One interpretation of Systematic Theology is that other beings in the world might also be considered biohistorical, and to hold such an interpretation might be wholly consistent with Kaufman's new theology of serendipitous creativity, even as the agential concepts of creation, providence, and teleology are confined to an earlier 14 Ibid., 61. Kaufman further characterizes the christomorphic principle on page 68. 15 Ibid., 68. 16 Ibid., 44. Kaufman describes humans as biohistorical beings on pages 42-45 and 94 100. 17 Gordon D. Kaufman, Systematic Theology: A Historicist Perspective (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1968), 258. The historical is understood by Kaufman to mean a concept larger than evolution alone (see n. 5 on page 258).</page><page sequence="7">40 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy theological construction. However, In the beginning . . . Creativity may reject the common biohistorical nature of humans and nature because, Kaufman claims, "All the way down to the deepest layers of our distinctively human existence, thus, we are not simply biological beings, animals; we are biohistorical beings . . . ,"18 If humans are distinctively biohistorical, Kaufman may be indicating that the nature history dualism must be deconstructed differently in light of the model of serendipitous creativity. The second discussion theme follows from the previous point and probes the deep meaning of serendipitous creativity as the metaphor directs attention to the mystery enfleshed in the christomorphic principle. The second line of discussion results from my own efforts to develop an orientation toward God conceived as creativity. In my effort to grasp the full meaning and development of serendipitous creativity (as distinct from the agential model of Kaufman's earlier theology), I find myself waffling across three ways of reading In the beginning. . . Creativity. The first way of reading creativity places the metaphor of serendipitous creativity at a distance from the agential model. Here serendipitous creativity is an abstracted concept, virtually pantheistic in nature and passively encompassing the collected or aggregate acts of agents and processes in the universe. See, for example, page 74: Thinking of God as creativity (rather than as "the Creator") forces us to take the profundity of God's mystery to a deeper level. For "creativity" is simply a name with which we identify this profound mystery of new realities coming into being; it is in no way an explanation of it.19 The sentence certainly strips theism of personalistic or agential attributes, and the focus shifts to emergence of beings apart from divine causation or explanation. A second way of reading creativity might resonate with Mary Daly's early description of God as Verb of Verbs.20 In a sense, God 18 Kaufman, In the beginning. .. Creativity, 44. 19 Ibid., 74. 20 Mary Daly, Beyond God the Father: Toward a Philosophy of Women's Liberation (Boston: Beacon Press, 1973), 9, 34.</page><page sequence="8">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 41 might be understood as verbal, acting or creating itself apart from any concept of God as actor or agent. See, for example, page 103 of In the beginning. . . Creativity: I have suggested repeatedly in this book that it is not appropriate to reify creativity in any way, or to attribute it to some "being" (such as a creator conceived as an independent quasi-person); for it is precisely this developing activity [Kaufman's emphasis] (creativity) that should itself be thought of as God.21 An interpretation of the sentence suggests that serendipitous creativity is the mystery of the arising, emerging activity that results in beings who constitute the evolutionary ecology of the Earth. The activity is verbal rather than subjective or agential. A third way of reading creativity retains some notions of agency in the non-personal, non-agential actor called God. Read, for example, from pages 101-2: That is, God (creativity) apparently is always and everywhere active in some degree and some respect a theologically momentous conclusion. In all of this, it should be clear, God is to be distinguished from everything created. . . . God's activity, though always creative, apparently changes (and grows?) in time in distinctive ways appropriate to the context in which God is acting. And thus God also apparently grows and changes.22 Kaufman's footnote indicates a connection with Alfred North Whitehead's dipolar theism in the above passage, but in a different expression of creativity than the two previous examples, Kaufman associates God with creative activity and suggests that "God is acting."23 At stake in the comparison of statements about creativity is understanding how far the theological journey from agent to mystery to serendipitous creativity has taken Kaufman. 21 Kaufman, In the beginning. . . Creativity, 103. 22 Ibid., 101-2. 23 Ibid, 102.</page><page sequence="9">42 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy With the three ways of reading creativity or interpreting God as serendipitous creativity, I am seized by a desire to understand more about the model of God and God's relationship with the world. In a sense, Kaufman leaves a few mysteries in the theological proposal (perhaps intentionally), but the proposal opens the way for a number of questions. First, are notions of divine immanence and transcendence meaningful and important, or is their meaning vaporized in the divine mystery? What shall we make of claims that God as "mystery of creativity ... is itself unqualified, is absolute" alongside the proposal that God (creativity3) "seems to be in certain respects a creation of creativity2" (which Kaufman defines as the complex creative, evolutionary processes of the universe)?24 How limited or large a concept is the rejected notion of person that Kaufman dissociates from God? (Here I think about the difference between traditional notions of person and Whitehead's broader notion of personhood.) How shall we understand the symbolic polarity of God and humans in light of the polarity of the encompassing symbol of creativity?25 What is the "scale of God" that veils God in mystery, and how shall Christians (and others) live into the "much vaguer and less vivid" human relationships with God?26 24 Ibid., 103, 101. 25 Ibid., 34. The question arises from a question posed by Kaufman: "What if the traditional meaning of the two symbols, God and human, which give this polarity its basic content and significance however, important, appropriate, and effective they have been in ordering the lives of many generations before our time are no longer as pertinent as they were in the past to major problems that humans must today address?" Ibid., 67. The question arises from Kaufman's intriguing statement: God also (and God's "eternity") if God is to be thought of as the creativity manifest in the ongoing evolution and development of this entire vast cosmos (thus continuing a central theme of the monotheistic religious traditions) will have to be conceived as much greater in scale and in mystery than anything suggested by the stories and images that informed and constituted most traditional thinking. The kind of personal intimacy with God fostered by many of these images especially such anthropomorphic ones as "father," "lord," and "king" no longer seems appropriate, or even imaginable or intelligible. So our human "relationships" with God will have to be conceived in much vaguer and less vivid terms than in the piety of the past the characterization of God as serendipitous creativity straightforwardly suggests this and our understanding of human</page><page sequence="10">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 43 Questions are not criticisms, but sincere, positive, and constructive responses to Kaufman's theological imagination and construction. The divine mystery of serendipitous creativity with its complex trajectories invites extended reflection. Surely, then, the model succeeds under the criterion of fruitfulness by provoking and pressing theological imagination beyond the stale personal models of God. The energy of Kaufman's construction draws us into his theological imagination, which moves us to leave behind divine agency and immerse ourselves in the divine mystery of serendipitous creativity. existence as "under God" will be experienced as much more open, much looser, and much less determinate and specific.</page></plain_text>
