<plain_text><page sequence="1">Comment and Response A Comment on Inquiry and Composing George Hillocks' article on theory and research concerning the relationship of inquiry and composing (CE, November 1982) is useful in a way that research in the curious field of composition and rhetoric rarely is: Professor Hillocks actually discusses the difference such an inquiry might make in the way we teach writing. There are, however, several problematic passages that I would like to comment on. First, Hillocks notes that most ex- periments with heuristics (so-called) fail "to control for teacher bias" (p. 660). What does that mean? Is it sim- ply a way of saying that we should be given evidence that the teacher had in fact put some time and intellectual energy into understanding the "sys- tematic procedure for discovering the propositions"? (In which case, the teacher might have concluded that propositions are not "discovered" but must be formulated.) Or does it mean that the effect of attitude towards the experiment has not been taken into ac- count? But how do we identify and evaluate attitude? "Controlling for teacher bias": does that way of putting it mask the all-important point that no theory is better than the pedagogy it requires? Second, Professor Hillocks illus- trates the "scientific" use of inquiry procedures by the work of animal be- haviorists, especially the ethologist Karl von Frisch. It should be noted that the failure on the part of these sci- entists to examine the logic of their underlying assumptions has brought into question their findings. (The fun- damental notion of the "social be- havior" of animals is itself highly am- biguous.) Susanne K. Langer in a long chapter entitled "Interpretations" in the second volume of Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling, (Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1972) subjects this kind of inquiry to rigorous logical analysis, showing how Tin- bergen, Lorenz, the Gardners, Jane Goodall, et al. fail to develop compet- ing explanations or even to recognize the need to do so. Mind also includes references to and redactions of many papers calling into question the claims College English, Volume 45, Number 6, October 1983 605</page><page sequence="2">606 College English of the ethologists and criticizing their experimental designs. A sounder explanation of the nature of scientific inquiry can be found in J. Robert Oppenheimer's well-known 1955 address to the American Psychological Association, "Analogy in Science." He shows how the princi- ple of complementarity works and how scientists depend on analogy--or what C. S. Peirce calls "abduction"-in de- veloping new insights. This is rather a different matter from anthropomorphic projection. In any case, inquiry into inquiry cannot really affect pedagogy until we come to realize the irrele- vance of the methodology of social scientists who along with ethologists, sociobiologists, and the like bow down before what Langer calls the Idols of the Laboratory. Finally, Hillocks observes in conclu- sion that his studies involving actually teaching students certain inquiry proce- dures "indicate a hitherto ignored con- nection between composing and in- quiry" and, further, that they "indicate new directions for theory, research, and practice in the teaching of composition" (p. 672). Hitherto ignored? Not by Walker Gibson, Richard Coe, Jac- queline Berke, Don Murray, Charles Kay Smith, Ann Raimes, et al. Inquiry is not "connected" to composing; it is a dimension of composing, as my own textbook seeks to demonstrate. George Hillocks, whose Observing and Writing I much admire, could join those who have a long time since been exploring the heuristic power of inquiry proce- dures in saying to the composition re- searcher, "'Tis new to thee."
