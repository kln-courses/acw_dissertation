<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIBLICAL ILLUSTRATION IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY ENGLISH ART By T. S. R. Boase Round the year i8oo the Bible as a subject of historical painting in the grand manner was, largely thanks to Macklin's Bible,1 enjoying some- thing of a revival. Altarpieces had been coming back into fashion, particularly at the two ancient universities, and All Souls had even gone as far in i769 as to commission 'a picture representing the appearance of our Saviour to Mary in the Garden after his resurrection from the hand of Mengs, a celebrated painter now in Madrid.'2 In England, the chief representative of the Mengs school was Benjamin West, P.R.A., with two years' gap, from 1792-1820. West had been turned towards biblical painting by the commission in 1780 from George III to paint thirty-five subjects from the Old and New Testa- ments to illustrate Revealed Religion for the Chapel of Windsor Castle. Work on these was largely completed by 1805, but the Prince Regent did not care for the scheme, the paintings were eventually returned to West and were dispersed in the sale at his death. Several of them were bought by Joseph Neeld and have since then been hanging in Grittleton House until their sale at Christies in the autumn of 1962.* These very large and grandiloquent works show ingenious regrouping of classical and Renaissance motifs and a firm orderliness of planning, but the expressions are stereotyped and banal, and the handling of the paint is flat and unconvincing. The opportunity of seeing them at Christies has done little to enhance West's reputation. His finest biblical paintings came later, Christ Rejected in I814 and Death on the Pale Horse, the final version of which is from i 817. The Christ Rejected shows his faults and virtues, his able organization of a crowded scene, and his highly mechanical contrasts in expressions. Several of the leading painters of the time were similarly employed on religious subjects. The Annunciation by Matthew William Peters was presented to Lincoln Cathedral in 1799 and still hangs there. Richard Westall's Christ crowned with Thorns was given by George IV to Nash's new church of All Saints, Langham Place, and retains its place above the main altar. Westall was, however, primarily a book illustrator, and in I813 and again just before his death in 1836 produced series of Bible illustrations. Blake's biblical paint- ings, whatever echoes they have of Fuseli's style, are so individually imagined as to be outside any trends of the time. Haydon's The Entry into Jerusalem (St. Mary's Seminary, Norwood, Ohio) and The Raising of Lazarus (Tate Gallery) have the emotional emptiness of West, only emphasized by their violent chiaroscuro. Etty in 1829-31 produced his extraordinary trio of paintings on the subject ofJudith. They are immense in size, the central canvas 120 X 157 inches, and two side canvases i 181 x 1o8 inches. They represent Judith's 1 T. S. T. Boase, 'Macklin and Bowyer', this Journal, XXVI, 1963, pp. i64-9. 2J.

BOASE maid waiting outside the tent of Holofernes; Judith slaying Holofernes; and Judith going forth, giving the head to her maid. They are vast machines in the romantic manner, a very unusual incident in English art. A small sketch for the centrepiece was sold as a Gdricault in 1952. At the same period, on another huge canvas (120 x 157 inches) he painted Benaiah slaying two lion-like men of Moab, an eccentric if not unique subject and one to which no theological implications have ever been attached.4 Here it serves for a vast display of sadistic violence, which was one side of the sensuous nature that the worthy Etty so ingenuously and constantly revealed. These colossal figure studies had however growing competition from another form of illustration. There was a long tradition of biblical or sacred episodes set in paintings that were primarily landscape, minute groups of figures that would be unidentifiable without the title. Claude's David at the Cave of Adullam or Gaspar Poussin's Storm, with Biblical Figures are examples, both of which, now in the National Gallery, were in England in the early I8OOs, and were exhibited at the British Institution in 1816. Each has at different times been variously entitled; the Claude has been known as Sinon before Priam and Alexander the Great Speaking to his Soldiers; for the Gaspar Poussin, The Calling of Abraham, Elijah and the Angel, Moses and St. Matthew have all been suggested. Another puzzle was provided by Sir George Beaumont's Claude (National Gallery) which was long known as The Annun- ciation but is now re-named Hagar and the Angel. In the Angerstein Collection were Claude's Marriage of Isaac and Rebecca and Gaspar's Abraham and Isaac approaching the Place of Sacrifice. The genre was therefore familiar enough and it would have been surprising if Turner had not attempted it. His Fifth Plague (Indianapolis) which, emulating the obscurity of Claude and Gaspar's subjects, should in fact be the seventh, was exhibited in i800, the Tenth Plague in 1802. In between his The Army of the Medes destroyed in the desart (sic) by a whirlwind-foretold by Jeremiah, Chap. XV, ver. 32, 33, now lost but for which some sketches have recently been identified,5 seems to have achieved 'a shadowey sublimity',6 which suggests that he was finding his own par- ticular approach to such themes. He continued throughout his life to use biblical subjects: Rizpah (I8OO); The Holy Family (1803); The Deluge (c. 1805) The Destruction of Sodom (c. I 8o5); Pilate Washing his Hands (1830); The Fiery Furnace (1832); Christ driving the Traders from the Temple (c. I840); The Dawn of Christianity, Flight into Egypt (Belfast, 1841); The Angel standing in the Sun (Rev. XIX, i7, i8) (1846): but his main contribution to biblical illustration was, as will be seen, topographical rather than narrative. It was left to John Martin to evolve the most popular brand of scriptural landscape. His Joshua (now in the Freemasons' Hall, Aldwych) was exhibited at the Academy in 1816 and contains all the repertory of rocky hills, huge architecture, lowering clouds, and sense of scale emphasized by minute figures which were to fascinate &lt; The Judiths and the Benaiah are in the National Gallery of Scotland, but one, Judith's Maid outside the Tent, is on long loan to York: for further details see Dennis Farr, William Etty, 1958, pp. 50-51 and 135-6. 5J.

More impressive on the whole in engravings than in oil, they exerted a compelling stimulus on biblical visual imagination in the first half of the nineteenth century. They had however a new type of rival. From the days of early pilgrimage onwards there had been much interest in the actual appearance of the holy places. The Sepulchre and its church had been frequently drawn. In the late fifteenth century the 'skilled painter', Erhard Reuwich of Utrecht, had made sketches to illustrate Bernhard von Breydenbach's travels in 1483-84 in the Holy Land, and these had been engraved and often re-used. They were replaced by Giovanni Zuallardo's drawings for his Il Devotissimo Viaggio di Gierusalemme, published at Rome in 1585 and followed in 1609 by Bernardino Amico's Trattato delle Piante e Immagini de Sacri Edifizi di Terra Santa, an in- valuable book architecturally, but with little attempt at representation of the countryside. Zuallardo's small landscapes such as The Desert of John the Baptist and The Mountains of Judaea echo the spiral, twisted hills which from Byzantium had passed to Europe to become the stock-in-trade of medieval illuminators. They too were frequently re-used by other authors, notably by George Sandys in his Relation of a Journey begun An. Dom. i6io (London, i6i5). Palestine was visited in I68I by Corneille le Bruyn who not only per- ceived in himself 'an insuperable Propension of Travelling into Foreign Parts', but also fortunately decided that 'there was nothing more requisite and advantageous for a Traveller, who would reap any Benefit from his Travels, than to be skilled in the Art of Designing, that thereby he might imprint Things more deeply into his Mind, and represent them before his Eyes as always present, which is the surest way of keeping him from forgetting what he has observed.'8 He therefore applied himself for a time to painting before setting out on his journey. His large folding panoramas of towns, set in wide views of hills and bays, are considerable achievements, all the more so as drawings always had to be made 'with all the Privacy imaginable . . . The Turks being always Suspicious, that when the Christians take the Draught of any of their Towns, it is upon no design but to do them a Prejudice', a handi- cap under which travellers were long to labour. Le Bruyn was shortly followed by Henry Maundrell's A Journey from Aleppo to Jerusalem, published in 1703, and by 1732 reaching its fifth edition. Maundrell was a fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, who became chaplain to the Levant Company's factory at Aleppo, and his very readable book was long to be a guide to travellers in Syria; but it has few plates, as the publisher decided 'le Brune being in every ones hands' only 'to furnish it with such cuts' as neither Le Bruyn nor Sandys had provided. When in 1824 the first volume of The Modern Traveller appeared, devoted to Palestine, Maundrell is described as 'perhaps the most correct, and one of the most intelligent of all travellers'.Y For a possible influence of earlier works on Martin, see T.

BOASE Le Bruyn was to have no serious rival till in i784 Louis Frangois Cassas, an experienced artist, visited Syria and Palestine with Count Choiseul- Gouffier, the French ambassador to the Sublime Porte. Cassas's engravings, splendid pieces that seem to owe something to the examples of Piranesi, appeared in his Voyage pittoresque de la Syrie in 1799. He tells us little of his travels, but he had presumably diplomatic privileges that eased the way. The English ambassador at the Porte, Sir Robert Ainslie, was equally active. At Constantinople from 1775 to 1792 he was said to be a boon companion of the Sultan, Ahmed IV, and a successful negotiator on behalf of the Levant Company. He was also something of an antiquarian, and no doubt the Sultan's friendship facilitated travel. He toured widely, taking with him an artist, Luigi Mayer, whose drawings in the possession of Sir Robert Ainslie were eventually published in three volumes in i8oi, 1803 and I804, the last dealing with Palestine. Less striking and less accurate than Cassas's engrav- ings, they had the advantage of being coloured aquatints. The outbreak of war with France in 1793 produced a complicating factor in foreign travel, and in 1798 the French expedition to Egypt and its eventual defeat with the capture of Alexandria in 18oi immensely changed the whole position in the Near East. We have a full account of the problems and excitements of journeys in this period in the Travels in Various Countries of Europe, Asia and Africa written by Edward Clarke.1? Dr. Clarke was a fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, later Professor of Mineralogy, and a man of the most intrepid energy and curiosity. In 1799 he set out with a young pupil, who financed the tour, on a journey that began with Scandinavia, as the only part of Europe open to the English. They went up to the extreme north of Scandinavia, then, crossing the Baltic in bad mid-winter storms, to St. Petersburg, at that time experiencing the full eccentricities of the lunatic Emperor, Paul. From there they went to Moscow, and travelled down the Don to the sea of Azov and the Crimea, arriving, after another very stormy voyage, at Constantinople in November 18oo. Clarke now aimed at joining his brother, who was with the English fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean. At Rhodes, in April 180 i, he found many wounded English troops from Acre, where Sir Sidney Smith had been engaging the French, and learned that the English were now established at Aboukir and that Alexandria was blockaded. He succeeded in joining his brother there and he and his pupil took a house in Rosetta. From there expeditions were made to Cairo, Cyprus and Jerusalem. 'These are favourable times' Clarke wrote in a letter, 'for travellers in the Levant, when frigates are daily sailing in all directions, and the English name is so much respected.'11 From Alexandria, after its capture, he went to Athens and then in the lull of the Peace of Amiens made his way across Europe back to England. In Constantinople, and again in Athens, Clarke had seen something of the Neapolitan artist, Lusieri, who was working for Lord Elgin. On the whole Clarke disapproved of Lord Elgin's activities, partially because he thought he was pillaging the Parthenon to decorate 'some Scottish villa': but he himself 10 Published i812.

He played a prominent and no doubt forceful part in securing the Rosetta Stone, the sarcophagus made for Nectanebo II (which Clarke was convinced had been used for Alexander), and the rest of the antiquities that the French had collected in Alexandria; and from Athens he succeeded in having shipped to England for the University of Cambridge a large bust of Ceres (in fact the head of a caryatid from the inner propylaea at Eleusis), defeating Lord Elgin in obtaining it. He was also a talented amateur sketcher, and his very accurate drawings of the coastline from Acre to Jeru- salem, and of the Sea of Galilee and the landscape round Nazareth and Bethlehem, etched for his travels by the much employed Letitia Byrne,12 are a new departure, where the buildings matter little and the scenery is the subject. It was not, however, the illustrations that roused most biblical interest, but Clarke's denunciation of the authenticity of the Holy Sepulchre. This opened a vigorous period of controversy, which gave an added induce- ment to Palestinian investigations. Clarke is an example of the traveller whom no difficulties could daunt. Others availed themselves of opportunities that came their way. F. B. Spilsbury was surgeon on H.M.S. Le Tigre and published in 1803 Picturesque Scenery of the Holy Land and Syria delineated during the campaigns of 1799 and I8oo; the plates were aquatints, coloured stipple engravings and coloured soft ground etchings, drawn by Edward Orme from Spilsbury's sketches 'on the spot'. These pleasant views are mainly of the coast as seen from on board ship. The work is dedicated to Sir Sidney Smith, whom Spilsbury greatly admired. The book enjoyed sufficient popularity to be reissued in 1823.13 Captain Henry Light undertook a tour of Egypt and Palestine in a period of leave from Malta and published in 1818 his Travels in Egypt, Nubia, Holy Land, Mount Lebanon and Cyprus in the Year 1814. Of his drawings the most notable was the view of Jerusalem from the terrace of the convent of the Latin monks, the name generally given by the English to the Franciscan monastery where all European visitors were accommodated. Light stresses how high the reputa- tion of the English stood at this time, and the comparative ease this gave to travelling in these parts; advantage of it was taken by various other travellers such as the Hon. Charles Irby and James Mangles, whose Travels in Egypt, and Nubia, Syria and Asia Minor during the years 18I7 and I8i8 was printed for private distribution in 1823, and who, travelling in Arab dress, successfully reached both Palmyra and Petra. Native costume had hitherto been essential in all Arab countries. Now there was some relaxation: 'the address and gallantry of Sir Sidney Smith at Acre', wrote a visitor in 1817, 'have procured for the English a degree of consideration not extended to the individuals of any other Christian community. I have frequently thrown off my Arabian cloak, and walked through different parts of the city in a light Smyrna hat and common hunting frock, without experiencing the slightest inconvenience.'14 12 William Byrne (1743-1805) was an engraver of landscapes, whose work was carried on by his children, Letitia, Elizabeth and John, all of whom provided illustrations for books of travel and archaeology. Letitia etched many views of Oxford. 13 For these illustrated travel books see J. R. Abbey, Travel in Aquatint and Litho- graphy from the Library of J. R. Abbey, ii, 1957, pp. 307-15- '* T. R. Jolliffe, Letters from Palestine, 1819, p. 107.</page><page sequence="10">354 T. S. R. BOASE Very different from these military and naval excursions were the travels in 1816 ofJ. S. Buckingham, an adventurous character who, as a boy of ten on an English ship, had been captured and imprisoned at Lisbon; plundered and stripped in Nubia; shipwrecked offJedda in an attempt to reach Mecca, and had had similar adventures in India. 'Through the greater part of the country I passed as a native of it, wearing the dress and speaking the language of the Arabs, and by these means commanding a free intercourse with the people in their most unguarded moments and opening sources of information which would otherwise have been inaccessible.'15 Buckingham was a judicious observer, and, self taught as he was, could write with some distinction. Of the Palestinian travellers of the period he ranks with Clarke, with whom he strongly disagrees; but the small vignettes in his book are of no great impor- tance as illustrative material. Yet another type of traveller was Charles Barry, then only twenty-four and as yet unknown, who was taken by Mr. David Baillie in 1819 on a tour of Egypt, Palestine and Syria, at a salary of7?2oo a year, in return for the sketches made by him. They failed in an attempt to reach Palmyra, and it was only Barry's Arab burnous that diverted a spear thrust when they were attacked on the way.16 Barry's drawings were not published by him, but were to be the basis of work by other artists. The comparatively enlightened rigime (1804-19) of Suleiman Pasha at Acre, who for most of his rule controlled also the Pashalik of Damascus, was a factor in the increased facilities. Under his successor, Abdullah, affairs rapidly deteriorated. The outbreak in 1821 of the Greek War of Independence distracted the Turks from their never firmly controlled empire, and revived suspicion and hatred of the Christians. It was during this period that John Madox, who arrived in Syria in 1824, carried out 'many delightful wanderings amid the varied scenery of the East, during a protracted absence of some years from his native land.'1 He travelled always in native dress, and was in fre- quent danger from roving Arab bands. His drawings were lithographed by R. J. Hamilton and printed by C. Hullmandel. Sir Frederick Henniker travelled successfully from Egypt via Sinai but was severely wounded in an expedition to the Dead Sea.1s Despite such difficulties, the first English guide- book to Palestine appeared in 1824, The Modern Traveller, already mentioned. This remarkable and careful compilation contains extracts from previous travellers, much historical information and practical advice about routes, pro- cedure and dress. The last it is assumed will be Turkish, and is described in detail,19 particularly stressing what colours it was permissible for a Christian to wear. These travellers and the drawings they brought back with them opened up new possibilities of biblical illustration, well suited to the growing demand for accuracy in historical studies. When John Murray published in 1834 his Illustrations of the Bible, the prospectus stressed it was 'A series of matter of fact 15 Travels in Palestine, 182 I, p. xix. 16 A.

These views were based on sketches taken on the spot by various travellers, amongst them Charles Barry, C. R. Cockerell, Henry Gally Knight, Capt. W. FitzMaurice, James Morier and Robert Ker Porter, and were to be redrawn by J. M. W. Turner, A. W. Callcott, C. Stanfield and other eminent artists. Turner's Sunrise over Nazareth or Storm over Sidon (P1. 63a) (both from sketches by Charles Barry) hardly, perhaps, achieve the aim of combining the utmost excellence of art with the most exact and faithful adherence to the original sketches, but this does not alter the aim of the publication, and many of the other artists achieve a much closer realism. J. D. Harding's rendering of a sketch by Captain FitzMaurice of Mount Tabor is more topographically correct, but is stylistically far removed from the etchings illustrating FitzMaurice's Cruise, where this particular subject is not represented. The plates are steel engrav- ings, the new process that was by then enjoying much popularity and con- siderably reducing cost. Murray's Biblical Illustrations was followed in 1836 by John Carne's Views of Syria, The Holy Land etc. illustrated in a series of views drawn from nature by W. H. Bartlett. William Bartlett, born in 1809, had been a pupil of John Britton and had worked for him on his Picturesque Antiquities of English Cities. In 1834-35 he made his first visit to the Near East. There the situation had again changed. Mohammed Ali had sent a force under his son Ibrahim to assist the Turks in the Greek War. When the European powers, outraged by Ibrahim's massacres in Greece, intervened to prevent further campaigns, Mohammed Ali claimed Syria from the Sultan as compensation for his son, and, when this was refused, Ibrahim in 1831 laid siege to Acre and eventually gained control of Palestine and Syria, where he established the westernizing policies of his father. The thirties were therefore a period when travel was on the whole encouraged. Bartlett in 1834 was not able to visit Jerusalem, where Ibrahim was dealing with a revolt, but Oman Effendi, Ibrahim's close colleague who had been at Cambridge, offered to take the travellers with him from Jaffa. Bartlett and his friends, however, thought it wiser to proceed by boat to Acre.2? Captain FitzMaurice in the previous year recounts how some dubious characters 'vanished from the place' at the mysterious name of Ibrahim Pasha.21 Leon de Laborde whose Voyage de la Syrie appeared in 1837, with a series of engravings that at once enjoyed much popularity, wrote 'De nos jours une exploration de ce genre est une promenade; en 1827 [the year of his journey] c'6tait une voyage aventureux. . . Mohammed Aly n'avait pas fait plier la morgue turque et disciplin6 la violence Arabe.'22 Despite the ease of 'la promenade', Bartlett, as we have seen, failed to reach Jerusalem. He, however, made two later visits to the Holy City, publishing the results in Walks about Jerusalem (1844) and Jerusalem Revisited, which appeared post- humously aftei his death in 1854 at sea off Malta. As was to be expected of a pupil of Britton his architectural drawings form an important record of the condition of the buildings that he studied. He had the contemporary liking 20 W.

BOASE for defiles, rocks and ruins, but his View ofSidon (P1. 63b) as compared to that by Turner shows his sober, sensible approach to the scene depicted. The publishers sound a new note in their preface to Views of Syria: 'It is impossible to estimate too highly the great advantages which this country is about to derive from the Manufacturing, Commercial and Trading resources, scientific discovering and rapid intercourse of the East: the march of the intel- lect and the flight of steam are advancing hand and hand into the heart of Asia-even while this volume has been in progress, new facilities have been opened in various directions.' John Carne, the editor of the volume, had travelled in the Near East during all the horrors of the Greek War of Inde- pendence, hearing the details of the massacre at Scio from the survivors, staying with Archbishop Cyprian in Nicosia very shortly before his execution by the Turks.23 He now almost regretfully wrote that 'The good times of wild adventure, of delicious heroism, and suffering for the sake of the Cross, are gone for ever. . . . The increasing facilities of conveyance already bring Palestine comparatively near to our own homes.' In 1825 the Levant Com- pany had finally lost its monopoly, and free trade with the Near East was established. A new venture was launched by Charles Knight and Co. in 1836 and completed in 1838, aiming at a popular market and meeting all tastes, The Pictorial Bible illustrated with many hundred woodcuts representing the Historical events after celebrated pictures, the Landscape scenes, from original drawings, or from authentic engravings, and the subjects of Natural History, Costume and Antiquities from the best sources, to which are added original notes, chiefly explanatory of the engravings, and of such passages connected with the History, Geography, Natural History and Antiquities of the Sacred Scriptures as require observation. Published in three volumes, the first has a frontispiece in the conventional seventeenth-century style, but vol. ii has a late Gothic doorway as a frame for the title and vol. iii is completely in accord with the Gothic revival. Each of the books begins with an ornamental initial in a vaguely medieval manner. The engravings, generally in vignette shape with the edges shaded off without margin, are of poor quality and take immense liberties with their originals both as to details and subject, liberties which are nowhere acknowledged in the text. Thus Andrea del Sarto's Baptist before Herod from the Chiostro dello Scalzo becomes David and the Amalekite; Abigail travelling to meet David is a group out of a land- scape by Berghem; Mordecai and Esther is 'adapted from an antique Roman sculpture engraved in the Musde Frangais'; Poussin's Et ego in Arcadia serves for Caleb's Daughters at the Spring (Joshua XV, 19); Psalm xi, I, 'I waited patiently for the Lord' is illustrated by Chantrey's memorial to Lady Char- lotte Digby in Worcester Cathedral; Psalm ix, Io, 'Thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek Thee' by two figures from Canova's monument for Maria Christina in the Augustinerkirche in Vienna; Job xxxix, i9, 'Hast thou given the horse strength' by a detail from the Elgin marbles. Reynolds's New College window is freely employed for a variety of purposes. It is a relief to find the Raphael loggia ceiling and cartoons being used for their right topics. The Book of Revelation has a simplified version of Benjamin West's Death on the 23John Carne, Letters from the East, 2 vols., I826: dedicated to Sir Walter Scott.</page><page sequence="13">BIBLICAL ILLUSTRATION 357 Pale Horse. Northcote's Balaam and the Ass is one of the few pieces taken from Macklin's Bible. The landscapes are largely from Laborde, Cassas, Niebuhr's Beschreibung von Arabien (1772) and Charles Macfarlane's Seven Apocalyptic Churches (1832). Ezra viii, 31, 'The hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way' uses for instance a group of Arab bandits from Laborde. This extraordinary and ridiculous publication sums up almost in caricature form all the trends of the previous fifty years in biblical illustration. Of the artists who benefited from Ibrahim's rule, David Roberts was the most notable.24 Born at Stockbridge near Edinburgh in 1796, the son of a village shoemaker, he was apprenticed to a house painter in Edinburgh and about 1820 became a scene painter in the theatres of Edinburgh and Glasgow. In 1824 he first travelled abroad to France, and in 1826 a view of Rouen Cathedral was his first exhibit in the Academy. In 1837 appeared a volume of lithographs, Picturesque Sketches in Spain. In 1838-39 he was travelling in Egypt and Palestine, making the cross-country journey from Cairo to Akaba and up to Petra, where he was the first European to be allowed to camp there, and on to Jerusalem. A firman from Mahommed Ali eased his progress and even obtained for him permission to sketch in some of the mosques. In 1842 he began to publish lithographs of these travels. They appeared in various formats: he was patronized by royalty, became an R.A., made a considerable fortune and eventually was one of the Commissioners for the 1851 Exhibition. The collected two-volume edition of his lithographs of Egypt and the Holy Land (I855) is dedicated to the Queen, 'As the Defender of the Faith of a great Christian Empire'. Roberts was an accurate recorder. Travelling in Arab dress, he understood the life of the country and his figure groups are a notable advance on those of other artists (P1. 63c). Primarily he was interested in architecture, practically none of which of course is biblical, but his landscapes have a genuine feel of the place, despite the romanticism which no one of that time, faced with those wild mountains and famous ruins, could well escape. His lithographs are a lasting monument to Palestine and Syria in the mid- nineteenth century, the visual equivalent of the Higher Criticism which contemporaneously was establishing itself at Tuibingen. Roberts' eastern journey, carefully and sensibly planned, had been much encouraged and aided by Sir David Wilkie. In 1840 he himself left for the Holy Land: 'now that Syria is open,' he wrote, 'and that steam-boat naviga- tion is spreading in all directions, may not a system of scripture painting be required corresponding, not to our ignorance, but to our improving know- ledge of Syria.'25 From Jerusalem he wrote to William Collins that 'a Martin Luther in painting is as much called for as in theology, to sweep away the abuses by which our divine pursuit is encumbered:' and in a long letter to Sir Robert Peel, he discussed the handicap under which the greatest artists had laboured through never having visited the Holy Land. He recalled, writing to Thomas Phillips, how he had often jokingly told Turner 'that he ought to have mounted the staff and scallop shell for such a peregrination'. 'Roberts's', 24 J.

BOASE he wrote in the same letter, 'most interesting pictures though distinct from scripture art, may yet, with his great ability, lead to the call for scripture pictures, and may lead to others visiting the holy territory.' Syria in fact proved less 'open' than Wilkie had anticipated. His arrival at Constantinople in October 1840 coincided with the English fleet's bombardment of Acre in order to dislodge Ibrahim Pasha and restore Turkish rule. It was not till February 1841 that he was able to land at Jaffa and proceed to Jerusalem. His travels to the Dead Sea and Bethlehem were well escorted and uneventful, but the journey planned overland to Beyrout had to be abandoned owing to the prevalence of plague, and he sailed from Jaffa to Alexandria. Wilkie did not live to make use of his expedition, and its results survive only as un- finished sketches. He died on I June 1841 off Malta, on his return journey. His epitaph is the great pall of smoke from the 'Oriental Steam Ship' that drifts across Turner's painting. Wilkie's aims were not to be left without successors. But meanwhile a new and very different impulse was affecting religious art. Wilkie on his overland route to Constantinople had stopped at Munich and seen much of the new school of painting there, which had originated in the Nazarene group at Rome, and in England was generally known as the Early Christian School. Wilkie admired their skill, but doubted whether this revival of a past style would suit the disposition of the English public, 'to whom it would be like bringing forward the Talmud and the Fathers of the Church, instead of the Pentateuch and the New Testament'. Others in England took a more favour- able view. To Pugin, Overbeck was 'that prince of Christian painters' whose school was 'fast putting to shame the natural and sensual school of art in which the modern followers of Paganism have so long degraded the representations of sacred personages and events.'26 Ford Madox Brown was in Rome in the winter of 1844-45 and met Overbeck and Cornelius what impressed him with the latter was his 'emphaticality', and something of their decision of statement passed into his own work.27 His Christ washing Peter's Feet (185I: Tate Gallery) is perhaps his most important biblical painting, and his own account of it stresses his aim at 'general truth', by which he meant historical accuracy, but also that the 'documentary and historic should be subordinate to the supernatural and Christianic'. A closer follower of Nazarene influence was William Dyce. Born at Aberdeen in i806, he had studied in Rome where he became a friend of Overbeck. In 1844 he exhibited at the Academy Joash shooting the Arrow of Deliverance (Kunsthalle, Hamburg), a grand, simplified design whose boldness and clarity of outline broke with the academic chiaroscuro of English art. The following year Dyce painted for the Prince Consort a Virgin and Child (I845 earlier version, I838, in Nottingham Art Gallery), which is almost a definitive statement of the quattrocento cult. Such a subject however was too theologically central for Dyce's usual practice. Perhaps his Aberdonian birth always held him back. Joash is a rarely depicted Old Testament incident (though Westall had illustrated it earlier in the century), and a theme that much occupied him, St. John leading the Blessed Virgin Mary from the Tomb, was an invention of his own, deducible from 26 A.

He began to work on his main ver- sion of this in 1841, revised it in 1851 and took it up again in I86o. At some period he painted a smaller, quite different rendering (Coll. Charles Handley- Read, Esq.) where surprisingly there are in the poses hints of Botticelli's Deposition, an early instance of the reviving interest in that painter. Similar iconographic trends are evident in the painting exhibited in the Academy in 1847 by J. R. Herbert, Our Saviour, subject to his parents at Nazareth (Guildhall Art Gallery). Here also is a more or less invented incident, with in addition the symbolism of Christ's glance falling on the Cross formed amongst the wood chippings from Joseph's bench. A note in the Academy catalogue, however, links it with other lines of thought. 'The background' it states 'is painted from a very careful drawing made at Nazareth.' Herbert himself had not been in Palestine, so he must have worked from someone else's sketch. Considering the very generalized nature of the landscape this seems hardly necessary, but the note is indicative of the new demand for accuracy and there is a much more developed sense of actual scenery in his Moses bringing the Tables of the Law28 (Pl. 63d) in the Peers Robing Room in the Houses of Parliament. Herbert was a Catholic convert and friend of Pugin. The Pre-Raphaelites, though any biblical representation opened the way to charges of Puseyism, were a more Protestant body. Direct study from nature, invention of incident and symbolism while combining it with realism in pose and gesture, were to be the characteristics of their handling of the Bible. What are hints in Herbert become an elaborate programme in Millais' Carpenter's Shop (Tate Gallery) of 1850. Local colour is almost negligible: the background is blocked out by symbolic sheep, and the clothes, save for the patterned loin-cloth of the unknown apprentice, are very near the mid- nineteenth century, particularly the cut of the Virgin's skirt. The pierced hand and the Baptist with his bowl of water are on the contrary richly significant. It was a use of symbolism that reached its climax in Holman Hunt's Light of the World (Keble College, Oxford), exhibited after Hunt had left for Palestine. Ruskin wrote a famous exposition of all the details: the barred door, the clinging ivy, the hovering bat, the fallen apples, the leaves sprouting from the crown of thorns. In engravings, on banners, in stained glass it has become one of the best known images of Protestant art, didactic rather than emotional, for the aisle rather than the altar. When the replica painted for St. Paul's was sent on a tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1906, sixty-eight thousand people visited the gallery in Sydney where it was exhibited. In 1854 Hunt left for his first journey to Palestine, with the aim of making 'more tangible Jesus Christ's History and Teaching' by painting the actual scenery and studying dress and customs as they survived in Jerusalem. His account of his adventures is given in his Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood,29 and it is clear that he began with singularly little idea of the manners and prejudices of the East. In Cairo his search for female models led him into a brothel from which he escaped with 'a fight with a man or two in 2 There is a replica (II ft. 2 ins.

BOASE going downstairs, and an encounter with several dogs in the yard'. In Jeru- salem he was soon in difficulties over sketching from a roof top that over- looked the privacy of Arab houses, but in a scuffle in the streets his 'elementary knowledge of self defence' gained him some prestige. The outbreak of the Crimean War resulted in the withdrawal of many Turkish troops from Cairo, with a consequent resurgence of local banditry and Hunt ran real risks in his journey to the Dead Sea to paint The Scapegoat.3? He had, however, gained considerable fluency in Arabic with remarkable speed, and this with his obvious fearlessness and disregard for convention clearly impressed the Arab bands with which he came in contact. Probably they regarded him as magnun, a man possessed and under divine protection. The painting which Hunt from the beginning of his travels had in mind was The Finding of Christ in the Temple (Birmingham) (P1. 63e). His search for models, his researches into ancient Hebrew customs were all directed to this main end; but the picture was not completed till 1i860, four years after his return. This delay was mainly due to Hunt's lack of funds on his return, and the consequent need to carry out replicas of earlier works and to undertake commissions such as that for the Moxon Tennyson. It is hardly surprising that the finished work seems over-laboured. In the end there were too many models and all were crowded in. Immensely careful and learned, it lacks any immediate visual impact. Nothing could better illustrate the dangers of pedantic analysis of detail. But it was a great success. Purchased by the art dealer Gambart for ?5,5oo and exhibited in his gallery, it drew large and appreciative crowds and a command that it should be sent to Windsor for royal inspection. Here at last was the truth about scriptural scenes, and it was the new accuracy that mattered rather than the artistic achievement. The other major work that came from his journey was The Scapegoat (Lady Lever Art Gallery). This had largely been completed on the site, and was shown in the Academy of 1856, where it at once roused considerable contro- versy. Hunt was not the first to paint in oils on the shores of the Dead Sea. The French landscape painter, Antoine Alphonse Montfort, had already done so in the 182Os, under conditions much less dangerous than those surrounding Hunt.31 It is unlikely, however, that Hunt knew his rendering of it. The dying beast in this vividly coloured but threateningly empty landscape has become a familiar symbol. The horizontal design, unbroken by any verticals, serves to emphasize the lonely isolation. Hunt in a smaller version now at Manchester had closed in the picture more conventionally by adding a rainbow on the top right-hand corner and emphasizing the gazelle's skull on the bottom left-hand, but these he omitted or toned down to secure the bleak- ness of the finished version. The profitable and successful exhibition of The Finding in the Temple encouraged similar ventures. In 1867 two Bond Street dealers, J. L. Fairless and G. L. Beeforth, signed a contract with the French painter Gustave Dord for a group of paintings, The Fall of Paganism, Christ healing the Sick, The Sermon on the Mount, Christ leaving the Praetorium, St. Paul led to Martyrdom, or 30 An account of the position in Palestine can be found in J. Finn, Stirring Times, or Records from Jerusalem Consular Chronicles of 1853 to 1856, 2 vols., 1878. 3x L. de Laborde, 'Un artiste dans le desert', Revue franfaise, March 1839, pp. 3-32.</page><page sequence="17">BIBLICAL ILLUSTRATION 361 any other subject of the like character.32 The first of these, the only one com- pleted at the time, and 'a miscellaneous gathering of pictures and drawings' were exhibited in i868 from April to September at I68 New Bond Street. In the following year, the exhibition was moved to larger premises at 35 New Bond Street (now Sotheby's) where it remained open continuously except on Sundays, Good Friday and Christmas. Skilfully stage managed with hidden footlights, it became one of the obligatory sights of London, and the paintings through engravings of them became familiar throughout the Christian world. Christ leaving the Praetorium, completed in 1872, was hailed as 'the most marvel- lous picture of the present age', and must for many years have been one of the best known pictures in the world. Today its over-dramatic emphasis, the spot-lighting of Christ and the centralization of the theme seem mechanical, and any communication of sincerity is lost in the trite and obvious scheme of presentation, but its own fame has contributed to the exhaustion of the methods it represents. The gallery lingered on in Bond Street till 1914, a year in which it shared some of the space with an exhibition of Italian futurists. Then with the outbreak of war 'the canvases which had been seen by so many thousands of English people, which had comforted the prejudices of a whole era, were taken from their stretcher, rolled up and shipped to America. It is believed in Bond Street that they went down during the crossing; whether that be true or not, they have completely disappeared.'33 Whether submerged or not, they reappeared, considerably the worse for wear, un- stretched and unframed at Christies on 31 July 1964.34 Damaged and dirty, out of all keeping with modern taste, their uncompromising dramatic state- ments still can have some effect. Dord's visit to England in 1868 was not only concerned with the Bond Street Gallery. In 1866 Alfred Maine et Fils of Tours had published a lavish edition of the Vulgate translated into French with two hundred and twenty- eight plates by Dora. This colossal enterprise, for which as will be seen there was a German prototype, attracted immediate attention and the English publisher, Cassels, at once negotiated for an English edition, which appeared in 1866 and for many years strongly influenced English visual imagination. Dor6 was a very competent, almost slick engraver, painting on the block so as to secure vivid contrasts and with a trick of diaphanous effects for his very frequent angelic visitors.35 There were, as one admirer put it, 'such contrasts of light and dark, such lowering of overshadowed heaven, such wrath of storm and bickering of celestial forms . . . with much greater variety, Mr. Dord sometimes reminds us of the now almost forgotten genius of John Martin'.36 This is a reasonable comparison. Several of Dord's plates, the Samson carrying away the Gates of Gaza, the Plague of Darkness, the Apparition of the Army in the Heavens (2 Maccabees V, 2), the Babylon Fallen strongly recall Martin's architec- ture and mountains, and certainly Dord, who was a close friend of Thdophile 32 Blanche Roosevelt, Life and Reminiscences of Gustave Dord, 1853, pp. 331, 337. 33 Millicent Rose, Gustave Dord, 1946, p. 65. 34 Nos. 268-77.

BOASE Gautier, a convinced admirer of Martin, 'le grand peintre des 6normitds dis- parues', must have been acquainted with engravings by his English pre- decessor.37 There are, however, many other influences on Dora. His architecture is fantastic enough, but more knowledgeable than that of Martin. Egyptology had become much more accessible, and Layard's Discoveries in the Ruins of Nineveh and Babylon had been published in I853. The French romantics had created a more authentic picture of the East, and certainly Horace Vernet's Arabs and camels, as seen for instance in his Judah and Tamar in the Wallace Collection, supplemented Dord's inadequate and secondhand knowledge of the Near East. 'The artist has no personal knowledge of the East, and has therefore been obliged to compile his acces- sories (if the expression may be allowed) from books and museums.'38 It is a long way from the desperate sincerity of Holman Hunt, but Dora had the recipe for popularity. Not surprisingly the plates vary in quality, and are perhaps at their best in the less ambitious scenes such as Hagar and Ishmael and Elijah and the Angel (P1. 65a). In more violent incidents, by no means avoided, his weakness in muscular anatomy becomes apparent, sometimes disturbingly. He has a nice sense of horror (The Death of Jezebel and The Lions of Samaria, from II Kings xvii, 25, but more suited to the Vulgate rendering than that of the Authorized Version), and his inventiveness is admirable. There are singularly few echoes, though even Dord finds it impossible to deal with Heliodorus without remembering Raphael. Earlier than Dord another artist had undertaken single-handed the illu- stration of the Bible. Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld had as far back as 1824, when in Rome with Overbeck, started on a series of drawings for wood- engravings, which eventually appeared in I85I as the Bilderbibel with two hundred and forty plates. An English edition appeared in 1i860 and went through several editions.39 The firm drawing and Nazarene simplification of design, the 'emphaticality' admired by Madox Brown, suited well the medium employed. In the New Testament illustrations Schnorr sometimes falls back on Raphaelesque imitation,40 but in the Old Testament, mainly earlier work, his imaginative powers are considerable and arresting. His Rahab and the Spies (P1. 64d) for instance is a reconstruction of the event with an original force of design that any Pre-Raphaelite must have envied. The introduction to the English edition states that 'He has treated most of the subjects ideally rather than literally . . . At the same time this idealism is blent with an in- comparable naturalness. The pictures surround us, so to speak, with the very atmosphere of the Biblical history. We feel ourselves in the midst of Oriental scenes and customs.' This is strikingly not the case with Schnorr's very generalized draperies and settings, where an occasional Egyptian relief is the only concession to archaeology, but it shows what the public had come to expect of biblical illustration. The English edition contained one hundred and eighty pictures: the Apocrypha was omitted as well as some scenes 'not 3' J. Seznec, John Martin en France, 1964, pp. 24-27. 38 E.

Whatever their deficiencies in some respects, those vigorous images were not without their influence. The Dalziel brothers, whose names bulk so large in any account of en- graving in the second half of the nineteenth century, long planned the issue of a Bible illustrated with woodcuts by leading English painters. The scheme was begun in the early sixties, and, for instance, Holman Hunt's Eliezer and Rebekah at the Well (P1. 64a) is dated 1863, but there were endless delays and the results were eventually published in I880 not as an illustrated Bible but as a 'Bible Gallery', a collection of plates similar to that of Schnorr, but con- siderably less numerous. Leighton, Poynter, Watts, Madox Brown, Pickers- gill, Walker, Houghton, Solomon, Sandys, Burne-Jones, were amongst the con- tributors, but Leighton is the impressive and dominating figure. His Death of Abel (P1. 64b) is a remarkable reinterpretation of a well-worn theme and his Abram and the Angel (P1. 64c), a subject he had particularly selected, shows his very skilful use of great, smooth planes. Madox Brown's plates are exactly the reverse, crowded and agitated. Joseph's Coat and Elisha and the Shunamite's Son were both to be used for paintings and are more effective in that medium than as printed from the wood-block; The Death of Eglon must be one of the curiosities of biblical illustration (P1. 65c); the fatness of Eglon is given full value and one can only be thankful that Brown stopped short before Ehud's left-handed blow was delivered and 'the haft also went in after the blade' (Judges iii, 22). Frederick Walker, a somewhat surprising choice for the subject apart from his close Dalziel associations, shows a gaunt, rough-clad Elijah suc- coured by the raven (P1. 65b), a striking contrast both to the placidly draped Elijah of Gustave Dord and the athletic, twisted form in Leighton's painting in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, a painting into which he said that he had put more of himself than any other he ever invented, and one where, unusually, he achieves in paint some of the boldness that characterizes his woodcuts (P1. 65e). Edward Poynter, whose vast Visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon is now one of the embarrassments of the National Gallery of New South Wales, was deeply committed to the new archaeological exactitude and the fascination of reconstructing ancient architecture, whose imagined pristine splendour was now replacing the glamour of ruins. His Joseph before Pharaoh has all the panoply of correct capitals, peacock fans, Egyptian robes and, perhaps, little else (P1. 65d). F. R. Pickersgill contributed several some- what insipid plates, among them a version of Rahab and the Spies (P1. 64e); Leighton chose the same theme (P1. 64f), and clearly had been influenced in his design by that of Schnorr (P1. 64d). A. Murch, an artist unknown to Thieme-Becker, designed, unimpressively, the incident of Joash and the Arrow of Deliverance. Millais was not a member of the team that worked for the Dalziel Bible Gallery, but in 1862 he had contributed to James Nisbet and Co's Lays of the Holy Land from Ancient and Modern Poets a design of The Finding of Moses, which is one of the most daring Pre-Raphaelite reinterpretations of a well- known subject. The other illustrations were largely topographical worked up from sketches by other hands. Birket Foster's Jerusalem was certainly not made 'on the spot', for he had never travelled so far from his beloved Surrey. A new</page><page sequence="20">364 T. S. R. BOASE note, however, is sounded on the title page, where it is claimed that some of the drawings are from photographs. This is a claim repeated in a more popular work that appeared in 1874, when Cassells, the publishers of the Dord Bible, followed it up with an Illustrated Bible with 'more than nine hundred highly finished engravings executed by eminent British and Foreign Artists'. Few of these engravings are signed and the artists are not easily identifiable, apart from some borrowings from Raphael and Michelangelo. They are conventional 'historical' pieces, competent but without any special interest. Here again some of the views are stated to be from photographs. Francis Frith (1822-98) had in 1856 brought back from Egypt a series of photographs which were published as a set of stereoscopic views. The following year Frith visited Palestine and c. i86o appeared his Egypt, Sinai and Palestine, 'probably the largest photographically- illustrated book ever published'.41 The Queen's Bible, illustrated with Frith's photographs, appeared in 1862, limited to 170 copies at fifty guineas each. 'Faithful representations' were what Frith claimed to have provided, but he admitted that such truthfulness might be dull. There were, too, many difficulties in working the collodion process in a hot climate, with only a suffocating tent as a dark room. 'In a smothering little tent.., with my collodion fizzing... it is truly marvellous that the results should be present- able at all.' But if to our eyes the photographs lack contrast and sometimes distinctness, they came at the time with a quite new authority. Photography, however, was only a rival. The aims of Holman Hunt were taken up by an artist who, like Dord, though French had close English con- nexions. J. James Tissot had been a successful painter in Paris, but owing to his associations with the Commune had to take refuge in England in I871. He remained in London till the early eighties, and then, it seems as the result of some personal tragedy, returned to France. He was known as a painter of smartly dressed ladies and their companions, influenced, though not at all profoundly, by the early Impressionists. He was still painting in his old manner in the first years of his return to Paris, when suddenly he decided to devote himself to the rendering of the scenes of the life of Christ in their actual setting. 'For a long time', he wrote in the Preface to his Life of Our Saviour Jesus Christ, 'the imagination of the christian world has been led astray by the fancies of artists; there is a whole army of delusion to be overturned . Is it not time in this exact century, when such words as nearly or almost have no longer any value, to restore to reality-I do not say the realism-the rights which have been filched from it?' In 1886 he left for Egypt and Palestine, returning to Paris the following year. Nine years later an exhibition of three hundred and sixty drawings of the Life of Christ was held in Paris and created something of the awed response that had been accorded to Dor6. The exhibition came to London and Lemercier of Paris paid the artist one million francs for the rights of reproduction. An English edition was brought out in 1897-98, dedicated to Gladstone. Topographically Tissot is extremely exact. The local scenery is well realized, and the book is decorated with architectural details taken from the Temple area or the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. His 41 H. and A.

His designs have considerable interest, and, particularly in the scenes of the Passion, some power, but his gifts were not equal to the vast task he had set himself. Much of the work is on the level of adequate visual reporting such as the illustrated journals were now making familiar. In 1896 Tissot returned to Palestine to work on the Old Testament, and was still working on drawings for it when he died in 1904.42 These designs differ considerably from those of the New Testament. Tissot invented a ferocious, bearded primitive type for the early Jewish heroes, showing a marked partiality for the more bloodthirsty scenes. At times it seems more a Niebelung than a biblical world, and more and more the formulas of con- temporary reportage, with here and there the new rhythms of art nouveau, are employed. The drawings were probably little known and therefore not influential, but they are in the trend of much Edwardian book illustration. In the Dalziel Bible Gallery Pre-Raphaelite and Nazarene impulses meet, but by the time it appeared the Pre-Raphaelite movement had divided into very different styles, connected, very misleadingly, only by the personality of Rossetti, who had long left behind him the principles of exact and accurate representation enunciated by Holman Hunt. Ruskin, however, continued to claim Rossetti as the true Pre-Raphaelite, and thereby extended the name to Rossetti's disciple, Edward Burne-Jones. Most of his biblical scenes were cartoons for stained glass, many of them single figures of angels or Old Testament characters. His most famous biblical design, The Adoration of the Kings, was first made for a tapestry (Exeter College, Oxford) but was later (1890) carried out as a very large water-colour (8 ft. 5 ins. x 12 ft. 8 ins.) for the Corporation of Birmingham. As a use of the medium it is an astonishing achievement, and the clear but subdued tones fit exactly with the wistful, vaguely ethereal figures of Burne-Jones's imagination. There is here a new influence from the past. When the Pre-Raphaelite movement was formed in I848, Botticelli was a comparatively unknown name. Fuseli, writing in I805, referred to 'his barbarous taste and dry minuteness' and as late as 187o Pater, in the essay that finally established his restored esteem, could still state that 'his name was little known in the last century'. He first reached the National Gallery in I855 with two purchases, from different sources, both school pieces and both tondos, the feeble Madonna and Child with St. John and Angels and the far finer Madonna and Child with two Angels, by one of the ablest hands in the workshop. Two years later with the Lombardi-Baldi Collection a more autograph but damaged picture, the long panel of the Adoration, entered the Gallery, but it was not till 1874 with the Mars and Venus and 1878 with the Mystic Nativity that there was any approach to a satisfactory representation of him, though the last had been in England since about I799 and had been on the London art market in the forties and exhibited in Manchester in 1857. Writing from Italy in I871, at the age of thirty-nine, Edward Burne-Jones states that he 'never even wanted to look at Titian', and that he 'saw the 42 La Sainte Bible (Ancien Testament), Paris 1904: limited to 560 copies, the first twenty of which each contained an original water- colour. All volumes had varying states of the heliogravures.</page><page sequence="22">366 T. S. R. BOASE Raphaels at Rome for the first time as unaffected by them as I can see the cartoons in London'. But Giotto at Sta. Croce and Botticelli everywhere seemed full of the inspiration that he went to look for, and throughout his life Botticelli remained the great canon of art. In 1895 he said to a friend 'Michael Angelo shirks sometimes, but Botticelli never; he thinks well about it before he begins, and does what is beautiful always'. Some of the poses, of the delicacy of lineament, Burne-Jones could echo. He could create a mythical world of his own that impressed itself on popular imagination, but he could not come near the force and conviction of his exemplar. A certain feebleness pervades the whole work from his curiously boneless figures. When he went to see Tissot's designs from the Life of Christ, exhibited in the Dor6 Gallery, he summarized his views as follows. 'There was the Annunciation: I want to see the Virgin's face and her little expression, I'm not to be put off with turban and burnous instead. That won't do-it is not enough. It was only the view of an Arab woman's dress as she sits on the ground. I have no dislike to Arab dress in itself, and it is probably not unlike what was worn at the time- things change so little in the East-but it is no use trying to put me off with it in place of the subject' (P1. 66c). 'What has become of the Dor6 pictures that they've turned out to make way for these? Poor Dor6, he was really an imaginative man. Out of the 15,000 designs that he did, a hundred of them are wonderful-which is saying a very great deal.'43 His own Annunciation, with its Renaissance architectural perspective, its relief of the Expulsion, its elaborate, almost art nouveau angel is the antithesis of all the historical sincerity to which Holman Hunt and Tissot had devoted themselves (P1. 66a). His Eli'ah and the Raven (P1. 65f) is a smooth, unreal figure beside Walker's rough-clad prophet (P1. 65b). The symbolism of a painting such as The Scapegoat was carried further in the work of another painter, G. F. Watts. Some of his paintings, such as his celebrated Hope, Love and Life and Love and Death, use allegorical figures, and this use was his expressed aim: 'I do not know whether the world has grown out of or not yet come to my view that the highest art is that which, taking for its means of expression line and colour descriptive of human form, should perhaps, more like music than poetry, suggest the highest emotions, sentiments, and phases of thought as the outward manifestation of humanity'.44 His directly biblical paintings are few, but some of them such as For he had great possessions (Tate Gallery: 1893-94) enjoyed much popularity. The single figure, the head bowed and turned away, the tension shown only in the fingers of the hand, formed a striking image that told a clear message (P1. 66b). This didactic, symbolic painting was much in vogue at the turn of the century and its most publicized exponent was Sigsmund Goetze, whose paintings such as The Ever-open Door (Toronto), an encouraging term for the Last Judgement, combined traditional religious iconography with elements of the contemporary scene: at the time it was talked about, preached about and considered deeply serious. Today it seems a somewhat repellent mixture. But it belongs to the turn of the century and is an Edwardian rather than Victorian phase, with 43 G.B.J., Memorials of Edward Burne-Jones, 1909, ii, p. 281. " M. S.

The old formulas for Christian communication in visual terms still had, and continue to have, some vitality, but new theories of response to non-representational forms were soon to become dominant in European and American art, and these new aesthetic experiences were to be one factor in the search of the mid- century for less anthropomorphic imagery, visual or verbal, in its contempla- tion of God.</page></plain_text>
