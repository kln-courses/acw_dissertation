<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERODOTUS' ENCOMIUM OF ATHENS: SCIENCE OR RHETORIC? In his Encomium of Athens, Herodotus claims that Athens was the savior of Greece during the Persian Wars (Hdt. 7.139). The claim is a central one in the Histories; it was also controversial, as Herodotus him- self tells us. Therefore, we can expect him to have taken great care in developing his defense of it, and to have used the strongest arguments available in its support. It should therefore offer us valuable insight into the way in which developments in causal argument by professionals (sophists, natural scientists, and doctors) were adapted and used by an intelligent and informed "layman" in the latter part of the fifth century. I give the passage in the translation of Rawlinson: And here I feel constrained to deliver an opinion, which most men, I know, will dislike, but which, as it seems to me to be true, I am deter- mined not to withhold. Had the Athenians, from fear of the approaching danger, quitted their country, or had they without quitting it submitted to the power of Xerxes, there would certainly have been no attempt to resist the Persians by sea; in which case, the course of events by land would have been the following. Though the Peloponnesians might have carried ever so many breastworks across the Isthmus, yet their allies would have fallen off from the Lacedaemonians, not by voluntary deser- tion, but because town after town must have been taken by the fleet of the barbarians; and so the Lacedaemonians would at last have stood alone, and, standing alone, would have displayed prodigies of valour, and died nobly. Either they would have done thus, or else, before it came to that extremity, seeing one Greek state after another embrace the cause of the Medes, they would have come to terms with King Xerxes; and thus, either way Greece would have been brought under Persia. For I cannot under- stand of what possible use the walls across the Isthmus could have been, if the King had had the mastery of the sea. If then a man should now say that the Athenians were the saviors of Greece, he would not exceed the truth. For they truly held the scales, and whichever side they espoused must have carried the day. They too it was who, when they had deter- mined to maintain the freedom of Greece, roused up that portion of the Greek nation which had not gone over to the Medes, and so, next to the gods, they repulsed the invader. In an article published in 1979, Evans discussed this passage, fo- cusing on its date and the evidence which it offers for Herodotus' atti- American Journal of Philology 108 (1987) 746-758 ? 1987 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">HERODOTUS' ENCOMIUM OF ATHENS tude toward Athens.' Relatively little attention, however, has been di- rected to the argumentation of the Encomium. What recent comment there has been has taken as its basis an article published in 1940 by Kleinknecht, which focused on the Encomium as an instance of the use of counterfactual conditional ("hypothetischen Form des Irrealis").2 Kleinknecht argued that the model which Herodotus used can be found in Ionian physical science and medicine; he offered as a parallel an ar- gument in Hippocrates, Ancient Medicine 1. The Hippocratic argu- ment may be paraphrased as follows:3 The art of medicine exists. If it did not exist, then all practitioners would be equally inexperienced and unlearned. But all practitioners are not equally inexperienced and unlearned. Therefore, the art exists. In fact, however, this is quite different from the argument in Herodotus' Encomium. The Hippocratic argument is a form of empirical indirect proof, in which a thesis is established by positing its denial and finding a contradiction with facts otherwise known. It is used by the Hippocratic writer to support a claim about a certain state of affairs, not to establish a causal claim.4 In contrast, in the Encomium Herodotus seeks to estab- 'J.A.S.

Lloyd, Analogy and Polarity (Cambridge 1966) 103-127, discusses the use of indirect proof by the philosophers and Sophists; see too F. Solmsen, Intellectual Experiments of the Greek Enlightenment (Princeton 1975) Chapter 1. In philosophy, the focus was on the development of contradictions within the argument itself (deductive indirect proof), while Sophistic use developed a freer form which allowed for contradic- tions with otherwise accepted facts. The main problem with the method is that the alter- natives often do not exhaust the possibilities, as is clear with the examples from Gorgias' Helen; nonetheless, it was popular because, regardless of its logical weakness, it appar- ently proved effective in persuading audiences. As I will outline below, a number of pas- sages within the text of Herodotus which Kleinknecht offers as parallel to 7.139 are also indirect proof: 2.43, 146; 4.118-19, 185; 8.119; only 3.49; 4.140; and 8.30 are counter- factual conditional causal arguments; other arguments which he cites fall into various other categories: advice/gnomic: 1.170; 7.10, 50; hindsight 3.25, 55; 8.103, 113; finally, 747</page><page sequence="3">NANCY DEMAND lish a causal claim, and he does it by demonstrating that, had the al- leged cause not occurred, the effect would not have occurred. The basis of his argument is a counterfactual interpretation of causality: he un- derstands "A causes B," to mean, "If A had not occurred, B would not have occurred."5 Thus, in order to prove that the persistence of Athens was the cause of the salvation of Greece, he considers the consequences of the counterfactual hypothesis: suppose that the Athenians had not stayed and fought. By a chain of argument, he procedes from this coun- terfactual to show that, had the Athenians not stood their ground, Greece would have fallen to the Persians. If Herodotus had used indirect proof in the Encomium, he would have argued from the negation of the hypothesis which he was seeking to establish: "The Athenians were not the cause of the salvation of Greece," rather than, as he did, from the counterfactual premise, "The Athenians failed to stand and fight." The distinction between the two types of argument is perhaps best expressed in terms of orders of dis- course: counterfactual causal arguments are first-order arguments, 7.168 is not a counterfactual at all, but a simple future prediction. Diller, Hermes 67 (1932) 25-9, discusses the use of indirect proof in causal argument. A good example appears in the Clouds of Aristophanes (369ff.), when Strepsiades argues that it is the clouds, and not Zeus, that cause rain: if Zeus were the cause of rain, it would rain even when clouds were absent, which is not the case. 5The interpretation of causality in terms of counterfactuals is not common. Hume does mention it briefly in Part 7 of An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding; it has found few proponents in contemporary philosophy, but it is still argued by a few. One example of a counterfactual analysis of causality is given by David Lewis in "Causation," Journal of Philosophy 70 (1973) 556-67. Lewis attempts to derive an analysis of causation from the "platitudes" which connect causality with counterfactuals: "We think of a cause as something that makes a difference, and the difference it makes must be a difference from what would have happened without it. Had it been absent, its effects-some of them, at least, and usually all-would have been absent as well. Yet it is one thing to mention these platitudes now and again, and another thing to rest an analysis on them (p. 557)." Herodotus is clearly in the class of the users of the "platitude," and not among those who analyze it. Lewis' attempt to provide an analysis of causality in terms of coun- terfactuals is refuted by J. Kim, "Causes and Counterfactuals," Journal of Philosophy 70 (1973) 570-72. No agreement upon an analysis of the concept of causality has been possi- ble for modern philosophy. Perhaps G.E.M. Anscombe is right in claiming that it is an unanalyzable concept. The interested reader will find Miss Anscombe's arguments, to- gether with the two articles referred to above, and other related papers, in G. J. Warnock, ed., Causation and Conditionals (Oxford University Press 1975); a useful brief review of the current state of the question is M.

This is the basis of Herodotus' argument. The first requirement - whenever the cause is present, so too is the effect-establishes the cause as sufficient. It is this element which is missing in Herodotus' argument. This constitutes a fatal flaw, from the scientific point of view, and one which clearly was recognized in antiquity. The weakness of an argu- ment which does not establish sufficiency can be seen clearly in the case of recent reports of medical research about Delta hepatitis.8 The hepa- titis B virus is able to cause that particular form of the disease if and only if it interacts with the Delta virus, which in itself is incapable of producing disease. Thus, although both the hepatitis B virus and the Delta virus are necessary to the production of Delta hepatitis, neither alone is a sufficient condition, and thus neither can be called the cause of the disease. Thus the argument, "Hepatitis B virus causes Delta hep- atitis, because, if hepatitis B virus is absent, Delta hepatitis is also ab- sent," would not be a cogent argument. A similar situation in the case of the Persian Wars can be envisioned: Despite the refusal of the Atheni- ans to relocate or Medize, the Persians still might have won, if, for ex- ample, they had not lost so many ships in the early stages of the inva- 6Thus Diller (n. 4 above) who has studied the use of empirical indirect proofs in antiquity, classifies such proofs as logical even though they contain empirical material. He traces the original form back to Melissos (DK30 B8), and, in embryonic form, to Parmenides (DK28 B8). Zeno provides the clearest examples of the form, (DK29 B1) but it is also found in the philosopher Empedocles, (DK31 B17, 30-32) in eristic argument in Gorgias, (DK82 Bll, la) and in Aristophanes in parody in Clouds 331-34: "If Zeus caused rain, then it would rain without clouds." 7Hp.

In fact, Herodotus himself recognizes that the Athenians' decision was not a sufficient condition when he says that the Athenians were "next to the Gods" in this. It is also noteworthy that in a scientific con- text in Book 2, when he discusses the cause of the unusual behavior of the Nile, which floods in the summer, unlike other rivers which flood in the winter, Herodotus does recognize the need for a cause to be both necessary and sufficient.9 There Herodotus refutes the theory that the Etesian winds caused the flooding by providing, (a) an instance in which the cause is absent but the effect present, (which violates the require- ment that a cause be necessary), and (b) an instance in which the cause is present but the effect absent (which violates the requirement that a cause be sufficient). He thus shows that he is familiar with an analysis of causation in terms of both necessary and sufficient conditions. Why did he not follow this pattern in the Encomium? Before we make a final judgment on this question we should consider his argument in a wider context; in particular, we should inquire whether the Encomium in fact belongs in a scientific context, and whether this makes any difference in the evaluation of the argument. Unfortunately, the use of counterfactual statements in Greek liter- ature as a whole, has not yet received a full and systematic study. Kleinknecht's discussion does not distinguish adequately between the various uses of counterfactuals, and especially between their use in indi- rect proof and in causal argument.'l Another analysis of the form was made by Krischer, l but he confined his attention mainly to non-argu- mentative instances taken from Homer, who used the form for empha- sis, and to Thucydides. He noted only three cases of counterfactuals in Herodotus (1.27, 2.172, and 7.152), none of which occurs in a causal argument. He did not discuss the Encomium, although he did mention Thucydides 1.74.4, which is almost a summary statement of the argu- ment of the Encomium. While it is beyond the scope of this paper to provide the missing full-scale analysis of the use of counterfactuals in Greek literature through the fifth century, it will be possible and useful to examine the full spectrum of Herodotus' own use of counterfactual conditionals, making clear the various contexts in which he used the 'Hdt. 2.20-26, esp. 20 on the Etesian winds.

' This will provide a basis for deciding in which context the argu- ment of the Encomium belongs. Since our main interest is in the Encomium, which employs a counterfactual in a causal argument, we will begin with other examples in which Herodotus uses counterfactuals for causal argument. As we have seen, in this type of argument, Herodotus "thinks away" the cause, A, and determines if the effect would still result; if it would not, then he concludes that A is the cause. It should be noted that three of the exam- ples (four, including the Encomium) are judgmental: 3.49: The cause of the Corinthian expedition against Samos was not the grievance which they claimed, but rather the long-standing enmity between themselves and the Kerkyrans. If those two had been good friends, the Corinthians would never have under- taken the expedition for this reason. (Herodotus argues that, had the cause, enmity, not existed, neither would the effect.) 4.140: The blame for the Scythians' missing the enemy's line of march must fall upon themselves: if they had not ravaged pastures and filled wells, they would have found the Persians easily. 8.30: The motive which swayed the Phocians in their decision not to Medize was not their concern to avoid betraying Greece, as they claimed, but their hatred of the Thessalians, which led them to take the opposing side in any endeavour in which they and the Thessalians were involved. If the Thessalians had declared for the Greeks, the Phocians would have Medized. 2.26: The sun is the cause of the air in Egypt being hot (and thus also the cause of the flooding of the Nile). If the heavens were re- versed, the sun would be in upper Europe, and it would affect the Ister just as it now effects the Nile (while the Nile would then be unaffected).13 12I take the examples collected by Kleinknecht as a basis for this investigation. While his collection may not include every example which could be found (it is not al- ways easy to classify a given argument), it is sufficiently comprehensive to give an idea of the range of the use of this type of statement by Herodotus. '3G.E.R. Lloyd claims that the counterfactual in this case functions not as a proof but as a "thought-experiment," making Herodotus' case more vivid and understandable, Magic, Reason and Experience (Cambridge 1979) 24, 68-69, 158, n. 169. Lloyd points out that such thought-experiments were relatively common among the pre-Socratics. For example, Xenophanes used one to oppose the traditional Greek anthropomorphic con- ception of the gods: "If oxen and horses and lions had hands and could draw with their hands and produce works of art like men, horses would draw the forms of the gods like 751</page><page sequence="7">NANCY DEMAND Unlike the first three arguments, the fourth takes account of both neces- sary and sufficient conditions: if the cause is present, the effect is present (sufficient); if it is absent, so also is the effect (necessary). Judgments of hindsight are closely allied to these causal argu- ments; it seems worthwhile, however, to try to distinguish between the two by the lesser degree to which the causal factor is explicit in judg- ments of hindsight. These judgments follow the familiar counterfactual pattern: "If you had worn your hat, you wouldn't have that cold." Such statements clearly stress responsibility, while the causal factor is more implicit: "You have only yourself to thank for that cold, since you didn't wear your hat." In four of these cases, Herodotus uses the form to ex- press his own opinion, usually a judgment of moral blame or praise; the fifth is similarly judgmental, but occurs in a rhetorical context. It is noteworthy that two arguments which are explicitly causal, the Enco- mium and 4.140, also fit into this category of hindsight judgments. Ex- amples of hindsight judgments are: 8.103: Xerxes would not have remained in Greece after Salamis, even if his counsellors had advised it, because he was afraid. 3.55: If all the Spartans had behaved as Archais and Lycopas did, Sa- mos might have been taken. 3.25: On the expedition against the Ethiopians, if Cambyses had con- fessed to being wrong when the provisions first failed, he would have done the wisest thing he could have, given his initial mis- take. 9.113: Masistes set out to stir up revolt in Bactria and get revenge on Xerxes. He would have accomplished this, if he had not been slain on the way by Xerxes' men. 7.50: Xerxes answers Artabanes (in 7.10) with a rebuke: If those before me on the throne had listened to counsellors of such spirit, Persia would never have reached its present height of power. Passing from these instances of counterfactual conditional causal arguments to causal arguments which utilize empirical indirect proof, a horses, and oxen like oxen, and they would make their bodies such as each of them had themselves" (DK21 B15). And, closer to Herodotus in subject matter, Heraclitus sug- gests, "If there were no sun, it would be night on account of the other stars" (DK22 B99). But all counterfactual arguments are in essence thought-experiments. The Encomium is certainly one, since we cannot change the facts of past history to find out what would have happened. 752</page><page sequence="8">HERODOTUS' ENCOMIUM OF ATHENS passage from Aristophanes' Clouds can serve as a useful model for this argument form: "If Zeus caused rain, then it would rain without clouds." This Aristophanic passage may, in fact, be a parody of Hero- dotus' use of the form for arguments about natural phenomena: 2.20: If the Etesian winds were the cause of the flooding of the Nile, then other rivers would show the same effect. In fact, they don't. Therefore, the Etesian winds are not the cause. 2.22: If melting snows caused the Nile floods, then there would be snow in the south. The strongest proof that this is not the case - that there is no snow in the south-is the fact that the winds blow hot from the south. A second proof is the lack of rain in the south; and a third, the signs of heat in the south, such as the black skin of the inhabitants and the fact that the birds there do not migrate with the seasons. Therefore, there can be no snow in the south, and, therefore, melting snow cannot be the cause of the Nile floods. 4.118-: In the Scythian speech to the Sauromatae, the Scythians try to 119 convince the Sauromatae to join in resistance to the Persians, offering a "strong proof': If the cause for the Persians' actions had been simply vengeance against Scythia, they would have marched straight to Scythia. They didn't march straight to Scy- thia. Therefore, this limited objective could not have been the cause of their march, and they threaten Scythia too.14 Herodotus also employs counterfactuals in empirical indirect proofs which are not causal: 8.119: This story about the return of Xerxes is not believable. If the need to lighten the ship had actually arisen, Xerxes would have 14This case falls into particular difficulty because the conclusion is not a simple negation of the causal statement. Herodotus does not conclude simply, "It is not the case that the cause for the Persians' advance was vengeance against the Scyths." Rather, he draws from the argument an alternative possibility: "The cause was a plan to subdue the entire territory." That he is not dealing with mutually exhaustive alternatives becomes clear when we consider that the Persians could have had wider, but still limited, objec- tives which did not include the Sauromatae. This confusion was by no means unique to Herodotus, however; G.E.R. Lloyd points out numerous examples of argument from non-exhaustive alternatives in this time period (n. 4 above) 103-27. While not techni- cally valid, such arguments were in fact often persuasive, and they were frequently used in rhetorical contexts as well as in philosophical argument. 753</page><page sequence="9">NANCY DEMAND made the noblemen on deck go below and row, and cast the lower-class rowers overboard. Not one man in 10,000 would doubt that this would have been what would really have hap- pened. Thus the story as told did not happen. 2.43: To prove that the Greeks took the name of Heracles from the Egyptians, and not visa versa, Herodotus argues that, if the Egyptians had taken any names of gods from Greece, they would have taken those of Poseidon and the Dioscuri first: both peoples practiced navigation. The Egyptians, however, did not adopt the names of Poseidon and the Dioscuri. Therefore, since the denial of the hypothesis results in a conflict with empirical fact, the hypothesis itself must be true. 2.146: Similarly, if Dionysus and Pan had been born as men in Greece, then stories would recount their wholly mortal birth, but this is not the case. (The Egyptians do know the origins of these gods; hence Pan and Dionysus must have originated in Egypt, and not in Greece.) 4.185: To prove that no rain falls in certain parts of Libya, Herodotus argues that, if it did rain, the salt houses built by the inhabitants would melt. But these houses do not melt: the denial of the hy- pothesis conflicts with actual events. Hence, the hypothesis is es- tablished: it does not rain in these parts of Libya. Finally, in addition to these applications of counterfactual condi- tionals in argument and proof, Herodotus also uses counterfactual con- ditionals in a non-argumental way in the giving of advice, either in spe- cific cases or in gnomic statements: 7.10: If no more than one opinion is uttered, it is impossible to choose the best. 7.152: If every nation were to bring its evil deeds to a given place, in order to exchange them with some other nation, when they looked carefully at their neighbors' faults, they would be glad to carry their own back again. 1.27: Bias to Croesus: If the Islanders were to attack you with cavalry, you would rejoice because of your superiority in that method of fighting. Therefore, consider that if you were to attack them with ships, they would rejoice. 7.50: If in each matter you look to all possible chances, you'll never accomplish anything. 754</page><page sequence="10">HERODOTUS' ENCOMIUM OF ATHENS 1.170: Bias to the Ionians facing the threat of Persia: if you stay in Ionia, you will never recover your lost freedom; if you co-operate in migrating to Sicily, you will be free and rich. Of these 21 instances of counterfactual conditionals in Herodotus, five (including the Encomium) are used in counterfactual causal argu- ments; five in quasi-causal hindsight judgments, and seven in indirect proof (these include three causal arguments). In addition, there are five cases of simple non-argumental use in maxims or the giving of advice. The context is rhetorical in four caes (1.27; 1.170; 4.118-119; 7.50), scientific in four cases (2.20; 2.22; 2.26; 4.185; this would be six cases if we consider the two related arguments about the origins of the gods, 2.43 and 2.146, as scientific, or quasi-scientific), and advisory or judg- mental in 12 cases. However, it should be noted that three of the scien- tific usages occur in a single discussion on the Nile flood, and that the two quasi-scientific arguments also belong to a single argument context, although they are separated in the text. This analysis provides strong evidence that the predominant use of counterfactual conditionals in Herodotus lies in the area of maxim, judgment, and rhetoric, that is, in traditional usages, rather than in scientific arguments. This evidence for a basically rhetorical context of the Encomium is reinforced when we consider the most immediately evident and impres- sive aspect of the passage, the chain of reasoning by which Herodotus develops his argument. In this chain, he argues that if Athens had fled or capitulated, in either case there would have been no resistance by sea. Even with the isthmus fortified, the allies of Lacedaemonia would have fallen (because attacked by sea), and Lacedaemonia would have stood alone. Then either the Lacedaemonians would have fought and been defeated, or they would have Medized). In either case, Greece would have fallen. Therefore, if the Athenians had not stood their ground, Greece would have fallen. The reasoning involved in this chain utilizes both the transitive character of the causal relationship (if A causes B, and B causes C, then A causes C) and the disjunctive argu- ment form of the simple constructive dilemma (A or B; if A then C; if B then C; therefore C). The disjunctive argument technique of the polylemma was a method which was popular with the Sophists. It was used by Gorgias in both the Helen and the Palamedes. More significant in terms of date, however, is the trilemmic argument which appears in Euripides' (sec- 755</page><page sequence="11">NANCY DEMAND ond) Hippolytus, produced in 428.15 Hippolytus defends himself by eliminating possible motivations for the crime: Could he have acted be- cause of Phaedra's beauty? No. Because of desire for the wealth which he would inherit from Theseus? No. Because of a desire for the power of Theseus? No. Therefore, he could have had no motive and must be in- nocent. Euripides' use of a trilemma in a stage-trial demonstrates that it was familiar enough in the courts of Athens to serve as a mark of a "typi- cal" legal defense the year before the visit of the great Sophist Gorgias to Athens in 427. Herodotus' use of a polylemmic argument form in the Encomium thus points clearly to a rhetorical context. Since Herodotus is operating in a basically rhetorical context when he employs counterfactual conditionals, a parallel to his counterfactual conditional causal argument which appears in the work of Antiphon the rhetorician and sophist can legitimately be called upon to offer a clue to the way in which Herodotus viewed the argument.16 In the second of Antiphon's Tetrologies, he uses an argument which is formally very close to that employed by Herodotus in the Encomium. The case turns upon the responsibility for the death of a boy who was killed acciden- tally during javelin practice. The aspect of the argument which is rele- vant to the Encomium is found in the first reply of the defense: 17 If the victim had stood still and not run across the path of the javelin, he would not have been struck; therefore, he was the cause of his own death. An important element is clear in Antiphon's argument: the vic- tim, in running across the path of the javelin, acted in error, since he had been instructed to stand still during the throw; therefore, he was the responsible cause of his own death.

But in the Tetralogy it is the factor of hamartia which is decisive: of the several contributory ele- ments in a causal situation, that one carried out in error is the one which conveys responsibility. Other elements which operated as contributing causal factors are irrelevant. Thus the defense argues that the victim was in error when he ran, and that, therefore, he was the cause, that is, bore the responsibility for, the unexpected and undesired outcome of his action. Similarly, the goal of assigning responsibility in the Encomium is also crucial. This allows Herodotus to focus on that act in the causal nexus which was praiseworthy. That there were other contributory causes becomes, in essence, irrelevant. For example, the destruction by storm of many Persian ships off the Magnesian coast undoubtedly was a contributory cause of the eventual Greek victory; 9 without it, Athens' role may well not have been a sufficient cause of victory. But the storm was the responsibility of the gods, to whom Herodotus himself gives credit, and thus irrelevant to the determination of human responsibility for the victory. The same defense can, moreover, also be made of most of the other passages in which Herodotus utilizes counterfactual condi- tional causal arguments, for they also focus on merit and blame. An analysis of the argument in the Encomium in its wider context has shown that it has stronger links with the methods of rhetoric, and with Greek traditions of advice, maxim, praise, blame, and the simple judgments of hindsight, than it does with the argument methods of Ionian science. Such arguments, because of their focus on the determi- nation of responsibility, disregarded accessory causal factors which were irrelevant to this primary goal, thus in effect eliminating the require- ment of sufficiency.
