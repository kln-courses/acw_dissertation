<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shaping Information History as an Intellectual Discipline James W. Cortada Information is an emerging field of interest and concern to citizens, pub- lic officials, and scholars in many disciplines. This article acknowledges that problems exist in defining the subject of information history and ar- gues the case that the topic can be addressed in a more coherent fashion. It then poses five questions for historians to investigate with respect to this field and proposes a sequence of three strategies and an agenda for what scholars can do to make this topic a new field of inquiry called "infor- mation history," drawing upon the historiographical experiences of other areas of historical inquiry. Information as a field of study has become fashionable across many academic disciplines, although it has not developed fully into a stand-alone field. While the subject has its journals, departments, and disciplines, information yet has an inadequate supply of those intellec- tual infrastructures that make it possible to discuss the topic along the lines becoming increasingly popular, namely, as information history and, thus, as a central theme in the history of human activities. The notion of information history as a topic has been emerging as a subject to be understood and defined and as one that transcends existing boundaries of established intellectual discussions and their associated academic infrastructures. This trend holds out the possibility of the subject ac- quiring its own identity, as with political science, macroeconomics, or diplomatic history. Bridging the gap between the evolving conversation about information history and existing academic disciplines, facilities, and communities for sustaining that dialogue remains a fundamental task facing scholars, including historians. While readers of this text may feel any discussion about the impor- tance of information history is simply "preaching to the converted," exploring the nature of that importance is as essential as probing the contours of the topic's definition and related agendas. The subject is important for different reasons, depending on whether one is look- ing at economic or business history, social and cultural history, library Information äf Culture, Vol. 47, No. 2, 2012 ©2012 by the University of Texas Press, PO Box 7819, Austin, TX 78713-7819</page><page sequence="2">1 20 I&amp;C/ Shaping Information History science or media, contemporary economics, information technolo- gies, biology, or public administration. Understanding these differing perspectives will help historians of information better understand what issues to investigate and how to shape the scope of their work because the worldview of library historians, or of those working in economic or business history alone, cannot encompass the full scope of the emerg- ing discussion about information. They represent tiny communities in comparison to the large number of disciplines and individuals who have opinions about the importance and role of information and its his- tory. Scholars in one discipline who ignore these various perspectives risk being marginalized in the larger conversation. So spending time understanding the importance of the topic is as relevant as engaging in discussions on the scope of the research agenda and the operational tasks needed to further energize information history as a field of study. This article focuses on the fundamental question about the role of information history from the perspective of a historian. It is motivated by fear that carts may be put before horses, that is, that there are gaps between bodies of knowledge to bridge, priorities to consider, actions to take to further the development of this subfield, and all in a practical sequence of activities. The notion of carts before horses reflects the con- cern that we may not learn from the useful paths of investigation trod by computer scientists, biologists, library and book historians, and others. Much might be lost to historians standing before this new subfield. Information as a topic worthy of study in its own right bubbled to the surface of our consciousness slowly throughout the twentieth cen- tury. Librarians were the first in a major profession in modern times to debate its nature and evolution in the 1950s and 1960s, almost "own- ing" the issue until computer scientists and others doing research on artificial intelligence, education, and cognition (brain studies) weighed in with massive quantities of industrial researchers, academics, studies, and publications.1 Out of that wave of activities came various examples of approaches that can serve as models for scholarship for those study- ing the history of traditional information domains.2 Today we have experts on media, political scientists, business managers, economists, and historians turning their attention to the role of information, often from a historical perspective. For more than fifteen years, historians have been wrestling with definitions and, just as important, mapping the contours of this field.3 Simultaneously, biologists are on a surge in their nearly seven-decade pursuit of their understanding of "feedback loops" (first proposed by a mathematician at MIT, Norbert Wiener) and the closely affiliated topic</page><page sequence="3">121 of neural networks, which became an important area for exploration in a variety of fields by the late 1960s.4 Business management experts are starting to move beyond discussing the role of information technologies (i.e., computers and software) to the essence of those technologies (i.e., the role of information) in modern organizations.5 Other scholars and experts have started to document the growth in the number of "infor- mation workers."6 In short, many hands are at work describing the role of information in both historical and contemporary terms. Information History - a Field of Its Own? The scope of that interest and activity begs the question, Is information history now a field of its own? The notion of information as an intrinsic subject is moving into the public consciousness. In 2011 a best-selling American book on the topic, The Information by James Gleick, addressed issues of information's evolution; underlying technologies; sciences that were both vessels and agents of its use (e.g., computing and genetics); and its links to cognition, biology, and the core language of science - mathematics.7 In the previous year the highly respected and widely read Economist began talking about Big Data, a theme picked up soon after by Wired magazine.8 By 2011 major consulting and information technology firms were addressing problems of Big Data, defining the issues, even discovering a "data paradox," in which there were too many data and not enough information that managers could act upon.9 Pharmaceutical companies and medical researchers had been wrestling with that issue for more than three decades, in the process creating a subfield now known as medical or health informatics.10 For information-processing companies like IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and others, this meant develop- ing software to collect, store, and manage terabytes of data; for firms like Google, it meant finding ways to navigate large files to find useful information. In short, a plethora of activities, interests, points of view, and professional and industry constituencies grew up around the no- tion of information. It seems we have never seen as much interest in information as that exhibited today. For those who assume responsibility for studying the role of informa- tion in society, making sense of these various approaches and perspectives is confusing and, even more irritating, ambiguous. Economists such as Michael Spence win Nobel Prizes for studying the asymmetry of infor- mation, while other Nobel laureates, such as Douglas C. North, plead for a retreat from mathematical determinism and arcane models and a return to the historian's narrative of economics and its underlying base</page><page sequence="4">1 22 I&amp;C/ Shaping Information History of information.11 Other economists, sociologists, and business manage- ment experts explore the role of information, "path dependencies," and knowledge economics, coining terms like "knowledge workers" and "knowledge management." The divergence of approaches is the result of traditions of research in subsets of a discipline, such as a propensity to favor mathematical approaches or historical narratives.12 In the pro- cess of these various traditions of research, new perspectives are formed that shape the discourse about a topic. That is what appears to be hap- pening with the general subject of information history. Historians are discovering that there were "information ages" before the one we live in now.13 These scholars have concluded that the slaves, women, and peasants who lived in many eras played important roles whose history merits study. To a large degree, historians have nearly deserted the elite classes as subjects of investigation and in the process have created new research agendas. In each instance, historians assign to a period of time a name that they argue reflects an overwhelmingly important feature of that time, such as the use of slavery or computers, or accentuates a point of view or emphasis, such as the role of women, personal computers, or books. We are witnessing what appears to be the growth of a whole new subfield of history and associated disciplines in the social sciences and humanities: the study of the role of informa- tion in current and prior times. Long gone are the days when one could conveniently point to the work of Charles Van Doren and his book, A History of Knowledge , and feel that the topic was covered.14 Today this pi- oneering study seems naïve, and its advertising tagline even more so: "Here is a compendium of everything that humankind has thought, invented, created, considered, and perfected from the beginning of civi- lization into the twenty-first century." All in less than 450 pages! Yet as Alistair Black asked as recently as 2008, with all of this activity, "what chance is there that [information's] definition might be historicized?"15 The Need for a Path Forward and a Strategy for Scholarship So what questions should scholars now pose of the topic of information, most specifically, of its history? Is the research on this topic an extension of the artifactual strategies of the past, in which the emphasis was on the history of manuscripts, books, and, most recently, computers, telecom- munications, and the Internet? Is it an extension of media studies, with the ghost of Marshall McLuhan rising to be rediscovered much as the nineteenth century's Charles Babbage became important a century later with the wide adoption of computers in Western societies, which he</page><page sequence="5">123 anticipated through his own efforts to build calculating engines? More important, what might be a path forward for those interested in examin- ing the history and use of information? Building on existing intellectual frameworks, this article presents a tactical, operational set of suggestions. This subject deserves episte- mologica! discussion and historiographical debate, but those issues will be largely ignored here because there are more mundane matters to address. However, one should acknowledge that solid attempts have al- ready been made by others to describe - indeed, to use Black's word, to "map" - areas of investigation, so that we can build on their good work.16 The need for historians to study the role of information is only par- tially justified by historiographical principles, although to be sure those who looked at the topic came to believe that the role of information was central to the actions of people.17 Public officials and business man- agers learned increasingly to accept historical perspectives and so to turn to historians for some answers because, if nothing else, the Internet alone made millions of authority figures aware of the importance of the subject.18 What scholars should say about information continues to be the subject of debate. Which issues should be explored by those teaching "information studies" and social sciences, fields that themselves seem to be evolving into information studies? Universities started in the late twentieth century to set up centers for the study of information that were rarely staffed with historians, although often with scholars sensi- tive to historical issues, such as Tony Oettinger at Harvard University's Program on Information Resources Policy (probably the first of such centers, established in 1973) and Kenneth L. Kraemer, who has man- aged various centers of information studies at the University of California at Irvine for several decades.19 When faced with a similar challenge to define how historians should study the history of software, Michael S. Mahoney wondered, "What's so hard? What are we missing?" He defined the problem as one of "lots of answers but very few ques- tions, lots of stories but no history." In short, he had no sense of how to write the history of computing.20 These very good questions about the history of computing apply to the larger field of the history of information. When Mahoney made his observations in the 1980s and 1990s, the history of computing was nescient but also further along than the new subfield increasingly be- ing labeled "information history." So while we can, and should, borrow extensively from his thinking and that of Black, Buckland, Liu, and others, there are additional broad issues to be addressed. The first is</page><page sequence="6">1 24 I&amp;C/ Shaping Information History to understand what scholars and users of information are dealing with within the context of their current scholarly and personal environments. These various issues might best be addressed by first defining the challenges before us. The following section describes the three basic problems to engage with, influenced largely by perspectives drawn from scholarship in business and information technology's history. Next, since scholarship is normally about asking and answering questions, this text poses five such questions that are central to the theme of this essay: how to shape this new subfield called information history. There are un- doubtedly others we could ask, but these five represent those essential to focus on first if this subject is to have a history and more clearly define its own personality. Several fundamental, strategic recommendations for a way forward are further offered. The central point is that informa- tion as a subfield of history is important, is being studied, remains too ambiguous for many scholars, and can be more precisely defined and examined, following in the highest traditions of "doing good history." The Problems of Information Information study is serious business, not an ephemeral intellectual exercise. The 9/11 Commission, examining what led to the attacks in New York City and Washington, DC, on September 11, 2001, and how it was that the US government could not prevent them, largely focused on the management of information or, more precisely, the lack of use of extant pieces of information to anticipate and block the attacks be- fore they occurred. In the process of placing the issue of information at the center of the nation's vulnerability, the commission made the subject of information a major topic of discussion within the US gov- ernment in the following decade.21 The commission's recommendation that information needed to be shared horizontally across agencies and its uses studied and understood led directly to the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security (now the second-largest US govern- ment institution after the Department of Defense) and to antiterrorism strategies that were more information-centric than in prior eras of conflict, placing value on good police investigations more often than good combat effectiveness.22 This topic is also vital to business. Large corporations had libraries with books and journals for decades as well as training programs that often rivaled those of leading business graduate schools. They employed librarians and researchers credentialed with advanced degrees from prestigious universities. However, in the twentieth century these firms</page><page sequence="7">125 and their employees increasingly worked at jobs involving more exten- sive use of information and cognitive functions than in earlier times. A simple snapshot drawn from the American economy taken soon af- ter completion of the 9/11 Commission's work may be found at the US Census Bureau, which had in its collection of economic-industrial data a category called "Information" that included publishing, movies, music, broadcasting, and data processing (information technology), all of which it reported consisted of $551 billion in a total economy of $11.7 trillion. By that narrow definition, information work occu- pied nearly 5 percent of the world's largest economy; when one adds education, banking and finance, and government office workers, the percentage triples.23 Since there is information content in most work, such as in medicine and law enforcement, one might agree that the eco- nomic footprint of information in both the public and private sectors is far larger than these simple statistics would suggest. The scope of where information sits and is used in society is enlarged by the fact that it has always been present. Two early studies of the role of information in the United States from the 1700s to the present made it quite clear that information proved essential in the definition of the role of the national government through the US Constitution; in the establishment of the United States Post Office in 1775; and in the activi- ties of work, religion, education, entertainment, sports, and other facets of American society.24 In recent years a new generation of scholars has started to investigate the role of information in modern America, largely situated in the use of the Internet but also documenting the historical precedents of some uses of information.25 Each study has approached the topic of information in remarkably consistent ways, suggesting a use- ful path through which to define the issues at hand and how to deal with them from the perspective of the historian. They are consistent with the recommendations of Michael Mahoney that, over the past two decades, have served historians of computing and information technologies.26 Today we have three problems to address from the historian's per- spective. The first is to define what we mean by "information." Every historian working on the problem has attempted to resolve this difficulty yet found it challenging due, in the words of one student, to the "width of the proposed field."27 The second problem is to document informa- tion's role in society, how it has been used, and its consequences. The third is to do historical research by explaining the context in which in- formation has flourished and existed. Focusing on these three problems is a start and can keep scholars busy for many decades. It also practices good history.</page><page sequence="8">1 26 I&amp;C/ Shaping Information History With this list I do not mean to diminish the importance of the ar- tifact, long a preferred way to look at the history of information. For many decades historians have positioned the book as pńmis , and it remains a subject about which much more historical work should be done. In fact, artifactual history needs to continue because it is the na- ture of a technology - the artifact - that so often has such a compelling effect on the history of information, particularly its relative cost to users, physical portability (smallness), and dynamic flexibility (e.g., electronic or digital forms). The extensive debate about the future of the book is laced with voluminous historical perspectives, informing both historians and experts in media and industry but representing only one type of artifact out of many. Others are institutional, such as museums, librar- ies, booksellers, and reading clubs.28 It is no accident, for example, that one scholar referred to computers as the "knowing machines."29 In fact, one might want to expand the definition of the artifact to include other physical things such as the schoolhouse, since its configuration affected learning (as with the development of the blackboard in the nineteenth century and the resultant reorganization of students into rows facing the teacher). In a more ephemeral sense, one might consider the is- sue of literacy, without which much information could not have been collected, transferred, or used widely in the past four hundred years.30 Today we speak of "computer literacy" and "digital divides" in almost the same language as that we used to speak of reading illiteracy. The knowledge management community, made up of sociologists, phi- losophers, business managers, librarians, some cognitive scientists, and a mixture of computer scientists and media experts, has also struggled with the definition of information for several decades. Their definitions normally set data in a context like a sentence rather than just a num- ber. They have likewise pointed out the need to distinguish information from data and wisdom, with wisdom comprising tacit insight not neces- sarily derived from a specific piece of datum or information.31 Biologists, experts in cognition, and other scientists have chosen to emphasize the role of the brain.32 Other communities, such as those composed of me- dia experts and economists, have attempted to define information.33 In the 1950s, before librarians' preeminence in the topic was superseded by the massive growth in the number of computer scientists and hardware and software vendors by the end of the 1970s, librarians quite reasonably saw information as their hunting preserve. However, the essential con- clusion we must reach is that we still do not have a shared definition of information; consequently, neither do we have shared descriptions of its salient features, or the contours of information history.</page><page sequence="9">127 Does that matter? Social scientists, economists, some political scien- tists, and scholars in the physical sciences are strongly wedded to the concept that their work is to create understandings that become theories and laws of social and physical behavior. For them, definitions matter a great deal. Historians, on the other hand, are less reliant on theory- based investigations of the past, although many have flirted with that approach in recent decades.34 As a general statement, historians assume that no two events occur in the same way; rather, their role is to tell the story of what happened - a narrative - in a rich context. Because every event is unique, universally accepted definitions are not as necessary in this discipline, but they are useful if relevant to multiple situations. Good definitions of ideas and practices emerge in history after account- ing for many activities, often over very long periods of time, that suggest patterns of behavior. Another important tradition at work, beginning roughly in the 1920s in Europe and in the 1930s in the United States, was the scholarship and insight of the information school movement, in which library stud- ies was essentially a humanistic discipline, dominated by librarians, that in modern times began to borrow from the methods of the social sci- ences.35 Because that assimilation is a process still under way, the modern "iSchool" movement may still be searching for the right balance be- tween traditional historiography and the orientation of social scientists. Further, because information as a field of study is so new, one should not expect to soon see definitions of the subject relevant to historians. Instead, let definitions remain sloppy and ambiguous until such time as enough historical research has been done on the topic to suggest one or more clear delineations. We do not know enough about what infor- mation is, or its historical role, to be as absolute about its definition as physical or social scientists would like. As in many disciplines, ambiguity fosters innovative research, results, and consequences. Not all scholars would agree with this view. Alistair Black, who has written extensively about the scope of information history, has argued that "for any body of knowledge or field of expert practice to claim disciplinary status, it must be able to summon up a history."36 He is understandably impatient for certainty. Most students of information history would not have a problem with his position; however, we are left in the circumstance that the subject has not yet matured to that level of precision. This lack of development brings us back to the problem of carts before horses, because if Black's desire is to be achieved, we must recognize that an intellectual infrastructure has to be built that does not exist today but will exist "tomorrow." Questioning the validity</page><page sequence="10">1 28 I&amp;C/ Shaping Information History of information history as either a term or subfield may not be produc- tive for historians today, because too many disciplines recognize the potential importance of the topic and thus will engage in the shaping of this subject with or without the help of historians. They will do so because, to paraphrase World War I-era French prime minister Georges Clemenceau, "the subject is too important to leave to the historians," just as computer scientists in the 1950s and 1960s could not leave the structuring of information management to librarians.37 Let historians engage with the notion of information history as they develop their narratives of past uses of information. The history of li- braries suggests that information is what appears in manuscripts and publications and increasingly in libraries and museums. A nineteenth- century blacksmith might tell us that information is what his father taught him about how to make horseshoes or metal plows, while a fifteenth-century European doctor might argue that information is the insight of God drawn from Catholic texts. Van Doren, Mahoney, and Gleick vary in their descriptions of the features of information. Van Doren is inclined to see it as knowledge and insight, while the latter two scholars define it more as a mathematical conversation, with Gleick also including electronic impulses passing through DNA as part of the infor- mation domain.38 Recently, two observers of the information technology scene have written that information is part of a global data or knowledge network that may in time be the superior intelligence on earth. One of them, Kevin Kelly, even sees humans as the repository of information on behalf of this grander existence he calls technology, which we can analo- gize as making the human race play the role of a stack of universal index cards, books, or some loosely connected social-neural-digital-biological- anthropomorphic repository.39 Several years before these observations, a leading commentator on the transformation of information technology saw the evolution of humans and machines into a unified amalgam as an information entity.40 Historians have yet to catch up with these vari- ous lines of thinking, let alone to document what academic disciplines and users of information think are the definitions. That is why cement- ing an effective definition is impractical, if not impossible, at this time. Five Questions to Address First, Now If we cannot yet define information, we are left with the other two problems. What questions should historians ask first? What are they to do? There are several (I propose five) questions that appear sensible at</page><page sequence="11">129 the moment because they can be pursued and, increasingly, answered. They rest on the idea that "you know [information] when you see it." One can ask different questions, certainly, but we must begin, or con- tinue from, somewhere. These do not have to be asked in any particular order; in fact, diversity of investigation is actually an effective way for historians to collectively create a mosaic of events and human behavior. 1. What vessels were used to collect and store information in many different societies and times? This is the notion of the history of the book as originally conceived by a leading member of the French Annales school of history, Lucien Febvre, when he and others counted how many books were printed in Europe, where, on what topics, where the books were sold and to whom, and how they diffused.41 However, we expand the dialogue if we accept the idea that, as we moved closer to the twentieth century, paper ephem- era were not the only vessels used, just as earlier clay tablets were not the only information delivery mechanism of their day. In the nineteenth century, electricity complicated matters, first by making telegraphy available, then the telephone, radio, television, analog (later digital) measuring devices such as meters and sensors, and, of course, comput- ers. In fact, there are more devices creating, sending, and analyzing information over the Internet than there are human users. Forecasters routinely hold that by between 2011 and 2015 there will be more ma- chines working with information on the Internet than people on earth. So while historians have been writing histories of books and magazines for a long time, their work in the history of information has just begun.42 A similar logic also applies to other vessels such as schools, universities, libraries, industrial research centers, publishers, scholarly communities (tangible and virtual), and government agencies.43 In the process, let us not accept the narrow definition that "informa- tion is a thing," as has been proposed by some scholars, for the very simple reason that we know the topic is far more complex, involving nuances such as social behavior, institutional histories, economic con- sequences, and political outcomes.44 We have spaces to fill in human behavior and thinking, yet objects including books and DVDs are tan- gible conduits of information and influence about how people behave and do things, so they remain worthy of study. The challenge is to avoid exuberance, often in evidence when commentators refer to our time as the Information Age or the Age of Computers. I have explored</page><page sequence="12">1 30 I&amp;C/ Shaping Information History elsewhere that issue and the role of information technologies in shaping our understanding of the past and so would caution us to avoid overstat- ing a point of view about information history.45 2. By profession, job, or other human activity, what information was collected, used, and shared? Three parts exist to this question. It builds on the progress made in the twentieth century in understanding feedback loops, thanks to work in biology, cybernetics, artificial intelligence, and computer science.46 Historians have started to work on this question, although they continue to be drowned out by the voices of other interested parties focused on related themes, much as librarians when they were subsumed by com- puter scientists in the 1950s and 1960s.47 Answering this question lies at the heart of what historians do because, to fill in the details, they have to reconstruct the activities of thousands, if not millions, of people, each a unique experience. There was a time when issues were clearer - for example, when some library historians thought they understood exactly what library history was about and that it had little to do with informa- tion history. On the other hand, scholars now working in many other fields think that information history is important, that it should be stud- ied by historians of library history, and, most important, that the history of information has as an important component the role of those institu- tions most responsible for its dissemination such as libraries, publishers, booksellers, and schools. Addressing this question can represent a lion's share of the work on information history for decades to come. 3. What were the patterns of adoption and the use of information over time? Finding an answer to this question may require answering the previ- ous question situated in the context of individual years and centuries and in many geographies and places. Pilgrims in seventeenth-century New England used information differently than South Korean youth in the early twenty-first century. Pilgrims had the notion of avatars in the form of ideal Christian behaviors and types of people, while South Koreans imagine themselves as avatars in animated forms on the Internet; the former found their likenesses via the Bible, the latter via broadband Internet access. Both found the use of information central to their work, to their leisure time activities, and in defining themselves. We can accept as a working hypothesis that information is central to</page><page sequence="13">131 these three aspects of human activity - work, leisure, and identity - and is worth proving and describing through historical methods. Given enough examples, one can then begin to identify patterns of informa- tion use. Examples exist that can be ported over to the history of informa- tion. The oldest of these, of course, are the descriptions of the rise and fall of civilizations made so popular originally by Edward Gibbon in describing the decline of the Roman Empire (he famously attributed it to lead piping to some extent, yet one could just as easily have criti- cized the role of asymmetric flows of information) and Arnold Toynbee in the early twentieth century, who kicked off decades of discussions about patterns of rise and fall. But it continues.48 Timothy H. Parsons, in examining various empires, argued that such empires rose based on temporary advantages that one party had over another in military technologies, wealth, and political power, all of which required explicit bodies of information.49 Another historian, Ian Morris, described long- term patterns of why Western societies - namely, Europe and North America - dominated global events, identifying arrangements of effects, largely geographic, much as was argued by Jared Diamond in his exami- nation of what caused societies to thrive and fail.50 Recently, Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, two economists, discussed the role of information in combination with other patterns of behavior to explain major financial crises over the past eight hundred years, building, in the process, a typology of financial problems that one could use to explain repeated common behaviors over time.51 More specific to the history of information, we also have the example of Joel Mokyr, who has written on the "knowledge economy," using a label in wide use among economists.52 In this latter instance, knowledge and information are partially interchangeable, and Mokyr covers many centuries. An earlier study of his on the role of technology, which he likened to a lever that facilitated the creation of wealth in the Western world, was also about information - in this instance, technological and economic themes.53 These themes have also been discussed by Daniel Headrick in three books, all of which consciously dealt with informa- tion. The first, The Tools of Empire (1981), described how the acquisition of information about technology and its use facilitated the growth of European imperialism in the 1800s. In The Invisible Weapon (1991) he discussed the role of telecommunications in international affairs from 1851 to 1945, and, finally, he published an excellent example of a study on how Europeans organized information from 1700 to 1850 in When Information Came of Age (2000). 54</page><page sequence="14">1 32 I&amp;C/ Shaping Information History 4 . How did the use of information affect the work and lives of specific individuals and then of groups (e.g., a society)? Sociologist Harley Shaiken offered an example from the world of computing when he became an early student of work affected by in- formation technology-enabled automation.55 He examined the tasks performed by manufacturing workers, and generations of sociologists followed his lead, but Shaiken provided a meaningful model. He com- bined knowledge and practices in his descriptions of how work changed. In a similar vein, a groundbreaking historical study may be found in the scholarship of historian Richard Gillespie as he describes the Hawthorne experiments, appropriately titled Manufactuńng Knowledge ,56 MIT his- torian JoAnne Yates could reasonably argue that communications was a key element of the role of information, and she also looked at the history of its use in American corporations.57 I was already sensitive to the role of information when I wrote The Digital Hand , which looked at the history of the use of information technology in nearly three dozen industries, although I rarely used the term "information" as much as I did "processes," which, in modern management practice, included a healthy dose of information usage and management.58 These various approaches to historical research suggest that infor- mation history may be as much a perspective as a topic. By taking a process-centric view of knowledge work in The Digital Hand , for exam- ple, I was led to relegate information to a lesser role in favor of other questions, such as how information technologies affected the work and economic behavior of whole industries. That approach involved trade-offs. For example, it meant spending less time describing what in- formation - data - was gathered and its intrinsic forms or the cognitive or intellectual effect it had on people's behavior, let alone effects in cre- ating community within firms and industries. In exchange, I was able to highlight the importance of industries in the economy and demonstrate that it was possible to identify personalities of industries and patterns of their behavior as large ecosystems of social and economic communities. That was a prize worth pursuing from the perspective of either eco- nomic or business history, and to that end information history played an important, albeit supporting, role. Other historians have confronted trade-offs when situating the role of information in some larger story, an issue evident in many historical eras.59 One other important finding, however, was the significance of focusing on the spread of information's use in society: what was deployed, how much of it, how fast, to whom, when, and why.</page><page sequence="15">133 That is why tied to this fourth question should be an examination of the diffusion of information, an issue closely linked to several of the other questions raised in this article. Richard D. Brown provided an influential approach to the matter when he looked at how information flowed through North America from 1700 to 1865 by examining specific professions and how they acquired and used such material.60 These are themes also addressed by a new generation of researchers who have looked at the role of institutions such as those of the post office, tele- phone companies, and other communications technologies and, more recently, how information technology spread around the world. In all these cases, information's artifacts were instruments for the diffusion of information.61 This approach to the study of information is still not a well-developed aspect of historical investigation, but it holds great promise in our hunt for information history. 5. Finally , and at the risk of being premature in asking , what other historical discourses should be viewed as information history? An obvious example of this dilemma is the history of the clock. For several hundred years discussions about its history centered around the artifact itself, specifically its technologies, who made them, and so forth. Then historian David Landes wrote Revolution in Time: Clocks and the Making of the Modern World (1983), forever changing how the clock was studied because he argued that more important than the artifact was how it affected people: it put them on a schedule for work and play that depended less on the rising and setting of the sun and more on the in- formation provided by the device.62 Landes did for clocks what Elizabeth Eisenstein did for printing presses when she argued that the availability of so much printed information changed the politics and form of early modern European society forever.63 A Way Forward These five questions represent a big agenda that can serve two pur- poses. The first is to focus a floodlight on the topic itself, making it visible and acknowledging its presence to the wider community of histo- rians. The fact that so many people in various disciplines and subfields are commenting on the history of information is a normal development for a new subject area, in this case, for history. It is also testimony that few historians have yet waded into these waters in a comprehensive man- ner; scholars seem to be dipping their big toes into a large lake.64 The</page><page sequence="16">1 34 I&amp;C/ Shaping Information History second purpose is to provide a path forward to inform historians about what to examine and, indeed, how to deal with the subject. Unlike the problem faced by Mahoney in advising fellow historians about how to study the history of software, the topic of information history has been sufficiently nibbled at by enough skilled historians to suggest what to do next. Several approaches can be taken that worked for other fields of history such as military, diplomatic, economic, and social areas of study. The proposed approaches described below are also an acknowledgment that coordinating the work of historians is like attempting to herd cats: it cannot be done. Each will want to pursue lines of research of interest to him or her. However, they may be united by common investigatory practices and by telling stories of prior events and circumstances. That is good enough to do great work. First, document practices. The study of the role of literate professions has a long history covering lawyers, teachers, government officials, and priests and ministers, among others, across many centuries. Information historians should extend this line of investigation to other professions. The starting-off point for modern studies of professions and, hence, the information that buttresses them continues to be in the work of Andrew Abbott, the sociologist who suggested that professions were composed of experts and that their expertise could be described and understood.65 How people went about their work says a great deal about the informa- tion they needed and how they acquired it. Too many professions remain unstudied in their use of information (or knowledge), particularly those that were not considered literate, such as blacksmithing, farming, and soldiering, before World War II. Yet, in each case, one can probe and find a knowledge base, transmitted either orally, through written text, or through some combination of the two. There are many hundreds of professions to examine across several thousand years in some two hun- dred countries. Even in modern times, not all information is acquired through the printed word. A survey done of senior executives by busi- ness school professors in the early 1990s documented, for example, how little information the executives gathered from printed sources; rather, they learned and gained information by talking with people whom they trusted.66 Reijo Savolainen has done more than anyone in recent times to argue the case that noninstitutional distribution of information, such as conversations with friends, neighbors, and colleagues, is much more important than institutional sources, suggesting even further the need to account for everyday information-sharing practices.67 The same type of stiidy should be done to explore how whole in- stitutions learn and work, because there are information flows to be understood. In business enterprises and public institutions over the past</page><page sequence="17">135 several hundred years, the paper trail is impressive, as technology histo- rian Daniel R. Headrick demonstrated and as I found when looking at industries. The institutional approach has been studied more by econo- mists than social scientists and most thoroughly in the United States by economist Fritz Machlup and his colleagues.68 Communities of practice represent groups who share common interests and play important roles in promoting the uses of certain in- formation technologies and practices, all of which rely on significant bodies of information. Historians of information technology have re- cently begun to probe the work of these groups. For example, scholar Nathan Ensmenger has looked at the activities of early computer pro- grammers, advocating for the value of their work and the information tools they relied upon and suggesting a path forward for other infor- mation-laden professions.69 Walter Friedman examined the rise of the professional salesman in the twentieth century, which was influenced by formal training and other acts of professionalization of the workforce.70 Olivier Zunz took a different approach by describing roles and corpo- rations together, in effect as an ecosystem of activities.71 Yet another technique applied to the explanation of what practices took place can be found in Lars Heide 's study of early uses of computational devices for such applications as census taking in the first half of the twentieth century, where Heide compared organized activities from one country to another.72 Some communities have long been exemplars of how information is used and deployed and can provide models for future investigations. For example, historians of libraries have played an important role in describing the accumulation and use of information through institu- tional histories. While tensions have existed between scholars of "the book" and those of "the library," social historians have taught us that this is not an either-or situation; rather, each can interact with the other. Without the book, libraries would not have had as much purpose; with- out libraries, books may not have been so important to societies around the world. Both types of history have much to teach each other. Related to these two important pillars of information history is a third that is in need of further exploration: the bookseller. The late José Porter, arguably Spain's leading bookseller of the twentieth century, used to remind historians of the importance of his profession in disseminating information's artifacts to libraries and scholars and in getting maps and pamphlets into books and collections of manuscripts.73 Second, understand the context in which information and its use took place in roles , institutions , societies , and other circumstances. This admonition is what justifies the work of historians for many outside their profession.</page><page sequence="18">1 36 I&amp;C/ Shaping Information History Telling the story of what possibly happened can be entertaining, but understanding why people were doing things, the environment in which they worked, and, most important for our purposes, what they knew speaks to the crucial issue of agency in action, the "why" of history. No field of history can avoid context, and nowhere does that seem to be more the case than in the history of information, because, often, con- text is about what someone knew or believed was happening, on the one hand, and what historians argue was occurring, on the other. The history of information presents several opportunities to understand the role of context itself. Three opportunities come quickly to mind that warrant investigation. The study of abstract types of knowledge work such as programming and software engineering has taught us much about understanding what the protagonists knew before working in their new field. Having grown up as radio operators, electrical engineers, or mathematicians, for exam- ple, affected their views of the design and approaches to their work.74 This is a type of intellectual path dependency that can prove useful in the study of how individuals used information or how types of informa- tion were developed and evolved. Explaining how a body of knowledge was acquired and what people knew has long been standard fare in biographies, but codifying that for classes of workers is rarely done. For example, graduates of the Spanish military academies in the late 1800s and early 1900s learned different things from their counterparts in French and German military academies, with the result that, thirty years later, the generals in command of Spanish, French, and German military forces did not have as much of a shared worldview as one might think.75 In the late twentieth century, however, they did, thanks to their shared experiences as part of NATO as well as similarities in training at the American war colleges that many attended.76 Simultaneously, people were also influenced by the events and at- titudes accumulated as they practiced their profession, leading them to think about past events and their meaning. Michael Mahoney illus- trated this form of intellectual path dependency, for example, in his study of software engineers and how they misappropriated the notion of the Ford production line metaphor to inform their own practices.77 Memoirs, of course, are the quintessential example of this process put on display by individual agents, providing the kind of evidence, long valued by historians, documenting a person's changing views and skills over time. A second opportunity for study involves examining the values and ex- periences of generations of workers and how those affected the scope of information: what there was in a particular time and what was used.</page><page sequence="19">137 For example, westerners who lived through the economic inflation in Germany in the 1920s or the economic depression of the 1930s in Europe and the United States spent the rest of their lives worrying about financial security, and that concern influenced profoundly what they learned, the careers they had, and the subjects of interest to them.78 On the other hand, Chinese citizens in those two decades lived during a period of civil war and military occupation by Japan in parts of their country and with a national economy so impoverished that the pan- Atlantic's Great Depression would appear benign in comparison.79 So what were the contextual influences on each society affecting what in- formation existed and how it was used? Drawing a practice from the study of economic and business history is a third contextual approach one can take. It involves the notion of supply and demand, treating information almost as a product, a com- modity, or an asset. On the supply side is the notion of what information is being created and why - the contextual agents - and on the demand side how it is received and used and the consequences experienced. Such approaches begin to impose on the history of information some of the formal models that Abbott applied to professions, but this time they are applied to institutions such as industries, companies, military forces, and government agencies. Third, , "do history. " Much of what has been studied and written about the role of information has been conducted by scholars and pundits in every discipline. The carefully documented case studies and analyses of extant evidence that are the hallmarks of good historical practice can enrich society's understanding of the topic, not just other historians' study of information history. Biographies, for instance, were organized and influenced by geographic realities and the existence of institutions that could create and distribute information. These are all the bread- and-butter of what historians do well. It is in dealing with the ill-defined, the ambiguous, and what always seem to be unique situations that make it possible for historians to make important contributions to a topic. That ability clearly draws the attention of people in advanced and many developing economies at a time when all professions are information- intense in countries with the highest economic standards of living and more than a billion literate people are moving rapidly into the middle class in emerging economies.80 Supportive, supply-side actions are required, however, to facilitate the work of historians. First, let's honor the work of so many who have migrated toward naming this subfield "information history" - Black and Weiler, for example - by not debating what to call it, or how to define it, at least for the time being; there will be time to do that when we know</page><page sequence="20">1 38 I&amp;C/ Shaping Information History more. Second, this journal can lead by playing a leadership role in pro- moting and publishing on information history, including case studies, historiographical discussions, news of collections and events related to the theme, and reviews of books. Third, we may need a historical society to create a community around the topic, to hold conferences, and to fa- cilitate funding of research, much as the diplomatic historians, business historians, and others have their associations and organizations for the history of various technologies and fields of science. These last two rec- ommendations are proven ways to nurture the emergence of a subfield. Meanwhile, there is much work to be done by historians. Each of these activities can help address a fundamental problem underlying the discussion about information history: the need to link together researchers in multiple fields who could then learn from one another and, in the process, fill gaps in our knowledge in unexplored topics and the issues that lie between them, those empty lots in an intel- lectual neighborhood, along the lines that Alistair Black proposed when he spoke of "the history of contiguous areas."81 The field of information history needs shaping, and its definition needs further clarification for an age when many scholars in various dis- ciplines are as keen to understand the role of information in society as are people and institutions from all walks of life. Five questions and three strategies have been offered as a way to move from ambiguity to specific actions, from disparate scholarship to purposeful insights rele- vant for our times. Hopefully, we can avoid the problem of putting carts before horses as we see the flowering of an important subfield of history. Notes 1. Artificial intelligence has been the subject of some historical research, with one of the first serious histories being that of Howard Gordon, The Mind's New Science: A History of the Cognitive Revolution (New York: Basic Books, 1985), but with an earlier study, now a classic on the subject, written by Pamela McCorduck, Machines Who Think (San Francisco, CA: W. H. Freeman, 1979). The debate librarians had in the 1950s and 1960s on databases and organization of information awaits its historian; however, presentations by librarians appear in proceedings of various academic and industrial organizations all through the period. The diminishing voice of librarians in the face of growing volumes of commentary about all manner of information issues by people in other disci- plines and professions has yet to find its historian. 2.

The concept of "Big Data" has recently taken hold in government and in the private sector and refers to the large sets of digitized collections of information owned by large institutions. Such "data sets" can include a nation's census records and the sta- tistical information about a nation's economy such as labor, unemployment, and manufacturing inventories. These are complicated to manage and maintain, let alone to "mine" for insights, hence the term "Big Data" as an umbrella label for all these related issues. 10.
