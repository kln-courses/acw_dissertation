ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT CODE OF ETHICS INTRODUCTION The "Academy of Management (AOM) Code of Ethics" sets forth (1) principles that underlie the professional responsibilities and conduct of the AOM's membership and (2) enforced ethical stan dards that apply to members in official AOM roles and to those participating in AOM-sponsored activ ities. The principles are guidelines for everyday professional activities. They constitute normative statements for academicians, researchers, and man agers and provide guidance on issues that AOM members may encounter in their professional work. The enforced ethical standards are standards that individuals must adhere to when participating in and carrying out the work of the Academy of Man agement. Although not enforced outside of the Academy, these standards may also be viewed as guides for positive professional practice. Nonmem bers who participate in AOM activities (e.g., au thors, job seekers, etc.) also agree to adhere to the enforced ethical standards and to abide by the rules and policies pertaining to the specific AOM activ ities they engage in. AOM's "Code of Ethics" consists of these sec tions: Introduction, Preamble, General Principles, Professional Principles, and Ethical Standards. A separate document, the "Academy of Management Code of Ethics Policies and Procedures for Han dling Charges of Ethical Standards Violations," ac companies the "Code of Ethics." The Preamble, General Principles, and Profes sional Principles set forth aspirational goals to guide AOM members toward the highest ideals of research, teaching, practice, and service. Although these goals are not enforceable, AOM members should consider them in seeking to arrive at ethical courses of action. The Ethical Standards set forth enforceable rules for conduct by AOM members.1 Most of the Ethical Standards are written broadly in order to apply to members in varied roles and activities, and the application of an Ethical Standard may vary de pending on the Academy context. The Ethical Stan dards are not exhaustive. General rules of partici pation also exist at various levels in the Academy (e.g., program submission, manuscript submission, placement, governance activities, etc.). Conduct that this "Code of Ethics" does not specifically ad dress is not necessarily ethical or unethical. Membership in the AOM commits members to uphold the principles of the "AOM Code of Ethics" and to adhere to the enforced ethical standards and the accompanying policies and procedures. Mem bers are advised of this obligation upon joining the Academy of Management. Violations of the ethical standards may lead to the imposition of sanctions, including termination of membership. PREAMBLE The Academy of Management is devoted to in creasing scientific and professional knowledge of management practices. It promotes the use of such knowledge to improve the work lives of individu als, the efficiency and effectiveness of organiza tions, and the well-being of society as a whole. The AOM ensures that attention is paid to the rights and well-being of all organizational stakeholders. AOM members respect and protect civil and hu man rights and the central importance of freedom of inquiry and expression in research, teaching, and publication. They seek to help managers, em ployers, and public officials develop informed judgments and choices concerning the impact of business practices on individual employees and society, both nationally and globally. In doing so, AOM members perform many roles, acting as re searchers, teachers, consultants, diagnosticians, su pervisors, administrators, commentators, and so cial interventionists. AOM members realize that to maintain ethical standards they must make a per sonal, lifelong commitment to behaving ethically themselves; to encouraging students, supervisees, employees, employers, and colleagues to behave ethically; and to consulting with others when eth ical questions arise. GENERAL PRINCIPLES These general principles are aspirations and serve as a guide for AOM members in determining ethical courses of action in various contexts. They exemplify the highest ideals of professional con duct and are intended to challenge members to the highest ethical ideals of the profession. a"AOM member(s)" generally refers to members of the Academy of Management as well as to nonmembers par ticipating in AOM activities. 1270</page><page sequence="2">2006 Academy of Management Code of Ethics 1271 1. Responsibility AOM members establish relationships of trust with those with whom they work (students, col leagues, administrators, clients). They are aware of their professional and scientific responsibilities to society and to the specific communities in which they work. AOM members uphold professional standards of conduct, clarify their professional roles and obligations, accept appropriate responsi bility for their behavior, and seek to manage con flicts of interest that could lead to exploitation or harm. They are concerned about the ethicality of their colleagues' scientific, educational, and profes sional conduct. They strive to contribute portions of their professional time for little or no compen sation or personal advantage. 2. Integrity AOM members seek to promote accuracy, hon esty, and truthfulness in the science, teaching, and practice of their profession. In these activities AOM members do not steal, cheat, or engage in fraud, subterfuge, or intentional misrepresentation of fact. They strive to keep their promises, to avoid unwise or unclear commitments, and to reach for excel lence in teaching, scholarship, and practice. They treat students, colleagues, research subjects, and clients with respect, dignity, fairness, and caring. They accurately and fairly represent their areas and degrees of expertise. 3. Respect for People's Rights and Dignity AOM members respect the dignity and worth of all people and the rights of individuals to privacy, confidentiality, and self-determination. AOM members are aware of and respect cultural, individ ual, and role differences, including those based on age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, na tional origin, religion, sexual orientation, disabil ity, language, and socioeconomic status, and they consider these factors when working with all peo ple. AOM members try to eliminate the effect on their work of biases based on these factors, and they do not knowingly participate in or condone activi ties of others based upon such prejudices. The AOM and its members are also committed to pro viding academic and professional work environ ments that are free of sexual harassment and all forms of sexual intimidation and exploitation. PROFESSIONAL PRINCIPLES Our professional goals are to enhance the learn ing of students and colleagues and the effectiveness of organizations through our teaching, research, and practice of management. We have five major responsibilities: 1. To our students. Relationships with students require respect, fairness, and caring, along with commitment to our subject matter and to teaching excellence. We accomplish these aims by: Striving for teaching excellence. It is the duty of AOM members who are educators to maintain current knowledge of their fields; to devote suf ficient time to preparation, classroom communi cation, and timely grading; and to sensitize stu dents to the ethical dimensions of management. Showing respect for students. It is the duty of AOM members who are educators to show ap propriate respect for students' feelings, interests, needs, contributions, intellectual freedom, and rights to privacy. Maintaining objectivity and fairness. It is the duty of AOM members who are educators to treat students equitably. Impartiality, objectivity, and fairness are required in all dealings with students. Counseling students. It is the duty of AOM mem bers to be helpful and sensitive in counseling students. 2. To the advancement of managerial knowl edge. Prudence in research design, human subject use, and confidentiality and reporting of results is essential. Proper attribution of work is a necessity. We accomplish these aims through: Conducting and reporting. It is the duty of AOM members conducting research to design, imple ment, analyze, report, and present their findings rigorously. Planning and implementation. It is the duty of AOM members to minimize the possibility that results will be misleading and, when possible, to consult with experts or authoritative bodies on the ethics of research if a practice is unclear. Participants. It is the duty of AOM members to preserve and protect the privacy, dignity, well being, and freedom of research participants. Dissemination. It is the duty of journal editors and reviewers to exercise the privilege of their positions in a confidential, unbiased, prompt, constructive, and sensitive manner. Grants and contracts. It is the duty of AOM mem bers to represent themselves and their proposed</page><page sequence="3">1272 Academy of Management Journal December projects accurately, and to manage those projects as promised. 3. To the Academy of Management and the larger professional environment. Support of the AOM's mission and objectives, service to the AOM and its institutions, and recognition of the dignity and personal worth of colleagues are required. We accomplish these aims through: Sharing and dissemination of information. To encourage meaningful exchange, AOM members should foster a climate of free interchange and constructive criticism within the AOM and should be willing to share research findings and insights fully with other members. Academy participation. The AOM is a voluntary association whose existence and operations de pend on cooperation, involvement, and leader ship from its members. Commitment to professional standards of con duct. By this Code, the AOM provides ongoing ethical guidance for its members. Strengthening and renewal of the Academy. The AOM must have continuous infusions of mem bers and new points of view to remain viable and relevant as a professional association. Membership in the professional community. It is the duty of AOM members to interact with others in our community in a manner that recognizes individual dignity and merit. 4. To both managers and the practice of man agement. Exchange of ideas and information be tween the academic and organizational communi ties is essential. Consulting with client organizations ("clients") has potential for enriching the teaching and practice of management, for trans lating theory into practice, and for furthering re search and community service. To maximize such potential benefits, it is essential that members who consult be guided by the ideals of competence, integrity, and objectivity. We accomplish these aims through: Credentials and capabilities. It is the duty of consultants to represent their credentials and ca pabilities in an accurate and objective manner. Obligations to clients. Consultants have a duty to fulfill their obligations to their present and pro spective clients in a professionally responsible and timely manner. Client relations. Consultants must fulfill duties of confidentiality and efficiency as part of their relationships with their clients. Remuneration. It is the duty of consultants to negotiate clear and mutually accepted remuner ation agreements for their services. Societal responsibilities. Consultants have a duty to uphold the legal and moral obligations of the society in which they function. Consultants should report to the appropriate authorities any unlawful activities that may have been uncov ered during the course of their consulting en gagements (except where their functional or pro fessional codes direct otherwise). 5. To all people with whom we live and work in the world community. Sensitivity to other people, to diverse cultures, to the needs of the poor and disadvantaged, to ethical issues, and to newly emerging ethical dilemmas is required. We accom plish this aim through: Worldview. Academy members have a duty to consider their responsibilities to the world com munity. In their role as educators, members of the Academy can play a vital role in encouraging a broader horizon for decision making by view ing issues from a multiplicity of perspectives, including the perspectives of those who are the least advantaged. ETHICAL STANDARDS These are enforceable standards of conduct ap plying to members in official Academy roles and members and nonmembers participating in Acade my-sponsored activities. The Academy of Manage ment is an association whose existence and opera tions depend on cooperation, involvement, and leadership from its members. AOM members ad here to the highest ethical standards when interact ing with others in the association, participating in AOM activities, and assuming official roles. Mem bers also abide by the rules and policies pertaining to the specific AOM activities they engage in (e.g., program submission, division bylaws, board re quirements, etc.). 1. Human Relations 1.1. Unfair Discrimination: AOM members do not engage in unfair discrimination based on age, gender, gender identity, race, eth nicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, socioeco nomic status, or any basis proscribed by law. 1.2. Sexual Harassment: AOM members do not engage in sexual harassment. Sexual ha</page><page sequence="4">2006 Academy of Management Code of Ethics 1273 rassment is sexual solicitation, physical ad vances, or verbal or nonverbal conduct that is sexual in nature, occurs in connection with the member's Academy activities, and either: (1) is unwelcome, is offensive, or creates a hostile environment, and the member knows or is told this; or (2) is suf ficiently severe or intense as to be deemed abusive by a reasonable person in the con text. Sexual harassment can consist of a single intense or severe act or of multiple persistent or pervasive acts. 1.3. Other Harassment: AOM members do not knowingly engage in behavior that is ha rassing or demeaning to others with whom they interact, including behavior con ducted electronically (e.g., spamming, spoofing, mail-bombing, etc.). 1.4. Avoiding Harm: AOM members take rea sonable steps to avoid harming others with whom they interact and to minimize harm where it is foreseeable and unavoidable. 1.5. Conflicts of Interest: AOM members take appropriate steps to avoid conflicts of inter est or the appearance of conflicts. 1.5.1. Roles. AOM members refrain from assuming roles in which their inter ests or relationships could reason ably be expected to: (1) impair their objectivity, competence, or effective ness; or (2) expose the persons or organizations with whom the rela tionships exist to harm or exploitation. 1.5.2. Disclosure. AOM members disclose relevant information and personal or professional relationships that may have the appearance of or potential for a conflict of interest. 1.5.3. Decision making. AOM members carefully assess their potential for bias when making decisions affect ing those with whom they have had strong conflicts or disagreements. 1.6. Exploitative Relationships: AOM members do not exploit persons over whom they have evaluative or other authority, such as authors, job seekers, or student members. 1.7. Informed Consent: When AOM members conduct research, including on behalf of the AOM or its divisions, they obtain the informed consent of the individual or indi viduals, using language that is reasonably understandable to that person or persons. Written or oral consent, permission, and assent are documented appropriately. 1.8. Fiduciary Responsibility: 1.8.1. AOM best interests. Members in offi cial AOM roles (e.g., chairs, board members, division officers) act in a manner that is trustworthy and that inspires confidence that the mem bers are acting in the AOM's best interest. 1.8.2. Duty of accounting. Members who receive or handle AOM funds pro vide a true accounting of the money and/or property entrusted to them and do not cheat, steal, misappropri ate AOM resources, or circumvent AOM financial policies. 1.8.3. Personal gain. Members in official AOM roles do not receive compensa tion, gifts, or other special consider ation in return for the promise of AOM business. 2. Privacy and Confidentiality AOM members have an obligation to ensure the protection of confidential information. When gath ering confidential information, AOM members should take into account the long-term uses of the information, including its potential placement in public archives or the examination of the informa tion by others. 2.1. Maintaining Confidentiality: 2.1.1. AOM members take reasonable pre cautions to protect the confidential ity rights of others. 2.1.2. Confidential information is treated as such even if it lacks legal protec tion or privilege. 2.1.3. AOM members maintain the integ rity of confidential deliberations, ac tivities, or roles, including, where applicable, those of committees, re view panels, or advisory groups (e.g., the AOM Placement Committee, the AOM Ethics Adjudication Commit tee, etc.). 2.1.4. When using private information, AOM members protect the confiden tiality of individually identifiable in</page><page sequence="5">1274 Academy of Management Journal December formation. Information is private when an individual (e.g., an AOM scholarship applicant) can reason ably expect that the information will not be made public with personal identifiers. 2.2. Avoidance of Personal Gain: 2.2.1. Under all circumstances, AOM mem bers do not use or otherwise seek to gain from information or material re ceived in a confidential context (e.g., knowledge obtained from reviewing a manuscript or serving on a pro posal review panel), unless they have authorization to do so or that information is otherwise made pub licly available. 2.3. Limits of Confidentiality: 2.3.1. AOM members determine their abil ity to guarantee absolute confidenti ality at the outset and, as appropri ate, inform others of (1) the relevant limitations on confidentiality and (2) the foreseeable uses of the informa tion generated. 2.3.2. AOM members may confront unan ticipated circumstances where they become aware of information that is clearly threatening to others. In these cases, AOM members balance the importance of guarantees of confi dentiality with other principles in this "Code of Ethics," ethical con duct, and applicable law. 2.3.3. Confidentiality is not required with respect to observations in public places, activities conducted in pub lic, or other settings where no rules of privacy are provided by law or by custom. Similarly, confidentiality is not required in the case of informa tion available from public records. 2.4. Anticipation of Possible Uses of Information: 2.4.1. When maintaining or accessing per sonal identifiers in databases or sys tems of records, such as division ros ters, annual meeting submissions, or manuscript review systems, AOM members delete such identifiers be fore the information is made publicly available or employ other techniques that mask or control disclosure of in dividual identities. 2.4.2. When deletion of personal identifi ers is not feasible, AOM members take reasonable steps to determine that the appropriate consent of per sonally identifiable individuals has been obtained before they transfer such data to others or review such data collected by others. 2.5. Electronic Transmission of Confidential In formation: AOM members use extreme care in delivering or transferring any confiden tial data, information, or communication over public computer networks when con ducting AOM work. AOM members are at tentive to the problems of maintaining con fidentiality and control over sensitive material and data when the use of techno logical innovations, such as public com puter networks, may open their communi cation to unauthorized persons. 3. Public Statements 3.1. AOM members do not make public state ments, of any kind, that are false, deceptive, misleading, or fraudulent, either because of what they state, convey, or suggest or be cause of what they omit, including, but not limited to, false or deceptive statements concerning other AOM members. 3.2. When, at the request of the association, AOM members provide public comment on behalf of AOM, they take reasonable pre cautions to ensure that: (1) the statements are based on appropriate research, litera ture, and practice, (2) the AOM is credited, and (3) the statements are otherwise consis tent with this "Code of Ethics." 3.3. AOM members do not speak for or repre sent the AOM unless authorized by its pres ident to do so. 4. Research and Publication 4.1. Reporting on Research: AOM members ad here to the highest ethical standards when disseminating their research findings, such as at the annual meeting or in AOM publications. 4.1.1. AOM members do not fabricate data or falsify results in their publications or presentations.</page><page sequence="6">2006 Academy of Management Code of Ethics 1275 4.1.2. In presenting their work, AOM mem bers report their findings fully and do not omit data that are relevant within the context of the research question(s). They report results whether they support or contradict expected outcomes. 4.1.3. AOM members take particular care to present relevant qualifications to their research or to the findings and interpretations of their research. AOM members also disclose under lying assumptions, theories, meth ods, measures, and research designs that are relevant to the findings and interpretations of their work. 4.1.4. In keeping with the spirit of full dis closure of methods and analyses, once findings are publicly dissemi nated, AOM members permit their open assessment and verification by other responsible researchers, with appropriate safeguards, where appli cable, to protect the anonymity of re search participants. 4.1.5. If AOM members discover signifi cant errors in their publication or presentation of data, they take appro priate steps to correct such errors in the form of a correction, retraction, published erratum, or other public statement. 4.1.6. AOM members report sources of fi nancial support in their papers and note any special relations to any sponsor. AOM members may with hold the names of specific sponsors if they provide an adequate and full description of the sponsors' nature and interest. 4.1.7. AOM members report accurately the results of others' scholarship by us ing complete and correct information and citations when presenting the work of others. 4.1.8. AOM members who analyze data from others explicitly acknowledge the contribution of the initial researchers. 4.2. Publication Process: AOM members adhere to the highest ethical standards when par ticipating in publication and review processes. 4.2.1. Plagiarism 4.2.1.1. AOM members explicitly identify, credit, and refer ence the author of any data or material taken verbatim from written work, whether that work is published, un published, or electronically available. 4.2.1.2. AOM members explicitly cite others' work and ideas, including their own, even if the work or ideas are not quoted verbatim or para phrased. This standard ap plies whether the previous work is published, unpub lished, or electronically available. 4.2.2. Authorship Credit 4.2.2.1. AOM members ensure that authorship and other publi cation credits are based on the scientific or professional contributions of the individ uals involved. 4.2.2.2. AOM members take respon sibility and credit, including authorship credit, only for work they have actually per formed or to which they have contributed. 4.2.2.3. AOM members usually list a student as principal author on multiply authored publi cations that substantially de rive from the student's dis sertation or thesis. 4.2.3. Submission of Manuscripts for Publication 4.2.3.1. In cases of multiple author ship, AOM members confer with all other authors prior to submitting work for pub lication, and they establish mutually acceptable agree ments regarding submission. 4.2.3.2. In submitting a manuscript to an AOM publication, members grant that publica tion first claim to publica tion, except where explicit</page><page sequence="7">1276 Academy of Management Journal December policies allow multiple submissions. 4.2.3.3. It is AOM policy to permit the authors of manuscripts that have been previously published in any proceed ings to submit substantially embellished manuscripts for AOM journal review. 4.2.3.4. AOM members may not sub mit a manuscript to a second publication until after a de cision has been received from the first publication or until the authors have for mally withdrawn the manu script. AOM members sub mitting a manuscript for publication in a journal, book series, or edited book can withdraw a manuscript from consideration up until an official acceptance is made. 4.2.3.5. When AOM members pub lish data or findings that overlap with work they have previously published else where, they cite these publi cations. AOM members must also send the prior publication or in-press work to the AOM journal editor to whom they are submitting their work. 4.2.4. Responsibilities of Editors 4.2.4.1. When serving as editors of journals, books, or other publications, AOM mem bers are fair in the applica tion of academic publishing standards, and they operate without personal or ideolog ical favoritism or malice. As editors, AOM members are cognizant of any potential conflicts of interest. 4.2.4.2. When serving as editors of journals or book series, AOM members ensure the confidentiality of the review process and supervise edito rial office staff, including stu dents, in accordance with practices that maintain confidentiality. 4.2.4.3. When serving as editors of journals or book series, AOM members are bound to publish all manuscripts ac cepted for publication un less major errors or ethical violations are discovered af ter acceptance (e.g., plagia rism or scientific misconduct). 4.2.4.4. When serving as editors of journals or book series, AOM members ensure the anonymity of reviewers un less they receive permission from reviewers to reveal their identities. Editors en sure that their staff members conform to this practice. 4.2.4.5. When serving as journal ed itors, AOM members ensure the anonymity of authors unless and until a manu script is accepted for publi cation, or unless the estab lished practices of the journal are known to be otherwise. 4.2.4.6. When serving as journal edi tors, AOM members take steps to provide for the timely review of all manuscripts and respond promptly to inquir ies about the status of a review. 4.2.5. Responsibilities of Reviewers 4.2.5.1. In reviewing material sub mitted for publication or other evaluation purposes, AOM members respect the confidentiality of the pro cess and the proprietary rights of those who submit ted the material. 4.2.5.2. AOM members disclose con flicts of interest or decline requests to review others' work when they are aware of conflicts of interest. 4.2.5.3. AOM members decline re quests for reviews of the work of others when they believe that the review pro</page><page sequence="8">2006 Academy of Management Code of Ethics 1277 cess may be biased or when they have questions about the integrity of the process. 4.2.5.4. If asked to review a manu script, book, or proposal they have previously re viewed, AOM members make that prior review known to the person making the request (e.g., editor, pro gram officer), unless it is clear that they are being asked to provide a reappraisal. 5. Ascribing to the "Code of Ethics" Upon joining the AOM, members agree to up hold and promote the principles of the "AOM Code of Ethics" and to adhere to its enforced ethical standards. 5.1. Familiarity with the "Code of Ethics": AOM members have an obligation to be familiar with this "Code of Ethics." Lack of aware ness or misunderstanding of an ethical standard is not, in itself, a defense to a charge of unethical conduct. 5.2. Confronting Ethical Issues: 5.2.1. When AOM members are uncertain whether a particular situation or course of action might violate the "Code of Ethics," they may consult the AOM's Ethics Ombudsperson. 5.2.2. When AOM members confront tak ing actions or making choices entail ing conflict between ethical stan dards enunciated in the "Code of Ethics" and laws or legal require ments, they make known their com mitment to the "Code" and take steps to resolve the conflict in a responsi ble manner by consulting the AOM's Ethics Ombudsperson. 5.3. Fair Treatment of Parties in Ethical Disputes: 5.3.1. AOM members do not discriminate against a person on the basis of his or her having made an ethical com plaint or having been the subject of an ethical complaint. This consider ation does not preclude taking action based upon the outcome of an ethical complaint. 5.4. Reporting Ethical Violations of Others: When AOM members have substantial rea son to believe that there has been an ethical violation by another AOM member, they attempt to resolve the issue by bringing it to the attention of that individual. If an infor mal resolution appears appropriate or pos sible, or AOM members seek advice about how to proceed, they may contact the AOM's Ethics Ombudsperson for guidance. 5.5. Cooperating with Ethics Committees: AOM members cooperate in ethics investigations, proceedings, and resulting requirements of the AOM. In doing so, they make reason able efforts to resolve any issues of confi dentiality. Failure to cooperate may be an ethics violation. 5.6. Improper Complaints: AOM members do not file or encourage the filing of ethics complaints that are frivolous and are in tended to harm the alleged violator.</page><page sequence="9">?

STYLE GUIDE FOR AUTHORS This "Style Guide for Authors" covers the for mats to use when preparing manuscripts for the Academy of Management Journal (AMJ). A differ ent document, "Information for Contributors5' (front of each issue or http://aom.pace.edu/amj/ submission.html) describes desirable content. Manuscript Submission and Length Submit manuscripts electronically to the editor at amjtlee@u.washington.edu. Follow the "Instructions for Electronic Submission (http://aom.pace.edu/amj/ electronic.html). Articles should not ordinarily exceed 40 manu script pages, including references, appendixes, ta bles, and figures. Research notes should not ordi narily exceed 25 pages. Manuscript Format AMJ is not printed directly from your file but is typeset, so you do not need to imitate our journal's look. Instead, capture how manuscript elements should fit together by following this "Guide." Use at least 12-point type. Double-space every thing, including references, appendixes, tables, and figures. Use wide margins?an inch or more. Don't vary type size (stick with 12-point). Vary type style minimally. Do not underline; use your italics op tion. When you save, use the option "Embed true type symbols" on your pull-down "tools" menu, under "general options." Front Pages Number your title page "1." Under the title of your work, list authors' names, affiliations, and complete addresses and contact numbers. Example: AN EXCELLENT STUDY A. MANAGEMENT SCHOLAR Famous University Special Department Building and/or Street City, State, Zip Code Tel: (000) 000-0000 Fax: (000) 000-0000 e-mail: scholar@fam.edu The details of your address do not appear in AMJ, but we need them to keep in touch with you. Keep the editor's office informed about changes in your affiliation and about long absences like sabbaticals. To acknowledge financial support and/or the as sistance of others in your research, add a note at the bottom of page 1. An abstract of 75 words or less (and the title of the article) go on page 2. Back Pages Group references, appendixes, tables, and figures at the end of your submission. Continue your page numbering. Put hard page breaks between each of these parts of your manuscript and between each component. For instance, the references begin on a new page, and each table begins on its own page. Headings AMJ uses only three levels of headings. Main headings designate the major sections of an article or note; three or four main headings should be enough for most articles. Don't use an initial head ing like "Introduction." Center your main headings and type them in all capitals. Example: METHODS Second-level headings follow. Type these head ings flush with the left margin, beginning only ma jor words with capitals. Example: Data and Sample Indent third-level headings. Capitalize only the first letter and first letter after a colon and end the heading with a period and continue with your text. Example: Manager sample. Respondents consisted of a ran dom sample of 300 managers. . . First sample: Bank managers. Respondents con sisted. . . Sections Sections with main headings precede those with second-level headings, which precede those with third-level headings. Do not launch directly into second-level headings. When you divide a main section into second level sections, use two or more of the latter. When you divide a second-level section, use two or more sections with third-level headings. 1278</page><page sequence="10">2006 Volume 49, Number 6 1279 Second-level sections should be at least a page long. Hypotheses Set hypotheses off from your text. Fully and sep arately state each hypothesis you tested separately. Give it a distinct number or number-letter label. Example: Hypothesis la. Concise writing has a positive relationship to publication. Hypothesis lb. Following AM/'s "Style Guide for Authors" has a positive relationship to publication. Terminology Help your work to be accessible to AMJ's wide ranging readership. Define key technical terms, both conceptual and analytical ones. (A word that is not in a general-use dictionary or is not in such a dictionary with the meaning you ascribe to it is a technical term.) Quotes can replace defining for technical terms that are less important to your arguments. Avoid using abbreviations for the names of con cepts. Variable names should be ordinary words; do not use code names or other abbreviations. Use the same name for a variable whenever it appears in your text, tables, figures, and appendixes. Footnotes Avoid footnotes and endnotes. Keep them con cise when you use them. Math Do not "talk in math" in regular text. Use words. For instance, "We surveyed 100 employees," not "We sur veyed n = 100 employees." "We used chi-squares to evaluate coefficients," not "We used ^2s." Report statistical results in parentheses. Format these and equations as thoroughly as possible; use italics for symbols representing variables, bold ital ics for vectors, and Greek letters and other needed symbols. Not all equations need to be displayed. Sexist and Biased Language Avoid language that might be interpreted as den igrating to ethnic or other groups. Be particularly careful in dealing with gender, where long-estab lished customs, such as the use of "he" as a generic pronoun ("a manager . . . he"), can imply gender based discrimination. Using plural pronouns? changing "the manager . . . he" to "managers . . . they"?is preferred. Active Voice and First Person Put sentences in the active voice instead of the passive to make it easy for readers to see who did what. Use the first person ("I" or "we") to describe what you did: Two items were found to lack factor validity by Earley (1989). [Passive] Earley (1989) found that two items lacked factor validity. [Active] Three new items were developed. I developed three new items. Anthropomorphism Avoid describing inanimate entities as acting in ways only humans can act. Tables and Figures Useful tables and figures do not duplicate the text; they supplement and clarify it. Because tables and figures are more expensive to prepare for pub lication than text, please carefully consider what each adds to your work. For each table or figure, center "TABLE" or "FIG URE" with a number ("1", "2", etc.) at the top of the page. Put the title next, also centered at the top. Number tables and figures consecutively (one se ries for tables, one for figures). Group your tables and figures at the end of the manuscript as de scribed under "Back Pages" above. Indicate the po sition of each in the text as follows: Insert Table 2 about here Each table or figure should have a sentence in your text that introduces it. Tables Use more than one page if a table needs them?do not squeeze material onto one page. Each table should report one type of analysis, which is identified in the title. Each vertical column and horizontal row should have only one type of data. Label what you are presenting across the top or down the side?not in the body. Use ordinary words, not abbreviations, and avoid parentheses. Report only two decimal places for statistics. In</page><page sequence="11">1280 Academy of Management Journal December correlation matrixes, the correlations should fill the lower-left corner of the table. For general footnotes to tables, use superscript small letters. For significance levels, either summarize in a lettered footnote ("aAll values greater than ") or use this format: + p&lt; .10 * p &lt; .05 ** p &lt; .01 *** p &lt; .001 Note that each level goes on a separate line. Consult published issues of AMJ for models of tables. Figures Figures (unlike tables) have graphics. Our printer scans in figures directly from your manuscript. So make sure your figures will print out crisp and clear. Avoid "stacking"?write all words horizontally, not vertically. Use the same variable names you use in the text. Do not abbreviate. Look at figures in published AMJs for format ideas. Citations Citations are your in-text identifications of other research. Minimize self-citations that would reveal your manuscript's authorship. Doing this is impor tant for protecting the double-blind review process. To cite, enclose authors' names and the year of a work in parentheses. Example: Several studies (Adams, 1974; Brown &amp; Hales, 1975, 1980; Collins, 1976a, 1976b) support this conclusion. Order citations alphabetically. Two or more works by one author (or by an identical group of authors) published in the same year should have "a," "b," etc., added after the year. If a work has no human author(s), cite the peri odical it is in as the author: [Wall Street Journal, 1990) or cite the "corporate author" that produced it: "... forecasts of increasing service jobs in the U.S. Industrial Outlook (U.S. Department of Com merce, 1992)... To cite a direct quotation, give pages after the year, separated from it by a colon. Example: Adams has said that writing a book is "a long and arduous task" (1974: 3). Also cite page numbers when you paraphrase or summarize others' specific arguments or findings. If a work has two authors, give both names every time you cite it. For three through six authors, give all names the first time, then use "et al." Examples: Few field studies use random assignment (Foster, Whittington, Tucker, Horner, Hubbard, &amp; Grimm, 2000). (first citation) . . . even when random assignment is not possible (Foster et al., 2000). (subsequent citation) For seven or more authors, use "et al." even for the first citation. (But the matching reference should give all the authors.) References References are your entries in the alphabetical list at the end of your article or research note. This list includes only work you have cited. Alphabetize references by the last name of a sole author, a first author, or an editor, or by the name of a corporate author (for instance, U.S. Census Bureau) or periodical (such as the Wall Street Journal) if there is no human author or editor. Order works by an identical author by year of publication, listing the earliest first. If the years of publication are also the same, differen tiate entries by adding small letters ("a," "b," etc.) after the years. Repeat author name for each entry. Book entries follow this form: Authors' or Ed itors' Last Names, Initials. Year. Title of book. (Italic, lowercase except for the first letter of the first word and the first word after a long dash or colon). City Where Published, State or Country (if needed to identify the city; use U.S. Postal Ser vice abbreviations for states): Name of Publisher. Examples: Granovetter, M. S. 1965. Getting a job: A study of con tracts and careers. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Kahn, R. L., &amp; Boulding, E. (Eds.). 1964. Power and con flict in organizations. Glencoe, IL: Free Press.

Rynes, University of Iowa, USA; editor of the Academy of Management Journal Richard Whitley, University of Manchester, UK; author of The Intellectual and Social Organization of the Sciences About the Workshop: The Organization Studies Summer Workshop is an annual activity, launched in June 2005, to facilitate high-quality scholarship in organization studies. Its primary aim is to advance cutting-edge research on important topics in the field by bringing together, on a Greek island in early summer, a small and competitively selected group of scholars who will have the opportunity to interact and share insights in a stimulating and scenic environment. The Third Organization Studies Summer Workshop will take place at the Perle Hotel [http://www.perlespa.com), Chania, Crete, on 7 &amp; 8 June 2007. The Workshop will be limited to about 50 papers to ensure in-depth discussion. We welcome both theoretical and empirical papers that demonstrate rigorous analyses and approaches. Papers could consider, but are not restricted to, the following topics on the generation and use of academic knowledge about organisations: 1. Epistemological issues concerning what counts as valid knowledge (including aspects such as truth, objectivity vs. subjectivity, etc.); 2. Methodological issues about how valid knowledge is generated; 3. Praxeological issues about how valid knowledge is used in practice; 4. Sociological issues regarding the social settings in which academic knowledge is produced and the forms that knowledge traffic between academics and practitioners takes; and 5. Critical issues regarding the political nature of knowledge and the various interests that are served during the process of knowledge production and application (including aspects such as power, dependency, legiti macy, etc.); 6. Learning in terms of teaching management students; how and why understanding the relationship between knowledge production and consumption might inform our teaching practices. Special Issue of Organization Studies The Workshop will be followed by a Special Issue of Organization Studies on this topic, which will be published in 2009. Submissions Interested participants must submit to the Editor-in-Chief [OSeditor@alba.edu.gr) an abstract of no more than 1000 words for their proposed contribution plus a brief biographical note by January 31, 2007. The submission must be made via email and it must be a Word attachment.
