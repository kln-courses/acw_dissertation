<plain_text><page sequence="1">Buryat Chronicles as Historical Sources of Buryat Ethnicity: A Reconstruction of a Hierarchical Structure of Ethnic Identity DAR1MA BORONOYEVA ULAN-UDE The Buryats are a Mongolic-speaking people, one of the most numerous among native nationalities of Siberia and the Far East. They have been resident around Lake Baikal, and it is from this territory that the future Buryat people were formed, where they acquired the main features of their ethnic specificity, different from the rest of the Mongolian nations. As an example, we may cite the peculiar manner of pronunciation of the sound "h"1 (Nimaev 2000: 153). As is well known, a nation or ethnos during its period of formation is influenced most of all by its geographic environment; one may say that this ethnos "adapts itself to its natural niche." Very often the typical landscapes of an ethnic territory are "imprinted" on the consciousness of the people who inhabit that area and become a kind of symbol of ethnic belonging. Lake Baikal is certainly such a symbol for the Buryats, due to its appearance in their genealogie legends and traditions. We will not undertake here an in-depth analysis of the ancient and medieval history of the Baikal region. Let us just point out that a part of the territories inhabited by Buryats today were frontier lands called Bargujin-Tüküm 2 during the Mongol Empire period. Generally, relations between Mongols of the Three Rivers (i.e. the Qamuq Mongghol Ulus or "All-Mongol State") and the population of Bargujin-Tüküm3 were very close and family-like. For instance, the words quoted in the Compendium of Chronicles by Persian historian Rashid-ad-din are well known, wherein Chinggis Khan4 supposedly said during the period of his power: "Every boy born in Bargujin- Tüküm, by the Onon and Kerulen, will be courageous and brave,</page><page sequence="2">2 Mongolian Studies XXVIII (2006) clever and intelligent (by nature) without teaching and instructions. Every girl born there will be good looking and perfect without decoration, brushing ( mashat ) and rouge and will be extremely skillful, quick and well wishing." Traditionally, the Buryats were divided into four main units, which are conventionally considered to be tribes or tribal unions: they are the Khori, Bugalat, Ekhirit and Khongodor. According to most scholars studying the Buryats, separation from the Mongolian world and the incorporation of the Baikal region into Russia played a determining role in the consolidation of these tribes and the generation of a feeling of independence from other Mongolian nations. As is known, 1 659 is conventionally (but not officially) considered to be the year when the process of Buryatia's incorporation into Russia was complete. But at the same time territorial problems were obviously solved in 1689 after signing the Nerchinsk agreement, which defined Russia's eastern borders with China. The question of the southern borders was opened till the defining of the Russian-Mongolian frontier in 1727, when the Burinsk treaty (called after a place near Kyakhta) was signed. Since then, free migration of nomadic Mongolian-speaking populations in the Baikal region, Khalkh- Mongolia and Jungaría was over and Russian administration took total control of the local population, whose further ethnic development was influenced by Russian population.5 Since the frontier was defined, the general self-name "Buryats" began to spread, which ultimately determined the unity of ethnic self-consciousness ("I am Buryat"). Thus we admit that the creation of a state border was the key moment in the birth of Buryat ethnic identity and the appearance of a Buryat ethnic group.6 At the same time, one should mention the following: by stating the aforementioned, we do not mean to say that territorial state division meant the complete destruction of the traditional economic and cultural relations between the Buryats and other Mongolian people. General Statistical Data According to the 1989 census of the USSR there were 421,380 Buiyats, of which 417,425 lived in the Russian Federation (Natsional'nyi 1990). Most of these lived in the Republic of Buryatia (249,525), in the Irkutsk region (77,330 Buryats), of which 49,298 lived in the Ust'-Orda area, and in the Chita region (66,625), of which 42,362 lived in the Aga area. The rest of the Buryats lived in Russia's Yakutia, Magadan, Moscow, and Krasnoyarsk regions, Kazakhstan,</page><page sequence="3">Boronoyeva 3 and other places. The total number of Buryats living outside of the Republic of Buryatia is 40.2 percent. There is no administrative unit in which Buryats are the majority, except the Aga Autonomous Area, where 54.9 percent of the population is Buryat. In foreign countries, Buryats live compactly in the northeast of Mongolia, where, according to different sources, there are from thirty to one hundred thousand people (Badarsha 1996; Istorila 1999; Mikhailov 1994; Nimaev 1989; Nyambuu 1992; Khankharaev 1996). In China's Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region there are about six thousand people (Bodonggud 1985). The emigration of Buryats from Russia during the end of the 19th century until the 1930s resulted in the formation of these Buryat ethnic communities in Mongolia and in Inner Mongolia. As a result, the Buryats are a "divided" nation, living in Russia, China and Mongolia. At the same time, within Russia itself, the Buryats happen to live in three different administrative territorial units. These are the Buryat Republic, the Buryat National Autonomous Area of Ust'-Orda and the Buryat National Autonomous Area of Aga. In addition, some groups of Buryats live elsewhere (e.g. in the Olkhon and Kachug districts of Irkutsk, and the Khilok and Onon districts of Chita). The Republic of Buryatia with its capital of Ulan-Ude may be recognized as an integrative center of the Buryats. We quite agree with the distinguished researcher and ethnographer T.M. Mikhailov, who once wrote about the matter: "Living in different parts and regions of the country [the former USSR], still the Buryats did not break free running and looking for new lands, they did not turn into 'century roamers.' Most of them remained in the motherland and defended their home. We should mention that when we say 'home,' in fact we mean Buryat Republic with its center Ulan-Ude, because the national spirit is gathered here" ( Voprosy 1992: 8). There are twenty-one districts, six towns, and 29 townships in the Republic of Buryatia. The population of the republic was 1,059,400 persons in January 1992. They represented 12 different ethnic groups: Russians (726,200); Buryats (249,500); Ukrainians (22,900); Tatars (10,500); Evenkis (1,800), and so on. The capital of Buryatia is Ulan- Ude; its population is 367,500 people, 78,700 of them are Buryats. As is noted by many visitors to Buryatia, it is typical of the capital's citizens that ethnic Buryat residents very often use Russian language to talk to each other. That is to say, the use of the Buryat language has gradually declined as an ethnic identifier. Such a considerable growth</page><page sequence="4">4 Mongolian Studies XXVIII (2006) in the number of people whose ethnic origin and native language do not match is a sign of the progressive process of linguistic assimilation. According to 1994 statistics, 78.3 percent of Buryats living in Ulan-Ude identified the Buryat language as their native tongue, while the other 21.7 percent considered Russian to be their native one. Based on her research, the Buryat ethnologist I.E. Elaeva concluded that contemporary Buryats do not realize the importance of language as a component of ethnic identity, and therefore do not recognize the value of its preservation. During the interviews she conducted, it became clear that Buryats are united to their nationality by "culture, nature, and land," not by language. Even so, all the research of Buryat scholars shows that in reality language is the core of Buryat culture; misunderstanding of this fact promotes language assimilation. Indeed, according to some Buryat scholars, the factor of "openness" to external influence of the Buryat ethnos as an ethnic social system, and the factor of "tolerance," have played a decisive role in the general process of assimilation of the Buryats and the lose of their native language. As G.A. Dyrkheeva points out, unlike other people who have also had long-term contacts (and sometimes conflict) with neighboring nations, purism is not typical of Buryats, and they do not protect their cultural originality and native language (Dyrkheeva 2001: 61). Perhaps, this is evident in the fact that the Republic of Buryatia is traditionally considered to be one of the Russian regions with a low rate of conflict, including ethnic ones. According to the 1989 census, there are six regions out of twenty- one in the Republic of Buryatia where Buryats are the majority: Yeravna (50.4% Buryat), Zakamna (57.3%), Kizhinga (56.2%), Kurumkan (63.9%), Oka (90.7%), and Tunka (61.4%). Relatively high percentages of Buryats also live in Selenga (49.3%) and Dzhida (42.3%) regions. Lately, an ethnic-territorial division of the republic's rural population has taken place: distinctly Buryat and Russian villages have appeared, which is one of the characteristic features of the current socioeconomic crisis. In Buryatia the number of mixed marriages is steadily growing. According to O.V. Buraeva's research on Russian-Buryat cultural interaction, the percentage of mixed marriages from the eighteenth to twentieth centuries has been 10-12 percent, yet has grown in absolute numbers. In 1970, 15,097 mixed marriages were registered in Buryatia and in 1979, 19,804. It is expected that the new census of 2002 will show that the percentage of mixed marriages has increased</page><page sequence="5">Boronoyeva 5 to 25 percent. Long-term life together, active interaction in economic activities, and exchange in goods and cultural values between Russian and Buryats has resulted in the appearance of a considerable mixed population - the so called metis or karym. As interviews show, about fifty percent of the republic's citizens answered positively when asked if they had family ties with representatives of other nationalities (Karnyshev 1996). The Modern Ethnic Situation The policy of the Soviet state aimed at internationalization and creating a new community, the Soviet people, which resulted in the development of two intertwined phenomena-mutual penetration and enrichment of various nations' cultures, and at the same time an obvious process of mutual assimilation. Summarizing the Buryats' development in the Soviet period, one respected ethnographer writes that during this time contradictory processes took place: on the one hand was further consolidation, unprecedented cultural development,7 and development of the consciousness or mentality, but on the other hand the process of de-ethnicization and assimilation 8 began (Mikhailov 1996: 24; Mikhailov 1999a: 29-35). The logical consequence of these phenomena in the post-Soviet epoch (as in many other Russian national regions) was the way in which the ethnic factor played the most important role in social life. A Buryat national movement with the slogan of "national cultural renaissance" made a "new" idea of the Buryats, recollecting and sometimes even recreating the past. As a rule renaissance always turns to the past. In the past one can find the ideals, which nowadays are used as arguments for the desired choice of the revived cultural "components." In a situation of losing a continuity of traditions in Buryat society,9 they started discussing an urgent question of what exactly of Buryat cultural heritage was productive and necessary today (that question was posed to prevent the nation's renaissance from becoming simply archaic), and whether revived cultural components "conformed" to the historical realities of the Buryat past. Judging by some "key" episodes displaying ethnic essence, which took place during the last decade in ethnographic Buryatia, this renaissance is basically considered as revival of religion (Buddhism, shamanism) and the promotion of the Buryat language's status and prestige as an ethnic symbol. The latter is connected with the education system. In addition there are among the issues leading to ethnic mobilization some dealing with the consolidation of the "divided" Buryat nation, bringing back the name</page><page sequence="6">6 Mongolian Studies XXVIII (2006) "Buryat-Mongolian Republic," recollecting the names of outstanding Buryats and historical events in their deserved prominence. An analysis of the most important events and works of the major "ideologists" of the Buryat national movement allows us to identify the cognitive components of ethnic self-consciousness-the ideas that make up the image that "we are Buryats." In this respect, it is logical that in the 1990's S.B. Chimitdorzhiev wrote a book called "Who Are We, Buryat-Mongols?" We consider this work one of the signs of a "return" to common Mongolia-oriented development.10 In our view, on the ideological level of ethnic self-consciousness (formed by the Buryats' academic and creative intelligentsia) attention has focused on the paradigm "Buryat-Mongols." But as practice and concrete facts show, in the Buryat national environment a strikingly opposite level of integration-a tribal-territorial one-actually predominates." This misfortune of the modern stage of the Buryat national movement can probably be explained by a mismatch of the "ideological" and "ordinary" orientations of preferred levels of integration. While ideology is oriented ethnically to a pan-Mongolian level (Mongols, Buryat-Mongols), the people in ordinary life are oriented locally or territorially (the tribal-territorial community level). Thus, we believe that it is vital to study historical works, and the Buryat chronicles in particular, to comprehend the roots of the modern tendencies of self-identification and draw diachronic/historical parallels with the situation today. Our work on the Buryat chronicles is aimed at defining the traditional hierarchies of identity, determining the real and potentially available variants of ethnic identity with their appropriate cultural markers and distinctive symbols, as described therein. Buryat Chronicles as the Written Heritage of the Buryats The Buryat historical chronicles and genealogical trees are a valuable historical source. The ethnographic and linguistic details in the chronicles are also valuable. Buryat chronicles became a subject of scholarship not so long ago, to wit, since the mid-1 930s. Since then many prolific scholars, such as G.N. Rumyantsev, Ts.B. Tsydendambaev, S.P. Baldaev, D.D. Nimaev, S.B. Chimitdorzhiev, N. Poppe, and B. Rinchin have studied these chronicles. In particular, we must mention Ts.B. Tsydendambaev's contribution. He was the first to systemize and analyze thoroughly practically all known Buryat chronicles listed in the Russian and Mongolian archives (Tsydendambaev 2001). In addition, the aspects of the Buryat</page><page sequence="7">Boronoyeva 7 chronicles in which we are interested were studied by T.D. Skrynnikova (1999). Her methods in studying the Buryat chronicles, as well as the results of her research, have been used extensively in this study. The earliest historical chronicle composed among the Buryats now at our disposal is the Balzhan khatanai tuuzha "Story of Balzhin- khatun," which judging from its content, was written not earlier than 1727 and no later than 1760-1770. But the bulk of the Buryat chronicles were written during the nineteenth century and up to the beginning of the twentieth century. More than thirty independent chronicles are documented today. Some of them have been published and translated into Russian (and one into English), while some have been published in the modern Buryat script. These sources differ greatly in length, from a few pages to several dozen pages. The chronicles of V. Yumsunov and of S.N. Khobituev are the longest. The content of the Buryat chronicles was limited by their small territorial focus.13 Thus the Khori, Selenge, and Barguzin Buryats each had many chronicles. The reason is that among these Buryat groups Buddhism as well as the Mongolian writing were widespread (all the historical works of the pre-revolutionary Buryats were written in the traditional Mongolian script). For this reason, they were familiar with Mongolian chronicles and genealogies and in their structure and form the Buryat chronicles are like Mongolian ones. Yet at the same time, the Buryat chronicles have a more documentary character, especially when they describe events which took place after the Buryat's incorporation into the Russian Empire. About this "documentary" character of the Buryat chronicles, Ts. B. Tsydendambaev points out the following: In Buryat historical works the numbers and dates of the documents are given very accurately when they speak about allotting lands for Buryats to lead a nomadic life, about so-called patents for ranks and positions, and about any business orders from the authorities, etc. This peculiarity of the Buryat chronicles surprised those who studied them and after N. Poppe the following viewpoint was spread, viz. that the Buryat chroniclers referred to numbers of business documents in order to give the chronicles a 'scholarly character.' But if we bother to consider this a little, we will come to the conclusion that even educated representatives of the ruling classes had no need to give the chronicles any 'scholarly character.' At that time it was important for them to have documents proving that the Buryats had the authority for their pedigree or specially allotted lands, that Buryat clan leaders had the right for privileges, and so on. In other words, at that time Buryat</page><page sequence="8">8 Mongolian Studies XXVIII (2006) chroniclers were interested in the official juridical (not scholarly) side of the matter (Tsydendambaev 2001: 128- 129). 14 Among the sources used by the chroniclers were folk legends, Mongolian chronicles, Russian literature dealing with Mongolian studies, documents of the Buryat Steppe Dumas, personal papers and the authors' own observations, and testimony of witnesses. Thus they give many details which cannot be found in any archive. These Buryat chronicles are all the more interesting because in them, Buryats depict the lifestyle of Buryat society by themselves, giving the Buryat viewpoint and public mood of that time. The authors of the Buryat chronicles were educated persons for their time: representatives of the Buddhist priesthood and administrative authorities. Among the most well-known Buryat chroniclers are Vandan Yumsunov, Dambi-Zhalsan Lombotsyrenov, Shirab-Nimbu Khobituev, Tuguldur Toboev, Tsydenzhap Sakharov, Budazhap Budaev and others. Let me give more detailed information about two of these chroniclers: 1) Tuguldur Toboev (c. 1795-1880). He was the author of one of the best-known chronicles of the Khori Buryats: Khoriin bolon Agyn buriaduudai urda sagai tiiiikhe "Past history of Khori and Aga Buryats." He was the main taisha (high official) of the Aga Burayts and stemmed from a noble family of the Khuatsai clan. His forefather was Khabanshi who came from Mongolia and who in 1705 served was a guide and interpreter of the Nerchinsk governor, colonel P. Skripitsin when the latter resolved the most important issues after signing the Nerchinsk treaty in 1689. 2) Thanks to the research of the Russian scholar N.P. Shastina, we now have biographical details on the author of "Notes on the Podgorodnyi (or Turaev) Family," Dolsamdorzhi Gempilon. In her article about the author of Türyn otogoi tiiiikhe "History of the Turaev (i.e. Podgorodnyi) Clan," N.P. Shastina says: [The] author Dolsamdorzhi Gempilon belonged to a quite famous and wealthy family which was founded by Andakhai, who came from Mongolia. Andakhai's elder son Amor was the pride of the family, and was interpreter from the Mongolian language during the negotiations conducted by Savva Raguzhinsky and held after that the rank of zaisan. . . . Dolsamdorzhi Gempilon's father was also a zaisan. Dolsamdorzhi had</page><page sequence="9">Boronoyeva 9 a honored monastic rank of toin, which is granted mostly to those with an aristocratic origin (cited in Tsydendambaev 2001 : 34-35). Summarizing data taken from D. Gempilon's letters addressed to the well-known Mongolist and scholar O.M. Kowalewski, N.P. Shastina comes to a conclusion that Dolsamdorzhi Gempilon was an outstanding person. His correspondence with the chief Mongol school of the nineteenth century contains not only explanations of Lamaism, but also gives analysis of the events that took place in Buryatia. He did his best to help O.M. Kowalewski: got books for him, looked for people who could work at his publishing house and school. He wrote a brief story of his clan. These details of his biography and personality make it possible to include Dolsamdorzhi Gempilon in the small group of Buryat intellectuals of the 19lh century (cited in Tsydendambaev 2001 : 35). Among the rich heritage of written chronicles of the Buryats we have picked out sixteen chronicles published in Russian and Buryat languages (see the list at the conclusion of this article). These include six chronicles of the Khori Buryats, six chronicles of the Selenge Buryats and four chronicles of the Barguzin Buryats. As far as the dates of creation are concerned, the earliest is the historical work of the Khori Buryats Balzhan Khatan tukhai tuuzha domog (written c. 1630-1670), while the latest one is the chronicle of Tsezheb Tserenov Bargazhanai buriaad zonoi tüükhiin tobsho temdeg (1917). Let us underline again that our attempt to define the traditions of Buryat self- identification with the help of the analysis of terms and ethnonyms as found in Buryat chronicles, will likely be useful for research on the modern processes of Buryat self-identification. The Hierarchical Structure of Ethnic Identity: The Clan Branch or Subclan: Khiikhililr, Yahan, Urag After analyzing the chronicles we believe that the lowest level of Buryat socio-ethnic 15 self-identification was the category of clan branch or subclan-in particular, what the Khori Buryats called khiikhiiiir (Russian kukur). This term khükhüür can be found in Vandan Yumsunov's chronicle with this very meaning. "Our main noyon Shildei-zangi from the Zhankhan khükhüür of the Galzuud clan who was our last zangi-noyon, roamed in present Mongolia, not far from the Kherülen River" ( BL 1995: 68; BTB 1992: 63). According to Ts.B. Tsydendambaev:</page><page sequence="10">10 Mongolian Studies XXVIII (2006) Kukurs derived their names after the clan head's sons no matter if they were relatives or aliens . . . Any alien group, irrespective of the time of its joining the clan, was usually considered to be a separate kukur and called according to the former clan name. For instance, in the Galzut clan of the Khori Buryats there are some representatives of the Shono clan of Ekhirit Buryats that call themselves Shono-Galzut, which means Galzut of the Shono kukur (Tsydendambaev 2001 : 66-67). Selenge Buryats, especially representatives of clans with a Mongolian origin, used the term yahan "bone" to name a clan branch. In a passage of Dambi-Zhalsan Lombotsyrenov's chronicle, which describes the religious situation in the Selenge Buryats environment, one can read the following: 1) Selengyn sartuul zeerde azarga yahanai shereete sorzho-lama... "a representative of the Zeerde Azarga bone of the Selenge's Sartuul clan, Shiretui Sorzho-Lama..." ( BTB 1992: 141) 2) Selengyn podgorodno otogoi khurlaad yahanai lama shereete Shirab Andakhai "Shiretui-Lama Shirab Andakhai from the Khurlaad Bone of the Podgorodnyi Clan" (BTB 1992: 135) 3) Tsongool abagad yahanai lama Damba-Darzhaa "Lama Damba- Darzhaa of the Abagad bone of the Tsongool" (Ibid.). As for clan branches among the western Buryats (living west of Lake Baikal), they usually use the term urag (Russian uruk ). Yet it should be mentioned that the clan name Shono followed by the determinative urag found in "The History of People of the Tsongool Clan of the Ekhirit-Bulagat" has raised a discussion. G.N. Rumyantsev has argued that, "probably the Shono clan is a younger establishment than its related clans Hengelder, Abzai, and others. It may represent a separated bone (uruk) of one of the main Ekhirit clans. For example, Hengelder, which accidentally preserved in its name the term meaning "bone" [clan branch-D.B.]." Ts.B. Tsydendambaev, however, disagreed with him. Having studied materials dealing with Buryat ethnonyms, he stated that, "in the western Buryat dialects, the word uruk is used to designate ethnic groups regardless of whether they are clans or bones [i.e. clan branches-D.B.]." In Vandan Yumsunov's chronicle one can find cases where the Khori Buryats too use the term yahan "bone" to designate a clan branch: khoorondoo obog obogoor gii, ali yahaar bolon biileg</page><page sequence="11">Boronoyeva I 1 ailnuudaar khamtaran niiledeg, "they united together into clans, subclans-bones or into groups of ails (families)" ( BTB 1992: 75; BL 1995: 80). This allows us to conclude that the Khori Buryats used the terms khükhüür and yahan simultaneously. Yet khükhüür was the more popular term. Despite the fact that the chronicles give very poor information about clan branches, if we study them very carefully, we can find out that this level of personal identification is used and quite important. The Level of Clan Identity: Obog, Otog, Esege. Subclans were formed into a clan proper. The chronicles show that the clan level of Buryat integration was a fundamental one. It is not an exaggeration to say that it is possible to find this level of identity on practically every page of the chronicles. It is expressed with the help of the terms obog, otog, esege ( BTB 1992: 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, etc.). And this ubiquity is not accidental: some ceremonies and economic management were "locked" within a clan.16 We have studied sixteen chronicles. In the title of the seven of them, the word "clan"17 is used; two chronicles are devoted to description of the history and lifestyle of two particular clans, the Soogol and Podgorodnyi clan to be exact. One chronicle of the Selenge Buryats is structurally built according to the principle of describing the various clans (each of the ten parts of the chronicle is devoted to one of the clans). Studying the Selenge Buryats' chronicles one can gain an interesting picture of the "grouping" of clans: baruun naiman "the western eight," which came from Khalkha Mongolia, 18 and the zurgaan esege "the six clans (or fathers)" that came from the regions west of Lake Baikal.19 One can find data demonstrating that the Tsongool clan was the leading one of those who came from Mongolia: Khalkha-Mongolhoo niiüzhe erehen songool türüütei otoguud endekhi Buriaaduudai 6 otoguudtai khamtaran kholisoldokhon baina "Clans coming from Mongolia, led by the Tsongool, have mixed with six clans of local Buryats" {BTB 1992: 156). Ts. B. Tsydendambaev wrote, "The name Tsongool for some reason was so popular that Buryats living east of Lake Baikal often used it for all Selenge Buryats coming from Mongolia" (Tsydendambaev 2001: 176). Presumably, it was the leading status of the representatives of the Tsongool clan in the group baruun naiman that lead to such wide usage of the clan name Tsongool. Khori Buryats were also divided into two groups of clans, the Galzuud and the Kharagana. The first one consisted of the following</page><page sequence="12">12 Mongolian Studies XXVIII (2006) five clans: Galzuud, Sharaid, Guchid, Khuatsai, and Khübdüüd. The ethno-linguistic phrase taban shara galzuutan "five yellow Galzuud" was used to designate the "union" of these five clans; as we can see, the Galzuud clan was the dominant one. The second group consisted of the remaining six clans: Kharagana, Khudai, Khalbin, Bodonguud, Batanai, Sagaanuud. Oral tradition of the Khori Buryats sometimes groups the clans according to their maternal ancestry20: sharaldain taban "the five Sharaldai" and nagatain naiman "the eight Nagatai." In early Khori chronicles, such as Dorzho Darbaev's, the number of Nagatai clans was reduced to six, because by the time the chronicle was written there were only eleven clans (BL 1995: 172, 174). As Ts. B. Tsydendambaev pointed out, subsequent Khori chronicles did not make major changes in their assertions about Khori patriarchal genealogy. But they still divided Khori clans into "the five Sharaldai" and "the eight Nagatai." In order to conform to the later division of Khori Buryats into eleven clans, some chroniclers (Toboev, Yumsunov) wrote that two of Khoridai's thirteen sons died in childhood C BL 1995: 5, 37; BTB 1992: 12, 36), while other chroniclers (Khobituev, in particular) say that they moved north (i.e. northwest) of Lake Baikal and mixed with the Buryats living there {BTB 1992: 95). Yet another group of chroniclers (for example, as Ts.B. Tsydendambaev noted, the author of "Atsagat Essay of the Khori- Buryats") considered that two of the thirteen sons stayed among the Tümet in Inner Mongolia. In his report, Dorzho Darbaev found it necessary to mention that "long ago the Galzuud, Gushid, Khuatsai and Sharaid sympathized with each other for some reason and decided to become related (by marriage) to each other. And today each generation continues this tradition by becoming marriage relations. I am mentioning it, because as I think it is necessary to know about it" (BL 1995: 172). In our view, the above mentioned materials from the Buryat chronicles show the existence of the phenomenon of clan integration and differentiation which is mostly based upon common place of origin (Khalkha Mongolia, west Baikal region) or common motherhood. In this case, it is important for us to underline that members of one clan and those who belong to "their" group of clans were identified as relatives, which in our opinion is deeply connected with the theme of "blood and soil." One can agree with T.D. Skrynnikova that in Buryat historical chronicles ideas of inborn differences between people, conditioned by their origin, prevail.</page><page sequence="13">Boronoyeva 1 3 The Level of Clan Units: Tribes or Tribal Unions: Khoriin zon, arad zon - and Territorial Units: Selengyn Mongol-Buriaaduud, Bargazhanai Buriaaduud All clans are united into a commonality at a higher level, which in Russian scholarship is called a tribe, or a tribal union. In Buryat chronicles this level of integration is called zon or arad zon ("nation," "people"). In the earliest historical chronicle of the Khori, Balzhan Khatanai tuuzha "The Story of Balzhan Khatun," all representatives of the eleven Khori clans are generally called arba negen esegyn zon, arba negen otog zon "people of the eleven clans (or fathers)" (BTB 1992: 221, 222, 226). The same designation can also be found in T. Toboev's chronicle (BTB 1992: 13, 14, etc.). Moreover, the phrase Khoriin zon "Khori people" is used quite often without any specific mention of the clan level of integration ( BTB 1992: 17, 21, 25, etc.). In V. Yumsunov and S.N. Khobituev's chronicles, apart from the above mentioned designations, there are also some rare cases of using the binóme arad zon "nation" and Khoriin arad zon "Khori people" (BTB 1992: 50, 121), as well as the term ulad (the Buriat form of Mongolian ulus~uls ) "people," e.g. 11 esegyn uladuud, literally "people of the eleven fathers" (BTB 1992: 37). I would like to underline, however, that usage of the term ulad-ulas "people" as a component of the common designation for the whole population of Khori clans that was emphasized by T.D. Skrynnikova (1999: 7) is actually rather exceptional. We believe that the above mentioned semantic meaning of the term is not proved by the materials in the chronicles as seen, for example, in such cases of its usage as Mongoloi ulad zon "citizens of Mongolia" (BTB 1992: 39; BL 1995: 41), tede böögei shazhanai uladuudta "people of Shamanism" (BTB 1992: 51; BL 1995: 55), Buriaad ulasnar "Buryat people," "Buryats" (BTB 1992: 47; BL 1995: 49). In our view, in the examples given above, the term ulas is not being used to name the union of Khori clans, but rather means a broader social context, in which they included themselves or from which they separated themselves. Judging by the materials of the Khori chronicles one can say that at that time (the beginning of the seventeenth century) when the eleven Khori clans moved, or returned to be exact, from eastern Mongolia to the regions east of Lake Baikal (this episode is described in more or less detail in practically all Khori chronicles), they perceived themselves as different or autonomous from the population which they called "Buryats": "Having moved from there they joined the Buryats" (BTB 1992: 38; BL 1995: 39).</page><page sequence="14">14 Mongolian Studies XXVIII (2006) Taking into consideration the fact that in the Khori chronicles, the ethnonym "Buryat" is used to designate all the Mongolian-speaking peoples living west of Lake Baikal, one can conclude that the tribes living there (the Bulagat, Ekhirit, and Khongoodor) were on a considerable level of consolidation and already had a common name. At that time the Khori people did not yet call themselves Buryat and did not include themselves among the Buryat tribes. "... when we lived and settled down in Olkhon and Kudara and in the northern parts of Baikal region, we moved with Buryats ..." ( BTB 1 992: 52; BL 1995: 54). V. Yumsunov's chronicle is particularly interesting in showing the moments of the Khori people's identification with, or sometimes opposition to the neighboring ethnic groups of Buryats (living in the regions west of Lake Baikal) and Mongols in terms of religion. In the chapter devoted to Buddhism, his chronicle constantly underlines that the Khori clans were connected with the Mongols and were their successors. Inversely, in the chapter describing the spread of shamanism among the Buryats, he writes: "At first our Khori people professed the religion of Buddha Shakyamuni... but... since those Buryats had always believed in Shamanism, men became male- shamans and women became female-shamans" {BTB 1992: 52; BL 1995: 54-55). Domination of one of the two religious traditions- Buddhism east of Lake Baikal and Shamanism in the west-with different degrees of Orthodox and other Christian dissemination among the local population caused differences in cultural traditions of the people living in these regions. In this respect it is worth mentioning that alongside with integration processes among Mongolian-speaking tribes of the Baikal region, a process of differentiation between western and eastern Buryat tribes and communities according to religion also took place. Reading the story about a well known man named Shildei-zangi, one can trace the stability, deep consciousness, and clarity of the tribal level of the Khori people's ethno-social organization. The story was described in particular in V. Yumsunov's and S.N. Khobituev's chronicles. Briefly the essence of the story is as follows: After the Russo-Mongolian border was determined, a part of the Khori people headed by Shildei-zangi,22 the chief noyon (nobleman) of all the Khori clans, had to stay in Mongolia, because the free migration of people was no longer allowed.2 Those Khori who found themselves in Mongolia then started moving to Russia to join their relatives. But they were arrested by the Russian frontier guards and remanded to the authorities. They in turn accused Shildei-zangi, the leader of the</page><page sequence="15">Boronoyhva 15 migration movement, of illegally crossing the state frontier and sentenced him to be punished. The people of the eleven Khori clans that followed him were deported back to the khoshuu (banner) of Dalai Beise Janchib-Dorji in Mongolia's Tsetsen-Khan aimag. In 1734 they moved to Hulun-Buir and came to be called the Shine Barga "New Bargut." In the chronicles, this separated branch of the Khori people are traditionally called "brothers," or "relatives" ( BTB 1992: 38; BL 1995: 40). Indeed, having compared their clan components, D.D. Nimaev, a Buryat scholar of issues of ethnogenesis, concluded that the New Barguts are an ethnic community very close to the modern Khori Buryats (Nimaev 2000: 165). According to our research carried out in Hulun-Buir, in consciousness of many modern Barguts the image of Shildei-Zangi symbolizes the attempt to reunite one artificially separated ethnic whole. The place of Shidei-zangi's execution and his grave-the mountain Gezgetyn Khaan Uula (or Gevzetyn oboo)- are places of special worship for these ethnic communities. The later migration of Buryats to Barga from 1918 to the 1930s was evidently treated by both the Khori-buryats and the New Barguts as a new attempt at reunification. That is why during the first years after the Buryats' immigration, related and neighboring Barguts assisted them greatly and were the main ethnic partner as far as marriages outside of the Buryat community were concerned. Territorial units: Selengyn mongol-buriaaduud , bargazhanai buriaaduud 24 The colonization process that started in Siberia influenced the typical lifestyle and pattern of settlement of the native population. Some scholars, D.D. Nimaev in particular, pointed out first of all the ever more intensive character of migration among aborigines that had already led a rather nomadic life before then. This was caused by a number of reasons-attempts to avoid payment of the yasak tax, abuses by the local Russian administration, economic activities of the migrants, etc. (Nimaev 2000: 160). The Selenge River valley became one of the zones of such intensive migrations. As the Russo- Mongolian frontier was very close, the main direction of the migrations was from Russia to Mongolia and vice versa. In addition, there were mass migrations of western Buryat clans from Cis-Baikalia into the Selenge valley. As a result of the mixing of western clans (the zurgaan esege)25 with clans from Northern Mongolia (the baruun naiman)2b there appeared a large new territorial group-the Selenge Buryats or as they are also called in the chronicles, the Selenge</page><page sequence="16">1 6 Mongolian Studies XX VIII (2006) Buryat-Mongols (or Mongol-Buryats). Historically, this name stuck to the population that was registered at the Selenge fort founded in 1665, and was later used for the people registered in the Selenge Steppe Duma and the Tsongool "alien council." A comparatively independent group of people, the Barguzin Buryats ( bargazhanai buriaaduud ), were founded in the valley of the Barguzin River on the basis of Ekhirit and some other clans which joined them. According to the oral tradition of the Barguzin Buryats and their historical chronicles, they moved "to Barguzin a little bit before 1 740 from the Anga area of Verkholensk district in Irkutsk province, which is situated in the northern part of Lake Baikal" ( BL 1995: 177). Among the Barguzin there are descendants of the representatives of eight exogamous clans ( naiman khari, naiman esegyn zon ): Hengelder, Shono, Abzai, Bayandai, Emkhened, Bulagad, Galzuud, Segeened. It is our belief that we can treat such territorial units as groups at the same level of the ethno-social hierarchy as tribal units, because there are stable local ethnonyms: "Barguzin Buryats" ( bargazhanai buriaaduud-BTB 1992: 161, etc.; bargazhan buriaaduud-BTB 1992: 165, 166), "Selenge Buryats" ( Selengyn buriaaduud-BTB 1992: 131,134,137, etc.) and their synonymous conventional names, which indicate directly that they are unions of clans-'people of the eight clans/fathers" {naiman esegyn zon-BTB 1992: 171), "the western eight" (baruun naiman-BL 1995: 196), etc. The Level of the Ethnic Group27 "Buryats "-"buriaad zon, " " buriaaduud " As was already mentioned, materials from the Buryat chronicles prove that the ethnonym "Buryat," used nowadays to designate the whole nation, was used in the seventeenth century to designate only those Mongolian-speaking tribes living in Cisbaikalia: the Bulagats and Ekhirit.28 After that, an extension of the ethnic and geographic boundaries of the community named with the ethnonym "Buryat" took place (Skrynnikova 1999: 8). In other words the term was expanded into a "supra-tribal" name. Immediate contacts of Khori and Khalkha Mongolian people with bearers of the ethnonym "Buryat" played a determining role in this process of recruitment into Buryat membership. Thus T. Toboev writes: "Since at that time the Buryat people (zon) were the original settlers living north and south of Lake Baikal, they [the Khori Buryats-D.B.] imitated them and started calling themselves Buryats of eleven Khori clans," i.e. following the</page><page sequence="17">Boronoyeva 17 Russian name ( BTB 1992: 14; BL 1995: 7).29 Another chronicler, V. Yumsumov adds detail to T. Toboev's statement and writes that the people of the Khori clans . . joined the Buryats . . . and that was the reason why they were called Khori Buryats" {BTB 1992: 38; BL 1995: 39-40). In the Selenge chronicles, in which the ethnonym Buryat is used quite often, especially in Saintsak Yumov's historical notes, it is also underlined that "the clans ( otoguud) that came from Mongolia and were headed by the Songool [Tsongool] clan, joined the six clans ( otoguud) of the local Buryats and mixed in with them" {BTB 1992: 156). T.D. Skrynnikova has paid special attention to how the Khori Buryats and the local Buryats were made into a common community, by being "historically" grounded with their common genealogical background and their mythological forefathers (Skrynnikova 1999: 8). As far as one can judge from the account of her research, the Buryats in their traditional consciousness "constructed boundaries" by way of "inspiring the creation of new versions of ethno-genetic myths, which aimed at explaining the new content of the created communities on the basis of blood-related ties" (Skrynnikova 2003: 27, 76). Indeed, ethno-genetic myths and legends as narrated in Buryat chronicles, underwent "processing." As G.N. Rumyantsev points out, Chroniclers narrate folk myths, which they are aware of, in a very brief variant and the myths' interpretation as given in their works differs from the ones existing in oral form and narrated in public. As we know, the major genealogical myths of the Buryats speaking about the origin of Ekhirit, Bulagat, and Khori people still exist separately. They are evidently the most ancient variants. The chroniclers are trying to unite these myths into a single common one, which would connect the three major Buryat tribes by means of their common origin. The reason is obviously that the authors are trying to view the Ekhirit, Bulagat, and Khori people as a united nation (Rumyantsev I960: 14). In the legend of the female shaman Aisukhan and the myth of Bargu Baatur and his sons, the name Buriaadai can be found. This Buriaadai is considered to be the forefather of pre-Baikal Buryats, that consist mostly of the Bulagat and Ekhirit clans. Meanwhile, Khoridai is considered to be a younger brother and forefather of the Khori Buryats.30 Let use the materials of the three major Khori chronicles by T. Toboev, V.Yumsunov and S.N. Khobituev to examine cases of the use</page><page sequence="18">1 8 Mongolian Studies XXVIII (2006) of the ethnonym "Buryat." It should be underlined that there is an obvious connection between the chronicles' titles and those factors which determine how the authors define the community of the Khori people: local or tribal level, or else their membership in a wider coalition, in this case in the Buryat community. For instance, T. Toboev gave his chronicle the title Khoriin bolon Agyn Buriaaduudai urda sagai tüükhe "Past history of Khori and Aga Buryats." Throughout his chroncle, the ethnonym Buryat is used alongside other O I ethnonyms, mostly to show the tribal and territorial level: "Khori Buryats" {Khoriin Buriaaduud; see BL 1995: 8, 12, 16, 18), "Aga Buryats" (Agyn Buriaaduud ; see e.g. BL 1995: 25, 27, 28). In our view, these terms of self-designation are basic in Toboev's work as they are the most numerous. In the part of his work devoted to religious traditions-shamanism and Buddhism-the author refers to the common Buryat level of integration and uses the term Buriaad zon "Buryat nation," "Buryats" (BTB 1992: 19-20, 27; BL 1995: 14, 27), and judging from the context in which the term Buriaad zon is used, one can say that it is in connection with Buddhism.32 This can lead us to a conclusion that even in the Buryat chronicle tradition, Buddhism was seen as the power to consolidate and integrate the "Buryat people." Forming an ethno-confessional communion of Buryats living in Transbaikalia is focused on in the phrase Baigalai ümenekhi Buriaad buddyn shazhantan "Buryat Buddhists of Transbaikalia" (BTB 1992:21). V. Yumsunov's chronicle is called Khoriin arban esegyn ug izaguurai tuuzha "History of the Origin of the Eleven Khori Clans." The most used variant of the name for the Khori people is the one given in the chronicle's title: Khoriin arban negen esegyn zon "the people of the eleven Khori clans (or fathers)" (BTB 1992: 34, 37, 38, 39 etc.). As for the ethnonym buriaad zon "Buryat people," "Buryats," it is used in describing situations of Russo-Buryat conflict.33 These conflicts are caused by problems of land and the economy. In the seventh chapter of Yumsunov's chronicle, titled "About the Rights of Land Ownership," one can read: "As for the remaining lands apart from the above mentioned 105,000 dessiatinas34 of land along the Ingoda River and tributary streams given to the peasants, they ought to have remained in the ownership of the Khori people. Yet the peasants and other Russian and Cossack people misappropriated the lands and would not let the Buryat people (buriaad zoniie ) camp there at all" (BTB 1992: 75; BL 1995: 79). V. Yumsunov also gives a brief extract from one decree, which said:</page><page sequence="19">Boronoyeva 19 "Russians and peasants must build their fences well and make them of high quality. Illegal seizure of Buryat livestock ( buriaadai malnuudie) is prohibited" (BTB 1992: 74; BL 1995: 79). We believe that the examples given above of the use of the supra- tribal name "Buryat" shows that the representatives of the Buriats' creative minority, V. Yumsumov in particular, tended to use the authority of a community with a higher level of integration (in comparison with a tribal one), i.e. the Buryat nation, in order to protect their local ethnic interests from their powerful and more numerous neighbor, the Russians.35 In our view, the chroniclers understood the unequal conditions of this dialogue fully, but tried to make the status of Khori people ( Khoriin zon ) equal to the status of the impinging nationality, the Russians, by means of joining Khori people to an ethnic whole, the Buryat nationality. From this viewpoint one can say that the ethno-cultural, economic, and other contacts between the Russians and the Mongolian-speaking nations promoted the process of consolidation among the latter. The key moment in this opposition-based self-categorization (we are Khori, they are Russians) is the tendency to determine the ethnic boundaries of the "we" within the framework of ever wider and greater coalitions. In V. Yumsunov's chronicle, for example, one can also find some traces of an ethno- confessional community of "Trans-Baikal Buddhists" (BL 1995: 44, 45, 49) and some peculiarities of their religious life, where one can see for example such a phrase as "representatives of the Buddhists of the Buryat people" {BL 1995: 53). Thus one can state that V. Yumsunov depicted the reality of his epoch, when an intensive integration process was taking place and Buddhism was one factor that helped overcome divisions between various Buryat groups. As Ts.B. Tsydendambaev says, S.N. Khobituev's historical work "was and still remains the most popular historical chronicle among Khori Buryats" (Tsyendambaev 2002: 56), which means its content had public approval and was the closest to the viewpoints shared by the community. The complete title of his chronicle is "History of Eleven Khori Clans, Included in the Buryat Nation and Living in Eastern Siberia of Russian State." One can say that one great difference of this work from those mentioned above is that the ethnonym "Buryat" ( buriaad zon) is the most prominent in it. Let us attempt to define only the key themes in which the ethnonym "Buryat" is used. 1) Land questions ( BTB 1992: 96, 98, 104, 106); 2) Religious sphere of life, as connected with Buddhism ( BTB 1992: 111, 1 14, 123); 3) Official contacts with representatives of the Russian</page><page sequence="20">20 Mongol ian Studies XXV III (2006) administration (BTB 1992: 116, 119, 122); 4) Activities of the nation's representatives outside of the territory of their settlement, for example in St. Petersburg ( BTB 1992: 118, 121). In our view, S.N. Khobituev's work is one of the most interesting among the Khori chronicles from the viewpoint of the question of the spread of the ethnonym "Buryat" as an supra-tribal name among the Khori people. As for Selenge people, coming from Khalkha Mongolia, their chronicles show that they also included themselves within the community designated by the ethnonym "Buryat": selengyn buriaaduud " Selenge Buryats" (BTB 1992: 131, 134, 137 etc.). At the same time T.D. Skrynnikova was right to point out that "perhaps the ethnonym Mongol-Buriaaduud was even more real for them" (Skrynnikova 1999: 10). Among, the Selenge chronicles Dolsamdorzhi Gempilon's historical work is the most interesting one from the viewpoint of defining the chronicle's specific variants in making the image "We are Buryats." The work's title is "History of Podgorodnyi (or Turaev) Clan's Origin" ( Tiiryn otogoi tüükhe.) Let us supply some parts of the chronicle that are necessary as initial analytical material. The founder of the Podgorodno clan was Andakhai, who came from Khalkha Mongolia.36 On the day when all Khoton people went to a great holiday at the Buddhist monastery, Andakhai left home without saying a word to anyone. He took some light goods, food to eat, and departed with his pregnant wife, a Chakhar woman, his four sons and a lama kinsman. Going day and night, they crossed the Khunzhai pass and forded the Jida ( Zede ) and Zheltura Rivers and finally got to the frontier settlements. About a month after they got here, his son was born ( BL 1995: 163). The son was given the name Muukhai. When he was twenty-one years old, he got angry with his brothers who teased him: "We are all Mongols and you are the only Buryat!" and left for Mongolia to see his uncle, Duke llden, and to bring back a handful of the soil of his fatherland ( BL 1995: 165). When he met his uncle, he called him an "uncouth Buryat." Muukhai tried to explain him that he had come here because it was the land where his father had been born and asked for permission to stay, but was refused ( BL 1995: 166). This material presents a rare historical description of the emotional perception of ethnicity on an individual level. We interpret this as demonstrating the importance of the notions of "origin" and</page><page sequence="21">Boronoyeva 2 1 "motherland" as ethnically characteristic features. As we can see, in forming the idea of what it means to be a Buryat, the notion of the land where a man was born and brought up plays a determining role. As we see it, it also means that the category of state borders plays an important role: "We are Mongols [by origin, because we were born in Mongol ia-D.B.] and you are the only Buryat [because he was born on Buryat land, not in Mongolia-D.B.]," as the chronicle says. It is very important for us to pay attention to Muukhai's feeling: who does he consider himself to be, given his fundamental connections with two communities: the Mongolians and the Buryats? Following the work of Russian scholar V.A. Tishkov one can presuppose that the process of self-identification is made by realizing a distinction as one of the elements of one's multi-identification (Tishkov 1997: 10): "1 am Buryat, but I am Mongol too." That is what he was trying to prove by his walk to Mongolia. The Level of Belonging to a Meta-Ethnic Community of Mongols: buriaad-mongolnuud, buriaad mongolshuud, mongol-buriaad. Practically all the chronicles we have studied have more or less common Mongolian themes: whether it deals with a brief historical overview of some events, or with the settlement of major ethnic groups including those among the community called Buryats nowadays, or with problems of their origin, or with the spread of Buddhism among them, etc. After studying the chronicles one gets the impression of the Buryats as a part of a common Mongolian world. Since T.D. Skrynnikova has already made a detailed analysis of Khori and Selenge chronicles in the context of the paradigm "Buryat- Mongols" (Skrynnikova 1999: 10-11; Skrynnikova 2003: 28-30), we shall briefly consider here only the Barguzin chronicles and then use materials from the Selenge chronicles to explore the significant nuances in the usage of the ethnonyms Buryat-Mongol and Mongol- Buryat.37 Documentation of the Barguzin Buryats' belonging to the common Mongolian world is presented in many chronicles. Let us try to systematize these references thematically. Firstly, let us consider the Barguzin land ( bargazhan niutag), as the initial territory of the Mongolian people's settlement and the Barguzin Buryats as the successors of this tradition. Ts. Tsyrenov, the author of one of the Barguzin chronicles, begins his work with the fact that long ago in Barguzin lived Börte-chino, who was the legendary forefather of the Mongols and Chinggis Khan and that the famous mountain Burqan-</page><page sequence="22">22 Mongolian Studies XXVI11 (2006) Qaldun is the mountain Barkhan Uula located in Barguzin38 ( BTB 1992: 168-169). Another chronicle written by Tsedebzhab Sakharov says of Barguzin that "In old legends Chinggis Khan migrated in the territory here" {BTB 1992: 163; 51,1995: 179). In the same work one can find some reference to how the "Bargut Mongol tribe {yahatan ) called the Aba-Khorchin" lived in Barguzin, which "left for China because they thought their land would be conquered by Russia" and they "comprise the twenty khoshuuns [banners] of the Khorchin" {BTB 1992: 162; BL 1995: 178).39 About 1740 when Buryats moved from Verkholensk district of Irkutsk province to Barguzin, the Evenkis that were living there were hostile and incited conflict with the Buryats, including robbery and even murder. Then the Buryats also decided to move to "their Mongolian land" {Mongol gazaraa niiükhe hanaashalga tiirezhe . . . ekhilbe ; BTB 1992: 161-62). Subsequently, however, the conflict between the Buryats and the Evenkis was resolved peacefully. As Ts. Sakharov writes about the Buryats, "Mongolia for various reasons lost their state to the Manchu emperor, and when the Russian warriors came to Siberia, the Buryats knelt to them . . . and without moving to China, became the Tsar's subjects voluntarily" {BTB 1992: 163; BL 1995: 179). Secondly, let us examine the Barguzin Buryats' linkage to the meta-ethnic community of Mongols on the basis of ethno-genetic ideas about their common origin: "We Barguzin Buryats consider ourselves to be from the Ööled tribe of the Zunghar Mongols in ancient times. It is said that sixty to seventy people who came from Zunghar Mongolia joined the Barguzin Buryats and lived together with them. The names of the clans of the Ööled Mongols and the Barguzin and Buriats west of Lake Baikal-Ekhirit, Bulagat, Buruut, Galzuut-are similar" {BTB 1992: 163-64; BL 1995: 180). Thirdly, we find descriptions of cultural phenomena that have a common Mongolian significance: "More than fifty years ago in Barguzin, they still followed the military rules of Chinggis Khan and every three years would hold a battue (round-up style) hunt. In such hunts, all the men from every clan ( otog ) who could handle a bow and arrow went out and killed every sort of game" {BTB 1992: 164; BL 1995: 180). Fourthly, concrete facts are noted to show the continuing connection of the Barguzin Buryats with Mongolia: "In 1842, a year of the snow leopard, a great scholar Gegen Lama Galsan Sodbo came from Mongolia's Khorchin khoshuuns (banners) to Barguzin. He . . . built the chapel Marashim-Bumbar in the place called Galgatui on the Lower Kuitun" {BL 1995: 182-183). In 1862, a year of the dog, a</page><page sequence="23">Boronoyeva 23 Mongolian lama Gebshi [a scholarly title] Damdin Dorzhi came from Mongolia." In 1863 "for the first time, one Buryat, Garma Tankhaev by name, and his eleven companions visited the Bogdo-Khüreen of Urga [modern Ulaanbaatar] in Mongolia to carry on trade. It was the beginning of trips to Mongolia. After that many people started visiting Mongolia and they still go there today" ( BL 1995: 1 85). We believe that the above-mentioned is enough evidence to show that in the Buryat social environment, and especially among the Barguzin Buryats, there were ideas of a common historical background among representatives of the Mongolian world and that such mutual connections between the Mongolians and them were quite natural. At the same time it should be mentioned that in chronicles it is quite evident that the reader should understand the differences between them were conditioned by their separation. For instance, T. Sakharov describes this phenomenon as follows: akha diiii mongol yahatanai kharilsaa barisaan taharzha, dundaa tus btiriin ilgabaritai bolobo "As the ties between us, with our brothers, the Mongolian people, have been lost, differences have appeared between us both" ( BTB 1992: 163). And now let us say a few words about the ethnonyms buriaad- mongolnuud (e.g. BTB 1992: 132), buriaad-mongolshuud (e.g. BTB 1992: 139, 152) and mongol-buriaad (e.g. BTB 1992: 152), terms which are mostly used in the Selenge chronicles.40 As far as we know, it is Bishykhan zapiska, "Brief Notes," alone among the chronicles that displays the terminological stability of using just one ethnonym from the list above (i.e. mongol-buriaad; see BTB 1992: 179, 183, 184, 185, 187, 189, 190). As scholars have already remarked, "Brief Notes" is a composition mechanically concocted out of a number of previously existing historical chronicles and genealogical notes (Tsydendambaev 2001: 85). As for the section of "Brief Notes" entitled "Historical Notes on the Eight Selenge Clans," Ts.B. Tsydendambaev pointed out that it was mostly from an already "canonized" text that was "the earliest more or less independent historical work, that served as the basis for further development of Selenge Buryats' chronicles" (Tsydendambaev 2001: 83). In this respect we think it is important to pay attention to one essential aspect, which we would dare to call an "editorial ideology." As far as we know, each of the ten parts of "Brief Notes" was written by a different author, who was a representative of the said clan being described (and which had come from Mongolia). Later the ten parts were united into one chronicle. Taking into consideration the fact that</page><page sequence="24">24 Mongolian Studies XXVIII (2006) all parts of the chronicle conform to a general scheme of narration and that there is an obvious terminological coordination between the authors, one may presume that during the production of this collective chronicle there was some "editorial" unification of the chroniclers' conceptual-terminological bases. As for the time of composition, the Selenge chronicles such as those of Dambi-Zhalsan Lombo-Tsyrenov and Saintsak Yumov were definitely composed later. These chronicles' titles contain the ethnonym mongol-buriaad, yet their contents demonstrate the usage of other variants for example buriaad- mongolshuud. We believe that the phenomenon of a defined traditional usage of the ethnonym mongol-buriaad as seen in the "Brief Notes" can be interpreted as the "officially" established form of the Selenge Buryats' self-identification, one traditionally used in the chronicles. Initially it meant "Mongolian Buryats" or "Buryats of Mongolian origin." Making the latter statement, we would like to draw the reader's attention to the fact that in the "Brief Notes" the ethnonym Mongol-Buryat is only used for clans that originated from Mongolia. Indeed, we may consider if it is appropriate for Mongolian nations to use double ethnonyms, the first part of which serves as an adjective (qualifier) and the second part-as a noun (common name).41 Having examined the usages of the ethnonym mongol-buriaad as used by D.Z. Lombotsyrenov and S. Yumov, we conclude that in their chronicles its meaning varies: in some cases it is used to name only representatives of the western Buryat clans (strangely enough) who settled in the Selenge valley ( BTB 1992: 155), in some cases it designates all the Selenge clans ( BTB 1992: 135, 152, 154), and in still other cases it indicates the entire Mongolian-speaking population of Siberia {BTB 1992: 126, 156). As we mentioned before, other ethnonyms apart from mongol-buriaad, such as buriaad-mongolnuud and buriaad-mongolshuud, are used in D.Z. Lombotsyrenov's and S. Yumov's chronicles. The term buriaad-mongolnuud, though, is found only once in D.Z. Lombotsyrenov's chronicle ( BTB 1992: 132) and nowhere else.42 As for the term buriaad-mongolshuud, however, it is used in the chronicles alongside such terms as khalkha-mongolshuud, ööled-mongolshuud ( BTB 1992: 155) and plain mongolshuud ( BTB 1992: 130). It marks the Buryats as an organic part of the Mongolian world and as one big ethnic unit included within the "family" of Mongolian nations. Taking into consideration that this ethnonym ( buriaad-mongolshuud) is mostly used in reporting the spread of Buddhism in eastern Siberia (e.g. BTB 1992: 146, 152) it is quite</page><page sequence="25">Boronoyeva 25 logical to consider the history of Buddhism to be one of the basic factors linking the nations of the Mongolian world. The Ethno-Confessional Level: The Buryats Within Buddhist Civilization: buriaad buddy n shazhantan or " Buryat-Buddhists " The traditions of Buryat self-identification described above do deal with the religious sphere of life in one way or another. Thus we would now like to draw attention to some noteworthy points concerning the religious traditions active in the Buryat environment: shamanism, Buddhism, and Christianity. Even so, one can be quite clear that in the chronicles it is the Buddhist religious tradition that is socially dominant among the Selenge, Khori and Barguzin Buryats. Since there was no central ethno-national administrative body, the Buddhist sangha (monastic assembly) was the sole common Buryat ethno- national socio-cultural institution. As a result of its successful adaptation to the local environment, and the adoption of some shamanist cults into Buddhist ceremonies, Buddhism managed to attract Buryat shamanists and an ethno-confessional community was formed among the eastern Buryats: buddyn shazhantanai buriaad zon "Buryats of the Buddhist religion" ( BTB 1992: 51) or as it is also called in the chronicles, Baigalai ümenekhi buriaad buddyn shazhantan "Buryat-Buddhists of the Trans-Baikal region" ( BTB 1992: 21; cf. 102). According to many scholars of Buddhism and the Buryats, this alien religion was initially unintelligible for the masses, but then gradually became the real, or even one can say national, religion of the Buryats (Abaeva 1992; Mikhailov 1999 etc.).43 As a result of Buddhism's penetration into Buryat ordinary life, Buryat culture and Buddhist culture have became virtually synonymous in eastern Siberia. Buddhism eventually become an important ethnic identifying feature. In order to find a mechanism of explanation as to why the Buryats became included in the Buddhist world the chronicles' authors refer to the genetic relationship between the powers among the Mongols and Buryats with the kingly clans of the Buddhist states. "The idea of three Buddhist monarchies as worked out by Mongolian historiography (India, Tibet and Mongolia) indeed becomes popular, but in another version, they are Tibet, Mongolia, and Buryatia. . . . The latter is often considered not as a single whole, but as a number of separate Buryat groups: Selenge, Khori, Aga Buryats and Khamnigan" (Skrynnikova 2003: 30). As T. D. Skrynnikova has pointed out, "the activities of the monasteries ( datsansý 4 covered all spheres of life in Buryat society.</page><page sequence="26">26 Mongolian Studies XXVIII (2006) As cult centers, the datsans promoted Buddhist religion among Buryats with the help of the system of datsan education (faculties: academic, philosophical, medical, arts), through promotion of Buddhist literature (opening publishing workshops to publish xylographs in Mongolian and Tibetan languages-religious books, didactic literature, textbooks etc.), making ritual objects and training the Buryat intellectual elite" (Skrynnikova 2003: 31). They extended the Buryats' knowledge about the values of Buddhist culture in general. Unlike the processes of disseminating Buddhism in the heartlands of Tibet and Mongolia, in Buryatia the process took place alongside the dissemination of Christianity in its Russian Orthodox version.45 It is worth mentioning that these two world religions began spreading in the areas of Buryat settlement almost at the same time. One of them (Buddhism) became "the living soul of the traditional culture of the nation" (as the well known Orientalist N.V. Abaev figuratively calls it), while, the other one, Orthodoxy, was, as a Moscow researcher E.A. Stroganova writes, "perceived by many Buryats as a symbol of violation, as a religion brought from the very country which was dictating 'alien' rules of land ownership and abrogating 'native' rights" (Stroganova 2001: 44).46 It was a kind of concentrated expression of "Russianism" (Stroganova 200 1 : 45). This brings us to the final level of Buryat self-consciousness, that connected with their incorporation into Russia. The Level of State Community: Buryats as Citizens of the Russian Empire: sagaan khanai albata arad The Buryats' recognition of their Russian citizenship is expressed with the help of such terms as albata, albata arad ( BTB 1992: 14, 37, 97, 98, 179, 185, 187, 189 etc.); khar'iaata, and albata khar'iaata ( BTB 1992: 171), all of which may be translated as "citizens," or medelde baikha-orokho {BTB 1992: 155, etc.), which means "to be or come under someone's authority." With only rare exceptions, the content of the chronicles display a generally positive attitude towards Russia, or to be exact to its supreme authority, the Tsar. Judging by the image of the Tsar (who was seen as virtually divine) found in Buryat chronicles, one can say that in the traditional Buryat view, the Tsar was perceived "autonomously" from the surrounding Russian population, as a kind of independent power, capable of protecting them against injustice, including Russian tyranny. The Buddhist religion contributed to the inculcation of a positive attitude towards the throne of the Tsar. It should not be forgotten that</page><page sequence="27">Boronoyeva 27 the "Government of the Tsar authorized the establishment of Buryat Buddhist temples, but with a condition of great importance: that they serve the Tsar and the state. Every new head of the Buddhist religion, the Khambo-Lama, on inauguration took an oath in front of the governor-general. And he, together with his numerous lamas, taught the people to Move governing authorities'" (Mikhailov 1999a: 57). In the Buryat chronicles there are many cases where the Buryats participate in all-Russian activities. For example, they helped establish and protect the state border ( BTB 1 992: 1 34, 1 56), joined a celebration of victory over Napoleon that took place in Kyakhta, the bogdo- khaanai nair "Holiday of His Holiness, the Tsar" {BTB 1992: 141), gave financial assistance to open up the Amur region and annex it to Russia ( BTB 992: 85), and so on. One cannot disagree with T.M. Mikhailov when he writes that under the influence of world events and as a result of the expansion of their world vision, the Buryats began to realize their Russian citizenship (Mikhailov 1999a: 57), since Buryat life had already gone beyond the boundaries of the territorial- clan community and ethnic group. Conclusion According to the materials found in the Buryat chronicles, we can thus draw up the following schematic representation of the levels of Buryat ethnic self-identification that existed in the middle and at the end of the 19th century. The Level of Clan Branch ~ Subclan: khiikhiiiir, yahan, urag The Level of Clan Identity: obog, otog, esege (including clan groups, for example baruun naiman ("the western eight" coming from Khalkha Mongolia) and zurgaan esege ("the six clans" coming from the West Baikal); sharaldain taban ("the Sharaldai five") and nagatain naiman ("the Nagatai eight")</page><page sequence="28">28 Mongolian Studies XX VI 1 1 (2006) The Level of Clan Unions: a. Tribes ~ Tribal Unions: khoriin zon, khoriin arad zon b. Territorial Unions: selengyn mongol-buriaaduud/ bargazhanai buriaaduud The Level of the Ethnic Group "Buryat": buriaad zon, buriaaduud The Meta-Ethnic Level of the Mongol Community: buriaad-mongolnuud, buriaad mongolshuud, mongol-buriaad The Ethno-Confessional Level: The Buryats In Buddhist Civilization: buriaad buddyn shazhantan ("Buryat Buddhists") The Level of State Community: Buryats as Citizens of the Russian Empire: sagaan khanai albata arad We believe that the above scheme represents the set of real and potential ethnic/social coalitions available for historical Buryats. Individual and collective identities travel up and down this set, and choice may be made depending on the given situation. One probably should not consider the final two levels as ethnic ones, but when we take into consideration the fact that it was these two factors (the spread of Buddhism and incorporation into Russia) that played the key role in consolidating tribal and clan units into the ethnic group now known as the Buryats, we believe it is appropriate to include them into this scheme. All the more so as the stability of the functioning of the other levels was primarily conditioned by the administrative system established by the Russian authorities and the organization of Buryat Buddhist church, which were indeed closely connected with the traditional clan-tribal structure of Buryat society. One may say that it is beyond a reasonable doubt that the Buryats' linkage to the Buddhist</page><page sequence="29">Boronoyeva 29 world and to Russian culture and society has amounted to a Buryat linkage to both Eastern and Western civilizations. This may be represented in the following diagram: In considering expressions of ethnicity, V.A. Tishkov, director of the Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has pointed out that external concepts (i.e. categorizations made by outsiders-D.B.) about ethnic communities tend to over generalize and stereotype. Internal concepts (i.e. ethnic self- categorization-D.B.) are usually more situation-dependant (Tishkov 1997: 16). In our view, the Buryat material demonstrates this thesis clearly. In conclusion, we would like to emphasize once again that one of the most effective ways to understand the modern processes of the Buryat revival is by refering to the past models of Buryat ethnic identification, such as I have presented here drawing on the Buryat chronicles. The Buryat national/cultural revival of the past two decades has looked to the past and the prestige of tradition and history. And as a result, traditional forms of Buryat self-identification are selected that respond to the modern ethnic interests of Buryats or, to be exact, their leaders and spokesmen. Studying traditional modes of Buryat self-identification that found their reflection in the chronicles may also be productive for diachronic analysis and understanding the new modes of identification that are dictated by o, (h' r : j|j|.

It is possible that our research is incomplete due to the lack of sources. Yet even so, we hope that our study of the Buryat chronicle heritage is another proof of the fact that such historical sources still contain hidden "texts," which have yet to be read. Let me finish this paper the way that Buryat compositions in the chronicle tradition were completed: "May all whoever is knowledgeable and wise examine this and correct it, added what is missing, deleting what is superfluous, and emending what is erroneous" (BTB 1992: 32; BL 1995: 30). NOTES 1 According to a number of scholars, some important features of the Buryat language can be explained as a result of interaction with the Evenk language (e.g. the pharyngeal "h" and the more monotonous, slower tempo of speech in comparison with other Mongolian languages). Bargujin is a toponym, which is still used nowadays; as for its component tukum there are different variants of its interpretation. For instance, T.A. Bergtagaev considers this word to be a variant of the term tiirkhem , which means "native place; homeland of a married woman." That is why he suggested translating the word combination Bargujin-Tukum as "native or home Bargujin." T.D. Skrynnikova thinks that the term "tukum" has the same origin as its homonym from the Iran languages, which means "semen" that is used to name notions of "patronimia" or "lineage." D.D. Nimaev suggested a more prosaic way to explain the term "tukum." He thinks it means "depression, hollow, lowlands" and the name "Bargujin-Tukum" is to be interpreted as "Barguzin valley, hollow," which conforms to physical and geographic peculiarities of the place. 3 According to a number of scholars, in the 12-1 3l centuries in the Baikal region there were three main tribal unions: 1. Khori-tumat; 2. Bargut; 3. Buryats including Bulgachin, Keremüchin and probably Ikeres that are considered to be proto- Buryat. Temüjin (Chinggis Khan) was born in 1162 in Deli'un-Boldoq on the river Onon which is seven kilometers away from modern Russian-Mongolian border in the east of Lake Baikal region. 5 Taking into consideration that there is a popular view that the Baikal region voluntarily joined Russia, I would like to give a well-known Buryat historian D.D. Nimaev's perspective on this question: Analyzing the character of Buryatia's union with Russia, one cannot say it was voluntary. Namely, the notion of "voluntariness" cannot be used under the circumstances. Obviously, in history there are very few cases when a state, or a nation, voluntary accepts all the "goods" of alien foreign patronage. The only way to do that is by force. The</page><page sequence="31">Boronoyeva 3 1 apparent loyalty of any part of the society can just be conditioned by the situation wherein it has to choose the lesser of two evils. 6 By the beginning of the 17th century, the tribes living west of Lake Baikal (the Ekhirit, Bulagat, and at least a part of the Khongodor) were on a considerable stage of ethnic consolidation. That is proved by the common name-Buryats ( braty or " bratskie people") - as was mentioned in the early reports of Russian Kazaks. Such a development was quite a natural phenomenon for those living long term in the same territory. The process of internal consolidation was also promoted by the fact that the local tribes lived far to the north-west of the rest of Mongolian world. At that time, the population living east of Lake Baikal (the Khori, most of whom had left the borders of eastern Mongolia a relatively short time previously, and the "Mungal" people of Khalkha Mongolian origin) were essentially uninvolved in this process of integration. As for the cultural level of Buryats, they were first in the USSR in levels of formal education, something we attribute to the Buryats' ethnic specificity. In traditional Buryat culture spiritual wealth (education, wisdom) is primary among the hierarchy of values. It is reflected in the "popu lar"-e ven nowadays-proverb: adag bayan-aduuha mal , dunda bayan-edir za lu, erkhim bayan-erdem belig ("cattle is not real wealth, youth is medium wealth, the best wealth is education"). 8 It is necessary to underline that today among the communities forming the Buryat people, the Buryats from Inner Mongolia, in particular, are a group with a high level of conservation of their traditional ethnic cultural institutions. To illustrating this break in continuity of traditions one can point out that all Buryat Buddhist temples that existed in 1930 were closed and most of religious cult items were destroyed. Authorities officially restricted and persecuted such important for Buryat traditional culture ceremonial and festive complexes as the oboo cult and the Lunar New Year celebration sagaalgan. 10 "To preserve our language and ethnos we, the Buryat- Mongols, must establish relations with all Mongols in the world, primarily with the neighboring state Mongolia, and with the International World Association of Mongols and maintain many-sided relations with them constantly" (Chimitdorzhiev 2001: 152). "It is necessary to understand that if we Buryats join the other Mongolian nations, we will save ourselves as Buryat-Mongolian ethnos with our own mother tongue and centuries-old culture" (Ibid.: 1 13). This phenomenon is expressed firstly in creating formal Buryat "communities," organized mostly on an administrative-territorial basis-divided into districts, which in a way reflects the family structure of Buryat society (this phenomenon can be characterized as a modern form of an organization based on family community relations). Secondly, it is reflected in works on the ethnic problem published during recent years, in which attention is focused on the necessity of recollecting genealogy, something typical of Buryat traditional culture, as well in general in the popularization in society of the traditional socio-cultural heritage. Thirdly, it is reflected in the daily forms of expressing ethnicity on an individual level. At the beginning of 1996 there were 19 organized "communities" (12 of them registered with the Ministry of Justice), in 1999 there were 25 communities, members of which originated from various parts of ethnic Buryatia, and there was also a community of Shenekhen (Inner Mongolian) Buryats. At the moment there</page><page sequence="32">32 Mongolian Studies XXVIII (2006) are 31 communities in the republic of Buryatia, in addition to some Buryat communities in other Russian regions and in countries of the Commonwealth of Independent Countries (former USSR). There is quite a large number of Buryats living in these communities, e.g. in St. Petersburg, Kiev, Moscow, Irkutsk, and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). 1 In practice neither the initiatives of the parties or the Buryat national movements had a logical aim. 13 Several Buryat historical compositions have a legend about the common origin of all Buryats or at least part of them. According to Ts.B. Tsydendambaev such legends surely cannot be taken as Buryat history. In this respect we should note that a number of chroniclers, belonging to different Buryat groups influenced each other when they describe events important for all the Buryats. It is true that, as S.B. Chimitdorzhiev wrote, "If we look at all these sources we will discover that all of them are history of Buryat local groups" ( niutag niutagai buriaaduudai tüükhe bolono). There is no "united" common history of all Buryats embracing all their tribes and families. A common history of the Buryats was not written because in the 18th and 19th centuries the Buryats still lived in quite isolated family tribal groups. Yet at the same time studying the histories of the Buryat local groups (Selenge, Khori, Barguzin Buryats) one can find common approaches and viewpoints concerning many issues. We agree with Tsydendambaev on this point. To prove the described above position of the chroniclers let us give an abstract of the work of Vandan Yumsunov, author of the chronicle "History of the Origin of the Eleven Khori Clans": After that, Russian peasants misappropriated many Khori people's lands. Some of the lands had been disputed for a long time; as for the extra lands (apart from the above-mentioned 105 dessiatinas of lands) located along the Ingoda River and various tributaries, they were to remain the Khori people's property. Despite this, peasants and other Russians, and Cossacks appropriated these lands and forced the Buryats to move to other places. We think it important to find all the documents dealing with land issues and all orders of higher authorities, because the successful existence of a nation depends on the land. They must not lose the right to hold land freely" (page 8). 15 After the Buryats joined Russia, their administrative and economic management was based upon the clan-tribal organization, which helped preserve the traditional structure of Buryat society until the beginning of the 20th century. 16 Tsar authorities used clan tribal structure to gather the yasak (tribute), taxes and other payments and to control fulfillment of obligations. After signing the Burinsk agreement in 1727, the Buryat population was governed according to The Instructions for Frontier Patrols made by Sawa B. Raguzinsky and published on June 26, 1728. One of the articles of the Instructions said that all Buryats were to belong to some definite clan and it was impossible for them "to change" their clan. In 1822 the Tsarist government adopted the instructions for Ruling the Siberian Provinces and Regulations for Administering Aliens. The regulations established clan family governance as the basic administrative organization heading a nomad camp, ulus, that consisted of not less than fifteen families. If several clans or nomad camps, uluses , were not located too far away from each other, they were united to form one community with a higher governance-the</page><page sequence="33">Boronoyeva 33 "alien authority." In the same way, Steppe Dumas were usually founded for many clans united by a common governance. 17 For instance, V. Yumsunov "History of the Origin of the Eleven Khori Clans," D. Gempilon "History of the Podgorodnyi Clan," Budazhap Budaev "History of the Six Selenge Clans," and others. These are the Atagan, Sartuul, Tabangut, Olzon, Tsongool, Khatagin, Podgorodno, Ashibagat. Alagui, Kharanuud, Gotol-Buumal, Baabai-Khurumshi, Olzon, Shono (Black- Miners). 20 According to some variants of the legends, Khoridai Mergen, a mythical forefather of Khori Buryats, had three wives. His first wife Bargazhan-Goa gave birth to their daughter Alan-Goa, the second wife, named Sharaldai, gave birth to five sons, the third wife, named Nagatai, gave birth to eight sons. In the chapter on land rights in his chronicle, V. Yumsunov underlines the moment of the Khori people's return, which conforms to historical reality: " After coming back from Mongolia the Khori people were roaming in the southern part of Lake Baikal, in Kudarinsk Steppe, up the Selenge River, along both of its shores, along the rivers Anna, Uda, Kurba, Khilok, Vitim and around the lakes Eravna, Khorgo, Isenge, Arkhirey, Asksa. They also roamed in the territory of present Mongolia. Nevertheless, most of us had nomad camps along the Selenge River" (BTB 1992: 72; BL 1995: 75; emphasis added) Shildei-zangi was the last bearer of the title of zangi among the Khori Buryats, which was used to designate the main person of all Khori peoples. According to V. Yumsunov's chronicle, this position was traditionally held by a representative of the Galzuud clan, which was considered to be the "oldest" among all eleven clans. "Our main noyon Shildei-zangi from the Zhankhan khükhüür of the Galzuud clan who was our last zangi-noyon , roamed in present Mongolia, not far from the Kherlen River. Meanwhile frontier signs were established between the two empires, and being left behind there, and no longer able come here and join us, such a title was cancelled among us" (BL 1995: 68; BTB 1992: 63). In our opinion, no frontier could coincide completely with the quite amorphous and changeable limits of nomadic people's campgrounds. As a rule, any demarcation by states of neighboring territories is followed by migrations of the people living in the regions next to the frontier. We are here considering only those territorial units of the Buryats which are mentioned in the written chronicles. As was mentioned above, Cisbaikal immigrants were traditionally called representatives of the zurgaan esege "the six clans" (or literally "the six fathers"). D.D. Nimaev thinks that this tradition originated with the authors of the first chronicles (Nimaev, 2000: 167). As is well-known, these six clans represented administrative-territorial units that included representatives of not only of the "six clans" but also of practically all basic tribal unions found among the western Buryats. As mentioned before, in the chronicles the Mongolian immigrants were traditionally called the baruun naiman "the western eight." It should be noted that this eight includes Ashibagats that came from Cisbaikalia. The reason for this misunderstanding is that the Ashibagats left Cisbaikalia for Mongolia in the</page><page sequence="34">34 Mongolian Studies XXVIII (2006) 1650's during the mass exodus of western Buryats caused by abuses associated with the name of Peter Pokhabov, who was the head of Bratsk fort and who they called "Bagaaba Khan." Twenty-six years later they returned due to the military incursions of Galdan-Boshugtu in Mongolia. After their return, they settled down in Transbaikalia. For some unknown reason, the Ashibagats' pre-Baikal past is "hidden" in the Selenge Buryat chronicles. Moreover, they say when the Ashibagats came from Mongolia to Irkutsk fort, they were granted lands and moved to Transbaikalia, while some of them stayed in Cisbaikalia. As Ts.B. Tsydendambaev points out, this story implies that "pre-Baikal Ashibagats were a splinter of those Ashibagats who came from Mongolia" (Tsydendambaev 2001: 182). In this case, we find it most important to underline the migration activity, using an example of the Ashibagats, which was caused by the beginning of colonization in the territories where the Buryat tribes were settled. The notion of "ethnic group" used here is a synonym of the notions of natsiya "nation" (in its ethnic cultural meaning), ethnic community (« ethnos ) or narod "nation" which are used more widely used in Russian literature. Here we would like to mention that in one of the Barguzin Buryat chronicles discussing the pre-Russian Buriats uses the phrase yohoto buriaaduud "real, original Buryats" ( BTB 1992: 163), to mean the Bulagat and Ekhirit. 29 As we can see, in this new self-designation there are several levels of integration simultaneously: clan, tribal, supra-tribal, which means that realization of any belonging to the whole (e.g. to the Buryats) is made through a belonging to the particular (e.g. Khori, eleven clans). It should be mentioned that in the chronicles there are different versions of these legends and myths. A thorough analysis of existing versions of ethno- genetic myths led T.D. Skrynnikova to conclude that they show the following tendencies: 1) intra-Buryat differentiation: different origins, different totem forefathers (burbot for the Ekhirit, bull for the Bulagat and swan for the Khori); and 2) ethnic integration, in which anthropomorphic forefathers are given the same origin, from a single pair: a bull (Bukha-noyon) and female-shaman Aisukhan (Skrynnikova, 2003: 77). 31 Khorin zon "Khori people" (BTB 1992: 15); Khoriin arban negen otogoi zon "people of the eleven Khori clans" ( BTB 1995: 14); Khoriin otoguud "Khori clans" (BTB 1992: 15). 32 See these quotations from T. Toboev's chronicle: "According to the idea of some believers in the shamans, they say that in a distant time when the Buryat people ( Buriaad zon) did not have the religion of the Buddha , then the tengeri (gods) took pity upon them and gave them rules by which male shamans (böö) and female shamans ( udagan ) could appear, within human powers. Some people say that when the Buryat people ( Buriaad zon) did not have the religion of Buddha , then the dishonest people gave them rules by which they would make people respect them, frighten people and so get profits from them" (BTB 1992: 19-20; BL 1995: 14, emphasis added); and ". . . the Buryat people some time later built a hermitage in the place called Tsugol (Süügeí). With the name of the monastery being Dashi Choinpilling and its protector-deity being Choizhal, this monastery became a center of the Buddhist religion and with great benefit to living beings ..." (BTB 1992: 30; BL 1995: 27).</page><page sequence="35">Boronoyeva 35 33 We believe that T.D. Skrynnikova's viewpoint that "V. Yumsunov used the ethnonym khoriin buriaad just once, when he spoke about how the Khori people joined the Buryats" does not conform to the content of V. Yumsunov's chronicle. 34 In 1804, 105,000 dessiatinas of lands along the Ingoda River that had belonged to the Khori were given to Russian migrants. "... Since the 18* and 19* centuries, the Russian-speaking ethnic component has been dominant. The all-Union census of 1897 showed a further increase in the percentage of aliens: in Irkutsk province and the eastern Baikal region, 69% were Russians and 24% were Buryats" (Nimaev, 2000: 176). 36 Dolsamdorzhi Gempilon was his nephew. That is why we can say that the events described took place in the daylight of history, since the participants and witnesses of the events were still alive. 37 Here let us just give a brief citation from T.D. Skrynnikova's work: "T. Toboev underlines the common character of the Khori and Mongolian people, beginning his chronicle with the phrase: "They [the Khori and Aga Buryats-T.S.] separated from Mongolian world" ( BL 1995: 5). It is underlined that Khoridoi was the younger son of Bargu Baatur (the daichin noyon of two Mongolian Tümets) {Ibid.). This information inspires the subsequent documentation of the ethno- genetic closeness between the Khori and the Mongolian people. V. Yumsunov continues this theme, telling us about Chinggis Khan's biography (the 12th generation after Börte Chino), about his descendant Ligdan-khan, who married his daughter Balzhan to Dai Khung-Taiji, a son of the Solongut Bubei-beile-baatur, who moved to Nerchinsk region in 1594 as T. Toboev says ( BL 1995: 6) or in 1613 as V. Yumsunov says (Ibid.: 38). Eleven Khori clans were Balzhan's dowry." (Skrynnikova, 1999: 10). 8 In this case we cannot judge whether these ideas conform to historical reality or not. For us it is more important that such ideas existed in Barguzin Buryat society and were reflected in the chronicles. It is interesting that in the chronicle visible traces are cited of their former presence in Barguzin: "Because this people were nomadic and had felt tents, they left without leaving traces of houses. But they say that the channels for bringing water from mountain streams, the traces of the fields which were in use a long time ago, the bronze implements and arrow heads and such are from the Khorchin" (BTB 1992: ' 62; BL 1995: 178-179). Yet it is worth mentioning that the ethnonyms buriaad-mongol , and mongol - buriaad can be also found in the Khori chronicles, as, for example, in S.N. Khobituev's work (BTB, 1992: 100,102). The most well-known and familiar examples are "Khalkha Mongol," "Oirad Mongol," "Chakhar Mongol," "Ordos Mongol" and so on. Of course we intend this statement to apply only to those chronicles within this article's scope. In this case, the term buriaad-mongolnuud is used to name all the Selenge Buryats. A well-known Russian scholar N.L. Zhukovskaia believes that today one opportunity for the realization of the Buryat national idea lies in the renaissance of Buddhism, because under those conditions Buryatia could enter the Buddhist Asian-Pacific region as a region within the Buddhist world (Zhukovskaia 2000: 21).</page><page sequence="36">36 Mongolian Studies XXVIII (2006) 44 In 1914 there were thirty-six datsans with sixteen thousand lamas in Buryatia. 45 Christianity touched mostly Buryats living in the west Baikal regions. 46 Let us give some citations from the Buryat chronicles, which show the Buryats' perception of orthodox religion in the context of the opposition "native-alien": "Gathering the people that here and there among the Khori Buryats had voluntarily donned the cross and entered the Christian religion, a settlement was created in Totkhoto in Khilok. A head was appointed for the 160 people, and in 1795 they were made separate. In 1826 in accordance with their own wishes, they were separated from the Khori jurisdiction and were included in the Kunaleisk local administration" ( BTB 1992: 17; BL 1995: 11). "Some persons from the people of the clans under Khori jurisdiction donned the cross and began to live according to Russian customs, built Russian houses, and sedentarized. In the five settlements, Khilok's Totkhoto, Old and New Zardama, in Kurba-Unegetei and Ara-Khasurta, they led a settled life . . . After 1815, 207 people from the last two settlements and from Il'insk, Khukhe-Khonituisk and present-day Usť- Tashelansk were separated from Khori clans and started living separately as the Kurbinsk community. . . . Aside from them other people have later also donned the cross, some of whom are considered settled while the others are nomadic. There are still people who have donned the cross among the people of the eleven Khori clans" ( BTB 1992: 39; BL 1995: 40-41).</page><page sequence="37">BORONOYEVA 37 Buryat chronicles used in the work: A.
