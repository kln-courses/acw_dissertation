<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Deism, Christianity, and the Age of Reason1 Donald Wayne Viney / Pittsburg State University Where religion is concerned, the best and most lasting contribution of America's founders was arguably more political than theological. They brought to fruition the idea of religious freedom. To be sure, this concept had already been articulated and underwent important develop ments prior to the eighteenth century.2 The Americans, however, began to make it a reality in the sphere of public life. This is nowhere more evident than in the Constitution of the United States and in the first article of the Bill of Rights. Nevertheless, some of the founders had a great deal to say on theological topics, and it is this aspect of their thinking on which I focus in this paper. Some of the founders were orthodox Christians, but where religious liberty was concerned, it was deistic philosophy more than Christianity per se that informed their ideas about the laws that would regulate the new nation.31 examine the views of Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790), Thomas Paine (1737-1809), and Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) as representative of the American version of what David L. Holmes calls "the Deist spectrum."4 Although two of these founders were nominally Christian, all of them sought to deprive Christianity of a privileged status in political life through their criticisms of specifically Christian articles of faith. More than this, they viewed deism as the theology most consonant with reason. Jefferson went further and hoped that religious liberty would lead to the triumph of deistic and Unitarian ideas. I conclude the paper with some 1.1 dedicate this paper to the memory of Dr. Ronny E. Turner, formerly professor of Sociol ogy at Colorado State University.

I. Enlightenment and the Deist Spectrum Immanuel Kant famously characterized enlightenment as "man's release from his self-incurred tutelage"?tutelage, that is to say, to the strictures of authority and tradition. According to Kant, the motto of enlightenment is "Have courage to use your own reason."5 The enthusiasm for reason as the crowning glory of human beings is why Enlightenment thinkers viewed themselves as living in the Age of Reason, in contrast to previous ages, especially the medieval, which was characterized, and caricatured, as "The Dark Ages." Thus, Voltaire spoke of "those times of darkness and ignorance, which we distinguish by the name of the Middle Ages . . ."6 For Enlightenment thinkers, the unfettered use of reason included the promise of solving personal, intellectual, social, political, and spiritual problems. Applied to the political sphere it implied the end of tyranny and the birth of freedom. Voltaire's twin injunctions, "Osez penser par vous-m?me" (Dare to think for yourself) and "?crasez l'inf?me" (Crush infamy) encapsulate both the appeal to the individual's power of reason and the political implications of enlightenment thinking.7 When it came to the subject of religion, there was no single Enlightenment view, but the claims of revelation were increasingly subject to scrutiny, skepti cism, and denial. Some of those in France like the priest Jean Meslier and the philosophes Denis Diderot, Jean D'Alembert, and Baron d'Holbach were athe ists. Most thinking people, however, remained broadly theistic and they con tinued to attach importance to Jesus if only as a moral sage. If theism survived the scrutiny of reason, the Bible did not. Increasingly, philosophers accepted Spinoza's judgment in A Theologico-Political Treatise that the Bible is to be treated no differently than any other book. Its authors were human, and so can be judged as other human authors; its claims are hypotheses, to be tested against the best available evidence. This approach to Scripture is clearly evident in Emilie du Ch?telet's Examen de la Gen?se, a merciless attack on the idea that the Bible 5.

Whereas Voltaire continually questioned revelation, he remained deferential to Jesus and the morality that he believed Jesus taught. Thus, Enlightenment de ism was born, combining a belief in God with a profound skepticism about the deliverances of revealed religion. The Enlightenment "deist spectrum," then, includes anyone who, using only reason, accepts the existence of God and denies revealed religion.9 If Thomas Aquinas could argue that propositions taken on faith must be provably not contrary to reason, the Enlightenment thinkers in creasingly proclaimed that the propositions taken on faith are provably contrary to reason.10 Let us turn to the American incarnations of these deistic ideas. II. Benjamin Franklin In his Autobiography, Franklin recounts his conversion to deism when he was a youth. "I was scarce fifteen when, after doubting by turns of several points, as I found them disputed in the different books I read, I began to doubt of Revelation itself. Some books against Deism fell into my hands; they were said to be the substance of sermons preached at Boyle's Lectures. It happened that they wrought an effect on me quite contrary to what was intended by them; for the arguments of the Deists, which were quoted to be refuted, appeared to me much stronger than the refutations; in short, I soon became a thorough Deist."11 Four years later, while living in London, Franklin published an es say titled A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain (1725) in which he argued, in nondeistic fashion, that because a perfect God determines all that occurs, nothing could possibly be wrong in the world, there is no free 8. Redman, Portable Voltaire, 23. 9. According to William L. Reese's Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion, Eastern and West ern Thought, 2nd ed. (New York: Humanities Press, 1996), the word "deist" was introduced by the Socinians in the sixteenth century to distinguish their views from theism and atheism. Today it is more common to associate deism with the thinkers of the early modern period, beginning with Herbert of Cherbury. 10. Locke and Leibniz are exceptions. Locke argued that belief in prophecy and miracles is above reason, but not contrary to reason. See John Locke, The Reasonableness of Christianity, ed. LT Ramsey (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1958). Leibniz also embraced this distinction, employing it much as Aquinas had done. See Gottfried Leibniz, Theodicy, trans. E. M. Huggard, ed. Austin Farrer (La Salle, IL: Open Court, 1985), 88, para. 23. 11. Benjamin Franklin, The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (New York: Collier, 1962), 61.</page><page sequence="4">86 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy will, and vice and virtue are empty distinctions. He says in the autobiography that he came to suspect something was wrong with this line of reasoning. He continued, however, to place no credence in any putative revealed truth that did not agree with reason. Franklin also argued against the divine command theory of morality, al though he did not know it by that name. "Revelation indeed had no weight with me, as such; but I entertain'd an opinion that, though certain actions might not be bad because they were forbidden by it, or good because it commanded them, yet probably these actions might be forbidden because they were bad for us, or commanded because they were beneficial to us, in their own natures, all the circumstances of things considered."12 Franklin's point can be paraphrased by saying that God commands things because they are good; they are not good because God commands them; also, God forbids things because they are bad; they are not bad because God forbids them. The idea that moral commands are true (or false) independent of the will of God was first clearly put forward in Plato's Euthyphro, but Franklin seems not to have known this source. Frank lin reports that he became acquainted with the Socratic method, not through reading Plato but through reading Xenophon's Memorable Things of Socrates. He apparently made as much a nuisance of himself as Socrates had done in ancient Athens, taking great delight in luring people into their own webs of contradiction. He says, "my indiscrete disputations about religion began to make me pointed at with horror by good people as an infidel or atheist."13 Franklin remained a deist throughout his life, but he never ceased contem plating matters of religion. Late in life, in 1790, he wrote a letter to Ezra Stiles outlining his beliefs on religious questions. There he reaffirms his belief in a God who created the universe and governs it by providence. He also identifies service to God with doing good to others. He expresses belief in an afterlife in which one's deeds will be rewarded or punished. Finally, he praises Jesus's ethics as "the best the world ever saw or is likely to see," but he withholds belief in the divinity of Christ.14 An idiosyncrasy of Franklin's religion, which he developed as a young man, was a belief in numerous lesser deities. On November 20, 1728, he articulated this polytheism quite clearly. The one Infinite God, he speculated, is beyond human comprehension, and neither expects nor requires any worship from us. According to Franklin, to suppose this God to be in need of praise would be 12. Ibid., 62. 13. Ibid., 27 and 31. 14. Nathan G. Goodman, ed., A Benjamin Franklin Reader (New York: Thomas Y Crowell Company, 1945), 244.</page><page sequence="5">Volume 31, No. 2, May 2010 87 like supposing a wise man to desire praise from an ignorant man. This God created many lesser gods, each of which is associated with a particular star or planetary system. Franklin says, "It is that particular wise and good God, who is the author and owner of our system, that I propose for the object of my praise and adoration."15 Franklin says that this local deity may or may not be immortal, but it is very long-lived, and it has implanted in humans the same passion and capacity for reason that is in itself. Alfred Owen Aldridge claims that polytheism "remained a strong and abiding idea with Franklin, not merely a juvenile notion, for he repeated it in subsequent periods of his life."16 Aldridge's judgment must be balanced against the facts that Franklin's explicit statement of polytheism was written at the age of twenty-two and that his mature belief at age eighty-four, in the letter to Stiles, mentions only the belief in one God to whom worship is due. Despite Franklin's skepticism about Christian doctrine, he attended church, first as a Presbyterian and later as an Anglican, but always as a deist. While in the Presbyterian congregation he became bored with a minister who enjoyed sermonizing on the dogmas of the faith, so he stopped going to church. A little later he again attended church because of a junior pastor, Samuel Hemphill, who delivered brilliant sermons on virtue and morality. A controversy erupted when it was discovered that Hemphill plagiarized his sermons. Franklin was willing to turn a sideward glance at the fault of plagiarism because of the ethi cal values he found in the sermons he delivered?an ironic defense, to say the least. He supported Hemphill and wrote scathing attacks on his detractors. In the best tradition of Voltaire he composed a mock syllogism concerning their arguments: "Asses are grave and dull animals. Our Authors [those who attack Hemphill] are grave and dull animals. Therefore, Our Authors are ... if you will, Rev. Asses." Franklin concluded, "This reasoning is every whit as conclusive, and as infallibly just as theirs."17 Of course, Franklin knows that his argument is fallacious, an example of the fallacy of undistributed middle. It is analogous to arguing that all dogs are animals; all cats are animals; therefore, all cats are dogs. Franklin's defense of Hemphill is consistent with the words he wrote to his mother when she expressed concern that he might be an Arian, that is to say, a Unitarian, "I think that vital Religion has always suffer'd, when Orthodoxy is more regarded than Virtue."18 15.

Quoted in Aldridge, Benjamin Franklin, 99.</page><page sequence="6">88 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy Franklin stressed the inability of reason to proceed much further on religious questions than what he himself believed. He argued that it takes a great deal of boldness to assert that all of the doctrines of one's own religion are true and other religions are true only insofar as they are in agreement with one's own. Such people (who in the America of Franklin's day were mostly Protes tant) "assume to themselves that Infallibility which they deny to the Popes and Councils."19 Like Montaigne and Voltaire before him, Franklin found religious dogma a poor foundation for a system of civil punishments and rewards. He said that when Scripture and reason conflict, one should side with reason.20 III. Thomas Paine Among all of the American deists, the most strident in his rejection of Chris tianity was Thomas Paine. His book, The Age of Reason, published in two parts, in 1794 and 1795, is a frank and unapologetic dismissal of Christianity. Nevertheless, Paine's positive beliefs are remarkably close to those of Franklin: belief in God; hope for happiness beyond this life; belief in the equality of man; and belief that religious duties involve doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow creatures happy. Paine speaks unambiguously of how these things are known: "It is only by the exercise of reason that man can discover God."21 Paine ridicules the claim that the Bible is divinely inspired. Divine revela tion, God's word, is not found written in any human language where there are the possibilities of misunderstanding, mistranslation, and corruption of the text. The only word of God that Paine recognizes is nature itself: "In fine, do we want to know what God is? Search not the book called Scripture, which any human hand might make, but the Scripture called Creation."22 We should study trigonometry, astronomy, navigation, geometry, architecture, and all mathematical demonstration so that we can know and imitate our creator.23 Paine calls God the "The Almighty Lecturer" who displays scientific principles in the very structure of the universe.24 University professors may be especially appreciative of Paine's metaphor. Paine's strongest words are reserved for his negative apologetics aimed at 19. Quoted in Ibid., 99. 20. Ibid., 97. 21. Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, (Buffalo, NY: Prometheus Books, 1984), 33. 22.

He condemns the study of ancient languages as a Christian surrogate for the study of nature. According to Paine, "the age of ignorance commenced with the Christian system." The ancients?by which Paine seems to mean, the Greeks?were on their way to developing modern ideas about science, but "the Christian system laid all waste." Paine's antipathy for Christianity does not extend to Jesus. He describes Jesus as a "virtuous and amiable man" whose "great trait" of character was philanthropy. Echoing the views made famous by Voltaire, Paine says, "the Church has set up a system of religion very contradic tory to the character of the person whose name it bears."25 Paine tells us that when he wrote Part I of The Age of Reason, he had no Bible before him and was obliged to argue from memory. A year later, however, he procured a Bible and Part II was published with a detailed critique of the claim that the Bible is divinely inspired. Perhaps because he did not have a Bible when he wrote Part I, Paine relied heavily on an a priori argument against revelation. He defines revelation as "something communicated immediately from God to man." If the person to whom the revelation comes communicates it to others, it is not, for them, a revelation from God but mere hearsay.26 According to this reasoning, the Bible cannot be considered as a genuine revelation except to those to whom it was immediately communicated. Paine concludes that the Bible "is not the word of God." The only way in which a person other than an author of Scripture could accept the Bible as revelation is if God revealed to him or her that the Bible is the revealed word of God.27 Although he concedes the possibility of revelation, Paine denies that any of the Bible's authors were inspired as the Church teaches. In Part II Paine argues that the evidence is against believing that the hearsay of Scripture was originally inspired by God. He proceeds, book by book, from Genesis to Revelation, outlining his objections. Part II fills in the details for claims that were made in Part I. Paine seems not to realize that his case against revelation commits him to a modal contradiction. The conclusion of the a priori argument is that an individual can believe that the Bible is revealed only if God reveals to that individual that it is. The argument of Part II, however, presupposes that an honest investigation of Scripture will reveal whether or not it is the inspired word of God. Of course, Paine comes to the negative conclusion. But he must concede the possibility of a verdict in favor of Scripture if his investigation is not to be an elaborate begging of the question. To concede the possibility of a positive verdict it is necessary to abandon the a priori argument. 25. Quotes in this paragraph: Ibid., 46, 47, 16 and 26, 28. 26. Ibid., 9-10. 27. Ibid., 19 and 178-79.</page><page sequence="8">90 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy Paine anticipates the argument of Part II when, in Part I, he reasons that it is impious to believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God. Sounding remarkably like the "new atheists" of our own day, Paine says: "Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and tortur ous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness, with which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we called it the word of demon, than the word of God. It is a history of wickedness, that has served to cor rupt and brutalize mankind; and, for my part, I sincerely detest it, as I detest everything that is cruel."28 In Part II, Paine is able to fill in the argument with examples. For instance, Paine asks whether it is consistent with the character of a benevolent God to countenance Moses's order to his troops "to butcher the boys, to massacre the mothers, and debauch the daughters" of Midian as related in Numbers 31:13-18. The slaughter continues in the book of Joshua as the children of Israel wage a genocidal war against the inhabitants of Ca naan. Or again, is it fitting for a prophet of God to unleash two she-bears to maul forty-two ornery children who made fun of his baldness, as related in II Kings 2:23-24? Paine comments on the violence of the Bible's stories and its heroes: "The cruelties that the Jews had accustomed themselves to practice on the Canaanites, whose country they had savagely invaded under a pretended gift from God, they afterward practiced as furiously on each other."29 In addition to his moral critique of Scripture, Paine raises objections to the authority of Scripture that today are common knowledge in seminaries. For example, he examines the textual evidence for the claim that Moses wrote the Torah. As evidence for a date of composition after Moses, he points to the frequent use of the expression "to this day," the use of the third person to refer to Moses, and the account of Moses's death and burial. Or again, Paine notes the numerical confusions and inconsistencies between Ezra and Nehemiah. Paine's discussion has a modern sound when he argues that the latter part of Isaiah chapter 44 and the beginning of chapter 45 could not have been written by the same person?of course, modern scholars speak of Deutero-Isaiah (i.e. second Isaiah) to mark this distinction. Paine points out the contradictory gene alogies of Jesus and the various contrary accounts of his life and ministry that appear in the New Testament. He also remarks on the curious use of Hebrew 28.

About the book of Revelation, Paine says only (in Part I), it "is a book of riddles that requires a revelation to explain it."30 In a word, Paine anticipates many of the questions that gave rise to modern biblical scholarship. What he was unable to foresee was the flexibility of the Jewish and Christian religions in being able to incorporate this liberal approach to the Bible, even to the extent of seeing it as integral to responsible exegesis. From Paine's point of view, the Bible has nothing to recommend it, whether as good literature or as revealed truth. He acknowledges that there are "frag ments of morality that are irregularly and thinly scattered" throughout the Bible.31 However, he maintains that these are not revealed truths, but truths known to every creature with a conscience. In many cases, he says, the ancients were nearer the truth about morality than the writers of the Bible. He praises Solon, legendary founder of Athens, for identifying the foundation of political morality, "where the least injury done to the meanest individual, is considered as an insult on the whole constitution. "32 Interestingly, Paine does not share the typical deistic enthusiasm for the morality of Jesus. Paine calls loving one's enemies a "dogma of feigned morality" without meaning. At best, it is a vol untary act and not a duty.33 Lest anyone suppose that Paine himself was a bad person because he disowns this element of Jesus's moral teaching, he interjects that he never persecuted any man or set of men, and that he never returned evil for evil. IV. Thomas Jefferson As Jefferson approached the end of his life, he asked that posterity remember him for three things: as the author of the Declaration of Independence, as the author of the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom, and as the father of the University of Virginia. The Virginia statute on religious freedom was drafted in 1777 and adopted with some modifications in 1786. The statute says that "our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions, any more than our opinions in physics or geometry."34 It guarantees each man freedom 30. Ibid., 18. 31.

No one should be compelled to "frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry .. ,"35 The words of the Virginia Statute prefigure Jefferson's most famous remark about church and state relations which he made in his letter of January 1,1802, to The Danbury Baptist Association: "Believing with you that religion is a mat ter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legislative powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between Church and State."36 The quote is, of course, from Article 1 of the Bill of Rights, amended to the Constitution June 15,1790. The expression "wall of separation between Church and State" reflects Jefferson's opinion that God chose to propagate correct opinion and belief, not by coercion, "but to extend it by its influence on reason."37 Jean Yarbrough notes that Jefferson's wall of separation between church and state "is specifically intended to apply only to the federal government."38 The Virginia Statute demonstrates that Jefferson did not approve of churches established by the states, but he grudgingly agreed to them. He was hopeful that, with proper instruction, the states would adopt the federal viewpoint for their own limited jurisdictions. Nine of the original thirteen colonies had established religions.39 The process of disestablishment in the states began with the Virginia Statute and ended when Connecticut, in 1829, and Massachusetts, in 1833, disestablished religion. The main factor motivating the Virginia Statute?a similar argument can be made for Madison in the case of the first amendment?was Jefferson's knowledge of the mischief done in the name of religion. "It is the specula tions of the theologists [sic] which have made a Babel" of religion, causing 35. Last two quotes, Ibid., 253. 36. Ibid., 303. 37. Ibid., 251. 38. Jean M.

However, he followed Voltaire and went further than Locke in extending toleration to atheists, and even to those with philosophies that seem contrary to republican government. For example, he believed that the Jesuits, as a group, merited eternal perdition. He worried that they would establish themselves in the United States as they had in Russia. Yet, he wrote to Adams on May 6, 1816, "Our system ... of religious liberty must afford them an asylum. But if they do not put the purity of our elections to a severe trial, it will be a wonder."41 In the final analysis, Jefferson's only requirement for the protection of religious freedom is that those protected would tolerate others: "Perhaps the single thing which may be required to others before toleration to them would be an oath that they would allow toleration to others."42 Jefferson's theological views were indebted to his reading of Pierre Gassendi's work on Epicurus. Following Epicurus, he rejected belief in spiritual substances. "To talk of immaterial existence," he wrote to John Adams on August 15,1820, "is to talk of nothings. "43 In the same letter, he not only embraces the implication that souls, angels, and gods cannot be immaterial, but he speaks of immaterial ism as a heresy and as "masked atheism." Oddly enough, Jefferson did not insist on the doctrine of the eternity of matter, although this is required if materialism is true and if God is eternal. He argued, nevertheless, that the eternity of matter does not imply the nonexistence of God. He mentions atheists?among whom he includes Spinoza, Diderot, and D'Holbach?who reason that it is simpler to posit an everlasting chain of cause and effect without God than the same causal chain with God. For Jefferson, on the contrary, the vast regularities of nature give an overpowering conviction of design. Again, to Adams, on April 11,1823, he wrote: "[It] is impossible, I say, for the human mind not to believe that there is, in all this, design, cause and effect, up to an ultimate cause, a fabricator of all things from matter and motion, their preserver and regulator while permit ted to exist in their present forms, and their regenerator into new and other forms."44 Thus, it was less a cosmologica! argument from effect to cause that 40.

Jefferson's deism, unlike that of Franklin and Paine, did not include belief in life after death. Jefferson accepted the materialist idea of death as the complete annihilation of consciousness. It was not death that gave Jefferson anxiety but living too long with enfeebled powers and outliving one's friends. In 1801 he wrote, "My health has been always so uniformly firm, that I have for some years dreaded nothing so much as the living too long."45 He shared the same senti ment with Benjamin Waterhouse on January 8, 1825: "The most undesirable of all things is long life: and there is nothing I have ever so much dreaded."46 Adding to the argument, he wrote to Francis Adrian Van der Kemp three days later, "The solitude in which we are left by the death of our friends is one of the great evils of life." Of death, Jefferson wrote, "Come when it will, it will find me neither unready nor unwilling."47 Jefferson's attitudes about reason and its relation to religion were heavily deistic and Unitarian. In a letter dated July 19,1822, Jefferson told Waterhouse that he greatly admired the Unitarian minister Joseph Priestly and, while living in Philadelphia, he attended regular services of the Unitarian fellowship where Priestly often officiated.48 Three years later, in another letter to Waterhouse (quoted above), he declared himself to be a Unitarian.49 Reason, not revelation, was the only guide he recognized. In 1787, from Paris, he wrote a letter of advice to Peter Carr, his nephew and ward. "Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call to her tribunal every fact, every opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of god; because, if there be one, he must more approve the homage of reason, than that of blind-folded fear."50 Jefferson gives the example of Joshua and the sun standing still (Joshua 10:12-14) and notes that if this story were told by the historians Livy or Tacitus it would be dismissed as untrue. Since the Bible writer is said to be inspired, one must candidly examine the evidence of his having been inspired. Jefferson also encourages the young man to ask whether Jesus was bora of a virgin, performed miracles, and ascended bodily into heaven, or whether his birth was illegitimate and whether he set out without pretensions to divinity, but ended by believing them, and was killed by the Romans.

Paine and Jefferson also shared disdain for the last book of the Bible, although the President was more forceful in his rejection of it. Alexander Smyth sent Jefferson four proof sheets of a book he was publishing on the subject and asked for his opinion. Jefferson responded on January 17,1825, that he read Revelation fifty or sixty years earlier and that his opinion of it had not changed, that it must be con sidered "as merely the ravings of a Maniac, no more worthy, nor capable of explanation than the incoherences of our own nightly dreams."52 He advised Smyth that his friend's time was too valuable and his understanding was of too high an order to be wasted on the paralogisms of the Apocalypse. While Jefferson cast a skeptical eye on any claim of revelation, his opinion about the man from Nazareth was that he was a great moral teacher whose doc trines were very imperfectly preserved in the Evangelists. He considered Jesus's first followers to have corrupted the Christian message by making up doctrines about his divinity and his miraculous powers. "Notwithstanding these disadvan tages, a system of morals is presented to us, which, if filled up in the style and spirit of the rich fragments he left us, would be the most perfect and sublime that has ever been taught by man."53 Jefferson's skepticism about orthodox Christi anity is evident, for he calls its doctrines "artificial systems." Among these are included "the immaculate conception of Jesus [sic], His deification, the creation of the world by Him, His miraculous powers, His resurrection and visible ascen sion, His corporeal presence in the Eucharist, the Trinity, original sin, atonement, regeneration, election, orders of Hierarchy, etc."54 The apostle Paul is mentioned especially as "the first great corruptor of the doctrines of Jesus."55 51.

The Immaculate Conception is the doctrine that Mary was born without the taint of original sin. The Virgin Birth is the doctrine that Mary had no sexual relations prior to Jesus's birth. On April 11, 1823, Jefferson wrote to John Adams, "And the day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the supreme being as his father in the womb of a virgin will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter" (Adams, Jefferson's Extracts, 412). Jefferson simply found the doctrine of the Trinity to be unintelligible Platonic mysticism, "that three are one, one is three; and yet that the one is not three, and the three are not one" (Ford, Writings of Thomas Jefferson, 9: 412) 55.

In the April 23,1823, letter to John Adams, Jefferson quotes the first three lines of John's Gospel, in Greek, and provides his own translation: "In the beginning God existed, and reason [or mind] was with God, and the mind was God. This was in the beginning with God. All things were created by it, and without it was made not one thing which was made." Jefferson explains: "Yet this text, so plainly declaring the doctrine of Jesus that the world was created by the supreme, intelligent being, has been perverted by modern Christians to build up a second person of their tritheism by a mistranslation of the word , One of it's [sic] legitimate meanings indeed is 'a word.' But, in that sense, it makes an unmeaning jargon: while the other meaning 'reason,' equally legitimate, explains rationally the eternal pr?existence of God, and his creation of the world."57 Jefferson will not allow John's prologue, as a whole, to stand as a statement of the Evangelist's own faith. He doubtless viewed verse 14 of the prologue?"And the became flesh and dwelt among us ... the only Son of the Father"?as another instance of substituting a doctrine about Jesus for a doctrine of Jesus. Jefferson's interest in the moral teachings of Jesus and his disinterest in Chris tology is most clearly apparent in his excerpts from the Gospels, a work that has come to be called the Jefferson Bible. On October 31, 1819, Jefferson wrote to William Short that he had sometimes thought of creating a little book of his own, using extracts from the Gospels. "[It would be] an abstract from the Evangelists of whatever has the stamp of the eloquence and fine imagination of Jesus. The last I attempted too hastily some twelve or fifteen years ago. It was the work of two or three nights only, at Washington, after getting through the evening task of reading the letters and papers of the day. But with one foot in the grave, these are now idle projects for me."58 F. Forrester Church argues that this letter refers to a little book Jefferson created in 1804 called The Philosophy of Jesus. In 1820, Church maintains, Jefferson returned to this "idle project" and created The Life &amp; Morals of Jesus of Nazareth, also known as The Jefferson Bible.59 56.

He cut verses and sections from the four Gospels which he deemed the authentic teachings of Jesus and arranged them roughly in chronological order, pasting them into the blank pages of a leather book. The excerpts are pasted in parallel columns in the order, Greek, Latin, French, and English. Jefferson omits all miracle stories and references to Je sus's divinity. The book begins with Luke's account of Jesus's birth, minus any mention of the miraculous conception or angels singing; the book concludes with Jesus's crucifixion and burial. The Jefferson Bible perfectly illustrates Jefferson's views as told to Benjamin Rush in 1803. "I am a Christian, in the only sense in which [Jesus] wished any one to be; sincerely attached to his doc trines, in preference to all others; ascribing to himself every human excellence; and believing he never claimed any other."60 Thirteen years later, in a letter to Charles Thompson, Jefferson said of his Gospel extracts and of his own religion, "A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never seen; it is a document in proof that I am a real Christian, that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus .. ."61 The modern scholar will smile at Jefferson's audacity in imposing eighteenth-century standards of rationality and historicity upon a first-century document, with the pretense of discovering the kernels of truth in Jesus's life and thought. Nevertheless, the Jefferson Bible stands as the clearest possible illustration of typical deistic ideas about revealed religion and Jesus of Nazareth.62 V. Reason's Mite If being Christian means accepting specifically Christian doctrines, then Frank lin and Jefferson were, at best, nominally Christians. Paine sets all pretence aside and simply regards Christianity as the enemy of reason. Nevertheless, Paine speaks for all deists when he asks, "Is it not more safe that we stop our selves at the plain, pure, and unmixed belief of one God, which is Deism, than that we commit ourselves on an ocean of improbable, irrational, indecent and 60. Peterson, Portable Thomas Jefferson, 490. 61. Larson, Essence of Jefferson, 261. 62. As Jefferson distinguished the authentic teachings of Jesus from the distortions of them by the Evangelists, so he distinguished the teachings of Socrates from Plato's account of them. To William Short he wrote on August 4, 1820, "So again, the superlative wisdom of Socrates is testified by all antiquity, and placed on ground not to be questioned. When, therefore, Plato puts into his mouth such paralogisms, such quibbles on words, and sophisms, as a school boy would be ashamed of, we conclude they were the whimsies of Plato's own foggy brain, and acquit Socrates of puerilities so unlike his character."

It could purchase belief in the existence of God, knowledge of God's creation through science, understanding of moral truth through conscience, and the wisdom necessary for the just governing of society. We have also seen that deistic reason was critical of the Bible but permitted an appreciation of the moral genius of Jesus. It asks too much of these deists to have foreseen the inflation that caused reason to lose its purchasing power over their central idea that God exists. In their day the design argument for God's existence was, for most thinking people, a convincing proof. There were exceptions, however, and these exceptions became important in the fullness of time. In Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1779), Hume offered serious philosophical objections to the argument, but this was too late to influence the thinking of other eighteenth-century philosophers. In The Critique of Pure Reason (1781), Kant attempted to place the question of God's existence outside the competence of reason to prove one way or another. Again, this occurs late in the century. As the nineteenth century opened, William Paley made a forceful case for the design argument in Natural Theology (1802). Notwithstanding the counterarguments of Hume and Kant, it was enough to convince many thinkers, including the young Charles Darwin?so the deists were in good company. Throughout the first half of the nineteenth century, however, the scientific evidence embrittled a simple design argument. When Wallace, and most famously, Darwin, in Origin of Species (1859), provided an alternative explanation of the intricate complexities of biological systems, Paley's type of design argument ceased to be plausible. The verdict is still out on design arguments in their metaphysical and cosmological forms. In our day, those who defend theistic arguments do so in a spirit of epistemic humility: in philosophy, contrary positions can be equally rational.64 The lack of a decisive case for or against God's existence is surely a con tributing factor in the lack of a consensus among those who think deeply and knowledgably about the theistic question. Jefferson seemed to have believed 63. Paine, Age of Reason, 150. 64. Eric Reitan exemplifies this contemporary approach in his enlightened engagement with the new atheists. See Eric Reitan, Is God a Delusion? A Reply to Religions Cultured Despis ers (Maiden, Massachusetts: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009), chaps. 5 and 6.1 believe that Charles Hartshorne's arguments for God's existence should also be framed in this way.

In a letter of February 27,1821, to Timothy Pickering, he expressed confidence that "the whole of our country will soon be rallied to the unity of the Creator, and I hope, to the pure doctrine of Jesus also."65 Following the same line of think ing, he wrote to Benjamin Waterhouse on June 28, 1822, "I rejoice that in this blessed country of free enquiry and belief, which has surrendered its creed and conscience to neither king nor priest, the genuine doctrine of one only God is reviving, and I trust that there is not a young man now living in the United States who will not die an Unitarian."66 Finally, on January 18,1824, he wrote to John Davis of his hopes for a return to "primitive Christianity, in all the simplicity in which it came from the lips of Jesus." He continued, "I trust... that the same free exercise of private judgment which gave us our political reformation will extend it's [sic] effects to that of religion .. ,"67 Contrary to Jefferson's expectations, freedom of religion was followed by religious pluralism. Worse still, from a Jeffersonian perspective, the influence of Unitarianism diminished while the Trinitarians and the Calvinists, for whom he had such scorn, are as vigorous now as they were in his day. One might even go further and speculate on the extent to which the new atheists are the true inheritors of Jefferson's, also Paine's, religious ideas. The low opinion of the Bible shared by Paine and Jefferson is also evident in the new atheist literature.68 Following Franklin, Paine, and Jefferson, the new atheists regard Jesus with deference and even admiration?Richard Dawkins calls himself an "atheist for Jesus."69 Finally, the design argument defended by the founders is no longer defensible. Subtracting this argument from the deist arsenal, one is left with something that looks a lot like the new atheism. The one caveat?and it is an all important caveat?is that the new atheists are not always as enthusiastic about the freedom of religion as were the founders. Sam Harris, for example, maintains that "Some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them."70 This is a startling claim, and it is a very 65.

Harris's claim is disturbingly reminiscent of Aquinas's argument</page><page sequence="18">100 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy long way from the Jeffersonian idea, expressed in the Virginia statute, that "our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions, any more than our opinions in physics or geometry."71 The deists are often criticized for making God remote and religiously un available. There is truth in this charge. They never questioned the assumption of the science of their day that God created a universe of strict mechanical necessity. A favorite metaphor of the time was that the cosmos is an enormous machine, like a clock, the laws of operation of which science could discover. As Paine says, "The Almighty is the great mechanic of the creation."72 Following Spinoza, they argued that it would be contrary to God's nature to intervene miraculously; a being powerful and intelligent enough to make a universe would not need periodically to tinker with it, after the manner of a human mechanic, to insure that his or her goals were accomplished. An auxiliary consideration, for the deists, was that the divine is so far beyond human affairs that it would not concern itself with performing acts of magic on our account. The American deists did not struggle with the troubling implications of the mechanical metaphor of God and the universe, although they could not have been unaware of the problem. If the universe is a machine, and God is the mechanic, then human free will is jeopardized and God may be responsible for the evil that the creatures do to each other.73 This is not to say that the American deists were without resources for addressing at least one aspect of the problem. In his letter of August 15, 1820, to John Adams, which we quoted above, Jefferson argues that God endowed matter with thinking. It is for killing heretics.

Paine, Age of Reason, 189. 73. Voltaire saw the problem but could find no satisfactory answer for it. He toys with the idea that God permits, rather than directly wills, the variety of religious belief systems. On the other hand, if an omnipotent God presides over a universe every movement of which results from mechanical necessity, then, in the divine case, permitting and willing come to the same thing (Voltaire, Dictionnaire, 302). God "has foreseen everything, arranged everything... all obey irrevocably the power he has impressed for ever on nature" (Ibid., 290). It follows not only that the various religions are necessary but that God must also will the suffering of the creatures! The problem is aggravated by the metaphor of the machine-universe. Voltaire can only respond, "I see clearly what is false, and I know very little what is true" (Ibid., 303).</page><page sequence="19">Volume 31, No. 2, May 2010 101 no more mysterious, he insists, that God can endow matter with thinking than it is that God can endow it with gravitational attraction. To further bolster his materialism, Jefferson implies that it is less mysterious that matter can have the power of thought than that "an absence of matter can have a will, and by that will put matter into motion . . ,"74 Thus, Jefferson believed that his materialistic form of deism left room for human thinking, and by implica tion, for the freedom required by thought. For Jefferson, however, as for other American deists, the conundrums of theodicy gave way to the problems of formulating laws for a just society and how best to use the conscience with which they believed God left us. The vastness of the heavens, and the idea that there are countless worlds like our own scattered throughout its emptiness, became, for the deists, a measure of the distance of God from us. Pascal was frightened by "the eternal silence of these infinite spaces."75 Paine feels no existential dread in contemplating the immensity of things. "The solitary idea of a solitary world, rolling or at rest in the immense ocean of space, gives place to the cheerful idea of a society of worlds, so happily contrived as to administer, even by their motion, instruction to man."76 The expression "society of worlds" suggests that Paine believed in life, and perhaps intelligent life, elsewhere in the cosmos. We might not be solitary denizens in an "ocean of space" but one among many intelligent spe cies in "a society of worlds." It is very easy to imagine Paine, transported into the twenty-first century, being an enthusiast of science fiction in the tradition of Star Trek. The deists had little patience with religious ecstasy or mysticism. The only religious experience they seemed to acknowledge was meditating on the dictates of conscience. They were concerned with human welfare but they did not dwell on human sin. The fiery intensity of Pascal's Memorial or even the glowing embers of John Wesley's heart "strangely warmed" are foreign to deistic religion.77 A more antideistical statement could not be found than Pascal's, "The heart has its reasons that reason knows not."78 Nor were the deists sensitive to Pascal's 74.

Nor, it seems, are there feelings in God. Franklin and Jefferson speak of God's indifference to human beings. Franklin's local deity has passions; but all emotions are absent from the Infinite God, as Franklin conceives it. Jef ferson's metaphysics is not so baroque, but he agrees that "in the perfection of [God's] state, he can feel [no] pain or pleasure from any thing we may do; he is far above our power."81 True, God is said to be benevolent in setting up a world for us; but it is like the benevolence of a man who, before leaving on a trip from which he will never return, provides for his children. It is a doctrine that I label theological behaviorism?God behaving in benevolent ways but having no feelings of compassion?and it is not different in its essentials from the Thomistic God that acts but is never acted upon.82 The relations between the creatures and God are asymmetrical. God is the cause of the universe, and the deist can thank God for going to the trouble of creating; but nothing that the creatures do has any effect on God, so prayers of thanksgiving would never get a divine hearing and, in any event, would be beneath God's desiring. There are curious inconsistencies and a lack of imagination in the American deist's vision of God. They emphasize the epistemic abyss between God and the creatures. Our intellects, they say, cannot penetrate the infinity of God; God is beyond human understanding. For example, Paine says that the power and wisdom of God are "incomprehensible."83 For Jefferson, questions about the meaning of divine perfection are "insoluble" and "unimportant" where they do not touch questions of morality.84 If this is true, then how did the deists know that God is available only to the reasoning mind? Or from whence came the conclusion that God is impervious to creaturely influence? The God of deism seems too much like a king that is too busy with the affairs of state to take notice of his subjects. He is powerful enough to manage his vast territory, but he is incapable of walking among his people. His decrees are obeyed, but 79. Ibid., 253. 80. Paine, Age of Reason, 33. 81.

It is a human image writ large which retains the human defects. In my view, the balancing act of responsible theology is to be anthropomor phic without attributing creaturely limitations to God. In this task, the deists made only halting progress. Consider Franklin's early theology. The deity that presides over our little corner of the universe is a lesser god compared to the Infinite Creator of all. In one respect, however, the lesser god is greater than the Creator, for he is capable of caring for the creatures under his charge. The Creator can be congratulated on the fine work of creation, but there is no sense in trying to serve a being that can gain nothing from our service. Thus, it is the lesser deity that Franklin worships. A more robust, not to say simpler, theology would combine the exemplary characteristics of both the Creator and the local deity into a single unsurpassable being. Arguably, something like this synthesis is accomplished in process theology. Hartshorne, for example, replaces the idea of God as the unmoved mover with God as "the most and best moved mover."85 God feels all and is felt by all. The mention of feelings in God calls to mind Jefferson's expression, "I feel, therefore I exist."86 Jefferson wrote this in response to "a crowd of skepticisms" raised by John Adams. It could have been used, however, as an analogical key for theology. Why could God not feel, but in eminent fashion? Like other de ists, Jefferson was willing to attribute to God intelligence sufficient to design the universe. In this way, the activity of God was emphasized. Had Jefferson attributed feelings to God, he might have emphasized the passivity of God. Again, this would have brought deism closer to process theology, and perhaps even to Whitehead's notion of God as "the great companion?the fellow-suf ferer who understands."87 The distance between Jefferson and process theology grows less when one recalls that he was a materialist and that he allowed for the possibility of an everlasting universe, coexistent with God. A familiar theme of process theism is that God has a physical pole, which Hartshorne identi fies with the universe itself.88 Jefferson does not dwell on whether God can be located in space. Had he denied this, his distance from process theism would 85. Charles Hartshorne, The Zero Fallacy and Other Essays in Neoclassical Philosophy, ed.

If deistic theology is in some ways crudely anthropomorphic, deistic Chris tology is in some ways crudely ethnocentric. It is especially clear in the cases of Paine and Jefferson that Jesus remains a deistic moral philosopher. One can almost imagine the man from Nazareth?Paine's "virtuous and amiable man"?wearing a peruke, a silk cravat, and breeches, speaking French in the National Assembly. It is more difficult to imagine him driving the money chang ers from the temple, associating with prostitutes and tax collectors, openly cursing the Pharisees, uttering prophecies, and orchestrating his entry into Jerusalem on the back of a donkey. Likewise for Jefferson: It was not histori cal research that informed him what does and does not have "the stamp of the eloquence and fine imagination of Jesus." Jefferson's Jesus does not heal the sick, perform wondrous acts, or blur the distinction between himself and God. For example, Luke tells the story of the young Jesus getting lost from his parents in Jerusalem. After three days, Mary and Joseph find him in the temple questioning the teachers. Mary scolds him for wandering away and causing his family grief. Jesus says, "Did you not know that I must be in my father's house?" (Lk 2:49). The Jefferson Bible omits Jesus's response.89 What Paine and Jefferson resist is the scandal of looking at Jesus through first century eyes, for fear that something of the first century may actually have been true of him. The one concession that Jefferson makes is that Jesus might have viewed himself as divinely inspired. Coming from a Jewish culture that regularly attributed inspiration to its prophets, Jesus could easily have viewed his own reform efforts as divinely guided. As Jefferson explained to William Short in the letter of August 4, 1820, "Elevated by the enthusiasm of a warm and pure heart, conscious of the high strains of an eloquence which had not been taught him, he might readily mistake the coruscations of his own fine genius for inspirations of an higher order."90 It would be consistent with these principles for Jefferson to attribute to Jesus a belief in the devil, in demon possession, and his ability to exorcise demons, even though Jefferson did not accept these ideas. However, even here, Jefferson evinces skepticism that many of the early Christian writers themselves believed these things, so perhaps he would not attribute them to Jesus either.91 The deists believed that they knew God by reason alone and they supposed 89.

Ibid., 235, from a letter to John Adams, February 14, 1814.</page><page sequence="23">Volume 31, No. 2, May 2010 105 that God, by reason alone, spoke to human beings. Paine can make the witty remark that Eve was not surprised to hear a serpent speak.92 He seems unable to read the story of Eden as a parable of the drama of human disobedience to God. He can ask pejoratively why Jesus did not discover America when Satan took him to the mountain to survey all the kingdoms of the world.93 Apparently, he cannot read the account of the temptations as an allegory of the inner struggles of a man who is asking what kind of person he shall become, whether he will choose to be obedient to God. In short, where it is not a question of moral precepts, Paine and Jefferson are biblical literalists. The literal meaning?that is to say, the nonmetaphorical, nonallegorical, nonparabolic meaning?of the Bible is measured against the world as revealed by eighteenth century science and is found, not surprisingly, to be full of falsehoods. Jefferson finds in Scripture moral inspiration; Paine is less sanguine on this topic, preferring instead to spotlight the X-rated aspects of the Bible stories, especially in the Hebrew Scriptures. Jefferson, too, it should be noted, was much less patient with the Old Testament than with the New Testament. Both men, however, turn a blind eye to narratives and their importance to moral reasoning. Moral truths are best taught by example, and examples are best remembered as part of a story. For instance, it is a fine thing to say "love your neighbor as yourself," but it is more memorable to learn the parable of the good Samaritan (Lk 10:25-37). Because this parable involves no violation of nature's laws, Jef ferson included it in his redaction of the Gospels. If Jesus performs a miracle, Jefferson retains the moral principle but edits the pericope. The Sabbath is made for man, not man for the Sabbath, says Jesus. As illustration, Jesus heals a man's withered hand on the Sabbath (Matt. 12:9-41). Jefferson allows the man with the crippled hand to be in the synagogue when Jesus provides his moral lesson, but he interrupts the narrative just short of the healing. Jefferson may be correct to suppose that a miracle never occurred. However, this is beside the point, for without the healing, the moral principle hangs in abstraction, unanchored to the imagination. Paine seems equally oblivious to the importance of narrative for moral rea soning. Worse still, his treatment of Hebrew Scripture is an exercise in the fallacy of suppressed evidence. It is true that the Bible contains stories of rape, incest, murder, betrayal, skullduggery, and plain stupidity. Paine does not often notice the stories of loyalty, heroism, honesty, integrity, forgiveness, and shrewd reasoning. For example, Paine calls the book of Ruth "an idle, bungling story, foolishly told," although he concedes that it is "one of the best books in the Bible, 92. Paine, Age of Reason, 15. 93. Ibid., 66.</page><page sequence="24">106 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy for it is free from murder and rapine."94 Another example is the tale of Joseph at the end of the book of Genesis, which Paine ignores. The Bible's figures are less often models of morality than mirrors of identity?although Joseph can surely be put in the former category. In general, the Bible's stories lay bare the very worst and the very best in human beings, including human conceptions of God. For example, the divine can be portrayed as a murderous brigand (as in Ex. 4:24-26) and as a longsuffering spouse (as in the book of Hosea). C. S. Lewis summarizes a nonliteralist understanding of Scripture in his book Reflections on the Psalms: "The human qualities of the raw materials show through. Na?vet?, error, contradiction, even (as in the cursing Psalms) wickedness are not removed. The total result is not 'the word of God' in the sense that every passage, in itself, gives impeccable science or history. It carries the Word of God; and we (under grace, with attention to tradition and to interpreters wiser than ourselves, and with the use of such intelligence and learning as we may have) receive that word from it not by using it as an encyclopedia or an encyclical but by steeping ourselves in its tone or temper and so learning its overall message."95 Using Lewis's ideas, a coherent picture may emerge if the Bible's stories, includ ing its statements about the character of God, are read in light of the Decalogue (Ex. 20:1-17; Deut. 5. 5:8-21) and the commandment to love others as yourself (Lev. 19:18, 34). The hermeneutical key is to approach the Bible from its moral summits rather than from the moral pits that Paine liked to emphasize. The Bible may then be understood as the story of people groping towards the conception of a just and compassionate Creator, and what it means for imperfect and sinful creatures to live lives faithful to the personality of such a being. In order to read the Bible in this way it is necessary to abandon the one-sided literalism and the anachronistic views of Jesus of both Paine and Jefferson. VI. Conclusion One cannot help admiring the audacity and genius of the American deists. They boldly challenged over a thousand years of religious tradition and set into motion an experiment in religious liberty that was quite unimaginable to most of those who had come before them. I have argued, however, that their deism was flawed in ways that they could not quite imagine. Their view of God was in some ways crudely anthropomorphic; their interpretation of Jesus was in some ways crudely ethnocentric; their approach to the Bible was crudely literalistic. I have made tentative suggestions about who bears the deist legacy. The 94. Ibid., 100. 95. C. S.

I do not know whether they could have exorcised their literalism and acknowledged that Christians could conscientiously embrace modern "higher criticism" of the Bible. Perhaps Jefferson, with his redaction of the Gospels, was distantly approaching this view. I have no doubt, however, that Franklin, Paine, and Jefferson would have accepted Darwinian evolution. They were too committed to reason not to be swayed by the preponderance of evidence that favors it?Jefferson took the first step by recognizing the extinction of species.96 Of course, accepting evolution doesn't make one an atheist any more than being a theist leads one to reject evolution. I have indicated ways in which deist ideas?especially those of Jefferson?can be extended in the direction of process theology, and process thinkers are thoroughly committed to evolution. The deists seem to have avoided the new atheist's mistake?also the mistake of some intelligent design theorists?of viewing God as a hypothesis in sci ence. To be sure, the design they attributed to nature was, for them, evidence of God, but they did not suppose that God's activity involves an intervention into natural processes. Arguably, then, they understood the difference between metaphysics and science in a way that the new atheists do not. Perhaps the best conclusion is that in terms of philosophical theology the deists existed in the twilight of the Enlightenment, with only intimations of what was ahead. Political philosophy is another matter. The Americans, aided doubtless by their relative geographical isolation, created a society in which religious bigotry could be criticized and even laughed at, without fear of reprisal. Thus, if I criticize these giants it is not without a profound gratefulness to the fact that I can do so under the umbrella of religious freedom that they helped to create. I submit that the moral stature of a Jefferson, willing to agree to disagree with his theological adversaries, is worth more than the doctrinal correctness of a cathedral full of cardinals or a mosque full of mullahs. Perhaps a different comparison, and a slight pun, is in order. Jesus praised the poor widow for putting her last mites into the temple treasury (Mk 12:42-44). Her copper coins would not purchase much, but she gave all that she had. The American deists can be admired for using reason's mite. It could not purchase everything they believed, but we are the beneficiaries of their generous spirit. 96. Jefferson's views changed. In his "Notes on the State of Virginia," published in 1789, he denied that the Mammoth is extinct on the grounds that "Such is the conomy of nature, that no instance can be produced of her having permitted any one race of her animals to become extinct; of her having formed any link in her great work so weak as to be broken" (Peterson, Portable Thomas Jefferson, 86). Thirty-four years later, in a letter to Adams, he invokes the activity of God to explain the maintenance of a universe where stars die and "certain races of animals go extinct" (Adams, Jefferson's Extracts, 411).</page></plain_text>
