<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Rauschen of the Waves: On the Margins of Literature Rildiger Campe A TRIP AT SEA IN THE YEAR 1769 that goes from Riga to Paimboeuf at the mouth of the Loire and lasts almost a month. The sight of the ocean, the play of the waves in the ear: that means by improvisation or as in a chance laboratory-situation "to philosophize from nature without books and in- struments."' I return to the ocean and into its ground[....]the fish, what does it do? What sort of new water-senses does it have, that we air and earth creatures do not feel? Can they not be analogically discovered? If a human being is ever to become aware of magnetic force then it would be a blind man who can only hear and feel, or more a man bereft of sight, hearing, smell and taste, who could only feel. What sort of senses does a fish have? In the twilight of the water it sees, in the heavy air it hears; in its thick shell the oyster feels[. .. . ]As wave breaks into wave, so the air undulations and sounds flow into each other. The sensuousness of the water-world is as water is to air in hearing and seeing!2 Herder passes through the Huygenian analog-metaphorics of wave interference twice in his Journal meiner Reise: man as fish or oyster reduces the three senses of sight, hearing, and touch to feeling; the fish as man, by contrast, posits the one sense of feeling for all three senses. One can read this as an allegory of reading, more precisely, as an allegory of the Her- derian conversion of learned reading to the reading of literature. And it is, with Herder's visible and audible will, somewhat bold and somewhat simplified. But such a reading is the matrix of that reading to which the Rauschen of the ocean in the Neuere deutsche Literatur, at first, refers. As far as it concerns the voice of one who speaks and the voice which one hears, Rauschen* is first of all a matter of ordering, that means here, a matter of the limit; secondly, it is a matter of the medium, that means of the transmission within one medium and the transposition from one medium into another. * The German word Rauschen can mean, among other things, "roar," "noise," "static;" it is used here, in addition, to refer to the Latin strepitus and the French bruit. SubStance No 61, 1990 21</page><page sequence="2">22 Rfidiger Campe The Latin grammarians (quotations here are from Priscian), when describing the sounds represented by the letters of the alphabet, worked with a system that combined two parameters: articulated vs. unarticulated (i.e., with or without the participation of the mind) and literate vs. illiterate (i.e., writable or not writable). Thus the voces were called articulate and literate-the sounds of the syllables and words of a given language. Articu- lated, but illiterate were sounds of pain, for example, for which a given alphabet had no transcription; unarticulated, but literate would be the croak of frogs, a sound whose production is unaccompanied by thought on the part of the subjects making it, but which nonetheless can be written by other subjects (in Latin: coax). Unarticulated and illiterate was the strepitus, the Geriiusch, a word that can designate every sort of noise and Rauschen, also the tones of the zither and the flute. When in the tradition of physiognomy there is talk of the "rauschende voice" and the fear it arouses, this goes back to an acoustics of the holy, and especially to a media transposition which, in Christian contexts, leads to the holy scriptures: the mighty voice that St. John heard on Patmos "was like the enormous sound of rushing water" (Revelation 1:15). That is con- nected with the Old Testament Geri'uschhaftigkeit ("noisiness") of divine utterances (the voice of the Lord "resounds over the waters," Psalm 29:3). In Daniel, the speech of the epiphany is called a great roar (Daniel 10:6); the voice, moreover, tells St. John precisely this: "Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches."'4 What in the Old Testament is involved with the Lord's tendency to express himself in natural catastrophes like storm, fire, and flood, or personally to convey messages to prophets like Daniel, belongs here with the St. John of the Revelation to a media transposition and a transmission by media: from the zero degree rauschende voice (which is technically the signal for the opening of a channel) to seeing, to writing, to the sending of letters. (Indeed, the rauschende voice will, before it actually switches the optical channel into operation, dictate to St. John salutary addresses to the seven churches.) Grammar and the science of holy media: two uncircumventible sys- tem-references of "Rauschen" whose respective coordinates cannot be mapped onto each other. Literature in the sense of the Herderian water- world as reading-world, however, is the mediality of writing/reading. And if in grammar it concerns the strepitus as a limit of the litterae, and in the media-world of the Testaments it concerns signals and transposition-ef- fects-then one can assume that in literature it concerns a metaphor of the limit, the system-analysis of a translated Rauischen. The following deals with three passages which are involved with the limit and the transmis-</page><page sequence="3">The Rauschen of the Waves 23 sion/transposition resulting in various configurations: (1) the discursive example of Rauschen as a limit of perception, which is necessarily followed by literary discourse (with special consideration given to psychology); (2) representation of Rauschen's limit for perception, in the discursive ordering of the text or the reproduction of the disturbance and initial starting phenomena Rauschen within the organization of the text; (3) the narrative representation of the disturbance and ignition phenomena which is Raus- chen in the technical medium, a transition of the narrative. These three configurations of limit and transmission/ transposition give the first indica- tions for a (historically usable) topology of literature. Determinations First: the discursive example of the perception of Rauschen as limit, terminus, term(s). In 1704 Leibniz developed his notes on Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding (which was first published in 1690) into a dialogue between a certain Philalethes (alias Locke) and a certain Theophilus (alias Leibniz) after Locke had insistently refused to respond to Leibniz's shorter notes that he had received by letter.5 Before Leibniz was able to complete the manuscript, Locke died. The published dialogue would have represented the answer of a Plato to an Aristotle-but once again Plato, for reasons of historical contingency, was too late. Under these cir- cumstances, Leibniz refrained from publication.6 While in the main text Leibniz responds move for move to Locke's Essay, a non-dialogic introduction was needed first in order to establish his own role, the role of Plato. In an important section of this introduction one finds Leibniz's example of the "roar [Geritusch] of the ocean." It is the point of intersection between the two lines of argument with which he counters Locke's critique of "innate ideas." While Locke binds perception and con- sciousness strictly to one another, Leibniz responds in the introduction with a model in which unity and division of perception and consciousness are combined: consciousness is the limit value of perception. This is at the same time a status debate: the strict unity of perception and consciousness argues as the unity of a psychological theory of perception, while unity- and-division argues as the separation-and-parallelism of metaphysics and psychology. The answer thus returns again to something that the simul- taneously later and earlier, as Husserl will have it, "psychologistic" dis- course of Locke had neglected to consider.</page><page sequence="4">24 Riudiger Campe Two Gera'usch-stories enframe the Rauschen of the ocean. First it con- cerns a mill and a waterfall. "[...] we become so accustomed to the motion of a mill or waterfall, after living beside it for a while, that we pay no heed to it." 7 Heed and with it determinate ideas (according to Locke's terminol- ogy)8 are withdrawn by custom. The example itself is admittedly lacking in heed and determinacy; one knows neither whether the perception- without-consciousness is a seeing or a hearing, nor whether the mill and waterfall with their metonymic relation are simply neighboring examples or form the ensemble of a watermill. There may be a non-determined, non-conscious connection to a passage in Locke's text, to which the response is announced here-keeping in mind that the introduction, in contrast to the dialogue, has no counterpart in Locke. Leibniz's three ex- amples of non-conscious partial perceptions are particularly directed against Locke's remarks on memory at the end of the first book of the Essay. There one reads: Suppose a Child had the use of his Eyes till he knows and distinguishes Colours; but then Cataracts shut the Windows, and he is forty or fifty years in the dark; and in that time perfectly loses all memory of the Idea of colours, he once had.9 Cataract is in English (after the French)"l the disease of the clouding of the eye's lenses-and it is a waterfall, a "chute d'eau." Leibniz next addresses his first example by means of a new example (which is perhaps merely the first in a more general form), a determining word, a metaphorical operation: one must "admonish" and "alert" us "to pay heed to certain of our present perceptions" so that we do not allow them-like cataracts-"to slip unconsidered, and even unnoticed." "If someone however alerts us to them straight away, and makes us take note, for instance, of some noise which we have just heard, then we remember it and become aware of just having had some sense of it.""11 The alerting sign, the constative utterance as command directed to memory: in this way the discourse of determinations, the terminology steps onto the metonymically open field of 'perception.' After the example of the "roaring or Rauschen of the ocean" comes the third example, namely that of the Gerailsch that wakes us from sleep-al- though we at first have no apperception of the motions of our senses. The Geriiusch is signal, the command that simply switches on consciousness itself, the zero element of discourse. It is also clear and distinct how Leibniz connects with Locke's text as he readies himself to respond to it: at the beginning of the second book Locke discussed the possibility of percep-</page><page sequence="5">The Rauschen of the Waves 25 tions in sleep and at the same time (and in particular) the problem of waking up.12 Leibniz provides, in earlier comments on Locke's Essay with regard to these paragraphs, the story of a man who always woke up at night because the lamp which he constantly kept lit went out-a negative optical example-then also the story of someone who was awakened by several voices calling him simultaneously (a single voice could not have penetrated his sleep). This acoustic example is, in transformed shape, the example of the Rauschen of the ocean.13 Between mill and waterfall on the one side, and awakening Gerdusch on the other, Leibniz gives the example which, as he affirms, he "cus- tomarily" uses-the exemplary example. He already has given it in the notes which he indirectly sent to Locke-there where he has also posi- tioned himself as Plato in opposition to Aristotle.14 Of course, the reader already knows from the preceding example in the introduction-which first had to be awakened from indeterminacy by a general formulation- that doing things "customarily" is precisely what destroys heed and deter- minacy. The exemplary example is for that reason also the example that threatens its own-rhetorical-power to draw the reader's attention. At the same time all content depends on the outcome of the performative game. Rhetorically stated: the auctoritas of the exemplum threatens itself in that it gives an exemplary demonstration of the habitual character of rhetoric itself, a rhetoric that is premised on repeated usage. It is the ex- ample where theories of perception and certain uses of discourse are deli- cately interwoven. To hear this noise [ce bruit] as we do, one must certainly hear the parts which make up this whole, that is the noise [les bruits de chaque vague] of each wave, although each of these noises [chacun de ces petits bruits] makes itself known only when combined confusedly with all the others, that is in the roaring, and would not be noticed if the wave which made it were by itself.15 In the first example (mill or waterfall), word or term is added "after a little while," pointing and alerting; in the third example (the awakening Geriusch), the Gerdusch acts as terminus in that it switches on consciousness itself, which will have apperceived it. The exemplary and habitual example of the Rauschen of the ocean demonstrates how the Geriusche and the corresponding perceptions-without-consciousness achieve the appercep- tion as Rauschen and the status of the term "Rauschen." But here the limit between the motion of the senses and consciousness is being drawn at the same time and has also already been reached. There is on the one hand the metonymic relation of a limit-the limit of perceptibility-and at the same</page><page sequence="6">26 Riidiger Campe time, the metaphorical relation between the many small Gerausche and the "entirety" of the Rauschen that one can call the "roaring of the ocean." In the interweaving of the metonymic with the metaphoric relations occurs the addition of the name or term; the waking signal sounds in the ex- emplary text itself. The exemplary text attains a determinate "Rauschen," the term that calls confused perception by name. That is why it is impor- tant that one can add the maternal genitive: "mugissement ou bruit de la mer / mbre." But it would be just as much a trap to explain psychoanalyti- cally the delicate balance of the example between self-destruction (of rhetoric) and self-exemplification (of the exemplary), as it would be to see in it the illustration of an infinitesimal determination of limit. The mother's voice speaks,6 the calculus calculates only through a rhetorico-semiotic operation, the rhetorization of semiotics and the semiotization of rhetoric. It is this bruit that is at play in the example (Leibniz gave his "platonic" answer in French, responding to the French translation of the Essay of 1700). For one thing, "ce bruit" in the quoted passage takes up an earlier "bruit et mugissement de la mer," "roaring and Rauschen of the ocean": that is the apperception as Rauschein. "Ce bruit," however, also anticipates the Geriiuschi of the particular wave, the Gerdiusch that does not become conscious, and in this sense it is also used in the plural: "les bruits de chaque vague." The name for the singular that can be pluralized, and the collective name for the multiplicity are in French the same: "le bruit et mugissement de la mer"-'"ce bruit;' "ce bruit-les bruits de chaque vague.""17 In this way the exemplary-habitual example, the example of the theory of perception engendered by the discourse of terminology, de-com- poses itself. It is an example of the confusion of perception theory and a certain use of discourse. What that does to the relation between rhetoric and semiotics can be supplied with data from the history of rhetoric. Leibniz had studied precisely the "ce bruit" game as the argumentation of "humanistic nominalism" in the "True principles" of Mario Nizolio (1533). Unlike medieval nominalists, Nizolio appealed to rhetoric for proof that the for- mation of general concepts is exclusively an operation with signs and names. According to Nizolio there are, first of all, proper names that can only be used singly and only for single things. Then, likewise, there are singly used collective names (the people, the army), which always desig- nate a multiplicity "taken together" in one. In the third place there is an intermediate genre-Nizolio calls it "simple appellatives"-which, accord- ing to their use as singular or plural, designate a single thing or a multi- plicity: man, men. The philosophers' error with regard to substances,</page><page sequence="7">The Rauschen of the Waves 27 according to Nizolio, rests on the possibility of using simple appellatives in the synecdoche (the figure: singular for plural, plural for singular): "man" for the multiplicity of men; "the Romans" for any single Roman.'8 In the exemplary text, Leibniz plays a synecdochal game with the name "bruit." That, however, does not mean from a historical perspective that the de- composition of the example is illegitimate because it is merely rhetorical. Nizolio wanted to show how rhetorical figuration interferes with logical problems-thus, the exact opposite of a denunciation of mere disturbance of semiotics and grammar by rhetoric. That is why Leibniz's example is all the more a delicate game of rhetoric with the ordering of discourse: in the name of the Rauschecn it demonstrates the rhetoricity of semiotic ordering itself and semiotizes rhetoric; with this Leibniz responds to Locke, for whom rhetoric was just the Rauschen, i.e., the disturbance factor, of the grammatico-logical ordering. Thus, the acoustic example of the Ranzlschen that comes to the ear as the Rauschen of the ocean is a motif (and movens) of the discourse that integrates rhetorical deviation, which around 1700 one began to call literature. And it is, moreover, even beyond this bond, also the psychology of Rauschen. At the end of the nineteenth century, in the "physiological psychology" of Wilhelm Wundt, Geriiusche are either only "accompanying" sensations or sensations of Geriusche as nameable Geri'usche ("the thunder of a storm, the Rauschen of the wind, the crackling of a fire"). Wundt admittedly gives up the bond to discourse. Working through the functions experimentally, ac- cording to the stipulations of the theory of stimulus thresholds, he affirms that a syntagmatic Geriusclhe name as, for example, "the thunder of a storm" is due to associations with visual perceptions. Insofar as he clings to the "idea" (Vorstellung) as an initial concept, it is also with him a matter of Geriiusche that are essentially linked to their specific names, as, for example the Rauschen of the ocean. Insofar as he experimentally analyzes the Vorstel- lung into the smallest measurable differences of sensation, he unlinks psychology and literary example.'" But at this time, literature is also al- ready hearing a different Ralschlen at its margin. Flux et riflux Second: another reader of Locke, some seventy years after Leibniz. Rousseau writes in the R3vcries dui promenezur solitaire, on which he worked from 1776 until his death in 1778, about what he calls the asylum of Ile St. Pierre in Lake Bienne. At the center is the memory of the monotonous</page><page sequence="8">28 Riidiger Campe Rauschen of the waves in the fifth of the ten promenades. At the beginning of the Rtveries Rousseau sets up the triptych that interpreters up to this day have before them: the Confessions-the Dialogues-the Reveries. As in the Dialogues, it concerns his persecutors-and yet, there is no longer any hope, as there was in the Dialogues, of convincing a future generation of his innocence. The Reveries are introduced as a sort of continuation of the Confessions (indeed the Confessions end with the episode of St. Pierre)-yet there is nothing left to confess.20 To the extent that the R&amp;veries engage in argumentation, they no longer want to persuade; insofar as they narrate further, they no longer want to confess. If they are able to argue and narrate, then it is perhaps because the argument does not refer to the future of the persuading, and the past of the narrative is not bound to a confes- sion. In Rousseau's remembered perception of the Rauschen of the waves it is a matter of the differentiation that he had already used in the Discours sur l'inigalitd, and which he works out later with the help of that critical rela- tion, formulated around 1700, between perception and consciousness. Rousseau speaks of "pure sensation" without consciousness, memory, communication; and, on the other hand, of "sentiment" which supplies the beginnings of consciousness, memory, communication. When evening approached, I would come down from the heights of the island and willingly [volontiers] go sit in some hidden nook along the beach at the edge of the lake. There, the noise [bruit] of the waves and the distur- bance [agitation] of the water, captivating my senses and chasing all other disturbance [agitation] from my soul, plunged it into a delightful reverie in which night would often surprise me without having noticed it. The ebb and flow of this water and its noise [bruitl, continual but magnified at intervals, striking my ear and eyes without respite, took the place of the internal movements which reverie extinguished within me and was enough to make me feel my existence with pleasure and without taking the trouble to think.21 It begins like the text of those movements of which Leibniz's first example has spoken. Here, too, are adjacent acoustic and optical move- ments: "the bruit of the waves and the disturbance of the water"-"struck my ear and my eyes." Then, as in the continuation of Leibniz's first ex- ample, the adjacency is asymmetrically altered in favor of hearing: because it often does become night "without [my] having noticed it," and because it is the singular "my ear" as opposed to the plural "my eyes." That is representation in motion, putting-itself-in-the-place, what is called "supplier," to use Rousseau's word: first hearing for hearing-or-seeing, then physiological instead of psychological "movement." Inversion of the</page><page sequence="9">The Rauschen of the Waves 29 movement demonstrated by Derrida of the added supplement of writing is here a sign-erasing supplement of physiological movement. The sensation of Rauschen stands in Rousseau where Leibniz hears precisely nothing. The supplemented sensation of Geriusch expells Rauschen from optical-acoustic synchronization and from every interiority of perception. The fact that something is no longer perceived does not mean that nothing is perceived. Below the semiotic-discursive ordering there is a pleasure that corresponds to a sort of static disturbance. Perhaps receivers and other gadgets take pleasure in receiving, that is to say, functioning. So far it is the idyllic topos of the bruit des vagues. "From time to time," Rousseau continues, "some weak and short reflection about the instability of things in this world arose, an image offered me by the surface of the water. But soon these weak impressions were erased by the uniformity of the continual movement which rocked me [bercer] ...." 22 This is the text of the representation of movement. The reflection produces the image of the ocean, a visuality, that awakens meanings-first of the instability of the world, later of passion23 (as it corresponds to old emblematics). Reflection, image, meaning, emblematics are themselves pathetic (and from passion arises, according to Rousseau, music and language). There is in the visual--even if only "temporarily," just as all information in the Rauschen of technical systems is temporary-sign and meaning, meaning and reflec- tion, pathos and representation. In Leibniz the bruit is decomposed by a textual game with the name, then in Rousseau the text decomposes itself through a game, with the text itself maintaining bruit in its center. The construction of the two parts as text: the text-part of movements and the text-part of the representation of movement, refer to each other in the figure of the chiasmus. In the "idyllic" text-part that drifts towards acoustic: movement for movement; place- holding as erasure; in the pathetic-reflective text-part with its temporary visuality: the image of the surface. The Rauschen functions in the middle between the two text-parts like a mirror (seen from the visual second part) and like the static Raulschen (heard from the acoustic first part). Given the relation between the two parts there can and must be inter- pretation: one must say that with the word "to rock" (bercer) in the closing, a return from the pathos-text to the movement-text the psychoanalysis of so-called regression is opened-to close the text. Of greater weight, how- ever, is this: the first text-part proceeds precisely through Rousseau's analysis of memory which leads the remembering one back into the remembered condition (derepresentation); the second text-part follows Rousseau's theorem that only what is pathetically experienced is remem-</page><page sequence="10">30 Rildiger Campe bered again (pathos of representation). But exactly for that reason the second part is narrative, and only this part is reported by Rousseau at the end of the Confessions. The first part proceeds analytically: it is added in the Reveries. That is what it means to take up the severe and upright examina- tion of the Confessions again without laying claim to the title of confession once more. Finally, the first text-part transplants the one who hears into the medium of the waves, it has him "plunge" into revery; the second res- titutes, temporarily, the place of the observer on the bank. But we will have to recall the comment near the beginning of the "fifth promenade" where it says that storm and waves erode the bank of the Ile St. Pierre piece by piece. The chiasmus of the two parts composes and decomposes the entire text in such a way that it preserves the Rauschen as the limit of its discur- sivity in the middle of its technical functioning. Such a text-rhetoric be- comes systematically thinkable only after the end of the inherited rhetoric which Leibniz uses in the example of bruit. A rhetoric such as that of the Rousseau passage does not prescribe strategic goals for texts (and even should it be the goal of the transgression of rhetoric in the direction of the grammaticity of discourse); rather it presents an analysis of the repre- sentation of texts. Rauschenc is not only the limit of discursivity that can "even still" figuratively represent such a text-rhetoric; it "is" also "really" (even if also only metaphorically nameable) the fundamental disturbance that generates system conditions based on the principle "order from noise." Also and precisely, only the unity of composition and decomposition is reflexive. With flux et rdflux, "the ebb and flow" = "the tides," in the first part, one has have "wave-theoretically" and word for word what the second part (in so-called translation) psychologically calls "reflection." Here an epistemological concern enters the game. In the seventeenth cen- tury Thomas Willis (1621-1675) already refers the mechanical or wave- theoretical reflection as a metaphor to those direct and stimulus-responding muscle movements that in the nineteeth century are called "reflex movements." Because Willis clings to the concept of an inner- muscular nerve liquid, he gives the name "reflex-movement" to the muscle contractions provoked without consciousness by an exterior stimulus im- mediately after the reflection of light, sound and water-waves.24 What else can it mean when Rousseau says the exterior movements of the waves erased and replaced the interior movements? And yet, mechanical reflec- tion is used at another place in Rousseau expressly as metaphor for the temporary, the inner and bad reflection, which ties up irritatingly with the myth of history which opens the Diahkglues. The world of transparency</page><page sequence="11">The Rauschen of the Waves 31 crosses over into our world of opacity through the insertion of hindrances. The weakness of the soul is to be blamed for the fact that its actions, when they encounter a hindrance, let themselves be distracted/deflected [se detourne] "as a ball springs back into its angle of reflection."25 Physical reflection is the model of psychological reflection, after all. The Rauschen- disturbance or mirror in the fold between the two text-parts--owes its existence to (or even is itself) a reflection which can be dissolved in the direction of neither of the two sides. At this point one must have in view a sort of co-phenomenality of literary and psychiatric history. Already in the reflexively closed text in Rousseau's R~veries the many Leibnizian bruits in the "bruit des vagues" cannot be ignored. "Bruit" also means, in the triptych of Confessions- Dialogues-Rcveries, rumor, gossip, slander. Thus the talk of the conspiring others-in the Rveries the "bruit public" with which the newspapers reported his death after an accident at M nilmontant-rausches most bru- tally in Rousseau's ears.6 There are countless textualizations of this co-phenomenality in roman- tic literature. Wackenroder's "oriental saint" (1799) is among the early and optimistic case histories: the mad saint of this fairy tale believes that he hears "incessantly in his ears the wheel of time making its roaring revolu- tions," although he merely lived near a "little river." One senses what considerable progress heed and memory have made since Leibniz. And there is a cure for the audio-hallucination: as soon as the holy patient hears music (the temporal art) for the first time, he is healed.27 (The symptoms of the saint correspond to the medically circumscribed "fluctuatio aurium.")28 Many musical settings of romantic poems deal with and heal this sick- ness.29 Later and less optimistic is Baudelaire's "Obsession," a sonnet that, according to de Man, together with the manifesto of the "Correspondan- ces" forms a mirror-text. One strophe of "Obsession," however, remains without a correspondence: "Je te hais, Ocean! tes bonds et tes tumultes, / Mon esprit les retrouve en lui; ce rire amer / De l'homme vaincu, plein de sanglots et d'insultes, / Je l'entends dans le rire 6norme de la mer." ("My spirit hates you, Ocean! sees, and loathes / Its tumults in your own. Of men defeated / The bitter laugh, that's full of sob and oaths, / Is in your own tremendously repeated.")3" "Le rire amer"-"le rire de la mer": the Leibniz-Wundtian perception of Rauschen as something, now means, without any correspondance, being possessed by mother(-)hallucination. One must open the psychiatric files on audio-hallucinations in the later eighteenth and especially the nineteenth century. In 1826, the German physiologist Johannes Miller urges: "The subjective hearing sensations</page><page sequence="12">32 Riidiger Campe await a faithful self-observer, just as Goethe and Purkinje [1787-1869] per- formed for the subjective visual sensations."3' What could the point of the collaboration of poet and physiologist be? Two things: In contradistinction to the psychology of ideas [Vorstellungen], which is particularly captive to the model of optical perceptions, it concerns voices and stories. Bleuler reports that Gerrdusch-hallucinations ("blowing, rushing, buzzing, rustling") are in a pathological case usually beginnings of voice hallucinations ("whispering, calling, speaking").32 Kraepelin, the storyteller of paranoia, emphasizes that Ger'usche are pathologically heard as voices that call names or tell stories: "the coaches creak and sound in a most unusual manner and tell tales, the pigs grunt out names and stories."33 Second, for the Gerdusch-hallucination the dimension true/false or reality / deception is apparently not decisive, rather a dimension of inner/outer or projected/in- trojected: thus there was considerable debate as to whether and how one could distinguish between hearing-fantasies and hearing-hallucinations, and whether this distinction lines up with that of normal psychology and pathology. The reflexive text, that holds the Rauschen in its middle, is structurally involved with the history of the psychiatry of audio-hallucinations- beyond the speculation about a case study called Rousseau. Rauschen of the Channel Third: transmission/transposition. Once more it is the question of disturbance and pleasure; but not as the center of a text. Much more on the margins, as was the discourse-example of the word "Rauschen," it is now a matter of the fragile fact of the media-item Raluschen in narration. Kafka writes in a letter to Felice Bauer: From January 22 to 23, [19113. Very late dearest, and yet I shall go to bed without deserving it. Well, I won't sleep anyway, only dream. As I did yesterday, for example, when in my dream I ran toward a bridge or some balustrade, seized two telephone receivers (-Hriinnuschcln) that happened to be lying on the parapet (Briistung), put them to my ears, and kept asking (verlangtc) for nothing but news from "Pontus;" but nothing whatever came out of the telephone except a sad, mighty, wordless song and the Rauschen of the sea. Although well aware that it was impossible for human voices to penetrate these sounds, I didn't go away.4 This telling of a dream carefully inverts the thirteen-year-old psycho- analytical definition: a dream that does not guard sleep and continually fails to fulfill a desire. This dream-text, moreover, in its first half runs</page><page sequence="13">The Rauschen of the Waves 33 through a basic male object phantasy (-h'rwtnschel, Brfistung), only to ter- minate in apparently pure frustration of hearing. But what if the phantas- matic partial objects are already the frustration and it is a deferred pleasure to feminize oneself through the application of the telephone receiver, in that one "seizes two telephone Hdrmuschcln that happen to be lying on the Brfistung" and now awaits the arrival of the voices? And could it not be that waiting for the penetration of human voices only conceals the fact that "the wordless song and the Raiuschen of the sea" is already the whole pleasure, as the conjunction of intercourse [Verkehr] and disturbance?35 One can, however, neither psychologically nor genealogically hold on to the inversion nor hold it up: the point here is neither to make insinuations about Kafka's reversed intercourse [verkchrten Verkehr], nor to repeat Kafka's complaint that telephones reverse all intercourse and all inter- course participants. There is an unrestricted intercoursing and reversing of intercourse in the text called "Pontus." (It is Kafka who places the words in quotation marks.) If Kafka then alludes to Ovid's Litterae ex Ponto, then "Pontus" is, first of all, an exemplary dispatching place. Second, the Roman province Pontus, where Ovid was exiled, was so called because it was located on the Pontos, the Black Sea (delivering the famous example for euphemismn: pontos cuZxeinos for pontos axeinos). And third, the bridge (where the message about the pontos from Pontus is expected) is called in Latin pons, which hangs together with the Greek pontos (originally meaning "path"). "Pontos" is the unrestricted intercoursing of (acoustic) inter- course, marginless transmission: an inversion of the place of dispatch, medium, reception. The movement of the message, the causality between the message-techne and the psyche, and also the epics that tell about it, do not have beginning, middle, end. In The Castle, Kafka uses the telephonic conjunction invertedly (as "song and Rauschen") again. It concerns the connection between village and castle, which-as K. has already been told with regard to the street between village and castle-allows no "inter- course."" In the novel there is an epic representation of the reasons. The following is related: In guesthouses and the like, the telephone may serve some useful purposes, something like a jukebox [Musikautomatl, and it is certainly not more than that [.. .] In the castle, the telephone functions superbly; as I have been told, there is uninterrupted telephoning there [...] We hear this uninterrupted telephoning as the Rauschen and the singing in our telephones here [...]37 In The Castle one finds in the place of the marginless medium an inversion of telephone history up to Kafka's time:</page><page sequence="14">34 Ri'diger Campe 1) The telephone as jukebox in the village. Here it apparently concerns the apparatus for the conversion of electrical into acoustic impulses. 2) The village-castle telephonic connection between (in every case) one telephone (in the village) and all or any telephones (in the castle). Here it concerns the technical layout of a point-to-point connection (even if radial). 3) The connection among the telephones in the castle: an extended network with switching devices and relays. The telephone historian identifies the following periods: "1. The telephone as physical apparatus (1861-1876); 2. The telephone as technical device (1876-1881); 3) Local telephone exchanges and international telephone communication (1881-191I)."'S The periodization stands in rela- tion to the epic report in The Castle like a sequence of messages does to so-called "Nebensprechen" or "Ubersprechen" (the inductive coupling of neighboring lines).: Kafka introduces the telephone-technical (that is, the transmission- technical) effect of "Nebensprechen," which produced Rauschen and sing- ing in telephone receivers before Pupin, as a simultaneity and reversal of media-historical periods. That was already the case in the "Pontus" dream: five days before the letter about the "Pontus" dream, Kafka writes Felice Bauer about leafing through a volume of the magazine Gartenlaube. In that volume there is an essay about the Reis telephone (the article is partially identical with Reis's introductory lecture of 1865). The reader learns that the Reis telephone had only been able to convey musical tones and singing. While Hughes's theory of the contact microphone stated that continual impulse transmission can only transform speech curves through changes in contact pressure, Reis's intermittent contact could not. (Successful cases of speaking on the Reis telephone were therefore, in terms of his concep- tion, merely accidents.) Also in the "Pontus" dream, Kafka introduces the effect of the marginless medium-singing and Rauschen-through the simultaneity and inversion of two phases of invention: here not with refer- ence to the total system (as in the novel), but rather with reference to the actual technique of transformation. Kafka reports from the history of invention when he reports about telephonic hearing, and he tells the story of the medium when he addresses both the telephonic connection and the impossibility of so-called ex- perience of the technical medium. The rhetoric of the inversions (of rever- sal, simultaneity, "Ubersprechen") can be called a narrative rhetoric. As in the textual figuration (e.g. Rousseau's text on the bruit of the waves), it concerns conditions of speaking and hearing; but as in the traditional persuasive rhetoric (as criticized by Leibniz) this rhetoric deals with certain</page><page sequence="15">The Rauschen of the Waves 35 effects of speaking and hearing that remain exterior to the question of representation in language. The narration on the technical device of com- munication is precisely about the exteriority of certain conditions and ef- fects in speaking and hearing to representation in language. "Singing and Rauisclhen" lead to two fields of enquiry that lie close together. The one has to do with "jukeboxes," to speak with Kafka, in the pre-history of the medium. Reis, for example, bases his concept of intermit- tent contact on the physiological studies of tone conducted by Helmholtz, who experimented with tone producers made of a tuning fork and a resonator. References to physiological experiments with tone can also be found in Alexander Graham Bell and other inventors of the telephone. With Bell, the pre-history reaches back literally to music and speaking machines such as the Kempel machine (which made its appearance in E.T.A. Hoffmann's "Automate"). On the other hand, since approximately the middle of the nineteenth century the experimental analysis of tone and voice speaks of the Rauschen of the waves as a way of visualizing acoustic theory. Helmholtz himself at the beginning of his Theory of the Sensations of Tone poetically and meticulously describes the "scene" that offers, for ob- servers of interference, the "ocean surface, seen from a high bank," "at the point when, after strong winds, it begins once again to calm itself."40 After his gaze has pursued its reflections according to the nature of the various inlet formations along the bank, he narrates the "very similar scene" that one must imagine as "inside, as in something like a ballroom." "Musical instruments, speaking people, rustling [rausclhende] clothes, sweeping feet, clinking glasses": "All of these stimulate waves that shoot through the space of the room, are thrown against the walls, reverse,..., until they are exhausted." Enquiries into "Singing and Razuschen" thus proceed toward the physical-physiological study of acoustics, and also toward the techni- cal-apparative study of voice. (In the experimental early phase of the medium these two were immediately connected.) They uncovered behind the psychological idea of tone and Raiischen the tone and the Rauschen as scientific objects, the latter of which can only be produced, i.e. brought into scientific being, by the technology of experimental science. Only in this moment can one have a Rauschenc as the referent of the word "Rauschen." But this referent inverts linguistic reference itself. Kafka's conjunction of "singing and Rauischen," "Raziscihen and singing" is itself formed "as in the course of plummeting [wie im Abstnrz]." The "wordless singing" in the "singing telephones" of Philipp Reis is nonetheless only a Rauschen, i.e., no transmission of language. The Raulschen in the telephones of the castle is nonetheless a singing, an acoustic phenomenon that comprehends all lan-</page><page sequence="16">36 Riidiger Campe guages. What is it about? At a meeting in the 1920's attended by experts from the Comit&amp; Consultatif International and engineers of American Telephone and Telegraph Co., the attempt was made--even though with unsatisfactory results-to establish a "transmission unit" for telephone operations. Various methods for measuring power losses in the transmis- sion system were taken into consideration. Twenty to thirty years later, an employee of AT&amp;T's research division, Claude Shannon, defined and cal- culated a precisely opposite "transmission unit": that of information. A re-orientation was made from the technologist's hunt for attenuation and distortion effects in the system to chance selection belonging to the system proper in the relation of sender/receiver and channel.41 Rauschen is a "referent" for the numerical value of statistics. That is the final figure of "Rauschen." A circulation: from thle discourse-ordering of literature (the synec- doche bruit as discourse element) to the theory of information (the Rauschen proper to media as the prerequisite for selection). Discourse is the battle of signs at the limit of movements; information measures itself as the pos- sibility of selection. In between, there were and there are texts: discourses that represent the limits of their discursivity in themselves. This sketch shows historical indices; it tells no history. Rather, it concerns the topology of margins. Rauschen (word, figure, thling) is word, figure, thing of this topology. Johns Hopkins University Translated by Simon Richter NOTES 1.

For the belatedness see Leibniz in the letter to the French translator of Locke, Pierre Coste: "...sa mort (i.e., Locke's) m'a rebutd et a fait que mes reflexions sont demeurbes en arritre, quoyqu'elles soyent achevtes." (Leibniz to Coste No. III, in Leibniz, vol. 3, 390). Leibniz had already distributed the roles of Aristotle and Plato among Locke and himself in Sur l'Essay de l'entendement humain de Monsieur Locke: "Je suis nullement pour la Tabula rasa d'Aristote; et il y a quelque chose de solide dans ce que Platon appelloit la reminiscence."

One must assume that this passage was especially mean- ingful for Leibniz: here Locke is deeply concerned with questions of memory, and that gives Leibniz in his first notes the idea of the Platonic role.

Accordingly one can find in the French translation by Pierre Coste, after which Leibniz composed his answer to Locke: "Supposons un Enfant qui ait I'usage de ses yeux jusqu'8 ce qu'il connoisse &amp; distingue les Couleurs, mais qu'alors les cataractes venant ? fermer I'entr~ e i la lumibre...."
