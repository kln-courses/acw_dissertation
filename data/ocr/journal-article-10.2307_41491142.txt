One approach consists of a textualized bibliography, name-and-concept dropping wherever feasible in a historical perspective. The unwritten law implicit to this approach is to assert the temporal continuity of knowledge and the causal cohesion of the semiotic dis- course. Although I am prepared to concede the limited utility of the above type of bibliographical survey, I am not completely convinced that such a genealogical inter- pretation is suitable for a critical discourse aiming to be a 'science.* I have therefore opted for the second approach which is to present a conceptual sketch of a small num- ber of works that seem to me at once fundamental and representative of the semiotic approach to the narrative. Ideally, this approach presupposes a thorough study of an extensive number of works and an examination of all the concepts used in the field. From this kind of theoretical inventory one could at least be sure about sifting out the most basic and constitutive concepts. Falling short of this ideal, it still seemed important and worthwhile to try to infer them in the belief that a relatively small number of concepts constitute the epistemological groundwork of any discipline. Four operational concepts are put forth in Part I as founding narrative semiotics. These are among the first postulates and presuppositions which provide the organi- zational schema to Part II where we consider the individual contributions from lead- ing figures in France. Part III looks at the communicational aspect of the narrative and seeks to correlate the conceptual terminology derived from information science with the concepts, models, and procedures presented throughout the first two parts.</page><page sequence="2">1 90 THERESE BUDNI AKIEWICZ I. BASIC THEORETICAL CONCEPTS Four basic concepts provide the keynote to the semiotic study of the narra- tive: 1) story vs. discourse; 2) narrative as a connotative semiotic; 3) deep structures vs. surface structures; 4) syntagmatics vs. paradigmatics. They are sufficiently general and maneuverable to allow a multiple framing of a vast field in the making. They have been extolled more completely and more consistently than other concepts of equal importance. As a result, they are a part of a fixed operational stock which underlies an area of semiotics that is already relatively settled and partially consol- idated. These two criteria, extensive usage and established basis, have dictated my choice of the basic concepts retained here and, by the same token, those which were left out from primary consideration such as, for example, the distinction between énoncé vs. énonciation, which is in full elaboration at the moment. Experimental concepts which have not been as thoroughly tested for their heuristic value and dis- covery procedures in the specific domain of narrative semiotics will be mentioned in passing. They often, though not always, designate highly problematic areas of narrative knowledge which resist a firm analytic grip. It seems useful to begin by briefly defining the concepts first and then locat- ing the individual works and contributions within their scope. The discussion will attempt to present a simplified description of each concept, omitting many details. Readers may consult the references listed in each section for a more complete and adequate account. The major object in this introductory part is to orient the reader quickly into an initial and approximative theoretical mapping of the field. The gen- eral treatment of the individual works and contributions as well as more specific problems will reiterate in more detail the generalized and summarizing concepts. 1.1 story vs. discourse An analytical procedure which has already become classical in narrative semi- otics makes the fundamental distinction between two levels of representation and analysis: that of story and discourse. If the narrative text as a whole is viewed as a complex sign-function, the first stage of analysis must consist of splitting its two con- stituent and interdependent entities, the expression plane and the content plane or the signifying and the signified- in Hjelmslev'sand Saussure's terms, respectively- and subjecting each plane separately to a segmentation and systematization of the units that are manifested and being constructed, lhe analysis of the expression plane is located at an apparent level of textual manifestation and the analysis of the con- tent plane at the immanent level wherein narrativity is found and organized prior to its materialization through a linguistic or other type of medium. This first step in analytical procedure was taken nearly by all, if not all, analysts concerned with the theory of the narrative, also called narratology (Genette, 1973 :68). All critics who contributed to Communications No. 8 containing the "prin- cipal manifesto of [the] structuralist" (Scholes, 1974:216) study of narration, in- spired by linguistics, have postulated the decomposition of the narrative sign-function</page><page sequence="3">A CONCEPTUAL SURVEY OF NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS 1 9 1 into at least two levels which have acquired a welter of names but cover essentially the same distinction. Each narrative (= récit) can be considered as a story (histoire) or as a discourse (discours). To study the narrative as a story isto study the narrative content plane or the signified which subsumes functional plot events as a logic of actions, the formation of actional sequences, and a syntax of agents and actants. To study the narrative as discourse is to study the expression plane or the signifying as a real speech addressed by the narrator to the reader. To proceed from the level of discourse is to focus on the means the narrator has used to let us know the story and analyze not only style in the narrow sense but, more generally, all the various tech- niques of narration: temporality, aspects, and modes. 1.2 narrative as a connotative semiotic Each semiotic postulates a relationship between two planes, the expression plane and the content plane. But narrative and, in general, all literary and mythical texts are complex systems of a higher order than the linguistic system upon which they are built. Viewing the narrative from this angle, Barthes (1957, 1964) has dis- cussed the "staggered" systems of signification and, in part, what he calls, following Hjelmslev (1943, 1969), connotative semiotics . This refers to a system of significa- tion whose plane of expression is itself constituted of a system of signification. Barthes illustrates this by means of a diagram: Denotative 1. signifying 2. signified (linguistic) semiotics 3. sign I. SIGNIFYING II. SIGNIFIED Connotative semiotics III. SIGN Linearly, the system is represented in Hjelmslev's notation as (E R С ) R C, where E is the expression plane, С the content plane, and Rthe relationship of the two planes. Since a connotative system is a system of the second order, Greimas (1970:95) ar- gues further that the model which will account for its complexity will have to include four different planes at two levels : at the level of linguistic form on the expression plane (or phonological) on the content plane (or grammatical) at the level of non linguistic substance on the expression plane (or the phonetic "purport") on the content plane (or the semantic "purport")</page><page sequence="4">192 THERESE BUDNIAKIEWICZ 1.3 deep structures vs. surface structures Although it is cautiously wise to keep in mind that beyond the first step of analysis each narrative grammar or each narrative theory currently being elaborated establishes its own sub-levels in accordance to criteria dictated by their theoretical and pragmatic aims, the writing practice of many researchers attests to the violation of methodological purity by interpolating the terminology and levels of description set up by taxonomie linguistics -structural, distributional, descriptive, and others-- with those in transformational generative linguistics. In seeking to integrate the exist- ing models and partial results acquired from other semiotic domains such as linguis- tics, logic, anthropology , leading practitioners are constantly reinterpreting them with the objective of constructing (a) narrative grammar(s). As long as "the methodologi- cal tools which discursive semiotics now marshalls do not yet correspond to the re- quirements made by the analysis of literary texts" (Greimas, 1976b:9), theoretical adulteration will take place and competing terminological concepts will tend to commingle. Thus, to take just one example, the reasoning in the following quote rests on the proposition that the levels of story and deep structures are roughly the same and likewise for the levels of discourse and surface structures: The basic story , considered as a sequence of transformations of deep struc- tures, does not exclude. . . its projection on the axis of temporality [on the level of surface temprality] where the story considered as discourse recovers its durations, its punctuations, and its tensions (Greimas, 1976b: 26, my under- lining). The distinction between deep structures and surface structures is borrowed, of course, from generative transformational grammar where it plays the role of a basic axiom. For Chomsky (1965:16) the central idea of a grammar is that deep and surface structures are distinct and that the surface structure is deter- mined by repeated applications of certain formal operations called "grammati- cal transformations" to objects of a more elementary sort. If this is true (as I assume, henceforth), then the syntactic component must generate deep and sur- face structures, for each sentence, and must interrelate them. To talk, therefore, of deep structures and surface structures on the sentential as well as the textual and narrative level entails the existence of a generative transfor- mational component whose major function would be "to convert an abstract deep structure that expresses the content of a sentence [or a text] into a fairly concrete structure that indicates its form" (Chomsky, 1965:136). Needless to say, much re- mains vague about the semantic deep structures and even less is known about the exact steps involved in going from the deep structure to the surface structure. This fact, however, does not prevent critics from resorting to categories of generative linguistics. It would seem that simply mentioning the terms deep and surface struc- tures has the force of exorcising an implicit generative process lacking in the demon- stration. The most serious and comprehensive attempt to construct the framework</page><page sequence="5">A CONCEPTUAL SURVEY OF NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS 193 of a textual grammar patterned after recent models of generative semantics and syn- tactics has been made by Van Dijk (1 972). The global task of the new Text-Grammar is to formulate the rules describing deep semantic macro-structures and the rules re- lating such macro-structures with sequential surface structures of any text. Before proceeding to the fourth concept we would like to glance once more over the binary concepts introduced thus far. If Greimas's procedure of equating story with deep structures and discourse with surface structures is a legitimate way of theorizing, our next step would be to pursue the same type of correlation a little further and maintain that the components of Barthes's and Greimas's systems and Van Dijk's Text -Grammar can also be roughly equated. The diagram of these approxi- mate correspondences is given below. Barthes Greimas Van Dijk Linguistic 1. signifying 1 linguistic E plane sentential surface structures structures (1st order) 2. signified 2 linguistic С plane sentential deep structures Semiotic- 3. SIGNIFYING I non-linguistic textual surface structures textual E plane (micro -component) structures 4. SIGNIFIED II non-linguistic textual deep structures (2nd order) С plane (macro-component) The entries in each of the four rows may be said to refer to the same level of opera- tion. Researchers interested in the study of actional plot events would generally agree that their level of procedure can be labelled the signified of the second order, the non-linguistic content plane, textual deep structures, or that of story. If the semi- otic system being considered is the narrative, row 3, as the reader will recognize, pin- points the level of discourse and row 4 that of story. 1.4 syntagmatics vs. paradigmatics In the introduction to Propp's seminal work Morphology of the Folktale , Dundes (1968:xi) distinguished two types of narrative structural analysis: the syntagmatic type exemplified by Propp and the paradigmatic type whose founder and greatest proponent is Lévi-Strauss. Before considering the enormous impact which Propp and Lévi-Strauss exercised on later studies of folklore and narrative, we shall give a brief exposition of syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations in their theoretical and abstract sense, followed by the types of structural analyses which were labelled after them. The purpose for presenting the general and simpler case first is to bring out the kinds of difficulties raised when facing the more complex narrative text and to provide the background which motivated Dundes's nomen- clature. The kind of operation Lévi-Strauss performs in his famous article "The Struc- tural Study of Myth" (1958a:235-6; 1963:209-10) on a sequence of numbers pro- vides an intuitive shortcut to grasping the notions of syntagmatic and paradigmatic</page><page sequence="6">1 94 THERESE BUDNI AKIEWICZ relations. Given a numerical sequence of the type 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 1, 2, 5, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 to find the syntagmatic and paradigmatic ordering is to re-arrange the set of numbers in a matrix such that the linear sequence when read from left to right and row by row would be maintained and each column would con- tain the same number: 1 2 4 7 8 2 3 4 6 8 1 4 5 7 8 12 5 7 3 4 5 6 8 The operation involves two methods of arrangement : syntagmatic ordering by row in which each unit appears in combination with other units building up an ordered nu- merical sequence; paradigmatic ordering by column produced on the basis of equality or identity of the given units. Obviously , the interpretation of the linguistic and semi- otic sign-function along these two modes of arrangement will no longer be 'trivial' because: 1) The découpage or partition of the syntagmatic chain, the speech chain or linear sentence into its constituent parts cannot be defined a priori. For the given numerical sequence the unit is clearly any positive integer from 1 to 8. What shall constitute a linguistic unit? A narrative unit? One of the most difficult problems of any structural study of the narrative is precisely that of isolating the operational units or elementary constituents which can be manipulated and on which analytic procedures can be performed. "Defining the Narrative Units" (Cf. Culler, 1975b) con- stitutes a crucial first step within any adopted system of investigation. 2) Assuming that we did know what a unit was for any extended syntagm, to account for the sequential order or combination of these units and to establish the rules which link them would neither be simple nor evident. Introducing levels of description means that a linguistic unit functions at the same time as context to simpler units or becomes integrated into a more complex unit on a higher level. 3) The classement or articulation of the paradigmatic system by its members is not produced on the basis of absolute equality (1=1=1... wherever it occurs). For a linguistic/textual semiotic system, it will have to be based on similarity, synonymy and antonymity. The paradigmatic relation involves a selection between alternative terms, the possibility of substituting one member for another which is equivalent in some aspects and different in others. The syntagmatic ordering is taken up by Dundes to characterize the Proppian approach to the narrative and the paradigmatic ordering to the Lévi-Straussian ap- proach. A brief outline of the two approaches will point to the nature of the syntag- matic and paradigmatic unit in the narrative. Syntagmatic analysis selects for its basic units the actions of the main characters, called functions by Propp, and exam- ines the sequential order in which they manifest themselves in a text. Functions con- stitute the basic, constant units of the text and lead to uncovering the invariant sys-</page><page sequence="7">A CONCEPTUAL SURVEY OF NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS 195 tem. In Propp's words, each function is a generic unit subsuming many species. Thus, each concrete action is mapped onto a certain function which is coded by a noun, such as 'Departure', 'Villainy', 'Struggle', etc. The function 'Villainy' for instance can be a kidnapping, a theft, a plunder, an injury. The specific act does not matter as long as it contributes to plot progression and makes the next function in the syntagmatic chain emerge. The results of Propp's analysis on a corpus of 100 Russian fairy tales are striking. Any tale can be represented by a small sequence of 31 functions which always occur in the same, relatively fixed, consecutive order. Paradigmatic analysis looks for semantic (thematic) categories which may be widely separated on the syn- tagmatic chain and groups them in oppositions specifiable by a matrix of binary fea- tures. The typical paradigmatic matrix in Lévi-Strauss, which he names schema (1958b) is one in which polar oppositions such as life / death, male / female, raw / cooked are mediated. Whereas syntagmatic analysis is temporal, diachronic, linear, partaking of syntax, the paradigmatic analysis is non-temporal, achronic, vertical, manifesting an organization of axiological structures which signal the meaningful articulations of the narrative semantic world. Both the syntagmatic and paradigmatic structural analyses, which should be viewed as complementary rather than mutually exclusive, obtain their basic narrative units from the story level. The units, functions and schémas, are organized in such a way as to form an underlying structure, abstracted from the concrete textual mani- festation. Hence, both types of structural analyses operate on the deep macro-struc- tures of the narrative (Cf. Hendricks, 1973: ch.7). In his critique of Propp's Morphol- ogy Lévi-Strauss (1960, 1973) conceives his polemic against Propp as that of a structuralist against a formalist or, more specifically, as that of a deep schematic analyst against a superficial linear analyst (Cf. Dundes in Propp, 1968:xii). The major thrust of Lévi-Strauss's argument is misleading for reasons we cannot justify in the limits of this survey. It will suffice to note the recurrent nature of Propp's function and its status as a unit belonging to deep structure, not to surface struc- ture, i.e. to "form," as Lévi-Strauss would suggest. II. NARRATIVE LEVELS AND PROCEDURES IIJ historical note Propp's work which was published in Russian in 1928 was not translated into French until 1970, lagging twelve years behind the English translation. And yet, ironically, Propp's Morphology has exercised its greatest impact in France. The stimu- lating effect of this study is indicated by the number of remarkable publications it has inspired in France. In 1966 a special issue of Communications came out devoted entirely to the "Analyse structurale du récit". Most of the contributors made refer- ence to Propp's analysis and attempted to give more rigor to his methodology with the conceptual tools of structural linguistics (Saussure, Hjelmslev, Ben veniste) and basic logic (Blanché). An important book by Greimas Sémantique structurale also appeared in 1966, containing two chapters on narrative models, the result of synthe-</page><page sequence="8">1 96 THERESE BUDNI AKIEWICZ sizing Propp's syntagmatics with Lévi-Strauss's paradigmatics. Ten years later, in 1976, after having refined these models, Greimas assesses them by an extensive book- length application to a short story by Maupassant: "Despite the complexity of the literary tale, as compared to the oral tale, despite the introduction of very many new variables, the stability of Propp's general narrative schema is astounding" (Greimas, 1 976b :115). The range of Propp's extraordinary conclusions widens. His narrative model is held valid not only for fairy tales but can also be manipulated to yield a "hypothetical, but also universal, model of the organization of narrative and figura- tive discourses" (Greimas, 1976b : 1 1) including the more sophisticated literary texts. The year 1 966 can probably be fixed as the beginning of narrative semiotics in France. II .2 the story II. 2.1 syntagmatic units and levels The respect shown to great precursors should not lead us into the error of thinking that narrative syntagmatics once initiated by Propp was established once and for all. Propp's function "defined from the point fo view of its significance for the course of the action" (Propp, 1968:21) was restricted to fairy tales when first postulated and it had to be generalized for prose fiction or, as we prefer to call it, the narrative. In his recent careful re-examination of Propp's work Hendricks (1975) discusses the "notoriously complex, polysemantic" concept of the function and ar- gues that it provides the basis for two fundamentally different conceptions of narra- tive structure. The two types of post-Proppian plot analysis, as exemplified in the work of Bremond and Greimas, have each isolated one of two tendencies coexisting in Propp's approach. "The ambiguity of 'function,' " says Hendricks (1975:282) "is manifested in the fact that both retain Propp's term and both characterize their ap- proach as 'functional analysis' of narrative." Propp's procedure is also shown to be arbitrary and inconsistent. The failure to specify clearly the criteria separating func- tional elements from non-functional elements was a problem that post-Proppian structuralists had to deal with. The first set of contributions to the problem of defining narrative functions and of distinguishing functional and non-functional elements in the plot were pub- lished in Communications No. 8 (1966). All of the articles contained in this special issue concerned themselves to one degree or another with specifying the smallest narrative units, accounting for the functional syntax by which the units combine to form the narrative syntagm, and outlining the major operational levels of analytic procedure, those of story and discourse. In his "Introduction à l'analyse structurale des récits," Barthes (1 966b) separated the two types of functional units, th e functions in Propp's sense from the indices. Functions are said to be of two kinds, kernels which constitute genuine nodes or hinges of the story and the catalysts which fill in and elaborate some kernel. In conjunction with Barthes's "Introduction. . ." should be read the invaluable analysis by Chatman (1969) who has applied Barthes's theoretical</page><page sequence="9">A CONCEPTUAL SURVEY OF NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS 197 concepts to a brief 'psychological' short story, Joyce's "Evelyne." The empirical testing of the model has the advantage of posing in its short compass some of the main problems which arise in narrative syntagmatics. Bremond (1966) stressed the importance of the notion of sequence in his article "La Logique des possibles narra- tifs". The elementary sequence is a triad of functions which correspond to the three 4enses' marking the development of any process: visualization, development, and completion of action. In an attempt to delimit the field of the 'narratable' Bremond postulates that each function must provide an embryonic bifurcation, an alternative of 'logical possibilities.' Such a function, called pivot-function , allows alternative op- tions at each moment of the narrative by anticipating a future which may or may not be realized. Bremond's pivot-function has been tried out by Hendricks on a short story by Ambrose Bierce, "Oil of Dog," and a relatively self-contained part of the Ray Bradbury novel Something Wicked This Way Comes (Cf. Hendricks, 1972). Hendricks's sample analyses are more serviceable than Bremond's own which deal solely with small fragments, lines and sentences, from LaFontaine's Fables , A Thou- sand and One Nights , Edgar Allan Poe's short stories and fairy tales (Bremond, 1 973a, 1973b, 1977). In his "Catégories du récit littéraire" Todorov gives a summary of three approaches to the logic of action: Bremond's triadic model, Lé vi- Strauss 's ho- mological model and the law of repetition from classical poetics. Todorov (1 969) was concerned with applying Proppian analysis to the Decam- eron in his book Grammaire du Décameron in order to present a general theory of narration which he casts in the form of a 'universal' grammar. He sets up a system of primary categories, the narrative parts of speech (proper noun, adjective, and verb) and secondary categories which are the properties of the narrative parts (mood, voice, negation and opposition, etc.). The system of categories, combined with the propo- sition, the basic unit of the narrative, and sequences of propositions yield a kind of "archi-story," similar to a plot summary, "which may facilitate a better understanding of the concrete story" (1969:18). Greimas's article "Eléments d'une grammaire narrative" (1969) provides the most systematic and clearest exposition of the author's theory on 'narrativity' and it extends the field of application beyond that of the mythical tale investigated in the Communications collection (Cf. 1966a). Having rephrased the opposition be- tween story and discourse as that between immanent narrative structures and appar- ent figurative manifestations, Greimas introduces a new distinction within the study of narration which corresponds to a fundamental grammar and a surface grammar. Any narrative when seen from one level can be represented in terms of purely logical, conceptual operations of the canonical type F(A) where F is the function and A the subject, designated as an actant; and, on another more perceivable level, approaching that of linguistic manifestation, the narrative can be interpreted as a sequence of tasks and trials enacted by anthropomorphic beings who personify the concepts and their transformations. Since neither stage involves sentences from an actual text I would suggest tentatively to view the two grammars as notational variants of the same deep structural level. In Greimas's terminology a unit from the fundamental grammar passes on to the corresponding unit of surface grammar by means of a trans-coding</page><page sequence="10">1 98 THERESE BUDNI AKIEWICZ or re-conversion. Using this term at the meta-level, that is, referring to a critical discourse rather than to its object-language the narrative, we can say that Greimas's (1971) essay "Narrative Grammar: Units and Levels" briefly sketches the 'reconver- sion' of the above narrative grammar into a grammar with generative-transformational components. II.2.2 the actantial category: the status of 'character' Structural analysis, as Barthes (1966b: 16) says, "very anxious not to define the character in terms of psychological essences, has attempted thus far, through various hypotheses, to define the character not as a 'being,' but as a 'participant' " within a sphere of actions. The different conceptions of the 'character' can be found in the contributions of Communications No. 8 and in the subsequent work of these researchers. The study of character raises numerous problems which are far from being resolved. We will, arbitrarily, single out one interesting model proposed by Greimas which has been greatly elaborated since its initial conception in 1966 (Cf. Greimas, 1966b :ch. 10). The actantial model was extrapolated from Propp's distribution of dramatis personae and corroborated both by Souriau's inventory of theatrical/dramatic char- acters and linguistic categories. It consists of six actantial categories set in syntactic and semantic relation to one another. The small number of actants is claimed to be sufficient to account for the underlying organization of a micro-narrative. The model is represented as follows: Sender Object ►Receiver Helper &gt; Subject« Opponent The notion of actant is essentially functional. The character is defined by a "sphere of actions" in which he/she participates, the spheres of actions, in turn, being con- stituted by a network of functions that are attributed to the character. A priori, within the framework of the narrative seen as a whole, the function presupposes the actant but a posteriori, within a micro -universe, an exhaustive inventory constitutes the ac- tant (Greimas, 1 966b : 1 22). Greimas stresses that the actant is "not only the denomi- nation of an axiological content but also a classematic basic instituting it as a pos- sibility of process" (1966b: 186). The function is viewed as a "described dynamism" as opposed to the actant characterized by a "force of inertia" which makes it capable of executing a narrative program. In still other terms, the actant is an isotope of the function in the same way that the agent is an isotope of the verb: for example, singer - to sing. (Cf. Greimas, 1970:168). The first theoretical proposal differentiated the actant from the actort the latter being recognizable at the discourse level and partaking of a semantic nature. In his 1973 article, "Les Actants, les acteurs et les figures," Greimas reworked his model extensively to account for the "complexity of the narrative problematic"</page><page sequence="11">A CONCEPTUAL SURVEY OF NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS 199 inherent in the status of the fictional character. Adding the modalities of wanting j being able /knowing and undertaking to span the gap between the actant and its dis- cursive manifestations, Greimas outlines a compact and systematic model, involving many interweaving components labeled actant, actantial role, actor, thematic role, figures, discursive configurations, all of which are used in the semiotic analysis of Maupassant (Greimas, 1976b; see also Greimas, 1976c). The seminal ideas embodied in Greimas's theoretical writings made a singular imprint on his followers whose contributions often clarify and expand upon his suc- cinct expositions while delineating new paths of research into narratology . Especially noteworthy for its lucidity is Genot's Analyse structurelle de "Pinocchio" (1970). Two other works markedly influenced by Greimas include Rastier's collection of ar- ticles, Essais de sémiotique discursive (1973), and an article by Hamon, "Pour un statut sémiologique du personnage" (1972). II.2.3 paradigmatizing the syntagmatics "A la recherche des modèles de transformation", chapter 11 of Greimas's (1966b) Sémantique structurale re-examines Propp's inventory of functions and re- duces their number from 31 to 20 by means of an achronic and paradigmatic inter- pretation of the relations holding between functions. This reduction is stated to be valid only because the relation of implication existing between two functions in the syntagmatic chain (non s - &gt;s) can be transformed by disjunction into the semantic content of paired functions (s vs. non s). The paired functions when correlated by a paradigmatic relation are independent of theme developments and of syntagmatic sequences. Functions which are spread far apart on the syntagmatic chain such as, for example, lack ¡misfortune at the beginning of the tale and liquidation of lack at the end, are seen to belong to the same "structure of meaning" (1966b:206). Corre- lating them allows us to perceive the meaning of the tale as a whole and to interpret it as a simple, coherent, achronic structure. Greimas's investigations lead him to two major conclusions: (1) that the syntagmatic sequence, called trial (l'épreuve) consis- ting of a contract, a struggle, and a consequence, is the irreducible diachronic kernel of the tale ; (2) that the simple paradigmatic structure of the tale is composed of two homologous and functional substructures, A vs. A, contract vs. rupture of contract and С vs. Ü, communication vs. alienation. Two different modes of reading are thus possible. One mode makes it possible to grasp the terms paradigmatically and to es- tablish the correlation between two categories: ã . с Ä ~ с The other reading accounts for the temporal syntagmatic arrangement of the terms which are associated by implication (1966b: 208): (Ã &gt;C)s( С &gt; A) Greimas applies his interpretation of Propp's 'narrative model' to a Bororo myth taken from Lévi-Strauss's Le Cru et le cuit in another article setting forth the basic theory and methodology of myth analysis. (We shall return to this article in III.4).</page><page sequence="12">200 THERESE BUDNIAKIEWICZ Genot (1970) and Rastier (1973) also fall within this perspective. On the American continent Hendricks's syntagmatic plot analysis (Cf. esp. Hendricks, 1977), developed independently, shares many traits in common with this type of structural analysis. II. 2 .4 a classification of structural narratology The introductory section which precedes Barthes's analysis of ten lines from the Genesis (1971b) includes the author's division of structural analysis into "roughly three types": 1) indexical analysis (l'analyse indicielle) which makes an inventory of the "psychological" attributes of fictional characters including biographical traits, personality, and social features and classifies connotative signifìeds. On the sentence level this type of analysis corresponds to the adjective; 2) actantial analysis which pro- ceeds to classify the functions of characters, what they do as subject of a constant action: the Sender, the Quester, the Sendee, etc. On the sentence level this corre- sponds to the present participle ; 3) sequential analysis classifies actions which com- bine to form sequences that are ordered by a pseudo-logic. Propp's analysis, which would fall in this category, is set apart as a special type, called functional analysis al- though, as Barthes himself observes, the same label could also be used to define actan- tial analysis (1 971b :37). On the sentence level, this last type corresponds to the verb. Indexical analysis is closely associated, if not identified with, the textual anal- ysis Barthes practices on a short story by Balzac, "Sarrasine," in his well-known and fascinating book S/Z (1 970). It corresponds to one of the five codes which govern our reading of the narrative text and which Barthes calls the semantic code. In the very same article Barthes admits that "my own work is oriented in a somewhat different fashion" and "belongs more to textual analysis than to structural analysis" (1971b: 36). The areas of structural analysis clearly fall into two major domains, one con- cerned with the morphology and the syntax of the narrative, and the other with semantics. We have used the syntagmatic -paradigmatic distinction to capture this division although this terminological differentiation also appears arbitrary. If Propp's syntagmatic analysis can be subjected to 'paradigmatic' interpretation, the difference between Proppian and Lévi-Straussian structural analyses is blurred unless we agree to reinterpret syntagmatic analysis as synonymous with functional analysis and para- digmatic analysis with qualifying analysis in the sense given to them by Greimas (1966b: 172). Whatever the label, syntagmatic structure would basically be the same as plot structure and paradigmatic structure comparable to the grouping of thematic and symbolic meanings. The basic methodology underlying both types of structural analysis manipu- lates deep narrative structures at the story level. This is the level where narrative semiotics appears to have succeeded in securing a firm methodological footing, es- pecially with regard to syntagmatic organization which, need we add, "does not refer to a fixed, sure knowledge nor to definite acquisitions, but to a means of approaching the text, procedures of its segmentation, the recognition of some regularities and, above all, models of predictability on narrative organization" (Greimas, 1976b:7).</page><page sequence="13">A CONCEPTUAL SURVEY OF NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS 201 II.3 the discourse II.3.1 Genette's discourse theory and analysis The second and larger section of Genette 's Figures III ( 1973), as indicated by the title "Discours du récit: essai de méthode," deals essentially with narrative dis- course. It is one of the most significant contributions to the theory of discursive structures and a fascinating derivation of it from the textual analysis of Proust. Part of its value derives from the thorough reorganization of an enormous body of con- cepts, terms, and phenomena which have evolved separately in French, Anglo-Ameri- can,and German theoretical traditions of prose fiction. Scholes (1974:164) believes that Genette's work "will become a standard text in this field, the point of departure for future studies of fictional poetics." The achievement of reconstruction is only surpassed by the fusion of abstract structural and theoretical models developed there- in with a hermeneutic exploration of the concrete Proustian text. To this day only two other brilliant attempts have been made at bridging the two modes of cognizing the narrative text, the structural and the phenomenological : S/Z by Barthes (1970) and Maupassant by Greimas (1976b). Until an English translation becomes available, two review articles by Mosher (1976) and Rimmon (1976) and the accounts of it in Scholes and Culler (1975a) will acquaint the English reader with the breadth and scope of Genette's discourse theory. Genette begins his investigation by suggesting that the narrative (=rêcit) con- sists of three distinct methodological levels: the story, the discourse, and the narra- tion. The third level introduced by Genette is based on a distinction formulated by Benveniste (1966:ch.l9,21 ; 1974:ch.5) between the énoncé and the énonciation which has been variously translated, though unsatisfactorily, as utterance/uttering, statement/enunciation, utterance/enunciation. Because the English terms trigger some misleading connotations, we shall retain the French terms. The énoncé is an objective statement or an actualized utterance whereas the énonciation is the language act which produces the énoncé (Benveniste, 1974:80) and it involves the subjective elements in language, including Jakobson's "shifters" (See Jakobson, 1963:ch.9; Todorov, 1970). For Greimas this distinction is parallel to a relational opposition used in philosophy : énonciation is comparable to "thinking thought" and the énoncé to "thought thought" (1976a:433). Narrative énonciation, named narration by Genette, studies the narrative producing act and the real or fictive situation within which it takes place. Within this perspective the textual, discursive manifestation is not related to the underlying story structures; both are taken together as énoncé and opposed to the agent producing the narrative, "the subject of énonciation," or, as we would usually say in criticism, the narrator. Discourse analysis for Genette constantly implies the study of relations be- tween the narrative levels. The aspects of temporality and mode enter into the rela- tions between story and discourse; and the narrative voice designates both the rela- tions between narration and discourse and between narration and story. Time, mode, and voice constitute the three major aspects of narrative discourse, based on three</page><page sequence="14">202 THERESE BUDNIAKIEWICZ properties of the linguistic verb: tense, mood, and voice. The aspect of time deals with the relation between the temporality of the story and the temporality of the discourse. The aspect of mode concerns itself with the forms and degrees of mimetic narrative representation and involves questions of distance, perspective, scene, what American criticism calls "point of view," and what it labels as "showing vs. telling." Finally , the aspect of voice designates the relations between the verbal actions and the narrator who reports them and also the narrator's relationship to the audience he is addressing. II .3.2 Greimas's semiotic analysis Maupassant. La Sémiotique du texte: exercices pratiques (1976) by Greimas is a rigorous, probing analysis of Maupassant's short story "Deux Amis." The search- ing examination into the semiotics of the literary text is construed as a "sample of practical exercises" (7) designed to test and modify the theoretical models proposed earlier by the author (Cf. 1966 a,b; 1969; 1973a) who assumes the reader to be thoroughly familiar with the general framework and the terminology informing his entire semiotic enterprise. "The practical exercises" are thus not practical exercises for the non-initiated. The phrase is used suggestively by Greimas to refer to a certain way of actively reading a text, a methodological model of doing semiotic research whose task it is to discover "operational concepts and methodological parameters" by first defining the theoretical 'problematics' of the narrative (1976b: 263). Greimas's overriding concern is setting up procedures which would enable us to account for the relations between operational levels, in particular, how to bridge the gap between the discursive unfolding of the text and its logico-semantic abstract organization. Since reading any text "as a concatenation of sentences, located on the textual surface, is impossible, absurd even, [that is, because] the discourse cannot be considered as 'readable' at that level" (228) Greimas's project may be viewed as look- ing for the discursive surface markers which signal the meaningful articulation of deep structures. In his own terms (267): The sequence of heterogeneous discursive units taken as a whole constitutes a single level of discursive seeming [paraître discursif] which is given to the reader as being there simply to signify something else. [. . .] The seeming of the discourse refers by numerous allusions to a being of a semiotic text which is implied as its internal referent. Maupassant's short story is segmented into twelve major sequences named Paris, Friendship, the Walk, the Quest, Peace, and so on. The segmentation criteria for framing any of the twelve sequences and accounting for the internal articulation of each one include the explanation of spatio-temporal criteria, proper names, logi- cal and topical disjunctions, the displacement of actors: in brief, all the major pre- suppositions which guarantee its isotopy and well-formedness. The analysis pro- ceeds in a linear and syntagmatic fashion with each sequence and seeks to locate the nodes of narrative progress marked by the passage from the virtual to the actual and</page><page sequence="15">A CONCEPTUAL SURVEY OF NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS 203 characterized by a dual semantic structure, paradigmatic and syntagmatic. The se- mantic structure invested with valorized contents that are articulated in the paradig- matic mode corresponds to axiologies. In opposition to axiologies we find ideologies which are organized in the syntagmatic mode and delimit the second semantic struc- ture. Two major mechanisms of discursivization , that is, modes of textual produc- tion, of discursive units, are brought to focus. One mode consists of the procedures of débrayage and embrayage (declutching and clutching, or: shifting-out-of and shifting-onto) of an intercalated micro-sequence which simulate a rejection of con- tents outside of the text and then reintegrate them more intimately in a coherent discourse. The second mode involves procedures of connections ofisotopies which allow the passage from one semantic isotopy to another. In addition to the relation between the discourse and the story levels, the main theoretical additions or modi- fications that interaction with the Maupassant text necessitates are: (1) an aspectual version of his semiotic square characterizing surface temporalizaron and durative processes, entering into a logic of approximations; (2) the increased importance of the cognitive dimention of the literary narrative, as opposed to the folktale (Cf. also Greimas, 1976a). Although the procedure is linear, following the sequence of the text in its unfolding, it does not concern itself with the dynamics of the reading process con- sidered as a continuous succession of 'present moments.' The "désir du texte," the hunger for the possession of textual 'qualities' and polyvalence which served as point of departure for Barthes's S/Z is checkmated by a thoroughly analytic procedure re- constructed from without. Greimas is anxious to give an overview of the greatest multiplicity of "textual facts while changing points of view and points of emphasis for each segment and for each sequence [and] multiplying the textual variations with methodological variations" (263). The investigation continually operates on the bor- der between the apprehension of the details of the text and the various narrative pro- grams, the syntagmatic paths of alternatives which suggest themselves as virtualities. Greimas retains only those which "conform to the semantic organization of the se- quence as well as to the recurrent isotopy of the text taken as a whole" (33). Just as the narrative is 'de-termined'-settled beforehand--by its closure, the end determin- ing what precedes it, so is Greimas's semiotic explanation an implicit retrospection. II .4 paradigmatics, formal structures, and meaning It is generally agreed nowadays in semiotics that any explanation or descrip- tion of meaning is nothing other than a transcoding operation. To explain what a word, sentence, or text means is to use other words, sentences, and texts in order to give a new version of 'the same thing'. Within this perspective, meaning can be defined as a paradigmatic correlation between two linguistic units or levels or two different codes. All semantic descriptions necessarily partake of this nature. Recent studies, however, show that meaning can also be conceived syntagmatically , as a process or virtual system. All the formal structures we have discussed-the syntagmatic or func- tional models, the discourse models, whether they are taxonomie, generative or nar- rative-are then viewed as forms of organization which enable meaning to be mani- fested. Two, relatively distinct, directions in research can thus be seen to emerge.</page><page sequence="16">204 THERESE BUDNIAKIEWICZ One area focuses on increasing the knowledge of formal structures and modes of or- ganization which spearhead meaning. The other area would explicate the meanings 'filling' these forms or, semiotically speaking, the contents invested as meanings in the narrative text, by means of models of articulation. The second area of research, summarily circumscribed at the outset as paradigmatic, constitutes the object of our local synopsis. It will be necessary to comment on the important notion of invest- ment before sifting out three condensed answers to questions raised by narrative and literary semantics: what does a narrative text mean and how does it mean? II.4.1 meaning as investment "Investissement" translated into English as "investment" or "cathexis" is a notion borrowed from psychoanalysis. According to the Vocabulaire de la psycha- nalyse by Laplanche and Pontalis (1967:221) investment is an "economic concept: the fact that a certain psychic energy is tied to a representation or a group of repre- sentations". The Psychiatric Dictionary by Hinsie and Campbell (1960:1 12) defines cathexis as the "concentration of psychic energy upon a given object. Jones defines it as 'charge of energy; investment (of an idea) with feeling and significance.' "Other, more commonly used meanings of 'investment' designate similar operations. In busi- ness usage investment calls to mind the placement of capital in an enterprise and in military language, the surrounding of a certain locale with military forces (i.e. to be- siege). Taking the polysemantic usage into account, the meaning of 'investing' is de- termined as: to mobilize, to place values in a circuit of exchange, of production and consumption, of supply and demand. Structural semantics (cf. Greimas) also uses this notion extensively. The preceding definition is converted into semiotic terms bor- rowed from linguistics: semes , or semantic features (=psychic values/charge) are ap- plied to signifiers (representation). From this angle, the semantic study of the narrative consists in describing how each functional, syntagmatic sequence organizes and manipulates invested con- sists that are provided with valences, i.e. values, possibilities of relations. The values in question are contents already constituted by a culture, organized by any given society and are said to form the context , "which is independent of the narrative and taken over a posteriori by the narrative model" (Greimas, 1966a:33). The context is diffuse and amorphous; it is set up by systems of values or axiologies and cultural values or ideologies of a given period. It originates from the sum of texts, discourses proper to a historical period and to a cultural zone. Some examples include moral antinomies (good/bad), applied to a type of behavior (food/marriage). It can also appear under the form of stereotyped discourses , i.e., clichés. Related concepts are those of socio-cultural verisimilitude, intertextuality (Kristeva), doxa, convention and naturalization (Culler, 1975a), extra-texte (Genot), code and especially the re- ferential code (Barthes, 1970), canonical énoncé (Greimas, 1967b), value of ex- change ("un valant -pour," Barthes, 1970:97).</page><page sequence="17">A CONCEPTUAL SURVEY OF NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS 205 II .4.2 structuration of cultural givens II .4 .2.1 meaning as "citation of the already" Meaning (le sens) for Barthes is "essentially a citation , the departure of a code ; that which allows us to go towards a code and that which implies a code, even if this code is not reconstituted or is not capable of being reconstituted" (1971c: 186). In S/Z Barthes had first discussed these codes and used them to propose a theory of reading ("To read is to find meanings," 1970:17) or more precisely, the writing of a plural reading which selects "the semantic substance" (1970:21) of several types of criticism: structural, thematic, psychoanalytic, historical. The units of mean- ing are those secondary signifieds, the connotations which can be observed 'migrating' through the text and constitute "semiologically speaking, the point of departure for a code" (1 970: 1 5). Starting with the discourse as the 'wrapping of a semantic volume, the crest line of the plural text," Barthes proposes for his analysis of "Sarrasine" to segment the discourse into so-called lexias, which are "zones of reading" (20) and to observe therein how "everything signifies ceaselessly and several times" (1 8). The observation takes the form of allocating the connotations into one or more of the five codes-named Actional, Semantic, Cultural, Hermeneutic, and Symbolic-- which in their diagrammatic totality point to the avenues of meaning, are, simply put, the meaning (126). That is, meaning is any type of intratextual (co-textual) or situational (contextual) correlation. (See Van Dijk, 1972:39,324; Enkvist, 1973:51-65.) When any narrative feature sends back to another part of the narrative or to another locus of culture which is necessary for us to read the narrative and make sense out of it, we have correlated: we have produced meaning. To correlate is then to code and to code is to quote: quote other parts of the text, other texts, other previous social and cultural codes. In sum, codes point to a context which always comes already coded, shaped, and structured by language. The meaning of the narrative is this transcoding of several pre-existing systems into its own plural system, "its infinite (circular) tran- scribability" (1 26). "The Kidnapping," says Barthes, "refers to every kidnapping ever written" (27-8). Similarly with other textual fragments that refer to "something that has always been already read, seen, done, experienced; the code is the furrow of that already " (28). All semiosis is an infinite regression of nested codes, codes branched upon other codes, ad infinitum. The code which Barthes considers the most important for the narrative is the actional one because "it covers everything in a text which strikes us as properly and immediately narrative, namely, the relation of what happens " (1 97 1 c: 1 97). It sus- tains the armature of the story and creates the illusion of continuity, of a narrative 'normalcy' which is the basic requirement of what Barthes called the readable (le lisible ), fulfilling the conditions for its readability (1970:1 12), whose law is "to fill in the chains of causality [. . .] by attaching narrated events together with a kind of logical 'paste' " (1970:187,162).</page><page sequence="18">206 THERESE BUDNIAKIEWICZ II.4.2.2 meaning as text-work: intertextuality and the Spaltung of the speaker The meaning of structuration as a diachronic transformation between the text and what is 'outside' it, as opposed to the synchronic fixity of meaning imposed by the structure of a narrative oriented by its 'telos,' was promoted especially by Kristeva in a critique of semiotics based on a system of sign-functions. In opposition to the concept of text as a communicational, representational mode of language function- ing, the text is conceived by Kristeva to be essentially a productivity, a self-generative process registered by the printed matter of the text, its pheno-text (surface, signi- fied structure) translating the geno-text (deep, signifying structure). The geno-text is not to be confused with the semantic macro -structures. It is a process of signifi- ance which subsumes the specific work done within and by language before any structured énonciation (the speech surface) and operates at a level distinct from that of the communicational sphere of language usage. The text as productivity, as work, which constitutes meaning itself, is prior to the produced meaning, to the meaning equated with the product itself (the finished product as pheno-text) and prior to the representational speech. We would like to call the productivity of the text the text- work in analogy with the Freudian concept of the dream-work with which it can easily be collated. According to Freud, the production of the dream-work which manifests itself as a hieroglyphic script, "not made with the intention of being under- stood," (1953:341) is apprehended outside of the meaning of representation. It is a game of permutations which models the production itself, the signifying in the process of producing itself. Kristeva opens here another field of study, a 'different' semiotic, on the boundary of the one we have been concerned with in this paper and which she names semanalysis (Cf. Kristeva, 1969; Ducrot &amp; Todorov, 1972:443-53). The text-work can be anchored "only as a permutation of texts, an intertex- tuality : within the space of a text several énoncés, taken from other texts, cross each other and neutralize each other" (1969:113). To study the structuration of a text as transformation is to see how it is absorbed and transformed by a multiplicity of other texts: "as a dialogue of several texts, as a textual dialogue , or as an intertextu- ality ,"(1970:68) which exhibits itself as citations and plagiarisms at the level of the pheno-text (1970:72). The particular usage and transformation of a citation, the correlation between the context and its value within a literary work, is called an ideologeme (1 969 : 1 1 5 ). Intertextuality or the textual dialogue is a notion which has its roots in a brilliant work by a Soviet semiotician, Bakhtin's Problems of Dostoevsky 's Poetics, the theory of which is summarized in chapter five, "The Word in Dostoevsky Char- acterizing Dostoevsky's novels as "the plurality of independent and unmerged voices and consciousnesses. [. . .] a genuine polyphony of full-valued voices," (1973:4) Bakhtin studies the dialogical angle at which the different speeches, texts, discourses, etc. are juxtaposed and counterposed in the work. Dialogical relations, including the relation of the speaker to his own word-conceptually reworded by semiotics as the problem of the subject of énonciation vs. the subject of the énoncé-is identical to the type of interacrtion which Kristeva calls intertextuality. The conjugation of</page><page sequence="19">A CONCEPTUAL SURVEY OF NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS 207 Bakhtin's dialogical word and the psychoanalytic principle of Spaltung (the 'Crack') delimit the problematic of the fragmentation of the T (le sujet clivé , the Spaltung of the speaker). Kristeva links the two concepts in an article on Bakhtin (1973 : 109): While making no mention of Freud (the book contains not a single reference to psychoanalysis), Bakhtin was to study the 'word', that is, discourse [. . .] as a territory in which instances of discourse confront each other, Ts' which speak. Dialogic' is the term which indicates that the discourse belongs doubly to an T and to the other, that Spaltung of the speaker which psychoanalysis was to establish with scientific caution, that topology of the speaker in relation to the 4reasure-house of meaning-signs' (Lacan) outside himself. The question of who is speaking in the psychoanalytic discourse (the Id, the Ego, or the Superego in one of Freud's systems) is no different in essence from the problems of narrative énonciation, in particular, that of locating the speaking subject in any one of the various voices of a literary text at any moment. While Barthes has focused on the 'intertextuality' of the codes at the level of the énoncé and its relation to the reading subject, i.e. the receiver, Kristeva dwells on intertextuality as it leads to the sender of the énoncé, the Spaltung of the narra- tor or the splitting of the subject of énonciation (Cf. Kristeva, 1975). II .4.3 the articulation of meaning: the semiotic square The most forceful attempt to describe the articulation of meaning as a well- regulated, deducible system underpinning the thematic formation of all semiotics has been drawn up by Greimas and Rastier (1968). A simplified summary of Greimas's semantics (1 966b) will be necessary before broaching the model for meaning. In dis- course the lexeme (the word) can assume several different functions, values, contex- tual meanings, or sememes. A set of semes y the minimal meaning units, (semantic features or markers in American semantics) located on an exclusively figurative semi- ological level, lie at the basis of sememes. The contextual semes which extend over several lexemes of a syntagm are called classemes. These are the complex units, con- figurations of semes which by their repetition or iteration account for the relatively homogeneous, semantic linearity of discourse and determine the thematic network of the text. Classemes constitute an autonomous semantic level, distinct from the semiological one, and insure the isotopy (-ies) (unity, 'meaningful whole,* global co- herence) of any text or part of a text. One of the main problems facing literary semantics consists in discovering the conditions which establish objectively the iso- topies created by or surging upon the reader. (Cf. Rastier, 1972, 1973; Coquet, 1968). When reading a text we isolate a semantic field in which a number of units (semes, sememes, classemes) fall as the topic/theme of the text and hence as a refer- ence point to collect other units around it. One principal worry here is how to struc- ture these elements since they are by nature unordered and can be chosen at random. No procedure of description is given by Greimas but he does offer a model explain- ing the formal conditions by which meaning is signaled and grasped. The most re- current label for this model is the semiotic square (le carré sémiotique) so named due</page><page sequence="20">208 THERESE BUDNIAKIEWICZ to its affinity with the logical square of oppositions. The square has also been de- scribed as "the elementary structure of signification," "the constitutional semiotic model," and the "taxonomie model," and is represented as a square of four interde- fined semes (Greimas, 1970:136): ç s ,&lt;- ^ &gt;, IX! s? 2 4 &gt; st 1 2 s st 1 where (s^ , s2) and (§2, are sets of contrary semes, and where (s1? Sj)and (s2, s2) are sets of contradictory semes. Linearly, the square has the form of a homology: (sj : s2 : : îj : 32). If Sj is the seme /life/ then s2 is /death/, s^ is /поп-life/ and$2 is /поп-death/. The double presupposition of the schémas defined by the relation of contradiction, that is, (s1? ?i) and (s2,32), is called semiosis. Given any one term of the model we can obtain all the others by two operations, taking the contradictory and taking the contrary. The meaning of a text as a whole or any semiotic text is first grasped as a correlation between the semantic axis S and its contradictory S, both axes articulating a pair of opposed terms. Meaning is diacritical, differential: antony mie relations define its articulation. These are conjunction and disjunction necessarily tied to each other since an opposition (contrary semes) can be constituted only if there is a resemblance (the semantic axis, S). The semiotic square is claimed to account for the basic representation of axiological and ideological meanings invested in a narrative and in all texts dependent on a semantic micro-universe. Greimas (1970:138) adds that it is "indeed also the model of myth proposed by Lévi-Strauss." For the semantic universe of Bernanos (1966b:ch. 12) and that of Maupassant the contents /life/ : /death/ : : /поп-life/ : /поп-death/ are predominant but they are "valorized" in different ways in each work depending on how they overlap with the elementary figurative structure /fire/ : /water/ : : /air / : /earth/ during discursivization (Cf. Greimas, 1976b: 139). Thus, /death/ for Maupassant is correlated with /earth/, that is, the Mont -Valérien, and for Bernanos with /water/. In addition to its function of articulating invested contents on a static, achronic mode the semiotic square also constitutes a taxonomie basis for generating, on the one hand, discursive forms and, on the other, dynamic, syntag- matic processes of plot events. The semiotic square is "capable of dynamic representa- tion when it is considered as the grasping of, or as the production of, meaning by the subject" (Greimas, 1970:164). Greimas further postulates that the semiotic square structuring the semantic contents has to correspond to the sequential model of plot events (1966a:31). Moreover, that the second trial (of the hero), called the main trial, (see 1966b: 197) is expected to be charged with the topical content of the text (1966a:48). The logical operations setting up the semiotic square are located on a deep logico-semantic level. They can be converted by procedures of temporalizaron on the semantic plane into "processual and aspectual representations" (1976b :25)</page><page sequence="21">A CONCEPTUAL SURVEY OF NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS 209 situated on the discursive level. The discrete, categorical terms of the square receive a 'continuous' and 'dynamic' character when interpreted by the surface 'logic of ap- proximations' (1976b:27), as represented below: í logical level /life/ &lt; * /death/ /LIVING/ J ( aspectual level /durativity/ ► /tensivity/ - ► /terminativity/ III. COMMUNICATION THEORY AND NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS Next to linguistics, logic, and psychoanalysis, communication theory has pro- vided narrative semiotics with some of its basic concepts such as those of code, in- variant, channel, message. There are three main traditions to communication theory: the mathematical, the social psychological, and the linguistic. Shannon and Weaver's The Mathematical Theory of Communication (1949) presents the general model of the communication process. It involves a source selecting a message that is encoded into signals by a transmitter; a receiver decodes the signals so that the destination can recover the original message. The linear transmission entails many problems and the mathematical answers to these problems developed new concepts: redundancy, en- tropy, noise, channels, equilibrium, and feedback. The social psychological theory is oriented to the analysis of human codes and networks. Social interaction involves some kind of behavior such as speech into which any group member can encode a message and another member can decode. Linguistic theory is primarily concerned with the analysis of speech as a form of human behavior. In this section we shall concern ourselves primarily with defining some of the communicational terms-code, invariant, message, noise-within a general theory of semiotics and linguistics and comparing the definitions with the handling of them by two practitioners of narrative semiotics. The question motivating this scanning touches upon methodological criteria of pertinence and consistency: how do the concepts of code and message fit into the whole picture of narrative theory? Ill .1 the code within a general theory of semiotics The most recent book published by Eco, A Theory of Semiotics (1976) organizes the semiotic field into two major areas, "Theory of Codes" and "Theory of Sign Production." The concept of code which is investigated in this book takes up some of the same ideas presented in the author's earlier work La Structure absente (1972). Of interest to us at the moment is Eco's definition of the term code and the phenomena it designates. Four different facts are tabulated under the name 'code': (a) a syntactic system; (b) a semantic system; (c) a set of behavioral responses on the part of the destination, that is, a set of circumstancial rules including various con- texts and circumstances which correspond to possible multiple interpretations; (d) a rule coupling some items from the syntactic system (a) with some from the (b) or (c) system. In many contexts the term 'code' covers conventionally any of the four</page><page sequence="22">2 1 0 THERESE BUDNI AKIEWICZ systems above. Eco sees this habit as confusing and one which needs to be eliminated. He suggests a partition of the codes into two types. A system of elements such as the syntactic, semantic, and behavioral rules determines an s-code (or code as system) whereas the coupling rule (d) is the only one that should properly be called a code (1972:49, 110; 1976:36-8). Taken independently, an s-code is a system or structure. The basic model of communication which foresees a code common to the sender and the receiver is too sketchy and synoptical when "langue" is considered as code. The code as "langue" is viewed, more correctly, as a complex network of subcodes which transcends categories such as 'grammar.' It is a hyper-code which clusters various subcodes some of which are strong and stable (such as denotative couplings) while others are weak and transient (such as peripheral connotative couplings). Similarly, the codes themselves cluster various systems, some strong and stable (like the pho- nological one, which lasts unchanged for centuries), others weak and transient (such as many semantic fields and axes) (1 972 : 1 1 , 1 976 : 1 25). The multiplicity of subcodes which span a culture shows that the same message can be decoded from different points of view by resorting to different systems of conventions. Ill .2 the linguistic code and the communicational model of language "Linguistics and Communication Theory" (1961) are, according to Jakobson, concerned with the same domain of verbal communication and hence close contact between them is of mutual benefit. The primary aim of information theory is analo- gous to one area of linguistics, namely, "to isolate from their particular contexts those abstract features of representation which can remain invariant under reformu- lation" (1961:245). The comparable task for narrative semiotics will be discussed below in conjunction with Greimas's proposal of what constitutes the invariant. The code as conceived by communication theory and linguistics cover the same phenom- ena. For the former, it is understood as "an agreed transformation, -usually one-to- one and reversible" (247); for the latter, the code as "langue" correlates or maps the signifier with its signified and the signified with its signifier. In other words, usage of the code involves mastering "the agreed transformation by which a set of signifiers is converted into a set of signifieds" (249). Saussurean linguistics talks about the langue which enables interlocutors to exchange a parole. A common code is their communication tool which underlies and makes possible the exchange of messages. 'Langue', however, is not a simple, monolithic code. It is an "overall code [which] includes a set of subcodes and such questions as that of the rules of transformation of the kernel code into the various [. . .] subcodes [. . .] requires both a linguistic and an engineering examination" (248). It is clear that Eco's coupling rules consti- tutional of the code per se coincide with Jakobson's rules of transformation. The kind and amount of information which "the observing subject" retrieves from language depends on his position within or outside the communicational sys- tem. In his famous article "Linguistics and Poetics" Jakobson (1960) has outlined a communicational model of language wherein the constitutive factors entering in any speech event are schematized as in Figure 1 below.</page><page sequence="23">A CONCEPTUAL SURVEY OF NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS 2 1 1 Context Referential Addresser. . . . Message. . . . Addressee Emotive Poetic Conative Contact Phatic Code Metalingual Fig. 1 Fig. 2 The addresser (or encoder) sends a message to the addressee (or decoder). To be opera- tive the message requires a code common to the sender and receiver and a context. It must also be delivered through a contact, a physical channel and psychological con- nection between the sender and the receiver. Each or these factors determines a dif- ferent function of language depending on where the stress or focus falls. All six func- tions of language are defined and given in a schema similar to the model of language, as in figure 2 above. The discussion of the poetic function which emphasizes the message it self -dra wing attention to the wording, the sound, the patterns and the syn- tax-leads to an often cited and well used semiotic 'theorem': "The poetic function projects the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection into the axis of com- bination" (1960:358). A clear explicitation of this 'theorem' and an application to a poem make up the subject matter of Riffaterre's "Le Poème comme représentation." III.3 Barthes's narrative semiotics: code, noise, and countercommunication The theoretical status of the Barthesian codes discussed in Section II .4 is ambiguous. By virtue of its construction as a loose grouping of connotations, the code is not ordered and thus unstructured. As Barthes says, "we shall not attempt to put them [the codes] into any order. Gleaning them (externally and internally) will suffice to demonstrate the plural meaning of their texture" (1970:27). Hence, in Eco's and Jakobson 's sense of the term, the Barthesian code is not a code proper, lacking the properties which characterize a system. However, many general rules and laws are suggested in Barthes's 93 critical essays which are interwoven in his hybrid combination of different types of critical discourse~a plural text of poetics reflecting the plural text of the narrative. The theoretical and methodological essays on the actional code which are an outgrowth from structural analysis mask the traces of an embryonic theory capable of being developed and systematized. Similarly, the multi- faceted discussion of the suspense or hermeneutic code provides the core for a me- thodical study of narrative suspense. The assessment on the reading activity and the readable, including the undecidability of the codes, glissando, equivocation and so forth clearly falls within the définition of Eco's s-codes, the set of behavioral re- sponses on the part of the destination. Another concept which Barthes appropriates from communication theory and one which we would like to bring out is that of noise. In its original sense, noise refers to any undesired disturbance or interference in a signaling system such as static or hissing in radio receivers, crosstalk on the telephone and 'snow' on TV. Viewing</page><page sequence="24">212 THERESE BUDNIAKIEWICZ the narrative as a kind of communication network (1970: 137-9, 150-1, 168) Barthes argues that noise is always heard from the transmitting (narrative) channel. Unlike the annoying channel noise which has to be filtered out for the receiver to recover the message, narrative noise is "a clear noise, made up of connections" (139), a rousing spectacle of multiple senders, messages, and receivers creating an interesting system of interferences desired by the reader. The information transmitted through these interferences and consumed eagerly by the reader is called a countercommuni- cation, a "cacography" (139, 151). The reception of all these communication lines turns the reader into a multiple listener, divided by his 'eavesdropping' to so many messages at once. Thus, if two colliding messages are transmitted, the reader who picks them up "must be imagined as being divided into two subjects, two cultures, two languages, two zones of listening" (151). Here in a kernel we are given the pros- pect of a theory on the Spaltung of the reader, the splitting of the subject of reading- a logical outcome when the text itself is considered as an interweaving of codes quoting a subject matter which belongs to other individual or collective 'authors.' Ill .4 Greimas's narrative semiotics: armature, code, and message Greimas's article, "Eléments pour une théorie de l'interprétation mythique" (1 966a) offers the basic theory and methodology of myth analysis. We made mention to this article several times in the course of this survey but have witheld glancing at the contents until now. The reason for this postponement lies in the only occurrence of the terms armature, code , and message in Greimas's works. These terms were first used by Lévi-Strauss in Le Cru et le cuit (1964:205; 1969:199) where he proposed them as labels for the three fundamental components of a myth. Lévi-Strauss's for- mal definitions are rather terse: "I propose to give the name armature to a combina- tion of properties that remain invariant in two or several myths; code to the pattern of functions ascribed by each myth to these properties; and message to the subject matter of an individual myth." We shall not look closer into the usage of these terms by Lévi-Strauss but turn instead to Greimas's interpretation of them. The main ob- ject of Greimas's article is to clarify these terms for a methodological interpretation of the myth. Greimas starts out with Lévi-Strauss's basic concepts and attempts to correlate them with the syntagmatic structure derived from Propp, the actantial model, and the semiotic square. He exemplifies the concepts with a Bororo myth which served as material for Lévi-Strauss's Le Cru et le cuit. Since all these models and categories were discussed throughout this paper, our aim here will simply be to gather them together and indicate which one corresponds to the armature, code, and message. The armature designates the invariant elements of the myth. It includes the Proppian syntagmatic model and the narrative grammar which extends it (Greimas, 1969). Greimas often calls this model "the narrative model/schema." The actantial structure is also part of the armature because it constitutes a second stage in the nor- malization of syntagmatic analysis. In addition to these two models which account for the sequential and anthropomorphic dimension of the narrative, the armature</page><page sequence="25">A CONCEPTUAL SURVEY OF NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS 2 1 3 contains a formal structure of contents, articulated as follows: before : after :: in- verse contents : posited contents. The inverse contents and the posited contents arti- culate two topical contents which are related by transformation. The initial and final sequence of the narrative constitute the correlated contents which are, in principle, related by the same kind of transformation as the topical contents. The code refers to what was labeled earlier as the semiotic square. The mes- sage is the meaning for the particular myth, the myth-as-token as opposed to the myth-as-type. The description of the myth "appears as a praxis which, working in conjunction with the message-occurrence, the models of the armature and the code, succeeds in simultaneously increasing both our understanding of the message and our understanding of the models inherent to it" (1966a:36). The message is decoded by the construction of isotopies which are based on the dual construction of the armature. One isotopy is the narrative isotopy which hinges upon the sequential and anthropomorphic dimension of the narrative. The second isotopy or structural iso- topy hinges upon the content structure and is strictly semantic. We see that Greimas's notion of the armature corresponds to Jakobson's general understanding of the code as the set of invariant elements and to Eco's syn- tactic s-code ; the code is Eco's semantic s-code; and the message is Eco's code proper since it operates the linkage between the models of the armature and our reading of a particular myth. In other words, the message couples or correlates a syntactic s-code, a semantic s-code and a behavioral (interpretative) s-code. It is with these remarks on theoretical transcoding that we would like to con- clude our brief survey. Because of the complexity and many-sidedness to the sub- ject, our study was exploratory and methodological in character, highlighting the most germinal and influential concepts which formed the linchpin of the field over the past decade. At the present state of explosive and multifarious research develop- ment, it is difficult, if not impossible, to fix once and for all the architecture of se- miotic discourses. The methods, knowledge, and theory have not yet evolved into an articulate and well -integrated discipline of study. One major challenge facing the near future of narrative semiotics is that of achieving some coalescence of its efforts so as to crystallize its identity as a specialization in literary poetics.
