<plain_text><page sequence="1">95 SERVICE AT ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL ON Sunday 24 July I960, Fellows of the Royal Society and guests attending the Tercentenary Celebrations were present at I0.30 at the Morning Service in St Paul's Cathedral. The congregation was approximately I5oo and 400 seats under the Dome were reserved for the President and other Officers together with Fellows, their friends and Tercentenary guests. The service was Mattins which was sung by the Minor Canons and the Cathedral Choir. A prayer for the Royal Society was included in the order of service, and the hymn before the sermon was, 'From thee all skill and science flow' (English Hymnal 525), and the Psalm was VIII 'O, Lord our Governor how excellent is thy Name in all the world'. For his sermon the Dean, the Very Reverend W. R. Matthews, took as his text the third verse of the forty-third psalm: O send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill and to thy tabernacles. and said: 'We welcome today members of the Royal Society of London and many distinguished friends and visitors who are attending the celebration of 300 years of work in the cause of science. Nowhere could they be more welcome, and no church could be more appropriate as the place where thanksgivings should be offered for the past and prayers for the future success of this world renowned learned society. For we remember with pride that Christopher Wren, the architect of this Cathedral in whose masterpiece we are assembled today, was a founder member of the Royal Society. In a lecture at Gresham College, not far from here, he suggested the formation of a select group of learned men to pursue the quest of the knowledge of nature by experiment. From that fruitful suggestion the Royal Society took its rise. And thus in I660 this famous society began. It was not quite the first of such societies, but almost the first, and beyond doubt it soon became the most important, its example begetting in course of time other similar voluntary associations for the advance of science. 'I660 was the year of the Restoration of the Monarchy in England and the return of Charles II from exile. It is only just that Charles's part in the project which Wren and his friends promoted should be remembered, for his patronage and his interest were of importance in the early years of</page><page sequence="2">96 its existence. Charles was by no means a model king or a model Christian, but he was an intelligent man and both of Wren's interests, St Paul's Cathedral and the Royal Society, owe something to him. 'The Royal Society was a product of a change in intellectual outlook. Europe, and England with it, had passed through a period when differences of religious beliefs, controversies on metaphysical dogmas, had rent nations and embittered war. The world was wearied by theological dispute. The empirical method, that of observation and experiment, of which Francis Bacon was the pioneer, seemed to promise a way of peace. Let us look at the facts with the aim of finding out what they really are and cease to deduce from general principles what they ought to be. Such was the simple plan which, as we know, has led to the amazing development of modern science. 'The original members of the Royal Society were not, however, opposed to religion. Far from that, they were Christian believers of liberal views and they were convinced that, in the end, their investigations would lend support to the belief in God and the chief Christian doctrines. Robert Boyle, for example, who has been called the Father of Chemistry, endowed a lectureship, which still exists under his name, on the evidence for Christianity. The great generalization of the Law of Gravitation was regarded by Newton and most of his contemporaries as a wonderful confirmation of the existence of a wise and benevolent Creator. 'It would be interesting to compare the expectations of the founding members of the Royal Society with what has actually happened. I suppose, to take one aspect of the matter, that they had no conception of the enormous complexity of nature as science would disclose it, nor of the possibilities of the scientific method in the framing and verification of hypotheses. They were pioneers at the entrance of a new and unknown country. They were, it might be said, on an adventure of faith, and, like Abraham, went forth not knowing whither they went. Nor did they have any premonition of the effect of the development of science on religion and theology. I think that it may be appropriate here if I venture to make some remarks on this subject which, owing to the rise of Scientific Humanism, is very much alive today. 'The relations between Science and Religion during the 300 years since 1660 have, on the whole, been both comic and tragic. A comedy of errors and a tragedy in the proper meaning of that word-a conflict of good and noble principles and persons. It would be tedious to recount the whole story of the conflict. Since this year is the centenary of the historical</page><page sequence="3">97 controversy between Bishop Wilberforce and T. H. Huxley on the Dar- winian theory of evolution, we may well take that as a kind of paradigm or salient example of the conflict at its most acute. Very few educated Christians today could sympathize with the stand taken then by the representatives of orthodox Christianity. They exhibited a stubborn resis- tance to new knowledge and a reluctance to examine evidence which we can scarcely understand. Yet these men were intelligent and honest, some of them, like Gladstone and Wilberforce himself, forward-looking and reforming in other spheres. What then was the cause of their violent reaction against the new hypotheses? They believed that they were defending a truth so precious and so fundamental that any apparent attack upon it, or weakening of its authority over men's minds, must be repelled. In my opinion, fundamentally they were right. The belief in God the Creator and His revelation held a truth that mankind cannot abandon-it is not only a truth, but a saving truth. But they were wrong, disastrously wrong, in thinking that this truth depended upon the literal accuracy of the Creation myths in Genesis. They were wrong too in thinking that the Bible was a source of scientific knowledge. And this error led them to a further error which really contradicted their own faith. They believed that God was the eternal wisdom and truth and, therefore, that all truth is in some degree a revelation of God. They ought, surely, to have conclu- ded that no truth could be unholy and all claims that new truth had been discovered ought to be candidly examined. 'Can we say that all the blame for any estrangement between science and religious faith must be assigned to the men of religion? I think not. Just as the theologians failed to recognize the limitations of their method, so scientists have often been oblivious of the limits of theirs. The error is natural enough. The triumphs of the scientific method have been so amazing and so continuous that it has been easy to imagine that this is not only a way to truth but the only way, so that any alleged truth which is not the result of scientific enquiry can be dismissed. In this connexion one might refer with respect to Scientific Humanism. No doubt there are scientific humanists who do not hold that there is no truth but scientific truth, but when we are exhorted to accept a view of existence and of the place of man in it based solely on scientific results we may ask whether the foundation will sustain the structure. For surely it cannot be accepted that there is no significant knowledge except scientific knowledge. There are things of great moment of which we are certain, but not in the sense that they can be scientifically proved. That it is better to be merciful than</page><page sequence="4">98 cruel; that it is better to be a victim of injustice than to be unjust; that truth is always to be preferred to error and illusion; all these propositions, and others of like kind seem to be more certain than, let us say, the second law of thermodynamics, and to be of more enduring value to the human race, and yet, if I were challenged to give any scientific reason for believing them, I should not know where to begin. To put this consideration shortly: science, by its method, abstracts from values and can therefore not judge them. We may use the results of science for any purpose we choose, but science cannot tell us whether our purpose is good or evil. 'Scientific Humanism has much to say to thoughtful Christians. Though I think that its full programme of eliminating every trace of the supernatural and putting human wisdom and progress in the place of God and Providence is profoundly mistaken and could, if adopted by the public as the final truth, be disastrous. We have to learn that we who believe in God cannot afford to neglect or forget the revelation of science. Though it is not the whole truth, in so far as it is true, we must accept it gladly as from God and meant for our learning. Shall we not find, when we con- sider the creation in the light of science that our conception of the Creator has been vastly too narrow? We have thought of Him too much as like ourselves, we have been too anthropomorphic in our theology and our devotions. As the inconceivable and illimitable universe is revealed and mystery after mystery unfolds, we should be, like Job when he encoun- tered God, abashed and overwhelmed. 'But we need not stay so. We ought not to. For the history of science is not only a discovery of nature; it is also a discovery of the human mind. All this structure of reasoned knowledge has been worked out, thought out and comprehended by human minds. How great a wonder and a mystery is the human mind and personality in which such powers reside! When we reflect upon it, we are inclined to agree with Aristotle, that "early father" of science, that in some sense the human reason is divine. Surely, if there is a revelation of God, we should expect to find it most evidently in human persons. 'And that is our Christian belief: God manifest in man; not in scientific man, or economic man, or literary man, or any specialized man, but in Man, and supremely manifested in One who described himself as the Son of Man, which in His language meant simply "the Man", representing all men. He lived and died for all men and, as we believe, is alive for evermore. 'Neither science nor religion has spoken its last word. It is certain that before the next centenary of the Royal Society comes round all the current</page><page sequence="5">99 text-books will long have been obsolete. Religious thought moves more slowly, but it moves, partly under the stimulus of science. I pray that the course of development in both may bring them closer together, each learning from the other, so that these two majestic forms of the spirit of man may unite in the worship and service of the God of truth.' After a short break the Choral Celebration of Holy Communion followed and was attended by a considerable number of those who had been in the congregation at Mattins.</page></plain_text>
