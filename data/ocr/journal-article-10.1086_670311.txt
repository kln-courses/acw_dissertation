      <p>The question we might ask upon encountering Alexander Regier’s <italic>Fracture and Fragmentation in British Romanticism</italic> is, do we need another book on fragments and Romanticism? D. F. Rauber wrote in 1969, “the fragment can be viewed as that form which more completely than any other embodies romantic ideals and aims.”<sup>1</sup> Regier’s assertion that “fracture and fragmentation provide a lens through which some central concerns of Romanticism can be analysed in a manner that is particularly effective in telling us something…about Romanticism” (1) seems not to have brought us much further in the last half century. However, whereas previous studies, including Marjorie Levinson’s <italic>The Romantic Fragment Poem</italic> and Thomas McFarland’s <italic>Romanticism and the Forms of Ruin</italic>, have tended to view the fragment as a form or a genre, Regier focuses on fragmentation as a “process…
defined by a series of changes” (7).<sup>2</sup> Furthermore, Regier’s purview extends beyond the historical boundaries of the Romantic period; as he writes, “Romanticism is central to us, and fragmentation is central to Romanticism” (3). In a study that addresses the work of canonically Romantic authors William Wordsworth, John Keats, and Thomas de Quincey, as well as Edmund Burke and Immanuel Kant, Regier also looks at how Romantic fragmentation “shape[s] our current way of thinking, especially about aesthetics” (2) by reading these texts alongside and through the work of more recent thinkers, especially Walter Benjamin and Paul de Man.</p>
      <p>In chapter 1, Regier follows Benjamin’s “On Language as Such and on the Language of Man” (1916) in examining the fragmentation of language through the story of the Tower of Babel. Using Benjamin’s proposition that nature’s muteness is a condition of lamentation, Regier reads moments of silence in Wordsworth’s <italic>The Ruined Cottage</italic> (1798), <italic>The Prelude</italic> (1805), and <italic>Essay upon Epitaphs</italic> (1810–12) as instantiations of the fall from a language of plenitude that not only unites humans with each other but also unites them with nature. However, here and elsewhere in the book, the arguments are overburdened with ponderous explication: Regier writes of the “senseless rocks” in the <italic>Ruined Cottage</italic>, “we think of rocks as ‘senseless’ in two ways. On the one hand, they illustrate that some constituents of nature (especially inorganic ones) are fundamentally lacking in complexity of feeling: they do not have senses. Secondly, and as a result, they cannot express their feelings; they are senseless: they cannot use their senses, cannot see, touch, feel, or speak” (33). At other moments, the readings are strained, as when, writing about the Arab dream in <italic>The Prelude</italic>, Regier declares, “it is through nature, even if through nature in a dream, that the Babelian condition is overcome” (43). The greatest problem with this chapter can be summarized in Regier’s absolute partitioning of the “epitaphic lyric” from the “musical memory” in his reading of Wordsworth’s “The Solitary Reaper” (1805) when he writes, “for the poet, this [silent music] can be no solution; after all, his is a linguistic medium” (48). The suggestion that the unheard music of the reaper is merely absent for the poet seems to oversimplify the project of the <italic>Lyrical Ballads</italic> and Wordsworth’s poetry in general, making Wordsworth’s relationship to the Babelian metaphor Regier promulgates somewhat tenuous.</p>
      <p>Regier’s uncomplicated acquiescence to the assertion that nature’s mournful state arises from her equally impotent silence might be dismissed as nostalgic prosopopoeia; thus, it seems fitting that Regier turns to the issue of anthropomorphism in his second chapter, which traces the eighteenth-century discourse on anthropomorphism and the origins of language to present anthropomorphism as the “master-trope” that “encapsulates the problem of figurative language and origins” (57). Focusing again on the fundamental division between humans and nature, Regier presents Lord Kames and Blair’s arguments that the general absence of gendered articles in the English language makes for a more “philosophical” language that is at the same time particularly emphatic in its figures—and therefore emphatically fictive. Regier develops the reading of Babel from the previous chapter by showing how the use of anthropomorphism reveals the linguistically motivated distance between the natural and the human: “the longing rhetorics of anthropomorphism constantly remind us that both language and subject are fractured in their origin” (74).</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most poignant and locally relevant in view of recent natural disasters is Regier’s chapter on the 1755 earthquake in Lisbon and its relationship to the discourse of the sublime. Regier points out that thinkers throughout western Europe have been captivated by the earthquake: writers including Goethe, William Blake, Mary Wollstonecraft, Heinrich von Kleist, Thomas Mann, Adorno, Benjamin, and Bertrand Russell have used it to illustrate both a world characterized by “inexplicable suffering” and one simply subject to “natural causes” (76). Regier shows how the destabilizing impact of the Lisbon earthquake contributes to Kant’s and Burke’s familiar accounts of the sublime, claiming that the sublime is a “taming and domesticating force that ultimately relies on the destructive power of fragmentation” (77).</p>
      <p>The most fascinating section of the book, in my opinion, is Regier’s chapter on lunulae, or round brackets, in <italic>The Prelude</italic>. Arguing that “fracture weaves itself into Wordsworth’s texts syntactically via parenthesis, a punctuation mark and a rhetorical figure” (95), Regier reads literal moments of parenthesis in <italic>The Prelude</italic>, such as<disp-quote>
            <verse-group>
               <verse-line>Well I call to mind,</verse-line>
               <verse-line>(‘Twas at an early age, ere I had seen</verse-line>
               <verse-line>Nine summers) when upon the mountain slope</verse-line>
               <verse-line>The frost, and breath of frosty wind had snapp’d</verse-line>
               <verse-line>The last autumnal crocus …</verse-line>
            </verse-group>
         </disp-quote>
         <sup>3</sup>as “insist[ing] on the multi-faceted nature of the auto-construction” by visually, grammatically, and rhetorically creating a break in the “temporal cohesion of the account” (99). From there, Regier extends his argument to moments of parenthesis in Wordsworth’s representations of the sublime, focusing particularly on the “blue chasm, a fracture in the vapour” (XIII.56) within the “sea of mist” that the speaker encounters upon climbing Mount Snowdon. Regier concludes that “the language and imagery of such passages insist on a double-sided nature: they are both destructive, uncontrollable moments of rupture and at the same time structuring and rationalizing events which help to aestheticise and narrativise experience” (117), although, in this case and others, we might wonder whether parenthesis is indeed the cause of the fractures that pervade <italic>The Prelude</italic> or merely a symptom of them.</p>
      <p>In the fifth chapter, Regier reads Keats’s letters as “literary constructs” (120) and connects the exchange of letters to displacement and to gift theory. While Regier’s conclusion that “fragmentation becomes the lens through which we focus and construct the body of Keats” (137) does not seem revolutionary, his claim that “the letter in Keats’s work becomes a fragmentary principle around which his posthumous corpus is constructed” (119) seems overstated, just as his framing attempt to claim critical indifference to or subordination of Keats’s letters to the poetry is overdone by his own admission that the poems are frequently transcribed in, and therefore inseparable from, the letters.</p>
      <p>In the sixth chapter, Regier uses Thomas de Quincey’s work as an archivist of Wordsworth to discuss the rupturing power of citation, which fragments both the source text and its target. Citation, Regier shows, is unavoidable, although it varies in degree from influence to plagiarism and mirrors the fragmentation inherent in language, replicated even in the text before us: “citation is an inevitable part of any writing of criticism that proceeds via sources or examples” (150). Discussing de Quincey’s interventions in Wordsworth’s poetry, including a return to the example of the Arab dream in book V of <italic>The Prelude</italic>, Regier argues that “citation, and hence fracture, is a necessary moment in the survival of poetry” (164).</p>
      <p>Regier closes by turning to Paul de Man’s “‘Conclusions’ on Walter Benjamin’s ‘The Task of the Translator’” (1983), in which de Man addresses once more the issue of the fracture between the human subject and language. This is an issue that not only concerns Romantic texts but, Regier suggests, troubles our critical relationship with them. Regier finishes his book with several prescriptions for the future of Romantic studies: that we “recognis[e] the contemporary nature of Romanticism, and the Romantic nature of the present,” that we “develop a sense for the importance of historical specificity, as well as its relation to analytical statements,” and that we take care “not to overestimate our results” (186).</p>
      <p>
         <italic>Fracture and Fragmentation</italic> demonstrates the weakness of such critical restraint with analysis that is frequently laborious in its exposure of the banal. However, ranging over myth, rhetorical gestures, natural disasters, and critical strategies, Regier’s study is structurally imaginative and provides a useful illustration of fragmentation’s many forms in the ongoing Romantic moment. This synthetic perspective on the fragment is the book’s strength, and Regier’s contribution to the existing body of work on fragments and Romanticism is to broaden the boundaries of these categories.</p>
