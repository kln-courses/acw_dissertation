<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews HERTA PAULY Why We Don't Write about the Dance A REVJ.W ARTICLE* When objects of any kind are first presented to the eye or imagination, the sentiment which at- tends them is obscure and confused; and the mind is, in a great measure, incapable of pro- nouncing their merits or defects. The taste cannot perceive the several excellencies of the performance, much less distinguish the particu- lar character of each excellency, and ascertain its quality and degree. "On the Standard of Taste," David Hume Aestheticians seldom have grown aware of aes- thetic values and principles through the dance, and few even today are in the habit of demon- strating principles with examples from the dance. If it is for lack of acquaintance with this art, how is it to be explained? There are historical reasons, and historical reasons have a way of perpetuating themselves. While the entire history of both the arts and aesthetics in the West may account for the minor role the dance has played in them, this analysis is limited to the more immediate causes. The reader is reminded however that from antiquity through the Middle Ages and into Renaissance times philosophy of art and of the beautiful, insofar as it concerned itself with particular arts, favored poetry and painting, with music running third and sometimes piggy- back.1 Modern aesthetics was born of a curious paradox. During the eighteenth century em- pirical methods were also applied gradually to matters aesthetic. This should have led sooner * The Modern Dance: Seven Statements of Belief, edited and with an introduction by Selma Jeanne Cohen.

But the beginning of modern aesthetics also coincided with the singling out of a distinct class of things and ac- tivities named the fine arts.2 The new system of the fine arts, which included the dance, nar- rowed the traditional concept of art,3 but at the same time emphasized the oneness of these fine arts as grounded in one or a few quite general principles that presumably constituted their common essence.' The empirical expecta- tion of the uniqueness of each art thus was greatly modified by the expectation of their oneness. Hence, if their essential nature was the same, they differed only in their means-ma- terials, instruments of production, and in the sense organs through which they were perceived. Upon this premise, even empirical-minded aes- theticians could feel justified in studying the one art they knew best or thought superior to the others and make only short references to the other arts as being parallel cases. The move- ment, underway at the same time, toward a systematic separation of the arts5 did not redeem the dance from being a short-reference art. Al- though it had gained membership in the fine arts in-group, as far as aestheticians were con- cerned, it remained a minor member, if not a member in name only. Was the dance deficient in any features asso- ciated with the concept of fine arts, even though it had the credentials that had gained it admission? Its major art form up to the first decades of the twentieth century had been the ballet. Audiences adored their ballerinas and ballet movement was admired for its beauty; still, the formal niveau of ballet was low as measured by the standards of artistic form that</page><page sequence="2">464 from the nineteenth century on were demanded of the fine arts. Its formal range and quality was not varied enough. The pantomimic plots of the dramatic ballets were fairy-taleish and where more ambitious subjects were tackled (e.g., in Greek tragedies), the movement style of ballet did not possess sufficient depth for handling plots and emotions of magnitude. Hence, it did not fulfill the demands of great and serious art associated with the concept of the fine arts. Moreover, because it adhered to an estab- lished repertory of movements and positions, purely linear and abstract, which it employed for all subjects, the ballet became an art of convention. Subjects were conventionalized in terms of the pre-existing movement-vocabulary, and their diversity and individuality were ob- literated by this uniformity and primacy of the style. In this, ballet differed in principle from the other fine arts which from the latter part of the eighteenth century on were oriented toward invention, originality, and specific form-repre- sentational or abstract. While every art in every period tends to bring about some conventions, and while these form at least the husk of period styles, in the modern era they have to remain in flux or are very soon branded as cliches. As an art of convention and as a relatively arrested style, ballet became atypical of the fine arts as the modern West conceived of them. This made it unsuitable material for aestheticians in search of general principles of the fine arts. It had be- come a class of things of which it was itself the only member. Ballet has since been modified. Today there are instances where ballet has almost merged with modern dance, but it is largely through the latter that the categorical difference which put the dance in a class by itself has been over- come. Still, the public relations of modern dance are not as good as they might be. While every coed these days is exposed to it as an activity, the modern dance, as seen on stage, does not speak for itself as plainly as does the more popular ballet. Which may be no tragedy; let there be some light for the few. One way of bridging the gulf is to let dancers speak for themselves. The book reviewed in the following pages does an excellent job of just that. What is more, it may mediate between the dance and aestheticians who so far have shied away from this art. In The Modern Dance: Seven Statements of Belief, editor Selma Jeanne Cohen "turned on" seven prominent choreographers to write on what their art means to them. Each was (1) to RE V I E W S set forth his or her ideas on the modern dance and then (2) to describe what he would do if commissioned to compose a dance that had to deal with the theme of the Prodigal Son. Fur- thermore, in her Introduction, Miss Cohen states that the modern dance "once was a fairly homogeneous entity." At least "its exponents .. shared many principles of belief. Today... the ranks are not only diversified but divided within themselves." In part she leaves it for the reader to decide whether "the various manifes- tations can still be brought together under a single name" (i.e., the modern dance). With the help of these pre-established foci, the essays actually amount to a documentary on the mod- ern dance at mid-century as seen by its practi- tioners. When artists write about art, their own art in particular, the critic is prepared for one of two irritants: that they profess to be guided by some currently prestigious principles whose manifes- tation the critic looks for in vain in their works; or that they claim to work at all times with the innocence of pure inspiration, unaware of any principles, including such as they manifestly share with other artists. Neither can be said of these dancers. In fact, an initial common char- acteristic of modern dancers is that, having had to be apologists for their art from the beginning and, in keeping with their art, having had to be imaginative teachers, the rigors of their profes- sion have added honest eloquence to their pri- mary talent. The levels of discourse in this book range from verbalized dancing through art crit- icism and philosophy to the fine art of self- criticism. Miss Cohen, in her concise and spar- kling Introduction recalls the various phases through which the modern dance has passed and, with a slight turn of the pen, previews the issues at hand. "The modern dance," she con- cludes, "is an art of iconoclasts." To start with, there is enough concurrence among the participant choreographers on what the important issues are, on the problems in- herent in their art, and on criteria of good form in dance-movement to justify a review under a few general headings. In regard to au- thentic style in a wider sense, however, a major difference will be noted. While articulated with reference to the dance, it calls attention to an important antinomy in contemporary art in general. Whether the modern dance ever was homogeneous depends in part on which species are judged as belonging to the genus, e.g., only the American dance? But we shall attend to principles, not to membership, since principles are what the book is chiefly about. More than any particular style or technique,</page><page sequence="3">Reviews modern dance is "a point of view... an indi- vidual quest for an individual expression of life" (Anna Sokolow); "a state of mind.. to come to terms with our time" (Jose Limon). Donald McKayle believes that the contemporary outlook is not an exclusive of the modern or any particular type of dance, and that to dis- tinguish it categorically from the ballet is not true to fact. But most of the writers insist on that difference and are ready to define it. Notably Erick Hawkins. Modern dance has re- stored to the dance what ballet had expelled: the sensuous attitude toward the body, the or- ganic flow of movement, starting in the body's center, "not like a man's mind-contrived inor- ganic machine, which essentially cannot move but only take positions." Unlike ballet, it "does not rest on a diagrammatic theory." Modern dance movement is "basic, essential, organic," as opposed to "peripheral, not activated by inner necessity" (Pauline Koner). Using the whole, undistorted foot, or dancing sur les pointes in stiff ballet slippers is not a minor stylistic detail in which modern dance and ballet differ; it epitomizes worlds of difference (Hawkins). Pure movement is a concept cited repeatedly. It is variously defined as "true form... which comes from reducing reality to its essential shape, as Cezanne did with the apple" (Soko- low). "Pure movement... has its own validity (apart from specific characterization) when its practitioners are able to make their audience respond with the very fibre of their own mus- culature" (McKayle). The essence of all dancing is movement quality. It must be distinguished from merely decorative movement which lacks the inner quality that makes movement signifi- cant without or before "saying anything" (Hawkins). A modern dancer gives in to the body, feels how it wants to move, respects its own animate logic. Three principles seem to converge here: the reversal from ballet with its standard move- ments, the quasi-romanticist confidence in the spirit and wisdom of nature, and the taste for bringing out rather than concealing the mate- rials used in a work of art. First applied to architecture, sculpture, and interior design, this principle, of course, is especially appropriate in the dance where the artist's own body is at once the material and the instrument. Alwin Nikolais is an avowed non-purist, but the term refers to his taste for fusing the dance with other theatrical effects into one "magical panorama of things, sounds, colors, shapes, lights, illusions, and events happening before your eyes and ears." Considering that the mod- 465 ern dance started out with the goal, fervently pursued, of becoming self-sufficient, this sounds like a reverse development. However, in the dance theater as Alwin Nikolais conceives (and produces) it, the dance is not subservient to any one master art. All arts are reduced to tributary effects of an overall theatrical composition. The apparent reversal thus could be taken as a dialectical development toward synthesis of the arts, a more radical Gesamtkunstwerk than Rich- ard Wagner's, in that each of the arts is re- duced to the level of parts. Typical in this connection is that Alwin Nikolais does not, as do the others, make a point of "organic move- ment." The concept of "pure movement" may be applicable here after all as denoting a re- duction of movement in this sense and see below. Individuality of expression is considered es- sential to the modern dance as a creative art. This requires, for one thing, that style be kept open; "no rules, 'Academy,' or adherence to tradition" (Sokolow; similarly, Koner, McKayle, Limon). To unify the modern dance, Erick Hawkins points out, "would be to deny the reason for its having come into existence." Lack of individual expression, e.g., through vague choreography, reveals that the choreographer "doesn't know who he is, or how he feels" (Sokolow). Creative openness effects the manner of composing. "I never plan a dance" (Sokolow). "Start with too rigid an idea, stick to it, and there is a good chance the dance will become forced and lifeless" (Paul Taylor). Taylor might "start with a wishy-washily formed idea, give it up if a better one appeared, perhaps break out of a previous style." Sometimes the significance of a new dance emerges in the process of work- ing it out. "Yes, I see what I am trying to do" (Sokolow). Non-intentionality, it appears, is considered authentic partly as resulting from pure movement, but mainly because of the un- conscious origin of creative imagination. Anna Sokolow adds that her own works "never have real endings." Choreographers must make creative use of their dancers' individuality. "Dancers have in- dividual traits, and just when you think you know how to handle them, they change.... Sometimes their limitations are as interesting as their strong points" (Taylor). Pauline Koner, however, observes that many choreographers today ask their dancers to be "just bodies for the design in space," while dancers are pre- occupied with technique and external design, but lacking in artistic depth. "The face is plain because it is probably counting like mad." Anna Sokolow deplores that "this generation copies</page><page sequence="4">466 their teachers," and ascribes this to a scarcity of creative individuals. Do these deviations from individual creativ- ity-note that the two types mentioned com- plement each other-only reiterate the fact that individuality is a gift of the few so that others inevitably become their instruments,6 or that the ratio between creators and imitators today is that of a few to very many? Or do they in- dicate that individual expression is in process of being abandoned as a principle of style? The modern dance "no longer is representa- tional but imaginative" (Sokolow). To be sure, representation, and narrative style, can be para- sites on pure movement and can break up the condensed form of a good dance composition. But since representation can be imaginative, what kind of imagery is considered proper for the contemporary dance? Alwin Nikolais ex- plains that "artistic freedom" no longer needs "the subject vehicle." "While the early modern dance explored the psyche, its concepts involv- ing man's concern with the joys and pains of self-discovery ... the greatest gifts to man are his ability to think in terms of abstraction and his ability of transcendence. From these he de- rives his imaginative powers. [The new freedom is] freedom from the domination of the con- crete." 7 Here indeed a profound change is indicated. Although at the time that the modern dance made its appearance all the arts were already turning away from representation, the dance too must now make the transition from an anthropomorphic art to one using images not taken from human life in a direct sense. Nikolais thus confirms as an aesthetic necessity of the dance what Jose Ortega Y Gasset in a famous essay declared to be at once the essential characterstic of modern art and of aesthetically "pure" art as such.8 For reasons evident in the above quotation Nikolais rejects the term de- humanization in favor of abstraction. In this book at least, Nikolais represents a minority. While the others also affirm abstrac- tion and despise emotionalism, there are strong convictions that life is the source of art, that the emotional component is essential to the creative process and to the audience response and that "the artist's function is perpetually to be the voice of conscience of his time" (Limon). Jose Limon professes discipleship to Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, and Doris Humphrey and "their vision of the dance as an art capable of the sublimity of tragedy and the Dionysian ecstasies." Communication occupies each of the writers. It is, first of all, a timely subject, and it is REV IEW S danceworthy ("Loneliness and non-communica- tion," Sokolow). Moreover, behind the dance there is the dancer. An artist should be a re- markable person. "Few young dancers today leave one with the feeling 'This is the person I cannot forget; I don't... remember what he did. But I cannot forget... the presence' " (Koner). In overflowing the banks of the social sci- ences, communication has flooded the market- place and has become a faddy concept. But in the contemporary arts with their cryptic imagery and abstraction (in the dance, add pure move- ment) it is a built-in problem. Nikolais does not think so. "An art is not a separate entity grafted upon people" but "arises from the qualities that characterize the society from which it stems." Like painters and sculptors, the choreographers feel that the taste and comprehension of the general public suffer from a lingering simple- enumeration empiricism that makes it look for description and narrative, while rationalism makes its approach to art conceptual and literal. The communication gap thus is blamed on the audience. Why then do very in-audiences some- times complain that if there was a "message" it didn't come across, and if none was intended, why the tantalizing subject, the enigmatic title? Erick Hawkins proposes that not the dance but false expectations of the audience create the problem. He argues that there are two distinct kinds of movement. There is "pure form"; it simply "is," before and beyond communication. Another type is "movement for the sake of re- vealing some theme, idea, or narrative." This type is used as a language and it must communi- cate. This argument will not settle the matter, resting as it does on a dubious assumption. Actual movements do not conform to these categorical distinctions. Dance movements usu- ally are not of one or the other type, but in be- tween. Hawkins implicitly acknowledges this when he points out that language movement, in order to be dance movement, also must be based on, at least cannot surrender, the quality of pure movement. However, as a consequence of this fusion, pure movement inevitably modi- fies that which is said. Communication takes place not only in signification, nor only in terms of when, and what, the dancer "sets out" to signify. In as much as a dancer elicits an audience response through every kind of move- ment, he communicates, and intends to. The real issue here is that of the distinction between the aesthetic in the narrow sense, i.e., formal values as such, and art, or great art, which usu- ally embodies or suggests, and hence conveys</page><page sequence="5">Reviews or communicates meaning: perspectives of real- ity beyond that which is materially-formally presented. In instances of the latter kind, art can be said to become a language. Since in good works of art this language is inherent in the aesthetic form, the condition of ill fame, i.e., x expresses y-chief target of the autonomists, does not exist. However, since the language of perceptual form is not conceptual and designa- tory, indeterminacy as to meaning often prevails indeed. Hawkins' either-or conclusion implies that he thinks of this issue as a pseudo-problem. It is not. In non-representational styles especially, art- ists have to retain some control over what is communicated in order to prevent a mere Rorschach response. They achieve this through sensitive choice of evocative symbols. But even if it is agreed that sensible forms, good art forms in particular, have trans-formal, semantic purport, the other question remains: what is that purport in any given form? Since the viewer, as well as the viewer's critic, may be projecting into it contents of his own mind, no one-the Cartesian God being dead-can determine absolutely whether or not the viewer, and the artist himself, for that matter, is not projecting. The radicality of the issue will worry only epistemologists. For artists it will have lost its sting if a degree of constancy of purport in certain forms can be ascertained. Pauline Koner speaks to this issue. She is "seeking a language that.., speaks the quintessence of a mood or feeling in terms that are universally recogniz- able." She feels that "there are certain root manifestations that are indigenous to particular emotions, and all intrinsic artists draw upon them." Pauline Koner discovered in the graphic works of Kaethe Kollwitz "a tremendous sense of pathos and compassion.., conveyed in the feeling of the body line.. . . The drawings themselves .y.... I found that the line of the back and the head that she had in all her draw- ings is exactly what I use in Solitary Song.... It is through these elementary symbols that an ex- perience is shared by artist and audience." After this survey of their beliefs and professed manner of working, it will not be surprising that these choreographers apparently did not find the Prodigal Son too intriguing a theme. They thought it too narrative and burdened with characters. ("George Balanchine once re- marked on the impossibility of showing who is the mother-in-law in a dance," quotes Paul Taylor.) None would do the story straight, in narrative style and with a Biblical setting. They would reduce the story to its core motif. For Jose Limon it is the father-son conflict. Since it 467 is inherently insolvable, he would present it as the clean-cut tragedy which in the Bible is glossed over by the happy end. Brick Hawkins, on the contrary, would bring out the motif of "return and up-coming, a rebirth, the courage of the hero to grow up" and "come to self- knowledge." He would draw into dclearer focus than does the Biblical story the relationship be- tween the father and the elder son who had stayed home. The father would have to show his love also for him, to give more human mo- tivation to the elder son's return from jealousy to sharing in the gladness over the Prodigal's return. Though intrigued by the story, Hawkins could not tell in advance how he would present it in movement. That would have to "come out of my body." He would compose the dance first and commission the musical score afterwards, to fit the movements. Anna Sokolow has always been interested in the Bible and in finding a movement style that has a Biblical feeling. She would try to capture the quality of the story, might do it in modern dress, perhaps use jazz music with the quality of ancient instruments. Of the seven commentators, Alwin Nikolais is the most averse to the project. One would have to reach past all the literal, philosophical, psy- chological, and sentimental elements to the "molecular substance" of the story. He does not specify what it is; instead he sketches (hilari- ously) several ways in which someone surely would handle the theme, but should not; among them is one version that readers familiar with Nikolais' dances will have to use all their will power not to take as an auto-satire. I think all the male writers declared themselves to be prodigal sons, and proud of it. In order to decide whether the variety of its manifestations still justifies the single name "modern dance"-the question Miss Cohen thought the book might answer-we find it necessary to distinguish three ways in which "modern" could be predicated of the dance: as a (a) period, (b) genetic, (c) generic term. (a) Modern is an unfortunate term for a pe- riod style since modernity has no concrete and constant properties: every style is modern when and if it is contemporary. The term was used in this sense to distinguish the new dance from the ballet.9 Since the modern dance manifestly has undergone changes, both consummate and in the individual styles of the dancers, it is not a period style representing the early phase of its existence. (b) Despite changes, does it still adhere to the original principles? The antinomy we saw taking shape between the statements of Alwin</page><page sequence="6">468 Nikolais and some of the others might serve as the focal issue here. Does it indicate abandon- ment of original principles on the part of Nikolais, or arrested development on the part of the others? Theoretically, it indicates neither. The original principles were several, and both the anthropomorphic (and humanistic) and the non-anthropomorphic orientation can be de- rived from them: one continuing in the em- phasis on organic movement and on comment- ing on the human scene through the individual prism; the other carrying further the develop- ment toward abstraction and more indirect commentary on the actual world. Furthermore, as in the more streamlined costumes used today that enhance pure movement and reduce decors to essentials, the modern dance now realizes its original principles more fully than it did at first; it has developed its potentials. (c) If modern is understood as a generic term, denoting contemporaneousness at all times, the modern dance would have ceased being modern if it had not changed.10 Not all that is being shown today qualifies as good art; there are sensationalist and faddy versions. But to have poor relations is a fringe deficit not peculiar to the dance; it besets every art. The modern dance is modern in the generic sense mainly because its constitutive features are, or closely correspond to, those of the other modern arts. Having earned for the dance full membership among the modern arts is its enduring achieve- ment. The modern dance is the youngest among the contemporary arts, and, rejecting the ballet, it had to choose its own parents (who did not live together);1 but it was mostly on its own from an early age. More than any dance tradi- tion, the significant adults were the other con- temporary arts. As this review has shown, dancers today subscribe to the same aesthetic principles and debate the same issues, often without the shorthand of technical terms, that are or have been key topics in the other arts, art criticism, and philosophy. For example, imi- tation and realism are out (after having had a comeback in the 30's, motivated by the urge to be socially significant). They avoid ideational themes that are not inherently danceable, as musicians may shun program music and poets avoid conceptual language. They reject narra- tive style as unsuitable for their "compact" art, as do modern painters, in favor of built-in sym- bolism and significant form. They disdain empty or stereotyped conceptions of beauty and grace- fulness. They debate the relative values of "absolute" dance and fusion with other arts, of anthropomorphic and dehumanized style. They REVIEWS know from experience that rigid intentionality can be a tour de force, spoiling a composition. Some are conversant in existentialism. Some ponder phenomenology of form as they work for clear expression. Not mentioned in the Seven Statements, but added by Miss Cohen, "they take their ideas.. .from chance juxtapo- sition from serial music and action painting, from the current concepts of 'happenings' and the theatre of the absurd." ' It appears, then, that the modern dance is as rich a source for aesthetic inquiry (art criticism and philosophy) as are the other arts. In fact, regarding formal values, it is an especially pure exemplar. It is the only time and space art that employs both dimensions entirely aesthetically. (Drama employs time aesthetically in the inter- acting of characters and to the extent that the length, i.e., duration, of a play is a qualitative factor. Aside from this, drama is only extended in time, quantitatively and incidentally.) Not using language, the dance relies entirely on imaginative form. In the performance of both music and dance, both of which employ time aesthetically, the artist is seen at work; but musicians-as-seen are mostly technicians. In the dance, there being no separate instrument, per- former, performance, and instrument are en- tirely fused in the aesthetic whole. That aestheticians do not consult the dance more is still largely due to lack of close ac- quaintance with it except as mere spectators. Writing on the dance, moreover, is more diffi- cult than writing on any other art. Literature, itself verbal, is more hospitable to verbal analy- sis than is the dance. The graphic and plastic arts are more easily analyzed than music and the dance, simply because they hold still. Music at least can be played over. Since, in music, composition and performance can be separated, and there are good recording devices, if not the performance, at least the composition re- mains the same. But the dance! Who can see dances often enough really to see them in depth,13 except dancers themselves and the few critics who make it their profession to follow them around with eyes and pen? Besides, there are those who can see but not write, and those who can write but do not see enough. Last, does the modern dance only manifest the same aesthetic values and principles as do other arts, differing from them only in the means? Without wishing to be dogmatically modern, one would have to revise the question first. The "means" are the art; hence they are no mere means. Does the modern dance, then, manifest aesthetic values not found in the other arts? An extensive answer would amount to</page><page sequence="7">Reviews having the party to which this paper is meant only as an invitation. But Erick Hawkins knows how to put it in a nut shell:14 "The modern dance has had two goals. One was to develop a larger and more comprehensive total tech- nique with which to train the body so that it could fulfill the wisdom of a new beauty of human movement in the Western world. The other was to use this completely trained instru- ment to convey a more far-ranging subject matter in the art." 1On words, poetic and liturgical. That poetry and painting received the widest attention would require essay-length documentation, but is not needed here. In short: cf. Plato's many writings on poetry, and commentaries on painting, both lauda- tory and critical; Aristotle's Poetics, Horace's Art of Poetry, Longinus' On the Sublime, Plotinus' En- neads steered interest of Renaissance and early Modern writers again in that direction. Aside from the Horatian alleged affinity of poetry and painting, the latter art seems to have derived its prominence from the contention widely held in antiquity and Middle Ages that it delighted and nurtured the most favored sense. Seeing, moreover, was thought to be the sense most congenial to the "light of rea- son," the mystical "vision," and "divine illumina- tion." 2 For the gradual emergence of the system of fine arts, P. O. Kristeller, "The Modern System of the Arts," Renaissance Thought II, Essay ?IX (Harper Torchbooks, 1965). *Distinguishing it from the sciences, crafts, ap- plied arts, and liberal arts. ' Aristotelian logic and Cartesian reductionism combined in this method of demonstration. Most representative of this method is a treatise by the Abbe Charles Batteux, member of the Academie Francaise and of that of the Inscriptions and Belles Lettres, entitled "Les Beaux Arts, Reduits a un meme Principle" (1746). According to Paul O. Kris- teller, Batteux was the first to conceive clearly of the system of the fine arts as a distinct class. Renais- sance Thought II, esp. sec. VI. According to Batteux, the definitive principle not only of poetry and painting but of music, the dance, and sculpture is "l'imitation de la belle Nature." But he delights in discovering many sub-unities as well. The dance is one branch of the arts that are grasped through the eyes (pp. 37-38); it is one with music in that both are more "natural" than the verbal arts while "La parole est un language d'institution" (p. 275). The principal object of music and dance should be the imitation of the passions, whereas that of poetry is mainly the imitation of actions (p. 277). Though devoting special sections to each of the arts, he treats music and dance together since they once were one, and should be reunited.

The tendency to purify art would "ef- fect a progressive elimination of the human, all too human, elements predominant in romantic and naturalistic production... a point can be reached in which the human content has grown so thin that it is negligible... The artist is brazenly set on deforming reality, shattering its human aspect, de- humanizing it... By divesting [objects] of 'lived' reality the artist...leaves us locked up in an ab- struse universe, surrounded by objects with which human dealings are inconceivable... This new way of life which presupposes the annulment of spon- taneous life is precisely what we call understanding and enjoyment of art. Not that this life lacks senti- ments and passions, but those sentiments and pas- sions evidently belong to a flora other than that which covers the hills and dales of primary and human life. What those ultra-objects evoke in our inner artist are secondary passions, specifically aes- thetic sentiments." 9 I.e., the "classical" dance. Classical, of course, is used also as a generic term. Ballet dancers today, except those who are avowedly traditional, favor the latter usage as it connotes timeless validity. 10 In substance, this is Miss Cohen's answer to her question. She puts it in conditional form, and her condition is very specific: if the choreographer "is always concerned with the unacceptable symbol, the one that startles us into awareness".... If "the pressure" is there. She adds that some ballet crea- tions fulfill this condition.

The use of drums, gongs, and simple woodwinds for accompaniment, because of their close affinity with body movement, also is of Oriental heritage. In Germany, Ausdrucksgymnastik (expressive gymnas- tics) formed the link between athletics and modern dance. 12 The Modern Dance, p. 11. 13 In the future, improved filming techniques, large scale production of dance films and their availability for individual study, approximately like that of music records, doubtless will compensate for the difficulty. 14 The Modern Dance, p. 43. PECKHAM, MORSE. Man's Rage for Chaos. Biol- ogy, Behavior, and the Arts. Philadelphia, Chilton Company, 1965, pp. xv +- 339, $6.95. In his Paris Diary Ned Rorem writes, "Com- position is notation of what composers think they've heard before. Masterpieces are marvel- ous misquotations." This is close to Peckham's theory: the artist is a master of discontinuities. He deliberately upsets order. Peckham believes that there is sufficient psychological knowledge to sustain his theory. Surely artists have always thought that they were changing what their predecessors had done, whether for the differ- ence only or for the better. Some evaluation of the change was made. Only in his last chapter does one find how trivial value statements about works of art are to Peckham, who, having appealed to psychol- ogy to sustain his theory, totally ignores what psychology has to offer on the subject of evalua- tion. "Why do people make statements about works of art? The answer is triviality; they do so because they make value statements about every- thing else in the world." Is it really trivial to say that the paintings of Vermeer are superior to those of DeHooch and Ochtervelt, since the last two are basically descriptive? And to say that the evidence for this evaluation is in the paintings themselves? And to suggest that if men evaluate, there may be a biological basis for their need to evaluate? When on page 199 Peckham draws up a table of Primary Signs in Four Arts, he makes value judgments without apparently being aware of it, as anyone would be obliged to do if he wanted to say that the sense of demand is shown in painting and architecture by verti- cality and the sense of acceptance by horizontal- ity. Individual works of art escape this categoriz- ing. Is the garden front of Versailles an experience of verticality and what is feminine about it? Bonnington did not think of it as feminine when he made his vigorous oil sketch REVIEW S of it. Contemporary painters, who make a business of challenging these old cliches about what is what, put an end to this kind of think- ing. If the sense of inadequacy is shown in painting by shadow, Peckham has not looked hard enough at many paintings of Monet and Bonnard. In poetry, Peckham finds no primary signs for the sense of inadequacy, fixity (rejection), flexibility (openness), expression, and inhibition, although in painting black is a sign of fixity, white of flexibility, yellow-white saturation of expression, purple-black saturation of inhibi- tion. This enables him later to call poetry limited in its primary signs. To me this is evaluation, which Peckham calls trivial. The minute I say that black is for me wonderfully open as in a Franz Kline, I show that Peckham's signs are his evaluations. The minute I fill in his list of primary signs for poetry with free verse for flexibility, I show that poetry is not so limited as he thinks. It is a weakness of Peckham's book that while he scorns artistic evaluation, he uses it himself without conscious- ness. As to his thesis, Peckham offers much that is illuminating. His point of view is that the artist's role is "to create occasions for disorienta- tion, and of the perceiver's role to experience it. The distinguishing mark of the perceiver's transaction with the work of art is discontinuity of experience, not continuity; disorder, not order; emotional disturbance, not emotional catharsis, even though some works of art have a cadential close, or the explicit presentation of the implied form." When Peckham keeps to illustration of this point, he is informing, as long as the reader holds in mind that this theory makes difficult the explanation of artists like Vermeer and Poussin, whom Peckham ignores, and Cezanne when he "revives Poussin," as he called it. I did not like to read on the jacket of this book that "all previous examinations, studies, and compendiums of aesthetics are wrong," be- cause they are "based on false premises con- cerning human beings, whose biology, behavior, and capabilities in the fields of auditory and visual artistic perception have never been ade- quately studied." The statement is false. Is it not the fact of inadequate study that makes us respectful of what we do not know of our- selves and of others? Certainly discontinuity is a factor in the creation and perception of works of art, and with evaluation, is part of the biology of man. DONALD WEEKS Berkeley, California</page></plain_text>
