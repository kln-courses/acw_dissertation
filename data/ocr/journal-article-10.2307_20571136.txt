<plain_text><page sequence="1">CATHAY AGAIN The Great White Wall, by William Rose Benet. Yale Univ. Press. The heroic narrative in verse, in which anthropomorphic gods and brawny heroes stride through countless cantos of hexameter, is necessarily out of vogue in these days of stac cato short-stories in vers libre and pithy etchings that reduce a life to an epigram. Yet there is something in us that goes [322]</page><page sequence="2">Cathay again behind the vogue, that escapes now and again from the stern censorship of our intellect and revels with a childlike glee in fierce bearded heroes with glittering swords, in lovely maidens in distress, in the color and gleam and swing of a crisp narrative in decorative verse. And as for the Arabian Nights, in whatever form we find them, it will be a merci fully long day before we lose our delight in them. All these elements William Rose Benet has gathered to gether into a really enchanting tale in his latest book, The Great White Wall. He has called for his enchantment on all the ancient sources, on Kublai Kahn, on ancient Cathay, on Persia and India and Arabia; but the enchantment re mains authentic, and Mr. Benet is at his happiest in evoking it. The lines are everywhere agleam with color, as in these, from the description of the army of Timur the Terrible on the march: Pheasant feather and peacock plume from many a marching head dress glitters. Bows on backs, a crowd of archers bronzely swings along as one. Herds of antelope, goat, and nihlgao straggle along the armies' fringes. Mimics, sorcerers, and buffoons in parti-colored costumes pass. Dancing girls with golden anklets trip in the desert dust that singes. High upheld above their bearers, banners stream from poles of brass. Over all the embroidered arms of Samarcand, the City Splendid: Lion and Sun and Three Great Circles, threefold realms that signify, Blaze on a banner of gold brocade. And, densely by his troops attended, Odmar, leading the Avant-guard, to a blare of terrible horns goes by.

The framework of heroic measure is here, but so well does he halt and vary it that nowhere, even to the ear of the sophisticated, is the sense rocked to sleep in the cradle of the metre; and the ambitions and the love of Timur stand out almost as starkly as from prose. In the end too, while not losing the elaborate brightness of the key, he lends a note of human truth to the tale by having Timur's spiritual defeat come at the moment of his greatest physical triumph. There is a distinct place in American poetry for Mr. Benet's jewelled stories, and it is to be hoped that he will give us more of them. E. T.</page></plain_text>
