A Reanalysis of Thyroid Neoplasms in the Israeli Tinea Capitis Study Accounting for Dose Uncertainties. Ra- diat. Res. 161, 359-368 (2004). In the 1940s and 1950s, children in Israel were treated for tinea capitis by irradiation to the scalp to induce epilation. Follow-up studies of these patients and of other radiation- exposed populations show an increased risk of malignant and benign thyroid tumors. Those analyses, however, assume that thyroid dose for individuals is estimated precisely without er- ror. Failure to account for uncertainties in dosimetry may affect standard errors and bias dose-response estimates. For the Israeli tinea capitis study, we discuss sources of uncer- tainties and adjust dosimetry for uncertainties in the predic- tion of true dose from X-ray treatment parameters. We also account for missing ages at exposure for patients with multi- ple X-ray treatments, since only ages at first treatment are known, and for missing data on treatment center, which in- vestigators use to define exposure. Our reanalysis of the dose response for thyroid cancer and benign thyroid tumors indi- cates that uncertainties in dosimetry have minimal effects on dose-response estimation and for inference on the modifying effects of age at first exposure, time since exposure, and other factors. Since the components of the dose uncertainties we describe are likely to be present in other epidemiological stud- ies of patients treated with radiation, our analysis may pro- vide a model for considering the potential role of these uncertainties. ? 2004 by Radiation Research Society INTRODUCTION Standard methods for analysis of epidemiological data assume that covariates are known without error for all study subjects, even though it is well recognized that as- signed dose does not perfectly reflect dose to target tissue. Ignoring misclassified covariates in analysis can bias es- timates of dose response, distort the shape of the dose-re- sponse relationship, and affect inference on the variation of the dose response across other factors (effect modifiers) (1). Adjustment for errors in dosimetry increases dose-response estimates by about 10% in Japanese atomic bomb survivors (2, 3), 50-100% in populations exposed to residential radon (4-8) and 60% in radon-exposed Colorado Plateau uranium miners, where adjustment also reduces the variation of the dose response by dose rate (9). Among nuclear workers, adjustment for dose uncertainties increases standard errors by about 40% but leaves dose-response estimates for leu- kemia unchanged (10). Failure to account for uncertainties during the design of an epidemiological study can reduce study power (11). Some of these topics were discussed at a conference on adjustments for errors in radiation studies (12). In the current paper, we consider a study which uses a dosimetry system based on an externally estimated dose- prediction equation. The use of an external prediction equa- tion is widely applicable to radiation studies and to epide- miological studies more generally. For example, dosimetry for individuals exposed to radiation fallout from nuclear weapons tests relies on models of dispersal, deposition, transfer and uptake applied to covariate information from personal interviews (13, 14). In a large cohort study of radiological technologists, dosimetry is based on a regres- sion model using an independent set of film badge mea- surements and linking those values with radiological pro- cedure, calendar period, type of facility, and other variables. The dose estimation equation is then applied to work pat- terns of individual radiologists in the study population (15). In an epidemiological case-control study of bladder cancer in three states in New England, one of us (JHL) is involved in developing prediction models for arsenic and other pol- lutants in drinking water based on the regressions of mea- surements of pollutants from water samples on geological features, type of aquifer, land use patterns, source of water, and other factors. The regression models will then be used with questionnaire data to estimate exposures of study sub- jects. In this paper, we examine uncertainties in an Israeli co- hort study of children exposed to radiation in the treatment 'Address for correspondence: Biostatistics Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, 6120 Executive Boulevard, MSC 7244, Bethesda MD 20892; e-mail: lubinj@mail.nih. gov. 359</page><page sequence="2">360 LUBIN ET AL. of tinea capitis and the effects of uncertainties on dose- response analyses of malignant and benign thyroid tumors. A link between X irradiation to the head and neck in child- hood and increased rates of thyroid cancer and benign thy- roid tumors has been reported widely (16-23). A pooled analysis of primary data from seven studies confirms the cancer association (24). For the Israeli data, Ron et al. (19) used results from three independent studies of anthropomorphic phantoms (16, 25, 26) to estimate dose to the thyroid based on age at first irradiation (A), filtration of the X-ray machine (F), prescribed radiation exposure in roentgens (R), and number of treatments. We derive a prediction equation for true dose based on V = (A, F, R) using data from phantom studies, then apply the prediction equation using A, F, R and num- ber of treatments from patient records. The presence of missing values for A, F and R for approximately 12% of patients adds complexity to the analysis. While our results may not apply directly to other epi- demiological studies that base exposure assessment on an external prediction equation, they may offer insights into effects of exposure uncertainties to the extent that stochas- tic mechanisms of those uncertainties are similar. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Population and Disease Ascertainment The study population consists of 10,834 children who received X-ray therapy for tinea capitis between 1948-1960 at three main treatment cen- ters in Israel. For each irradiated subject, a general population comparison was selected from the Central Population Registry, matched on sex, age (_12 years), country of birth, and year of immigration (+ 1 year), resulting in 10,834 nonirradiated subjects from the general population. A second comparison group consists of 5,392 siblings of the irradiated patients, who did not have tinea capitis. Siblings were matched on age (_5 years), country of origin, and year of immigration (+ 1 year), with preference given to siblings of the same sex as the irradiated patient. All subjects either immigrated to Israel from Africa or Asia or were children of fathers who had immigrated from those regions. The study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards at NIH and at the Chaim Sheba Medical Center in Israel. Follow-up methods differed depending on year and tumor type. For thyroid cancer, follow-up was between 1950-1986. Thyroid cancers in- cident between 1960-1986 were identified by linking the study roster to the Israel Cancer Registry, which was established in 1960, and confirmed through pathology and medical records. Cancers incident between 1950- 1960 were ascertained in a nationwide search of hospital pathology rec- ords. Benign thyroid tumors, which are not recorded by the Israel Cancer Registry, were identified through a nationwide search of pathology rec- ords and limited to 1950-1980. Among irradiated subjects, 44 thyroid cancers and 55 benign thyroid tumors were ascertained. Among nonir- radiated subjects, 16 developed thyroid cancer and 41 developed benign tumors. Radiotherapy Patients received radiotherapy to five overlapping fields on the scalp to induce epilation (19, 26, 27). Patients wore a cap to locate the fields, with lead shielding covering the face and neck, but were not otherwise immobilized. Beams were superficial X rays, 70-100 kVp, and either unfiltered or filtered with 0.5, 0.6 or 1.0 mm aluminum. All patients were less than 16 years old at treatment. The usual course of treatment consisted of five sessions over five con- secutive days, totaling 375 R (9.7 X 10-2 C/kg) exposure in air. The prescribed exposure ranged from 350 to 400 R depending on the treat- ment clinic (16). Nine percent of patients had further infestation and received multiple treatments, with repeat treatments occurring one or more years apart. Data Preparation As in Ron et al. (19), we ignore the individual matching and assume that responses of all subjects are independent. Ignoring matching is jus- tified for the population-based comparison group since we adjust for the matching variables. We are not justified in treating siblings as indepen- dent. However, since there are only six thyroid cancers and six benign tumors in comparison siblings, none with a treated sibling who developed thyroid disease, it is unlikely that correctly accounting for sibling depen- dence, which complicates analysis, has an impact on results. Tinea capitis is contagious and may affect family members, resulting in the inclusion of some siblings and cousins in the exposed group. Familial relationships are not recorded, so we must assume that familial effects on the dose response are small. We apply standard Poisson regression methodology (28), using the Epicure computer program (29). Data are cross-tabulated by sex (two levels), country of origin (three levels: Africa, Asia, Israel), age at first treatment in years (eight levels: 0-1, 2-4, ..., 14-16), number of treat- ments (three levels: 0, 1, 2+), follow-up year (five levels: 1950-1964, 1965-1969, 1970-1974, 1975-1979, 1980-1987), attained age in years (eight levels: 0-14, 15-19, ..., 40-44, 45+) and dose in centigrays (cGy) (six levels: 0, 1-7.4, 7.5-14, 15-22.4, 22.5-29, 30-100). For be- nign tumors, the latter 2-year categories are merged since follow-up was through 1980. For each cell of the cross-classification, we count person- years at risk and number of events (thyroid cancers or benign tumors) and compute person-year weighted means for continuous variables (at- tained age, dose, etc.). We compute time since first treatment after the cross-tabulation as attained age minus age at first treatment. Model for Risk of Disease We assume that incidence rate for disease outcome (thyroid cancer or benign tumor) within the ith cell of the cross-tabulation, denoted r,, has the following form: r,(X, D, t, ) = ro(X, c)(1 + P*D), (1) where D is total radiation dose to the thyroid, X is a covariate vector, and ot is a vector of parameters describing the disease incidence rate among nonexposed, ro. The parameter 3* represents the dose-response effect. The relative risk in Eq. (1) is linear in dose; however, for technical rea- sons we re-parameterize P* as exp(p). Effect modification is modeled by adding covariates in the multiplicative factor exp(p). Let W be a vector of recorded information on each subject, including number of treatments, codes for treatment centers, and age at first treat- ment. We assume that once covariates (X) and true dose (D) are known, W provides no additional information on disease occurrence. The regres- sion calibration approach inserts the expected value of the true dose given W, denoted E(D IW, 0), where 0 are parameters relating true dose to W. Assuming rare disease, the relative risk given the observed data X and W, can be written r,(X, W, o, 1, 0) = ro(X, o) [1 + P3*E(DI W, 0)]. (2) If 0 and E(D I W, 0) are known, then true dose can be calculated for each subject and standard methods used to estimate P3. However, it is more typical that 0 is unknown. Our approach independently estimates 0, denoted 0, inserts E(D I W, 0) in Eq. (2), and proceeds with standard analyses treating 0 as known. While this approach typically works well for estimation, it does not account for the estimation of 0, and thus some ad hoc adjustment may be needed to characterize accurately the variance of the estimate of p3.

The regression calibration and the likelihood approaches results in nearly identical esti- mates, so we present only the regression calibration results. MODELING RADIATION DOSE UNCERTAINTIES Our approach to adjust for dose uncertainties requires three steps. (1) We develop a prediction equation for true dose D from V = (A, F, R) using data from phantom stud- ies, which incorporates estimates of model uncertainties and allows computation of the expected true dose, E(D I V). (2) Patient records do not provide V = (A, F, R) for all treatments and for all subjects. We therefore must adjust for missing patient data. (3) We combine the prediction equation with the observed and imputed covariates for each patient to derive an expected true dose. Table 1 lists the various uncertainties and our approach. V = (A, F, R) for each exposure is the vector of variables required for the prediction equation, and W is the vector of covariates actually available for each patient, i.e. age at first exposure, number of treatments, and treatment center. The distinction between W and V is important. V represents var- iables required by the prediction equation, while W repre- sents variables actually available for each patient. If patient information is complete, i.e., W = V, then the phantom- based prediction equation, along with the uncertainties, al- lows computation of E(D I V). If V is not known, we must determine the expected true dose given the available data, E(D I W), by averaging the prediction equation E(D I V) over the probability distribution of the required variables given the available data, VI W. For patients with multiple treatments, we evaluate each treatment separately and assume that total true dose D is the sum of j = 1,...., J treatment doses, D = 2j Dj. Dose uncertainties induce two subtleties that affect the person-years table. Poisson regression requires that cut- points for factors in the person-years table are fixed and not random variables. Thus categorization must use true dose, not estimated dose. While attained age and other fac- tors are assumed known precisely, dose is known only with uncertainty. For the regression calibration, we categorize using expected true dose, i.e. E(D I W, 0). A second subtlety in the person-years table is that num- ber of treatments and age at treatment is considered fixed at start of follow-up, although these factors are time-depen- dent for patients with multiple treatments. Thus precise cat- egories for these factors at each year of follow-up are un- known. We include these factors as fixed variables, al- though we use an imputed age at treatment in the calcula- tion of true dose. Since only five thyroid cancers and six benign tumors occur among patients with multiple treat- ments, this simplification should have little impact. The Prediction Equation for True Dose D from Predictor Variables V Dosimetry for the tinea capitis study is based on exper- imental studies that exposed phantoms under treatment con- ditions (16, 25, 26, 31). Initial studies indicated a thyroid dose of about 0.06 Gy per treatment for a 6-year-old child. However, concerns about the effects of imperfect position- ing and patient movement led to additional studies and a</page><page sequence="4">362 LUBIN ET AL. dose adjustment of 1.5 and an estimated dose for a 6-year- old child of about 0.09 Gy (16). We do not know if the true effect on dose of squirming children was captured, but we nonetheless include this adjustment. For the dose prediction equation, let g,(.) be thyroid dose as a function of skin exposure R and filtration F for a 6- year-old child, A - 6, and assume that dose is proportional to exposure for fixed F. Let g2(.) denote the age adjustments for dose relative to a 6-year-old child. For ages 1, ... , 15, the adjustment factors are 1.70, 1.50, 1.39, 1.25, 1.10, 1.00, 0.90, 0.82, 0.74, 0.66, 0.63, 0.60, 0.59, 0.58 and 0.56, re- spectively. We assume that g2 is the same for males and females under age 16 years and accurately reflects the im- pact of age on dose. The adjustments, which reflect differ- ent head and neck sizes, are larger for younger children since their thyroid glands are closer to the radiation source. Although there are some phantom data based on skulls from children of different ages (25), data are insufficient to check the variation of dose with age at treatment (i.e. size of the phantom) empirically, so we assume that these adjustment factors relative to the referent age of the phantom are known. The age adjustment factors were developed for U.S. children, so we must assume that the factors reflect the same relative relationship in the treated Israeli children. Based on phantom data (16, 25), we assume the follow- ing model for D given V = (A, F, R): log(D)= log[g,(R, F) X g2(A) x error] log(R) + 00 + 01,F2 + log(CA) + e + e, + ,, where 00 and 08 are unknown parameters and Ew, eb and E, are random errors representing within-individual, between- individual, and random uncertainties, respectively. We as- sume that uncertainties are independent and normally dis- tributed, with mean zero and standard deviations u,, Ua and a,, respectively, thus implying that D is lognormally dis- tributed. The within-individual random uncertainty e, reflects the different thyroid doses if a child were irradiated twice under the same prescribed conditions, due to movement during treatment and differences in positioning the body for treat- ment. The between-individual random uncertainty eb re- flects the different thyroid doses for different children of identical ages under ideal machine conditions, due to dif- ferences in head size and shape. The uncertainty er reflects additional random uncertainty. Phantom data are not suffi- cient to jointly estimate 0o and 01, their variances, and or, ab and a,. We therefore estimate these parameters using various data sources. We estimate aO, = 0.17, based on 13 degrees of freedom, from the data of Modan, in which a phantom was repeatedly repositioned and reirradiated. An estimate of ab from a study of three phantoms (25) is a = 0.49, based on two degrees of freedom. There are no data for estimating o, A study of a single X-ray machine found that the actual skin exposure might differ from the prescribed amount by 15% or more (26).

The values of these estimates are assessed by a sensitivity anal- ysis. With 00 = -3.9 and 0, = 0.5 estimated from the data of Modan, the mean of a lognormal distribution is E[D IV = (A, R, F)] CAR exp 3.9 + 0.5F2+ 2 b . (3) For example, for a 6-year-old (CA = 1.0), with R = 375, F = 0.5 filtration, 6, = 0.17, 6b = 0.49, and 6, = 0.25, the expected true dose is 375 x exp(-3.9 + 0.5 X 0.25 + 0.17) = 10.2 cGy. Modeling Dose Predictor Variables V from Available Patient Data W This step is necessary because patient data are not com- plete for all subjects. When data are missing or indeter- minant, we link data for W for each subject [age at first treatment, treatment clinic(s), year of first treatment, and number of treatments] to clinic-specific information (types of X-ray machines, filtration, standard treatment protocols, and machine settings) to determine the required variables V = (A, F, R) for the dose prediction model. For example, we know only age at first treatment for those with multiple treatments and therefore impute values for ages of second and later irradiations. Figure 1 shows a histogram of ages at first irradiation. For those with multiple treatments, we impute an age at subsequent treatment by randomly select- ing an age from the histogram, conditional on age at prior treatment plus 1 year, the minimum time between treat- ments, and treatment under age 16.

However, the precise machine used on a particular patient was not recorded. For some patients the treatment center was abroad or unknown. For those with multiple treatments, the sequence of the treatment centers was not known. Table 2 shows the imputation approaches we use. For example, in treatment centers 2 and 3, machines had common filtrations and nominal exposures, although at dif- ferent values. In treatment center 1, there were four ma- chines, with filtrations (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.6) and nominal ex- posures (400, 384, 383, NA), where NA denoted not avail- able. For treatment center 1, we assume that the filtration was 0.5 with probability 0.75 and 0.6 with probability 0.25. For nominal exposures, we assume that the distribution was 400, 384, 383 and distributed uniformly between 350 and 425, reflecting the range of nominal exposures recorded in the various centers, each with probability 0.25. For those with an unknown treatment center, we assume that filtration was 1.0, and nominal exposure was distributed uniformly between 350 and 425. For those irradiated abroad, we as- sume that nominal exposure was distributed uniformly be- tween 350 and 425, and assume filtration values (0.0, 0.5, 1.0) with probabilities (0.10, 0.85, 0.05), a distribution in keeping with the observed filtrations. Among 27,060 children, 5,451 (20.1%) and 15,799 (58.4%) immigrated themselves or had a father who had immigrated from Asia or Africa, respectively. The remain- ing 5,810 (21.5%) children were born in Israel but had a father who immigrated from Asia or Africa. Ninety-three percent of Asian children and 79% of African children had no listed month of birth, and we assume that birth occurred on June 15. Nearly all children of Israeli birth had a listed birth month. Dates of cohort entry were known, but uncer- tainty in birth month meant that ages at first treatment for patients and ages at entry for comparison subjects were accurate only to the nearest integer. Birth month for those with a complete birth date was distributed uniformly throughout the year, suggesting no systematic bias from this age rounding. Finally, we assume that all other sources of random un- certainty, such as fluctuations in machine power output, ma- chine on-time, treatment records, etc., were minimal. Combining the Dose Prediction Model and Patient Data The final step is to compute the expected true dose from the available patient data and the prediction equation. For a patient with J treatments, the expected dose is E(D IW, ) = L 0 E(DjI V, 0)f(Vj Wj,) dVj, (4) where E(DjJ Vj,0) is dose from the prediction equation, and the determination of required data from available data, VjI Wj, is described above.

" No observed events. RESULTS Expected true doses are generally larger than original doses. Person-year weighted means for original doses and expected true doses were 9.4 and 10.8 cGy, respectively, for treated patients, 10.1 and 11.6 for thyroid cancer cases, and 10.2 and 11.5 cGy for benign tumor cases. A total of 1,020 of 10,832 irradiated patients (9.4%), including 5 of 44 thyroid cancer cases (11.4%) and 6 of 55 benign tumors (10.9%), had more than one treatment (Table 3). Mean ex- pected doses are higher than mean original doses for each category of number of treatments. Figure 2 shows expected true doses and original doses, the 45-degree line, and the linear least-squares regression line. For one treatment, ex- pected dose is generally higher than original dose, primarily due to the mean of the lognormal distribution being higher than the median. Slopes of the fitted lines for patients with multiple treatments are less than one (Fig. 2), indicating that higher original doses correspond to progressively lower true doses. This pattern is due to the age adjustment for multiple exposures and to failure of the original doses to account for ages at second or later treatment. Table 4 shows numbers of exposed cases and estimated ERRs per centigray using original doses or expected true doses, and the relative impact of effect modifiers. Since original doses are generally less than expected true doses, the ERR/cGy for thyroid cancer estimated using expected true doses (0.31 with 95% CI 0.14-0.64) is 12% smaller than the estimate using original doses (0.35 with 95% CI 0.16-0.73) (Fig. 3). Differences in the ERR/cGy using un- adjusted and adjusted doses are small, and the use of ex- pected dose does not significantly improve model fit com- pared to observed dose (P = 0.73).

Individual relative risk estimates located at the category-specific, person-year weighted mean dose. Fitted dose re- sponse based on a linear relative risk model. Tests of homogeneity of the ERR/cGy by sex are non- significant, although the results suggest different sex effects in the dose response for thyroid cancer and benign tumors (Table 4). The dose response for males relative to females is about 0.2 using either dose estimate but about 2.0 for benign tumors. The differences by sex for thyroid cancer and benign nodules, however, are not statistically signifi- cant (for example, P = 0.15 using expected true dose). Data on sex, number of treatments, time and age-related factors are assumed known with a high degree of accuracy. The relative impact of those factors and the P values for tests of homogeneity are unaffected by uncertainty in do- simetry (Table 4). Effects of radiation exposure on thyroid cancer risk are highest in patients exposed under the age of 5, remain elevated 25 years and more after initial irra- diation, and are smaller in patients with multiple treatments, although tests of homogeneity are not statistically signifi- cant. DISCUSSION Our analysis characterizes uncertainties in thyroid dosim- etry for childhood irradiation for the treatment of tinea cap- itis and extends the analysis in Schafer et al. (30). The current paper demonstrates the use of an external prediction equation in conjunction with adjustment through regression calibration and presents a more complete analysis of thy- roid cancer, as well as an analysis of benign thyroid tumors. Dosimetric uncertainties are due to a variety of factors, in- cluding uncertainty in the model for true dose based on studies of phantoms, random differences in sizes of children of a given age, and random movements by children during treatment. Additional uncertainties arise from missing data for ages at subsequent exposure for those with multiple treatments and for treatment center. Results are reassuring that within the limitations of our understanding uncertain- ties in dosimetry have minimal impact on estimates of ERR/cGy and on statistical inference on the role of age at treatment, time since exposure, and other effect modifiers for both thyroid cancer and benign thyroid tumors. The relationship between original doses and our predicted doses varies by categories of number of treatments and highlights the importance of the adjustment for age at treatment in the dosimetry for patients with multiple treatments. While our assessment includes most major sources of uncertainty, we do not explicitly account for all uncertain- ties. In the prediction equation, we assume that measure- ment error associated with the conduct of the phantom stud- ies is minimal, including instrument calibration and eval- uation of embedded dosimeters, that the adjustment factors for physical differences in ages at treatment relative to the referent 6-year-old child are correct, and that age adjust- ment factors apply equally to females and males and to Israeli children of diverse ethnic backgrounds. External dose-prediction equations are widely applicable and in the simplest setting are very intuitive. For subjects i = 1, ... , n, suppose there is a linear relationship between disease response Yi and true dose Di, denoted E(Yi I D) = 3 + P3D~D. However, the primary data set yields Y, and only a vector of surrogate variables Vi, which may be viewed as Di recorded with uncertainty or more generally a vector of variables that characterize D1. (Our analysis was further complicated by some patients with missing values for V.) An independent set of data consisting of Dj and V, for j = 1, ..., m exists, with Dj and Vj defined by the relationship E(DJ Vi) = 00 + 0 V,. (This relationship was loglinear in our data.) A sensible approach estimates 00 and 0, from the secondary data, then uses those estimates to predict a value for Di for each subject in the primary data, i.e. E(D, I V1). The Y's and the predicted variables E(D I V,) are then used to estimate the risk parameters 30 and p3 . The</page><page sequence="8">366 LUBIN ET AL.

If the prediction equation is precisely true without un- certainty and if predictor variables are known for all sub- jects in the primary data, then standard statistical methods apply, since the equation produces true doses. More typi- cally, the prediction includes uncertainty. One source of uncertainty arises from the estimation of the parameters in the prediction equation. The prediction is thus an "esti- mate" of true dose. In the statistical literature, this type of uncertainty is often called "classical error", which tends to reduce effects and create curvilinearity. With a prediction equation, this uncertainty represents a "shared error" com- mon to all subjects (32). A second source of uncertainty results from the random deviation of the (log) dose predic- tion for each subject from the (log) true dose. This latter uncertainty is called (multiplicative) "Berkson error". For rare diseases and relative risks which are approximately linear in dose, Berkson error tends to increase variance while inducing minimal bias. Technical details of analyses with external prediction equations are given in Schafer et al. (30). The prediction equation is applied to patient data ac- counting for missing data on treatment clinic, the exact X- ray machine used if more than one, nominal exposure, and ages at subsequent treatments for those with multiple treat- ments. The imputation of these missing data are presumably unbiased for the true covariate data, and so only increase variability. The extent to which we do not correctly account for the random process generating the missing data or ig- nore systematic influences is unknown; however, any resid- ual random or systematic errors are likely small. We find parameter estimates, standard errors and infer- ences essentially unchanged, after accounting for uncertain- ty. The results in Table 4 are based on random errors in Eq. (4) of (aw, Ub, r) = (0.17, 0.49, 0.15) but are similar when standard errors for the uncertainties are specified as</page><page sequence="9">ADJUSTING FOR DOSE UNCERTAINTIES 367 TABLE 4 Extended Adenoma Nodule Original Model N Original Model N 0.138 0.124 26 0.135 0.115 29 (0.02, 0.37) (0.02, 0.32) (0.04, 0.30) (0.03, 0.26) 0.126 0.114 22 0.114 0.097 23 1.553 1.475 4 2.105 2.062 6 0.75 0.79 0.49 0.50 - 2 1- 1 0.207 0.185 19 0.208 0.178 20 5 0.291 0.303 8 0.04 0.04 0.09 0.09 0.872 0.873 5 -- 2 0.155 0.136 9 0.096 0.083 8 1.405 1.423 12 3.305 3.325 17 0 1.495 1.551 2 0.29 0.29 0.02 0.02 0.156 0.139 7 0.346 0.303 13 0.709 0.728 10 0.246 0.252 11 1.087 1.037 9 -- 5 0.89 0.91 0.002 0.001 0.200 0.171 25 0.118 0.100 24 0.039 0.033 1 1.465 1.558 5 0.08 0.10 0.59 0.54 (0.17, 0.25, 0.25) or (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). These parameters spec- ify Berkson error from the uncertainty in expected true dose for the prediction equation. Even extreme values appear not to influence the estimates of dose response or effect mod- ification. The error model, Eq. (3), includes two parameters (0o and 0f), which define the relationship between added filtration and dose and are estimated from phantom studies. This uncertainty results in classical error. Results suggest that this classical error is small relative to random predi- cation error from phantom studies. The confidence intervals in Table 4 are similar using original doses or expected true doses because the regression calibration does not account for the variability arising from measurement error. The full likelihood approach, which does account for measurement errors, results in slightly larger standard errors (30). Those results suggest that upper and lower confidence limits should be multiplied and di- vided by a factor of about 1.06, respectively. Although patterns of effect modification of the dose re- sponse for thyroid cancer by categories of sex, attained age, time since exposure, age at first exposure, and number of treatments are statistically consistent with homogeneity, the direction of the dose-response variations is similar to the patterns found in a pooled analysis of seven studies (24). In particular, the pooled analysis indicates an increased risk with younger ages at exposure, a pattern suggested in the current analysis. It may be argued that the age-at-exposure variation is due at least in part to the age adjustment that is applied in the dosimetry, with the increased risk at youn- ger ages due to adjustment parameters which are too small. While we cannot entirely rule this out, the age adjustment factors for children under age 5 years would need to be nearly doubled to account entirely for the greater radiation effect at the youngest ages at exposure. The age adjustment factors were established independently of the tinea capitis study and were based on physical characteristics of chil- dren. In addition, similar patterns of risk with age at ex- posure are observed consistently in studies of thyroid dis- ease and childhood radiation exposure (24). Thus it seems unlikely that the age-at-exposure effects are entirely the re- sult of the age adjustment. In summary, our analysis of thyroid cancer and benign thyroid tumors in the Israeli tinea capitis study, accounting for a variety of dosimetric uncertainties, indicates that these uncertainties have relatively little influence on the estimated dose response and on inference regarding potential effect modifiers. The similarity of the unadjusted and the adjusted results in the Israeli data is the result of the linearity of</page><page sequence="10">368 LUBIN ET AL. relative risk in dose and the predominance of Berkson-type error. Since the components of the dose uncertainties we describe are likely to be present in other epidemiological studies of patients treated with radiation, our analysis may provide a model for considering the potential role of these uncertainties.
