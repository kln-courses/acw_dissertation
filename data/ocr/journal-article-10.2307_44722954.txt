Ulrika Wallersteiner Brent Sauder Ergo Systems Canada Inc. B.C. Advanced Systems Institute Jack Wilson Nariman Sepehri RSI Research Ltd. University of Manitoba ABSTRACT Recent computer-based improvements in excavator-type machines have addressed fuel economy and power delivery to the implement for various types of tasks. Although some developments have been made in task-specific bucket control, the basic pattern of hand control motions for operating these machines has remained little changed over many years. This paper reports on a hand control interface, its computer-based hydraulic control system and the results of human factors studies carried out on a Cat 215B-based log loader. By means of a set of real-time excavator simulator stud- ies, a new approach to directing the control of the implement motion has been developed. A testbed machine was made available by Caterpillar and die control system was imple- mented on an excavator, a log loader and at present is also being implemented on a feller-buncher. A commercial ver- sion of the concept has also been successfully implemented on grapple yarders. A single hand controller has been developed to allow the operator to match the hand controller's translational direction of motion in X, Y and Z, to the visually-determined desired direction of motion of the implement. A machine control system was designed to ensure that the implement follows die commanded direction of motion specified by the hand controller within the capabilities of the hydraulic system. Two different control systems have been investigated - with and without pressure sensing. Results of the human factors testing on novices and ex- perienced operators is reported. The results compare machine operation using standard machine hand controls and coordi- nated controls. INTRODUCTION The objective of the work described in this paper was to examine the benefits that could be obtained by modifying the hand controls on excavator-based machines so that the operator would directly control the motion of the implement in space rather than having to coordinate the movement of all the links to provide implement motion in space. Such a system would then completely conform to the spirit of the ISO 1503- 1977 standard which states; " Movements in control elements and the intended changes in the considered object should be logically coordinated '. In other words if the "considered object" is a bucket, when the hand controller is pushed forward, one would expect the bucket to move in the same direction (i.e. forward). Similarly when an upwards motion is desired of the bucket, one would naturally expect a corresponding upwards motion of the hand controller to cause that motion. The computer-based control system necessary to translate movements of such a hand con- troller into hydraulic servo commands we have called "coordi- nated control". The purpose of this paper is to describe the progress made to date towards the above-mentioned objective of achieving coordinated control and measuring its benefits. Excavator hand controls have not changed much in prin- ciple over the years. Single levers, each of which controlled one kinematic joint, have been replaced by a pair of two- degree-of-freedom joysticks. For many years the mapping of joystick action to link function was not standardized resulting in increased potential for accidents. The SAE J 1177 June88 standard and the recent Canadian CSA-M3789.4-91 standard have now defined a consistent mapping of machine joint mo- tion to hand control direction for excavators and log loaders respectively (see Figure la). The motivation for the work described in this paper was to improve productivity and ease of equipment use and was inspired by an analogy to human movement. In order to pick up an object with the hand, one moves one's hand in the direction of the object. The direction of motion is determined by visually observing the location of the object relative to the hand. One is generally not conscious of the coordination of the torso, upper arm and lower arm required to carry out the reaching task. In the context of the present-day control of an excavator- based log loader, the above-mentioned "hand" is a grapple. The motion of the grapple to the log is accomplished by the operator by coordinating the motion of the swing, boom and stick joysticks. 470</page><page sequence="2">A new 3D joystick (see Figure lb) capable of moving in any direction in 3D space (X, Y, Z directions) would allow the operator to command the grapple to move in whatever direction the joystick is dellected from a spring-centered position. (Note that implement rotations such as Roll, Pitch or Yaw can also be added.) Any attempt to reduce the number of directions of the joystick by putting the Z axis on another joystick, for example, would result in loading the operator with the additional task of having to resolve the intended motion into two components, a direction in the XY plane on one hand and a component in the Z direction on the other hand. Thus the premise of the work was that the operator could easily perceive the direction in which the grapple must move and push a 3D joystick in the same direction. Figure 1. Two types of hand controls. POSITION CONTROL - In the terminology used in this paper, the direct control of each joint to achieve endpoint mo- tion is called joint-space control. The control of the endpoint location in Cartesian space using inverse kinematics equations is called Cartesian-space control or workspace control. Gen- erally, the position of the hand control or input device can be used to directly control either the position of the joints of the machine (i.e. joint-space control) or the endpoint position of the machine (i.e. Cartesian-space control). It should be pointed out that there are other possibilities such as using a force on the hand control rather than a position to transduce the operator command information. An informal early study rejected some of these possibilities. One way to achieve joint control is to build a small replica of the excavator called a "master arm" and mount a position sensor on each joint of the replica. Each position sensor then becomes a reference control signal for controlling the corre- sponding slave joint. Since the joint positions of the slave arm follow the joint positions of the master arm, this mode of operation results in joint-space position-control. (Note that if one views the master arm as a form of mechanical inverse kinematics generator, and since the operator controls the "end- point" of the master arm which the slave arm follows, then this can also be called a Cartesian-space position-control system - see next paragraph). Such a system has also been termed a spatially-correspondent master-slave system. This type of sys- tem was developed for "hot-cell" manipulation in the early 1960's [1] and the concept is still in use today. For example, components of the shuttle Challenger were recovered from the sea floor using such a manipulator system [2]. A modified version suitable for anthropomorphic slave arms could use the operator's own arm, instrumented with angle sensors, as the master arm [3]. A second approach is to build a master arm that does not necessarily have the same structural geometry as the slave arm and to manually move the endpoint of that non-spatially- correspondent master arm. In this case a computer system must be employed to solve for the necessary joint angles of the slave arm so that the endpoint of the master arm can reach the same point in the scaled Cartesian space [4]. This technique is termed here Cartesian-space position-control. In an adaptation of the idea, one can simply locate the position of the operator's hand in space and map the operator's hand position, with suitable Cartesian space scaling, to the endpoint of the slave arm [5]. The operator's hand can be located with an optical or magnetic sensing system for example [5]. However, if the slave arm is very much larger than the master arm (as it is in an excavator), when the endpoint of the master arm moves a small amount, the endpoint of the slave arm will move a large amount. That is, the gain of the system Gp = (slave-position)/(master-position) is not adjustable. For this and other reasons, neither of the aforementioned position- to-position mappings are satisfactory for excavator control. VELOCITY-CONTROL - The standard method of oper- ating a 4 degree-of-freedom excavator utilizes a pair of spring- centered joysticks with two-degrees-of-freedom (joint axes) each. The deflection of a joystick about one of its joint axes away from the neutral position, results in an increase in veloc- ity of the controlled excavator joint. This then is joint-space velocity-control. It has the very desirable advantage that if the hand controls are released, all motion stops. Also, the gain 471</page><page sequence="3">of the system Gv = (slave joint velocity)/(joystick deflection from zero) is adjustable. The disadvantage of this system is that it requires an operator to learn what joint speeds are necessary at each moment in time to obtain the desired direction and speed of the implement. For example for the implement to move straight across the ground at the same level, the operator must first cause the boom to rise until the implement is directly under the stick joint, and then the operator must cause the boom to fafl all while maintaining a constant stick motion. The relation between the motions one desires to make in a Cartesian workspace and the joint angle velocities required to achieve those motions is given by the Inverse Jacobian [6]. The Inverse Jacobian is often a complex nonlinear function of joint angles. It is this mapping that the operator must learn in order to do the tasks. The solution proposed here is to use Cartesian-space velocity-control instead. Such a control system has been studied for space manipulators [7]. In the work reported here however, the operator specifies endpoint velocities in a rotating Cartesian space (see next section) via joystick positions. An on-board computer determines the necessary velocities of all the joints required to attain the specified Cartesian endpoint velocity. This removes the burden of this computation from the operator. We have termed this control "coordinated control" - a tenn that appears to be meaningful to operators. At UBC, the development of coordinated motion con- trol has been through four distinct phases. In phase one, a real-time graphical simulator was developed and human fac- tors studies were performed to assess potential benefits. Phase two consisted of implementation in a Caterpillar 215B excava- tor configured as a log loader and a human factors evaluation using two joysticks for coordinated control. Phase three con- sisted of improvements in hardware and software, and human factors studies using only a single joystick for coordinated con- trol. Phase four consisted of engineering improvements to the hydraulic control system to improve the accuracy of motion. PHASE ONE: SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS The first phase of experiments was based on a real- time graphical simulation of an excavator with the geometry of a Caterpillar 215B excavator. Early pilot studies with the simulator used a joint-space position control master (i.e. spatially correspondent master) but the principle was rejected as unworkable for controlling an excavator for many reasons (master/slave size ratio, master/slave maximum speed ratio, safety issues and others). The simulator used for these experiments was comprised of a Silicon Graphics 3130 workstation with a VME bus analog/digital interface card to which were connected two spring-centered PQ [Model M220] joysticks. The right-hand joystick had X, Y and Z axes for Cartesian control of the implement location (see Figure lb). The left hand joystick had X, Y and Rotate axes for control of implement Pitch, Roll and Yaw attitudes respectively. In the case of the first experiments, the implement was a bucket and consequently had only a Pitch function. There were 20 right-handed male subjects (students) who participated in the study. Subjects sat in a chair with a joystick on each side of the chair, facing the display. The display replicated the view through the front window of the excavator cab. Three dimensional graphical information was obtained by the subjects from perspective and other cues [8]. The subjects were presented with nine tasks over approximately a two hour period. The details of the task and complete results are given in [8]. In an industrial robot, Cartesian space commands are usu- ally specified in terms of world coordinates. In an excavator, however, the operator rotates with the cab and hence com- mands are issued in the operator's rotating frame of reference. In order for the endpoint to move in the same 3D direction as the handle of the joystick is currently deflected, the gain Gv = (endpoint workspace velocity)/(joystick deflection from zero) must be the same for all directions of deflection of the joystick. This was achieved by solving the following equations [9]: X = Ax 4- Xoid z - Az Žold d= y/x2 4- z2 Ay 01 - f~ 01 old - 1 ( 7l ' _ ļ r d2 + b2 + s2 ' 02 = tan - 1 (-)+«*- ( 7l ' _ ļ r d2 + 2bS b2 + . #3 = COS" I 2Ē . where: - Ax, Ay, Az are the increments in workspace endpoint position implied by the current joystick position. - X, y, z are the new coordinates of the endpoint, - Xoid , Zoid are the previous coordinates of the endpoint, - 0i, 02« 03« are the current joint angles of the swing, boom and stick respectively, - 0ioid is the previous value of 0i, - b, s are the length of the boom and stick respectively. The net effect of these equations is that the operator observes the direction of a line between the current endpoint and a new desired location for the endpoint. The operator pushes the joystick in that direction. As the cab rotates, the operator rotates with it and adjusts the joystick to keep pushing it "toward" the desired target location. Consequently, control of movement no longer requires learning a new coordination task. RESULTS -The results of these experiments on novices (see Figure 2) indicated that the novices were more productive using coordinated control than using the standard controls and that the advantage increased as the tasks were made more difficult (tasks bi and b2). 472</page><page sequence="4">Figure 2. Mean time to complete each trial. PHASE TWO: FIRST MACHINE EXPERIMENTS A Caterpillar 215B excavator, provided to the project by Caterpillar Inc., Peoria, was configured as a log loader (Figure 3), and was instrumented with a flexible, VME-bus based computer system for machine control system development and human factors testing. The computer system consisted of: - Ironies 16 MHz 1 Mbyte IV-3204 Motorola MC68020 CPU-board. - 16 Channel 12-bit XYCOM XVME-566 analog-to- digital interface. - 8 Channel 1 2- bit Datel DVME 628V digital-to-analog interface. - 4 Channel 14-bit VMIC VME-4940 resolver-to-digital interface. - 32-bit XYCOM XVME-212 digital input interface. - 32-bit XYCOM XVME-220 digital output interface. - Electrohydraulic valve drivers. - +5, ±12 V power supplies. - 24V- 117V 60Hz inverter. The machine hydraulic system was modified to include electrohydraulic pilot valves and pressure sensors in most pilot and main circuits. The circuit is shown in Figure 4 (solid lines only for this experiment). Resolvers were mounted on each of the excavator's joints to sense joint angles. Two hand controls were located in place of the original Caterpillar pilot controls (see Figure 5). The right hand control was a PQ [Model M220J three function control (X, Y, Z). The left hand-control (also PQ) for implement orientation had X (Pitch), Y (Roll) and Yaw Functions. The yaw function was used to rotate the grapple in either direction. The trigger switch on the right hand-controller closed the grapple and one on the left hand-controller opened the switch. The log loader was located in a field surrounded by three sets of three numbered log cradles. The subjects' task consisted of moving these logs from cradle to cradle in a designated sequence. The two different control methods (joint control and coordinated control) were compared as a function of time. The human factors experiments were set up to study 10 novices and 6 experienced log loader operators in two separate studies. The novices had about 4 hours exposure to both systems and the experienced operators had about 2-3 hours per day total on the machine over a 5 day period for both joint mode (on which baseline data was only taken during day 1) and coordinated mode. The details of the human factors studies are presented in [10]. RESULTS - The results from the human factors tests for novices are shown in Figure 6. It is clear that novices benefitted immediately from coordinated control. For experienced operators, however, it took some time to unlearn existing control patterns. The experienced operators' coordinated control performance improved with time. Two operators actually matched their joint control times at the end of day 5 (8-10 hours in coordinated mode). These results looked sufficiently promising that a third round of machine improvements and experiments were undertaken. PHASE THREE: COORDINATED CONTROL WITH ONE JOYSTICK In preparation for the third phase of the experiments, several basic modifications were made to the equipment. The hydraulic response of the machine was improved by the use of faster pilot control valves. The computer system was modified to provide both real- time control using a 20 MHz Inmos T800-based processor board and a UNIX-based SPARC- IE VME bus board on the on-board controller. This not only provided easy access to key system and experimental variables for data-logging and experiment control, but also allowed independent testing of interface cards in the bus. Also, a single hand-controller was designed for use in these experiments (see Figure 7). The 5-function hand control provided: - 3 spatial control axes (X, Y, Z) - 1 grapple yaw control axis - 1 grapple control switch (open/off/closed) The rationale for examining operation with a single hand controller was to attempt to match the human task of one- hand grasping as closely as possible within the constraints of a hand-position to endpoint-velocity mapping. In these experiments eight log loader operators with 2 to 20 years experience were used as subjects. An arrangement of log cradles aid logs approximately the same as that used for the second phase of experiments was set up. As before, subjects were evaluated initially in joint mode to obtain baseline data during the first day of experiments. For these tests two X-Y hand-controls were used in the standard pattern (boom control on the right hand). 473</page><page sequence="5">Figure 3. Caterpillar 21 5B-based log loader.

However it was found that the performance of the subjects using the single hand controller was better than the subjects using the two hand controllers. The remaining 4 subjects were given 10 1/2 hours training on the single hand controller. Two of these subjects surpassed their joint-mode baseline performance after only 6 and 8 1/2 hours, respectively. The remaining two subjects came within 5% of their joint mode performance while the two subjects who surpassed their baseline joint mode performance did so by 10%. The performance of these subjects is shown in Figure 8. More complete details of these experiments ¿ire given in [101. It was evident from this third study that the t¿tsk could be learned by experienced operators. MACHINE CONTROL SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS Although not strictly necesstiry for operation of the ma- chine with a human-operator in the loop, several bttsic modi- fications were subsequently made to the control system to im- prove system accuracy which may be important in applications such as semi-autonomous operation of the machine. The basic hydraulic circuit of the Caterpillar 215B ex- cavator is given in Figure 9. The main features are that the flow from each of two variable-displacement pumps passes through a chain of three main vtilves which give priority to functions closest to the pump. Unused flow at the end of the first two valves can be made available to the other chain via a "crossover valve". The track controls are not shown. In order to carry out coordinated motion control, actuation of several joints is required. It is clear from the previous brief description that there is a significant interdependence of hydraulic circuits. The flow interdependencies can be explicitly formulated into two sets of constraints: 1. Maximum availability constraints given by: Desired flow to each actuator &lt; Maximum ¿ivailable pump flow. 2. Interconnection constraints given by: Total flow to coupled actuators &lt; Maximum ¿ivailable pump flow. These constraints ¿ire used to determine if the flow rate in each hydraulic circuit (calculated from the operator's current demand for a coordinated endpoint velocity) is able to be supplied by the hydraulic system. If not, scale factors are applied in such a w¿iy as to maint¿iin coordin¿iled control but at a slower speed. The details of this algorithm are available in [11]. Once the cylinder flows ¿ire determined (scaled if neces- sary), a search for the ¿ipplicable crossover p¿ittern [12] (deter- mined by line pressures and check v¿dve settings), ¿ind the m¿iin spool displacements necess¿iry to obtain the cylinder flows, is made. The main spool displacements ¿ire determined by a load competition algorithm which uses cylinder pressures and desired direction of cylinder motion to determine whether the flow from ¿ictuator-to-t¿ink should be controlled or the flow from pump-to-actuator should be controlled in each valve. The combination of constraint satisfaction and load compensation we have termed a "decoupled flow compens¿itor" because it allows one to predict the valve setting for each main valve independently of other joints and load conditions, even without a feedback controller. The two components of decoupled flow compensation are shown in Figure 5. The algorithm details are given in [13]. If the flow is to be controlled by the pump-to-actuator orifice, the applicable equations are: Q - Q¡ = k a* '/P-Pe Q¡ = k a¡ '/P - Pi where: Q, Qi are the pump and desired actuator flow respectively. P, Pe, Pj are the pump, tank and actuator inlet line pressures respectively. a«, ą are the pump-to-tank, and pump-to-actuator oriface area respectively. k is the metering coefficient. These equations are iteratively solved to obtain the spool displacement which is related to both orifice areas. If the flow is controlled by the actuator-to-tank orifice, the equation used is: Qo a° kvTo - Pe where: Qo is the desired flow (from actuator to tank). P0, Pe are the actuator outlet line pressure and tank pressure respectively. a«, is the actu¿itor-to-tank oriface area. k is the metering coefficient. The PD controller also shown in Figure 5 was used with reUitively low gains to correct long term drift, and unmodeled disturbances. RESULTS - The result of the addition of the decoupled flow compensator w¿is a factor of ten improvement in accuracy of control. With the grapple close to the ground, when a command for a pure ±X motion was issued to the controller (i.e. motion along a horizontal line to/from the cab), then deviation from the line was in the range from 5 - ► 15 cm with PD control alone ¿uid 0.5 - ► 1.5 cm with the decoupled flow compensator over a range of speeds and loads. 476</page><page sequence="8">Figure 7.

Percent difference between coordinated and joint mode. 477</page><page sequence="9">DISCUSSION The general perception of coordinated control among the experienced operators tested is that it would reduce learning time for novices and that the experienced operators could adapt to it given sufficient time. The operators in general were quite positive about its potential. One lesson that we learned during the course of these experiments was that achieving results comparable to the real- time simulations studies was not as easily achieved on the actual machine. Although not reported here, some informal studies during phase one were carried out with experienced excavator operators. These studies predicted that coordinated control performance could match or exceed joint control per- formance. In reality it took several more years to actually accomplish that goal on the machine itself. One of the reasons for that is that the initial simulation only included kinematics. Thus the dynamics of the grapple, the dynamics of pilot and main valves, the interaction between the machine and the op- erator which disturbed hand control action, and the interaction between logs and the implement were not simulated. However, when the simulator was improved by adding hydraulic and mechanical dynamics, it became valuable in un- derstanding problems, modelling control ideas and determining control system gains. CONCLUSIONS The main conclusion of this paper is that coordinated control as defined in this paper permits novice operators to very significantly exceed performance limes achieved by using joint control which is the standard on excavator-based machines today. Also, we found that experienced log loader operators can approximately match their joint mode performance after 10 1/2 hours of using single joystick coordinated control. It is interesting that this is possible considering the fact that operator experience ranged up to 25 years on the standard controls. Coordinated motion can be achieved by inverse kinemat- ics computation, PD control, and electrohydraulic pilot valves acting on the main valve spools. For more critical control, an order of magnitude improvement in the accuracy of con- trol can be achieved by the use of the decoupled- fio w com- pensator described here. The compensator is comprised of a constraint satisfier and a load compensator which will allow the pre-computation of spool displacement in the main valve (or statically equivalent pilot valve voltages).
