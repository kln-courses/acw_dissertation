EFFECTS OF ALTERNATE INFORMATION STRUCTURES IN A DECOMPOSED ORGANIZATION: A LABORATORY EXPERIMENT* JEFFREY H. MOOREt The literature on the deomposition of mathematical programs as models for organizational design and resource allocation in decentralized organizations is extensive. Although models differ in detail, all conceptualize the allocation problem as a multi-level managerial coordina- tion procedure, involving local (divisional) and global (organization-wide) resources, in which informational automony is to be maintained. That is, coordination of resource usage by relatively autonomous divisions is to be effected in these models without any one agent in the organization accumulating complete knowledge of the technical resource transformations, payoff or cost coefficients and detailed plans that divisions utilize in converting resources to useful ends. Unfortunately there has been little empirical investigation into the implementa- tional problems of applying these models in decentralized organizations. This study reports on an experiment with human subjects as decision makers in a simulated decentralized organization. The formulation of the overall resource-allocation problem as a linear program permitted two forms of coordination: price-directive in which transfer pricing is used to allocate resources, and resource-directive in which a rationing or budgeting approach is used. Both schemes can be shown to solve the overall organizational problem but impose different information, communication, and decision-making structures upon the subject managers. The experiment was designed to examine comparative managerial perfor- mance by the subjects, as central coordinating agents, under the alternative transfer pricing and budgeting schemes. Within each of these schemes two levels of decision time pressure were also introduced to examine its impact upon subject performance. The purpose of the investigation was to study the influence of organizational design (allocation scheme) and situational factors (time pressure) upon human decision-making under carefully controlled experimental conditions. The experimental setting was that of a decentralized university incorporating three sub- ordinate college divisions and one coordinating agent, the president's office. The colleges were modeled as linear programs and the coordination function was assigned to the experi- mental subjects. In the price-directive scheme a subject assigned a transfer price to each of two global resources in each planning iteration. In the resource-directive scheme a subject directly allocated amounts of the two global resources to each of the colleges in each planning iteration. Consistent with decomposition theory, feedback to the subject in the form of aggregate resource demands (price-direction) or individual bids for higher resource alloca- tions (resource-direction) was given to initiate a new planning iteration. The budgetary goal utilized by subjects was to maximize net dollar contribution from colleges to the university under prespecified quality-of-education constraints. After several planning iterations each subject finalized the resource allocations, terminating the experiment. The hypotheses were that resource-directive subjects would outperform price-directive subjects, that high decision time pressure would exacerbate decision making and that subjects would outperform decomposition algorithms in early iterations. Data from the experiment did not support the first two hypotheses; the third was confirmed. Aside from concluding that strategic factors (organizational design) and tactical factors (time pressure) strongly influence decision making behavior, several specific implications can be tentatively drawn. In similar settings transfer pricing schemes may be preferable to traditional budgeting schemes for planning resource allocations. Furthermore, the potential exists for profitable use of man-machine procedures for resource allocation involving decision support technology in the form of decomposition models to augment human decision heuristics. Finally, experimental methods offer a vehicle for addressing human factors and implementational considerations missing from current analytic models.

MOORE 1. Introduction The theory of decomposition of mathematical programs as iterative planning models for the resource allocation process in decentralized organizations is extensive and well developed (Jennergren [17]). Although models differ in detail, all conceptual- ize the allocation problem as a multi-level managerial coordination procedure, involv- ing local (divisional) and global (organization-wide) resources, in which informational autonomy is to be maintained. This informational autonomy is the key notion defining organizational decentralization in these models. That is, coordination of resource usage by relatively autonomous divisions is to be effected without any one agent in the organization accumulating complete knowledge of the technical resource transformations, payoff coefficients, and detailed plans that divisions utilize in con- verting resources to useful ends. Yet in spite of this limitation the goal of these planning models is to bring about the same (optimal) resource allocation and decision making that would obtain if a centralized agent had such complete knowledge and could perform the requisite calculations.' There are several compelling arguments for decentralized planning under this informational restriction: * Although never formally considered, there is the presumption that a substantial and unnecessary cost would be incurred by the organization if all the technical information, necessary to achieve a centralized solution, must be organized and communicated to a central agent. * There is the further presumption that, once all information is communicated, the size of the resulting optimization problem at the central agency would be unwieldy and the problem therefore very costly to prepare and solve. . The total amount of technical information is very large and divisions of the organization will at any point in the planning process have identified only a small subset of the relevant resource transformations potentially needed by the central agent. * The summary information, communicated under these models, often has plau- sible economic interpretation, which facilitates evaluation of alternatives by the central agent. . The iterative planning process allows "parallel processing" of information by divisions, which is presumed to reduce the time-cost of planning. . The motivational aspects of greater divisional participation in planning and discretionary decision making by divisions may lead to a more thorough search of relevant alternatives and a deeper commitment to the final decision. . The evaluation of performance for individual divisions is enhanced when the overall organizational goal is partitioned by the planning process into sub-goals assignable to a division. * In real decentralized organizations it is commonplace not to attempt centralized solution but to rely on ad hoc decentralized planning procedures, such as budgeting or transfer pricing, to effect resource allocation. This last reason is perhaps the most compelling argument in support of decomposi- tion theory for it subsumes the relevance of the others and provides some objective justification for the formalization. In other words, a forceful argument in defense of theoretical development efforts in this area is that such normative modeling is to a degree descriptive of how resource allocation actually occurs in decentralized organi- zations. Although most theoretical work in organizational design has been focused upon algorithm development (see Burton and Obel [4], Ruefli [31] and Jennergren [16] for critical reviews), the majority of writers have ultimately justified their modeling I Ruefli [27] refers to models incorporating this feature as classical planning models, as opposed to behavioral planning models in which alternative formalizations yield different solutions.</page><page sequence="3">ALTERNATE INFORMATION STRUCTURES IN DECOMPOSED ORGANIZATION 487 approach upon behavioral grounds, i.e., their approach captures some tenet of observable organizational behavior. In particular, the study of decentralized resource allocation, via alternative decompositions, has appeared in a variety of descriptive contexts e.g., national planning (Arrow and Hurwicz [1], Hurwicz [14], Heal [13], Kornai and Liptak [21], Kornai [19], Malinvaud [27]), transfer pricing (Baumol and Fabian [3], Burton et al. [5], Jennergren [15], [16]), capital budgeting (Maier and Vander Weide [26]), and budgeting (Atkins [2], Burton et al. [5], Freeland and Moore [11], Krouse [22], tenKate [34]). Furthermore, it appears that these various decomposi- tion models also have certain normative potential of value in developing formal theories on the design of management information systems (MIS) in organizations, Obel [30]. That is, these models normatively address issues such as the nature of information flows, distributed computation, managerial decision making, incentives, economics of information, and bureaucratic procedures, as components in the or- ganizational design process, all of which are directly relevant to, the design of MIS. Unfortunately researchers in organizational design are now suffering from an "embarrassment of riches" with respect to the decomposition paradigm. Despite the attractiveness of the models' descriptive and normative features to various disciplines, there are many more models than there are instances in which these models have either been applied for resource allocation and decision making in organizations or utilized for actual organizational design (Burton and Obel [4], Ruefli [31]). There are at least three reasons for this "failure of implementation." First, traditional organiza- tional design models, based upon decomposition, are highly abstract representations of reality and ignore vital aspects of organizational design considerations in real organizations, such as the effects of uncertainty, risk sharing, time, and informal (as opposed to formal) communication. Secondly, researchers themselves have been primarily interested in the development of decomposition algorithms and until re- cently have been only peripherally interested in examining these algorithms from an organizational, as opposed to resource allocative, perspective. Finally, the resource allocation process itself in decentralized organizations appears to be a satisficing process (Mintzberg [28], Simon [32]), while most theoretical models of organizational design can speak to the models' performance only at optimality and can say little about performance otherwise. Studies addressing some of the implementational issues have recently begun to appear. Simulations of algorithm performance short of optimality and incentive compatibility effects have been performed by Jennergren and Muller [18] and Madsen [25]. Ljung and Selmer [23] and Christensen and Obel [6] have utilized real data from organizations to assess algorithm performance, initiation, and convergence under several decompositions of linear programs in order to evaluate alternative organizational designs. In contrast, the emerging empirical research in economics of information and MIS (e.g., MacCrimmon [24], Dickson et al. [9]) suggests that cognitive information processing limitations of managers must also be a consideration, if the implementation of resource allocation procedures, based upon decomposition models, is to be advanced. That is, if one views these procedures as models for the resource allocation process in organizations rather than as mechanisms to be rotely applied, then these implementational considerations must be incorporated along with the models into any more-encompassing normative theory of organiza- tional design. Kornai [19] presents an extended discussion of this issue.2 In an attempt 2 In addressing this issue Ruefli [31] astutely points out: . . . that it does little good to abstract a problem from a decentralized organization, solve it using a (decomposition) algorithm, and then attempt to implement the solution. The net effect of that is to centralize the decision process. If these algorithms are ever to be instituted in organizations they must be embedded into the decision process in 'real-time' and that means they must conform to certain organizational characteristics."</page><page sequence="4">488 JEFFREY H. MOORE to address these issues this paper reports on a research effort to examine alternative organizational designs based in theory upon decomposition, and their effect upon the decision making behavior of human subjects. Since it is not practical to experimentally manipulate organizational designs in real organizations to examine the interaction between design, human information process- ing and decision making, a series of controlled experiments involving human subjects were conducted in a simulated decentralized organization. The goal was to structure an organization exactly modelable by several decomposition designs and to experi- mentally evaluate the impact of these designs upon the decision making of subject managers. The research concentrated on the two polar extremes of decentralized resource allocation commonly found in the organizational design literature: price- direction in which transfer pricing is used by a central agent to coordinate resource allocation, and resource-direction in which rationing is used to effect coordination. 2. Framework for Analysis To facilitate the development of the experimental design the following mathemati- cal model will be used to define the organizational structure. Problem P. Find activity levels Xk (k = 1, .. . , n) in order to n maximize CkXk (1) k=1 n subject to: E BkXk b (2) k=1 AkXk dk for k =1, . . ., n, (3) X k &gt;0 where the vectors (Ck, Xk, b, dk) and matrices (Bk, Ak) have suitable dimensions. The model is meant to represent an organization with n divisions and a vector, b, of global resources. The objective function is to maximize the sum of the contributions from the divisions. The set of constraints in (2) represent the global or organization- wide restrictions on the availability of resources whereas (3) represents constraints unique to the divisions of the organization. By assumption there is no uncertainty attached to any parameters of P; however, various agents in the organization may be |' xi |c2x2 0 0 0 * ?n xnj OBJECTIVE FUNCTION B1x1 B2X2 . . .

Although P is normally solved via a sequence of information interchanges which take place over time, time is not explicitly incorporated in the decompositions of P. The structure of problem P can be represented schematically as in Figure 1. The two forms of decomposition of P to be studied experimentally will be called price-directive and resource-directive. In price-directive decomposition the central agent associates a price vector, A, with the global resources and each division solves: Problem Pk (A) maximize (ck - 'Bk )'xk s. t. Akxk =dk Xk &gt; 0 It is well known (Baumol and Fabian [3]) that in general there exists no price vector which allows the divisional problems to identify the optimum of P. Various schemes exist to circumvent this, all of which require the central agent to abandon price setting after sufficient data has been collected on resource demands for various price vectors. A special iteration is then conducted in which the central agent in effect instructs the divisions on the optimal plan. In the experimental design reported here the central agent announces final global resource allocations to each division. It can easily be shown (Jennergren [17]) that given the appropriate allocations the subunits can solve a resource-directive problem, described below, to identify their portion of P's optimal solution. The purpose of the price related iterations, in which the central agent announces prices, divisions solve Pk(A), and communicate global resource demands and payoffs, is for the central agent to collect sufficient aggregate information to make the appropriate allocations in the final iteration. Resource-directive approaches partition the amount of global resources b, into n parts so that Enk= bk &lt; b. Division k then solves the following problem: Problem Rk (hk) maximize C'kXk s . t . Bkxk b(4) Akxk = dk Xk &gt; 0. It should be clear that if Problem P has an optimal solution, then there exists bk for k= 1, ... , n so that the optimal solution for Problem Rk (bk) is optimal in Problem P. Resource directive schemes have the advantage of not requiring a special iteration to effect an optimal solution to P. However, in general they require greater com- munication between the central agent and divisions. At each iteration the central agent must send to each division an allocation of each global resource and receive from each division a vector of "bid prices" which reflect the change in payoff to the division for a small increase in its allocation. Formally these bids are the components of the shadow price vector of each division's problem corresponding to the global allocation constraints (4) in Rk(bk). As algorithms exist for solution of the price-directive decomposition (for example, Dantzig and Wolfe [7], [8]) and for solution of the resource-directive decomposition (for example, tenKate [33], [34]) and ignoring comparative efficiency considerations about which little is known, a perfectly rational central agent would be indifferent between these two schemes. That is, they both can be shown to solve problem P. However, the schemes impose radically different communication and information</page><page sequence="6">490 JEFFREY H. MOORE structures upon the central agent. It would appear that a human central agent would have to conceptualize the allocation problem differently under each of these schemes, even when the underlying organization (number of divisions, technical and profit coefficients, etc.) is unchanged. It may be that a human decision maker is better mentally equipped to cope with cognitive information processing under one scheme than the other. If so, then from an implementational standpoint one decomposition paradigm may be preferable over the other as a normative model for resource allocation in decentralized organizations. The hypotheses to be tested are: HI Subjects, as central coordinating agents, will perform better, using organiza- tional payoff as criterion, under a resource-directive organizational design than under a price-directive organizational design. H2 Subjects, as central agents in both resource-directive and price-directive de- signs, will perform better under low decision time-pressure than under high decision time-pressure. H3 Subjects, as central agents, will perform better than the decomposition algorithm in both price-directive and resource-directive designs in early iterations, while the reverse will be true for later iterations. The rationale for HI was several-fold: (1) Each iteration in the resource-directive design produces a feasible solution to P, if the divisional problems are feasible, while this is not in general true for price-directive designs. This primal feasibility (Geoffrion [12]) property of resource-directive decompositions has been widely reported (Free- land and Moore [11], Jennergren [17], Burton et al. [5]) as an important and useful property of resource directive designs. The occurrence of infeasible solutions of P under price-directive designs is postulated to cause cognitive dissonance in subjects, impairing their performance. (2) The need for a special iteration with its attendant complexity is avoided in resource-directive designs. (3) The central agent can "hold one or more divisions constant" for several iterations by not changing their alloca- tions, thereby concentrating attention on the remaining divisions. This allows some task simplification during the iterative process. (4) When re-allocating global re- sources in resource-directive designs, high individual bid prices from some divisions (as opposed to an aggregate demand in price-directive designs) may serve as indica- tors of which divisions require the most allocational changes. The rationale for H2 was that subjects would be faced with decision tasks of substantial complexity, requiring significant decision-making times. Finally regarding H3, it was postulated that the decision heuristics of humans would produce reasonable decisions early-on, while it is known (Kornai and Liptak [21], Christensen and Obel [6]) that, depending upon its initiation, a decomposition algorithm emits radical and often poor decisions in early iterations. 3. Overview of the Experimental Setting The experimental task consisted of a hypothetical organization exactly modelable by alternate linear programming decompositional designs. In particular the experiment was a single period planning model, involving no evaluation of actual results over time, and consisted of only two organizational levels, a central coordinating agent and three subordinate divisions. Subjects participating in the experiment comprised a convenience sample of students at a large public university and to minimize subject confusion the scenario chosen for the organization was based upon a university planning model. The task faced by subjects was to develop the annual operating budget for a hypothetical university. The university consisted of the president's office and three subordinate colleges, each operated by a college dean. There were four variables for each college: full time equivalent number of undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, and staff. Each college received a per student gross margin, defined as tuition net of direct student related expenses. Each college had constraints on the maximum number of students, faculty and staff. Finally</page><page sequence="7">ALTERNATE INFORMATION STRUCTURES IN DECOMPOSED ORGANIZATION 491 quality-of-education goals, defined by student-faculty ratios, were present for each college as blending constraints. The president's office was charged with maximization of aggregate dollar contribution from the colleges, subject to two global constraints. The first constraint reflected overall space limitation, and used the assignable square foot as a surrogate measure. The second constraint reflected an accreditation requirement that the overall student-faculty ratio for the university be below a predetermined number. In the price-directed scheme prices for assignable square feet and a student-faculty surcharge were the variables under the control of the president. In the resource-directed scheme the president assigned to each college its square footage allocation and a student-faculty ratio designation which was re-expressed in the usual blending constraint format. Given prices or allocations by the president, colleges revised their original plans and responded with new proposals to the president, initiating the start of a new iteration in the planning cycle. The experiment was implemented in the Behavioral Sciences Laboratory of the Center for Research in Management Science at the University of California, Berkeley. The laboratory contains a unique time- shared computer system specifically created for implementing experiments in the behavioral sciences. The computer system, combined with the use of soundproof cubicles in the laboratory, permitted the experiment to be designed as a collection of computer programs, and this permitted careful control over the execution of the experiment itself. For purposes of maintaining additional experimental control, each of the three college deans was replaced by a computerized robot model, whose behavior was that specified by the alternative decompositional schemes discussed in the previous section. That is, each of the college deans behaved precisely as suggested by these alternative designs for resource allocation. A pilot test was conducted to test the credibility of the robots and an elementary form of Turing's test was used to measure credibility. Subjects in the pilot study were unable consistently to distinguish robot proposals from those of human subordinates. During the actual experiment, subjects were brought into the laboratory in groups of four and given a written scenario describing the organizational problem and the decision task faced by each of the four agents in the organization. They were told that assignment of tasks would be made once the decision exercise began.3 After each subject was isolated in a soundproof cubicle, containing a computer terminal, each subject was informed that he had been assigned the role of the president of the university. That is, different replications of the experiment, each with its own robots, were run simultaneously so that in fact there was no interaction among subjects. For ethical reasons the subjects were informed, however, that they might be communicating with a computer model. To guard against possible contamination of the results from the use of robot models, protocols were recorded for a sample of subjects and it was verified that, whether or not they believed they were interacting with a computer, they treated their subordinates as anthropomorphic. Finally, a replication of the experiment was made in which all pretense of deception was dropped to measure the effect of this factor on the results. The replication also allowed testing of other situational factors, such as sample bias, situational effects, differences in briefing and the like. The well known "bang-bang" behavior of linear models was minimized by approximating a nonlinear model by breaking down enrollments into subclasses. Each subclass had slightly different revenue and space consumption parameters so that nonlinear relationships could be approximated by piecewise linear functions. Although the coordination problem presented to a subject was not large by linear programming standards-41 constraints and 87 variables, including auxiliaries-the task faced by a subject was observed to be quite challenging and required that he not only understand the task, but develop information and decision-making heuristics for processing and responding to the proposals submitted by the subordinate colleges. The decision exercise was designed to take approximately 60 minutes, exclusive of briefing and debriefing. Although subjects perceived the decision-making task to be inherently interesting, to further motivate performance subjects received a payment in direct proportion to their performance on the exercise; actual payments averaged from $4.60 to $5.30 for a subject's participation. The scenario given to subjects indicated that the organization was just coming into being so that there was no history of previous plans to be considered. This avoided the problem of incorporating historical outcomes into the decomposi- tion model. Furthermore there were no "pass-through" constraints from one college to another; the only interaction among colleges was through the global resource constraints. The number of iterations was not announced to subjects until two iterations before termination. Except for time pressure considerations, subjects were deliberately allowed to be self-paced in decision making. The actual number of iterations completed varied, therefore, across subjects and ranged from 8 to 23. 3 The experiment was always called a "decision exercise" to avoid contaminating subject behavior. Other loose synonyms were also always used to avoid possible contamination effects: "decentralization" instead of "decomposition," "transfer-pricing" instead of "price-directive," "budgeting" instead of "resource- directive." These terms are consistent with popular usage of the concepts involved and less confusing than the more precise jargon of organizational design.</page><page sequence="8">492 JEFFREY H. MOORE Subjects in both organizational designs saw identical reports, except that resource-directive subjects also saw the appropriate shadow price vectors. An example of a report seen by a resource-directive subject is presented in Table 1. Furthermore, subjects were initiated identically: the zero-th plan was produced by zero resource prices (price-direction) or by infinite resource supply (resource-direction). Termination was effected by having resource-directive subjects select the best feasible plan produced and by having price-directive subjects perform a final resource-directive allocation.

Experimental Design and Results The experimental design consisted of a mixed effects 2 X 2 x 2 factorial design in which the main experimental treatments were the two organizational designs. In addition two treatments, involving different levels of decision time pressure, were also incorporated into the experimental series to test the second hypothesis. Low time pressure meant the subjects had a maximum of five minutes to make a decision in each iteration. The high time pressure treatment started each subject with four minutes maximum decision time and reduced it by 20 seconds in each iteration until a minimum of two minutes. Finally each cell in the 2 x 2 design was replicated once on different days or times and with or without deception to measure possible situational variations. There were no repeated measures. Twenty-eight students served as subjects randomly selected from a pool of applicants. None of the subjects had formal training in decomposition theory; some had been exposed to linear programming. Logistical reasons prohibited equal numbers of subjects per cell in the design. After dropping one factor (see below), the number of subjects per cell ranged from four to eight. Three subjects were dropped from the experiment: one asked to be excused; two were dropped unavoidably because of a computer malfunction. Data analysis was via three-way Analysis of Variance with overall contribution of the final proposal for each subject as criterion variable. Results of this analysis indicated, as expected, no significant effect (p &lt; 0.99) due to the replication factor, either as a main effect or with any two-way or three-way interaction. For convenience this factor was, therefore, dropped yielding two-way ANOVA as the statistical tool for hypothesis testing. The organizational-design treatment was highly significant (p &lt; 0.0009) while the time-pressure treatment was also significant (p &lt; 0.04). There was, however, no significance to the interaction of the two effects (p &gt; 0.92). Friedman nonparametric two-way ANOVA was performed to examine the effect of nonnormal- ity in the data distributions. The treatment effects from this test were also highly</page><page sequence="9">ALTERNATE INFORMATION STRUCTURES IN DECOMPOSED ORGANIZATION 493 significant (p &lt; 0.0000). Unavoidable nonorthogonality in the design usually invali- dates ANOVA analysis. General-linear-model analysis was also performed, utilizing indicator variables, to correct for nonorthogonality. This resulted in only minor changes in the statistics, however, and no change in the significance levels. The general linear model yielded adjusted Beta weights of 0.64 for the decomposition treatment and 0.32 for the time-pressure treatment with a multiple r of 0.78, explain- ing just over 60% of the variance. The experimental model clearly explained a substantial proportion of subject responses. Table 2 presents the results of interest. The criterion used was the contribution of the final, special iteration for the price-directive subjects, averaged over the subjects in a given cell of the design. For resource-directive subjects, it was the contribution of the best feasible proposal, again averaged over the subjects in a given cell. As can be seen, the major hypotheses (H1, H2) of this study are refuted with price-directive subjects uniformly outperforming resource-directive subjects across all cells in the design. It was observed that price-directive subjects quickly developed good heuristics in processing proposals from subordinates and learned quickly to concentrate only on excess aggregate demand. Furthermore, the special iteration of price-direction did not prove to be as confusing to the subjects as originally believed. On the other hand, resource-directive subjects suffered from the dysfunctional aspects of formulating individualized messages to each subordinate and, apparently, could not develop good heuristics for deciding upon resource reallocations in each iteration. TABLE 2 Average Contribution of Final Proposal (Optimal solution of the problem yields a contribution of 478.6) Mean Standard Contribution (000s) Deviation N Treatment: Price-directive 453.5 23.6 11 Time: Low Pressure 437.7 35.3 4 High Pressure 462.6 6.8 7 Treatment: Resource-directive 395.9 33.6 14 Time: Low Pressure 384.3 31.6 8 High Pressure 411.4 32.2 6 Note that under resource-direction the obvious strategy of reallocating to equalize the shadow prices is not necessarily a good tactic (Freeland and Moore [11]). Evidence supporting these contentions is as follows. As a group, resource-directive subjects had great difficulty understanding and interpreting the "bid" prices and formulating messages based upon the proposals from subordinates. Seventeen re- quests for assistance in this matter were registered by the resource-directive group compared to only four requests for clarification by the price-directive group. In addition, the average time spent clarifying the decision exercise to resource-directive subjects requesting assistance was 124 seconds compared to 58.7 seconds for answer- ing questions raised by price-directive subjects. Finally, average decision time between iterations for price-directive subjects was 83 seconds under the low time pressure and 64 seconds under high time pressure. In contrast, the resource-directive subjects required an average of 252 and 164 seconds, respectively. Impressionistic evidence gathered from subject debriefing further confirmed the observation that resource- directive subjects have difficulty forming information processing heuristics. The performance of subjects with linear programming background did not statistically differ from the others.</page><page sequence="10">494 JEFFREY H. MOORE Equally surprising is the effect of time pressure on subject performance in both resource-directive and price-directive designs. Analysis indicates that high time pres- sure has a favorable impact upon performance, rather than the contrary as hypothe- sized. The reasons for this also became clear during the course of the experiment. Subjects were relatively comfortable with the notion of analyzing proposals for purposes of decision-making, but the meta-decision-making strategy of stopping information processing so as to acquire additional information by initiating a new iteration was clearly not a component in subjects' decision-making strategy. The effect of high time pressure was to force subjects to cease information processing and commit to a decision, initiating another iteration, sooner than they would otherwise have done. This in turn allowed more iterations in the available time and a more thorough search of the constraint space. Another unforeseen outcome of the experiment was the impact of primal infeasibil- ity upon price-directive subjects. It can be argued that the experimental design favored resource-directive subjects, since primal feasibility was assured in every iteration. Furthermore, it was postulated that primal feasibility is a key attribute favoring resource-directive organizational designs.

If one defines "satisficing" operationally (and debatably) as repeated decision-making in which suboptimal payoffs improve at a decreasing rate, then resource-directive subjects engaged in apparent satisficing behavior to a greater extent than price-directive subjects. Some indication of this is given in Figures 2 and 3, portraying organizational payoff as a function of the number of iterations for representative subjects in the experiment. The indicated infeasibilities occur when the aggregate of the subordinate proposals violates a global constraint. Notice that price-directive subjects tended to set prices below the optimum yielding a high percentage of infeasible plans. In contrast, resource-directive subjects exhibit very high rates of improvement in organi- zational payoff in early iterations, followed quickly by "dithering" behavior in which further improvement in payoff occurred slowly, if at all. Hypothesis 3 was conditionally confirmed by the experiment. Application of the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition procedure to this problem yielded high negative payoff for the zero-th and first two iterations. The performance of the Dantzig-Wolfe algorithm for subsequent iterations is indicated in Figure 4. Also presented in Figure 4 is the average of all the resource-directive subjects for each iteration, and on the average they performed better than or approximately equal to the algorithm for the first three iterations. In subsequent iterations the non-optimal informational process- ing of subjects accounts for the superior performance of the decomposition algorithm. It should be noted, however, that performance of the algorithm is quite sensitive to its initiation and alternative starting conditions for the algorithm could alter these results. A similar graph of globally feasible performance for price-directive subjects is not possible, because of primal infeasibility and the need for the special iteration. This also precluded comparative analysis after only a few iterations.4 500 375 U_~ 1. 0 250 - 125 - FEASIBLE --- DANTZIG-WOLFE OC I I I 0 5 10 15 20 ITERATION FIGURE 4.

Discussion It is a characteristic of experimentally based research, where causal relations can be inferred, that often more questions are raised than answered. Clearly the external validity of this research is open to debate; the resolution of such issues can only be effected by additional research. Mindful of this and the limited scope 4Relative subject performance after only a very few iterations is certainly of major interest. However, serious methodological issues relating to subject learning and task initiation must first be carefully considered.</page><page sequence="12">496 JEFFREY H. MOORE of experimental research in this area, some conclusions can, nevertheless, be drawn. The conclusions are, of course, tentative and subject to verification. * In settings similar to this, price-directive decision makers have little difficulty adopting workable heuristics for information processing and adjusting to the demands of the required special iteration, if it is implemented as a resource-directive iteration. * Resource-directive decision makers in this setting do well in early iterations (63% of optimum by the second iteration), but improve upon their performance slowly. It is an open question as to how well price-directive decision makers perform in early iterations, because of the special termination condition. * Resource-directive decision makers in this setting have difficulty internalizing the "bidding" concept of resource-direction in order to form information processing heuristics, at least as contrasted with price-directive decision makers. * Price-directive decision makers are stimulated to initiate additional search and information acquisi- tion by primal infeasibility. * Resource-directive decision makers have the advantage of primal feasibility, which allows early termination without special procedures, but primal feasibility provides lowered stimulus to acquire addi- tional information. * A decision to cease information processing and acquire additional information (a variant of optimal stopping in OR parlance) appears to be foreign to the heuristics that decision makers utilize for resource allocation decisions in settings similar to this. Increased time pressure, as a structural attribute of the organizational design, forces information acquisition by terminating the processing of the current proposals to initiate a new iteration. The converse, namely that very high time pressure would encourage excessive information acquisition before final decision making, has not been studied. * The performance of decision makers in early iterations under resource-direction suggests that decision support technology, involving a hybrid of man-machine procedures, could profitably be utilized: a few early planning iterations conducted manually and utilizing historical information with decision-making heuristics, followed by "fine tuning" via a decomposition procedure. This evidence supports earlier recommendations by Kornai [20]. Aside from the need to explore further the propositions proposed above, additional research is needed to examine the case of multiple interacting decision makers (no robots). In particular, this would allow the important area of cheating strategies and the impact of incentive compatible organizational designs to be addressed. It remains to be seen whether the unexpected superior performance of price-directive organizational designs over resource-directive organizational designs will generalize to settings other than experimentally examined here. It is postulated that a contingency theory of organizational design will need to be developed and validated before categorical generalizations regarding the interactions of organizational design, deci- sion environment, and managerial performance can be made. Such a theory would need to incorporate the considerable body of theory and field research found elsewhere in the behavioral sciences, a survey of which is given by Moore [29]. In this regard an interesting and illuminating example of how theory development and experimental research can influence the design of an actual hybrid decentralized price-directive procedure is given by Ferejohn and Noll [10].5 Despite the absence of a comprehensive theory, the value of experimental research such as reported here, in contributing to our knowledge of organizational design, should not be underestimated. It offers a vehicle for addressing the human factors and other implementational problems missing from the plethora of irreconcilable abstract models that characterize the discipline.6 7 5 Their study concerns the actual use of a decentralized price-directive procedure by the Public Broadcasting Service to allocate and budget public television programs. Planning iterations are carried out between headquarters and 150 station managers, via a computer network similar to that employed in this research. 6This research was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation, SOC-7508177 and by a grant from the Spencer Foundation. 7The author wishes to acknowledge helpful comments from L.
