<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Hellenic Studies 119 (1999) pp 128-41 EURYMEDON AND THE EVOLUTION OF POLITICAL PERSONIFICATIONS IN THE EARLY CLASSICAL PERIOD* IN the 460s BC an unnamed artist painted an unusual oinochoe with a unique scene-a Greek chasing an Oriental archer-that marks an important stage in the development of symbolic imagery in the arts of early Classical Greece.1 This oinochoe of unusual shape (PLATE 8a-b), now in Hamburg, was first published by Konrad Schauenburg.2 On side A, a bearded Greek hunter, running v-view to the right, clutches his phallos in his right hand and reaches his left arm toward an Oriental archer, on side B. The archer stands )-view to the right, bent at the hips, with his upper body in a rare frontal pose, and his hands raised to his head. A curious inscription fills the space between te two characters. Two equally plausible restorations of the inscription, each of which carries its own divergent interpretation of the images, have emerged: the original publication by Schauenburg and a response by Gloria Pinney. The inscription that runs between the two characters was restored by Schauenburg as ?pvi)g160ov et{[t] Ki)p[48?] SaorOa 'I am Eurymedon. I stand bent forward', which he took to be the words of the bent figure on side B.3 On the basis of this restoration, Schauenburg and others have interpreted the vase as anti-Persian-a patriotic reminder of the Athenian victory over the Persians at the river Eurymedon in 466.4 This interpretation has been challenged by Gloria Pinney, who perceived that the first two words belong to the Greek man on side A. Pinney favoured a sexual, rather than political, interpretation, rejecting the association of the vase with the Battle of the Eurymedon.5 According to her restoration, the Scythian 'squire', saying Kp6[6a(x] E?c?Ka 'I am the bendover', waits to receive gratification from the cnd er waricature ofo the epic hero, Eurymedon, who identifies himself by saying evpuL(6OV etL[t].6 As the Eurymedon Vase is unparalleled in Attic iconography, neither of these well-reasoned interpretations can be disproven. Yet a compromise interpretation is equally possible: certainly in Classical Athenian * This article is derived from a chapter of my Ph.D. dissertation, 'Political Personifications in Classical Athenian Art', submitted to Yale University in 1997, which was conducted under the supervision of J.J. Pollitt. I am indebted to Professor Pollitt, as well as to Brian Fuchs, H.A. Shapiro, and three anonymous JHS referees, all of whom carefully read and critiqued earlier drafts of this article.

(In the ensuing discussion I take as political anything that influences or comments on the internal or external affairs of a city state, what the ancient Greeks referred to as t6 Tfl; 76XE?o0.7) While the present article attempts such a compromise, it examines the vase from a different perspective: the stage it marks in the development of personification in Athenian visual arts. Before I discuss the iconography of the Eurymedon Vase and the cultural context in which it was produced, a summary of the evolution of personifications in the visual arts of Archaic and early Classical Athens is warranted. It is in the early Classical period that the symbolic use of humanized characters in non-mythological but meaningful contexts began to appear. Such symbolic characters included-but were not restricted to-personifications, which I define as representations of things, places, events, or abstract ideas, by the human form. Personifications had been well known to Archaic Greek artists. Pausanias notes some personifications on the early Archaic 'Chest of Kypselos', the earliest work of Greek art (now lost) known to have been decorated with labelled personifications: Thanatos (Death) and Hypnos (Sleep), with their mother Nyx (Night), as well as Dike (Justice) and Adikia (Injustice).8 Archaic vases are adorned with some of the same characters, but few other personifications are identified by labels in this period: Geras (Old Age),9 Harmonia (Harmony),10 Himeros (Desire),1' Peitho (Persuasion),12 and Themis (Law),13 can be added to those that first appeared on the Chest of Kypselos.'4 Although abstractions of ideas with political connotations are among the personifications found in Archaic art (Eris, Harmonia, Peitho, and Themis), they were largely confined to traditional mythological scenes during that period and were rarely shown in political contexts 7 In Prot. 318e Plato uses this expression to contrast the affairs of the city with those of the home. Plato seeks a similar contrast in Ap. 20b, where Socrates asks Tt; TfSl Toaf6'vT; cpeT?fl;, tf1; stv0peotv- i; T'? Kicat noXIttcfl;, ?tntTn'fgtov tritv; 'Is there someone knowledgeable in both human and civic virtue?' 8 Paus. 5.18.1-2.

Shapiro (n.10) 257 no. 116 suggests that Oknos may also be present on an unlabelled black-figure lekythos (500-490) in Palermo, Museo Archeologico 996. Other non-Attic art works, particularly coins, of course, illustrate personifications, but these are all Classical or later.</page><page sequence="3">AMY C. SMITH before the Classical period.'5 An exception is the politically suggestive scene of beautiful Dike attacking ugly Adikia (Justice triumphing over Injustice), which appears on two Attic vases dating to the end of the sixth century, as well as the Chest of Kypselos.16 In the early Classical period (480-450) artists began to illustrate more personifications in non-mythological scenes, either alone or with other figures. Nike (Victory), already known in the Archaic period,7 became popular on early Classical vases, shown alone or with one other figure.18 The nature of each victory could be revealed through Nike's attributes or actions: she could celebrate a military victory, as when, for example, she erects a trophy, on the name vase (a pelike) of the Trophy Painter.'9 The only new personification in the early Classical period that represents an abstract concept is also a political entity: Anangke (Necessity) may be represented by a winged woman with a torch,20 on an early Classical lekythos in Moscow (PLATE 8c).21 The likelihood that this winged figure was intended to personify Anangke in a political vein is heightened by its importance as a political concept in literature by this time: Herodotos mentions that when the Athenian general Themistokles arrived on the island of Andros he reported that he and the Athenians had come with two gods, Peitho and Anangke, to which the Andrians replied their only gods were Penia (Poverty) and Amechania (Helpless- ness).22 15 It is interesting to note also that three of these 'political ideas' are the only labelled personifications in the Archaic period to appear as participants in standard mythological stories: Harmonia discovered by her future husband, Kadmos; Peitho at the judgment of Paris; and Themis at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. 16 On a fragment of an unattributed black figured eye cup (520-510), Basel, Coll.

Despite Dike's popularity in the literature of fifth century Athens, she never appears in Classical Athenian art. 17 C. Isler-Kerenyi, Nike. Der Typus der laufenden Flugelfrau in archaischer Zeit (Stuttgart 1969). 18 Such representations of Nike are particularly apparent on Nolan amphorae, for which see Beazley's chapter 37 in ARV2. As she appears earlier than most, and is intimately connected with Athena in Classical Athens, but rarely with other political personifications, Nike warrants special attention, which she has now begun to receive.

The label for this character is ANANAH, which is usually interpreted as a misspelling of ANArKH. Although a misspelled inscription is inconclusive, it is likely that a personification was intended, as this winged figure is comparable in form and function to the contemporary images of Nikai; the artist would .have added the label to distinguish Anangke from the more popular Nike. The label (in red dipinti) is sloppily written (as well as misspelled, if Anangke was indeed intended to have been represented); it may even have been a nonsense inscription. On the basis of the inscription, the attribution of this vase to the Providence Painter is unlikely, because that artist generally wrote quite neatly, as also noted by H.R. Immerwahr, Attic Script. A Survey (Oxford 1990) 104. 22 Hdt. 8.111. This may be the first explicitly political use of a personified abstract in Greek literature. A variant story was told by Plutarch (Vit. Them. 21), that the Greek deities were Peitho and Bia (Strength), and that the Andrian deities were Penia and Aporia (Resourcelessness). It is impossible to determine which story was correct, although I am inclined to favour Herodotos, for Bia, a masculine deity, was commonly paired with Kratos in Archaic 130</page><page sequence="4">EURYMEDON AND THE EVOLUTION OF POLITICAL PERSONIFICATIONS 131 Artists in the early Classical period were likewise beginning to express political ideas through other types of figures, such as gods and heroes, and these were sometimes combined with personifications. I shall call these popular heroic and divinized characters in non-mythological contexts 'proto-personifications', for they functioned symbolically, like personifications, although they did not originally serve this purpose.23 These proto-personifications bear their own attributes, but may also serve as each other's attributes. On a calyx krater in New Haven (PLATE 9a),24 for example, Nike and the sea god, Poseidon, refer together to a naval victory. This scene may even refer to a specific military event: according to Herodotos, the Greeks had held Poseidon, along with Boreas, responsible for the storm off Euboea that destroyed much of the Persian fleet in 480.25 To the military subtext may be added a political one: Kimon, the Athenian naval commander (478-463), who arguably shared control of the seas with Poseidon, conducted a campaign to associate himself with Theseus, the quintessential Athenian hero and Poseidon's son.26 As part of this campaign he may have encouraged the representation of Theseus' maritime lineage. Father and son, Poseidon and Theseus, greet each other on the name vase of the Painter of the Yale Oinochoe, where they seem to serve as symbols of post-war democratic Athens: Athens (Theseus) supported by fleet and sea (Poseidon) (PLATE 9b).27 This method of introducing politics into the visual arts, by using recognizable characters, or proto-personifications, as symbols, is the most significant visual precedent for the use of political personifications in the high Classical period. Another area of experimentation among Attic vase painters in the early Classical period was the use of human figures to represent places and other geographical features, local personifica- tions. Local personifications belong to a larger class of geographical entities that began to appear in human form at this time. But geographical entities that seem to have been invented by the artists to represent the places after which they were named, and thus correspond to the definition of personification given above, were still uncommon in the early to high Classical period. Some appear in complex, multifigured scenes, where they primarily indicate the locus art, as noted by Shapiro (n.10) 166-67, 189. Bia and anangke are, however, related concepts, paired in Gorgias' Encomium of Helen: f ytcp TiXlss Poak'eaon wl Kac 0?e6)v pouX?ra Kicat 'Ava6cyil vi otaauoaiv tsepaofv T&amp; tpa?ev, e ptaA SphaOeiroa, 'f e6yot; iTeia0etoa, &lt;Af thpo c on o roaa&gt; (82 B 11.6 DK). 23 J.J.

See Pollitt (n.23) 10. 26 It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss whether Kimon, a well known patron of the arts, directly commissioned vase painters to illustrate Theseus and Poseidon in reference to himself and his accomplishments. Certainly the association of Kimon with Theseus has been well documented elsewhere. For an overview of Kimon's use of Theseus, see H.A. Shapiro, 'Theseus in Kimonian Athens: the iconography of Empire', Mediterranean Historical Review 7 (1992) 29-49. For Kimon's visit, in 474, to Skyros, the legendary burial site of Theseus, to recover the bones of the great hero, as described in Plut. Vit. Thes. 36 and Vit. Cim. 8.5-6, see A.J. Podlecki, 'Cimon, Skyros and "Theseus' Bones"', JHS 91 (1971) 141-43 and, more recently, S. Mills, Theseus, Tragedy and the Athenian Empire (Oxford 1997) 35-36. For Kimon's patronage of the arts see Plut. Vit. Cim. 4; Kimon probably also commissioned the cycle of paintings that decorated the Stoa Poikile, c. 470-460, which prominently illustrated Theseus. These wall paintings, painted by Mikon and Panainos (both of Athens), are mentioned in Paus. 1.15.3, 5.11.6, and Plin. HN 35.57; for modem sources see, most recently, LIMC 6 (1992) 357 s.v. Marathon no. 1 (X. Arapojanni) (with previous bibliography). For political influence on the artists' choices of particular subjects see J. Boardman's series of articles regarding the tyrant Peisistratos and the iconography of Herakles, most recently 'The sixth century potters and painters of Athens and their public', in T.

SMITH of each scene.28 Their appearance in the early Classical period presages the later use of local personifications with overtly political meanings, in conjunction with personifications of abstract political ideas.29 Whether they represent Attic or other topoi, the local personifications in early Classical Athens certainly seem to advertise the importance of Athens to Greece, and the breadth of the Athenian empire. The geographical reference is unmistakable in the earliest instance of a named local personification: Eleusis, the personification of the Athenian site of the Mysteries, occurs on a skyphos attributed to Makron, in London (PLATE 9c).30 Eleusis's primary function is topological: she identifies the place at which the illustrated event-the departure of Triptolemos -took place. But there may also have been a political motivation behind her inclusion. Kevin Clinton has suggested that she mapy have served to advertise the importance of Eleusis, an Athenian deme, as the foremost centre of the worship of Demeter and Persephone.31 This hypothesis receives some support from her appearance slightly later on a red-figure footed dinos attributed to the Syleus Painter, now in Malibu (PLATE 9d), on which she is assembled with the Eleusinian divinities, as well as Hippothon, the eponymous hero of the Attic tribe Hippothontis, and Kalamites, the eponymous hero of the Attic festival Kalamaia (held in the spring at Eleusis).32 The local heroes further emphasize the Attic, and thus Athenian locus of the Mysteries. A distinct class of geographical entities that began to appear in human form in the early Classical period are water deities, particularly Okeanos and his sons, the rivers. Neither Okeanos nor his wife/sister Tethys, the parents of all water spirits, can themselves be considered personifications since the non-mythological sense of each word-ocean, sea-developed from the figure's original mythological role, whereas with true personifications the opposite seems to be the case.33 Yet both characters were used by Classical artists in conjunction with personifica- tions. Okeanos' form changed substantially, from a fishy monster (akin to Nereus) in Archaic 28 See H.A. Shapiro, 'Local personifications in Greek vase painting', in IHpaoKtcc&amp; ro XII AteOvoO; auveSpto) Kacna&lt;ot; apXatkoyta; 1983 B' (Athens 1988) 205-8, for an apolitical treatment of local personifications. 29 The use of overtly political personifications of place and abstract ideas, in the late fifth century and fourth century, on document and votive reliefs and free-standing statues, as well as paintings, is surveyed in A.C. Smith, Political Personifications in Classical Athenian Art (Diss. New Haven 1997) chs. 3-4. 30 C. 490-480. London, British Museum 1873.8-20.375 (cat. no. E 140): ARV2 459.3, 481, 1654; Add2 243. Although Eleusis is a feminine personification here, Panyassis (in Apollod. 1.5.2) called Eleusis the father of Triptolemos (Hyg. Fab. 147; Servius (ad Verg. G. 1.19), however, calls 'him' Eleusinos). For more on Eleusis, see LIMC 3 (1986) 720 s.v. Eleusis (D. Gondicas). 31 K. Clinton, Myth and Cult. The Iconography of the Eleusinian Mysteries (Stockholm 1992) 124. For a broader view of the political significance of Triptolemos, see S.B.

Neither Hippothon nor Kalamites may be regarded as true personifications in this context as their names are related to, but not identical to, the names of the tribe/event that each of them represents. 33 Both Okeanos and Tethys were children of Earth and Heaven (Ge and Ouranos) (Hes. Theog. 136) and parents of the Okeanids and the rivers (Hes. Theog. 337-69; Hom. Il. 14.201). For Okeanos see LIMC 7 (1994) 31-33 s.v. Okeanos (H.A. Cahn). Tethys (Tri0t;) was initially the consort of Okeanos (Hom. Il. 14.201, 302; Hes. Theog. 136, 337), and later came to mean the sea itself: Anth. Pal. 7.214.6; Lycophr. 109; Nonnus, Dion. 31.187; Orph. Argonautica 335. It is difficult to decide whether the plethora of sons and daughters of Okeanos and Tethys, the eponymous heroes and heroines of rivers, fountains, and springs-themselves progenitors of islands and towns-should be regarded as true personifications. Their names are certainly old, and some are mentioned by Hesiod-Neilos, Alpheios, and Strymon, to name a few of the rivers (Hes. Theog. 338-39). Anthropomorphic representations of rivers and springs, whose identities are confirmed by labels, however, function like personifications, and are thus treated as such in this discussion. 132</page><page sequence="6">EURYMEDON AND THE EVOLUTION OF POLITICAL PERSONIFICATIONS 133 art,34 to a man in Classical art. This development may have influenced the decision of other vase painters to represent all manner of local entities as normal human beings: Okeanos' sons, the rivers, also came to be represented as heroic men, rather than as bulls, as in the Archaic period.35 The earliest appearances of a labelled Okeanos in the Classical period are on two vases by Syriskos:36 on the A side of a calyx krater in Malibu, Okeanos is shown with his mother, Ge Panteleia (Entire Earth), and Dionysos.37 He may be represented here as a beardless youth because he is shown with his mother. He is also shown in a family scene, with his sons, anthropomorphic rivers, on Syriskos' pointed amphora in a German private collection (PLATE 10a-b).38 In this case the artist shows that Okeanos belongs to an older generation by portraying him with a beard and white hair (as shown on PLATE 10a). His sons, Strymon, Neilos, and perhaps Skamander and Maeander, witness Herakles' rest in the garden of the Hesperides (PLATE 10b).39 The bearded male figure behind Athena, for whom no label is extant, has been identified as Atlas.40 If this identification is correct, it provides another genealogical connection, for Atlas is the father of the Hesperides and the son of Okeanos.41 His paternal role is emphasized by the fact that he is bearded, although dark-haired in contrast to his father's white hair. Genealogical documentation was possibly Syriskos' primary goal in illustrating the vase with this scene. The grouping of rivers, none of which are close to Attica, but which together indicate the breadth of the known Greek world at the time, also suggests a political theme: Strymon was the largest river of the north, on which later in the century (437/6) Perikles founded Amphipolis; Neilos, to the south, was important because of the Athenian military involvement in Egyptian affairs in the 460s; Skamander and Maeander are important East Greek rivers, in the North (Troas) and South (between Lydia and Caria), respectively. The Hesperides, at the ends of earth, intensify the suggestion of geographical breadth. Perhaps to insinuate the spread of Athenian power, Athena is placed at the centre of the scene, just as Athens was at the centre of the world through which these rivers flowed. Whereas foreigners in Archaic and Classical Athenian art and local personifications in later periods are usually depicted with the marks, clothing, or othenr identifying characteristics of the regions from which they hailed, the rivers on Syriskos' pointed amphora are shown in the same manner as typical Athenian heroes, despite their non-Attic identities. Perhaps this is meant to indicate that they 34 See a black-figure dinos, British Museum 1971.11-1.1 (LIMC 7 (1992) 32 no. 1, pl. 22 (H.A.

SMITH have become absorbed into the realm of Athenian power. The grandchildren of Okeanos and Tethys, whose names are shared by many islands and towns, are also represented in politically suggestive contexts in the arts of early Classical Athens. For example, a skyphos, now said to be in a private collection in Israel (PLATE 10c-d), illustrates and labels Salamis and Thebe, daughters of the river Asopos, with the Eleusinian goddesses.42 On side A Salamis, the eponymous nymph and personification of the island near Athens, faces a female thought to be Kore.43 On side B Salamis' sister, Thebe, retreats from Demeter with a lingering glance and with her arm stretched toward the goddess.44 Karl Schefold and Franz Jung have argued that the artist may have been hinting at a potential rapprochement between Thebes and Athens (representd by Demeter on side B) on the model of the friendly status between Salamis and Athehns (represented by Kore on side A).45 The artist probably chose Demeter and Kore because they were the Athenian deities whose major sanctuary was nearest Salamis, and because their traditional role as the teachers of religion and the art of agriculture to the rest of Greece might also have made them a suitable mythic parallel for the cultural influence of Athens.46 As the popularity of local personifications grew in the early to high Classical period, the symbolic purpose was sometimes combined with or superseded by divine and mythological meaning. Karim Arafat has recently argued for a political justification for the sudden rise (and subsequent fall) in the early Classical period in the popularity of the mythological story of Zeus' rape of Aigina.47 Arafat argues that Zeus pursuing the nymph Aigina represents Athens' attempt to control the nearby island of Aigina, culminating in that island's incorporation into the Delian League in 458.48 Although Arafat does not provide conclusive reasons for the use of Zeus as a cipher for Athens (he argues that Zeus is appropriate to the story because of literary precedence and his legendary role as pursuer), I agree with him that Zeus is not entirely inappropriate.49 The equation of the island Aigina with its eponymous nymph is not only convenient but entirely natural in the realm of ancient thought, so it is more than likely that the vase painters would have recognized the potential appeal of this scene among their customers 42 This vase, painted in a style near the Lewis Painter, is dated to c. 460-450. See LIMC 7 (1994) 652 s.v. Salamis no. 2, pl. 498 (E. Manakidou), 915 s.v. Thebe (c) (C. Vlassopoulou); K. Schefold and F.

Arafat frames his arguments as an answer to John Boardman's query whether this 'otherwise important' scene was popularized by anything political or military: J. Boardman, Athenian Red Figure Vases. The Archaic Period (London 1975) 224. There are more examples of the scene on early Classical vases, but only two are labelled: a column krater attributed to the Boreas Painter (460-450), New York, MMA 96.19.1 (ARV2 536.5; LIMC 1 (1981) 368 s.v.

Figueira, Athens and Aigina in the Age of Imperial Colonization (Baltimore 1991) 115-20. 49 Arafat (n.47) 114-15 argues more convincingly against Alan Shapiro's association of the popularity of this scene with the establishment of the cult of Aiakos, for which see H.A. Shapiro, rev. of K.W. Arafat, Classical Zeus (1990), in AJA 95 (1991) 747-8. As Arafat points out (115), the popularity of this cult does not decline in the middle of the fifth century, when the depiction of Aigina's pursuit ceases to be depicted on Athenian vases. 134</page><page sequence="8">EURYMEDON AND THE EVOLUTION OF POLITICAL PERSONIFICATIONS 135 at a time when Athens was seeking control of Aigina. With the exceptions of Aigina and Amymone,50 no local personifications are used as central characters in mythological scenes. As I have noted in individual cases (Eleusis, Okeanos and his sons, Thebe and Salamis, Aigina), scenes illustrating anthropomorphic representations of geographical entities may have served as subtle reminders of the breadth of Athenian influence. It is not surprising that these images insinuating Athenian power occur at the same time as the Kimonian naval propaganda discussed above; the artists-regardless of the identities of their patrons-were working closely together in Athens, at a time when the demos was excited about the geographic and political domination that Athens was winning through her burgeoning naval prowess. The survey in the preceding pages elucidates three important trends in early Classical art, all of which may be exemplified in the figure of Eurymedon. The first is the experimental use of symbolic figures such as personifications. Second, local personifications and their kin became especially popular, perhaps in response to an enthusiasm for geography inspired by Athens' new internationalism. Third, local and other personifications were used to evoke political messages. Eurymedon certainly exemplifies the first of these trends, and perhaps also the second and third. The Eurymedon River was, after all, the site of Kimon's victory in 466, an important political event nearly contemporary with the date usually assigned to the vase on the basis of its style. It is worth reconsidering the political message of the Eurymedon Vase in light of these early Classical trends. In interpreting the meaning of the Eurymedon Vase one must begin with a determination of which figure is meant to represent Eurymedon and what exactly he is meant to represent. Schauenburg's interpretation of the Oriental archer as Eurymedon is untenable on iconographic grounds:51 Athenian artists would not represent the battle, an Athenian victory, or the nearby river or region that may have consequently came under Athenian control, as a barbarian.52 As the inscription originates just to the right of the head of the bearded man-who is Greek (as is the name Eurymedon)-it is more likely that these first two words of the inscription, ?p)t68ov ?ir[tf] 'I am Eurymedon', are indeed his.53 If the Greek figure identifies himself as 'Eurymedon', in reference to the famous battle of 466, then he serves as a symbol, or representatiion. What exactly does he personify? The eponymous river may be eliminated from consideration as the image of the image of the Greek man does not correspond to contemporary personifications of rivers.54 It seems more likely that he personifies the Battle itself-what most Athenians would have thought of on hearing the name 50 Amymone, the eponymous heroine and nymph of a spring at Lerna, in the Argolid, and a daughter of Danaos had a brief period of popularity in the mid-fifth century, when Attic vase painters depicted Poseidon's pursuit and rape of the heroine: see LIMC 1 (1981) 742-52 s.v. Amymone (E. Simon). 51 Schauenburg (n.2) 103. Schauenburg's interpretation has been reasserted most recently by M.C. Miller, Athens and Persia in the Fifth Century BC. A Study in Cultural Receptivity (Cambridge 1997) 13. In Die unheimliche Klassik der Griechen (Bamberg 1989) 19, T. Holscher accepts Schauenburg's overall interpretation, without specifying which character he takes to be Eurymedon. 52 One might argue that, although neither the river nor the area around it were ever considered Greek, they too came under Greek control as a result of the battle: see Badian (n.4) 4. 53 As suggested by Pinney (n.5). Up to the high Classical period dipinti labelling characters usually originated near the head of the characters, progressing forward if they were on the right side, and retrograde if they were on the left. For a clear example see the Makron skyphos in London (see n.30). For an interesting counter-example, however, see Makron's skyphos in Boston (490-480), on which two of the left-side red dipinti are not retrograde (Peitho on side A, and Kriseis on side B): Museum of Fine Arts 13.186 (ex Spinelli Coll.); ARV2 458.1, 481; Add2 243; Para 377. J. Boardman makes the same observation in 'Kaloi and Other Names on Euphronios' Vases', in M. Cygielman et al. (eds.), Euphronios. Atti del Seminario Internazionale di Studi. Arezzo 27-28 Maggio 1990 (Florence 1992) 45, pl. 56, where he discusses another counter-example: Hypnos, on a cup formerly in the Hunt Collection (LIMC 7 (1994), pl. 520). I thank H.A. Shapiro for bringing this article to my attention. 54 Nor does the image of the archer correspond to the appearance of river personifications. See n.41 and the discussion of Okeanos and his sons on Syriskos' pointed amphora (PLATE lOa-b).</page><page sequence="9">AMY C. SMITH 'Eurymedon'. He is dressed as a hunter, complete with an animal-skin cape-likened to the Thracian zaira by Pinney55-as well as a short beard, or 'goatee'. His lack of underclothing is probably intended to contrast Greek virility with Oriental effeminacy, as it is taken to do with a similar pair of figures on an unattributed calyx krater in Basel (PLATE lla-b).56 For Pinney the goatee suggested Eurymedon's 'barbarian' status, and indeed this unusual beard is another indication that the hunter might be a Thracian.57 Even if one accepts the absence of Thracian weapons-pelte (crescent-shaped shield) and two spears-and the lack of undergarment for contextual reasons, this figure still lacks standard elements of the Thracian wardrobe, the embades (leather-skin boots) and the alopekis (felt cap).58 Similar beards are also worn by hunters on contemporary Greek vases. The arest example is the hunter, perhaps Orion, on the tondo of the Sotades Painter's stemless white-ground kylix in London, who in addition to those features wears a hunter's conical fur hat (PLATE 11C).59 On Attic vases similar attire-conical fur hat and animal-skin cape-is customarily worn by labourers, whether hunters, fishermen, or boatmen.60 And when the labourer is bearded, he often wears a goatee, as in the case of Diktys (?), shown in a three-quarter view on a red-figure lekythos fragment attributed to the Villa Giulia Painter, formerly in the Lullies Collection (PLATE lid).61 Indeed, if he is a personification of the battle, the hunter-iconography perfectly suits Eurymedon. The hunt-battle analogue had long been used in the arts of the Near East; see, for example, the alternating hunt and battle scenes on limestone reliefs from the walls of the palace of Ashurnasirpal II at Nimrud, c. 875 (now in the British Museum). And Judith Barringer has argued for the pervasive use of the hunt-battle analogue in Attic vase painting.62 A hunter is a pursuer, whether in the context of game, sex, or war. As 55 Pinney (n.5) 181. This cape is much more rectangular and schematic than those worn by Thracians found elsewhere in Attic vase painting. See, e.g. A. Lezzi-Hafter, 'Offerings made to measure: two special commissions by the Eretria painter for Apollonia Pontica', in J.H. Oakley, W.D.E. Coulson and 0.

Kilmer, Greek Erotica on Attic Red-Figure Vases (London 1993) 128 takes it to be a sign of youth, in an interpretation that is likewise unsubstantiated. For comparable Thracian beards see Lezzi-Hafter (n.55) figs. 12-18. 58 Pinney (n.5) 182. If one insists on the Thracian origins of this cloak and beard (which I shall not) they could be taken as an allusion to Kimon, who concentrated his efforts on Thrace immediately after the Battle of the Eurymedon. For more on the circumstances surrounding this battle see Badian (n.4) 2-6. 59 London, BM D 7: ARV2 763.3; Add2 286. For this identification of the hunter see A. Griffith, "'What leaf-fringed legend...": A cup by the Sotades painter in London', JHS 106 (1986) 58-70. Alternative interpretations have been made recently by H. Hoffmann, Sotades. Symbols of Immortality on Greek Vases (Oxford 1997) 134-39 (reworked from an earlier article, H. Hoffmann, 'Aletheia. The iconography of death/rebirth in three cups by the Sotades painter', RES 17-18 (1989) 67-88), and L. Burn, 'Honey pots: three white-ground cups by the Sotades painter', AK 38 (1985) 93-105. The traditional interpretation, that the hunter represented Hippomedon, at the death of Opheltes/Archemoros, was made by C.H. Smith in Catalogue of the Greek and Etruscan Vases in the British Museum 3. Vases of the Finest Period (London 1896) 392. 60 It is perhaps worth noting that the pilos-another form of headgear common to labourers-is worn by the Greek battling the Persian on the Basel krater (PLATE l1 la). 61 ARV2 624.77, 1662; AddF 271. This character has been identified as Diktys, the fisherman who found Danae in Aischylos' Diktyoulkoi: H. Luschey, 'Danae auf Seriphos', BABesch 24-26 (1949-51) 28, n.l5. (John Oakley now tells me that he believes this fragment might actually represent another boatman, Charon).

Persian scene on the Basel krater (PLATE 1 la). In each case, as mentioned above, the Greek's manly nakedness (revealed beneath the cape) contrasts with the Persian's full attire. And the Greeks' manly weapons (phallos on the former; hoplite spear on the latter) contrast with the Persian's bow-a cowardly weapon, as it is the weapon that kills from afar.66 The Greek on the Basel krater looks as if he should and will win, as he is the more 'macho' of the two. The same contrast is implicit, even without the military weapons, on the Eurymedon Vase-the archer's quiver and his open-handed gesture emphasize the absence of his bow and his weak position; here the Oriental epitomizes an effeminate warrior unarmed. How does the image of the Oriental archer-Eurymedon's quarry-further the inference that the Greek hunter personifies the Battle of the Eurymedon? First there is a question of identity: is he Persian or Scythian? Schauenburg asserted that he was Persian.67 In her attempt to dissociate this vase from the battle, Pinney argued that he was Scythian.68 As Arafat notes '... there is a case to be made for the identity of the victim either as Skythian or as Persian. It is possible that there is a genuine muddle on e the part of the painter'.69 Wulf Raeck has observed that the costume and appearance of later Archaic Scythians and early Classical Persians are virtually indistinguishable.70 And this archer does clearly resemble the late Archaic image of the Scythian: with the exception of his soft leather, pointed Persian slippers,71 he is dressed like the two Scythian archers on a late Archaic amphora in Munich (FIG. 1).72 One could argue also that the archer's facial features-long nose with prominent bridge, moustache, and pointed beard-distinguish Eurymedon's foe as a genuine Persian.73 This visual conflation of Scythians and Persians is not surprising: although the Persian became the quintessential enemy of Athens after the Battle of Marathon (490), by this tim he Scythian archer had already become a familiar character in the streets of Athens, where he was exploited, and sometimes ridiculed, by 63 Arafat (n.47) 103. 64 For the power of the phallos see C. Reinsberg, Ehe, Hetdrentum und Knabenliebe im Antiken Griechenland (Munich 1989) 177. Davidson (n.5) 169-82 argues convincingly that Athens' phallocratic nature has been overstated, although he admits (170) that the Hamburg oinochoe 'seems to demonstrate unequivocally a connection between penetration and power'. 65 Kilmer (n.57) 107 explains that it is the only clear homosexual example of the use of the penis as a weapon. He compares this scene to that on a cup in Florence by the Antiphon Painter (ARV2 339.54), in which a balding, bearded man prepares to mount a nude woman a tergo: 'his right (hand) grasps his erect phallos as though it were a weapon: the four finger grip is not required for guidance'. 66 M.C.

The archer's posture, hinting at sexual passivity, is also appropriate to the expressed victory. The Oriental archer's arms are held up and forward, in an exaggerated version of the conventional gesture of terror/shock on the part of (female) rape victims.75 His frontal face and torso may also indicate his helplessness.76 Perhaps the exaggeration of the gesture is for dramatic effect.

If read with the preceding observations in mind, the image on this oinochoe is of the hunter, Eurymedon, firmly grasping his weapon, as he prepares for the inevitable attack on his quarry, and subsequent victory.80 The sexual metaphor succeeds on perhaps three levels: it reminds the viewer of the submissive position in which Kimon had put Persia in anticipation of the Battle of the Eurymedon;81 of the immediate outcome of the Battle; and of the consequences of the victory, i.e., that the Athenians then found themselves in a position to rape the Barbarians on the Eastern reaches of the Greek world.82 The painter of the Eurymedon Vase thus may have intended a political reference on a subtler level than that suggested by Schauenburg and Dover: with proto-personifications and personifications, political references were usually inferential. Eurymedon still differs from other personifications in the visual arts in that he is distinguished by the artist's inclusion of the verb, EtiLt, which suggests that he is not just a personification-a human figure representing a noun-but actually a character impersonating Eurymedon. In giving Eurymedon the task of introducing himself, rather than merely labelling him, the painter has effected a sort of visual prosopopoeia, rather than personification. Ilpoaomornotat, 'the putting of speeches into the mouths [faces] of characters',83 is routinely cited as the ancient term nearest in meaning to personification.84 npoonlto7ottta derives from t 7 p6aaosov, face or, in a dramatic context, mask or character. The technique of prosopo- poeia is accordingly best suited to literary performance, whether dramatic or oratorical; it is in an oratorical context that the first surviving use of the term occurs: 'The figure of thought called prosopopoeia can be used with forceful effect...; "Consider that it is your forefathers who are reproaching you and saying such things to you, or Greece, or your own City in the form of a woman..."'.85 According to this explanation, prosopopoeia consists in not merely creating a form, as is the case with personifications in the visual arts, but in giving speech to the resulting personification, an effect that was not generally used by vase painters. The Greek hunter on the Hamburg oinochoe, who boldly proclaims to the audience ?tpullg6ov ttgt, thus seems to be the exceptional case in which prosopopoeia is effected in the visual arts of Athens. 78 While the anticipated sexual act suggested in this context (between males) is anal penetration, one must accept Boardman's note (in J. Boardman, rev. of K. Dover, Greek Homosexuality (London 1978), in JHS 100 (1980) 245) that the a tergo approach in images that depict female passive partners does not necessarily imply anal copulation. Holscher (n.51) 18-20 emphasizes that on early Classical (pre-Periklean) monuments, Persians, as foes of the Greeks, are often shown in pare often shown in particularly humiliating circumstances, unprecedented in Greek art, and that this was an important step in building the collective identity of the Greeks. 79 Kilmer (n.57) 22. 80 Arafat (n.47) 114 has discussed this 'explicit' use of rape as a metaphor for victory in connection with similar implicit uses of the rape metaphor, as in the rape of Aigina (by Zeus) or Oreithyia (by Boreas). 81 See especially Plut. Kim 12.1. 82 Eurymedon's distance from the archer, who symbolizes the (peoples of the) East, could also serve as an ironic comment on Kimon's notorious inaction in the aftermath of the battle. See Badian's summary of the events following the battle: Badian (n.4) 4. 83 LSJ s.v. ipoaomoiodta. 84 The modem Greek equivalent, 7po onot0Otrlat;, refers to artistic, as well as literary personifications. 8 Demetr.

Kennedy, A New History of Classical Rhetoric (Princeton 1994) 88-90.</page><page sequence="13">AMY C. SMITH Eurymedon's introduction of himself, with the words 'I am Eurymedon', may be related to contemporaneous oratorical experiments by authors. The phenomenon prosopopoeia, as described by Demetrios, was not known at this time; the earliest certain example of this trope is the Nomoi (Laws) in Plato's Crito 50c (tentatively dated to the 390s). But it is in the early Classical period that writers first began to endow their personifications with speech. In the 460s, Kratos (Might), accompanied by Bia (Strength), speaks the opening lines of Aischylos' Prometheus Bound, and serves as counsellor to Hephaistos.86 The use of speaking personifica- tions is also related to 'fictive speaking', a technique whereby individuals would deliver imaginary addresses on real or fictive occasions. Gorgias could hardly have delivered his Epitaphios, which contains a praise of the Athenian character, for example, as he was not a citizen.8 And Damon may have presented his theories about music and culture in a similarly illusory setting, an address to the Areopagos.88 In such 'fictive speaking' well-known figures from myth are often made to deliver the speeches, so as to lend authority to the message, even at the expense of historical credibility. Hippias, for example, seems to have couched his review of 'worthwhile careers' in the form of a fictional address of Nestor to Achilles at Troy.89 Euripides practised a slightly more plausible variant of this phenomenon in which the characters are appropriate to the context, yet the content of the speech is dramatically inappropriate: in Suppliants 426-62, for example, Theseus defends the Athenian character in a conversation with a Theban herald who has brought a message concerning another matter.90 In each of these cases a mask is donned in order to convey a message. We cannot determine whether the unknown painter of the Eurymedon Vase was intentionally experimenting in the use of personifications when he brought the speech-making aspect of prosopopoeia, or 'fictive speaking', from the literary arts to the visual arts. The technique was not adopted by other painters and artists, for no other visual personification in Classical Athens is made to announce himself. Perhaps this is because simple labels, such as those which identify personifications and other characters on Archaic and Classical vases, would have sufficed: with his mask of Greek manhood, Eurymedon delivers no lengthy address, and his action speaks for itself. I have two suggestions regarding why the artist gave Eurymedon speech. First, in adding the verb stgt to the noun u?pu.L2i8ov, and thus making the Greek hunter announce himself, the artist is clarifying that the addition of a?pgctl6ov is not nonsense, an inside joke, or a passing political slogan, but that 'Eurymedon' is central to the meaning of the scene, however that might be interpreted. As personifications were not generally used in such an allegorical or didactic manner in the Archaic period this was an important point to make in the early Classical period. Second, the artist may have been inspired by a theatrical performance, either alluding to or copying a lost theatrical scene in which the Battle of the Eurymedon was parodied in the form of a Greek hunter.91 We may then consider the possible relation of this vase to actual theatrical performances.92 86 Aesch. PV 1-88. Kratos and Bia were also paired, as attendants to Zeus in Hes. Theog. 383-85. Kratos appears alone in Aesch. Eum. 244. For Bia paired with Peitho, see n.22. 87 82 B 6 DK. Regarding whether Gorgias' Epitaphios could have corresponded to an actual event, see T. Buchheim, Gorgias von Leontinoi. Reden, Fragmente und Testimonien (Hamburg 1989) 190 n.2. 88 37 B 1-10 DK, esp. B 2. 89 86 A 9 DK. 90 See also the end of the messenger's speech in Eur. Medea 1225-30, where the complaint against intellectuals is irrelevant to the play. 91 Davidson (n.5) 181 suggests that the attribution of the name, Eurymedon, to this figure, might be a literary allusion, as it was the name of several historical and mythological figures. 92 Rusten (n.75) has also discussed this vase in relation to Old Comedy. 140</page><page sequence="14">EURYMEDON AND THE EVOLUTION OF POLITICAL PERSONIFICATIONS 141 Not only does Eurymedon introduce himself as a stage character might, but the archer responds with an awkward, barely intelligible phrase that has been restored as KuPfk[?a;] gcaeKa primarily to make it intelligible to modem scholars. Such barbarized speech was normal for foreign characters in fifth-century plays.93 It is also possible that the goatee worn by Eurymedon is a costume beard, as it is known in Attic images that illustrate theatrical scenes.94 Even if the scene on the Eurymedon Vase did not derive from a theatrical scene, the painter may have been inspired by theatrical performances where-in comedy, at least-sexual humour was commonplace. Despite the unique nature of the Eurymedon Vase, its image-Eurymedon pursuing an Oriental archer-may be placed in the mainstream of Classical vase iconography, because it exemplifies the three major tendencies of vase iconography in this period that ushered in the use of symbolic characters such as personifications to insinuate political meanings. First, the images are restricted to two distinctive figures (one on each side, in this case), who are individually recognizable (one as a Greek hunter, the other as an Oriental archer), but together tell another story. Second, the characters are shown in a non-mythological scene. Third, the humanized figure of Eurymedon, which probably represents the Battle of ich o the Eurymedon itself, primarily indicates a locus for the scene and secondarily intimates the spread of Athenian power, as do Athenian anthropomorphized representations of rivers and ther geographical entities (including local personifications). In adapting such techniques in the use of symbolic figures, early Classical artists began to use their art to express ideas through novel compositions as well as adaptations of the traditional myths. In the evolution of the didactic use of personifications, some early Classical painters experimented in giving proto-personifications as well as personifications meaningful clothing, attributes, and gestures. In the case of the Eurymedon Vase, it seems that one of these transitional painters made a unique experiment: he adopted a theatrical technique, giving his figures speech and giving Eurymedon the chance to introduce himself, perhaps to clarify what exactly these figures were meant to represent. Because of this experiment the Eurymedon Vase may also be placed in the mainstream of contemporary literary experiments.95 AMY C.
