<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LANGUAGE OF TYRANNY IN CRATINUS, PCG 258* A mock theogony from Cratinus' Chirones 1 seems straightforward and uncomplicated evidence of the jibes of the comic poets against Pericles.2 The source for this fragment, Plutarch's Life of Pericles, chapter 3, in fact connects it with the usual sallies of the archaia about the shape of Pericles' head.3 Yet, the fragment equally reflects the presence of contemporary opposition in Periclean Athens against the statesman. Plutarch simply covers the density of its allusion, which is something beyond the comic resource of attacking marked peculiarities of appearance of politically prominent indi- viduals: the Homeric-style hapaxK€$akr'yepeTavA alludes to the deformity of Pericles' head but also to his demagogic ability to assemble the masses5 in the so-called 'language of the gods'.6 Many questions are, however, posed when we attempt to account for the allegories or the analogies the passage establishes. As Hanow7 wondered back in 1830: verum quid Xpóvoç TTpeaßvyevri ç ad Periclem faciat , non reperio; quamquam certam quandam rem a Cratino spectatam arbitror. The main purpose of this paper, therefore, is to examine the fragment afresh, in the hope of showing that the source for the parody of this piece of Cratinus may be traced elsewhere than so far suggested, and that there is good reason for Stasis and Chronus fathering this sinister infant. * A shorter version of this paper was presented at the Annual Meeting of the Classical Association at the University of Edinburgh in April 2002. 1 wish to thank A. Sommerstein and the audience for observations made on that occasion. I owe special thanks to M. Fantuzzi, R. Hunter, and an anonymous referee of the journal for helpful comments and suggestions on the final version of this piece. Translations of quoted texts, if not otherwise specified, are mine. 1 The date of the production of the play is unknown, but a date c. 431/30 has been suggested: see Pieters (1946) 1 12-13; Mattingly (1977a) 241 and Mattingly (1977b) 67; Ameling (1981) 398; Geissler (1925) 20-1. Alternatively, Schwarze (1971) 60-4 suggests a date c. 440, certainly shortly after 443. 2 See Schwarze ( 1 97 1 ) 55-64; Podlecki ( 1 998) 1 69-76. 3 On Pericles' head see Revermann (1997); Cohen (1991); Podlecki (1998) 177-8; also Schwarze (1971) esp. 28-9, 32-3, 59-60, 66-9, 98-99, 133, 183. 4 Cf. the Homeric epithets crrepo'nT|'y6pĆTT|s' ve&lt;1&gt;€'r|YepĆTr|S' which served as Cratinus' models for the epithet.

Of the two emendations, the latter was soon disregarded:8 Tupayyoy is of course appropriate and justified because the comic writers often accused Pericles of aiming at tyranny and of looking like Peisistratus (Plutarch, Per. 7. Iff.), and his friends were branded as 'new Peisistratids'; besides, the one who is born here is Zeus-Pericles, not the incarnation of a mythic Titan (the Titans were sons of Uranus and Gaia, and so brothers of Cronus, not his descendants).9 Much more puzzling is line two:10 if Pericles was to be understood as Zeus, why does Cratinus make Chronus his father? Would not the conjecture Cronus better serve the comedian's parallelism? As noted by Meineke (1839) scilicet Periclem Olympium eodem quo Iuppiter Olympius patre nasci consentaneum erat. 1 1 Of the earlier scholars, Emperius (1847) 12 defended Chronus as the symbol of the good old times in opposition to the new political regime introduced by Zeus-Pericles 8 See however Magnien (1907) 23: 'mais comment douter que TiTdva ne convient mieux dans cette généalogie burlesque, comme fils de ZTàaiç et de Rpóvoç, qu' un mot vague tel que TÚpavvov'? 9 These objections are made by Tammaro (1978-9) 207 n. 25. 10 See for instance how Lucas (1828) 10 encompasses a wide range of alternatives in his interpretation of the line: paulo difficilius est inte rp retari vim vocabuli Xpóuoç, quem Periclis patrem comice statuii Cratinus; significai fartasse Kpóvov, Iovis genitorem, quoniam Pericles in comoedia veteri sub nomine Iovis Olympii vario modo exagitabatur; praeterea poterai comicus noster Periclem ludibrio habere, quippe cum Cunctatoris fìlium eum nominaret et opera suscepta segniter absolventem.

In recent years the mss reading has been defended by Luppe (1963) 220 who argues that we should expect an abstract noun next to the abstract Stasis, that the pair of the two abstracts would mean Pericles' long political struggles before his advent to power, and that Xpóvoç and K6&lt;f&gt;a'r|yepĆTav are a pun for Cronus' son, Zeus ve&lt;/&gt;eXr)yepéTar' Some of his arguments are similar to those of Cobet (1840) 25: nimiam Periclis in civitate libera potentiam tractu temporis e discordia civium genitam sic audaci metaphora pronuntiat who, nonetheless, prints Kpóvoç. Edmonds (1957) 1. 240 prints Kpóvoç but notes: 'or keeping the ms reading Time of ancient date'.</page><page sequence="3">76 MARIA NOUSSIA through a stasis. However, as noticed by Tammaro,13 this association functions better for Cronus, because Cronus is the god connected with the idea of a happy yet remote past: in the tradition he was king when the xpuaeov yevo? lived; besides, in Old Comedy, Cronus is the synonym of the happiness of the good old times.14 Cratinus would have meant that the happy life in the time of old Cronus came to an end when Stasis was united with him15 - the Greek text however does not say this at all. A less coherent explanation is offered by Bona16 in regard to what Cronus' presence means and how the parallelism of Pericles to Zeus works comically: Pericles would be son of Cronus (like Zeus) and of Stasis, both if with the latter we intend a historical hint at the situation in Athens before Pericles' benevolent and peaceable intervention (but then one may wonder why ever label Zeus-Pericles as tyrant), and if the reference is to the divine world, full of conflicts and strife, in which Cronus' reign was set before the advent of Zeus (then Cronus is not a positive agent and there is no contrast between him and the tyrant Zeus-Pericles). Bona further suggests that it must have been a widespread opinion to see recent innovations as corruption which contrasted with Cronus' time, proverbially a simple, rude but honest period (if so, then Cronus becomes a positive element). More recently, for Luiselli17 the parodie and allusive presentation of Kpôvoç as father of Zeus-Pericles would reflect first of all the comedian's critique on the internal elements inside the ideal regime (the xpúcreov yevos4 of Cronus' age) that have permitted its degeneration to the point that they gave birth to an opposite regime (namely the union with Ztcloi? and the creation of Zeus-Pericles).18 Neither Tammaro' s nor Luiselli 's interpretations hold when closely confronted with Hesiod's myth of metals to which they appeal.19 The life of the Golden Age under the 13 Tammaro ( 1 97 8-9) 208 . 14 Yet, on the whole, the character of Kpóvoç was made up of contrasting qualities even in the archaia : cf. Ar. Nub . 929, Av. 468-9 with Dunbar (1995) ad loc. 15 Tammaro (1978-9) 209. 16 Bona (1988) 205. 17 Luiselli (1990) 97. 18 Another possibility for assuming that Cronus is the father of Pericles may seem to be provided by PCG *259 "Hpav Té oi 'Acrn-aaiav tíktéi KaTaTTuyoaúvri I TTaXXaicfiv Kuvwrnba, ('unnatural Lust bore to him Hera- Aspasia the shameless prostitute'), a fragment which contains Aspasia' s mock genealogy, and is commonly attributed to the Chirones. Assuming that oi depends on tí «rei (rather than on TTaXXaicr|v with reference to Pericles), oi should represent Aspasia' s father. In my opinion however it is not prudent to identify Aspasia' s father with Cronus, stretching too much the identification of Aspasia with Hera, KaaLyvT|TTļv dXoxóv Te of Zeus (in Horn. II. 16.432, 18.356; Hymn. Horn. Ven. 40, Hymn. Horn. 12.3). Why need Cratinus here consider Pericles and Aspasia brother and sister, like Zeus and Hera? How would this work comically? According to Edmonds (1957) 1. Ill the identification of oi with Cronus would make the marriage of Pericles and Aspasia incestuous like that of their parallels, Zeus and Hera. But Cratinus instead makes Lewdness Aspasia' s mother and this genealogy is licentious enough either for her or for Pericles. It was not essential to emphasise the fact that they were brother and sister in order to impute the pair with shameful activities. Besides, a derogatory attitude towards Zeus' and Hera's wedding is alien to almost all Greek literature, see e.g. Janko (1992) on II. 16.431-2, and the discussion by Pretagostini (1984) 139^-7 on the use of Zeus' and Hera's wedding in Theoc. Id. 17 as an exemplum which legitimates Ptolemy's and Arsinoé II's wedding. All in all, I think it is not possible to decide the identity of o! in PCG *259; moreover, a reference to Cronus seems to me the least plausible interpretation. 19 As Gomme (1945-81) 1 . 104 n. 4 points out: 'Cronus is not here the god of the Golden Age.'</page><page sequence="4">THE LANGUAGE OF TYRANNY IN CRATINUS, PCG 258 77 rule of Cronus (Hesiod, Op. 109-20) was idle, merry and full of peace and feasting, without war or violence, and, of course, without stasis (11 8ff . oí ó' €0£Xr|ļj.oi I qauxoi £py' 6V6|iovto aw 6a0Xoiaiv TToXécaaiv). More significantly, the Hesiodic Myth of the Five Races gives no explanation of the progressive degradation of mortals: in particular the Golden Race dies out for no assigned cause and before the reign of Zeus (116, 121). The men of the second, or Silver Race (127^12) are not descendants of the Golden Race (129 xpucrécp outc (J&gt;utìv èvaXìyiaov out6 vórifia), but a new creation by the gods on Olympus. They have thus no relationship and no connection with the men of the Golden Race. The disappearance of this race is not explained in Hesiod as a consequence of any decline of its antecedent; the new race is destroyed by Zeus because it ignores the gods (137-9 toùç pèv cttcitci I Zeus* Kpovi8r|9 eKpviļje xoXoújjlcvoç, oweica Tipàç I oük côiôov paicapeaai ©cots' di'OXu|j.TTov cxouaiv); likewise, the third race, the Race of Bronze, is not descended from its predecessors (144 oùk àpyupétp oùSèv dļjLoiov) and it dies out of its own conduct, 'by their own hands' (152) as do the Heroes of the Bronze Age (161-5). Furthermore, as Gomme pointed out,20 while the poets of the Old Comedy 'were fond of giving pictures of a golden age, so different from the miserable present', they gave play to their imagination 'not only by the conventional theory of a long-past age happy because it was simple (the Hesiodic picture), but by memories of a not distant generation'. Indeed the presence of a chorus of Xcíptuvcç (= Centaurs) might in itself have inclined the audience to think of a more distant, mythic time,21 and PCG 256 paKapio? qv ó TTpò toû ßio? ßpoToiaiv I TTpòç Ta vw, òv elxov áv8p69 I àyavó&lt;(&gt;pov69 fiôuXóycoí ao&lt;f&gt;íai I ßpoTcov TTepiaaoKaXXciç ('happy in comparison with the present was the past life which gentle people exceedingly beautiful in their sweet- voiced wisdom were living') suggests a temporally remote utopia.22 Yet, another fragment of the play, PCG 257 ànaXòv 8è aiaupßpiov &lt;f|&gt; póôov f| Kpivov nap' ouę 60aK6i, I p6Ta x^pca $6 prjXov 6KaaToç cxwv aKiTTcova t' qyopaCov ('everyone was sitting with a sprig of soft bergamot-mint, or a rose, or a lily at his ear, or lounged about the market-square with an apple or a staff in his hands') illustrates this utopia:23 this life was probably situated in Themistocles' time or at least, as Ceccarelli24 well remarks, in a society which already knew the agora.25 Part lb: Cratinus and Prometheus Bound 20 Gomme (1945-81) 1. 104. 21 Ceccarelli (1996) 131. 22 Ruffell (2000) 487.

Good discussion of the passages mentioned here in Farioli (2000) 423-4.</page><page sequence="5">78 MARIA NOUSSIA The conjecture Kpóvoç would also illustrate the dramatist's intention of extolling the age of Cronus in contrast to the present state: the glorious political past of the age of Cronus would be contrasted with the age of Zeus-Pericles: Zeus' regime is cruel tyranny whereas that of Cronus' corresponded to a better political reality. This interpretation, which was first suggested by Tammaro and furthered by Luiselli,26 is based on comparison with two passages from Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound which depict the overthrow of Cronus and the Titans and the shift of authority from the Titans to Zeus and the Olympians: 6Trd Táxicrr' qpÇavTO 8ai|iov6ç x^ov crráaiç t' 6 v àXXf)Xoiaiv Gopo0uv6TO, o! |i6 v 06 Xovt 6 ç 6KßaX6iv 68paç K pó voy, ojç Zevç àváaaoi 8f¡06v, oí 8è ToufiTTaXiv &lt;7TT6u8oVT6S' á)Ç ZeVÇ ļlf|TTOT' dp^6l6V 06OJV (199-203) When first the Gods began their angry quarrel, and God matched God in rising faction, some eager to drive old Kronos from his throne that Zeus might rule - the fools! - others again earnest that Zeus might never be their king (tr.

Cf. also Farioli (1996) 97: 'è comunque innegabile la comunanza di personaggi e di argomenti tra i due poeti, e anche di alcune particolari interpretazioni, come ad esempio, significativamente, la rappresentazione del governo di Zeus come tirannide, sviluppata da Eschilo nel Prometeo '</page><page sequence="6">THE LANGUAGE OF TYRANNY IN CRATINUS, PCG 258 79 This is a sickness rooted and inherent in the nature of a tyranny: that he that holds it does not trust his friends. (tr. Grene and Lattimore) Yet the text of Aeschylus presents Zeus' succession to Cronus not as his own act against his father27 but as a solution to a stasis between two opposed factions (201-3), and therefore does not put Zeus' eventual assumption of power in a bad light. The character of Zeus in Prometheus Bound seems to display the traditional attributes of a 'bad tyrant' (222).28 Though the play also contains numerous indications that Zeus' predecessors were also no gentler forces,29 it is of course entirely possible that a comic poet could have represented the Aeschylean Zeus as a tyrant. However, the assumption that Aeschylus allegorically portrays Pericles as Zeus30 is, in Griffith's words,31 uncon- vincing for Aeschylus; so is the attempt to parallel Cratinus to Aeschylus, I would add. Part Ic : Cratinus and Pherecydes of Sy ros Neither can Cratinus' account be informed, in my view, by the cosmic system of Pherecydes of Syros (or other contemporary cosmogonies)32 or by Orphic theogony,33 despite the flavour of the archaic genealogists in the fragment. As far as we can reconstruct Pherecydes' cosmology,34 Eternal Time35 without a consort (F60 = VS A8) produces three elements in an auto-erotic first creation (tòv 8è Xpóvov TToifjaai ék tou yòvov èauTou TTÛp, ktX.): this is a cosmic as well as a theogonical creation, as from the mingling of the three elements several gods are born (ibidem) (è£ ¿y ... ôiriipTpéyojv TToXXf)v áXXr|y yeveàv aucjTfjvai 06 wv). Unlike the auto-erotic first creation, the second creation is specifically sexual, involving Eros in the union of Zas and Chtonie = 27 So Luiselli (1990) 95 'il passo eschileo richiama l'esito di quella lotta intrapresa da Zeus per strappare al padre Kpóuoę il potere'. 28 See Griffith (1983) on 736-7. 29 See Griffith (1983) on 152.

Such evidence provides no basis for arguing that Cratinus would employ here etymological derivations of Cronus = Chronus. 33 For Chronus in Orpheus' Rhapsodies see Brisson ( 1 997) 151 n. 6 who notes that no account of the Orphic Chronus can be found earlier than the second century ad. 34 For the argumentation in this part of the paper I depend heavily on Schibli (1990). 35 Two of the accounts of this theogony (Probus and Hermias) give Kpóuoę but interpret it as 'Time'. See Schibli (1990) 17 n. 9.</page><page sequence="7">80 MARIA NOUSSIA Ge (F68, F73 = B2, All). Furthermore, the roles of Zas and Chronus appear to change gradually and less dramatically: Chronus seems to have been peacefully succeeded by Zeus, and to retire to his sovereignty in Heaven (F82, F83, F2 = B4-5, A2).36 All these differences are too great to let Cratinus' audience establish any direct connection between the comic poet and the cosmology of Pherecydes. On the contrary, such differences do seem to suggest that Cratinus' idea of Xpóvoç as Zeus-Pericles' father was in origin independent of cosmogonies; furthermore the cosmogonie resonance of the fragment does not explain the connection with Pericles or the exact role that Cronus/Chronus plays in the text. Part II: Cratinus and Solon If the analysis above has made a case against accepting too easily the conjecture Kpóvoç into the text of Cratinus, and if we accept that Cratinus' passage belongs to the general and uniform tradition of the archaia 37 which mercilessly lampooned Pericles as the politician who rose from stasis to become 'tyrant' of Athens, then we have to answer the question Luiselli38 aptly raises: 'può Xpóvoç caricarsi di quella valenza politica che è lecito aspettarsi da lui, se si considera che nello schema genealogico in cui è inserito la sua funzione sembra proprio quella di contribuire con ZTCtaiç alla definizione della tirannide di Zeus, non alla caratterizzazione esclusiva di ZTctaiç stessa?'39 In the play the ghost of Solon is raised from Hades and appears on the stage. Two surviving lines which enacted Solon's reported wish in Diogenes Laertius 1.62 that his ashes should be scattered over the island of Salamis may come from his opening speech: oÌK€co 8è vfjerov, (hç pèv àvôpùJTTtov Xóyoç, ècrTTappivoç Kara Trâaav AiavToç ttóXiv (. PCG 246) This is the island where I live: my dust, men say, is scattered everywhere over the land of Ajax Norwood40 in his reconstruction of the play's plot noted: 'we do not find what we would expect - quotations, exact or parodied, from Solon's work, at any rate among the 36 Schibli (1990) 101, 103; West (1963) 164: 'it is easier to suppose that there is simply a shift of emphasis in the narrative: Zas instead of Chronus becomes the centre of the attention. Chronus is not cast out, he merely withdraws into the background.' 37 See n. 23 above. 38 Luiselli (1990) 88. 39 That Chronus would entail the sense of the long duration of stasis was one of the arguments put forward by Luppe (1963) 220. According to Farioli (2000) 419 'un riferimento al Tempo non sarebbe giustificato né mitologicamente - il che costituirebbe l'impedimento minore - né sul piano simbolico'. 40 See Norwood ( 1 93 1 ) 1 27-8.

I will try to show that the lineage of Zeus-Pericles in this mock theogony41 is not a mere creation of Cratinus' poetic imagination but a dramatisation of the ideas on the emerging tyrant that Cratinus found precisely in Solon's poetry;42 and that these ideas were used by the poet in order comically to exaggerate his attack on Pericles. On the other hand, Cratinus' audience would also have been familiar enough with the concepts Solon's poetry embodied to recall it while watching the Chirones ,43 Solon's reputation as one of the Seven Sages44 would have surely been a powerful and sufficient reason for him to be used in a play whose Chorus was formed by Chirons, multiplications of the mythical figure of Centaur Chiron, much celebrated for his wisdom throughout the Greek tradition.45 But Solon was also the one who did not accept the autocracy of a tyrannis in Athens, a term which in the Athenian ideology of the fifth century most often stressed the dangers of autocracy, or its anomaly and variance with a legitimate rule.46 Indeed, according to Plutarch, Sol. 14.6 Solon had the possibility of becoming a tyrant in Athens, for even a Delphic oracle had guaranteed him success in this attempt: fļao [ìé ari v Kcrrà vrja, Kvß£pvriTf|piov epyov eüOúvw*47 TToXXoL toi 'A0r|vaL(jov èmKoupoi. We may leave aside this oracle, which is most probably late and may be fictional, and turn to Solon's poetry.

M.L. West, modified) The texts do not disclose either clearly or fully Solon' s reasons for rejecting tyranny; even more, it is impossible to ascertain any sure derogatory implication for the term tyrannos in his time and before the fifth century.48 However, if there is no reason to assume that Solon believed tyranny to be a form of rule intrinsically abusive and violent, it is hard to imagine that an Attic fifth-century audience would not have believed it to be so. The verb |iiaiya), whose original meaning in epic implied the idea of material pollution,49 evoked afterwards more or less clearly a stain of blood or a contamination connected with the hands that have accomplished the 4dirty' action.50 The connection 48 As is particularly stressed e.g. by Hegyi (1965); Catenacci (1996) 203-10; Parker (1998). 49 Horn.//. 16.795-6,23.732. 50 Stain of blood: Aesch.

If he had become tyrant he would have felt the pollution and the disgrace of his kXéoç.52 What is expressed here anticipates many of the ideas of the fifth-century regarding tyranny, which more and more became a metaphor for the political abuse of the bad autocracy or, more generally, of the way personal leadership could be divorced from democratic institutions. Solon illustrates well the capacity of a harsh and tyrannical politician to move the masses the way he wants with the use of the goad (kc vTpov 8 ' àXkoç (hę £ y to Xaßtov , I KaKO&lt;J&gt;pa8f|ç re Kai (£&gt;iXoktt||jl(ov àvf|p, I oùk av Karéox 6 ôfiM-ov, fr. 30.20-2 G-P2 = 36 W2),53 and his idea of the bad politician is rooted in the tradition of the charges against the tyrants- politicians who devour the people's wealth54 (fr. 3 1 .6-7 G-P2 = 37 W2 oùk dv kclt€(jx€ Srjļiov, où8' CTTaúaaTo, I tt pi v dvTapá^aç map é^éiXév yáXa). But above all, the Athenian lawgiver Solon was, as pointed out more recently,55 the first of the Greeks to present a genuine political interpretation of the genesis of tyranny. This fact most probably underlay the explanation Diogenes Laertius 1.49 gave of Solon's fr. 14 G-P2 = 10 W2.

West) The fragment could have been declaimed in the assembly ( ekklesia ) by Solon, shortly before the events that led Peisistratus to seize absolute power, as his response to the accu- sations of madness made against him by the Peisistratean supporters. Though the truth of this late testimony cannot be accepted unquestioningly for it may involve some 'enriched' anecdotal reconstruction (which reminds us of the disguise ascribed to Solon by the testimonies56 while performing fr. 2 G-P2 =1-3 W2), the text itself can hardly be interpreted to mean anything else than the emphasis on the passing of time as a necessary condition for the fulfilment of Solon's prediction about the outbreak of tyranny. 51 In Homer it is used of the effort made to engage someone in speech for an important reason: see Kirk (1985) on//. 1.582. 52 According to another interpretation, less plausible in my view, Solon in these lines would confirm having 'polluted' his genos by not accepting the tyranny: for Solon's critics his refusal of tyrannis was an act of cowardice (Solon, fr. 29a G-P2 = 33 W2: see Noussia (2001) 342-3). In fifth-century Athens, however, such interpretations of Solon's text could hardly be conceived. 53 Cf. later Thgn. 847-8, Sophocles, TrGF 683, Euripides, TGF 604. See Catenacci (1991). í4 Ho m. II.

The autocratic danger would not reveal itself at once: Solon concentrates his attention on the process of the tyrant's emergence59 as an important issue to be considered for itself; the notion that the manifestation of a tyrant' s supreme power needs some time for its full development, during which the Athenians could but did not do anything to prevent it, is implied in the warning of lines 5-6 Xi ay 8' èÇápauT' &lt;ov&gt; paiSioy cem KaTaaxciy I ucrrepoy, àXX' fļ8r| xpií &lt;TT6pi&gt;60 TîàyTa yociy.

Of course Cratinus inflates Solon's text in order to achieve greater comic effect in portraying Pericles. In any case, monarchos seems to be a synonym of tyrannos in fifth-century texts: see Rosivach (1988) 43. 58 For Peisistratus' first tyranny cf. Hdt. 1 .59.4-5, for the second phase Hdt. 1 .61 . 1 , and for his final estab- lishment Hdt. 1.61.3-64.3. 59 On tyranny as a process see Sancisi-Weerdenburg (2000) 13 and 15. 60 ForiTÉpí see Noussia (2001) 283.</page><page sequence="12">THE LANGUAGE OF TYRANNY IN CRATINUS, PCG 258 85 Here he presents the political mistake of the demos which allowed their leaders to assume power that ultimately turned them into slaves: 'you raised these men up (aÙToi yàp toutouç T1ÙÇf)aaT6),61 by providing them support62 and that's why wretched slavery has been your lot' : once again, the coming of tyranny is not considered a single sudden event, but a process. Last but not least we have to remember that the first occurrence of the word stasis as related to political struggle within a polis is found in Solon,63 and that Solon is also the first one to connect slavery with it. Though again Solon's passage actually leaves open whether slavery is to be understood as a state under a single tyrant or not, again to an Attic audience a connection between stasis and slavery under a tyrant would be apparent.64 tout' fļ0T| TTacn] TTÓXei ëpxcTai ehe oç à&lt;f)UKTOv, è? 8è KaKTļv Taxétoç fļXu0e 8ouXoaúvr|v, f) crràaiv ep.&lt;ļ&gt;uXov TTÓXefióv 0' cuSovt' éíTeyeípei, oç TToXXajv èpaTTìv ooXeaev tíXikít|v (fr. 3.17-20 G-P2 = 4 W2) this aims a sure blow at the whole community, and soon it comes to wretched slavery which rouses war from sleep, and strife within the clan, and sunders many from their lovely youth. (tr. M.L. West) So even though we do not know whether Solon is foreseeing tyranny here or not, such an interpretation of the passage is surely appealing to any Athenian, especially after the Peisistratean experience. It is in this sense that Solon's fragment is imitated already by Theognis 49- 5265: cut' av Toten KaKotai &lt;1&gt;CX' àvSpáai TaüTa yévrp-ai, KepSea Sriļioaicoi aw kokcol èpxó|ieva. €K tcjüv yàp aTaoïéç Te Kal êp4&gt;uXoi cf)óvoi àvSpiõv [jLOuyapxoi Te* TTÓXei p.f)TTOT€ TfjiSe aboi when things like that are chosen by dishonest men - gain that comes hand in hand with public ill.

Cyrnus, this city is pregnant, and I fear she will give birth to an insolent man, a leader of grievous strife. To sum up, I hope to have shown that Solon's poetry had much to say on the process that precedes the stage of absolute rule by a tyrannos. Moreover the ambiguity in some of Solon's texts could only enlarge the scope of its reception by fifth-century poets and audience. It is thus a fair inference and a reasonable conclusion that Cratinus inherited Solon's output for his Pericles. In any case, Cratinus' chorus provides Pericles' father with a comic mantle: Trpcaßuycvris' certainly suggests anthropomorphic personification for the concept 'Time' (cf. Aeschylus, P V 98 1 6 yripdoKwy xpóvoç, Sophocles, OC 7-8 XpÓVOÇ £wò)V I ¡lCLKpÒÇ 8l8d&lt;JK€l). A final point: the case for keeping Chronus in the text is advocated also by a further twist in Pericles' comic lineage.66 One might argue that both parents are Cratinus' comic deformations of Zeus' Hesiodic parents: cmiais* fromīaTaļiai would provide an inept opposite to the Hesiodic Rhea, if one takes into account that one of the popular etymologies67 for fPća connected the word with peiv, 'to flow' . There should be nothing comic in keeping Hesiod's Kpóvoç. Instead, the passage of Cratinus gains added comic point if we realise in full the sexual implications of Trpcaßuycvfis' Xpóvoç: Pericles was conceived by the sexual intercourse of an old (?impotent) father, and a stationary, statue-like, mother. Such an interpretation would have been an attractive 'surplus' to the Solonian hypotext, even though there is no chronological evidence that Pericles' s real father, Xanthippus,68 contracted his marriage at an advanced age. At the same time it cannot be ruled out that, though directly referring to a personified Xpovos' the Chirones might have made a pun on the more expected Cronus69 as the father of Zeus, whose great, primeval antiquity had already become proverbial in the fifth century.70 UNIVERSITY OF CHIETI MARIA NOUSSIA 66 I would like to thank Richard Hunter for this point. 67 See Hopkinson (1984). 68 Davies ( 1 97 1 ) 455-6 gives 520 bc as the latest possible date of Xanthippus' birth and 496 bc as the latest possible date for his marriage to Agariste. Forrest (1960) 233 n. 3 had proposed an earlier date for his marriage (in the 500s) which does not seem possible (see Davies' objections). On Agariste' s and Xanthippus' marriage see Hdt. 6.131.2, Plut. Vit. Per. 3. 69 As Ruffell (2000) 486-7 sustained most recently. Also Luppe (1963) 220. 70 Cf.
