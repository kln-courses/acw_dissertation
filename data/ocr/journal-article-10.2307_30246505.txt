<plain_text><page sequence="1">BASKETMAKER II MORTUARY PRACTICES: SOCIAL DIFFERENTIATION AND REGIONAL VARIATION KATHY MOWRER ABSTRACT In this paper, I examine one of the most complex and varied of human expres- sions; the relationship between the living and the dead. Mortuary studies indicate that burial practices can provide clues about social differentiation and regional variation. Basketmaker II (ca 2000 B.C.-A.D. 500) groups appear to fall between band-and tribal-levels of social organization, a few extraordinary burials, however, suggest social differentiation unusual for small-scale societies. Some archaeolo- gists have observed material cultural differences that suggest Eastern and Western Basketmaker II ethnic distinctions. I examine the burial items that accompanied Basketmaker II burials for evidence of gender and age differentiation and examine the burial data for burial orientation and single and multi-individual burial prac- tices that support the hypothesis that two distinct Basketmaker II groups inhabited the northern Southwest. RESUMEN En este trabajo, examino una de las expresiones humanas mds compleja y variada; la relacidn entre los vivos y los muertos. Los estudios funerarios indican que las prdcticas de entierro pueden proporcionar claves sobre la diferenciaci6n social y la variacidn regional. En cuanto a la organizaci6n social, parece que los grupos de Basketmaker II (ca. 2000 AC de 500 DC) se situen entre bandas y tribus. Sin embargo algunos entierros extraordinarios sugieren una diferenciaci6n social poco usual para las sociedades pequefias. Algunos ar- que6logos han observado diferencias culturales en materiales que sugieren distinciones etnicas entre Basketmaker II occidental y Basketmaker II oriental. Para apoyar la la hip6- tesis que dos grupos distintos de Basketmaker II habitaron el sudoeste nortefio examino los articulos de entierro que acompaiiaron los entierros de Basketmaker II para evidencia de diferenciaci6n en cuanto al genero y la edad, y estudio los datos de los entierros para la orientaci6n de los entierros y para analizar las prdcticas funerarias simples y multiples.

A few documented Basketmaker II burials, however, contained exceptional and inor- dinate numbers of burial items that suggest social differentiation unusual for small-scale societies. Several archaeologists have observed material culture distri- bution patterns that appear to represent clear ethnic distinctions between Eastern and Western Basketmaker II groups. Most of these observations rely on material culture differences (Berry 1982, 1985; Berry and Berry 1986; Charles 2000; Mat- son 1991, 1994, 1999, Morris and Burgh 1954). Other elements of Eastern and Western Basketmaker II variability, such as mortuary practices, have received less attention. In this paper, I examine the social organization and ethnic diversity hypotheses in the context of Basketmaker II funerary practices. I investigate the burial items that accompanied Basketmaker II burials for evidence of gender and age differentiation and examine the data for burial orientation and single and multiple burial patterns that suggest two distinct Basketmaker II groups occupied the northern Southwest. STUDY AREA The Basketmaker II mortuary data were compiled from Eastern and Western Bas- ketmaker II site concentrations from the Four Comers region of the US Southwest (Figure 1). The Western Basketmaker II site concentrations include groups of sites in the Marsh Pass and Canyon de Chelly region in northeastern Arizona, and the Butler Wash-Cedar Mesa region in southeastern Utah. The Eastern Basketmaker II site concentrations include the Navajo Reservoir District in northeastern New Mexico along the New Mexico and Colorado border, and sites in the Animas River Valley near Durango, Colorado. For convenience and clarity, the site con- centrations are referred to by state throughout the remainder of this paper. I do not however, suggest that Eastern and Western Basketmaker II populations de- fined themselves by the boundaries imposed today. SOCIAL DIFFERENTIATION Goodenough (1965) and Binford (1971) define social persona and the scope that social differentiation encompasses. Goodenough (1965) states that social differ- entiation encompasses the social persona, and is ... "a composite of the social identities maintained in life and recognized as appropriate for consideration in death" (Goodenough 1965). Binford (1971) building on Goodenough's expla- nation, adds that social differentiation in burial practices reflect ... "age, gender, rank, status, social position(s), and social affiliation(s) (membership in a clan, sodality, or moiety)" (Binford 1971). Accordingly, social identities recognized in death, such as age, gender, rank, social positions, and social affiliations, can pro-</page><page sequence="3">BASKETMAKER II MORTUARY PRACTICES 261 vide important insights into a society's social complexity. Band- and tribal-level societies generally mark only age and gender differences, economic roles, and personal achievement in mortuary practices. In contrast, larger, ranked societies mark age, gender, social positions, social affiliations, rank, and ascribed status in funerary practices (Binford 1971; Saxe 1970). Previous Basketmaker II studies indicate that the funerary objects that typi- cally accompanied Basketmaker II burials suggest a band- or tribal-level of social organization. The funerary objects tend to reflect age, gender, economic roles, and personal achievement (Kidder and Guernsey 1919; Guernsey and Kidder 1921; Morris and Burgh 1954). For example, cradleboards accompanied many infant burials, string skirts accompanied female burials, and hunting tools generally ac- companied male burials (Guernsey and Kidder 1921; Morris and Burgh 1954). The three examples discussed below however, suggest that not all Basketmaker II burials indicate a band- or tribal-level of social organization. UNUSUAL BASKETMAKER II BURIALS The first example is a female burial from White Dog Cave (Figure 1), a Basket- maker II site in the Marsh Pass site concentration that was excavated by Guernsey and Kidder (1921). This burial contained 19 different types of grave items. The fu- nerary objects included an atlatl, projectile points (items that often accompanied male burials), baskets, woven items, digging sticks, and several unusual burial items, including a dog, a gaming piece, a skin pouch, and a ceremonial wand (Guernsey and Kidder 1921). Another example, the "Chiefs Grave," was excavated by Morris (1925) in Canyon de Chelly (Figure 1). This male burial contained a number of hunting tools and adornments, including four atlatls, an antler wrench, numerous flaking tools, several shell necklaces, a large stone pipe, hanks of human hair, and four flutes. One flute reached from the Chiefs chin to his thighs and reminded Morris of purported Kokopelli images, (Morris 1925). The "Chiefs Grave" is the only Basketmaker II burial in this study that contained flutes. A third interesting Basketmaker II burial is a young female found in Cave I from Kinboko Canyon, southwest of White Dog Cave in Marsh Pass (Figure 1). This burial contained probably one of the most unique burial items, the entire head-skin of a 35 to 45 year old male, (Michele Morgan, Peabody Museum, per- sonal communication 2002). A leather thong, broken at the time of discovery, probably attached the head-skin around the female's neck. The hair on the head- skin was carefully arranged and the face was painted with bands of green, white, red, and yellow pigment (Kidder and Guernsey 1919). The other burial items included a string apron, several shell bead necklaces, and a stone pendant. The funerary objects that accompanied these examples, the female from White Dog Cave, the Chiefs Grave, and the female from Cave 1, at Kinboko Canyon are not</page><page sequence="4">262 KATHY MOWRER Utah Colorado FIGURE 1.

Marsh Pass site concentrations, and 5.Canyon de Chelly site concentrations. typical Basketmaker II burial accompaniments. These funerary objects suggest ranking and status unusual for a small-scale society. EASTERN AND WESTERN BASKETMAKER II DISTINCTIONS Morris and Burgh (1954) noted differences between Eastern and Western Basket- maker II groups as early as 1954. Current Basketmaker II models build on Morris' and Burgh's research. Berry (1982, 1985) and Berry and Berry (1986) suggest that the San Pedro Cochise groups were responsible for the Western Basketmaker II tradition in Arizona and Utah and for the spread of agriculture across the north- ern Southwest. Matson (1991, 1994, 1999) and other archaeologists (Charles</page><page sequence="5">BASKETMAKER II MORTUARY PRACTICES 263 2000; Cole, personal communication 2003; Hovezak and Sesler, personal com- munication 2003), reject the migration model for Eastern Basketmaker II groups. Instead, the Eastern Basketmaker II peoples are believed to be descendants of indigenous, mountain-adapted populations whose origins extend at least back to the Archaic Period (Charles 2000; Matson 1991, 1994, 1999). The evidence for two distinct Basketmaker II populations includes elements of material culture, rock art, discrete dental traits, and burial orientation (Mabry 1998; Matson 1991, 1994, 1999; Morris and Burgh 1954; Robins 1997; Schaafsma 1980; Turner 1993; Webster and Hays-Gilpin 1994). Twilled, woven tule sandals, half-rod and bundle basket foundations, and comer-notched projectile points, sim- ilar to Archaic projectile points from surrounding regions to the north and west, characterize Eastern Basketmaker assemblages. Cord, bark, cross-woven yucca-leaf sandals, two-rod-bundle basket foundations, and side-notched projectile points, similar to the San Pedro Cochise tradition from south-central Arizona, generally characterize Western Basketmaker assemblages (Matson 1991,1994, 1999; Webster and Hays-Gilpin 1994). The large, detailed, heroic figures adorned with headdress- es, earrings, fringed aprons, and pendants, characteristic of Western Basketmaker II rock art are lacking at Eastern Basketmaker II sites (Cole 1993; Robins 1997; Schaaf- sma 1980). Instead, small, simple, abstract, anthropomorphic figures characterize rock art at Eastern Basketmaker II sites. Turner (1993) reported significant discrete dental trait data that support Eastern and Western Basketmaker II differences. West- em Basketmaker II dentition was similar to Mesoamerican populations. Additional dental data and retabulation of the original data support the original findings that Eastern and Western Basketmaker II populations were very different (Steve LeBlanc, personnel communication, March 2006). Moreover, burial data from a report by Mabry (1998) suggests that Eastern Basketmaker II burials, particularly in the Du- rango area, are generally oriented toward the north and that burial orientation var- ies among Western Basketmaker II burials. RESEARCH METHODS A literature review of more than 30 years of mortuary studies suggest that burial items, burial preparation, burial location, and burial orientation often reflect so- cial differentiation and social organization. The review included cross-cultural ethnographic mortuary studies from Africa and North America and archaeologi- cal data from Neolithic, Mesolithic, and Bronze Age sites in Europe and Asia (Binfordl971, 1972; Dommasnes 1982; Goody 1962; Hodder 1984; Lillie 1997; Linton 1933; Middleton 1982; M6nnig 1967; Randsborg 1994; Rega 1997; Saxe 1970; Tainter 1978). The North American examples include Mississippian pe- riod burials from the Southeast, protohistoric burials from the Great Plains, and prehistoric Hohokam, Sinagua, and Pueblo burials from the Southwest (Crotty</page><page sequence="6">264 KATHY MOWRER 1983; Crown and Fish 1996; Ellis 1968; Hohmann 2001; McGuirel992; Palkov- ich 1980; O'Shea 1984; Peebles and Kus 1977; Whittlesey and Reid 2001). The Basketmaker II period literature search identified Basketmaker II burial information collected over the past 100 years. The study began with excavations and research conducted in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century in the Four Comers area by individuals such as Richard Wetherill (Blackburn and Williamson 1997), Kidder and Guernsey (1919), Guernsey and Kidder (1921), Lockett and Hargrave (1953), Nusbaum (1922), Morris (1925), and Morris and Burgh (1954). Two major contract archaeological projects, the Glen Canyon Archaeological Sal- vage Project (Lipe 1960; Lipe et al.1960; Long 1966; Sharrock et al.1963), along the Utah and Arizona border, and the Navajo Reservoir Project (Eddy 1961,1966) along the New Mexico and Colorado border, provided ad- ditional Basketmaker II burial data. The Museum of New Mexico Laboratory of Anthropology conducted the Navajo Reservoir Proj- ect research in northwestern New Mexico. During the Navajo Reservoir Project, Eddy (1961, 1966) identi- fied 16 small Basketmaker II open-air village sites in the Navajo Reservoir District. The Museum of North- ern Arizona and the University of Utah conducted the Glen Canyon Archaeological Salvage Project along the Arizona and Utah border. Lipe identified 17 Basketmaker II components during the Glen Can- yon Dam Project (Lipe 1960; Lipe et al. 1960). Additional Basketmaker II burial data was gleaned from research projects over the past 30 years. These projects included excavations on Black Mesa (Nichols and Smiley 1984; Powell and Smiley 2002; Smiley 1984, 1985; Smiley et al. 1983; Smiley et al. 1986; Spurr et al. 1994), Red Rocks Plateau, Butler Wash and Cedar Mesa in Utah (Dohm 1994; Lind- say et al.1968; Lipe 1970; Lipe and Matson 1971; Matson 1994, Smiley and Robins 1997a), Navajo Mountain and Rainbow Plateau, along the lower San Juan River, (Geib 1994; Geib et al. 1993; Geib and Spurr 2000), and the Tamarron site in southwestern Colorado (Reed and Kainer 1978). Current research includes on-going excavations at the Darkmold site north of Durango, Colorado (Charles 2000). A total of 391 burials, 5 burials from New Mexico, 113 burials from Colorado, 138 burials from Utah, and 135 burials from Arizona were in- Table 1.

The gender category (which in this study represents the bi- ological characteristics of sex) includes 56 females and 81 males. Gender was not identified for 254 individuals. The age category includes 89 infants, individuals up to 3 years old; 71 subadults, individuals from 4 to 16 years of age; 180 adults, individuals over 16 years of age; and 51 individuals of unknown age. The regional frequencies for gender and age are presented in Tables 1 and 2 respectively. MORTUARY VARIABLES The mortuary data were coded using 98 mortuary variables and divided into three categories: provenience, burial descriptions, and burial items. Variables 1 through Table 2.

The site num- ber, state, region, site type (rock shelter or open air), feature number, burial number, and burial provenience (midden, terrace, floor, etc.) place the burials within a spatial and categorical framework. The regional Basketmaker II phase designations Los Pinos (New Mexico), Durango Basketmakers (Colorado), Grand Gulch (Utah), Lolomai (Ari- zona, ca. 2200-1600 BP), and White Dog (Arizo- na, ca. 4000-2000 BP), place each site regionally. Variables 12 through 28, the burial descriptions, include information about age, gender, head ori- entation, body position, burial context, single or multi-individual burial, primary or secondary buri- al, and the type, and shape of the grave. The largest group of variables, 32 through 98, includes the burial items and the burial item subsets. Because of the large database and lack of informa- tion in many of the burial categories, certain burial items were compartmentalized into Burial Subsets after determining the context in which each artifact was most often found. Burial Subsets 1, 2, and 3 include utilitarian items that can provide informa- tion about gender specific industries and economic roles. Burial Subsets 4, 5, and 6 include burial items that suggest gender and/or age differentiation, grave preparation, status, and ceremonial use. In addition, Burial Subset 6, rare burial items, includes funerary objects that accompanied less than one percent of Basketmaker II burials (Table 3).</page><page sequence="8">266 KATHY MOWRER TABLE 3.

For example, if a burial contained 96 olivella shell beads, the burial item was assigned a 1 for presence of olivella shell beads, not 96 for the total number of beads that accompanied the individual. Burial items associated with an individual's demise, such as the projectile points or knives embedded in bone or within the skeletal remains of many of the individuals from Cave 7 at Cedar Mesa, Utah, were not classified as associated funerary objects and therefore, not included in the burial item count. Two variables from the second database category, burial descriptions, were analyzed to determine if Eastern and Western Basketmaker II burial practices dif- fered. First, the data were analyzed for head orientation patterns of the deceased to determine if Basketmaker II groups from a particular region oriented their dead to a specific direction. Second, the burial data were analyzed to determine if Basketmaker II groups from a region tended to place the deceased in single or multi-individual burial complexes. To readily discern head orientation pat- terns, the head orientation variables were compartmentalized into four subsets, North, South, East, and West. The variable, North, includes burials in which the head of the deceased was oriented to the north, northwest, and northeast. The variable, South, includes burials in which the head of the deceased was oriented to the south, southeast, and southwest. The East and West variables include indi- viduals oriented to the east and west respectively. The frequencies for single and multi-individual burial complexes and head orientation for each region appear in Tables 4 and 5.</page><page sequence="9">BASKETMAKER II MORTUARY PRACTICES 267 TABLE 4.

Moreover, because the statistical tests only identified corresponding relationships, the bar graphs and contingency tables provided the information necessary to determine the strength and significance of the correspondences identified by the statistical tests.</page><page sequence="10">268 KATHY MOWRER Several problems with the data, such as sample size disparities, preser- vation problems, insufficient numbers of female, infant, and sub-adult burials, precluded the use of parametric tests to determine social differentiation. First, preservation at open-air sites is poor. Perishable items and burials in unprotected areas often do not survive the ravages of time as well as burials and burial items located in protected rock shelters. Second, the burials for which age category or gender could not be identified were not included in the exploratory data analysis and chi-square statistical tests. In the case of gender, this severely limited the sam- ple size because gender was identified for only 35 percent of the burials. For that reason, the non-parametric chi-square test was used to identify relationships be- tween the burial subsets and the gender and age categories and between head ori- entation and single and multi-individual burials for each region. The chi-square tests identifies dependent and independent variables, but unlike parametric tests requires no assumption about the exact shape of the population distribution. (The graphs and the contingency tables and chi-square tables are not presented in this paper. They are available upon request). Because approximately 70 percent of the Utah burials came from Cave 7, the site of a massacre, the Utah mortuary data were analyzed with and without the Cave 7 burials. Previous studies suggest that the funerary objects that accom- panied the Cave 7 burials contrast with the burial assemblages reported from other sites (Kidder and Guernsey 1919; Guernsey and Kidder 1921; Nusbaum 1922). According to those studies, the usual Basketmaker II funerary items, which consisted of woven bags, woven, or fur blankets, and baskets were almost totally absent for the Cave 7 burials. Instead, artifacts associated with warfare, including bifacial dart points, knife blades, and bone blades, dominated the Cave 7 burial assemblage. In addition, the New Mexico data were not included in the analyses because only five Basketmaker II burials were identified. HYPOTHESES FOR ALL AGE AND GENDER DIFFERENTIATION The .05 level was used as the criterion to determine the significance of the chi- square results for the age and gender differentiation study. The null hypothesis in the case of the chi-square, states that the two variables tested will be independent of each other. For example, burial subset one, hunting tools would be found with male, female, adult, subadult and infants burials equally and indicate Bas- ketmaker II peoples did not mark gender or age differences in funerary practices. The research hypothesis contradicts the null hypothesis. The presence of hunting tools would be dependent on the age of the individual and reflect age differen- tiation at, at least the band- or tribal-level. For instance, hunting tools would be found significantly more often with a particular gender and/or age group.</page><page sequence="11">BASKETMAKER II MORTUARY PRACTICES 269 HYPOTHESES FOR REGIONAL VARIATION The null hypothesis for regional variation in the rationale of the chi-square stated that the two variables tested would be independent of each other and not support current models that suggest two distinct Basketmaker II groups populated the northern Southwest. In other words, burial orientation and placing individuals in single or multi-individual burial complexes would not vary between Eastern and Western Basketmaker II groups. The research hypothesis stated that the vari- ables tested, head orientation and single or multi-individual burials, would vary according to region and support current models that suggest two distinct Basket- maker II groups occupied the northern Southwest. The .05 significance level was used as the criterion in the regional variation study. PAN-REGIONAL RESULTS FOR AGE AND GENDER DIFFERENTIATION The pan-regional chi-square tests rejected the null hypothesis for two of the buri- al subsets. The presence of textiles and bedding in female graves appears to be significant. Textiles and bedding accompanied female burials most often (Table 6). The exploratory data analysis indicates that bedding accompanied 21 percent of the female burials and six percent of the male burials. Textiles accompanied 88 percent of the female burials and only 17 percent of the male burials. Gender, however, was identified for only 35 percent (138) of the 391 burials. Thus, infer- ences about gender differentiation and economic roles based on only 35 percent of the population remain inconclusive. The pan-regional analysis suggests that Basketmaker II groups did mark age differences through funerary practices. Age category was identified for 80 percent of Basketmaker II burials and the chi-square tests found a correspondence be- tween age category and all of the burial subsets except gathering tools (Table 7). The exploratory data analysis demonstrated that hunting tools accompanied 16 percent of the adult burials and less that 5 percent of the infant or subadult buri- als. Rare items accompanied adult burial exclusively (6 percent of the burials). TABLE 6. Pan-regional results for Gender and the Burial Subsets.

Pan-regional Results for Age Category and the Burial Subsets. Hunting Gathering Tools Tools Textiles Adornments Bedding Rare Items Age Adults None Infants Adults Infants Adults (robust) (robust) (robust) (robust) (robust) Comments: Data suggest age differentiation. Infant burials consistently contained the highest percentage of textiles and bedding. Textiles accompanied 54 percent of the infant burials, 25 percent of the adult burials, and 15 percent of the subadult burials. Bedding accompanied 27 percent of the infant burials, 13 percent of the subadult burials, and 10 percent of the adult burials. Adornments accompanied about 30 percent of the adult and infant burials and about 13 percent of the subadult burials. REGIONAL RESULTS In this section, the burial subsets that accompanied male, female, adult, subadult, and infant burials in each region, are discussed. The discussion begins with the Colorado results. As noted above New Mexico was eliminated from the study be- cause only five Basketmaker II burials were identified during the literature search. COLORADO RESULTS The bar graphs demonstrate that gathering tools, textiles, and bedding accompa- nied female burials more often than male burials. The differences, however, are small; gathering tools, textiles, and bedding accompanied female burials only about 10 percent more often than male burials, and the chi-square tests did not find an association between any of the burial subsets and gender at the .05 sig- nificance level. In addition, gender was identified for about 20 percent (29 of the 118 burials) Colorado burials. Similar to the pan-regional analysis, inferences about gender differentiation among Colorado Basketmaker II groups remains inconclusive. The evidence for Colorado Basketmaker II groups marking age distinctions in mortuary practices is more substantial. Age category was identified for 75 per- cent of the Colorado burials and the chi-square tests found a correlation between hunting tools and age category. Moreover, the exploratory data analysis demon- strated that hunting tools accompanied adult burials exclusively. The results of the regional analysis suggest that Colorado Basketmaker II groups may have marked age distinctions in funerary practices. In addition, the presence of hunting tools in adult graves may be suggestive of economic roles and/or achieved status.</page><page sequence="13">BASKETMAKER II MORTUARY PRACTICES 271 The chi-square tests did not find an association between any of the other burial subsets and age; however, it is interesting that the Colorado subadult buri- als contained two to three times more burial subsets (except hunting tools) than did the infant burials. The exploratory data analysis indicated that infant burials lacked gathering tools and bedding, and that less than four percent of the tex- tiles and adornments accompanied infant burials. In contrast, gathering tools and adornments accompanied 17 percent of the subadult burials. Textiles and bedding accompanied 13 percent of the subadult burials. Rare items as defined in this study, were not found with any of the Colorado burials. UTAH RESULTS The Utah analyses that included and excluded the Cave 7 burials produced dif- ferent results. The analysis without the Cave 7 burials found no evidence of age or gender differentiation. In contrast, the chi-square test that included the Cave 7 burials found an association between gender and age category and textiles and bedding. Textiles and bedding accompanied female and infant burials most of- ten. Therefore, before inferences about Utah Basketmaker II social differentiation could be extrapolated from the data it was necessary to determine which analysis best represented Utah Basketmaker II groups. I determined that the study that included the Cave 7 burials provided a better representation of Utah Basketmaker II populations. Several factors contributed to this decision. First, contrary to suggestions that the Cave 7 artifact assemblage contained an inordinate number of projectile points, bifaces, and other weapons (Kidder and Guernsey 1919; Guernsey and Kidder 1921; Nusbaum 1922), this study found the burial items to be comparable to Basketmaker II burials from other sites throughout the Four Corners area. This is probably because the burial items associated with an individual's demise were not listed as associated funerary items, and the burial items that appear to have been intentionally placed with an individual, such as the projectile points arrayed around the head of Burial 378 and Burial 196 were included in the study. In contrast, Wetherill did not differentiate between the items associated with an individual's demise and as- sociated funerary items in his report. All of the items, including items thought to be responsible for the individual's demise, were listed as associated artifacts (H: 1894; Hurst and Turner 1993). Another consideration was sample size. The analysis that included the Cave 7 burials consisted of 66 adults in the gender category, and 122 individuals in the age category. Only 14 individuals comprised the gender category and 44 in- dividuals comprised the age category in the analysis that excluded the Cave 7 burials. Larger samples are usually better approximations of the populations they represent and are regarded as more reliable than decisions based on small sam- ples. For the reasons discussed above, the Utah analysis that included the Cave 7</page><page sequence="14">272 KATHY MOWRER burials was used to develop inferences about social differentiation among Utah Basketmaker II groups. The chi-square tests rejected the null hypothesis for gender and textiles and bedding at the .05 significance level. The exploratory data analysis, however, in- dicated that textiles accompanied 30 percent of the female burials and about 10 percent of the male burials and that bedding accompanied 20 percent of the female burials and about 10 percent of the male burials. In other words, textiles and bedding accompanied female three times as often as men and bedding ac- companied females twice as often as men. In addition, gender was identified for almost 60 percent (69 of 135 burials) of the Utah burials. Based on the explor- atory data analysis it appears that the Utah Basketmaker II groups probably did mark gender differences in funerary practices, however, because the statistical evi- dence does not support the exploratory data analysis this interpretation should be viewed with caution. Utah Basketmaker II groups marked age differences in funerary practices. The chi-square found a correspondence between age category and textiles and bedding at the .05 significance level. The bar graphs showed that textiles accom- panied 60 percent of the infant burials, seven percent of the subadult burials, and 12 percent of the adult burials. Bedding accompanied 45 percent of the infant, seven percent of the subadult, and eight percent of the adult burials. In addi- tion, the bar graphs demonstrated that hunting tools accompanied adult burials almost exclusively. To add further credibility to the evidence for age differentia- tion, age category was identified for almost 90 percent of the Utah burials. In contrast to the Colorado Basketmaker II groups, only about 7 percent of the Utah subadult burials contained any of the burial item subsets. The Utah infant buri- als contained more gathering tools, 25 percent versus seven percent for subadult burials, textiles, 60 percent versus seven percent, and bedding, 45 percent ver- sus seven percent. The other burial subsets, hunting tools, adornments, and rare items accompanied adult and infant burials most often. ARIZONA RESULTS Results for the Arizona chi-square tests demonstrated that adornments corre- sponded to gender at the .05 significance level. Adornments accompanied male burials significantly more often than female burials (89 percent versus 53 per- cent). Gender was however, identified for only 25 percent of the Arizona buri- als. The lack of identified male and female burials, and because only one burial subset corresponded to gender, the evidence for Arizona Basketmaker II groups marking gender differences in funerary practices remains inconclusive. The evidence for marking age differences in Arizona Basketmaker II in mor- tuary practices is more compelling. Age category was identified for 85 percent of</page><page sequence="15">BASKETMAKER II MORTUARY PRACTICES 273 the Arizona burials and the chi-square tests found a correspondence between age category and four of the burial subsets. Hunting tools, adornments, and rare items accompanied adult burials almost exclusively. About 80 percent of the in- fant burials, 50 percent of the adult burials, and 26 percent of the subadult buri- als contained textiles. Similar to the Utah analysis, the subadult burials usually contained the lowest percentage of burial subsets. EASTERN AND WESTERN BASKETMAKER II MORTUARY VARIABILITY The same methods outlined in the pan-regional and regional analysis were used to identify regional variations between Eastern and Western Basketmaker II pop- ulations. The data were examined for patterns that indicated individuals from a region were oriented to a particular direction, or buried in single or multi-indi- vidual burial complexes. The chi-square tests identified corresponding relation- ships between Eastern and Western Basketmaker II groups and head orientation and single or multi-individual burial complexes. The chi-square tested for Eastern and Western mortuary variability at the .05 level of significance. The lack of data precluded chi-square tests of the New Mexico burial data for head orientation patterns and single or multi-individual burial practices. SINGLE AND MULTI-INDIVIDUAL BURIALS The correspondences identified by the chi-square tests for Eastern and Western Basketmaker II and single and multi-individual burials are robust. Single and multi-individual burials were identified for more than 90 percent of the Colora- do, and about 70 percent of the Utah and Arizona burials. The analysis indicates that Eastern Basketmaker II populations generally buried their dead in single burials. Western Basketmaker II groups placed their deceased in multi-individual burial complexes (see Table 4 for percentages). HEAD ORIENTATION The chi-square statistical test for single and multi-individual burials rejected the null hypothesis for Colorado, Utah, and Arizona. Head orientation was identified for about 70 percent of the Colorado burials, and about half of the Utah and Arizo- na burials. These data indicate that 50 percent of the Eastern Basketmaker burials were oriented to the northern directions, 20 percent were oriented to the southern directions, east, and west. Western Basketmaker II groups did not appear to orient their deceased toward any specific direction (See Table 5 for percentages).</page><page sequence="16">274 KATHY MOWRER TABLE 8.

Gender identified for 25% of population. CONCLUSIONS Based on the limited sample sizes and lack of identified male and female burials, inferences about pan-regional and regional gender differentiation remain incon- clusive. There is some indication from the pan-regional and Utah data to suggest that textiles and bedding may have marked female burials perhaps indicating economic roles. Conclusions about gender differentiation based on two burial subsets and such a limited sample size however, cannot be considered conclusive. Thus, the evidence for gender differentiation at the pan-regional and regional level remains inconclusive (Tables 6 and 7). The evidence for age differentiation supports the hypothesis at the pan- regional level and regional level (Tables 8 and 9). Basketmaker II groups marked age differences in funerary practices. Hunting tools accompanied adult burials from Colorado and Arizona almost exclusively, and textiles accompanied the in- fant burials from Utah and Arizona significantly more than adult and subadult burials. Moreover, the burial items that accompanied the adult, subadult, and infant burials suggest social differentiation consistent with band- and tribal-level societies. The burial items that generally accompanied the adult Basketmaker II burials (hunting tools, adornments, and rare items) suggest economic roles and achieved status. The funerary objects (textiles) that accompanied the infant buri- als and subadult burials suggest grave and/or body preparation and grief.</page><page sequence="17">BASKETMAKER II MORTUARY PRACTICES 275 TABLE 9.

After testing the Basketmaker II period mortuary data across the broad spectrum to see if the extraordinary burials suggest social differentiation unusual for small-scale societies, I determined that the burial items suggest achieved sta- tus, economic roles, or ritual activities during life. The female burials from Cist 24 at White Dog Cave, (Guernsey and Kidder 1921) and Cave I at Kinboko Canyon (Kidder and Guernsey 1919), and the male burial from Canyon de Chelley, the "Chiefs Grave," are adult burials. I suggest that these individuals were highly regarded because of their abilities or skill at a particular task(s) and/or that the burial items reflect roles that may have included leadership or ceremonial roles in the community. In sum, Basketmaker II mortuary practices fit the expected small- scale model despite a few outliers. Eastern and Western Basketmaker II single and multiple burial practices and head orientation patterns support current models that infer two distinct Bas- ketmaker II groups inhabited the northern Southwest. Moreover, the results of the analyses for social differentiation suggest that the ways Eastern and Western Bas- ketmaker II populations marked age distinctions in funerary practices also may have differed. As noted earlier, the infant burials from Utah and Arizona (West-</page><page sequence="18">276 KATHY MOWRER em Basketmaker II groups) contained a significantly higher percentage of burial items than did the subadult burials. In contrast, the Colorado subadult burials contained a higher percentage of burial items than did infant burials. The mortu- ary analyses suggest that 1) Eastern and Western Basketmaker II head orientation patterns probably differed, 2) that single and multiple burial practices differed, and 3) that infant and subadult burials may have been treated differently. This paper demonstrates that mortuary data can provide clues about social differentiation, social organization, and cultural diversity in prehistoric times. Understanding cultural diversity in prehistoric times is especially important in the Southwest because the descendents of the prehistoric populations that con- tributed to cultural diversity in the past continue to contribute to the cultural diversity that characterizes the Southwest today. FUTURE RESEARCH The Basketmaker II mortuary database can be further tested in a myriad of ways to shed light on Basketmaker II social differentiation, regional variability, and site variability. Future investigation of Basketmaker II mortuary practices should in- clude comparison studies that examine the frequency of individual burial items according to age and gender. To understand aspects of achieved status, burial item counts can provide insights into Basketmaker II social differentiation. Rock art associated with Basketmaker II burials warrants further investiga- tion. According to Cole, (1993) several Utah rock-shelter burials were apparently placed below pictographs. An examination of rock art and Basketmaker II buri- als for correlations could provide insights into Basketmaker ideology and social structures. A re-examination of the original documentation of Talus Village and the Falls Creek Shelters could provide improved information about burial items, burial locations, and burial orientations (Morris and Burgh 1954). The same holds true for the excavations in Marsh Pass and Monument Valley (Guernsey and Kidder 1921; Kidder and Guernsey 1919). A reexamination of these burials could provide information about gender, which would permit a reevaluation of the evidence for gender differentiation among Basketmaker II groups.
