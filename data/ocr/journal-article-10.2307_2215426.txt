<plain_text><page sequence="1">D. P. Chattopadhyaya, Individuals and Worlds. Essays in Anthropoligical Rationalism (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1976), 227 pp. $8.00. J. N. MOHANTY UNIVERSIIY OF OKLAHOMA Chattopadhyaya argues for a combination of several distinct theses, not all of which are usually held by the same philosopher. These theses are: (1) that man is fallible and that human knowledge is growing, (2) that human experience is intentional in nature, (3) that knowing involves an active participation of man in the world, and (4) that all human enterprise is historical. He also holds (5) that the world has a structure of its own, independent of human knowledge, and (6) that yet the real world is the human world. (1) affiliates Chattopadhyaya to Popper (with whom he studied), (2) to phenomenology, (3) to the pragmatic point of view, (4) to a large segment of nineteenth-and twentieth-centry continental philosophy, (5) to metaphysical realism and (6) to Kant and humanism. In his attempt to develop what is called an anthropological rationalism, the main targets of attack are: all philosophies which assign sovereignty to reason (Leibniz), all anti-historical philosophies of reason (Kant) and experience (logical positivism), essentialism and the tran- scendental philosophies. In this review, instead of talking about each of some of the essays collected in the volume (and they are devoted to a great variety of themes), I want to concentrate on some of these central theses, and examine to what extent Chattopadhyaya successfully formulates them, and puts them together. and indicate a few of the problems his overall position has to face. If the thesis of human fallibility is the same as the thesis that all empirical knowledge is corrigible, then this may well have been a meeting point for empiricists and rationalists alike (leaving aside the conception of 'empirical necessary truth' recently defended by Kripke). What is at issue, then, is not the fallibility or infallibility of empirical knowledge, perceptual and scientific, and of empirical moral beliefs andjudgments. but whether empircal knowledge has a "rock-bottom basis." In fact, by 'fallibility thesis' Chattopadhyaya sometimes appears to mean the thesis that human knowledge and morality do not have any 'rock-bottom basis' (p. 25). There are at least two ways in which philoso- 150</page><page sequence="2">CHATTOPADHYAYA'S INDIVIDUALS &amp; WORLDS 151 phers have sought to provide for such a foundation: the metaphysical and the critical-transcendental. Chattopadhyaya rejects both. He even claims, without telling us how, that the criterion offalsifiability can be adequately liberalized so as to be applied to the empirical as well as the transcendental, to science as well as metaphysics (p. 82). We are only told that "metaphysical statements contain- ing less saturated concepts are corrigible and criticizable by scientific statements containing more saturated concepts." What is meant by 'saturated' in this statement? Obviously, the Fregean concept is out of place. If "saturated" means concrete, it is at least arguable that many metaphysical concepts are intended to be more concrete than many scientific concepts. More likely, he understands "saturatedness" in terms of "empirically ascertainable precision." In that case, it is clearer why and in what sense he regards metaphysical statements as corrigi- ble and criticizable by scientific statements. It is one thing to say 'corrigible' and another 'criticizable.' If a metaphysical statement is to be corrigible by scientific statements, then they should belong to the same level of discourse. If it is criticizable, one may ask what gives science the vantage point from which to criticize metaphysics, and contrary to the traditional view that scientific think- ing, proceeding as it does from a limited point of view, must submit itself to metaphysical criticism? According to Chattopadhyaya, it is the precise information-content of science that gives it the right to criticize metaphysics. And, instead of requiring, as I have just said, that to be criticizable by scientific statements, metaphysical statements should belong to the same level of dis- course, D.P.C. prefers to regard scientific statements as belonging to a lower level than the metaphysical one, precisely because its information-content is more precise and its comprehension-range lesser. In effect, we have a theory according to which statements of a lower level will provide criticism and correction for statements of a higher level. As he wants to put it, the empirical should provide the basis for criticizing the transcendental. One cannot but ask, in that case, why talk at all of the transcendental? Of the metaphysical foundation philosophies, Chattopadhyaya has many things to say about essentialism; of the critical-transcendental, his criticisms are directed against Kant and Husserl. First as to Kant: if Kant was right in recognizing the spontaneity and creativity of thought, we are told, he betrayed that Copernican revolution by not going far enough. While, on the one hand, Kant is accused of not seeing the spontaneity of scientific thinking, he is also, on the other, blamed for making reason autonomous. (Kant's 'autonomous rea- son' is distinguished from the Leibnizian 'sovereign reason.') It would seem rather strange that one would raise this last point against Kant when post- Kantian German idealists, notably Hegel, complained precisely against the Kantian efforts to limit human reason and its autonomy, in the cognitive enterprise, and when modern commentators like Heidegger have seen in Kant's thought anticipations of an ontology of the finiteness of human exis- tence. The freedom of scientific activity of which Chattopadhyaya finds no recognition in Kant, would be a freedom unfettered by the allegedly a-historical, essentialistic and invariant structure which Kant ascribes to thought. Once human reason is historicized, once its fallibility and situatedness are recognized, then it becomes free and spontaneous, while at the same time remaining mundane and human. What then Chattopadhyaya is up against is the a-historical a priori structure which Kant ascribes to reason. [The possibility that there could very well be an a priori and an essence which is historical, perhaps, would be closer to his point of view. Hegel and Marx played with this possibility, but, quite understandably, both remained historicist and essen- tialist, both were committed to the idea of infallible scientific truth, which is ill</page><page sequence="3">152 NOJS compatible with Chattopadhyaya's fallibilism.] Now, it may very well be urged that the historicity of human cognitive striving, the fallibility of all epistemic claims and the hypothetical character of all scientific theories, are perfectly well compatible with an invariant core structure of human thinking. Kant may have been unduly fascinated by Euclidean geometry and Newtonian physics, but the Kantian a priori may still retain its validity, as von Weizsacker has well argued with regard to quantum physics and the Kantian Analogies of Experience. Kantian transcendental philosophy need not be committed to an unchanging body of scientific truths; its fundamental commitment, as transcendental phi- losophy, is rather to a minimal but unchanging structure of the human mind. At the same time, one may want to question the rather unlimited use that philosophers make of the concept of fallibility. One may want to say that although all cognitive claims with regard to empirical matters are fallible, there nevertheless are logical truths, essential truths and truths about one's own inner life of consciousness which are infallible. Chattopadhyaya challenges all three claims. To say that logical truths are true in all possible worlds is, he argues (44-5), of no use, for the idea of possible worlds itself is defined by the very same logical principles or by principles from which these truths are deducible. I find this argument weak, for if the idea of possible worlds is defined in terms of logical truths, and if there is no other way of defining 'possible world,' then that only confirms the necessity of logical truths, and the contention that there must be some other concept of possibility such that any possible worlds defined in accordance with that concept of logical truths do not obtain. would be pointless. The point about essential truths is different, if by essential truths we mean truths pertaining to non-logical, 'material,' essences. I find in Chattopadhyaya no argument against essentialism excepting a brief and somewhat misleading reminder about problems arising out of questions of reference and modality (p. 162). But given the historicism and the anthropomorphic ontology which he advocates, essentialism has to go. I think there is a confusion here between the thesis that claims to know essential truths are all incorrigible and the thesis that essential truths themselves are necessary. One may hold the latter, ontological thesis, and yet deny the former, which is an epistemological thesis. Neither does self-reflection provide, according to Chattopadhyaya, a knowledge that is infallible and uncriticizable. Husserl, it is well known, began by holding, in the Ideas I, that the immanent perception of one's own inner life of consciousness is indubitable, adequate and apodictic, but gradually, as he more and more came to see the temporality of consciousness, suspected the claim to adequancy, but not quite the claim to apodicticity. Chattopadhyaya has not shown that there is no core of apodicticity in one's self-awareness. He may be right that that core cannot be sufficient to provide a foundation for knowledge. One may retain some form of essentialism and believe in the certainty of one's own self- awareness, without being a foundationalist in epistemology. It is the latter against which Chattopadhyaya's criticisms are primarily directed. It is not against Husserl's constitutive intentionality that he argues. What he wants to reject is rather any attempt to place the constitutive intentionality above the world. I think his point is about the same as Merleau-Ponty's, when Merleau-Ponty insists that transcendental subjectivity regarded as a purely inner, non-temporal, worldless constituting ego, needs a fully determinate objective conception of the world. Since Chattopadhyaya wants to make con- stitutive intentionality human, worldly, historical and fallible, reality too be- comes for him a process in formation. If man without world is an abstraction, so also is world without man. Realism (in the sense of Merleau-Ponty's 'objective</page><page sequence="4">CHATTOPADHYAYA'S INDIVIDUALS &amp; WORLDS 153 prejudice') and idealism (in the sense of Husserl's transcendental ego) are both rejected. Concrete reality becomes a dialectical process involving both man and world. This is an attractive position, anticipated in Marx's 1844 manuscripts in his concept of "humanisation of nature." Problems that remain unsolved, in this anthropological conception, concern: for one thing, an account of the distinction between 'nature' and 'culture,' and, for another, an account of the very possibility of history. As regards the first question, Chattopadhyaya rec- ognizes that reality is both given and presupposed (pp. 205-6), but what is given is both nature (in perception) and culture (in tradition) and an anthropological philosophy has to account for this very distinction. Furthermore-and this was the second question raised above-the concept of history itself needs explica- tion. How is the sense 'history' constituted? One is led thereby to an analysis that is trans-historical. Last but not least, any anthropological philosophy has to operate within the constraints of an unanalyzed concept of 'man,' and Chat- topadhyaya's attempt is no exception. It is one thing to say that the empirical sciences of history, anthropology and linguistics are deepening our knowledge of ourselves, i.e. of human nature. But the anthropological philosopher is in a very different predicament, he uses the concept of man as a transcendental principle, as a source of significations, as the constitutive source. In doing so, he places himself in an unstable position between two extremes, none of which would satisfy him. Either he is only giving an 'anthropological version' of the transcendental subjectivity (which is what Heidegger does in Sein und Zeit), or he is doing something that is continuous with the empirical human sciences (which makes his position questionable as a philosophical interpretation of those sciences).</page></plain_text>
