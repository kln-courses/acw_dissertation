One is offensive power, the ability to inflict harm on others or to exert threats. This stimulates the arms race and is detrimental to international security. The other is defensive power, invulnerability, the ability to resist harm intended by others, which strengthens international security. This paper classifies various measures, both military and non-military, intended to protect national security, along the offensive-defensive dimension. Among the defensive measures considered is the potential for self-sufficiency in vital sectors of the economy, such as food and energy, during an emergency, as an alternative to reliance on obtaining such supplies from abroad, if necessary by force. It is then examined to what extent the Swiss concept of general defense corresponds to a desirable model. Ways are proposed in which a country can contribute to international peace, without risking its security through unilateral disarmament, through a form of transarmament', a shift to purely defensive measures, which do not reduce the security of others, but may indeed strengthen it as well. 1. Introduction With the ever increasing destructiveness of modern weapons, especially nuclear, bio- logical and chemical weapons, the world faces the danger that a future world war could bring an end to human civilization, or even human life. To prevent this is the most urgent task of all. Most ordinary people want peace. But in the approaches to safeguarding peace, people differ. Some seek 'peace through strength', through overwhelming military superiority over their opponents. But if both pursue that goal, this only leads to an uncontrolled arms race and ultimate inse- curity for all. Others advocate unilateral disarmament as a form of peace initiatives. Yet history has shown that defenseless na- tions easily fall victim to aggressors, regard- less of their proclaimed neutrality. Is there a way out of this dilemma? One approach to international security is negotiated mutual disarmament. Unfortun- ately, the recent history of disarmament negotiations has proved this approach to be a failure, partly because of the lack of a supranational entity that can enforce agree- ments reached.' Yet there exists an alterna- tive. Countries can maintain their own se- curity, without contributing to an arms race, by concentrating on pure defense. This strengthens their own security, with- out posing any threat to others. This paper will explore these concepts, and examine to what extent Switzerland's approach to national defense corresponds to them.2 Section 2 differentiates between the two components of the notion of 'military strength': invulnerability and the capability to inflict harm on others. Whereas being invulnerable is a desirable attribute, posing a threat to others is seen as undesirable. The two are quite different, but they have long been confused, and this confusion, whether intended or accidental, has had dangerous * A preliminary version of this paper was presented at the Conference on Militarization, Development and Alternative Strategies for Security, Lysebu, Oslo, May 25- 27, 1981.

Section 3 discusses the dis- tinction between offensive and defensive arms, with a number of examples. Section 4 lists some non-military approaches to na- tional defense which will be part of total defense. Section 5 considers as an example the Swiss concept of general defense, and examines to what extent it corresponds to a desirable defense policy. Section 6 offers some concluding remarks. 2. Threat vs. invulnerability Boulding (1978, p. 33) states that he uses 'the word "strength" not in the frequently accepted sense of the ability to create strain through, for instance, violence, but in terms of the ability to resist strain'. He mentions that this ambiguity in language has created real difficulties in thought about these pro- blems. The confusion between the two mean- ings of strength or 'military power' as the ability to inflict harm on others and the ability to resist harm intended by others can be observed in the call by certain military circles for the acquisition of offensive arms which threaten the security of other nations in the name of 'defense'. But even some members of the peace movement have fal- len victim to this confusion if they advocate unilateral disarmament in order to reduce tension in the world. To demand that a nation be weak so as not to pose any threat to others is to confuse 'posing no threat' with 'being vulnerable'. To bring clarity into this confusion, a diagram adapted from Menger (1934) can help. He categorized people into those who tend to hurt others ('unhoflich', meaning literally impolite or inconsiderate) and those who don't hurt others ('hoflich', i.e., polite, considerate). He further distinguished be- tween those who are easily hurt ('empfind- lich', literally sensitive, in the meaning of being easily offended, intolerant) and those who are not easily hurt ('unempfindlich', in the sense of being tolerant). This yields the four categories shown in Figure 1. easily not easily hurt hurt hurting most others difficult character not most hurting pleasant others character Figure 1. Menger's categorization of people's character Menger then analyzes what types of people can get along with each other, and which cannot stand each other. He finds, among other things, that people who are considerate and tolerant can get along well with everybody. People who are incon- siderate and intolerant cannot even stand others of the same type, only people who are both considerate and tolerant. The following is a classification of na- tions, which is in a sense analogous to Menger's classification of individuals. It is to be seen as an isomorphism, not an anthropomorphism. I do not in any way imply that there are considerate or inconside- rate nations, only possibly their leaders. vulnerable invulnerable aggressive unsafestposture, most likely to become involved in a war non- safest posture, aggressive greatest contribution to international peace Figure 2. A classification of nations A nation is invulnerable if it has both the capability and the will to defend itself against any potential threat. Neither of these two ingredients alone is sufficient. Similarly, a nation is aggressive only if it both possesses offensive arms and also has</page><page sequence="3">Invulnerability without Threat 207 the intention of using them for aggressive purposes. But since intentions can change relatively quickly, and verbal proclamations of peaceful intentions are not always believ- ed by an opponent (sometimes with good reason), the only safe way for a nation to show credibly that it is not aggressive may be not to acquire any offensive arms. More about the distinction between offensive and defensive arms will be said in the next section. The most desirable characteristic of a nation in terms of contributing to interna- tional peace is not to be 'militarily superior' over others, but to be strong in terms of defense, and weak in terms of offense. Nations that are vulnerable often see the need to make up for this deficiency by acquiring offensive arms with which to retaliate against a potential aggressor. If a nation is so vulnerable that it cannot afford to have any fighting take place inside its own borders, it may feel compelled to 'defend' itself on the territory of others, preferably before it has been attacked. It may feel a strong temptation to launch a preemptive first strike. A similar tendency can be observed in individuals. People with vulnerable spots tend to be more aggressive against others, as a 'protective reaction'. For example, teachers who are insecure about their knowledge typically tend to criticize stu- dents more severely, in a preemptive way, to give themselves an aura of superiority and to prevent them from asking questions. People who feel comfortable about their abilities can afford to be much more tole- rant. Invulnerability is composed of many forms of resistance against power exerted by others over oneself or one's nation. Galtung (1980) uses the classical distinction between three forms of power: punitive, remunerative, and normative. Military power is one form of punitive power. Re- munerative power includes the offering of economic rewards to those who behave according to one's will. Normative or per- suasive power includes, among other things, praise and criticism, propaganda, etc. To make oneself invulnerable against these va- rious forms of power, there is a subjective and an objective component, as shown in Table I. For true resistance, both the subjective will to resist and the objective ability to resist are needed. Fearlessness may partially compensate for objective defenselessness, but not completely. Self-reliance is strength- ened both by the objective ability to provide for oneself, and by subjective modesty or self-restraint, so as not to be attracted by unnecessary material rewards offered. Self- reliant in terms of food is someone who can either grow a lot, or survive on little, or Table I. Forms of resistance against power resistance form of power subjective objective combined punitive fearlessnessa defensive capability indomitability remunerative self-restraint economic strengthb self-reliancea (modesty of wants, voluntary simplicity) normative self-respect,a knowledge autonomy self-conviction a These terms are described in Galtung (1980).

(1980). b By this is meant the ability to provide for oneself without exploiting others or depending on the good will of others, through resources and/or knowledge, skill, ingenuity, etc.</page><page sequence="4">208 Dietrich Fischer preferably both. In order not to be influenc- ed by others' value judgments a good por- tion of self-respect helps. But it is also useful to have more experience and objective knowledge than someone who tries to in- fluence one. 3 The six forms of ability to resist power mutually strengthen one another: Defensive capability enhances economic strength, and vice versa. Self-reliance and indomita- bility strengthen self-respect. Self-respect makes one less vulnerable to economic in- centives, less fearful etc. Together, all these forms of resistance against power constitute invulnerability. A complete system of pure defense should seek to strengthen all six forms of resistance against foreign power, but should seek none of the three forms of power over others. The next section takes a closer look at one form of power, military power over others which depends on offensive arms, and the objective ability to resist such power, provided in part by defensive arms. 3. Offensive vs. defensive arms The acquisition of armaments by a country usually has a dual effect: it increases its own national security4, and it reduces the natio- nal security of potential opponents. Arms that reduce the security of others without contributing to one's own security are cal- led purely offensive. Arms that enhance one's own security without endangering others are called purely defensive. Most types of arms can serve offensive as well as defensive purposes, and would be classified somewhere along a continuous spectrum between these two pure cases. In order to decide whether certain types of arms are offensive or defensive, it is essential to agree on what constitutes 'natio- nal security'. If that notion is taken to be as all-encompassing as to include 'business in- terests abroad', 'foreign raw material sup- plies', or the promotion of one's own reli- gion or ideology abroad, then almost any weapons can be claimed to serve'defensive' purposes. This is clearly a position that is untenable, since it leads to incompatible claims between different nations. What is typically considered a legitimate object of defense is the national territory. If nations only defend the territory currently under their control, this does not lead to war. Another object of defense may be national political institutions, or, at a more advanced level, national self-determination, i.e., the right to choose one's own political institu- tions, without the imposition of force from outside. For a national security objective to be logically acceptable, it must not lead to incompatible claims if several nations have the same objective.5 In the following discussion the objective of defense considered is to keep hostile forces outside national borders and to pro- tect the lives of the people living inside the national borders. 'Interests abroad' are not considered as legitimate objectives of armed 'defense'. Each nation will, of course, seek to pursue its interests in the world through diplomatic negotiations, mutually advan- tageous trade, etc. But such efforts must be based on voluntary cooperation with other nations, whose benefits are mutual. They must not be obtained through coercion, through the use of military force abroad. Under certain circumstances, there may be reasons for mutual defense treaties. These can help weaker nations to become better able to resist aggression, by forming an alliance with others. (Switzerland origi- nated as such a defense alliance.) But such alliances must reflect the desire of the ma- jority of the people in each participating na- tion. They must not be concluded with an unpopular minority that abuses them to keep itself in power. Neither must they serve the interests of one (dominant) nation at the expense of other members. Such alliances must serve purely defensive pur- poses, not any aggressive aims. One prob- lem with such defense treaties is that they can draw all the members of an alliance</page><page sequence="5">Invulnerabilitv without Threat 209 into a war that was provoked by any one of them, usually the most adventurous mem- ber. In this way they can expand the scope of an otherwise limited war. They can even increase the probability of a war, if certain members feel encouraged by the protective umbrella of the alliance to engage in provo- cative steps that can lead to hostilities, or even to commit outright aggression. Whether a defense alliance increases or reduces the probability and destructivenes of war depends to a great extent on the behavior of its members. It is not clear a priori. To expect every nation to have only territorial defense as its objective would be utopian and unrealistic, at least in the short run. This paper does not necessarily postu- late such an ideal state of the world. Rather, it seeks to outline a security strategy through which any nation that pursues it can live in peace, even if other nations have aggressive intentions. Taking territorial defense as the objective, typical examples of purely defensive arms are passive obstacles, such as tank block- ades or, in historical times, the Chinese Wall. Such immovable objects cannot be used directly to attack another country, they only impede a potential attack from outside. They do not in themselves threaten the security of any other country, but can improve the security of the country that builds them. A typical example of a purely offensive weapon might be a gunboat that used to be stationed in front of the capital of a weak country, in order to extract concessions. It clearly reduced the security of the country threatened by it, but hardly increased the security of the country of origin, which could hardly have been attacked by the threatened country. 6 Most arms that can potentially be used for offensive purposes, such as rifles, tanks, bombers, etc., can also be used in a defen- sive way, to attack an enemy after he has invaded one's own territory. Even nuclear missiles aimed at targets in an enemy's territory, which one would never want to use inside one's own territory, can poten- tially serve defensive purposes, if they are only to be used in retaliation against a first attack from outside. But it is not easy to convince a potential enemy that only defen- sive uses are intended as long as the objecti- ve potential for offense exists. On the other hand, defensive arms alone can never be used for offensive purposes.7 Here lies a certain asymmetry. Whether the acquisition of certain arms is perceived as defensive or offensive does not depend only on the arms themselves, but also on the past behavior of the country acquiring them. While some countries have not fought outside of their own borders for centuries, others keep intervening militarily abroad. Words alone proclaiming only peaceful intentions meet with understand- able scepticism. There exist also weapons systems that do not only reduce the security of potential opponents, but also the security of the nation acquiring them. For example, a highly sophisticated weapons system that is so delicate that it may fire accidentally reduces directly the security of the country possessing it, instead of increasing it.8 Such weapons could be called 'superoffensive'. On the other hand, there exist also 'superdefensive' arms, which increase not only one's own security, but also that of an opponent. For example, a fence which is impenetrable from both sides, or a peace- keeping force from a neutral party that separates two warring parties, can increase the security of both. As another example, a country may reduce its vulnerability from dependence on foreign energy supplies by the discovery of energy conservation tech- nologies or of safe new energy sources. If it makes such discoveries available to the whole world, it can help increase the ener- gy security of all countries. Yet another instrument that could in- crease the security of all nations would be a</page><page sequence="6">210 Dietrich Fischer increasing the security unilateral of others increase in disarmament I security of N I opponent /reducing Super- increase in own reducing / own / defensive security security / purely / \- defensive / \ Mainly / \ defensive /\ / / super- mainly \ / / offensive offensive intermediate intermediate purely offensive Figure 3.

The entire range from superoffensive to superdefensive measures can be represented in Fig. 3.9 A somewhat different definition of what constitutes offensive or defensive arms has been proposed by Quester (1977). Offensive he calls those arms which give an advan- tage to the one side which initiates fighting, which strikes first, whereas defensive arms give an advantage to the side which re- sponds to an attack and defends itself. A typical example of a defensive arm in that sense is a machine-gun post inside a bunker. If two hostile posts are facing each other, whoever ventures out first from his safe environment makes himself vulnerable and is likely to lose. Such situations tend to lead to a stalemate (provided there are no other, offensive arms). A typical example of offensive arms in that sense is a fleet of bombers on an open airfield. If two such hostile fleets face each other, whoever is up in the air first and can destroy the other fleet while it is still on the ground, is likely to win. Whoever hesitates and waits to see what will happen takes a grave risk. Such arms tend to precipitate the outbreak of a war in a period of tension and uncertainty. o10 In general, mobility favors the offense, whereas fixed emplacements favor the de- fense. For example, tanks are offensive arms, whereas tank barrages or anti-tank weapons are defensive. Bombers are offen- sive, whereas ground-to-air missiles are de- fensive. In the present nuclear age, one of the most destabilizing and dangerous delop- ments has been the increasing accuracy of missiles, and especially the invention of multiple independently-targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV's). This has raised the spec- ter of the unwanted outbreak of a nuclear war. As long as each nuclear missile carried a single warhead, and both superpowers had approximately equal numbers of missi- les, it was impossible for any side to destroy all the enemy's missiles in a first strike." The remaining intact missiles would have inevitably been used for a devastating reta- liatory second strike. This balance of mu-</page><page sequence="7">Inlvulnerability without Threat 211 tual assured destruction, however tenuous and mad it was, provided at least some deterrence against the initiation of a nuclear war. Now that a typical missile can carry ten or more warheads, the probability that ten independently targeted nuclear bombs can destroy an enemy missile in its rein- forced silo is close to certainty.12 If there are no other weapons of significance, then in a period of high tension, there is an almost irresistible pressure on both sides to attack first, because to wait would be suicidal. Whoever strikes first has a chance to oblite- rate his opponent and survive, whereas the one side that hesitates takes grave risks. At the present moment, this extremely dangerous situation of a mutual first strike capability has not yet been reached, because both superpowers also have nuclear sub- marines, whose precise location it is not yet possible to detect. Any attacker would thus have to expect massive retaliation from submarine launched missiles, and this not only deters a first strike, but also removes the pressure of either acting first or being left defenseless. But both superpowers, in an incomprehensible drift towards ultimate disaster, are now working feverishly on methods to make the oceans transparent. If submarines can be accurately located, and a single warhead can destroy a submarine that typically carries 160 nuclear war- heads,  then the pressure on both sides not to wait under uncertainty becomes enorm- ous. What could provide a temporary measure of tenuous security would be large numbers of dispersed missiles with single warheads, either ocean or land-based (or better both), so that no first strike can destroy them all. 14 This may help steer the world away from a nuclear war for a little while longer. At the same time, efforts are needed to build workable and las- ting international peace systems, which are not based on the threat of mutual annihila- tion. Little time is left to do something. '5 The tragedy is that the victims of this mad- ness would not only be those who perpetrate it, but many others as well, including neutral countries, who would be affected by radio- active fallout, even if they escape direct at- tack. Therefore, all have a right and a duty to warn against it and help in trying to prevent it. Table II contrasts some offensive and de- fensive arms. The main distinguishing fea- ture is that offensive arms pose a constant po- tential threat to others (at least in their own perception), whereas defensive arms cannot do any harm to others as long as they don't at- tack. Table II. Some examples of offensive and defensive weapons Offensive Defensive Tank Tank barrage, anti-tank weapons Bomber Anti-aircraft weapons, bomb shelters, radar warning systemsa Nuclear Shelters, dispersal of population missiles and industries, early warning satellites a True warning systems must be distinguished from radar guiding systems that can direct missiles into an opponent's territory. What is the result of combining defensive and offensive arms? Will the defensive or the offensive element prevail? When combined with offensive arms, even apparently purely defensive arms can become highly offensive. The result may be more offensive than either of the two components alone. For example, we have seen that bomb shel- ters alone do not threaten anyone else. But ifa country which already possesses nuclear missiles builds protective shelters for its po- pulation and industry, this can be seen by its adversaries as a preparation for a first strike. A country that does not have shelters for its civilians would never want to use its missiles in a first strike, for fear of retaliation. The missiles would serve only as deterrent against an attack from outside. But if the population</page><page sequence="8">212 Dietrich Fischer can be protected, the threat of retaliation is re- duced, and a first strike becomes conceivable. These considerations apply to any defensive weapons, if they are combined with offensive forces. It follows from this that one cannot look at individual weapons to judge whether they are offensive or defensive, but one must con- sider the entire combination of weapons and other defense preparations of a country, to decide whether the whole system is more of- fensive or defensive. To conclude this section, the relationship between offensive or defensive arms and the dynamics of an arms race will be briefly dis- cussed. 16 Let us assume at first that two hostile coutries, A and B, are concerned only with their own security, as governments typical- ly claim they are, and have no aggressive intentions. If country A acquires offensive arms, allegedly only for self-defense, coun- try B will see its national security en- dangered, and also build up its arms, to restore its own security.'" If the predomi- nant arms technology is offensive, B will need more arms than A to compensate for its loss of security, because offensive arms reduce mainly the security of others, and contribute little to one's own security. In response to that, country A will need even more arms to restore its security position, and so on. The only limit to the pace of such a mutually stimulated arms race is set by the two countries' economic capacity to produce or purchase arms. The arms race will put a heavy burden on their civilian economies, and reduce their economic growth. Clearly, both countries could benefit from mutual disarmament. But in the absence of trust and enforceable agreements, none of them can afford to take unilateral disarma- ment initiative without reducing its perceived security. If the available arms technology were pre- dominantly defensive, then the acquisition of arms by A would reduce the security of B only slightly. B would add to its arms to com- pensate for that, but less than A. This in turn would induce A to increase its armaments, but even less than B, etc. Soon this process would come to a halt. How do countries choose between offen- sive or defensive arms? In the absence of any mutual agreement, each of them acquires the arms that are 'cheapest', in the sense of adding most to its own security per monetary unit, regardless of the loss of security this inflicts on the other side. Under these assumptions, the discovery of cheap defensive arms could bring an end to an arms race. To illustrate this, imagine someone de- velops a very cheap and accurate antitank missile. A country that wants to protect itself against a possible invasion with tanks will then find it in its own best interest to acquire such anti-tank missiles, rather than tanks of its own to fight off an attack. But these anti-tank missiles, if their action ra- dius is sufficiently short, do not pose any threat to the other country, as long as it stays within its own borders. There is no need to match these anti-tank missiles either with tanks or with other anti-tank missiles to maintain one's own security.'8 One of the reasons why there has been so much emphasis on offensive arms in recent history may be that with current technology offensive arms are generally much cheaper than equivalent defensive arms. For example, a single missile can threaten thousands of different targets, and protecting all of them with strong enough shelters can be very costly. Whereas an aggressor can choose the point of attack and concentrate all his forces on that point, a defender must be able to withstand an attack from everywhere. This explains the saying 'offense is the best defense'. But if one takes into account the indirect effects of an offensive 'defense', namely the contribu- tion to arms races and the increased danger of war, then it may well be that the added initial expenses for true, non-threatening defense are well worth it in the long run.</page><page sequence="9">Ihvulnerabilitv without Threat 213 One result of this analysis is that it is much more profitable to export offensive arms, pre- ferably to both parties in a conflict, because this will lead to an ever-growing demand. Supplying both sides with truly defensive arms would make them both secure, and soon lead to a drying up of the demand for further arms. If two hostile countries are not only con- cerned with their own security, but both try to conquer each other, then they will not only be interested in acquiring arms to restore their own security, but also deliberately try to reduce the security of the other side as much as possible. In that case, even the discovery of cheap defensive arms will not bring an end to their mutual arms race. However, it is sufficient that one of the two countries is interested only in its own defense, for an end to the arms race to be achievable with a corresponding techno- logical break-through. For example, if someone could develop a cheap and effec- tive method of destroying missiles in the air, then no government would continue to build nuclear missiles, no matter how ag- gressive its intentions were. It would only ruin its own economy, without achieving any of its aggressive objectives. By shifting away from offensive to de- fensive arms, which do not pose any threat to a potential enemy, countries can make a unilateral contribution towards peace, with- out jeopardizing their own security. In taking such a step, a country does not have to wait for others to do the same, as is necessary in the case of mutual disarma- ment. 4. Non-military defense Galtung (1968) has shown how a country can increase its national security against potential aggression through non-military means. His basic idea can be summarized as follows. A potential aggressor will have to consider what gains he expects from an attack, and what losses he may have to incur. (Gains and losses need not be in a material sense only. They will also include prestige or humilia- tion, and anything else that a decision-maker values.) Similarly, he will evaluate the expec- ted gains and losses if he does not attack. Traditional armed defense concentrates exclusively on one of these four possibilities, namely on increasing as much as possible the losses of an aggressor through armed defense and retaliation (case 1 in Table III). The other possibilities have been neglected. One can reduce the gains of an enemy in case of an attack, if the population refuses to cooperate with a hostile occupation force, and offers non-violent resistance (case 2 in Table III). Industrial plants can be construc- ted in such a way that the removal of a few es- sential components renders them useless to an enemy, without destroying them. Stocks of goods, bridges, etc. inside one's own terri- tory can be destroyed in case of an enemy oc- cupation. It is important to announce that such measures would be taken in case of an occupation, and make them credible. Auto- matic mechanisms, which would operate in case of an attack independent of anyone's control, would enhance the credibility of such measures. The gains of a potential opponent in the case of his peaceful co-operation can be increased through scientific, technical and cultural exchange, mutually beneficial trade, co-operation on joint projects, etc. (case 4 in Table III). The losses in case of no attack can be reduced if injustices are removed voluntari- ly, if one does not exploit other countries, and if one does not give them the impres- sion that war is the only way out of an intolerable situation. One should never cri- ticise others to such an extent that they believe that only a military confrontation can restore their prestige. Initiatives to- wards a compromise by an opponent should not be represented as weakness'9 (case 3 in Table III). These four possibilities are summarized below.</page><page sequence="10">214 Dietrich Fischer Table III. Four forms of defense Attack Increase (1) Armed defense or losses retaliation Reduce (2) Non-violent resistance; gains industrial sabotage in occupied areas of one's own country No Attack Reduce (3) No exploitation; losses no'loss of face' for an opponent Increase (4) Scientific, cultural, gains political and economic cooperation; trade, diplomatic services Among these four measures, military defense has the disadvantage that it leads to mutual fear and to an arms race, unless it is purely defensive. Up to now, almost all arms races have ended up in a war. In order to increase truly the security of one's country, more emphasis should be put on the three forms of non-military defense. These do not represent any threat to other countries, and do not increase one's own security at the expense of others, but in- crease the security and well-being of all. They can make a real contribution towards peace, without any sacrifice in one's own national security. An important component of national de- fense without threat to others is to make one- self less vulnerable, and to become less de- pendent on others, i.e., more self-reliant. The storage of food reserves for periods of need and greater self-sufficiency in food produc- tion can reduce the potential suffering of the population if supplies from abroad are inter- rupted, and such measures do not threaten anyone else. If the population is widely dis- persed and if a sufficient number of fall-out shelters are available, a country can be less exposed to nuclear blackmail. All these mea- sures do not endanger anyone else. There are four levels of defense, listed be- low in order of decreasing violence: 1. Threat of retaliation against the civilian population of an aggressor, possibly by means of mass destruction (nuclear, bio- logical, chemical). 2. Conventional military defense inside one's own borders. 3. Guerrilla warfare in occupied territory. Harrassment of an occupation force by small, decentralized units with a high degree of autonomy. 4. Non-violent resistance and other forms of non-military defense. The first of these options should be exclu- ded, because mutual suicide leaves nothing worth being defended. The most effective defense may be some combination of the remaining three forms of defense. Diversity is a general method to re- duce vulnerability. If one component fails, others remain to continue resistance. A cer- tain amount of duplication or redundance provides much greater resilience and may be well worth the effort. 20 This principle also applies to forms of orga- nization. In a strictly hierarchical command structure, it is sufficient to eliminate the top of the pyramid in order to make the entire orga- nization leaderless and helpless. In a federal form of organization, which has not only ver- tical but also many horizontal channels of communication, it is much more difficult to create chaos. Another reason for combining military and non-military forms of defense is to preserve a democratic social structure, which allows for a maximum amount of personal freedom and choice, where no group imposes its will on any other group. For this reason, conscientious objectors against violent forms of defense should be permitted to contribute to their country's security with nonviolent methods, in which</page><page sequence="11">hlnvulnerabilit, without Threat 215 they believe. For the same reason, adhe- rents of nonviolence should not impose their views on the rest of society, and should admit 'conscientious objectors against nonmilitary defense', who believe that only force can effectively deter an aggression. The two forms of defense should be closely coordinated and support each other, not work against each other. The next section wil briefly examine how the Swiss concept of general defense compares with the theoretical ideas out- lined here. 5. The Swiss concept of general defense A good strategy should answer the question who should do what, why, when, where and how (Galtung 1979), and one could add, at whose expense. For the Swiss defense stra- tegy, these questions could be answered as follows: What is to be defended is the right to demo- cratic self-determination, the freedom of the people to choose and develop their own insti- tutions, without the imposition of military force from outside.22 This objective does not in any way infringe on the right of other na- tions to equal self-determination, and is thus a logically compatible, legitimate objective that does not lead to conflicts if other nations seek the same for themselves. Why self-determination is to be defended is out of the conviction that it is the best pre-requisite for individual freedom, com- mon welfare, and the possibility of further developing the state and its institutions ac- cording to the people's wishes (13). It also enables the citizens themselves to develop as human beings. It does not mean de- fending any 'anachronistic and obsolete concepts' (21). Who is to defend it is the entire popula- tion, in various forms. The army is a milita army that consists of about 80 per cent of the men between the age from 20 to 50 years, all those who are not physically or mentally impaired. They keep their per- sonal arms, ammunition and uniform at home, and most report for duty in case of an attack within a short distance from their home. The remaining population participa- tes in civil defense, medical services, in keeping the economy operating at a neces- sary minimum, and in non-violent resistan- ce if parts of the country should be occu- pied. 'Keeping out of war through defense readiness (dissuasion) ... is not uniquely a military task, but presupposes also a far- reaching capacity for endurance on the part of the population and the authorities' (423). 'The close bonds between the army and the population are a great asset' (542). Since Switzerland does not have a small profes- sional army isolated from the population, a military coup is almost unthinkable. When should the country be defended? Constantly, but in various forms, depending on circumstances. In times of relative peace, the main emphasis is on diplomacy and the offering of good services in the international sphere. In the event of an armed attack from outside, the army would play the major role in defending the natio- nal territory. In the event of an enemy occupation of major portions of the coun- try, guerrilla-warfare, sabotage and civil disobedience would keep harassing the enemy and prepare for ultimate liberation (544). In the event of an attack with means of mass destruction, the primary objective would be to ensure the survival of the population to the maximum feasible extent (23). Where does the defense take place? Mili- tary efforts are purely defensive and the army prepares to fight 'only within its own territory' (541). No retaliation against the ci- vilian population of an aggressor is consid- ered. 'Switzerland takes all its general de- fense measures in accordance with the pro- visions of the law of war and international law. This entails the prohibition of any re- course to indiscriminate conduct of war against the population of the opponent, even though in the atomic age, only the threat of the destruction of the opponent's</page><page sequence="12">216 Dietrich Fischer population seems to be an effective deter- rent' (512). An active component of the se- curity policy, aimed at the exterior, consists only of non-violent efforts 'to contribute to the shaping and securing of a permanent peace within the international context' (13). At what expense, to whom, does Switzer- land defend itself? The burden is carried by the entire population, mostly through regu- lar participation in defense exercises, within a comparatively moderate budget.23 In safe- guarding its own national security, Switzer- land does not threaten any other nation, i.e. its defense efforts are not at the expense of the security of anyone else. Other countries may not like Switzerland, they may feel en- vious of its wealth, but at least no country has a reason to feel threatened by it. The question still remains whether the current allocation of defense efforts and ex- penditures is the most effective one. Efforts in such areas of non-military defense as greater technical co-operation with poorer contries, on an equitable basis, and in con- flict and peace research, might well contri- bute more significantly to Switzerland's na- tional security than marginal additions to military hardware. Opportunity costs of present efforts must be considered. The biggest question is how Switzerland is to defend itself. A discussion of this will constitute the remainder of this section. The meaning of general defense is that it uses all legitimate means against all forms of power and all attempts at foreign domi- nation. I will in turn compare Swiss defense policies with the four forms of defense, in- cluding non-military defense (Table III) and the six forms of resistance to power (Table I). A brief glance at the historical evolution of the principles governing Switzerland's defense policies will follow, and the section concludes with a list of problems with current defense policies. The general principle guiding Swiss de- fense efforts is 'dissuasion', a form of in- offensive deterrence, which should make it clear to any potential aggressor that any possible gains from attacking Switzerland are not worth the costs. This means both that the costs to the enemy of an attack should be as high as possible, and the gains as low as possible. It also means that the gains from leaving Switzerland in peace should be as high as possible, and the losses as small as possible. These are also the four considerations underlying Galtung's prin- ciples of non-military as well as military defense. To maximize the costs of an attack, Swit- zerland maintains a strong army compared to its population. It is also prepared for protracted war and guerrilla activities out of mountain sanctuaries with reserves of ammunition and food. If the regular army should be unable to function, an occupation force would continue to suffer attacks from guerrilla warfare. 'The risks which a poten- tial aggressor must be made to perceive consist in the loss of prestige, military for- ces, war-potential and time, as well as in running counter to his ideological, political and economic interests' (423). 'Unilateral disarmament, as it is sometimes also de- manded of small states, would not increase the general security, but would rather redu- ce it, because demilitarized areas in strategi- cally important zones have a way of attrac- ting the interest of neighboring states' (3). To minimize the gains of an enemy in case of an attack, preparations are made to make industrial plants useless to an occupa- tion force, destroy goods in warehouses and stores that might fall into enemy hands (563), destroy bridges and railways in occu- pied territory, etc. The passive refusal of the population to co-operate with an enemy in occupied territory is also stated as an im- portant factor of dissuasion (426). To minimize the losses of a potential enemy from not attacking Switzerland, the main pillar is its neutrality policy, which guarantees that Switzerland will not attack another country out of treaty obligations with third powers, and will not fight unless it is attacked first. This means that no</page><page sequence="13">Invuhlerabiliti withiout Threat 217 country takes any military risk from not occupying Switzerland and trying to elimi- nate its armed forces. Switzerland also had a policy of refrain- ing from praising and criticizing other countries or governments. Foreigners are prohibited from making public speeches in Switzerland which might offend a foreign power.24 This is probably also the main reason why Switzerland has not yet joined the United Nations, because it prefers to avoid having to take a stand (even visible abstention from voting or non-participation in a particular vote) on controversial inter- national issues, which would earn it hostili- ty from one side or the other. Another means by which Switzerland tries to minimize other countries' grievan- ces against it in time of peace is by not exploiting any one country too visibly. Switzerland's economy does benefit sub- stantially from the repatriation of profits from Swiss owned enterprises in other countries, and from deposits of illegally gained money in secret Swiss bank ac- counts. But since these profits are spread thin over many countries, and Switzerland is of relatively small size, no country feels particularly oppressed by Switzerland.25 To maximize the gains of other countries if they leave Switzerland in peace, Switzer- land offers its diplomatic services, e.g. as a channel of communication between states having no diplomatic ties, participates in humanitarian actions and disaster relief, works towards the extension of internatio- nal arbitration, participates in international organizations, etc. (532). It also participates in technical co-operation with developing countries (although Switzerland's official development assistance is one of the lowest based on per cent of GNP), and in mutually beneficial trade. Generally it seeks to show to a potential enemy the value to him of an intact Switzerland. This means that Switzerland practices all forms of defense listed in Table III to some extent, both military and non-military.26 Let us next examine what forms of resist- ance Switzerland uses not only against mili- tary (punitive) power, but also against eco- nomic (remunerative) and psychological (normative) power, on the basis of Table I. Switzerland tries to maintain 'peace in liberty' through dissuasion of aggression, as just explained. At the same time, it attempts to minimize its own losses in case it is attacked, by making itself as invulnerable as possible. Besides the objective ability to defend itself, it also stresses the popular will to defend its independence. For the people to have the courage (or fearlessness) to defend their institutions, be it as members of the armed forces or as civilians enduring a hostile occupation and offering non-vio- lent resistance, the people must have somet- hing worth defending. In this lies the im- portance of a .just social order, the protec- tion of personal liberty and human dignity (21). To make itself as invulnerable as possible, even under the worst possible assumptions, Switzerland takes no chance. It has one of the most extensive programs of civil defen- se shelters.27 'Each inhabitant of our coun- try must have a chance to survive the war' (715). It stresses that 'the employment of weapons of mass destruction (atomic, bio- logical and chemical weapons) in a conflict cannot be excluded as long as any power possesses these weapons' (314). It further recognizes that 'the danger of a breach of international agreement is always present' (311), and that 'espionage cases, acts of sabotage and terrorism, also against our country, leave no doubt that the effects of the world wide struggle, which always could lead to war, do not bypass a small neutral state like Switzerland' (32). Effective protection of the population also reduces its vulnerability against blackmail (315). Other measures to make itself invulner- able, without threatening others, are pas- sive obstacles against tanks, and other de- fensive weapons such as anti-aircraft mis- siles, radar warning systems, etc. It also</page><page sequence="14">218 Dietrich Fischer possesses some arms that can potentially be used in an offensive way, such as tanks and fighter-planes. But it claims to use them only within its own borders, and past histo- ry makes this quite credible. To make the structure of leadership as in- vulnerable as possible, it states that 'our fe- deral system with its tightly woven net of organizations and domains ... overlapping in part, is here an element of strength ... in the case of a falling-out of the top echelon of a certain domain, only a relatively small part of the whole domain will be without leadership. Those still functioning domains .. may immediately step into the breach...' (64). In the field of transportation, 'the great density of our networks offers ... many al- ternative routes' (552), even when they come under constant attack. To make itself less vulnerable against economic pressure and embargoes from abroad, Switzerland aims at economic self- reliance in all areas vital for the survival of the population and for defense (552). This consists both of a cut-back of domestic demand (the subjective element) and of an increase of domestic supply when required (the objective element). The plan for self-reliance in food, which was pioneered by Fritz Wahlen, may serve as a good illustration.28 During peace time, Switzerland produces only about 60 per cent of its food consumption. In the event of a sudden and lasting forced interruption of food imports, four measures would be taken to insure self-sufficiency: 1. A reduction of daily calory intake by about 30 percent; 2. A change in the composition of food consumption, reducing meat and sugar consumption to about one third of peace- time use, and increasing potato con- sumption over five times, among other things; 3. A gradual increase in the area planted with food crops by ploughing more grass land, while the number of live- stock would be reduced, over a period of three years; 4. Until the cultivated area has reached its maximum level, stocks of food reserves would be consumed to cover the diffe- rence (see Figure 4). Sufficient reserves of non-perishable food are kept in house- holds (in civil defense shelters) and in mountain sanctuaries to supply the army. Similar measures exist or are planned for other raw materials that are essential for survival and for supporting military defen- se. For example, underground reserves of oil and gas are being built up, and the sources of energy are being diversified.29 Should Switzerland strive for autarky in important domains of the economy even during peace time? This would be unecono- mical, as long as imported food and other raw materials are cheaper. It is also unne- cessary, provided plans exist to increase do- mestic production in time, and fill the tem- porary gap with reserves. 30 Such a policy of self-reliance makes Switzerland invulnerable against economic threats, and does not pose any danger to anyone else. In this way, Switzerland can make credible that it has no need to raid, for example, Northern Italy for food in case of a shortage, since it can show that it has other approaches to meet a potential food emergency, despite the fact of the vital importance of food and its heavy depen- dence on imports during peace times.31 It would be in the interest of peace if coun- tries which depend, for example, on oil imports in peace time would make similar plans for energy self-sufficiency when ne- cessary, through reserves, plans for increa- ses in domestic energy production, and for a reduction of inessential consumption. This would be a real contribution to their national security, unlike any thoughts of raiding the Persian Gulf for oil, if the flow should be interrupted. That provides a very</page><page sequence="15">Invulnerability without Threat 219 Figure 4.

Trade must be based on vo- luntary, mutually beneficial exchange. While some trade for mutual advantage is desirable, dependence on trade can become a source of war. Therefore self-reliance promotes peace, by reducing sources of con- flict that might erupt in the outbreak of di- rect violence. At the same time, self-reliance is an aspect of peace, as the absence of ex- ploitation, i.e., structural violence. To make itself invulnerable against for- eign propaganda and rumors (an objective</page><page sequence="16">220 Dietrich Fischer form of resistance against 'normative po- wer' by an enemy, namely knowledge), Switzerland recognizes the need for a truth- ful and honest national news service, parti- cularly when being attacked. 'Manipulated information which tries to keep setbacks and negative developments secret ... may, after a while, have the opposite effect from that desired' (553). Also, a good general education for all is sought. The subjective form of resistance against psychological influence from abroad is 'self respect'. The Swiss population is taught to feel pride in their institutions. 33 Switzerland does not seek power over others, in any of the three forms. '... Switz- erland has renounced the use of force in backing its demands vis-ai-vis other states' (423).34 'To help prevent an automatic esca- lation through appropriate, (not excessive35) but sufficient reactions is one of the most important tasks if peace is to be kept in the atomic age' (412). Switzerland does not use economic em- bargoes against other countries to put pres- sure on them, nor does it try to influence the internal affairs of other countries through propaganda. How did this policy of armed neutrality evolve in Swiss history? Switzerland was founded in 1291 as a loose defense treaty between three localities (Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden) against attempts at subjuga- tion by the Hapsburgs. More localities, later called cantons, joined, and after having successfully fought against several expedi- tions by armies of the Hapsburgs, Switzer- land entered a period of active foreign military policy, conquering some territory, particularly to control passes over the Alps. This period lasted about two centuries. In 1476, the Swiss defeated the army of Duke Charles of Burgundy, who had attempted to conquer parts of Switzerland. They could have annexed the whole of Burgundy, but refrained from doing so. In 1515, two Swiss mercenary armies, one in the service of the French King and another in the service of an Italian Duke, fought each other at Marignano in Northern Italy, in a very long and bloody battle. This event created such an outrage in Switzerland that it brought about an end to the active period of Swiss military adventures abroad. Mer- cenaries kept serving abroad, but avoided fighting other Swiss, and Switzerland did not take sides in foreign wars as a nation. In 1847, during a civil war between prote- stants and catholics, some Jesuits called on the Hapsburgs to intervene in favor of the catholics. It never came to that, but the anger against calling on a foreign power to intervene in the internal affairs of Switzer- land went so deep that the Jesuits have been banned from Switzerland until today, despite periodic referenda to lift the ban. Since Napoleon's armies swept through Europe around 1815, Switzerland has not been drawn into any international war. It was able to keep out of World Wars I and II. Its relatively strong army may have played some role, as well as the fact that it does not possess any raw materials of va- lue, and has a difficult terrain to pass through. But probably most important was its successful 'demonstration of the useful- ness of an intact Switzerland to any poten- tial aggressor', as a banking and informa- tion center, and through economic coopera- tion. Such a position will be called immoral by some, who maintain that there are situa- tions where it is necessary to join the right cause and not to remain neutral. But it may be understandable from a small and weak country. Today there is a strict prohibition against service in any foreign army. Who- ever violates this provision is jailed on return to Switzerland, or loses his Swiss citizenship. So far, more or less everything seems fine with Switzerland's defense policy. There are, however, also a number of prob- lems. 1. Switzerland does not permit conscien- tious objectors against the use of force to prepare for alternative forms of nonmilitary</page><page sequence="17">Invulnerability without Threat 221 defense, or to do other forms of public service. The principle that liberal democra- cy should be defended in a compatible way with its principles (704) and that efforts should be made to overcome a 'growing disenchantment with the state by working together critically and constructively to eli- minate the causes of this malaise' (522) would lead one to expect a different treat- ment of conscientious objectors than giving them a mandatory jail sentence. 2. The command structure of the army is too hierarchical, despite theoretical em- phasis on the value of federal structures and 'tightly woven nets' of communication. The hierarchical structure of the army also dup- licates to some extent civilian hierarchies, with the same people occupying top posi- tions both in civilian and military life. 3. Switzerland exports arms, some of which are being used in combat. Although there is an official policy that prohibits the export of arms to countries at war, private firms sometimes find ways to circumvent this provision, for example by supplying third parties who then resell these arms. 4. Like probably every army, the Swiss army is plagued by cost overruns in pro- curements. People who do not spend their own money have a natural tendency to be less careful in what they pay. Most famous is the cost overrun that occurred in the purchase of Mirage fighter planes from France, which were modified at great and unforeseen costs at the request of the Swiss military. 5. Despite an extensive discussion of non-violent civil disobedience and other forms of non-military defense, no maneu- vers are being regularly held for such forms of defense. How can people be credibly ex- pected to practice them, if they have never prepared for such behavior? 6. The 1973 report stated explicitly that 'Switzerland can make its contribution... to a decrease in tensions and to the peaceful settlement of conflicts and disputes. Peace and conflict research activities constitute a part of these efforts' (422). In spite of that, no funds whatsoever have been made avail- able by the Government so far for peace research as such. In 1980, the Geneva International Peace Research Institute (GIPRI) was founded on private initiative. But it depends so far mainly on voluntary contributions. In what a state would our military defense be, if it had to rely on voluntary donations? At the 1978 Special Session of the United Nations General As- sembly, Secretary-General Waldheim ap- pealed to all nations to make available one tenth of one per cent of their military expenditures for research and education in the field of disarmament. It seems that such a sum would detract very little from our military efforts, and could possibly make a much more significant contribution to our security than military defense alone.36 It could help find new ways to solve conflicts without resort to violence, and to eliminate the causes of war long before hostilities reach a state that is almost irreversible. All of these shortcomings can and should be corrected. In spite of them, the Swiss defense policy, which tries to maintain peace and not to pose a threat to the security of any other country, seems overall quite desirable, at least when compared with some other current 'defense' doctrines. 6. Conclusions The main thrust of this paper has been to show that it is possible to make a contribu- tion towards peace without sacrificing one's national security by (a) increasing purely defensive arms and non-military defense efforts. (b) reducing offensive arms, so as not to pose any real or imagined threat to others which would make them in- secure and thus 'trigger-happy', and sti- mulate arms races. (c) making the structure of the entire socie- ty as invulnerable as possible, through decentralized federal forms of organiza- tion, dispersal of population and indu-</page><page sequence="18">2 2 2 Dietrich Fischer stries, economic self-reliance at various levels, and by creating an equitable so- cial order perceived as worth defending. (d) undertaking peace initiatives by offering assistance to other nations when they need it, sharing useful information, strengthening just international law, etc. (Unjust international law may streng- then structural violence.) The more nations take such a posi- tion, the safer the world is. If all coun- tries make themselves as invulnerable as possible and don't threaten one another, there will obviously be no war. Defense may be more expensive than offense, at least initially. But if one considers the consequences of the alternative, in the nuclear age, it will be well worth the price. NOTES 1. The ability to enforce agreements is by no means a sufficient condition for success, but without it, the situation is very difficult. For example, what would be the value of domestic laws, if they could not be enforced? 2. The entire paper is limited to a discussion of the prevention of direct violence, i.e., the avoidance of war and peaceful resolution of conflicts. It does not deal with the prevention of structural violence, i.e., the avoidance of exploitation and the search for equitable cooperation. The latter is also a very important concern, but it is beyond the scope of the present paper. 3. For example, advertisements for baby milk- powder found easy victims among mothers in the Third World with little education, who were misguided to substitute it for the much healthier mother's milk. The use of contaminated water has led to the death of many infants. Had the mothers been better informed about the health hazards involved, they could have formed their own independent judgment and would not have naively accepted the advertisements' claims. 4. This definition makes it necessary, of course, to define what is meant by national security. It may be difficult to measure'national security' in pre- cise quantitative terms. It will be related to a country's ability to avoid a war, and to its citizen's probability of survival in case of war. It will also depend on people's ability to maintain their own way of life, free from foreign domina- tion (otherwise living in a concentration camp would be compatible with national security). Even if the concept is somewhat vague, it is essential to deal with it, because it is so central to thinking about defense. The choice of concepts should be made on the basis of their relevance, not their elegance. Too often, intellectuals give in to the temptation of dealing with concepts for which statistical data are readily available or which permit sophisticated manipulations, but which have little to do with the fundamental problem to be addressed. 5. Unless there is agreement on legitimate goals of defense, the distinction between offensive and defensive arms becomes arbitrary. For example, as Patrick Healey has pointed out, if an imperial power wants to establish a colony to exploit cheap labor, and the indigenous population simp- ly runs away without offering any resistance, this may be regarded as highly 'offensive' by the colonizers who are deprived of cheap labor. The following quotation from Preiswerk (1980) also illustrates the confusion in certain people's minds about what is offensive and what is not. He writes 'Not to enter into trade relations has always been considered an offense. China made this experience in the 19th century. Samir Amin reports from the 1976 Nairobi Conference of UNCTAD: 'I have asked the representatives of the Soviet Union and the United States whether they considered the refusal by one country to entertain economic or commercial relations with other countries to be an "aggression". Both said: "Yes, it is intolerable!" The American explained that we are living in the same world and we all have to co-operate; the Soviet affirmed that to abandon international economic exchange would be a return to savagery. If one followed both, one would have to add to the Charter of the United Nations a new crime of aggression against civilization: "the refusal to trade".' 6. A modern successor to the gunboat is the aircraft carrier. It can only be deployed against weaker nations, who do not have the capability to sink it with a single missile. 7. However, certain defensive arms can be conver- ted relatively easily into offensive arms, e.g., if a ground-to-air missile can be converted into a ground-to-ground missile. To have a defensive system that is convincingly threat-free, such con- vertibility must be avoided. 8. According to the New York Times of October 29, 1980, no less than 3804 false alarms of a potential nuclear attack on the United States were generated by the NORAD computerized radar warning system during the 18 months from January 1, 1979 to June 30, 1980. So far, all of these alarms could be identified as errors in time, but 4 of them were serious enough3o that nuclear bomber and missile units were put on an increased state of alert. One of these false warnings occurred when a technician inadvertently inserted a training</page><page sequence="19">Invulnerability without Threat 223 tape, simulating a nuclear attack, into the live warning system. Other errors resulted from equipment malfunctions. If that system fails, it does not only threaten the security of the Soviet Union, but that of the United States as well. The Reagan administration plans to improve the reliability of that system, so that 'the Presi- dent could order a retaliatory nuclear strike against the Soviet Union, without risking an accidental nuclear war, after ascertaining that Soviet missiles are definitely heading toward the United States.' (New York Times of October 12, 1981.) But how can anyone trust the absolute reliability of such a complex system that can never be fully tested in the real world? 9. The vertical axis to the top in Figure 3 would correspond to measures which increase the secu- rity of others, without having any effect on the security of one's own country, a form of 'alt- ruism'. The horizontal axis to the left would correspond to measures which reduce one's own security, without affecting that of other coun- tries, a sort of national 'masochism'. The top left region corresponds to certain unilateral disarma- ment measures that increase the security of others, but may reduce one's security. 10. According to Quester, this model describes the outbreak of the 1967 Middle East war. 11. This would require near certainty that every missile fires, and the capability of hitting a small target with a reliability very close to 100 per cent, which is almost impossible to achieve. 12. If the probability that one warhead comes close enough to its target is .5, then the probability that of 10 warheads all miss is (.5)o10 or less than .001. If the probability of a hit is .9 for each warhead, the probability of 10 misses is (.1)io or 10-10. Even if several missiles fail to fire, cross-targeting still assures that all enemy missiles will be hit by at least one bomb. 13. A Polaris submarine carries 16 missiles with 10 independently targetable nuclear bombs each. 14. To prevent accidental misfirings from a widely dispersed missile force under decentralized con- trol, a central location should constantly emit a secret code that physically prevents missiles from being fired. Only if that central unit is destroyed, would control pass over automatically to decen- tralized levels. 15. Kenneth Boulding has calculated that if the pro- bability of a nuclear war is 2 percent per year, as some experts estimate, then the probability that there will be a nuclear war within 50 years is 64 percent, within 100 years 87 percent, within 200 years 98 percent, within 500 years 99.99 percent, and within 1000 years a virtual certainty. 16. A mathematical treatment of this problem can be found in Fischer (1981). 17. Fear of an opponent need not be the only cause of arms races. In some cases, the internal dyna- mics of a profit-seeking military industry, having close ties with the government officials who appropriate military contracts, can lead to a 'self- stimulated' arms race. It is also possible that an unpopular power elite pursues an arms race and seeks an external confrontation to rally support from a dissatisfied population against an 'external threat'. 18. Similarly, if it were possible to develop a particle beam that could destroy missiles, this might bring a temporary halt to the competitive build- up of nuclear missiles. However, if such wea- pons were accessible exclusively to the superpo- wers, this would strengthen their dominance over the rest of the world. As Galtung (1980, p. 190) has pointed out, the development of any new arms has a tendency to lead opponents to develop countermeasures, such as 'anti-anti-tank weapons', etc. But these are not necessary for defense, only if the goal is aggression. 19. For example, an unnamed Eastern European diplomat said in 1946 that if Russia withdrew her troops from Austria, this had to be seen as a voluntary gesture, and should not be interpreted as a diplomatic defeat in face of the Anglo- Americans (Rauschensteiner, 1979, p. 11). I am grateful to Erich Haager for this reference. 20. A good illustration of this principle was the Ho- Chi-Minh trail through which North Vietnam supplied the NLF during the war. It consisted of a very widespread and dense network of alterna- tive paths, and thus it was not possible to inter- dict the flow of material even with very heavy bombing. If one path was destroyed, there were numerous alternatives to choose from. 21. This section is mainly based on two documents of the Swiss Government, edited by the Zentrals- telle fuir Gesamtverteidigung (1973 and 1979), and on some personal experience. Numbers in parenthesis refer to sections in the 1973 state- ment on the Swiss concept of general defense. Both reports are available in German, French, Italian and English from the Zentralstelle fir Ge- samtverteidigung, 3003 Bern, Switzerland. All emphasis is in the original. 22. No country can, of course, completely isolate itself from the impact of what is going on in the rest of the world. Growing economic interdepen- dence has made most countries increasingly de- pendent on trends in the world economy. Ne- vertheless, one can seek to minimize one's vul- nerability even to nonmilitary forms of force, through greater economic self-reliance and politi- cal and cultural autonomy. 23. The direct financial military expenditures, 2.3 percent of GNP in 1979, are lower than the true costs to the economy because the government does not pay citizens during their military ser- vice. They remain on the payroll of their compa- ny. Also, such efforts as promoting food self- reliance for national security reasons, which re-</page><page sequence="20">2 24 Dietrich Fischer present a cost, are not included in the military budget. Even so, the costs of a purely defensive, but effective military posture are not excessive, as it has sometimes been claimed, in order to justify an offensive posture. Indeed, these expenditures are relatively modest, as an international compa- rison shows. As a percentage of GNP, military expenditures in 1977 for a selection of countries were: Israel 26.6%, Egypt 25.1, USSR 8%, Nigeria 7.3% (in 1975), Pakistan 5.8%, US 5.3%, France 3.9%, India 3.4%, Norway 3. 1%, Switzerland 2.1%, Brazil 1.2%, Japan 0.9%. The world average was 4.6% of GNP. Per capita military expenditures in 1977 were approximate- ly: Israel US$ 1002, USA $466, France $287, Norway $285, USSR $270, Switzerland $206, Egypt $125, Japan $55, Nigeria $34, Brazil $16, Pakistan $12, India $5. The world average was $88 per capita. (Source: SIPRI Yearbook, 1979. Population figures and world GNP were taken from the World Bank Atlas, 1979.) 24. This prohibition might well be lifted, since it should be clear that whatever any individual says on Swiss soil is not necessarily the position of the Swiss goverment. 25. Johan Galtung has compared Switzerland in this respect to a cat with 150 soft paws on 150 shoulders, whose weight nobody feels. If it had concentrated all its economic power on one country alone - for example, Austria - there would have been a liberation movement in Aust- ria and a war with Switzerland long ago. 26. Suppose that before World War II Switzerland had made itself defenseless by letting its army dissolve itself; had prohibited the use of German in schools in German-speaking regions, causing internal disunity and making itself look weak; had called on the German people through daily broadcasts to overthrow the murderous dicta- torship of Hitler; and had taken hostage the diplomatic personnel of a superpower, isolating itself internationally and losing support. This would have violated all of the above principles of dissuasion. It is doubtful, to say the least, whether under such circumstances Switzerland would have been spared from a war. Clearly the moral blame for an attack on Switzerland would have rested on Hitler's Germany, but that would not have helped Switzerland much. 27. In 1979, there were modern ventilated shelters for 70 per cent of the population and traditional shelters for another 20 per cent, although they did not exactly match the population distribution (Zentralstelle fir Gesmatverteidigung, 1979, p. 24). In 1974, at the peak, 748 million Swiss Francs were spent for civil defense, out of 3530 million expenditures for general defense or 21.2 per cent. Total defense expenditures represented 2.4 per cent of GNP (ibid., p. 50 - 52). Until 1980, 50 per cent of the cost of shelters in private houses was covered by public funds provided by the communities. From 1981, house-owners will pay 100 per cent of the cost of civil defense shelters. Every new house is required by law to have a ventilated shelter. (Private civil defense expenditures, which match those of the commu- nities, but are not listed in the report, have been included in the above figures.) A substantial number of underground hospitals have also been built. 28. Zentralstelle fur Gesamtverteidigung, 1979. 29. Such defense efforts, which do not pose any threat to others and are relatively invulnerable, need not be kept secret. On the contrary, they are publicly announced, and everybody is welcome to imitate them. 30. It is wise to keep some candles and matches at home, in case the electricity is interrupted. But it is not necessary to use only candles (or even to make them) for fear of an electricity cut-off. In this sense, economic self-reliance means the po- tential for autarky when necessary, not perma- nent autarky. 31. Even if Switzerland wanted to rely on getting food from other countries, if necessary by force, it is simply too weak to even conceive of such op- tions, as superpowers may be tempted to do, and it may have made a virtue out of necessity. 32. Recently, a bomb was planted in a New York Railway Station by the Puerto Rican Liberation Front. Nobody was hurt, and little damage done., But soon it may be possible for terrorist organizations to plant nuclear bombs. The most effective delivery vehicle may not be a rocket but a suitcase. 33. Perhaps a little too much, and this paper may look like yet another example of this. The recent youth disturbances in Ziurich have shown that not everyone in Switzerland is proud of all the present institutions. 34. 'At the same time, no doubt has been left concer- ning Switzerland's determination and capability to defend itself.' (423) 35. 'Nicht uiberdimensioniert' in the German origi- nal. That expression was omitted in the official translation. (Author's note) 36. Even such a modest contribution would increase the efforts devoted to peace research and educa- tion by several hundred percent. REFERENCES Boulding, Kenneth, 1978. Stable Peace.
