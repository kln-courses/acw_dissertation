Pp. xii + 250. Paper $23.95. In this study, Arbel attempts to synthesize several discrete bodies of historical informa- tion dispersed among various subdisciplines and integrate them with theories of myth and mysticism. Her aim is a "close literary-phenomenological analysis" (p. 3) of the Hekhalot and Merkavah texts, which is undertaken with philological scrutiny and methodological</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 469 scruple. Clearly demonstrating expertise with Judaica , A. quotes primary sources thorough- ly and cites secondary literature meticulously; and her engagement with broader academic issues is, on the whole, successful. Arbel appropriately recognizes that even a scholarly audience may not be acquainted with these texts, and so, in her two opening chapters, she provides useful maps for readers unfamiliar with the terrain. She also opens new conceptual territory through the use of "mysticism" and "myth" as academic paradigms. Hekhalot and Merkavah texts are com- monly described as "mystical," with certain units crossing over into the category of "magic." The extended discussion of these literatures as "myth" is a desideratum that signals A.' s most significant contribution. In chap. 3, Arbel introduces her discussion of mythopoesis. She considers not only how Jewish authors reused stories and images from the Tanakh but also how they drew from extracanonical sources, including heroic tales involving Gilgamesh, Utnapishtim, and Enme- duranki, and creation accounts featuring Bel-Marduk. Treating the Bible as "myth" is no longer the controversial position it was a generation ago, as attested by the work of Y. Liebes, M. Fishbane, and others; yet many still hesitate to do it. While exercising due caution regarding the transmission and intracultural transformations of extracanonical sources, A. argues vigorously for the continued legacy of Near Eastern mythology in shaping religious world vie ws. A helpful summation of evidence for the continued recital of the Enuma Elish in late antiquity forms the bulk of chap. 3. The emergent portrait of Hekhalot and Merkavah mystics is that they, like ancient midrashists, are bricoleurs , not only reworking their own traditions but also creatively integrating elements from other traditions into their under- standing of Torah. Arbel' s comparison of specific "mythological patterns" begins in earnest with chap. 4, largely devoted to human agents, and extends into chap. 5, devoted to God. In chap. 4, A. isolates themes pertaining to heroes and sages, organizing the comparison around motifs of otherworldly journeys (e.g., ascent on a cosmic pole, return to paradise, heaven's gates, tests and trials) and of transformation. In chap. 5, she turns to motifs concerning divine kingship (e.g., palaces and royal courts, thrones and chariots, the yoke of God's kingdom) before tackling the Shi'ur Komah materials that describe the features and fantastic measurements of the divine body. Following previous scholars, A. reads such bold anthropomorphism as figurative expressions of transcendent realities, so that "myth" is pressed into the service of an apophatic mysticism. Here A. 's approach, in bringing together the categories of myth and mysticism, works best. Arbel cautions that mysticism and myth "have no inherent connection" (p. 140), but her strongest insights come from the actual intersections of the two categories in her discussion of their synergistic effects. A. continually stresses the interiority of mysticism, while admitting that the texts themselves often describe not subjective mental life but an objective cosmos; and this is the more public dimension identified with "myth." A. is indebted to H. Jonas' s characterization of mysticism as inner experience that can be externalized as myth; alternatively, mysticism can be understood as an internalized, priva- tized version of myth. This potentially complementary relation between myth and mysti- cism is a compelling feature of A. 's study; however, although she acknowledges Jonas' s effort in chap. 2, she never explicitly assesses its utility. Arbel strengthens the case that Near Eastern mythology remained a viable part of cultural milieus during late antiquity. Some Jews made use of these stories, but which</page><page sequence="3">470 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 66, 2004 Jews? In the concluding chapter, A. addresses the social background of these mystics, not breaking new ground but providing a good overview of the scholarly debate. A. 's work highlights the promise and difficulty of integrating academic theories with close readings of ancient texts. The author deserves praise for undertaking an ambitious project that summarizes recent scholarly trends and points us in the right direction.
