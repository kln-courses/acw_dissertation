Shoulson's Milton and the Rabbis: Hebraism , Hellenismy and Christianity is a stunning scholarly achievement. The purposes of Shoulson's study are broad and complex, deeply involved in the complications of historical, religious, and literary stud- ies, but with compelling arguments and explanations, forcefully precise yet graceful writing, and a genuine feeling for the work he is about, Shoulson masterfully achieves his books every purpose. Milton and the Rabbis develops provocative and convincing readings of major episodes in Paradise Lost , as well as in Samson Agonist es, by reference to theoretical and literary analogies within rabbinic texts, and he establishes those read- ings against a remarkably detailed presentation of centuries of religious and cultural encounter. Also developed through the course of this book is a superbly sensitive por- trait of post-Restoration Milton who, like the rabbis of the fourth, fifth, and sixth cen- turies of the Common Era, had somehow to refashion himself "in relation to the reli- gious and political forces to which [both he and the rabbis . . .] had evidently lost out" (5). The topic of the rabbinic influence upon Milton's writings has had a ragged histo- ry, especially through the mid-twentieth century. Much of the earlier work was com- promised simply because scholars lacked expertise in Hebrew and Aramaic. Shoulson, however, is thoroughly adept in these languages, often supplying his own translations and, in sound midrashic fashion, frequently pondering subtle differences between re- lated rabbinic texts. Also often hampering previous studies was a doggedly narrow determination to identify the principal textual source or sources of Miltons Hebraic learning. Shoulson immediately and firmly states his reservations about such efforts: "I remain unconvinced of any direct link between a specific collection of rabbinic midrashim - in either their original Hebrew and Aramaic or in translation - and Mil- ton's inventions" (3). Shoulson then proceeds to identify what was perhaps the most misleading problem with the earlier studies. Crediting Matthew Arnold for recogniz- ing the error of enforced distinctions between the Hellenic and the Hebraic, Shoulson asks: When is an idea, a theme, an emphasis distinctively Judaic or Hebraic and when</page><page sequence="2">274 Book Reviews is it Christian? It is this precise difficulty - the fluid interaction between os- tensibly Jewish, Hellenistic, and Christian modes of thought, not only during the early modern period but at the very origins of rabbinic Judaism and Chris- tianity - that is at the heart of my approach to the question of Milton and the rabbis. What virtually all prior studies of the relation between the writings Milton and the rabbis have in common is a tendency to polarize Hebraic, Hel- lenic, and Christian perspectives or influences. (4) Clearly delineating itself against this background of earlier scholarship on Milton's Hebraism, Shoulson's book simultaneously and uniquely stands apart from those stud- ies by also establishing the facts of Jewish as well as seventeenth-century English his- tory and by contextualizing the work of Milton and the rabbis within that recovered history. The opening chapter, "Diaspora and Restoration," establishes the terms of discus- sion for the rest of the book, beginning with a valuable and straightforward introduc- tion to midrash, which most readers will probably need and which earlier studies of Milton s Hebraism have handled inadequately. The proof-text method at the heart of midrash, its dialogic nature, the inconclusiveness of midrash, the three forms of agga- doth , the intriguing petihtah or proem of many midrashim - such fundamentals, pro- vocatively applied in later readings of Milton s poetry, are deftly covered in this open- ing chapter, providing the theoretical underpinning for Shoulson s sustained argument that "the impulse to argue with God is one embraced by Milton repeatedly and bears a striking resemblance to rabbinical modes of exegesis" (33). Midrash must be under- stood not just as a form of rabbinical commentary, however, but also as the voices of rabbis writing within charged and ever-changing political and cultural environments. Shoulson explains that, once Rome became Christian, Christianity's dominance led Judaism to "develop a systematic set of responses to its political and religious losses," and that set of responses came to yield midrash (17). Among the challenges to midrash- ic theodicy was the concept of the Jews as the chosen people. As the new chosen ones, English Protestants such as Milton consequently struggled with their relationship with the Jew and "oscillate [d] between identifying themselves with the ancient Israelite of the 'Old Testamen≈• and regarding 'the Jew' as the quintessential misbeliever, Christian- ity's constitutive other" (21). For post-Restoration Puritans like Milton, however, the "hermeneutics of suffering" came to play "an increasingly significant role in the dia- lectical fashioning of English Christian identity in relation to its Jewish precedents" (27). Finally, glancing at Jesus' remarks about the sons of Abraham in Paradise Regainedy Shoulson closes out this introductory exploration of the similarity between Milton and the rabbis by saying: "I want to suggest that Milton needs Jesus to drop the Jews of the Diaspora so that he may embrace their mirror image, i.e., a politically and religiously disenfranchised restoration Milton" (39). While chapters three through five focus on Paradise Lost, chapter two sidesteps to Milton's earliest prose, the anti-prelatical tracts, and presents the vexed quality of Mil- ton's remarks as he engaged with the arguments about Jews, Judaism, and Hebraism offered by those supporting the hierarchy of the established Church. While this chap- ter, much like the first, is extremely challenging because of the depth and breadth of the points it covers, both are essential to a genuine appreciation of the later readings of the poetry. As the chapter title suggests, "'Taking Sanctuary Among the Jews': Mil- ton and the Form of Jewish Precedent" engages with the complicated issue of typolog-</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 275 ical associations between Christianity and Judaism, and as a young prose controver- sialist Milton is usually found denigrating Judaism. Milton reverses Pauls images, for example, when referring to the "ripe age of the Gospell" as opposed to "the infancy of the Law" ( The Reason of Church Government) , "a typological hermeneutic so extreme," Shoulson argues, "that it threatens entirely to elide the reality of the Hebrew Bible" (65). While most of Milton's citations of Jewish precedent in the anti-prelatical tracts are similarly derogatory, they also nevertheless continue to reveal the interconnections among the Hebraic, the Hellenic, and the Christian. Attacking a prelacy ignorant of Hebrew, for example, Milton, in another tract, describes the prelates' lips as "uncircum- cised." In his splendid analysis of the phrase, Shoulson argues that Milton here implies that "the English people are partly accountable for the success of these prelates with uncircumcised lips. As his career progresses, his role as both insider and outsider to English politics, religion, and culture" is one that "connects Milton with the situation of the Diaspora Jew" (51). Following the involvement of hermeneutics and ontology, Shoulson in this chapter also begins to lay out Milton's monism, which is so impor- tant to the poet's presentation of Edenie sexuality and which is rooted in rabbinic thought (72). Shoulson's subsequent three chapters draw this preliminary material to bear upon readings of Paradise Lost. "The Poetics of Accommodation" (chapter three) focuses on the celestial dialogue in Book 3; "Imagining Desire" (chapter four) focuses on the three creation narratives in Books 4, 7, and 8; and "'So Shall the World Go On'" (chapter five) focuses on the vision of human history in Books 1 1-12. Acknowledging the common characterization of Milton's anthropomorphic God as Jewish, Shoulson announces the terms for his analysis of the celestial dialogue: "I argue for a more complex relation between the poem's Hebraic and Pauline aspects, on the one hand, and its textual for- mulations of the Father and the Son, on the other. By writing through the personae of the godhead, Milton has imagined an alternative mode of human-divine interrogation that bears a striking resemblance to rabbinical forms of biblical interpretation" (94). When he juxtaposes the creation narratives of Eve, Adam, and Raphael in his fourth chapter, Shoulson develops the parallels and differences between divine and human creativity, and within that discussion he most provocatively considers the importance of desire and imagination to Milton as well as the rabbis, for whom sexuality, under- stood in terms of ontological monism, held both creative and corruptive potential. Shoulson's final chapter develops Milton's epic vision of history against the challenge confronting both the midrashic rabbis and post- Restoration Milton to redeem a his- tory of loss. As midrashic interpretation came to replace failed prophecy, Milton re- places the visual mode of Book 1 1 with the verbal mode, since for both Milton and the rabbis, as Shoulson explains, "The active, embattled engagement with the text describes the condition of exile. All interpretation, but especially the midrashic hermeneutic, posits as its final goal the unattainable return to a prelapsarian state" (236). And as "the rabbinic phenomenology of suffering" figured in rabbinic messianism (221), so Michael describes "suffering for truth's sake" as "fortitude to highest victory" (12.569- 70), but Shoulson also examines Milton's effort to distance himself from such "Hebra- ic phenomenology": Paradise Lost recapitulates the evolution of a messianism that rejects the aggres- sive military reassertion of political power. This is an evolution characteristic not only of Christianity but also of rabbinic Judaism. Milton nevertheless iden-</page><page sequence="4">276 Book Reviews tifies the wrong kind of messianism with Judaism, in both Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained , associating the worldly struggle for power with the law. He does so, I suggest, because the similarities between his own Restoration messi- anism and that of rabbinic Judaism of the Diaspora are so threatening to his own self-construction. (235) In an epilogue Shoulson discusses the Hebraism of Samson Agonistes , "whose theme is so ostensibly Hebraic and whose form is so deliberately classical" (243). Such contra- dictory impulses figure in the drama's development of the dominant themes of Milton and the Rabbis. Shoulson draws these conflicts to a sharply memorable and provoca- tive point when he quotes from Milton s preface to his tragedy: "Gregory Nazianzen[,] a Father of the Church[,] thought it not unbeseeming the sanctity of his person to write a Tragedy, which he entitl'd Christ Suffering (258). Shoulson's study is a book for Miltonists but also for all readers concerned with the development of religious thought. Meticulously researched and well documented, it will inevitably redirect scholarly discourse, but Milton and the Rabbis is also a book for undergraduates just beginning to learn to read, to interpret, and maybe to accept the complications that lead to the recovery of those truths contained in texts such as Par- adise Lost.
