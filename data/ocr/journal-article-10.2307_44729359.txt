ABSTRACT Computational simulations are conducted for several head impact scenarios using a three dimensional finite element model of the human brain in conjunction with accelerometer data taken from crash test data. Accelerometer data from a 3-2-2-2 nine accelerometer array, located in the test dummy headpart, is processed to extract both rotational and translational velocity components at the headpart center of gravity with respect to inertial coordinates. The resulting generalized six degree-of-freedom description of headpart kinematics includes effects of all head impacts with the interior structure, and is used to characterize the momentum field and inertial loads which would be experienced by soft brain tissue under impact conditions. These kinematic descriptions are then applied to a finite element model of the brain to replicate dynamic loading for actual crash test conditions, and responses pertinent to brain injury are analyzed. Resultant accelerations and Head Injury Criterion (HIC) values are computed and compared with non- traditional measures of head injury as affected by combinations of rotational and translational kinematics. INTRODUCTION The severity of head injuries sustained in automobile collisions is currently evaluated using the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) as specified in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 208. This criterion evolved from the Wayne State Tolerance Curve [1] based on a variety of empirical data from cadaveric, animal, and human tests, which presents injury as a function of effective acceleration and pulse duration. Over the course of this evolution, a more complete evaluation of dummy head impact kinematics was sought. Consequently, the current HIC uses the amplitude and duration characteristics of the resultant translational acceleration at the center of gravity of the head, and relates the severity of head injury according to the following function: r ~i2.5 1 '? HIC = max J a( t )dt ( t2 - ) (t2-tļ)tj where a(t) = resultant translational acceleration at head CG (t2 - t j ) = time interval maximizing HIC While the current HIC has been used as both an indicator of skull fracture head and brain injury, its efficacy in detecting and evaluating rotationally-induced injuries appears limited. Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI), is one such form of soft tissue injury that can result from the rapid deformations experienced by the brain, in response to automobile crash loading. This soft tissue damage affects the axonal and vascular structure of the brain resulting in subtle to catastrophic impairment of biological and cognitive function, ranging from mild concussion, or short-lived, reversible loss of consciousness, to long term coma or death. Estimating Damage to Soft Tissue. While soft tissue brain injuries commonly occur as a result of automobile collisions, they are, for a number of reasons, difficult to assess in a quantitative mechanical manner. Although not completely understood nor accurately predicted, the nature and consequences of DAI are now postulated as mechanical damage that is proportional to both the magnitude and rate of strain occurring in the brain. Axonal injury is thought to depend upon a number of factors including the region(s) affected, the level of strain induced and the volume of brain material affected. These factors are influenced by the direction and magnitude of applied dynamic loading. 3029</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1. Sectioned View of Anatomic Brain Model Mechanical Basis of Soft Tissue Injury. The basic mechanics of soft tissue injuries that have been postulated involve many biomechanical factors such as the biphasic nature of brain tissue, relatively stiff anatomic partitions, angular kinematics and other geometric features and constraints. Since brain material has a very high bulk modulus (300,000 psi or 2.07 MPa) it is resistant to dilatational deformation arising from hydrostatic stresses. However, the combination of its low shear modulus (2 to 5 psi or 13 to 34 KPa), interaction with anatomic partitions such as the falx cerebri which reaches deep into the longitudinal fissure, and tentorium which separates the cerebellum from the upper brain, and angular kinematics associated with the impact event provide the potential for developing internal damage to soft tissues as a result of induced shear strains. DAI is thought to be, in part, a consequence of this confluence of factors. To assess these effects, a computational procedure based on the above set of biological and mechanical factors has been developed. This methodology is considered adaptive in the sense that subsequent improvements in anatomic modeling, characterization of material properties and/or computational methods may be incorporated as they become available. COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE Since the direct measurement of microscopic strain fields is virtually impossible using anthropomorphic test dummies, a computational procedure has been developed to take advantage of the benefits of finite element modeling and to use actual dynamic responses measured in crash tests. Although additional efforts are required, this computational procedure may be used to estimate soft tissue strains induced by combined translational and angular kinematics in the actual dynamic automobile collision environment. The methodology includes the following principal elements: 1 . Finite element modeling of the brain including principal anatomic features. 2. Procedures for computing head kinematics and dynamic loading from the 3-2-2-2 Nine Accelerometer Package (NAP) located in the dummy headpart, for application to the brain model. 3. Assessing severity and extent through the Cumulative Strain Damage Measure (CSDM) [2]. We have applied this procedure to tests selected from the NHTSA crash test data base. These tests were selected to provide a range of impact conditions that result in well characterized headpart kinematics and dynamic loading. Once the 6 DOF kinematic response is computed from test data, velocity-time load curves describing the combined translational and rotational kinematics at the headpart center of gravity are applied to the CG of the brain model. The principal objective of this study is to apply a procedure for computing headpart translational and rotational kinematics from actual test data, in order to describe the six degree of freedom motion of the dummy headpart and to evaluate the development of soft tissue deformation using the CSDM [2]. This measure of deformational response can be associated with soft tissue brain injury. Finite element model. Figure 1 is a sectioned view of the brain model used in several studies to date [2,3]. The model was constructed with the primary intention of representing the mechanical factors affecting soft tissue strain as described above, and includes anatomic features such as the longitudinal fissure and distinctive sagittal and coronal geometry. The modeling of the brain/dura interface also permits the use of specialized boundary interface conditions, ranging from pure sliding to purely fixed [2,4]. The three component model includes a: (1) rigid skull-like enclosure (2) soft deformable interior component which uses a viscoelastic representation of brain material and material properties discussed above to approximate soft brain tissue deformation and (3) representation of the dura mater forming the falx (the tentorium is not currently represented). The model, which is discussed in more detail in [2,3] uses approximately 8,000 nodes and 5,900 solid elements, and was developed and run using the LS-DYNA3D finite element codes [5,6,7]. CALCULATION OF HEADPART KINEMATICS and DYNAMIC LOADS FROM CRASH DATA Figure 2 illustrates the location of accelerometers within an anthropomorphic dummy headpart, as used in NHTSA crash testing. The HIC is computed from the data of three accelerometers placed at the center of gravity along each of three defined orthogonal body axis. Additional accelerometers at non-centroidal locations are often added to 3030</page><page sequence="3">permit computation of rotational kinematics about the CG, forming a 3-2-2-2 Nine Accelerometer Package (NAP). As illustrated more clearly in Figure 3, the 3-2-2-2 NAP array utilizes two additional accelerometers offset along each body axis defined by three orthogonal planes intersecting and passing through the headpart center of gravity. The sense axes of the two accelerometers on each arm are oriented along the two remaining directions, peipendicular to the arm. Of the various accelerometer arrays configured for measuring angular kinematics, this arrangement was found to be particularly useful and stable for measuring headpart angular accelerations [8]. To utilize the additional accelerometer data available in the 3- 2-2-2 NAP, an algorithm has been developed to compute angular kinematic quantities [9] and to track the angular position of the dummy headpart during the crash event. This process computes body-fixed angular accelerations for subsequent integration, and uses a continuously updated description of the angular position of the body coordinate system, to track the angular orientation of the rotating, decelerating body coordinate system relative to fixed or inertial coordinates. An angular velocity rotation matrix is computed at each time step and used to update the position of the body coordinate system from its previous angular position. The time step and incremental angular rotations are limited to approximately 0.1 milliseconds and 0.1 milliradians/sec respectively, to replicate the acceleration profile and to minimize error buildup during the transformation process. An excellent discussion of the mathematical treatment of this subject is provided in [10]. With the angular orientation of the body coordinate system known as it rotates through space, direction cosines are then used to transform vector components of kinematic quantities such as body angular and translational velocities and Figure 2. Dummy Headpart Instrumentation accelerations from the non-inertial body coordinate system to inertial or fixed coordinates. This process is also useful for comparing headpart kinematic quantities from different tests, since a common inertial reference is provided. The transformation process also accounts for the spatial location of accelerometers within the NAP array. Since the seismic center of multiple accelerometers cannot occupy the same space at the CG or at any of the three offset locations in the 3-2-2-2 array, if these variations are not considered, spurious centripetal accelerations and/or cross products of angular velocity associated with these variations could affect computed angular kinematics. However if the locations of the accelerometer seismic centers are known relative to an ideal co-located position of accelerometers, these errors can be completely eliminated using relationships developed in [1 1]. The transformation process considers the non-ideal placement of accelerometers within the 3-2-2-2 NAP array, and utilizes an algorithm to compensate for erroneous centripetal accelerations and cross- products of angular velocity produced by these geometric variations. This obviates the need to calibrate the NAP package to compensate for these effects. A detailed description of the principles and implementation is contained in [9]. Since angular and translational velocities at the center of gravity with respect to an inertial reference frame, are of particular interest, these quantities are written to a single output file, for direct integration with the brain model finite- element input file. Velocity data is written in the form of 'load curves' specifying the velocity-time histories of the three translational velocities and three angular velocities with respect to fixed coordinates, as required by LS-Dyna3d. These quantities provide a complete 6 DOF velocity characterization of the dummy headpart' s translational and M Ideal Location of ^ Accelerometers at CG and on X, Y and Z Anns t, y Figure 3. 3-2-2-2 Nine Accelerometer Array (Ideal Locations of Sesimic Centers) 3031</page><page sequence="4">rotational kinematics and consequent momentum field for the entire headpart. Additional kinematic quantities in both body and fixed coordinate systems, are also computed during the transformation process. Since the accelerometer data reflects all dummy headpart impacts with the surrounding structure during the contact event as well as dummy restraint system interaction and dummy/neck reaction forces , replicating the 6 DO F kinematics of the crash test replicates the angular and translational momentum and resulting dynamic loads which would be experienced by the soft brain tissue under these dynamic conditions. The compliance of the dummy headpart skin is also reflected in the kinematic response. It should be noted that the skull is currently treated as undeformable in this process. Additional test instrumentation is under development to provide direct measurements of skull loading, and skull fracture models are being developed to assess skull injury and the influence of skull deformation on soft tissue strains [4, 12, 13]. However, since soft tissue injuries are known to occur without significant deformation to the skull, the rigid headpart assumption is probably reasonable for studying the general effects of dynamic loads on soft tissue, especially where low to moderate HIC levels are computed. The above approach provides a procedure for characterizing dynamic loads sustained by the head as measured with the body-fixed NAP in a relatively rigid dummy headpart and subsequently applying inertially based translational and rotational velocities to an analytical model of the brain to determine induced stresses and strains. In this manner, soft tissue strains can be computed in response to dynamic loads measured in the actual crash test environment, and the Ū FIXED (SIMULATION) VIEWPOINT (SIMULATION) T ~ nA» I - Track .x ('C Track V su» X WÄk ^ buck y/'/7 / SLED VELOCITY ' SIDE-MOUNTED CAMERAS (LaodR) Figure 4 Camera and Sled Test-Track Setup A-pillar Impact simulation 100 -i 50 - .

Application to Test Data. The NHTSA data base was initially reviewed to identify crash tests which contain NAP data, to define NAP data channels and to provide additional variables which imply distinctive headpart kinematics. Initial tests were selected with the primary objective of verifying the computed headpart kinematics, so tests which had predictable and familiar kinematics and good film data were of primary interest. Other major considerations were completeness of the data set and data quality (i.e., freedom from obvious measurement system error). 50 "1 40 - tri 30- ' Xaïis ^ J ' . «1 Ł. © 20- Ł. © ' .* 10 - ' Is 10 - I ' u S A / Z axis - - I g -10 - X OX) *.3 S CS &lt; g -20 - -30 - • Y axis -40 -I 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 Time (sec) Figure 6 Angular Velocities at CG, FixedCoordinates A-pillar Impact Simulation 3032</page><page sequence="5">Figure 7 - Left Elevation (Ground) View of Simulated Headpart Kinematics - A-pillar Impact Simulation Although comparing simulated kinematics with film data can be very difficult because of differences in viewing angles and perspective, it does provide a good qualitative verification of computed headpart kinematics. A complete comparison of film vs. simulation results is presented in [9] together with verification studies utilizing computed NAP data for known kinematic scenarios. The latter approach was used to verify results by developing load curves for comparing headpart final position using the transformation and simulation process and comparing this with a known final position in space. The computed NAP data was also used to evaluate errors which could be produced by non-centroidal location of accelerometers and to evaluate effects of transducer errors such as cross-axis sensitivity. Several sled-based crash test data sets met the above criteria and were selected for initial demonstration of the process as described below. A-PillariHead Impact Test. Figure 4 illustrates a sled buck placed on a sled track and rotated 36 degrees clockwise with respect to the sled axis. The A-pillar and the dummy headpart are approximately in line with the sled thrust axis to produce a 20 mph (32.2 Km/hr) head impact with the A- pillar. The vehicle was a four door sedan and a 50th percentile unrestrained HYBRID III dummy was located in the left front driver position. Since the initial velocity of the sled and, hence, headpart is zero, the null initial velocity condition was specified. Accelerometer data was input to the NAP transformation software to extract translational velocities about the fixed X , Y and Z axes as illustrated in Figure 5, and corresponding angular velocities about the fixed X, Y and Z axes as shown in Figure 6. Computed kinematic quantities are currently in English units for compatibility with the brain model. All quantities are with respect to fixed coordinates. This six DOF description of headpart kinematics was used to drive the brain model to generate simulated headpart kinematics. Figures 7 and 8 illustrate left and right side ground elevation views relative to the sled axis, in 20 millisecond intervals. Since the sled is being accelerated into the dummy, the sled velocity vector is from left to right in Figure 7, and from right to left as viewed from Figure 8 (i.e. from the passenger side). From these views, it can be seen that fully developed A-pillar Figure 8 - Right elevation (Ground) View of Simulated Headpart Kinematics - A pillar Impact Simulation 3033</page><page sequence="6">Figure 9 - Plan View of Simulated Headpart Kinematics A-pillar Impact Simulation contact occurs at about 40 millisecond, with the head facing up to the A-pillar and taking an angular orientation very similar to the A-pillar' s angle of inclination. Vertical headpart kinematics is primarily in the horizontal or lateral plane, as expected, due to constraints imposed by lower extremities of the dummy. A plan view of the simulated headpart kinematics is shown in Figure 9, also in 20 millisecond intervals, and indicates a head trajectory along the line of action of contact forces produced by the interaction of the sled-buck A-pillar components moving directly into the headpart. The kinematic trajectory of 36 degrees with respect to the headpart longitudinal axis is replicated, as implied by the sled test arrangement illustrated in Figure 4.

These three resultant acceleration curves are overlaid in Figure 10, and it can be seen that very good agreement is retained throughout the computational 180 -ļ - 160 ~ /k * 140 ~~ ' Raw NAP Data o Õ -ļor) _ ' '' Transformed ^ W "3 f " ' LS-Dyna Output w U «« ' &lt; w Z.

Corresponding HIC values are outlined in Table 1. In all instances, HIC is virtually unchanged, indicating that the accelerometer data has been transformed without affecting the resultant acceleration, and that the dynamic excitation applied to the model is virtually identical, in terms of the HIC calculation and resultant accelerations at the CG, to the actual measured test data. These differences are insignificant in terms of the resulting kinematics and should have a negligible effect on induced strains. Although qualitative in nature, comparisons of simulated angular and translational kinematics with film data were very good. CUMULATIVE STRAIN DAMAGE MEASURE (CSDM) CALCULATION FOR SIMULATED IMPACT As the headpart is subjected to these dynamic loads, the CSDM is calculated (see reference 2 for details of this calculation) for all the elements in the brain. Figure 1 1 shows time histories of the CSDM computed for the strain values of 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.1 1 and 0.13 in response to the dynamic loads applied in the above A-pillar impact simulation. Since the extent and severity of some brain injuries may be correlated with the mechanical strain of soft tissues, this computation of the CSDM may be a reasonable predictor of strain-related diffuse axonal injury. For combined translational and rotational kinematics, these results indicate that about 90 percent of the surrogate brain material has experienced the 0.05 strain level, while about 23 percent has experienced the 0.09 strain threshold and only about 2.5 percent of the brain has experienced 0.1 1 percent strain level. Although these results are considered relative and not absolute, the large differences in the CSDM values vs. various strain levels underscores the need for additional 3034</page><page sequence="7">1.0 -, 5« 09 - e = 0.05 5 , ' : S ~ 0.8 - / / « C / 2 .2 / S 2 CS .2 ^ « 07 ~ / / / CS ^ / WO ^ / ••= « 0.6 - / u "2 / u "s 5 0.5 - / = i ' •2 1 0.4 - / « 2 / fa E 0.3- / 4) £ ! e = 0.09 J w 0.2- / &gt; 0.1- ^..L=0JL ^ 0.0 ř- 5 ļ i ļ i ļ 1 ļ 1 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 Time (sec) Figure 11. - Evolution of Cumulative Strain Damage Measure Value A-pillar Impact Simulation Combined 6 DOF Loading work in defining actual damage tolerance threshold limits in the human brain. To asses the relative influence of angular vs. translational kinematics in producing soft tissue strains, two additional simulations were made. In the first, translational velocity components were set to zero such that the only excitation to the model was via rotational kinematics. In the second case, rotational kinematics were Turned off, and only translational kinematics were used. In the former case HIC is zero, since the acceleration is rotational only. In the latter case, HIC is unchanged, since the identical translational kinematics are used to produce results.

These results are summarized in Table 2 for each strain value. Table 2 shows that angular kinematics has a much more substantial influence on induced strain, producing CSDM values that are an order of magnitude greater than those for translational kinematics only, and less than those produced by combined translation and rotation.

It can be seen that the combined effect of translational and rotational kinematics results in a CSDM value that is about 50 percent greater than that produced by angular kinematics alone. This result is indicative of the sagittal rotation dominance of the impact and the resulting CSDM values are consistent with those found by Bandak and Eppinger [2]. The above results also suggest that translational kinematics alone, have relatively little influence on soft tissues strains also giving results consistent with Bandak and Eppinger [2]. These trends are in agreement with previous observations and theory about the mechanics of damage to soft tissue. 1.0 -ļ 2 0.9 - s » J 0.8- 2 s 0 7 ~ ¿í = ~ O 0.6 - u § ®'f °-5- I -s 0.4 - s ř ļ °'3~ ■2 1 0.2- e = 0.09^ ■2 e = 0.07-i ' e = 0.11 ~t ^ 0.1 - e ~ 0.05 ^ y e - 0.13-j J 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 Time (sec) Figure 13. - Evolution of Cumulative Strain Damage Measure Value A-pillar Impact Simulation Translational Kinematics Only 3035</page><page sequence="8">50 Z axis ^ - o ' v X axis . g s v X axis .

Translational Velocities at CG, Fixed Coordinates Side Impact Simulation Simulated Impact with Roof Side Header. A second application of the NAP transformation software was conducted using side impact test data. In this case, a sled buck from a four door sedan was mounted on the test track and rotated 90 degrees clockwise (similar to Figure 4) to study the effects of a head impact with the side roof header and/or B-pillar. An unrestrained 50th percentile HYBRID III dummy was located in the left front driver position and head contact with the B-pillar was noted in the test report. The impact velocity was 15 mph (24.1 km/hr) and a HIC value of 791 was computed for this test. This test was another in a series of tests to compare head impact response using production trim versus special padding. In this impact scenario, the dummy's shoulder region is closest to the vehicle side door which is being accelerated into the dummy, and consequently, should make initial contact with the side structure This would cause the head to lean or 40 -ļ X axis * 30 - a y- s W ' W « 5 - I « « 5 ^ --5 Z axis 1 --5 I 20 - I :"' / ,y-' - V-A ,y-' ' 'il 10- I ' 'Yaxis ìS ■ ;/ sa |! o ' «.io- V w -20 -j 1 ^ 1 1 1 1 1 1 « 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 Time (sec) Figure 15.

Since B-pillar contact indicated, the posterior region of the head should subsequently strike the B-pillar inducing a yaw motion of the headpart. Again, kinematic response should remain primarily in the lateral plane due to head-neck interaction with the lower dummy structure. Accelerometer data from the 3-2-2-2 NAP was again processed to generate the six DOF velocity data at the headpart CG, resulting in translational velocities in the fixed X, Y and Z directions, and three angular velocities about the fixed X , Y and Z fixed axes. These data are shown in Figures 14 and 15. From Figure 15, a sharp peak in the X axis (i.e. roll) angular response can be seen at about 25 millisecond, which drops off quickly. The area under this curve suggests relatively small angular displacements about this axis. Angular velocities about the fixed Y and Z axes are lower, but suggest larger angular displacements, in the range of 15 Figure 16. Simulated Kinematic Response Rear Elevation View Side Impact Simulation 3036</page><page sequence="9">degrees for the Z (i.e. yaw) axis and somewhat less for the Y (i.e. pitch) axis rotation. These data were used to drive the brain model as before, and to simulate kinematic responses for use in applying dynamic loads. An overlay of the resulting simulated kinematic response from a rear elevation view is illustrated in Figure 16, in 20 millisecond intervals . In this figure the vehicle is being accelerated into the dummy from left to right as shown in the posterior view. As appropriate for this test, the headpart moves laterally across the vehicle in the direction of the sled velocity vector, moving in a near horizontal plane. Shoulder contact occurs between 15 and 25 milliseconds and is a fairly subtle event to evaluate with available vehicle mounted film data, and contact with the roof header occurs at about 25 milliseconds. To illustrate simulated kinematics relative to vehicle mounted cameras located on the sled buck, a second simulation was made purely for kinematic comparison, by subtracting the sled velocity (i.e. the velocity component along the direction of the sled axis) from the transformed headpart y or lateral velocity component. With the lateral velocity component removed, comparison of headpart kinematics overlaid with the original position of the headpart can then be made. Figure 17 illustrates tiled views of headpart kinematics relative to the sled initial position between 15 -25 milliseconds, from a posterior elevation view. Corresponding film data is shown in Figure 18. Figure 19 is a similar tiled view which illustrates headpart yaw motion, in response to the B -pillar strike, between 10 and 35 milliseconds. In Figures 17 and 19, the solid lines illustrate motion of the headpart and the dashed lines indicate headpart initial position (i.e., stationary with respect to the sled buck, since the lateral velocity component has been removed.) In the second and third tiles of Figure 17, the subtle roll response of the headpart about the body x axis can be seen, reflecting initial contact in the shoulder region and subsequent roof header impact preventing further roll rotation. In the fourth tile, the headpart appears to be moving away from the side structure. Contact with the B -pillar and the resulting yaw response is best seen in the plan view of Figure 19.

The subtle kinematic responses illustrated in Figures 17 and 19 agree very well with expected impact response for this scenario as well as with vehicle-borne film data. Time histories of the Cumulative Strain Damage Measure for this simulation are shown in Figure 20, again for strain levels of 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, and 0.1 1 and 0.13. This is a less dynamic event than the A-pillar impact as indicated by the relatively smaller values of the CSDM. However on the basis of HIC (791 for this test vs. 854 for the A-pillar impact), there is relatively little difference in results. Using these procedures, the subtle kinematic response for this test is much easier to see when illustrated through computer animations that use a large number of individual states. As discussed in the previous simulation, it is also very easy to study the effects of combinations of translational and/or angular kinematics, to evaluated relative contributions to soft tissue deformation. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION: A computational procedure for estimating damage to the soft tissue of the brain, by replicating translational and rotational dynamic loads experienced during actual crash testing has been described. Data from a 3-2-2-2 array of accelerometers located within the dummy headpart are used to extract a complete 6 DOF characterization of the headpart translational and rotational velocity and momentum field. These data are used as input to a finite element model of the brain to compute Cumulative Strain Damage Measure values in response to dynamic loads applied using actual crash test data. HIC vs. CSDM - Translational vs. Rotational Kinematics. In the A-pillar simulations, it was shown that pure angular kinematics had a much more substantial influence on induced strain, producing much higher CSDM values for all strain levels, than for pure translational kinematics.

All of the above strain computations should be considered relative and not absolute. HIC vs. CSDM - Temporal Relationships. Referring to the acceleration time histories and CSDM data of Figures 10 and 1 1 for the A-pillar impact, it can be seen that the CSDM values of surrogate brain material for several strain levels continues to increase throughout the impact event, although at a reduced rate, well after peak accelerations have occurred. The continuing increase in strain is associated with post-impact angular kinematics and residual momentum effects. Figure 21 Surface Geometry for Developing Advanced Anatomic Brain Model While the CSDM value continues to rise over the entire post- impact period, HIC is optimized between 9 and 14.7 millisecond, or during a 5.7 millisecond interval. Up to this time, the CSDM at various levels of strain have only reached about 67 percent of final values. It is evident that the kinematic contribution to HIC occurs during a 5.7 millisecond interval while that for the CSDM is 95 milliseconds. While there is a definite correlation between peak acceleration and the steep rise in the CSDM, these results underscore that HIC and the CSDM are associated with different mechanical responses. HIC is primarily sensitive to the relatively stiff response of the skull while CSDM is sensitive to the relatively soft fluid-like behavior of brain material. HIC vs. CSDM Summary. HIC is sensitive to translational kinematics only, and does not directly consider angular kinematics, while the CSDM is sensitive to angular kinematics associated with soft tissue injury. However, when used in the above methodology, the CSDM considers the effects of both translational and rotational kinematics. The CSDM accounts for soft tissue brain injuries that are not detectable by the HIC algorithm. The results underscore the need for supplemental procedures to estimate the effect of angular kinematics on soft tissue injury. Future Work. The NHTSA data base contains a wealth of crash test data, much of which was conducted using the 3-2- 2-2 nine accelerometer array. This data base is being reviewed to identify a wider range of impact conditions including vehicle to vehicle tests as well as sled and barrier testing, and to identify tests using various restraint systems in current use. With this information, a wider range of kinematics will be simulated in the future. One interesting possibility to consider for vehicle-to-vehicle test data, some of 3041</page><page sequence="14">which contains occupant data from each vehicle, is the simultaneous simulation of headpart kinematics for each occupant. The study of these kinematics may be useful in assessing vehicle aggressivity and compatibility issues, in terms of detailed descriptions of headpart kinematics resulting from colliding vehicles. The transformation process described above is currently limited to 90 degrees of relative rotation between body and fixed coordinate axes, and is being extended to 180 degrees. This will permit simulation of a much wider range of impact kinematics for more dynamic test conditions. New magnetohydrodynamic sensors have been developed [14] which are capable of direct measurement of angular kinematics data, and could potentially replace off-axis accelerometers in the 3-2-2-2 array. However the transformation process and compensation for non-centroidal location of accelerometer seismic centers are still required, for characterizing velocity time histories at the CG. The distribution of predicted strain fields is also of concern. Three-dimensional graphical depictions of computed strain fields are anticipated as additional graphical features are added to post processing software. This will provide a means of comparing analytical predictions with studies mapping the distribution of damaged tissue. A detailed model of the skull, capable of predicting fracture, has also been developed [12], and plans have been made for measuring contact forces acting on the skull during impact [12]. Anatomic models with enhanced geometry and biofidelity are also planned, and depending upon pathological studies, may include modeling distinctive regions or lobes in order to better characterize the CSDM values occurring throughout the brain. Additional biomechanical features considered for inclusion in new model development include the tentorium, cerebellum, brain stem, bridging veins, and additional geometric biofidelity. Figure 21 illustrates preliminary work in progress, depicting selected surface geometry for use in developing an improved anatomic brain model. REFERENCES 1 . Society of Automotive Engineers.
