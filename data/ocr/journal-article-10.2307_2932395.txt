<plain_text><page sequence="1">Psychic Evolution. Darwinism and Initiation in Tess of the d'Urbervilles ELLIOTT B. GOSE, JR. T HE NOVELS OF Thomas Hardy have often been praised for their concern with the issues which the Victorian era was forced to face by developments in philosophy and science, and by social change. Although all of these concerns can be found in Tess of the d'Urbervilles, the most central to the book are Hardy's inter- pretation of two specialized developments in mid-Victorian thought, Darwinism and anthropology. The impact of the Dar- winian controversy on Hardy is well known, but his interest in the new science of anthropology has not been much remarked. Commentators have, of course, frequently noted his interest in folklore and superstition, but usually as an indication of the cul- tural and intellectual conflict which was so important in making Hardy the kind of Victorian writer he was. Victorian England was characterized not only by conflicts but by attempts at synthesis; the concept of evolution, for instance, was not confined to the study of biology but spread to the humanities as well. Its most obvious application was in charting the history and culture of man; thus, most of Hardy's novels deal in some form with the problems of social evolution. He usually goes behind contempo- rary problems, however, to what is always a key relation to him, that of man to nature. Specifically, in Tess he brings together the evolutionary view of man as a product of nature with the anthro- pological findings about early man's attempt to control nature through primitive rituals. Elliott B. Gose, Jr., is an assistant professor of English, University of British Columbia. [261]</page><page sequence="2">262 Nineteenth-Century Fiction On December 18, 1890, shortly after he finished writing Tess, Hardy made the following entry in his notebook: Mr. E. Clodd this morning gives an excellently neat answer to my question why the superstitions of a remote Asiatic and a Dorset la- bourer are the same: "The attitude of man," he says, "at corresponding levels of culture, before like phenomena, is pretty much the same, your Dorset peasants representing the persistence of the barbaric idea which confuses persons and things, and founds wide generalizations on the slenderest analogies." (This "barbaric idea which confuses persons and things" is, by the way, also common to the highest imaginative genius-that of the poet.)' Mr. E. Clodd of the quotation was Edward Clodd, an anthropolo- gist friend, and from references in Tess there can be no doubt that Hardy had been doing a fair amount of reading in anthropology. To begin demonstrating Hardy's use of it, we might look at a passage in the novel which indicates his interest in primitive rites. The house . . . was of recent erection-indeed almost new-and of the same rich colour that formed such a contrast with the evergreens of the lodge. Far behind the corner of the house-which rose like a gera- nium bloom against the subdued colours around-stretched the soft azure landscape of The Chase-a truly venerable tract of forest land, one of the few remaining woodlands in England of undoubted pri- maval date, wherein Druidical mistletoe was still found on aged oaks, and where enormous yew-trees, not planted by the hand of man, grew as they had grown when they were pollarded for bows. All this sylvan antiquity, however, though visible from The Slopes, was out- side the immediate boundaries of the estate.2 Hardy's contrast between the newness, neatness, and tameness of The Slopes, and the antiquity and wildness of The Chase is in- tensified by the mention of the "Druidical mistletoe . . . still found on aged oaks." He is referring to Pliny's famous description of the central rite of the Druids, who 1Florence Hardy, The Early Life of Thomas Hardy (London, 1928), pp. 301-302. Clodd's contention was a truism by 1891, being in fact the necessary premise for comparative anthropology. Hardy's observation had precedent too. In Primitive Culture (first ed. 1871), Edward Tylor, the father of English anthropology, fre- quently made the point. See for instance the end of chap. viii: "A poet of our own day has still much in common with the minds of uncultured tribes in the mytho- logic stage of thought." 2Since there are so many editions of Tess available, I will make my citations by chapter. This passage is from chapter v.</page><page sequence="3">Tess of the d'Urbervilles 263 esteem nothing more sacred than the mistletoe and the tree on which it grows, provided only that the tree is an oak. But apart from this they choose oak-woods for their sacred groves. . . . After due prepara- tions have been made for a sacrifice and a feast under the tree, they hail it as the universal healer and bring to the spot two white bulls, whose horns have never been bound before. A priest clad in white robe climbs the tree and with a golden sickle cuts the mistletoe, which is caught in a white cloth. Then they sacrifice the victims, praying that God may make his own gift to prosper with those upon whom he has bestowed it. They believe that a potion prepared from mistletoe will make barren animals to bring forth.3 It is to The Chase that Alec takes Tess the night he seduces her. And Hardy reminds us of its character in that scene too. "Darkness and silence ruled everywhere around. Above them rose the pri- meval yews and oaks of The Chase." Slight though this allusion is, it serves as a clue linking the scene with the pattern of sacrificial images which are present in the most vivid scenes in the novel. Before going on to analyze them, however, we must look briefly at the images which forbode Tess' rape. One of these, Hardy specifically has Tess interpret as prefigurative, the pricking of her chin by a thorn on the red roses given her by Alec (chap. vi). Earlier, he has Alec smoke a red-tipped cigar in front of Tess, and then offer her a strawberry: He stood up and held it by the stem to her mouth. "No-no!" she said quickly, putting her fingers between his hand and her lips. "I would rather take it in my own hand." "Nonsense!" he insisted; and in a slight distress she parted her lips and took it in (chap. v). Tess' passivity is emphasized heavily in the first two sections of the book and, as this incident indicates, is an important ingredient in her becoming Alec's victim. Although the victim of a ritual sacrifice and the aspirant in a ritual initiation can be easily dis- tinguished by intellectual analysis, in this novel we shall find Hardy tying the two together in an emotionally convincing manner. In 1887, three years before beginning The Golden Bough, James Frazer had published Totemism, an authoritative statement on a subject which Western man was just beginning to grasp. 3 Quoted by Frazer in chapter lxv of his one volume abridgment of The Golden Bough. Also quoted by Bullfinch in The Age of Fable (1855).</page><page sequence="4">264 Nineteenth-Century Fiction Although we have no proof that Hardy read the book, we may assume that by 1889 he would have known some of the rituals documented by Frazer, including a common form of totemic initiation, being "smeared with blood." The meaning of this ceremony, according to Frazer, is indicated by the following custom. Among the Gonds, a non-Aryan race of Central India, the rajas, by intermarriage with Hindus, have lost much of their pure blood and are half Hindus; hence one of the cere- monies at their installation is "the touching of their foreheads with a drop of blood drawn from the body of a pure aborigine of the tribe they belong to" (pp. 42-43). This custom of symbolic initiation among primitive tribes is imaginatively adapted by Hardy to form an important figurative pattern in the plot of Tess. It makes its appearance in the death of Prince, the incident earlier in the book which caused Tess to go to The Slopes. She had fallen asleep on a wagon she was driving to market with the result that her horse was run down by the mail cart. The pointed shaft of the cart had entered the breast of the unhappy Prince like a sword, and from the wound his life's blood was spouting in a stream, and falling with a hiss into the road. In her despair Tess sprang forward and put her hand upon the hole, with the only result that she became splashed from face to skirt with the crimson drops.4 The consequence of Tess' falling asleep is to deprive her father of his means of livelihood. Her guilt causes her to go to The Slopes where Alec, after telling her he has sent a new horse to her father, seduces her. Cause and effect on a symbolic level are also evident. Like the d'Urbervilles, Prince's name shows him to be of noble blood, though like them he is decrepit. The rendered image of his death by the "pointed shaft" is parallel with the covert image of Tess' rape by Alec. As indicated by these two incidents and the description of the slaughter of rodents at harvest (chap. xiv), Hardy saw that man's relation to nature was based on certain harsh realities and in- 4Chapter v. This scene is analyzed both by Dorothy Van Ghent in The English Novel: Form and Function (New York, 1953), and by Arnold Kettle, An Introduc- tion to the English Novel, Vol. II (London, 1953).</page><page sequence="5">Tess of the d'Urbervilles 265 exorable cycles which would necessarily be reflected in primitive rituals. Yet looked at more closely, Hardy's characterization of Tess indicates that rape may be too strong a word for what happens in The Chase. In chapter xii we find out that, "temporarily blinded" by Alec's "ardent manners," Tess "had been stirred to confused surrender awhile." In other words Tess is not merely a victim of Alec's lust, nor of Hardy's view of nature's ironic and fateful law of cause and effect; despite her mother's bad advice and her own physical weariness, she is finally responsible for her own nature and development. Hardy emphasizes her no longer having a peasant mentality like her mother's, and her having lost contact with the real meaning of natural processes. In fact at the end of chap. xiii he rebukes her for the Victorian moral con- science with which her modern education has provided her. Then in "Phase the Third" of the novel, Hardy puts her in a situation where her consciousness of being outside the social pale is in conflict with the unconscious "appetite for joy which per- vades all creation, that tremendous force which sways humanity to its purpose" (chap. xxx). In making this and similar state- ments, Hardy is affirming a certain attitude toward nature, an attitude that puts a somewhat different emphasis on the relations among natural creatures than did Darwin's notion of the survival of the fittest. The two views are not, of course, incompatible as Hardy's term "appetite" indicates, and I shall show presently how Darwin's concept is connected with the initiation ritual we have noted in Tess. But first I would like to distinguish between Dar- win's theory of natural selection and the older theory of evolution. Where Darwin's theory emphasizes competition for survival, the other asserts the connection of all life and leaves room for the concept of cooperation. Hardy was aware of both, but he saw man's progress as being tied to evolution. Of several notebook entries on this subject, I pick the most relevant. "The discovery of the law of evolution, which revealed that all organic creatures are of one family, shifted the center of altruism from humanity to the whole conscious world collectively."5 In the light of such a I Florence Hardy, The Later Years of Thomas Hardy (London, 1930), p. 138. Although Hardy wrote this particular version of his belief in 1909, he had written a similar one the year before he began Tess (Early Life, p. 294). And he is com- pletely straightforward in Tess itself, referring to the cruelty of the pheasant hunters, "at once so unmannerly and so unchivalrous towards their weaker fellows in Nature's teeming family" (chap. xli).</page><page sequence="6">266 Nineteenth-Century Fiction belief we can appreciate Tess' reaction to the burial of Prince. "The children cried anew. All except Tess. Her face was dry and pale, as though she regarded herself in the light of a murderess" (chap. iv). We might also notice how the idea of initiation be- comes associated with the idea of evolution at this point. Both beliefs connect the individual who accepts them with the past and determine his future actions. Noting Tess' emotional adher- ence to both, we may draw some interesting conclusions about her nature. Her reaction to suffering can be seen as a weakness because it leaves her vulnerable, but it can also be seen as a strength because it makes her aware as she had not been before. As we noted, Hardy felt that " 'the barbaric idea which confuses persons and things' is . .. also common to the highest imaginative genius -that of the poet." Tess' retrogression to anthropomorphism may thus be seen as a step forward in Hardy's conception of what I would like to call psychic evolution. The conception of psychic evolution is evident from many hints in Hardy's writing, but especially from a comment he wrote the year before he finished Tess. A 'sensation-novel' is possible in which the sensationalism is not casualty, but evolution; not physical but psychical. . . . [In the latter] the casualty or adventure is held to be of no intrinsic interest, but the effect upon the faculties is the important matter to be depicted (Early Life, p. 268). Tess is obviously such a "sensation-novel." Reading it, we must forget the sensationalism and melodrama (Hardy felt that "it is not improbabilities of incident but improbabilities of character that matter," Early Life, p. 231). But once we have seen what Hardy intends us to focus on, we can sympathize with Tess' struggle to advance on the scale of psychic evolution and we can appreciate the insight Hardy showed in connecting the psychical and the physical, in rendering the struggles of mind through evolutionary and ritualistic images. Although he tends to make a dichotomy between mind and body, he always ties them together, always makes us aware that Tess cannot separate her spiritual rapture from her position in the environment. Perhaps the scene where this is brought home most strikingly is the one in which she moves through the garden listening to Angel's flute. Despite the exaltation she feels from the music, her body is being stained</page><page sequence="7">Tess of the d'Urbervilles 267 by "sticky blights which, though snow-white on the apple-tree trunks, made madder stains on her skin" (chap. xix). The scene in the garden may be taken as one of many omens that Tess' effort to achieve psychic evolution will finally be un- successful. Although Hardy favored evolution with its sympathy and cooperation, he did not forget natural selection with its competitive lack of compassion. Man's aggressive nature must be reckoned with, as we have seen in Alec's seduction of Tess. A varia- tion on this active-submissive relation is given much later in the novel when Alec makes another bid for Tess on the platform of the threshing machine at Flintcoomb Ash. In response to his suggestion She passionately swung the glove by the gauntlet directly in his face. It was heavy and thick as a warrior's, and it struck him flat on the mouth. Fancy might have regarded the act as the recrudescence of a trick in which her armed progenitors were not unpractised. Alec fiercely started up from his reclining position. A scarlet oozing ap- peared where her blow had alighted, and in a moment the blood began dropping from his mouth upon the straw.... "Now, punish me!" she said, turning up her eyes to him with the hopeless defiance of the sparrow's gaze before its captor twists its neck. "Whip me, crush me; you need not mind those people under the rick! I shall not cry out. Once victim, always victim-that's the law!" ... He stepped across to her side and held her by the shoulders, so that she shook under his grasp. "Remember, my lady, I was your master once! I will be your master again. If you are any man's wife you are mine!"6 Although Tess says that once victim, always victim is the law (of nature), she has actually taken the first step toward denying the dominance Alec gained when he sealed their relation with her blood. When she finally kills him, she draws all his blood, and Hardy has her say afterwards, "I feared long ago, when I struck him on the mouth with my glove, that I might do it some day for the trap he set for me in my simple youth." The image depicts man's aggressive nature, for the trap was to catch a bird, as is clear both from an earlier comment of Hardy's that -she "had been caught during her days of immaturity like a bird in a springe," and from one of her accusations against Alec: "O, you 6 Chap. xlvii. After she descends from the machine, Alec says to her, in an image reminiscent of primitive sacrifice, "How the little limbs tremble! You are weak as a bled calf, you know you are."</page><page sequence="8">268 Nineteenth-Century Fiction have torn my life all to pieces . . . made me a victim, a caged wretch."' It is evident, therefore, that despite Hardy's hatred of cruelty and his hope that in man cooperation based on evolution- ary kinship would overcome competition based on natural selec- tion, he recognized the strong hold of the more brutal means of maintaining relations. In Tess Darwinian self-assertion manifests itself in an aggres- sive-submissive pattern which has its locus in the relations of Alec and Tess but is generalized to include society past and contempo- rary. In his commentary on the seduction scene earlier, Hardy includes a hint that retribution for past misconduct by Tess' ancestors might be involved. He immediately repudiates such visiting of "the sins of the fathers upon the children" (chap. xi) on philosophic grounds, but the connection of the aristocracy with aggression is based symbolically throughout the novel, as in her striking Alec with the warrior's glove. Another important use of it is in the legend of the d'Urberville coach, which is mentioned twice, but never fully explained. The first time, Angel tells her about it. "A certain d'Urberville of the sixteenth or seventeenth century committed a dreadful crime in his family coach and since that time members of the family see or hear the old coach whefi- ever-But I'll tell you another day-it is rather gloomy" (chap. xxxiii). Later, Alec adds a little more: "One of the family is said to have abducted some beautiful woman, who tried to escape from the coach in which he was carrying her off, and in the struggle he killed her-or she killed him-I forget which" (chap. li). Taking the relation between Alec and Tess as a modern repeti- tion of this legend, we can see that the moral of it will be that the victim can turn on her aggressor. That is certainly the outcome in Tess' life. The connection of the coach with the problem is evident: the legend is mentioned in the first place because Tess was bothered by the sight of the coach she and Angel were to use on their wedding night. A close carriage was ordered from a roadside inn, a vehicle which had been kept there ever since the old days of post-chaise travelling. It had stout wheel-spokes, and a heavy felloes, a great curved bed, immense 7 Chap. lvi. Ellipsis Hardy's. This is an early version of the passage, available in the Modern Library hardcover edition of Tess. The revised version is much less illuminating: "O, you have torn my life all to pieces . . . made me be what I prayed you in pity not to make me be again!"</page><page sequence="9">Tess of the d'Urbervilles 269 straps and springs, and a pole like a battering-ram. The postilion was a venerable "boy" of sixty-a martyr to rheumatic gout, the result of excessive exposure in youth, counteracted by strong liquors-who had stood at the inn-doors doing nothing for the whole five-and-twenty years that elapsed since he had no longer been required to ride pro- fessionally, as if expecting the old times to come back again. He had a permanent running wound on the outside of his right leg, origi- nated by the constant bruising of aristocratic carriage-poles during the many years that he had been in regular employ at the King's Arms, Casterbridge (chap. xxxiii). Just as Prince is the victim of the battering ram of the mail coach, and Tess is of Alec, so the postilion is of the "aristocratic carriage-poles." The development of this "boy" has been arrested at that point in the past when he was forced to submit to aristo- cratic dominance to be used as an object instead of a person. We might almost say that the postilion has undergone a ceremony of blood initiation which commits him for life, whether or not con- ditions change afterward and his position becomes anomalous. In a similar way, Tess in her youth has also been initiated by her blood bath from the victim Prince. Both she and the "boy" have become victims bound always to submit in the presence of an aggressor. As victims they belong to an almost sub-human order, one closely tied to brute nature. But Tess has the possibility of changing her state by marrying Angel. He himself realizes the symbolic import of their wedding, that after it Tess will no longer be a peasant, forced to submit to the toils of manual labour. He even decorates the bridal chamber appropriately: Tess looks at "the tester of white dimity; something was hanging beneath it, and she lifted the candle to see what it was. A bough of mistletoe. Angel had put it there; she knew that in an instant. This was the explanation of that mysterious parcel ... whose contents he would not explain to her, saying that time would soon show her the purpose thereof" (chap. xxxv). But the marriage is never con- summated, and the blood seal of Alec, given under the mistletoe in the darkness of The Chase, is consequently never revoked. After leaving Angel, Tess undergoes a reversal of psychic evo- lution. Having lost her chance of breaking free of Alec's seal, of becoming a fuller individual guided by Angel's high spiritual nature, she reverts first to the peasant level with her family, and then below that to the animal level after she leaves them. "There</page><page sequence="10">270 Nineteenth-Century Fiction was something of the habitude of the wild animal in the un- reflecting instinct with which she rambled on-disconnecting her- self by littles from her eventful past at every step, obliterating her identity." This reversion to instinct is imaged also in her re- enactment of the circumstances leading up to her earlier despoil- ment.8 In The Chase Alec had "made a sort of couch or nest for her in the deep moss of dead leaves." This time "her haunted soul" causes Tess to enter an upland plantation where "she scraped together the dead leaves till she had formed them into a large heap, making a sort of nest in the middle. Into this Tess crept." She moves herself back up to the human level after one of the most striking incidents in the book. She hears strange sounds and when daylight comes Under the trees several pheasants lay about, their rich plumage dabbled with blood; some were dead, some feebly twitching a wing, some staring up at the sky, some pulsating quickly, some contorted, some stretched out-all of them writhing in agony, except the fortunate ones whose tortures had ended during the night by the inability of nature to bear more.... "Poor darlings-to suppose myself the most miserable being Qn earth in the sight o' such misery as yours!" she exclaimed, her tears running down as she killed the birds tenderly. "And not a twinge of bodily pain about me! I be not mangled, and I be not bleeding, and I have two hands to feed and clothe me" (chap. xli). As her dialect indicates, Tess reacts as a peasant here, but this again leaves her a potential victim. Despite her rejection of Alec on the machine, she has to give in to him finally when her father dies, and her family is left homeless. As we might expect, her life with him, while materially good, is sensual, soulless. When Angel meets her again at the "pleasure city" of Sandbourne, he has "a vague consciousness of one thing, though it was not clear to him till later; that his original Tess had spiritually ceased to recognize the body before him as hers-allowing it to drift, like a corpse upon the current, in a direction dissociated from its living will" (chap. lv). He should be completely conscious of what has hap- pened, however. For the climax of his belated conversion had been his realization that "the beauty or ugliness of a character lay not 8 This parallel is noted by John Holloway in his article "Hardy's Major Fiction" in From Jane Austen to Joseph Conrad, ed. Rathburn and Steinmann (Minneapolis, 1958). Holloway also comments on the Darwinian motifs in Tess.</page><page sequence="11">Tess of the d' Urbervilles 271 only in its achievements, but in its aims and impulses; its true history lay, not among things done, but among things willed" (chap. xlix). Alec has subdued her pride and will, immersed them in luxury, but upon her meeting Angel again, that will comes to life. She stabs Alec to sever finally the blood bond between them. The image describing his fate is very similar to that used in the scene with Prince, whose death was almost directly responsible for putting her under Alec's domination. "The wound was small, but the point of the blade had touched the heart of the victim." Murdering him is the only way left to her, and to do it she has to regress as far down the human scale as Alec had in The Chase, back that is to the pagan Druids. Angel feels "amazement at the strength of her affection for himself, and at the strangeness of its quality, which had apparently extinguished her moral sense alto- gether" (chap. lvii). And the last important scene in the novel is given a background appropriate to Tess' state: "At an indefinite height overhead something made the black sky blacker, which had the semblance of a vast architrave beneath and between; the sur- faces echoed their soft rustle; but they seemed to be still out of doors. The place was roofless." They have reached the Druid's Stonehenge, and when Tess asks if it is a "heathen temple," Angel replies, "Yes. Older than the centuries; older than the d'Urber- villes." By chance or instinct she falls asleep on the Stone of Sacrifice. "Her breathing now was quick and small, like that of a lesser creature than a woman.... Soon the light was strong, and a ray shone upon her unconscious form, peering under her eyelids and waking her" (chap. lviii). She is taken away by the repre- sentatives of society, who have surrounded her while she slept. A combination of social pressure, mischance, and willfulness have put Tess in a position where she can gain temporary happi- ness only by discarding civilized self-restraint. As a result of her blood sacrifice of Alec, her own death has become inevitable. Although Tess was obeying the kinship-through-evolution code when she put the pheasants out of their misery, in brutally freeing herself from a brute relationship, she moved down the scale of psychic evolution to the primitive level. Seen, therefore, in the perspective of the patterns Hardy has constructed, her death is called for by the dark law of man's earliest relation to nature as much as by any unenlightened social law. And set in the elemental</page><page sequence="12">272 Nineteenth-Century Fiction grandeur of Stonehenge, it would have been a fitting primitive sacrifice. Early in the novel Hardy had speculated whether "at the acme and summit of the human progress [human relations] will be corrected by a finer intuition, a closer interaction of the social machinery than that which now jolts us around and along; but such completeness is not to be prophesied, or even conceived as possible" (chap. v). This analysis, adequate enough as a statement of the central problems in Jude the Obscure, refers to only a part of what actually goes on in Tess of the d'Urbervilles. Through his feeling for man's place in the evolutionary scale of progress and regress, and his insight into the ritual necessities of man's relation to nature, Hardy makes Tess appealing not as a victim of society but as a human being caught in the ebb and flow of history, environment, and self.</page></plain_text>
