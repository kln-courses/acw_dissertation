<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALFARABI'S FIVE CHAPTERS ON LOGIC HARRY BLUMBERG I. The Arabic Text When Prantl wrote the section on Alfarabi in his Geschichte der Logik,' the only primary sources available to him were the few quotations from Alfarabi to be found in the works of the scholastics, Albertus Magnus and Vincent of Beauvais, and Schmoelders' Latin translation of two of Alfarabi's treatises.2 Since then, Steinschneider published his exhaustive monograph on the life and works of Alfarabi and thereby stimulated the editing of a'number of the Arabic philosopher's writings.3 On the logic, however, none of Alfarabi's works has been published up to date. Historians of philosophy usually note the deplorable fact that all of Alfarabi's writings on logic have been lost in the I Cf.

They are the treatises, Fusul yuhtaju ilaiha fi .ina'at al-mantik and al-jaul fi shara'it al-yakin, both of which have been preserved in a unique text in Hebrew characters and are to be found in Paris, Cod. Heb. 1008.5 The first of these treatises has been made the subject of the present study. On the whole, so few of the many works of Alfarabi have come down to us that any new text must be considered a welcome addition to our too limited fund of infor- mation concerning the first of the outstanding Muslim philoso- phers. We have therefore prepared a critical edition of the Fusul which we hope to publish in a separate volume. Munk, in his essay on Alfarabi, mentions the Fusul only inci- dentally, without pausing to describe the work.6 Steinschneider on the other hand, gives some description of it, suggesting that it may have been the first chapter of Alfarabi's commentary on the Categories, because the first chapter happens to be missing in the extant Hebrew translations of the commentary.7 But an analysis of the contents of the Fusul indicates that Steinschneider did not hit the mark this time. Of the five chapters of the Fusul, only chapters 1 and 4 and a part of chapter 5 show any connec- tion with the subject matter of the Categories.8 The remaining chapters draw for their material upon such diverse works of Aristotle as the Metaphysics, the Poetics, the De Interpretatione, 4 Cf. Encyclopedia Judaica, Alfarabi. The logical works of Alfarabi owe their preservation to the numerous Hebrew translations that were made. Steinschneider gives a comprehensive list of them in his Hebr. Ubersetzungen, pp. 43 ff. s Munk and Steinschneider have already called attention to the existence of these two treatises. Cf. Munk, Melanges de Philosphie Juive et Arabe, pp. 351, 352 n. 1, and Steinschneider, lbersetzungen p. 43 and his Alfarabi, pp. 15, 16. 6 Cf. above, note 5. 7 Cf. Steinschneider, Alfarabi, loc. cit. 8 Ch. 4 of the Fusul discusses the five senses of the term, prior, and is mani- festly based upon the Categories, Ch. 12. The first part of Ch. 5 deals with simple and compound forms of speech and is taken partly from the Categories, Ch. 2, 116 [2]</page><page sequence="3">[3] ALFARABI'S FIVE CHAPTERS ON LOGIC 117 the Posterior Analytics, and the Topics. This would seem to indi- cate that the Fusul was an independent compilation, not intended as a commentary on any particular work of Aristotle. Yet none of the Arab biographers or bibliographers records this work under separate title.9 The argument from silence is a strong one, but still we cannot simply assume that the present treatise es- caped the notice of all of the Arabic biographers for three cen- turies and then suddenly reappeared among the Jews. The identity of the text must rather be sought in the internal evidence offered and in the peculiar circumstances under which Alfarabi used to edit his works. Ibn Khallikan, in his biograph- ies, relates that Alfarabi was accustomed to writing most of his works on loose leaves and very few in quires, and for that reason nearly all of his works assumed the form of detached chapters and notes, some of them existing in fragments or left altogether unfinished.1o This is exactly the condition of our text. Each chapter is a detached and independent piece of work and there is no continuity or sequence between one chapter and the next. Furthermore, the last chapter remains unfinished toward the end, and each of the five chapters contains annotations from later hands, which have been incorporated by mistake in the body of the text." We must therefore conclude that our present 9 Ibn Nadim's Fihrist, compiled about forty years after Alfarabi's death (950 A.D.), and the oldest bibliographical work published, mentions only four works of Alfarabi on the Organon, none of which bears the title of this book. See Fihrist, ed. Fliigel, p. 26. Two centuries later, Alkifti mentions twenty titles on logic ascribed to Alfarabi, but only one of them manifests any kind of resemblance to the title of the present work: 3aLJ l 4l ' Jl 43J .A" See Allifti, TariF al-hukama, ed. J. Lippert, p. 278. Ibn abi Usaibiya's bio- graphical dictionary, published a century after Alkifti's, records a score of titles under Alfarabi, but none agreeing with the one under consideration. See Ibn abi USaibiya, ed. A. Miiller, v. 1 pp. 138, 139. 10 Cf. de Slane's translation of Ibn Khallikan's, jL.cVl cLUj, v. 3, p. 309. " Toward the end of Ch. 5, the text passes abruptly from the definition of the term, J , to that of -.- and ,J. Definitions of the predicables -. and ~ ;, are omitted. The text is apparently incomplete. Besides, we have counted eight passages that are erroneously inserted in the text proper.</page><page sequence="4">118 BLUMBERG [4] text constituted a few of those detached notes which Ibn Khal- likan was referring to in his account of Alfarabi's method of literary composition, and that some time before the present text reached Jewish students of philosophy in western Europe, the five chapters were arbitrarily pieced together and were just as arbitrarily given the title, Fusul yuttaju, etc.12 Beyond that, we can only venture the guess that the five chapters may have originally belonged to the commentary on the Organon, which commentary a century or so later fell into disuse and was re- placed by the more comprehensive works of Avicenna and Averroes.I3 Of one thing we are certain, however, and that is that there existed at least another copy of the original text of the Fusul besides our own, for none of the extant Hebrew translations examined follows our present Arabic text very closely, all of them showing the earmarks of a different copy.'4 Although the colophon of our Arabic text is silent about the name of the copyist or the date, we can infer from the striking similarity in hand- writing between the previous text in the codex and our own that the copyist must have been one and the same person for both texts. The previous text, that of Averroes' Epitome of the Organon in Hebrew characters, bears the signature of the copy- ist, Ezra ben Shelomo Gatigno of Saragossa, and also the date 12 The titles of the Hebrew translations of the Fusul, without exception, point to an Arabic title quite different from our own. Reconstructed, it would read somewhat as follows: 4j' _ 1 3. 'kz tA v 1 J JJai j3l l etI[a ~j C~LJl. Cf. below, note 16. I3 Ibn Khallikan mentions Avicenna's dependence upon Alfarabi in this wise: "No Musulman ever reached in the philosophical sciences the same rank as he (Alfarabi), and it was by the study of his writings and the imitation of his style that Avicenna attained proficiency and rendered his own works so useful." Cf. de Slane, op. cit. v. 3 p. 307. A similar high regard for Alfarabi's works is expressed by Maimonides in his letter to Samuel ibn Tibbon. See Kobez Teshubot ha-Rambam, III, 28. '4 As for the Vatican Hebrew fragment, Cod. Ebr. 49, it is not a transla- tion but only a paraphrase</page><page sequence="5">[5] ALFARABI'S FIVE CHAPTERS ON LOGIC 119 of the completion of the copy, the third of Tishri, 5117 (1356 A.D.).I5 We may therefore assume with a degree of certainty that the present text of Alfarabi was likewise copied by Ezra Gatigno about the middle of the fourteenth century. II. Hebrew Translations and Supercommentaries There can be no doubt that the Fusul enjoyed some popularity among the Jews, for there are seven copies of Hebrew trans- lations of the work that have come down to us. Steinschneider is of the opinion that these copies represent four different ver- sions, viz. 1) Paris, Ms. Heb. 929, Jewish Theol. Sem. Steinsch. 22; 2) Bodleian, Ms. Heb. 1352.4, Munich 297, Turin 211, and Vatican 49; 3) Munich 307; 4) Solomon ibn Ayyub's version preserved in excerpts of Abraham Bedersi's .Hotam Toknit. But this enumeration of four versions is incorrect, for, upon comparison, we have found thht the Vatican copy differs from all the other versions and also bears a different title. Its transla- tion is free to the extent of being a paraphrase. There are thus altogether five Hebrew versions.'6 With the exception of Solo- mon ibn Ayyub's excerpts, only one of these five versions records the name of the translator, viz. that contained in the Paris Ms. Its colophon reads that the work "was translated by the great 's Cf. Paris Cod. Heb. 1008, which contains: 1) Averroes' Epitome of the Organon, fol. lv-97r; 2) the Kaul fi Shara'it al-Yatin of Alfarabi, fol. 97r- lOOv; 3) the Fusul, fol. 100v-103v. The Paris catalogue records the name of the copyist of Averroes' Epitome of the Organon as Ezra ben Solomon Gatnin. The date would seem to indicate that this is the same Ezra Gatigno who wrote the supercommentary to Abraham ibn Ezra's commentary on the Pentateuch. Cf. Steinschneider, Hebr. Obersetzungen, p. 436. I6 The titles of the five Hebrew copies thus far studied by me are: Paris, 929: niin; nlmnlt t ony, ' 'n-r l' nWK i: Y 0',1D' D'pD.

The Paris copy follows the Arabic original most literally, and, like all such literal versions, at times to the point of doing vio- lence to Hebrew grammar and construction. In contrast to this, Bodl. Ms. 1352.4 and Munich Ms. 297 are written in purer Heb- rew and employ a different terminology. They represent copies of the same version. The Vatican text terminates abruptly in the middle of the fifth chapter. The Jew. Theol. Seminary Ms. is badly worn away and perforated in spots. The Turin text, according to Peyron, has no title, but in his catalogue, Peyron records the colophon as the title of the text. The first chapter begins with the same words as the Bodleian and Munich texts.'8 Two supercommentaries to the Fusul are known to exist. One is found in the Vatican codex immediately following the Hebrew translation above mentioned; the other is a fragmentary com- mentary by the Karaite, Abrahamn Bali ben Jacob (ob. 1510), and is to be found in Lenin. Firkowitch 696.'9 The Vatican supercommentary is without name of author or date but it evi- dently follows the pattern of Averroes' long commentaries or for that matter, that of any Biblical commentary. First the basic text is quoted and then follows the exposition of the text, and the same is true of every passage commented upon. In this supercommentary, however, the author goes beyond a mere expounding of the text. He attempts to show the application of various logical theories to problems of theology. For him, 17 Steinschneider suggests that the name Lanis is possibly a corruption for Lagis, who is known to have written several commentaries. Cf. Oberset- zungen, p. 45. I8 n^;:D ~n= m~nl?mn mnlrn. See B. Peyron, Codices Hebraici di Regia Biblio- theca in Turino, No. 211. After this article had gone to press, I received word from the director of the Turin library that the Ms. in question no longer exists, having been destroyed by the fire that occurred there some three decades ago. '9 Steinschneider's opinion is that Abraham Bali used the Vatican text as the basis for his commentary. If Steinschneider is correct, we can readily account for the fragmentary nature of Bali's commentary; for, as it was prev- iously remarked, the Vatican version ends rather abruptly in the middle of the fifth chapter.

Obers. p. 45. 120 [6]</page><page sequence="7">[7] ~ALFARABI 'S FIVE CHAPTERS ON LOGIC12 as for Aristotle, logic is merely an instrument for the attainment of the "first principles" of philosophy.20 This instrument must be used for the purpose of solving theological and metaphysical problems. Thus, according to the supercommentator, when dealing with anthropomorphic expressions in Scripture, one must distinguish between the literal and figurative meanings of words ;2I and one must not fall into the error of ignorant people who take such expressions in their literal sense only. Or when we assert that God is prior to the world, the term, prior, must not be understood in its temporal sense, but rather in the sense of causality. God is prior to the world as cause is to effect.2 20 Vat. 49, fol. livy: &amp;z m'ri rrm n mai~' btnw im~-aH -i- ntinm -in ~.
