<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Part 2 Cognitive Perspectives The cognitive science of science investigates how human minds generate, process,  sustain, and transform scientific concepts. The basic idea is that the human mind  does not constitute a blank slate, but comes equipped with intuitive expectations  about relevant domains of the world around us. In science, these intuitions play a  twofold role. On the one hand, they pose cognitive obstacles that scientists need  to overcome using various tools. On the other, when addressed appropriately,  they function as scaffolds for a scientific understanding of the world. Thus, a  cognitive approach also sheds important new light on the rhetorical perspectives  developed in the first section of this volume. Science educators and communi- cators tend to explain highly counterintuitive scientific concepts and theories  by employing intuitively appealing and thus more easily digestible arguments,  images, and metaphors. By so transforming scientific concepts, they aim at  recruiting people’s intuitions to instill a scientific understanding of the world  around us. However, this strategy generates rather than avoids intuitive inter- pretations of scientific concepts and theories. Each of the contributions to this  section examines and discusses one or both of the roles intuition plays in the  development, communication, and understanding of science. As such, the vol- ume contributes to the burgeoning field that investigates the impact of human  cognition on science, science education, and the public understanding of science. </page> <page sequence="2">  </page> <page sequence="3"> Chapter 7 Suspicion toward Science and the Role  of Automatic Intuitions about Origins Elisa Järnefelt Abstract This chapter discusses how early developing automatic intuitions about pur- posefully made and functionally fixed natural phenomena can affect people’s  understanding and receptivity to scientific concepts, such as evolution and  anthropogenic climate change, that involve abandoning many of the automatic  hunches that people spontaneously possess about their environment. In addi- tion to discussing these automatic intuitions, this chapter also considers how  these intuitions may play a role in people’s trust of the scientists who form  and present the scientific information to the public, and how scientists could  tackle the challenge of communicating about science to the public in an accu- rate and welcoming way. Sometimes, being a scientist is a difficult thing. After publishing On the Origin  of Species in 1859, Charles Darwin was not ed only in academic circles. He served  also as a constant inspiration for the numerous cartoons and caricatures pre- sented in popular culture. These drawings often depict Darwin as an ape, or an  ape that is Darwin’s close relative just a few generations away. In other drawings,  evolution is depicted as a nonsensical dream or hallucination in which a worm  evolves into an ape that develops into a human that finally turns into Darwin, or  in which a fork transforms into a man, an oyster into a woman, and a wine bottle  into a priest who marries the man and the woman. (Browne; Bryant) As is often  109 </page> <page sequence="4"> 110 Part 2 • Chapter 7 the case with caricatures or parodies, besides being comical, these drawings have  a cruel intention (Browne). Transforming a person or an idea into a joke sends a  powerful message; it can diminish the authority or trustworthiness of the person  as a reliable informant and question whether her or his ideas should be taken  seriously. Darwin was neither the only nor the last naturalist whose credibility  and reliability has been questioned in such a manner. More recently, for example,  environmental scientists have experienced their fair share of doubt and distrust;  particular groups do not just doubt the existence of anthropogenic climate  change but feature it as pseudoscience, hoax, or conspiracy theory (Hmielowski  et al.; Leiserowitz; Lewandowsky et al.). The similarities between the theories  of evolution and anthropogenic climate change do not end here. In addition to  suspicion toward naturalists and scientists, everyday reasoning about both con- ceptions appears similar. Instead of understanding physical-causal mechanisms,  both natural processes are often construed in terms of purposes and intentions.  For example, adults commonly construe evolution as nature’s helpful response  to animals’ wants or needs (e.g., Gregory; Kelemen, “Teleological”). Similarly,  anthropogenic climate change is often understood in relation to a purposefully  behaving being, such as Nature, Earth, or God (Corner et al.; Donner, “Domain”  and “Making”; Mortreux and Barnett). In this chapter I seek to understand why the reception of the theories of  evolution and anthropogenic climate change share these similarities. Why  does everyday reasoning about the origin of natural phenomena take a certain  kind of shape? What makes an evolutionary or climate scientist suspicious and  untrustworthy? I start by assessing the previous notions that explain on a more general level  what kind of information is more likely to succeed or fail in cultural transmis- sion. After clarifying the essential role of automatic reasoning, I concentrate more  specifically on the intuitions that both children and adults have about the ori- gin of both living and nonliving natural phenomena. In reference to empirical  research, I identify developmentally stable patterns in people’s reasoning that  remain automatically active later in life: a tendency to assess nature as functioning  purposefully toward ends that benefit nature and remain fixed, and a tendency to  think that even though ordinary people cannot create nature, some other kinds  of beings can. Finally, I assess how these intuitions, together with the way people  assess novel arguments, are likely to play roles in ways people accept and reject  information about evolution and anthropogenic climate change and calibrate  their trust toward people who communicate these ideas. In the end, I make some  suggestions concerning more successful communication of scientific information. </page> <page sequence="5"> Suspicion toward Science and the Role of Automatic Intuitions about Origins 111 The Shape of Culturally Successful Information Why do people prefer and trust one kind of information over another? To bet- ter answer this question, it is necessary to acknowledge the difference between  automatic intuitions and reflection (Sperber, “Intuitive”). This division refers to  people’s ability to form information via (at least) two different cognitive processes:  system 1 and system 2. System 1 processes are instant, beyond one’s conscious  control, and produce representations about immediate reality. System 2 processes  require full attention, reflection, and effort and are more slow and sequential but  also allow one to assess, consciously endorse, or momentarily inhibit ideas that  are automatically formed via system 1 (J. Evans, “Dual-Processing”; Stanovich;  Kahneman; see also E. M. Evans in this volume). Even though people would like to think of themselves as being able to think  freely, they are rather predictable when relying on system 1 processes that are  formed without being taught to think in particular ways (Barrett and Kurzban;  Boyer and Barrett). For example, from very early on, people tend to think that  agents, apart from other physical objects, have goals and intentions (e.g., Spelke;  Wellman), that objects serve specific functions (e.g., Kelemen and Carey), and  that certain kinds of animals, for example, all bears, share something similar that  causes them to be fundamentally different from other kinds of animals or natu- ral entities, such as whales, beetles, or spruces (e.g., Atran; Gelman). Rather than  neatly following the lines of philosophical ontology (e.g., living thing, human- made artifact), system 1 automatic intuitions about the environment can be  understood in terms of cognitive adaptations that refer to types of situations that  have been stable in the human environment (e.g., detection of potential allies,  prey or predator, identification of the potential function of an object). Simply  put, humans, together with other animals, have fast acting intuitions — early  developing and persistent tendencies through which they process information  in particular ways — that can be understood to reflect recurring features of the  environment (Boyer and Barrett). One can wonder about the relevance of this — paying attention to  the con tours of automatically forming reasoning about the environment — for the  assessment of culturally transmitted information. After all, even though people  have intuitive and spontaneous reactions, they do not just blindly react to envi- ronmental stimuli but mostly rely on communicated information and are able to  reflect upon their own thoughts to interpret the world around them via system 2.  Partly, this is true. However, system 2 reflection does not occur in a vacuum  apart from system 1 automatic reasoning; rather, the two modes of reasoning are  </page> <page sequence="6"> 112 Part 2 • Chapter 7 interrelated. No matter the amount of practice and effort, inhibiting or erasing  automatic reasoning from one’s mind is impossible. Once the triggering stimulus  appears, system 1 automatic hunches fire off “ballistically” in the absence of con- scious control (Stanovich). Robert N. McCauley illustrates this with an example:  one cannot avoid perceiving the Earth as flat while standing on the ground, no  matter one’s ability to remind oneself that actually the Earth is a huge revolving  spherical object that is revolving around another round object (Naturalness). It is  not until the thought is cognized that individuals can consciously assess whether  they agree or disagree with their automatic understanding of the environment  (J. Evans, “Dual-Processing”; Kahneman; Stanovich). Given the sensitivity of system 1 automatic hunches, people often end up  unconsciously overrepresenting a wider range of environmental information in  terms of these intuitions (Sperber and Hirschfeld). For example, without the  need for explicit teaching, people are highly sensitive in detecting the faces of  other people. Besides effortlessly recognizing human faces, one cannot avoid see- ing faces in clouds, wall sockets, and burned toast (Guthrie). The sensitivity of  system 1 has effects on system 2 processing and cultural transmission of infor- mation as well. According to Dan Sperber (“The Modularity” and Explaining;  Sperber and Hirschfeld), from the cognitive point of view, the differences in the  ease of distribution of system 2 reflected ideas can be understood in terms of  the contours of system 1 automatic intuitions; the reflective ideas that people  easily recognize, adopt, and share are the ones that resemble initial reasoning  domains. Social psychological research resonates with this; people are prone  to show “confirmation bias,” “positivity bias,” or “my side bias” (e.g., J. Evans,  Bias; Mercier and Heintz; Nickerson), meaning that they are overconfident in  accepting information that is in line with their own reasoning and reject the  information that potentially contradicts or falsifies their beliefs (Kahneman). Sperber, together with Hugo Mercier (“Intuitive” and “Why”), discusses  this kind of pattern in people’s reflection in reference to “epistemic vigilance”  (Sperber et al., “Epistemic”). People are cautious toward information that is  transmitted by other people. Reliance on abstract cultural information and not  having to learn everything in the world firsthand is obviously a great advan- tage. However, when relying on abstract communicated information or other  people’s accounts of reality, one is at constant risk of hearing someone who is  misinformed, or even worse, is intentionally deceptive and lying. Given this,  Mercier and Sperber (“Intuitive” and “Why”; Mercier, “Reasoning” and “The  Social”; Sperber et al., “Epistemic”) point out that people constantly watch over  whether they can trust the information and the informant. What serves as an  </page> <page sequence="7"> Suspicion toward Science and the Role of Automatic Intuitions about Origins 113 instant anchor are the thoughts one already has — system 1 automatically formed  intuitions. Young children are already selective in their trust and doubt reliable  informants or majority opinion when it violates untaught intuitive assumptions  about the environment (Clément et al.; Seston and Kelemen). Similarly, adults  are less likely to accept information if it is not in line with instantly remem- bered background information, if formation of spontaneous inferences based  on the new information is difficult, and if the information is not accepted by  most of their peers (Mercier, “Reasoning” and “The Social”; Mercier and Sperber,  “Intuitive” and “Why”; Sperber et al., “Epistemic”). When detecting incoherence in communicated information, one has to  decide between two options: lower one’s trust in the speaker by doubting her  or his competence or benevolence, or lower trust in oneself and revise one’s own  beliefs (Mercier, “The Social”; Mercier and Sperber, “Intuitive”). Of these two  options, the first one is rather easy and quick whereas the latter — active reeval- uation of one’s own reasoning — is not likely to take place until one encounters  a social disagreement and must defend one’s own reasoning. For example, both  children and adults perform better in tasks that involve questioning their auto- matic impressions if they have to find the solution in a group of members who  initially disagree with one another. In contrast, a group of similarly minded peo- ple more commonly ends up supporting the already existing opinion (Mercier,  “Reasoning”; Schwind and Buder). To return to the particular question concerning the suspiciousness of the  theories of evolution and anthropogenic climate change: it is now clear that to  make the first step in understanding the cognitive roots of this phenomenon, one  has to understand more about people’s initial hunches on the origin of natural  phenomena. Initial Understanding about the Origin of Natural Phenomena I approach this task on two levels. First, I review developmental research in order  to see whether children’s reasoning about the origin of nature shows reliably  occurring and recurring tendencies. After this, I assess recent empirical research  that has been conducted among different groups of adults to see whether these  early developing reasoning tendencies remain active later in life (see Blancke et  al., “The Implications”; Bloom and Weisberg; Coley and Tanner, “Common”;  Kelemen, “Are Children” and “Teleological” for partly related accounts). In line with the previous section, when it comes to reasoning about the ori- gin of various objects and phenomena (e.g., artifacts, animals, plants, landforms,  </page> <page sequence="8"> 114 Part 2 • Chapter 7 meteorological phenomena) as well as these entities’ functional features, chil- dren’s reasoning does not align with the philosophically or scientifically correct  ontology (Boyer and Barrett). This does not mean that children are not excel- lent at, for example, separating artifacts and natural entities from one another  (Gelman and Kremer). Neither does it mean that children would be unable to  learn scientifically accurate physical-causal explanations about nature even at  young age (e.g., Ganea et al.; Kelemen et al., “Young”). Instead, it means that  children are prone to represent both artifacts and natural entities in a similar  fashion, and that their intuitions about objects easily overextend beyond philo- sophically correct ontological categories (artifacts vs. natural entities) (Kelemen,  “Are Children”; see also Wolpert, Six). Let me elaborate. From very early on, children tend to approach and rea- son about both artifacts and natural entities in terms of intended functionality.  These notions are not directly taught but formed in interactions with a typical  human environment. For example, children are able to assess objects’ functional  structure and usability as an indication of the designer’s intention (Kelemen  et al., “The Designing”; see also, e.g., Casler and Kelemen, “Young”; Cimpian  and Cadena; Phillips et al., “Learning” for examples of various implicit cues). In  parallel to this, children often conceptualize not only artifacts but also natural  entities as “made for” some specific functions that benefit the entity itself, other  natural entities, or nature generally rather than endorse explanations referring  to solely physical causes (e.g., DiYanni and Kelemen; Kelemen, “The Scope” and  “Why” and “British”). However, rather than understanding everything in their  environment as human-made (see Piaget), when reasoning about the origin of  natural entities, children prefer ideas about superhuman or nonhuman beings,  such as someone, God, or another natural entity (E. M. Evans, “Cognitive”;  Gelman and Kremer; Kelemen and DiYanni; see Gervais et al. and Järnefelt for  discussion). In addition to being effortlessly formed, these intuitions about the intended  purposes of both artifacts and natural entities are functionally fixed. This means  that once a certain kind of object or entity is conceptualized as made for some  purpose, children find it difficult to think that the object could serve any another  function (e.g., Casler and Kelemen, “Young”; German and Barret; Kelemen and  Carey; Vaesen). Here, the understanding of intentionality again plays a deter- mining role. Around the age of five, children have come to realize that knowing  the designer’s, rather than user’s, intention leads to knowing the true (fixed)  function of an object (e.g., Kelemen and Carey). For example, if the object was  originally designed to function as a clothes stretcher, it does not cease to be a  </page> <page sequence="9"> Suspicion toward Science and the Role of Automatic Intuitions about Origins 115 clothes stretcher even if someone later discovers it and uses it unknowingly for  exercising his back (Kelemen, “Intuitive”). Again, in parallel, once children map  a natural entity as a certain kind (i.e., as a member of certain generic species  [Atran], such as a member of bears, oaks, or bats), they understand the kind as  inherently immutable and fixed, and reject the idea of partial membership (e.g.,  Cimpian and Erickson; Gelman; Keil). Recent research has continued to assess whether these reasoning tenden- cies about fixed purposes and intentional design remain active on an automatic  level of cognitive processing also in adulthood. That is, in case these concep- tions have an automatic basis in the sense of unavoidable and constantly active  system 1 processing, one should find that when relying on instantly forming cog- nitive processing, adults also form these ideas unavoidably. However, in case these  reasoning tendencies are examples of automatized reflective reasoning that has  become effortless due to repeated practice, these views should be absent among  those adults who have practiced thinking otherwise (see McCauley, Naturalness,  for differences between automatic and automatized reasoning). So, what hap- pens when adults, who have contradicting reflective views, are put into situations  where they have to rely on automatic reasoning in order to provide an answer? A first line of research has assessed the automaticity of teleo-functional rea- soning (Kelemen and Rosset; Kelemen et al., “Professional”; see also Banerjee  and Bloom; Casler and Kelemen, “Developmental”; Heywood and Bering;  Lombrozo et al.). When answering under a restricted timeframe, even profes- sional scientists show an increased tendency to agree with teleo-functional  statements that describe living and nonliving nature to function toward self- or  nature-serving ends. This means that even years of scientific education and the  constant use of a physical-causal explanatory framework does not completely  remove the instant appeal of teleo-functional ideas, such as “rain falls in order to  allow plants to grow” or “the sun makes light so that plants can photosynthesize”  (Kelemen et al., “Professional”; see also Kelemen and Rosset). A second line of research has assessed whether the notion that some being  created nature is similarly automatically formed (Järnefelt; Järnefelt et al.). Here  the focus of attention has been on nonreligious individuals who explicitly dis- agree with the idea that any kind of higher power, God, or gods have created  nature. Studies in the United States and Finland show that, although religious  adults endorse creation more than nonreligious adults do, when assessing pictures  of living (e.g., giraffe, maple, pike) and nonliving (e.g., mountain, river, rainbow)  nature, without having time to reflect upon one’s own reasoning, nonreligious  adults show a tendency to increasingly understand nature as purposefully made  </page> <page sequence="10"> 116 Part 2 • Chapter 7 by some being. Responding to control items and to a separate control condition  further clarifies that adults do not agree with just any stimuli, or with just any  idea of a maker. In line with the distinction that children make, adults do not  similarly think that ordinary people can originate natural phenomena (Järnefelt;  Järnefelt et al.). To combine and summarize these empirical findings, certain recurrent  intuitions about the origin of natural phenomena can be recognized: (1) both  children and adults have a tendency to assess nature as functioning purposefully  toward ends that benefit nature and remain fixed, and (2) both children and  adults have a tendency to think that even though ordinary people cannot create  nature, some other kind of being can. Echoes of Automatic Intuitions in Reasoning about  Evolution and Anthropogenic Climate Change How do patterns in everyday reasoning and suspicious reactions toward theories  of evolution and anthropogenic climate change appear when assessing them in  the light of automatic intuitions about purpose, functional fixedness, and inten- tional design discussed in the previous section? Here I argue that the patterns in  people’s acceptance and rejection of both of these theories become more under- standable and predictable when assessed in reference to these intuitions. To  illustrate this, I offer four examples of scientific conclusions that can be inferred  based on the theories of evolution and anthropogenic climate change. After  each conclusion below, I point out, in reference to current research, how people  often reject or doubt these conclusions either partially or completely. I suggest  that these patterns of rejection can be understood in reference to the previously  discussed intuitions about intended functionality, as echoes of the contours of  instant intuitive understanding of the origin of natural phenomena. Conclusion 1: All natural entities are subject to change and extinction, despite  the apparent benefits of their present functions. Instead of accepting natural phenomena as ever changing, people are often  more comfortable with accepting biological change within a kind as long as it  does not lead to cessation of the function that the kind is understood to perform.  For example, people more readily accept the idea that one kind of bear can evolve  into another kind of bear than they do the idea of a common ancestry of bears  and finches (e.g., E. M. Evans, “Conceptual”). In this line of reasoning, intuitive  understanding of functionality and purpose is likely to play an informative role.  </page> <page sequence="11"> Suspicion toward Science and the Role of Automatic Intuitions about Origins 117 People often believe in function as the primary motor of adaptation (Kelemen,  “Teleological”). This means that without knowing how to describe the actual  mechanism of change, people often conclude that an entity’s current ability to  perform a beneficial function is the sole factor in why the entity or its trait exists  (Gregory; Kelemen, “Teleological”). Furthermore, offering a stark contradiction  to both conceptions of evolutionary change and the predicted consequences of  anthropogenic climate change, once a biological trait is recognized to carry a  beneficial function (e.g., coloration for camouflage, thick blood for coping with  parasites), it is more likely assumed to remain stable or fixed across time; not only  is the further prospect of evolutionary change seen as unlikely but also the pros- pect of extinction (Lombrozo and Rehder; see also Poling and Evans). Conclusion 2: Nature’s functioning also affects humans, not just nature itself. In line with the tendency to presume nature’s functioning as serving or  benefiting nature itself (e.g., Kelemen, “Why”; Kelemen and Rosset), a distinc- tion is often drawn between the sphere of nature and the sphere of humans. It  is common to underestimate both the effects of evolution and anthropogenic  climate change by excluding humans from being subject to either natural pro- cess. For example, people often assume that evolution applies only to nonhuman  entities or organisms that are distant from people’s habitat (e.g., E. M. Evans,  “Conceptual”; Shtulman and Schulz; see Atran for a folk-biological taxonomy).  Similarly, climate change is sometimes pictured as concerning only nonhuman  animals and distant habitats (Doyle), and people often doubt that they have per- sonally experienced global warming (Akerlof et al.). Conclusion 3: Changes in nature can be explained without reference to a non- human or superhuman being. Reasoning about evolution and anthropogenic climate change solely in  terms of nonagentive or unintentional physical-causal processes is relatively rare.  Instead, people — in both religious and secular cultural contexts — are prone to  mix ideas of supernatural beings together with conceptions of evolution and  anthropogenic climate change. For example, both evolution and climate change  are often seen as purposeful creations, or as phenomena that are ultimately  in control of a supernatural being (e.g., Corner et al.; Donner, “Domain” and  “Making”; Legare et al.; Mortreux and Barnett). In addition to ideas that are cul- turally understood and labeled as religious, based on research, people commonly  form ideas that share a similar cognitive structure about a being who is mysteri- ously (Sperber, “Intuitive”) able to originate natural phenomena, although they  </page> <page sequence="12"> 118 Part 2 • Chapter 7 use scientific or secular vocabulary. For example, in the context of the theory of  evolution, it is common to describe nature, natural entities, evolution, or natural  selection in terms of purposefully behaving beings who create the features or  entities that are purposeful in a particular situation (e.g., Blancke et al., “From  Ends”; Kelemen, “Teleological”; Moore et al.). When reasoning about anthro- pogenic climate change, people often assess nature or the Earth as a being that  will eventually take care for natural entities or itself, and “always wins somehow”  (Corner et al.; see also Connor and Higginbotham). Findings in studies about  adults’ automatic tendency towards teleo-functional reasoning and understand- ing of intentional design imply a potential relationship between these kinds of  ideas and intuitive reasoning tendencies: beliefs in nature’s agentive powers (e.g.,  belief in nature as a powerful being) independently predict an increased ten- dency to assess nature both as purposefully functioning (Kelemen and Rosset;  Kelemen et al., “Professional”) and purposefully made (Järnefelt; Järnefelt et al.).  Notably, this is the case also among those individuals who identify as atheists  and strongly disbelieve in any kind of higher power, God, or gods (Järnefelt et  al.). This suggests that even though religious and secular identities are tied to  different kinds of explicit belief systems, from the cognitive perspective, every- day understanding (in contrast to scientific understanding) about the origin of  nature may be rather similar, even though people identify and label their views  differently. Using scientific terminology does not yet guarantee that one rea- sons accurately in reference to the particular scientific theory (see also Guillo,  this volume). Conclusion 4: Changes in nature are causally linked to human actions. Finally, relating especially to reasoning about anthropogenic climate  change, while having a strong intuitive preference to think that nature is not  caused by human actions (e.g., Gelman and Kremer; Järnefelt; Järnefelt et al.),  the core idea behind anthropogenic climate change — that humans have a causal  effect on changes in sea levels, reflective properties of clouds, winds, wild fires,  or total animal populations (Karl and Trenberth) — is not likely to make instant  intuitive sense but instead sounds implausible (see also Donner, “Domain” and  “Making”; Rudiak-Gould). A Cautious Listener Makes a Suspicious Scientist In relation to the notions concerning cautiousness toward information that  contradicts automatic intuitions, presented in the beginning of this chapter, the  </page> <page sequence="13"> Suspicion toward Science and the Role of Automatic Intuitions about Origins 119 examples elucidate how the content of theories of evolution and anthropogenic  climate change contradicts preexisting and instantly activating intuitions of  nature’s apparent purpose and design. Without denying the existence of many  other — both cognitive and cultural — components, it is likely that intuitions  play a role in people’s suspicion toward both of these scientific theories. However, in addition to violating or contradicting the intuitive content of  information and eliciting cautiousness toward scientific ideas about the origin  of natural phenomena, researchers also encounter another kind of disadvantage  that is likely to even further elicit suspicion and distrust in listeners. As research  shows (e.g., Kelemen et al., “Professional”; Coley and Tanner, “Relations”), it  is good to remember that scientists are not in any way immune to these same  automatic cognitive tendencies and confirmation biases. However, given that  scientific reasoning takes place in an argumentative context, opportunities to  restrict their everyday reasoning are greater; researchers have more chances  to test their ideas in contexts in which they are more likely to experience dis- agreements (e.g., peer-reviewed journals, conferences) and reflect upon their  own arguments more than they would in an everyday interaction (Mercier and  Heintz; see also McCauley, “Scientific”). Given that this argumentative space  is not shared in mainstream culture where these ideas are communicated, for  members of the public it may seem that scientists fail to sound consistent and  coherent. Incoherence is again likely to prompt members of the public to revise  their trust in the speaker rather than in their own thoughts (see, e.g., Mercier and  Sperber, “Intuitive”). In line with this, research has found that, independently  of their worldviews, people calibrate their understanding about anthropogenic  climate change based on how same-minded or in agreement scientists appear  over the matter (Lewandowsky et al.; see also Connor and Higginbotham) (see  figure 7.1). People may be even more tempted to recalibrate their trust in evolutionary  and climate scientists in contexts where information about evolutionary pro- cesses and anthropogenic climate change is used in practice and combined with  technology. That is when science and scientists can appear as dangerous (Wolpert,  Is Science). For example, this takes place both in the context of biotechnology and  geoengineering. Interestingly, the resistance to both technological approaches  is similar (Corner et al.). In the context of hybridization and cloning, opposi- tion refers to these technologies as disgusting, unnatural, and immoral (e.g.,  Niemelä; see also Rozin). Even though the explanation behind negative reactions  is likely to involve various components (e.g., negative associations to pesticides or  occurrences in the history of science), acknowledgment of automatic intuitions  </page> <page sequence="14"> 120 Part 2 • Chapter 7 Individual's view of the  environment Decrease of trust in  Automatic intuitions about  the scientists and  the environment their theories In addition to this, Scientists offer information  the individual detects that contradicts with  incoherence; it seems like one’s own background  the scientist(s) cannot information decide what to think Figure 7.1 Recalibration of the listener’s trust in scientifi c information about the  origin of natural phenomena. about fi xed functionality and design may off er one additional layer of under- standing about people’s reactions. Namely, according to instant intuitions, it is  not humans who create biological kinds, or mix one kind of an organism with  another kind. Even though people seem to be open to artifi cial selection (e.g.,  breeding dogs) and hybridization within a kind (e.g., breeding mules that are the  off spring of two horse-kind animals, donkey and horse), gene technology involv- ing cloning and interspecies hybridization across diff erent kinds of animals (e.g.,  human vs. nonhuman animal) does not just violate the intuition of the nonhu- man identity of the maker, but also damages the notion of benefi cial and fi xed  functions that kinds are understood to perform (see also Niemelä). Similarly,  at the heart of the rejection of the use of technology to counteract the eff ects of  climate change is the idea of “messing with nature” — going against the natural  order (or fi xed functionality) that nature has purposefully set. In this mental  framework, defying the natural order is an immoral act that is understood to  further elicit nature’s revenge (Corner et al.). In sum, it is not necessarily a complete coincidence that scientists are some- times accused of “playing God” (Wolpert, Is Science); scientists can develop  </page> <page sequence="15"> Suspicion toward Science and the Role of Automatic Intuitions about Origins 121 ideas that in practice violate people’s automatic intuition of nature’s beneficial  functionality and also their intuition that a nonhuman being originated natural  phenomena. In line with Wolpert’s notion, here it is also good to emphasize that  science and technology are not the same thing; evolutionary or environmental  findings in science do not necessarily lead to technological applications, and evo- lutionary and climate scientists are not unavoidably involved with engineering.  However, this distinction may not be fully clear to the public (see also McCauley,  Naturalness and “Scientific”). Conclusion In this chapter I have traced echoes of two automatic intuitions in reactions to the  theories of evolution and anthropogenic climate change: (1) the understanding  of nature as purposefully fixed in its beneficial functions that serve nature itself,  and (2) the understanding of the origin of natural phenomena as purposefully  created by some nonhuman or superhuman being. I conclude that these intu- itions together with the cautiousness that people show toward novel arguments  are likely to play significant roles in suspiciousness toward both the theories of  evolution and anthropogenic climate change as well as toward the scientists who  produce and communicate these theories to the public. How can scientists better  communicate their findings and navigate through the potential prejudices that  people hold? Evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson (“Evolution”), who has initi- ated a university-wide evolutionary studies program at Binghamton University  called EvoS (“EvoS”), offers one kind of solution for better science commu- nication. EvoS does not require any prerequisites and is open for all students  across different faculties from sciences to humanities. As the very first step, the  teaching starts by acknowledging, addressing, and challenging the negative  associations and worries that people may have about evolutionary theory (e.g.,  immorality, determinism, eugenics). According to Wilson, when suspicions are  discussed openly, for example, by assessing the wider historical perspective of  utilizing theories as a tool for suppression, and by preliminarily discussing the  idea that morality and social equality can also be approached from the perspec- tive of modern evolutionary theory, students have the possibility to reflect on  these associations by themselves and put them on hold. Students can shift their  minds from an atmosphere of threat to an atmosphere of curiosity. After their  worries are addressed, students can actually learn about the basic concepts of  evolutionary theory (e.g., adaptation). After acquiring a broader understanding  </page> <page sequence="16"> 122 Part 2 • Chapter 7 of basic evolutionary concepts, a teacher discusses the more specific intricacies  of these concepts (e.g., not everything is adaptive). Throughout the course, stu- dents are treated as fellow scholars rather than passive receivers of information,  for example, by inviting them to actively form predictions based on the new  information they have learned, offering readings from primary research liter- ature rather than textbooks, and asking them to explore their own topic from  an evolutionary perspective. As a crucial component in this process, Wilson  underlines the importance of the university’s ability to act as a collaborative  unit. Understanding of evolutionary mechanisms offers an example of a com- mon language that defies the common field-specific specialization and seclusion  in research and allows interdisciplinary collaboration. This notion is further  supported by coordinating university-wide talks, which show in practice how  researchers, not just in the sciences, but also in social and behavioral sciences and  humanities, can work with different aspects of the same explanatory framework  and form a coherent unit. One indication of the effectiveness of Wilson’s approach is that, based on  the assessments conducted throughout the program, the factors that are com- monly discussed as problematic or hampering an understanding of the theory of  evolution (e.g., political or religious orientation), do not significantly affect the  students’ views or understanding about evolution in this program. What matters  more than their personal worldviews is that they are approached as fellow schol- ars who are instructed about the basic concepts honestly and accurately. In contrast to this, scientists and media often communicate about evolu- tion by using machine and design metaphors, or intentional and teleological  talk, for example, by referring to a personified nature or evolution that “designs”  traits “for” some function (Padian; Pigliucci and Boudry; see also Fox Keller).  Similarly, in the context of anthropogenic climate change, several scholars have  suggested that as a tool to raise ecological awareness, one should use agentive  reasoning in various ways, for example, to increase the sense of moral obligation  toward a being who is external to nature (e.g., Markowitz and Shariff) or to elicit  and strengthen the understanding of nature or the Earth as a being (e.g., Tam et  al.; White). Interestingly, in practice, the effects on people’s personal lifestyles  and behavior have remained basically nonexistent (Veldman et al.). For instance,  even if agentive views have effects on the ways people describe nature or their  actions toward nature, they do not necessarily have an effect on their willingness  to adopt conservational habits in practice (e.g., Kalland; Obadia). Similar to the form of visual representations of scientific concepts — dis- cussed more at length by Andrew Shtulman in this volume — metaphors anchor  </page> <page sequence="17"> Suspicion toward Science and the Role of Automatic Intuitions about Origins 123 to the prior understanding that people have of a phenomena and can actively  strengthen the misconceptions and interpretations that people form in reliance  on their everyday reasoning. Although scientists and educators can use agentive  language metaphorically (i.e., abandon agentive reasoning and explain evolu- tion or anthropogenic climate change in reference to a physical mechanism if  required), this does not mean that agentive metaphors or agentive reasoning  serve as any kind of conceptual aid to the public. Quite the contrary, it is proba- ble that, once being so in line with automatic intuitions about nature’s purposes  and design, these kinds of expressions just strengthen and further anchor ideas to  preexisting cognitive biases and impede learning about nature (see Ganea et al.;  see also Blancke, Tanghe, and Braeckman; and Tietge, this volume). To conclude, in the context of the understanding of both evolution and  anthropogenic climate change, it seems that instead of using agentive or  design metaphors, scientists should think of ways to use expressions that aid  physical-causal reasoning, for example, by referring to more familiar physical pro- cesses (Rudiak-Gould), given that understanding nonagentive or unintentional  mechanisms is something where everyone needs cognitive help. In addition to  enabling and paying more attention to accurate communication about the con- tent of scientific theories and allowing individuals to properly reflect upon their  automatic intuitions, in line with Wilson’s example (“Evolution”), scientists  could better focus on offering students, and also the public outside of universities,  an example of the university as a unit that is able to work in an interdisciplinary  manner, despite the scientific critique toward colleagues’ ideas. In addition to  being able to reflect the scientific conceptions by themselves, what seems to be  at least as essential to decreasing people’s suspiciousness and increasing openness  to learning this kind of information is an understanding of the special nature of  the culture of science associated with scientific theories, and welcoming people  to take actively part in it.
