<plain_text><page sequence="1">METAMORPHOSIS IN WALLACE STEVENS By SISTER M. BERNETTA QUINN, O.S.F. HAT is constant in Wallace Stevens's poetry, as well as in his theory of poetry, is emphasis on change, or?as he expresses the principle with greater nicety in the first of "Three Academic Pieces"?on metamorpho sis. He concerns himself first of all with the structure of reality; secondly, with the way in which man knows his world; and fi nally, with the transfigurations of that world as imagination acts upon it. Each succeeding year of his critical prose and his verse further defines metamorphosis as it functions in the areas of metaphysics, epistemology, and aesthetics, the latter term includ ing life itself considered as the highest of the arts. A primary aspect of metamorphosis in Stevens is the effect of the senses on extra-mental reality. No one sees quite the same rose as anyone else does; there is, in fact, a semantics of percep tion, wherein sense "is like a flow of meanings with no speech/ And of as many meanings as of men." What connotation is to a word the action of the senses is to a physical object. In "Som bre Figuration" Stevens remarks that reality is that about reality which impresses us: "As a church is a bell and people are an eye,/A cry, the pallor of a dress, a touch"; such a point of view relates him to impressionistic painting, a kinship made doubly clear by his habit of giving lyrics titles which might equally well apply to pictures ("Study of Two Pears," "Girl in a Night gown," "Landscape with Boat," "Woman Looking at a Vase of Flowers," "Man Carrying Thing," "Large Red Man Reading," to mention only a few). This variety of synecdoche is a con sequence of the selection made by the senses from the ineffably w</page><page sequence="2">SISTER M. BERNETTA QUINN, O.S.F. 231 multiple phenomena comprising the flux which overwhelms hu man consciousness from instant to instant. In "Bouquet of Roses in Sunlight," Stevens phrases the meta morphosis of perception thus: Our sense of these things changes and they change, Not as in metaphor, but in our sense Of them. So sense exceeds all metaphor. It exceeds the heavy changes of the light. The "difference that we make in what w*e see" is more trans forming than any rhetoric, so that as one of the three theories propounded in "Metaphors of a Magnifico" suggests, there are as many realities as observers. The word Stevens uses for the difference made by the subject in the object is description, which is "a little different from reality"; it is neither what is des cribed nor an imitation of it, but rather something artificial that exists in no place, only in the spirit's universe, that intangible "locale" of all seeming. This somewhat elusive view of appear ance is elaborated upon in the fifth section of "Description with out Place": about the restricted meaning he gives to description, Stevens here says: It is an expectation, a desire, A palm that rises up beyond the sea, A little different from reality: The difference that we make in what we see And our memorials of that difference, Sprinklings of bright particulars from the sky. The term Stevens makes synonymous with such description is revelation, the Biblical connotations of which he underlines in the sixth part of the poem; there, too, he speaks of description</page><page sequence="3">232 METAMORPHOSIS IN WALLACE STEVENS as the double, though not too closely the double, of our lives? artificial, visible, intense. The fullest illustration of "the difference that we make in what we see" is the early and widely anthologized lyric, "Sea Surface Full of Clouds," the various sections of which ring a single setting through five changes. The setting in question is a November seascape near Tehuantepec, at daybreak. Arranged in six tercets, each part of the poem delineates a view of the ocean that reflects the highly colored Mexican sky; Stevens works out his five-paneled picture with exquisite balancing of syntax, delicately adjusted shadings of diction, using for every twelfth line an explanatory sentence in French to indicate how the shifting selves of the observer re-model this "fluent mun do" of sea and cloudy heavens, how in turn they evolve protean cloud-blossoms in marine gardens. One of the poet's finest accounts of the process of perception is in "Woman Looking at a Vase of Flowers": It was as if thunder took form upon The piano, that time: the time when the crude And jealous grandeurs of sun and sky Scattered themselves in the garden, like The wind dissolving into birds, The clouds becoming braided girls. . . . Hoot, little owl within her, how High blue became particular In the leaf and bud and how the red, Flicked into pieces, points of air, Became?how the central, essential red Escaped its large abstraction, became, First, summer, then a lesser time, Then the sides of peaches, of dusky pears. . . . The crude and jealous formlessness Became the form and the fragrance of things Without clairvoyance, close to her.</page><page sequence="4">SISTER M. BERNETTA QUINN, O.S.F. 233 To the subject of the lyric, the bouquet becomes thunder, sum mer, the sides of peaches and pears; the abstract red and blue turn into particulars. Colors and shapes powerfully stir the woman; she is conscious of related impressions, which have a metamorphic nature: "The wind dissolving into birds,/The clouds becoming braided girls. . . ." These comparisons point out that the mind as well as the eye has its metamorphoses. The spectator walking about New Haven on an ordinary evening regards certain chapels and schools as transformed men, openly displaying in their new identities the secrets they hid while human: It is as if Men turning into things, as comedy, Stood, dressed in antic symbols, to display The truth about themselves, having lost, as things, That power to conceal they had as men. . . . In Ovid's Metamorphoses trees frequently are not really trees but victims of love; stones, rivers, stars, not actually inanimate settings of man's life but men and women removed to lower realms of existence. Stevens adapts the principle of mutation to accord with the exigencies of his twentieth-century world by making the buildings of a Connecticut city exteriorizations of its inhabitants, at least in the mind of one beholder. Besides the transformations effected by perception, things are changed by the words used to refer to them; nomenclature adds to the image on the retina, the vibrations on the ear drum. In "Certain Phenomena of Sound" Sister Eulalia is created of her name, just as is the dark-syllabled Semiramide: You were created of your name, the word Is that of which you were the personage. There is no life except in the word of it. I write Semiramide and in the script I am and have a being and play a part. You are that white Eulalia of the name.</page><page sequence="5">234 METAMORPHOSIS IN WALLACE STEVENS Earlier in this poem the Roamer, telling to the background of music what things he has seen as he wanders through the red woods, constructs what he speaks of: "A sound producing the things that are spoken." The same process, creation through music, occurs in "The Auroras of Autumn": As if the innocent mother sang in the dark Of the room and on an accordion,, half-heard, Created the time and place in which we breathed. . . . The subjunctive mode in this poem, and the use of the verb seem in "Certain Phenomena of Sound," prevent one from as cribing to Stevens such a thorough-going idealism as might otherwise be warranted by these passages. "A Post-card from the Volcano" declares that what is said about a mansion becomes a part of it. Stevens affirms the same belief in "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven": "The poem is the cry of its occasion,/ Part of the res itself and not about it." These are, perhaps, ex treme instances of reification, but they serve to show his con viction that the perceiving agent greatly alters reality. Some objects, on the other hand, resist the catalysts of lan guage and sense; among these are The weight of primary noon, The ABC of being, The ruddy temper, the hammer Of red and blue, the hard sound? Steel against intimation?the sharp flash, The vital, arrogant, fatal, dominant X. From the testimony of this poem ("The Motive for Metaphor") Stevens apparently considers summer as a fullness of expression too much itself to need or sustain metaphor, unlike the half seasons of autumn and spring, which some persons prefer to a complete reality. Certain roses in sunlight are</page><page sequence="6">SISTER M. BERNETTA QUINN, O.S.F. 235 Too much as they are to be changed by metaphor, Too actual, things that in being real Make any imaginings of them lesser things. Although ordinarily man can, at least in theory, make things over, some objects, like the two pears in a lyric from Parts of a World, impose their own qualities so violently that they "are not seen/As the observer wills," but as they are. Other ex amples wherein two forces pull in opposite directions, victory going to the real over the fictive, are the rising sun, calm sea, and moon hanging in the sky of "Notes toward a Supreme Fic tion," which Stevens declares "are not things transformed./Yet we are shaken by them as if they were." The perceiving agent is symbolized often by the wind, called Jumbo in the poem of that name, a "companion in nothingness" who although a trans former is himself transformed. In the poem significantly called "Metamorphosis" the wind plays around with the names of the months, which are as vitally connected with their referents as are the names of characters in a Jonsonian comedy: Yillow, yillow, yillow, Old worm, my pretty quirk, How the wind spells out Sep - tern - ber. . . . Summer is in bones. Cock-robin's at Caracas. Make o, make o, make o, Oto - otu - bre. And the rude leaves fall. The rain falls. The sky Falls and lies with the worms. The street lamps 4</page><page sequence="7">236 METAMORPHOSIS IN WALLACE STEVENS Are those that have been hanged, Dangling in an illogical To and to and fro Fro Niz - nil - imbo. From the very start the wind is shown taking liberties with its autumn world, altering yellow to yillow as illustration of how September leaves lose their clear yellow to the brown stains of decay. Of summer, only the skeleton is left; the robin, symbol of summer, has migrated to Venezuela. At the end of stanza two, the sound of September is distorted by the wind to Oto - o tu - bre-, after evidences of seasonal change the word finally becomes Niz - nil - imbo, a blending of frozen, nil, and limbo, with of course a suggestion also of November. It is no shock to hear that leaves and rain fall, since this is their natural behavior, though the adjective rude as a modifier for leaves causes some surprise. But when the sky falls, to lie with the worms, one realizes that a meaningful universe where things happen ac cording to expected patterns has been replaced by a surrealistic one, void of reason, as different as possible from things of Au gust, a world where street lamps are crazily pushed to and fro by the wind, as if they were Villon's hanged men. The relation of subject to object is a metaphysical problem Stevens likes to meditate upon, as shown by the sixty-page lyric, "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven." In the second section, he supposes that "these houses are composed of ourselves," with the result that New Haven becomes "an impalpable town," its bells, "transparencies of sound"; if this be true, then it follows that New Haven is "So much ourselves, we cannot tell apart/ The idea and the bearer-being of the idea." Further on he ad vises us to consider "Reality as a thing seen by the mind,/Not that which is but that which is apprehended." If these supposi tions are valid, man might be regarded as a magician who makes phenomena real. The flowering Judas, dark-spiced branches of</page><page sequence="8">SISTER M. BERNETTA QUINN, O.S.F. 237 trees, cat-bird's gobble are "real only if I make them so." ("Holiday in Reality") A final step in this tracing of the metamorphoses undergone by the objective world is the way in which a whole age takes character from one powerful figure. The term Elizabethan as applicable to the golden period of the Sixteenth Century is too dulled by use for flaming details of its origin to leap in the minds of average men, but Stevens, with characteristic alertness, looks afresh at the hackneyed phrase Elizabethan age and sees Elizabeth as a green queen in a summer of sun, the greenness and sunlight created by her own splendor: Her green mind made the world around her green. The queen is an example. . . . This green queen In the seeming of the summer of her sun By her own seeming made the summer change. There are various kinds of queens?red, blue, green, argent? each of whom bestows an identity upon her milieu. Just as metamorphosis links the objective and the subjective worlds, so it connects the realm of reality with the realm of the imagination. In fact these are not two realms at all, but one? the realm of resemblance. Everything in our environment is, in certain respects, like everything else, bound together in an inescapable relationship which is the basis of appearance. In "Three Academic Pieces" Stevens shows how this truth operates by analyzing the colors of a seascape: Take, for example, a beach extending as far as the eye can reach bordered, on the one hand, by trees and, on the other, by the sea. The sky is cloudless and the sun is red. In what sense do the objects in this scene resemble each other? There is enough green in the sea to relate it to the palms. There is enough of the sky reflected in the water to create a resemblance, in some sense, between them. The sand is</page><page sequence="9">238 METAMORPHOSIS IN WALLACE STEVENS yellow between the green and the blue. In short, the light alone creates a unity not only in the recedings of distance, where differences become invisible, but also in the contacts of closer sight. So, too, sufficiently generalized, each man resembles all other men, each woman resembles all other women, this year resembles last year. The beginning of time will, no doubt, resemble the end of time. One world is said to resemble another. It is easy to see how like things resemble each other (man and man, woman and woman, year and year); it is not so easy to apply this principle to dissimilar objects, such as sand and water, palm tree and sky. But Stevens's ingenuity in using color as a bond is persuasive enough to let the illustration stand as a foun dation for his aesthetic theory. Resemblance is omnipresent in Nature; poetry, however, must supply resemblances to its fictions if these are to be truly su preme. Fortunately, it has two ways of doing so denied to Nature, as the essay goes on to explain: In metaphor (and this word is used as a symbol for the single aspect of poetry with which we are now concerned, that is to say: the creation of resemblance by the imagina tion, even though metamorphosis might be a better word) ?in metaphor, the resemblance may be, first, between two or more parts of reality; second, between something real and something imagined . . . and, third, between two imagined things. For the second way, Stevens gives as an example music and that which music evokes in us; for the last he has in mind two ab stractions. The importance of equations in the critical prose of Wallace Stevens can hardly be over-stated, a sign of intellectual exacti tude found also in the criticism of Ezra Pound; indeed, Pound's Imagist tenets are the equivalent of Stevens's passion for finding metaphors that come ever closer and closer to the ideal resem</page><page sequence="10">SISTER M. BERNETTA QUINN, O.S.F. 239 blance. The first of the "Three Academic Pieces" is rich in equa tions: accuracy of literature is equated with accuracy of the structure of reality; reality, with the central reference for poet ry; the desire for resemblance, with the desire to enjoy reality; and both these with the desire for elegance; false exaggeration, with the disturbance of balance between imagination and reality; life in metaphor, with the imagination. Stevens here discusses six topics: (a) poetry (b) metaphor (c) metamorphosis (d) re semblance (e) partial similarity between two dissimilar things (f ) activity of the imagination. If these are considered anony mously, as letters, an analysis of the essay reveals that a?b~c? d?e?f. He clarifies his terms carefully, excluding identity and imitation from the meaning of resemblance, and hence from the meaning of the five topics synonymous with it, for instance, from metamorphosis. This is not the only instance in his criticism where Stevens uses metamorphosis and poetry interchangeably. In "Effects of Analagy," delivered at Yale as a Bergen lecture in 1948, he says: Poetry is almost incredibly one of the effects of analogy. This statement involves much more than the analogy of figures of speech since otherwise poetry would be little more than a trick. But it is almost incredibly the outcome of figures of speech or, what is the same thing, the outcome of the operation of one imagination on another, through the instrumentality of the figures. To identify poetry and meta phor or metamorphosis is merely to abbreviate the last re mark. The same article elucidates an equation even more stimulating than those in "The Realm of Resemblance": the poet's sense of the world^the poet's world^the poet's subject=reality plus imagination. Such meditations in philosophy, carried on with an extraordinary seriousness, make the term hedonist, accorded to</page><page sequence="11">240 METAMORPHOSIS IN WALLACE STEVENS Stevens by more than one critic, hardly an appropriate one; they invalidate likewise the view that he is merely a strummer of nuances on a guitar, an exponent of preciosity, a dandy. Four years before the Bergen lecture on analogy, another Stevens essay, "The Figure of the Youth as Virile Poet," laid the critical foundations for a metamorphic concept of poetry. After reviewing the difficulties of defining poetry, Stevens here remarks that at times we feel confident of reaching a center around which variations of the definition may cluster: "We say that poetry is metamorphosis and we come to see in a few lines descriptive of an eye, a hand, a stick, the essence of the mat ter." The "matter" which Stevens is referring to here is the vis or noeud vital which might constitute the center of poetry, dis covery of which is a prerequisite for any valid definition. The philosopher, relying only upon reason, can never come to such a definition. Can the poet? Enigmatically, Stevens puts his an swer to this question in a suppositional manner, confusing us by his introduction of the indicative form was into the conditional clause: Suppose the poet discovered and had the power thereafter at will and by intelligence to reconstruct us by his trans formations. He would also have the power to destroy us. If there was, or if we believed there was, a centre, it would be absurd to fear or to avoid its discovery. This dangerous nature of poetry finds further articulation in "Poetry Is a Destructive Force": That's what misery is, Nothing to have at heart. It is to have or nothing. It is a thing to have, A lion, an ox in his breast, To feel it breathing there.</page><page sequence="12">SISTER M. BERNETTA QUINN, O.S.F. 241 Coraz?n, stout dog, Young ox, bow-legged bear, He tastes its blood, not spit. He is like a man In the body of a violent beast. Its muscles are his own. . . . The lion sleeps in the sun. Its nose is on its paws. It can kill a man. One might imagine these lines as describing one of Ovid's trans formations, since in these, when human beings were made beasts, reason was always transferred into the body of the irrational creature. The last six lines might almost apply to Hippomenes in Book Ten of the Metamorphoses, when after his successful wooing of Atalanta he meets doom at the hands of Venus, whose temple he has defiled; he is turned into a lion, together with his bride, and condemned to roam the Caledonian forest. Stevens is not content to state that poetry is metamorphosis; he must also write a poem wherein it shows itself to be so. There are different degrees of excellence in poetry considered as metamorphosis, depending upon the things compared. To return to "The Realm of Resemblance," if these are two unlike things of adequate dignity, the resemblance transfigures, sub limates them. The common property is made brilliant. When the human mind moves from some exquisite earthly scene, such as a moonlit evening on a Caribbean island, to the thought of Paradise, both ideas gain in glory. In such a manner poetry transfigures, though not always so ambitiously. About this, Stev ens says: The images in Ecclesiaste: 'Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern'</page><page sequence="13">242 METAMORPHOSIS IN WALLACE STEVENS ?these images are not the language of reality, they are the symbolic language of metamorphosis, or resemblance, of poetry, but they relate to reality and they intensify our sense of it and they give us the pleasure of clentor and solemnity' in respect to the most commonplace objects. The silver cord, golden bowl, pitcher, and wheel are parts of the tangible world though used in this passage as symbols to effect metamorphosis or resemblance or poetry?here Stevens makes no attempt to differentiate among the three. The des truction of the body, which these represent figuratively, borrows an imaginative glory from them, just as they, inanimate crea tures, acquire a new luster from their association with human death. Poetry satisfies our desire for resemblance but more than that, by the activity of the imagination in discovering likeness, it intensifies reality, enhances it, heightens it. One more point, in a discussion of how poetry is metamorpho sis in the writing of Wallace Stevens, is that art, by erasing the defects of its original, results in the ideal, in the universal un limited by the particular, though drawn from it. In his most complete poetic statement on aesthetics, "Notes toward a Su preme Fiction," which concludes Transport to Summer, Stevens presents the poem as transmuting life to Eden-like perfection: "The poem refreshes life so that we share,/For a moment, the first idea. . . ." Later in the same work he rephrases the pro position thus: "The freshness of transformation is/The fresh ness of a world." Stevens works in the opposite direction from the Platonic theory. For Plato a poetic figure about a plum (A) was a copy of a real plum (B) which might perhaps have a bad spot on its underside and which itself was copied from the perfect plum (C) existing in the world of ideas. For Stevens, C drops out and A is superior to B. He is, indeed, closer to Aristotelian imitation, in spite of his repugnance for the term imitation as expressed in "The Realm of Resemblance." To Aristotle mimesis was not a mere copying of the object as it</page><page sequence="14">SISTER M. BERNETTA QUINN, O.S.F. 243 existed in nature; it was a resemblance worked out into perfec tion in so far as the maker was able to do so. All aspects of the object extraneous to its perfection were eliminated. The su preme fiction must give pleasure, it must change, but it must also be abstract?the Stevensian word for ideal. One characteristic of the world of Wallace Stevens is the fluidity of essence. Besides the union of opposites in Nature, there is also a mysterious transference of essences. Now that the concept of essence is no longer taken for granted?at least in several schools of modern philosophy?this interference with quiddity requires less suspension of disbelief than it would have in earlier periods. One instance of such mutation occurs in the middle section of "Notes toward a Supreme Fiction": the water of the lake, says the poet, was "Like a momentary color, in which swans/Were seraphs, were saints, were changing es sences." In "Variations on a Summer Day," the rocks of the cliffs are heads of dogs that turn into fishes and plunge into the sea; this, of course, happens only in the imagination though the desideratum is "To change nature, not merely to change ideas." "The Apostrophe to Vincentine" begins with the poet's imag ining Vincentine as a small, nude, nameless creature between single-colored earth and dark blue sky; then he actually sees her, and she changes to a warm, clean girl in a whited green dress (green standing as it usually does in Stevens for reality) ; when she approaches, talking, he adds her emotions to his con ception of her, since what others feel makes a difference in what we see: And what I knew you felt Came then. Monotonous earth I saw become Illimitable spheres of you, And that white animal, so lean, Turned Vincentine Turned heavenly Vincentine And that white animal, so lean, Turned heavenly, heavenly Vincentine.</page><page sequence="15">244 METAMORPHOSIS IN WALLACE STEVENS The monotonous earth metamorphoses into illimitable spheres of Vincentine, and she herself has turned from the lean white animal with which the poem started to just the opposite of animality?to heavenly Vincentine, the adjective here heightened by repetition and by the ambiguity of its first use. Stevens has meticulously chosen his heroine's name, for reasons of sense as well as of sound, since Vincentine means conquering-, the word not only serves as a rhyme for between, lean, clean, and green, but signifies the victory of consciousness over inanimate being. Still one more illustration of the fluidity of essence is the poem "The House Was Quiet and the World Was Calm," in which "The reader became the book; and summer night/Was like the conscious being of the book," a progression which iden tifies the reader with the summer night. Again Stevens sur prises by using the indicative where accepted grammar would demand the subjunctive, as if to obliterate the distinction be tween wish and fulfillment; the scholar hears the words of the book spoken "as if there was no book." The poet goes on to say that truth itself is summer, the night, the reader?a blend ing of essences reminiscent of Eliot's "music heard so deeply that you are the music" in the Quartets. The entire lyric is but another phrasing of the exchanges between man and his en vironment, a topic which Stevens has been experimenting with since the 1917 publication of his play, "Carlos among the Candles." This brief drama opens with the entrance of Carlos, carrying a lighted taper. His first speech includes in embryo all that Stevens has later enunciated on the instability of es sence : How the solitude of this candle penetrates me! I light a candle in the darkness. It fills the darkness with solitude, which becomes my own. I become a part of the solitude of the candle ... of the darkness flowing over the house and into it. . . . Just to go through a door, and the change . . . the becoming a part, instantly, of that profounder</page><page sequence="16">SISTER M. BERNETTA QUINN, O.S.F. 245 room . . . equally to feel it communicating, with the same persistency, its own mood, its own influence . . . and there, too, to feel the lesser influences of the shapes of things, of exhalations, sounds. . . . Whatever the shortcomings of this piece as theater, its epistemo logical foreshadowings are noteworthy. To disbelieve in the separateness of things is to court pan theism. Wordsworth, to whom Stevens has been compared, is popularly (whether justifiably so or not) associated with this type of thinking. Amidst the irritations, tedium, and discour agements of life, the desire to become some unsusceptible ob ject is not an uncommon one, the desire to be, for example, a sun-drenched rock on a sweep of Hawaiian beach, a thinking stone soothed by sea-wind and palm-shadows, detached from all burdens of humanity. Such tales as Niobe's are perhaps due to the longing to escape from grief; escapism, incidentally, is a term to which Stevens has never objected. No one can better suggest this imaginary metempsychosis. After commenting on how closely Stevens approaches romantic pantheism, John Mal colm Brinnin, in his contribution to the Stevens issue of Voices (Spring, 1945), goes on to say: "If it is possible to understand how it feels to be a pear, a green light on the sea, a bowl of flowers, Stevens manages, with necromantic conviction, to say that he does." Once man understands the nature of his world and of poetry he will, particularly if he is an artist, re-fashion reality in such a way as to achieve happiness in what will then become a ter restrial paradise. Adam was capable of something close to this: His mind made morning, As he slept. He woke in a metaphor: this was A metamorphosis of paradise, Malformed, the world was paradise malformed.</page><page sequence="17">246 METAMORPHOSIS IN WALLACE STEVENS According to this view, imaginative activity is a way of render ing man divine, in the sense that he shares God's creative power: the "Pastoral Nun" in the last year of her age feels she has discovered this to be true and that if she lives in harmony with her faith in the oneness of poetry and apotheosis: Everything becomes morning, summer, the hero, The enraptured woman, the sequestered night, The man that suffered, lying there at ease, Without his envious pain in body, in mind, The favorable transformations of the wind As of a general being or human universe. In "The Figure of the Youth as Virile Poet," Stevens also makes poetry synonymous with apotheosis. He characterizes the creative process thus: The way a poet feels when he is writing, or after he has written a poem that completely accomplishes his purpose is evidence of the personal nature of his activity. To des cribe it by exaggerating it, he shares the transformation, not to say, apotheosis, accomplished by the poem. The relevance of this to the Stevensian doctrine of resemblance, or metamorphosis, is obvious. In "A Pastoral Nun" Stevens underlines the connection of poetry, apotheosis, and resemblance by pointing out that the first two resemble each other in that "Each matters only in that which it conceives." Re-molding reality is not confined to men; even a rabbit can create through imagination a more satisfactory world than that of actuality, or so Stevens would convince us in one of his em pathetic excursions into other than human consciousness, "A Rab bit as King of the Ghosts." Here the rabbit reduces the cat from a monument to a bug in the grass, little and green, where as he himself grows to "a self that fills the four corners of the</page><page sequence="18">SISTER M. BERNETTA QUINN, O.S.F. 247 night." Everything in his environment now exists only for him ?the trees, the vastness of night; he becomes more and more important in the cosmos until his head rises beyond the atmos phere of earth into space itself. The poem as a whole is a sa tiric expression of anthropomorphism. This creative power, this sorcerer's gift capable of producing a terrestrial paradise, does not function automatically; it is an act of will, since imagination is the will of things. Nowhere is the conscious striving to effect a mutation of milieu more con cretely brought out than in "Human Arrangement": on a rainy evening the speaker projects an imagined wooden chair into the sky, so that it becomes . . . the clear-point of an edifice, Forced up from nothing, evening's chair, Blue-strutted curule, true?unreal, The center of transformations that Transform for transformation's self, In a glitter that is a life, a gold That is a being, a will, a fate. This imaginary chair in the real rainy sky reminds one of Mari anne Moore's imaginary gardens with real toads in them and serves much the same purpose in emphasizing the interp?n?tra tion of the actual and the fictive in any true work of art. At the present time, realization of the resources of the imag ination is intermittent, confined to "moments of awakening,/Ex treme, fortuitous, personal," which correspond to Eliot's intu itional flashes in the Quartets. But the day will come when earth will constitute all the heaven that a savage race hungers for, a primal paradise regained through courage. It does not seem to bother Mr. Stevens that he probably will not be around</page><page sequence="19">248 METAMORPHOSIS IN WALLACE STEVENS to enjoy it; for him, there is always the solace of the blue gui tar. Yet he is not entirely without misgivings in thus fashioning his Weltanschauung: A little while of Terra Paradise I dreamed, of autumn rivers, silvas green, Of sanctimonious mountains high in snow, But in that dream a heavy difference Kept waking, and a mournful sense sought out, In vain, life's season or death's element. ("Montrachet-le-Jardin") In the disorders which war causes, consciousness and fact re place imagination and fiction. War's tremendous impacts, just like the forces of Crispin's sea, cannot be managed: We are confronting, therefore, a set of events, not only be yond our power to tranquillize them in the mind, beyond our power to reduce them and metamorphose them, but events that stir the emotions to violence, that engage us in what is direct and immediate and real, and events that in volve the concepts and sanctions that are the order of our lives and may involve our very lives; and these events are occurring persistently, with increasing omen, in what may be called our presence. But metamorphosis, at least in times of peace, rebuilds our uni verse. Man is indeed the captain of his soul, the master of his fate, though he seldom acts as if he were; if he did, he would achieve freedom, as Stevens declares in "The Latest Freed Man." The freed man is tired of metaphysics, of trying to explore essences. His desired emancipation is presented thus: For a moment on rising, at the edge of the bed, to be,</page><page sequence="20">SISTER M. BERNETTA QUINN, O.S.F. 249 To have the ant of the self changed to an ox With its organic boomings, to be changed From a doctor into an ox, before standing up, To know that the change and that the ox-like struggle Come from the strength that is the strength of the sun. . . . It was how he was free. "On the Road Home," the next poem in Parts of a World, ac centuates Stevens's relativism by saying that freedom comes only after man discovers there is no absolute truth. After the denials of the speaker and his companion, the grapes grow fatter, the tree changes from green to blue ("Then the tree, at night, be gan to change/Smoking through green and smoking blue"), the night becomes warmer, closer. Everything takes on a new pleni tude of being, as the six superlative adjectives in the last four lines indicate: largest, longest, roundest, warmest, closest, strong est. Set against the imagination as shaping spirit is the desire of Stevens, expressed with equal vividness, to face things as they are. Indeed, his devotion to things as they are is hard to recon cile with his wish to remould them to what they should be. It may be that these two contradictory views are merely another instance of his Heracleitan opposites which fuse into a third and perfect singular?but on the other hand their incompatibility may constitute a crucial lack of clarity in his aesthetic, though perhaps the clash might better be described as a sign of countries of the mind yet to be explored. Subtle as Stevens's propositions are and admirable as is the intricacy with which he has devised them in over a quarter of a century, there appear to be basic difficulties in his position, which suggest that the center which he seeks is still in the future tense. On the side of things as they are, Stevens advocates a com plete acceptance of the present, not an evasion such as that prac</page><page sequence="21">250 METAMORPHOSIS IN WALLACE STEVENS ticed by the "metamorphorid" Lady Lowzen of "Oak Leaves Are Hands": In Hydaspia, by Howzen Lived a lady, Lady Lowzen, For whom what is was other things. Flora she was once. She was florid A bachelor of feen masquerie, Evasive and metamorphorid. MacMort she had been, ago, Twelve-legged in her ancestral hells, Weaving and weaving many arms. . . . So she in Hydaspia created Out of the movement of few words Flora Lowzen invigorated Archaic and future happenings, In glittering seven-colored changes, By Howzen, the chromatic Lowzen. Under this witty treatment is serious criticism: nothing but the past and the future exists for Lady Lowzen, who is adept at making these come alive and take on shimmering iridescence but who has no distinctive character of her own, as well as no belief in the reality of her Indian (Hydapsia, Howzen) environment. Stevens shows her metamorphorid nature by distorting Flora to florid, by using the word bachelor to keep even her sex from definiteness, by parodying ancestral halls to hells. As Miss Mac Mort, Flora had waited, spider-like, preoccupied with the splen did past of her family as symbolized in heraldic designs. A subtle overtone here is the etymology of Flora's maiden name: MacMort, the son (daughter) of death. Now, unsatisfied with being Lady Lowzen, she still dreams of the romantic past and the exciting future, her imagination a prism through which these</page><page sequence="22">SISTER M. BERNETTA QUINN, O.S.F. 251 two tenses pass. In the present she has no interest; her meta morphic powers do not touch it. The problems raised by conflicting aspects of Stevens's theory of the imagination are not minor ones, though since their solu tion is "work in progress" one cannot at the present time criti cize the theory with any conclusiveness. It would appear to be indisputable, however, that Stevens is a meliorist in the sense that he considers the human race to be moving forward toward a time when the faculties which comprise the psyche will be understood fully and will be used to the maximum of their powers. Then statements about the "change immenser than/A poet's metaphors in which being would/Come true" can be made in the indicative rather than in the subjunctive. Is such a Utopian position tenable? The philosopher by pro fession would probably answer that one cannot (and never will be able to) think by imagining, since nothing is more unsuc cessful in philosophy than an attempt to obliterate the distinc tions between the abstract and the concrete. Poetry, he would say, deals with the concrete, the particular; philosophy, with the abstract, the universal?to which Stevens might reply by quot ing from his description of the primitive man, held up as para gon, who "Imagines, and it is true, as if he thought/By imag ining, anti-logician, quick/With a logic of transforming certi tudes." ("Sombre Figuration") And perhaps the philosopher in refutation might then point to the description of heaven in "Sunday Morning"?an oriental paradise characterized by sus pended motion except for the plucking of lutes?as an example of what happens when one demands that the supra-sensible be clothed in sensory images. Despite Plato, Lucretius, Santa yana, the marriage of poetry and philosophy is ordinarily not a happy one. However, there is every reason to believe that one of Stevens's delicately testing intelligence will never rest content with his discoveries, whether in aesthetics or metaphysics; his mind is 5</page><page sequence="23">252 METAMORPHOSIS IN WALLACE STEVENS too fine to turn to stone by regarding all questions as answered. Undoubtedly the present stage of inquiry is "a moving contour, a change not quite completed." The spirit of Wallace Stevens is the spirit described in the tenth section of "An Ordinary Even ing in New Haven": "It resides/In a permanence composed of impermanence." This is as it should be in one whose thought has metamorphosis at its heart. A mosaic of a man, even a major artist, is like a mosaic of the weather; in the very fluidity of both there is permanence of a sort: See how On a day still full of summer, when the leaves Appear to sleep within a sleeping air, They suddenly fall and the leafless sound of the wind Is no longer a sound of summer. So great a change Is constant. ("The Statue at the World's End") Yet, like the weather, a man can only be described from day to day.</page></plain_text>
