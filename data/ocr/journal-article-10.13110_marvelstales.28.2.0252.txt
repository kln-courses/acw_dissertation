HofMann The Fairy as Hero(ine) and Author Representations of Female Power in Murat’s  “Le Turbot” The fairy tale “Le Turbot” (1699) by Henriette-Julie de Castelnau, Comtesse  de Murat, is remarkable for its foregrounding of the fairy Turbodine: not only  is Turbodine both the tale’s true hero and heroine, but she is also the tale’s  author, a character both developing plot—her own and others’—and nar- rating it. Far from being an auxiliary character, Turbodine is the protagonist of  the tale whose story is ultimately her story, not that of the traditional heroic  couple of prince and princess. Her exceptionality is conveyed not only  through her hyper fairy function—she ultimately shapes the destinies of three  kings (Coquerico, Lucidan, and Grimaut), two queens (the unnamed Queen  of Caprare and Grimasse), three princes (Fortuné, Princillon, and Brillantin),  and four princesses (Bluette, Risette, Princillette, and Fleurbelle)—but also  through her status as an independent sovereign queen with more influence  and wealth than her husband, le roi de Coquerico, and more initiative and  prowess than King Lucidan. Turbodine is a woman who possesses power typically associated with mas- culinity, such as ruling and bestowing kingdoms, waging war, and arranging  marriages. While highlighting this power, which is integral to her authorship of  the plot, the narration also disguises it by placing limits and conditions on  Turbodine’s fairy art and attributing them to the superior dictates of fate.  Further, the narration excuses and glosses over the specifics of Turbodine’s  masculine actions; thus is Murat able to present Turbodine as a forceful but  feminine character without the need for cross-dressing or metamorphosis.  Turbodine’s virile heroism is tempered by the fact that she ultimately uses her  Marvels &amp; Tales: Journal of Fairy-Tale Studies, Vol. 28, No. 2 (2014), pp. 252–277.

However, power and knowledge in the tale are repeatedly figured as feminine,  and the precious concerns of the conteuses1 (e.g., infidelity, marriage of inclina- tion, and female independence) are given a strong voice through Turbodine,  who is also a vehicle for Murat’s “defense of women” and the contestation and  undermining of patriarchal authority, evident throughout her oeuvre.2 Whereas Murat figures the woman author as fairy in her preface, “To  Modern Fairies,”3 which opens Histoires sublimes et allégoriques, “Le Turbot,”  which closes this collection of tales, figures the fairy as author. The figure of  Murat-as-Turbodine is self-empowering, whereas that of Turbodine-as-Murat  acknowledges the limitations of the power of women in the literary field, in  what would later come to be known as the republic of letters.4 The ostensible  limits to Turbodine’s power and her simultaneous influence over all the events  in the tale mirror the status of Murat and her fellow conteuses as salonnières and  women writers: although writing in a minor and ridiculed genre and mocked  as femmes savantes or précieuses by opponents in the Querelle de femmes and the  Querelle des Anciens et des Modernes, French women writers of the 1690s were  supporters of the arts, arbiters of taste, and creators of new literary genres,  including the portrait, the nouvelle, and, of course, the literary fairy tale or  conte de fées. Turbodine’s stated limitations are representative of Murat’s realiza- tion of her own limited efficacy in contributing to the discourse on and defense  of women: throughout her oeuvre she “insists on subjecting her heroines to  the laws of society” in acknowledgment of the societal forces that render them  powerless (Clermidy-Patard 191). Yet Turbodine’s triumph and the passing of  fairy power and authorship to her heir, Princillette, at the end of the tale signal  two other characteristics of Murat’s oeuvre identified by Geneviève Clermidy- Patard, doubling and amplification, which offset the ambiguity of women’s  power in the tale; they also suggest the intertextuality of the conteuses’ tales.  “Le Turbot,” with Turbodine as fairy author, seems to be the narrative counter- point or the textual embodiment of the spirit of Murat’s “To Modern Fairies.” Turbodine in Context Looking at “Le Turbot” in relation to its source tale, Straparola’s “Pietro the  Fool” (1550), and to Marie-Catherine d’Aulnoy’s own version of Straparola’s  tale, “Le Dauphin” (1698), reveals how innovative Murat is in creating  Turbodine.5 Although d’Aulnoy changes Straparola’s simple rise tale into  one of restoration, replacing the lowly born fool with an ugly prince, she  otherwise retains the basic plot of “Pietro the Fool”: a fish grants the fool’s  wishes, which allows the fool to trick and ultimately win the beautiful but  253 MT_28.2_02.indd   253 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="3"> MELISSA A. HOFMANN spurning princess as well as a kingdom for himself. Even though there are  slight revisions to the source material and much elaboration in d’Aulnoy’s  tale, the structure and details of Straparola’s plot are recognizable through- out, and the focus and sympathy remain with the male protagonist. The  only major fairy character in d’Aulnoy’s tale is the dark fairy, Grognette,  who, serving as a new antagonist, resembles the “old, ugly, poorly dressed,  and poorly housed” fairies who perform “base and childish” activities that  Murat condemns in her preface “To Modern Fairies” (Tucker and Siemens  129).6 A minor fairy character, who goes unnamed and undescribed, makes  a brief appearance to move the original plot along. Murat takes a completely different route. Although “Le Turbot” opens with  and follows almost identically the plot and characters of “Pietro the Fool,” the  story and the focus quickly shift from both the fool and the fish to the com- pletely new character of the fairy behind a much longer and complicated tale,  of which the fool’s story is a minor plot. About six times longer than Straparola’s  tale, “Le Turbot” uses “Pietro the Fool” as a springboard to tell the tale not of a  fool rising to the throne but of a powerful and benevolent female fairy correct- ing a wrong of which she is both the victim and the perpetrator, the tale’s dis- equilibrium resulting from her husband’s infidelity. This is a completely new  story of Murat’s invention with a new protagonist, the fairy Turbodine. Thus  Murat feminizes the tale, taking a story originally centered on a male character  and substituting a female heroine (Jasmin 371). Instead of a patrilineal ending,  Murat substitutes a female legacy, one that stems from a strong female ruler. Looking at Murat’s reworking of Straparola’s tale from the perspective of  the fairy Turbodine as the central figure answers the question of Raymonde  Robert, who in analyzing Murat’s divergence from Aarne-Thompson tale type  675 is puzzled by the “bizarre manner in which a fairy repays the fisherman  who saved his [the turbot’s] life by replacing him with another in the bed of  the princess” (Robert 130).7 In Murat’s tale the fool Mirou figures as a tangen- tial character; even the turbot has no actual power to grant Mirou’s wishes.  Rather, the fairy Turbodine confers that power on her husband the turbot in  order to protect him in his metamorphosed form, and the character of Mirou is  simply the means to an end serving Turbodine. Turbodine is unique as a fairy within both Murat’s own oeuvre and that of  her fellow women writers. Although other tales by Murat or the conteuses con- tain a fairy as the protagonist or a fairy that finds her love match at the end,  none of these fairies functions in the same way as Turbodine in the narrative of  “Le Turbot.” None of them simultaneously ensures her own happy fate while  helping to ensure that of the traditional heroic couple. For example, looking at  Murat’s tales, the unpublished “La Fée Princesse” features a fairy heroine, but  254 MT_28.2_02.indd   254 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="4"> THE FAIRY AS HERO(INE) her mother (the antagonist) and her governess (her helper) are also fairies. It is  the governess who acts as La Fée Princesse’s helper, reuniting her with the  prince Zélindor. In another of Murat’s unpublished contes, the dysphoric “Peine  Perdue,” the protagonist (Peine Perdue, daughter of a fairy) and the heroic  couple (Anarine and Isabel) are not the same; the plot focuses on the sad fate  of Peine Perdue, who is destined to be unhappy in love and for whom the  heroic couple functions as antagonists. As heroines, both La Fée Princesse and  Peine Perdue are quite traditional in that they need the intervention of the  helper fairy for success or, as in the case of Peine Perdue as the antiheroine, to  alleviate the pain of failure. In the works of Murat’s contemporaries the fairy  may function as the main character as well, but she tends to function either as  the antagonist, as in Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de La Force’s “Tourbillon,” or  she begins as the protagonist/heroine but becomes the antagonist/antiheroine,  as in Catherine Durand Bédacier’s “La Fée Lubantine.” Neither of these fairies  is triumphant in love in the end, as is Turbodine. In the Histoires sublimes and allégoriques itself, the second story, “L’Île de la  Magnificence,” appears to function as a prototype to “Le Turbot” in that its  fairy, Queen Plaisir, orchestrates multiple marriages and achieves a love match  of her own at the end, making herself one-half of a heroic couple. Yet Plaisir is  definitely not the heroine or even the focus of this similarly long and com- plexly layered tale in the same way that Turbodine is the focus and heroine of  “Le Turbot.” Even though the narrative makes it clear that Plaisir is driving the  action of the multiple storylines, she uses her adopted sons to resolve the vari- ous love plots, including her own, while she remains in the background.8 With  “Le Turbot,” the last story in the collection, Murat takes the fairy’s prominence  and dominance one step further, promoting her to the starring role of hero(ine),  whose power, though integrated in the tale, can be divided into contemporary  notions of male and female. Turbodine As Hero(ine) Turbodine features prominently in “Le Turbot,” and the fact that Turbodine  herself narrates for nearly half the tale (twenty-two out of forty-seven pages)  only increases her dominance all the more. She also exhibits the traits of the  other conteuses’ heroines, such as agency, beauty, and a perfect combination of  masculine and feminine qualities.9 But what qualifies Turbodine as the heroine  per se instead of the auxiliary fairy is that she is the main protagonist of the  story with her own arc and happy ending. Briefly, the tale revolves around the  consequences of Turbodine turning her husband, le roi de Coquerico, into a  fish (the turbot of the tale’s title) upon discovering his infidelity and the  255 MT_28.2_02.indd   255 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="5"> MELISSA A. HOFMANN consequences of her wishing to arrange a marriage for her husband’s brother  Fortuné. The unforeseen outcomes of these two events ultimately result in  Risette’s pregnancy and Fortuné’s transformation into a butterfly, two problems  that Turbodine works hard to resolve. Upon their resolution, Turbodine’s hus- band is restored to her, and the major and minor heroic couples of the tale,  whom she has worked to unite, marry and inherit the kingdoms she either  possesses, has conquered, or has saved. Murat seems to be playing with the conventions of fairy tales by combining  the hero, the heroine, and the fairy into one character. According to Vladimir  Propp’s morphology, a fairy tale has seven dramatis personae defined by their  functions in spheres of action. These include “the hero,” “the villain,” “the  donor (provider),” “the helper,” and “the princess (a sought-for person) and her  father” (79–80).10 Raymonde Robert effectively modifies Propp’s cast of charac- ters when formulating what is unique about the French fairy tale. In place of  Propp’s separate heroes and princess-objects, for Robert a defining characteris- tic of the late-seventeenth-century and early-eighteenth-century contes de fées is  the existence of the exemplary heroic couple who are destined to marry one  another, with the hero and heroine and their respective helpers united on the  good side of the plot and the antihero, antiheroine, and other antagonists united  on the bad side, with both moral and physical attributes distinguishing who  belongs to which side (Robert 35). In the traditional structure of a French fairy  tale, the fairy’s role is that of the donor/helper or villain to the plot’s hero (prince)  and heroine (princess). Because Turbodine fits this description, she has tradi- tionally been passed off as an auxiliary character (Murat, Contes, 474). As Geneviève Patard describes, however, the characters in Murat’s tales  are notorious for their refusal of conventional boundaries. Murat’s fairy-tale  protagonists are not neatly divided into their conventional roles of heroes,  opponents, and assistants. The heroic couple are often not the protagonists of  the tale, and the function of these characters frequently evolves (e.g., from  donor/helper to villain) (Murat, Contes, 39–40). Propp asserts that “functions  of characters serve as stable, constant elements in a tale, independent of how  and by whom they are fulfilled” (21). This means that a particular character  can serve in more than one role simultaneously, because it is the function of the  character that it is important, not the specific person who fills it. Thus the fact  that Turbodine fulfills the function of auxiliary fairy to the major and minor  heroic couples in the tale does not preclude her from also being its heroine  and for acting on her own behalf with her own fairy powers. In fact, Turbodine displaces the heroic couple of Risette and Fortuné as the  main protagonist of the tale, for not only does she repair the misdeed perpetrated  on Fortuné by the jealous fairy Mandarine, but she also repairs the misdeed  256 MT_28.2_02.indd   256 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="6"> THE FAIRY AS HERO(INE) perpetrated on herself (her husband’s infidelity) by turning le roi de Coquerico  into a fish as punishment—two actions that are inextricably intertwined. If it  were not for Mirou catching her fish-husband and wishing for Risette’s preg- nancy, Turbodine would not have found a way to disenchant Fortuné; conversely,  if Mandarine had not transformed Fortuné into a butterfly with such particular  conditions for his release, then Turbodine would not have been able to ethically  fulfill Mirou’s wish. Hence the plot originates in Turbodine’s disequilibrium,  which is caused by her husband’s faithlessness and revolves around her subse- quent hasty decision to punish her husband for twenty years; her amelioratory  measures ultimately allow for the union of the traditional heroic couple of Risette  and Fortuné and for the reunion of the superficially heroic couple that Turbodine  forms with le roi de Coquerico. Furthermore, Turbodine plays a role in Fortuné’s  metamorphosis, for Fortuné is afraid to ask for Turbodine’s help in rescuing  Merline because he has already declined to marry Bluette, whom Turbodine has  chosen for him and whom he does not love. Thus, although Turbodine acts as  the helper fairy to the stricken Fortuné, Fortuné adopts the role of helper to  Turbodine in turn. His plight enables her to keep her husband safe until his  twenty-year sentence expires and to stay true to her fairy oaths. Masculine Powers and Heroism Turbodine’s male-associated powers include ruling and bestowing kingdoms,  waging war, and arranging marriages. Thus she possesses both the royal and the  familial pouvoir du père. This power, coupled with Turbodine’s assistance to  every male character in the tale, especially to the traditional hero Fortuné,  works to undermine masculine agency and power. Turbodine’s masculine  exploits also highlight the myth of self-sufficient masculinity, that is, a masculin- ity that exists without the interpretation and projection of its ideals by women  (Seifert, Fairy Tales, 173). Not only is Murat as woman author interpreting mas- culinity and projecting it onto Turbodine, but also Turbodine enacts masculinity  herself, having it projected onto her by the feminized would-be heroes in the  tale. In fact, Murat substitutes Turbodine in the place of patriarchal authority  (Clermidy-Patard 123–24), making her the tale’s hero, with her own masculine  goals of conquest and control, instead of merely the traditional hero’s helper.11 Strong fairy queen versus weak kings In “Le Turbot” Murat uses the same strategy as d’Aulnoy to discredit male fig- ures by contrasting the roles and authority granted to her heroine Turbodine to  the weak kings of le roi de Coquerico and Lucidan. A weak king implies not  257 MT_28.2_02.indd   257 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="7"> MELISSA A. HOFMANN only that he is not the hero but also that, incapable of ruling his kingdom, he is  an impotent father and spouse, because the king was the symbolic father of the  people (Jasmin 351–68). Compared to the two kings, Turbodine is both more  powerful and more virile: it is she who rules and she who defends and con- quers kingdoms. These activities immediately mark her as male, for despite  the femme fortes of history, the regent queens, and the women of the Fronde,  the antiwoman side of the long-standing Querelle de femmes argued that women  were incapable and unfit to rule because of their inherent psychological and  physical weaknesses.12 Even the apologists in favor of women rulers, while  acknowledging the restrictions placed on women in a male-controlled society,  advanced their argument by appealing to women’s nonphysical virtues or her  differences from men (Ronzeaud). Yet Turbodine is the queen, who possesses  these “male” qualities without narrative comment and without the need for  cross-dressing (as in the case of Murat’s Constantine or d’Aulnoy’s Belle-Belle)  or metamorphosis (as with d’Aulnoy’s Chatte Blanche or Aimée).13 This is sig- nificant and makes Turbodine unique among the conteuses’ virile heroines. First, the narrative legitimizes Turbodine’s power by making her the “sole  heir” of L’Île des Roches,14 a flourishing kingdom left to her by her parents that  she rules through a “long succession” of family ownership (Murat, Contes,  319). This is noteworthy, because in French society Salic law prohibited  women from inheriting property and the throne.15 The fact that she is sole heir  softens this illegality somewhat, but at the same time Turbodine’s parents are  mentioned collectively, as though they have equal ruling power. What is strik- ing is that Turbodine’s king father is never mentioned anywhere in the story,  whereas her fairy queen mother is mentioned twice. Thus Turbodine is pre- sented as clearly a female ruler, with a female legacy. This heightens the differ- ences, discussed later in this essay, between her and the male kings and princes  in the tale. Second, Turbodine is presented as superior to the male rulers seeking  her hand and to le roi de Coquerico, whom she marries for love, even though  his state is less wealthy than hers. Whereas her kingdom is rich in precious  stones and metals, amber, crystal, and pearls, le roi de Coquerico’s kingdom  is “little” (était peu de chose) in contrast: “the commerce of the people being  only flowers” (Murat, Contes, 319–20).16 Turbodine even states that she is  rich enough not to need her husband’s lands, which she plans to bestow  upon his brother Fortuné (Murat, Contes, 323). Thus le roi de Coquerico is  feminized as soon as he is introduced, both by his association with flowers,  usually associated with women, and by a wife richer than him and in control  of the disposition of his lands. This feminization further continues with his  extreme distress at Turbodine’s separation from him when she leaves to help  258 MT_28.2_02.indd   258 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="8"> THE FAIRY AS HERO(INE) a neighboring prince in trouble, which typically is the role of a male ruler.  Although she  experiences a lot of pain, he acts as though he were going to die  (Murat, Contes, 320).17 Because only Turbodine’s aid can help the afflicted  prince, le roi de Coquerico stays behind, acting the part of the woman emo- tionally and physically. Third, the narrative further shows Turbodine’s dominance over le roi de  Coquerico when she turns him into a fish upon discovering him being unfaith- ful to her with Bluette, a neighboring princess. Returning home from assisting  a prince in need, Turbodine witnesses this scene of infidelity as she searches  for a place to stop her war horses, a detail that reminds the reader of her  power.18 As in d’Aulnoy’s tales, the “assumption of animal form entails a dis- tinct loss of power” where the “anthropomorphic royal male is disabled and  often ridiculed” (Hannon 88). Even though le roi de Coquerico does not have  much power in the first place relative to Turbodine, he is certainly further  demasculinized as a fish, especially because he depends on Turbodine for  speech and protection. Le roi de Coquerico is also weak in his protestation of  innocence, when he claims he was surprised by Bluette’s advances (Murat,  Contes, 322). Even in seduction, women control him. Most compellingly,  Turbodine gets to punish her husband for his infidelity, because in the real  world of the conteuses, women had no recourse for a cheating spouse: only a  man could bring charges against a woman for adultery, not vice versa, because  marriage was an affair of property and a woman’s adultery could result in  property being distributed to bastard children (DeJean, Tender Geographies,  152, 258n29). The further twist here is that Turbodine is the one with prop- erty in her marriage. And ultimately, when le roi de Coquerico’s twenty-year sentence finally  expires and Turbodine returns him to his human form, she welcomes him “to  take again the place you are due in my heart and on my throne (Murat, Contes,  348; emphasis mine).19 While the cheering people may cry “Long live King  Turbot and Queen Turbodine!”20 it is clear that Turbodine is the real ruler  (Murat, Contes, 349). Hence le roi de Coquerico’s name is ironic or mocking:  he is far from the domineering rooster implied by his name, with its implica- tions of ruling on a smaller scale than a kingdom, and he has no victory of  which to sing.21 In fact, le roi de Coquerico does not even speak in the tale. He  has no direct dialogue, and his speech and actions are always reported through  either Turbodine or the narrator; even his explanation of infidelity is reported  indirectly to Turbodine through the medium of a halcyon sent to protect the  fish-king. Thus Turbodine and le roi de Coquerico are the epitome of the pop- ular fear of “the world upside down,”22 where men are in a “state of domestic  submission” and women take up arms and politics (Ronzeaud 9). 259 MT_28.2_02.indd   259 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="9"> MELISSA A. HOFMANN Lucidan is also the feminized, weak king to Turbodine. Suffering from  grief after exiling Risette and thus not on his guard, he flees when the neigh- boring king and queen, Grimaut and Grimasse, invade. It is Turbodine who  acts not only to get Lucidan reinstated on his throne but also to avenge the  attack and seize Grimaut’s kingdom in turn. First, in absentia in her own  kingdom, Turbodine initiates war, ordering Fortuné to “go reestablish the  king your father-in-law in his lands,” providing him with “a fleet equipped  with everything necessary” (Murat, Contes, 344).23 In contrast, and as befits  the prince of the traditional heroic couple, Fortuné accomplishes this task,  but only at the command and with the aid of Turbodine. While Fortuné  performs “an infinite number of noble deeds”24 in recapturing the kingdom,  nothing is said of Lucidan, who seems to have only gone along for the ride  (Murat, Contes, 344). Second, with Lucidan passively restored to his throne and the now prodi- gal Fortuné gambling away his fortune at his own palace, it is up to Turbodine  to take revenge on Grimaut on Lucidan’s behalf. When she informs Fortuné  and Lucidan of the imminent arrival of a fleet to do so, Lucidan submits to  Turbodine, saying that “she was the mistress” (Murat, Contes, 346).25 This time  Turbodine is on board for the fight, joined by Fortuné and his son Princillon.  Significantly again, Lucidan is absent, his revenge overseen and enacted by  Turbodine. It is she who chases and turns the usurpers into stone, forever  immobilizing them; she then returns to Caprare to inform Lucidan “of that  which she had done” only after “she had given the orders necessary to keep her  conquest” (Murat, Contes, 347; emphases mine).26 Thus the narrative makes it  clear that it is Turbodine—not Lucidan or even his son-in-law Fortuné—who  is the restorer and conqueror of kingdoms. Turbodine, the fairy queen, is the  hero king. Word equals action: authoring plot The power of the fairy in the conteuses’ tales is like that of the absolute king.  What she decrees happens immediately; the power of her words reigns  supreme. The fairy has the power to create reality, through both stating an  action and by naming heroes for the traits they possess by means of the gift she  has granted them (Jasmin 383–84). In the case of Turbodine, she names the  titular antihero for the punishment granted to him by her. The plot of “Le  Turbot” thus turns on the omnipotence and immediacy of the fairy’s word,  both Turbodine’s and the opposing fairy’s, Mandarine. Soon after Turbodine  orders her husband to become a turbot and touches him with her wand, she  regrets her action but cannot undo it because the term of twenty years she has  260 MT_28.2_02.indd   260 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="10"> THE FAIRY AS HERO(INE) imposed cannot be revoked (Murat, Contes, 321). This sets off the chain of  events that links all the subplots of the tale together, as Turbodine finds a way  to both protect her husband and fulfill the conditions of Mandarine’s punish- ment on Fortuné. Like Louis XIV, Turbodine uses exile to punish her husband  for his crime.27 Significantly, his identity as turbot, which Turbodine has cre- ated for him, sticks at the end of the tale: When returned to his human form at  last, the people hail him as “King Turbot” (Murat, Contes, 349), an identity also  reinforced by the title of the tale itself. Thus both the king’s crime and his  weakness in relation to Turbodine’s power are emphasized. Also significant is  that the narrator consistently refers to the fairy as “Turbodine” (“because that is  what she is called”)28 (Murat, Contes, 311), although independently from her  husband she is “la reine de l’île des Roches”29 (Murat, Contes, 319), a title that  precedes the first section of the tale narrated by Turbodine herself. This means  that although Turbodine is a ruler of her own kingdom, she is defined by and  known for her action of turning her husband into a fish—that act (and her con- trol over her husband) have become an integral part of her identity, with her  name a constant reminder of that power. Mandarine even once refers obliquely  to Turbodine as the “reine de Coquerico,” which, while identifying her with  her husband’s kingdom and not her own, also reminds the reader that  Turbodine is queen while her husband is a fish and underscores that Turbodine  is the ruler of her husband (Murat, Contes, 329). Le roi de Coquerico/the tur- bot is never referred to as “le roi de l’île des Roches,” which again reinforces  Turbodine as the dominant figure in the couple. The power of the fairy’s (male) word is also demonstrated when Turbodine  tells Lucidan they will attack Grimaut’s kingdom in revenge. Lucidan responds,  “That she only had to give her orders, and they would be punctually followed”  (Murat, Contes, 346–47).30 There is no fairy magic involved here or threat; it is  only the authority of Turbodine herself that commands Lucidan’s acceptance.  Likewise, Fortuné submits to Turbodine’s will, despite his great impatience, as  she works to free him from his butterfly form through her various deceptions:  “He obeyed me always, and he found it so beneficial to abandon himself to my  command that he did nothing without my ordering it” (Murat, Contes, 340).31  Throughout the tale action takes place at the command of Turbodine, either by  word or a wave of her magic wand. The ultimate demonstration of fairy word into action, but one that takes a  lot more planning and manipulation on Turbodine’s part, is the dream mar- riage of Risette and Fortuné. Here Turbodine creates a reality so ridiculous that  Risette believes it is a dream, but the fairy’s authority to proclaim and consum- mate this marriage, even without the requisite parental or kingly consent, is a  testament to her male power.32 It also shows her skill as an author, who  261 MT_28.2_02.indd   261 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="11"> MELISSA A. HOFMANN cunningly casts the roles in this scenario to ensure the marriage’s ultimate  legitimacy. Although disguised as Risette’s mother and using the husband of  another fairy to play Lucidan, Turbodine is acting as Risette’s father (and thus  as her sovereign), forcing her marriage. Conflicted over the deception,  Turbodine is ultimately pleased with her prowess, for her plan succeeds  (Murat, Contes, 339). Textual Deflection of Male Heroic Power For all the examples of Turbodine’s male power just discussed, the text itself  superficially tries to distract from it. The most prominent example is  Turbodine’s immediate regret and subsequent extreme distress over the  metamorphosis of her husband, which can be seen as a narrative punish- ment for her rash act. Ruth Bottigheimer identifies anger as a defining char- acteristic of AT 675 and states that “anger is the prerogative of authority  figures, whose authority is often constituted by their maleness,” whereas  “women . . . are not allowed to express anger in these tales” (“Luckless,”  266–67). Thus, although Turbodine may be punished for her male anger  and power, these two attributes also drive the entire plot of the tale, without  which there is no story. Other examples of narrative deflection of her masculine prerogative  involve Turbodine remaining ostensibly within a female role, as when she dis- guises herself as Risette’s mother in the dream wedding. In proving the validity  of Risette’s dream marriage to Fortuné, Turbodine calls in the authority of the  male druid who was present, thus legitimizing her actions. Male authority is  summoned again in the form of Mirou, whom Turbodine uses as a witness to  Risette’s propriety, granting him reason—popularly conceived as a male attri- bute—to do so.33 Although it is Turbodine who acts to get Lucidan reinstated  and avenged, the plan is executed along with the appropriate male stand-ins of  Fortuné and Princillon. Turbodine’s specific acts in this revenge, beyond turn- ing Grimaut and Grimasse into stone, are unspecified and thus bloodless. The  particular help that Turbodine provides to her neighboring prince at the begin- ning of the tale also goes unmentioned. Leaving Turbodine’s acts of aggression  vague lessens the impact of her virile qualities. Further counterbalancing Turbodine’s wielding of male power is the fact  that the result of all her machinations is happiness in love. Love is the accepted  domain of women and the focus of the conteuses’ tales (Raynard 239–60), and  Turbodine uses all her powers in pursuit of it, for herself and others. While  pursuing her ultimate goal of keeping her husband safe in anticipation of their  reunion, Turbodine arranges the love matches of the major and minor heroic  262 MT_28.2_02.indd   262 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="12"> THE FAIRY AS HERO(INE) couples in the tale: Risette and Fortuné, Princillette and Brillantin, and  Princillon and Fleurbelle. Never mind that in the process she conquers  Grimaut’s kingdom and annexes that of the adulterer Bluette, because, in the  end, she distributes these kingdoms among them. Finally, the conte is titled “Le Turbot” and not “Turbodine,” which seem- ingly places the emphasis on the plight of le roi de Coquerico. Murat perhaps  is playing on the tale as a restoration plot as envisioned by d’Aulnoy with “Le  Dauphin,” with the royal turbot losing and then regaining his crown; however,  “King Turbot” is a passive participant throughout, thoroughly eclipsed by  Turbodine. The title is simply a subtle way of showing Turbodine’s strength  while also emphasizing the problem of infidelity. Invoking Fate: Limitation or Empowerment? Another way in which Turbodine’s male power is disguised in the tale is the  foil of fate or destiny. As in other stories by Murat, fate in the service of love,  whether it results in a happy or unhappy ending, checks the power of the fairy  and is acknowledged by the fairy as a limitation she cannot overcome.34 This  notion of the limitation of a fairy’s powers, especially limitation by the dictates  of fate, becomes curious when we look at the etymology of the word fée, which  is “traced to the Latin feminine word fata, variant of fatum referring to the god- dess of ‘fate,’ but also to fatum, past participle of fari, ‘to speak, reveal, bear  witness.’ Speaking the fate that the folk- or fairy-tale narrative acknowledges  from the outset, fairies wield considerable power” (Seifert, Fairy Tales, 198). Fairies, by their definition, would thus seem to be determiners of fate, but  the fairies in Murat’s stories explicitly state that they are helpless to change fate,  and the protagonists and heroic couples meet their destined ends despite the  fairies’ deliberate interventions. Taken at face value, the same limitation would  appear to be true for Turbodine: “Fate stronger than my art rendered me pow- erless,”35 she states when she cannot undo her husband’s metamorphosis, and  later in the tale’s chronological timeline the turbot explains to an angry Risette  that “fate has a greater part in your misfortune than me” (Murat, Contes, 321,  309).36 The narrative explicitly supplies examples of Turbodine’s supposed  powerlessness. Yet Turbodine, unlike Murat’s similarly curtailed fairies, is  effectual in resolving the plot of the tale happily, after an interesting interplay  between her own powers and the dictates of fate. Turbodine exemplifies both root meanings of fée: not only is she the driv- ing force behind all of the events—what she says happens—but she is also the  primary teller of the tale, bearing witness to all that has happened. Even  though fate has been said to represent the woman writer, who must set limits  263 MT_28.2_02.indd   263 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="13"> MELISSA A. HOFMANN to the fairy’s power so that there can be the plot of a misdeed and its reparation  (Jasmin 388–89), the role of fate in “Le Turbot” works within the text itself to  disguise the actual power of the fairy in driving the plot forward, a plot in  which a woman sovereign reigns supreme, especially over the male characters.  The fairy—especially this fairy, Turbodine, who is actively authoring this tale  and her own fate—represents the woman writer. Yet the fairy must at the same  time necessarily submit to her author’s whims (Jasmin 389), just as the con- teuses had to camouflage the subversive précieux ideas of their plots within the  framework of the playful, not-to-be-taken-seriously conte de fées. In another  light, one could argue that Turbodine ultimately succeeds because destiny has  already decreed the love matches in the tale. As Geneviève Clermidy-Patard  points out, for Murat, destiny is another term for love, and love is a superior  power to patriarchal authority (128–29). Thus Murat is able to both acknowl- edge and subvert masculine authority with the same device, simultaneously  disguising Turbodine’s power with the very means that allows it to triumph. To  the uninitiated, Turbodine’s power is (at least superficially) checked; for the  circle of conteuses and their privileged audiences, both foil and fairy have the  same goal and are one. Several other passages throughout the tale explicitly mention destiny’s  hand, and all ultimately have to do with a love match. When Risette first con- sciously meets Turbodine, Turbodine introduces her to her husband thusly:  “Beautiful princess, there he is whom fate arranges for you to take for your  husband.” In the next paragraph Turbodine enjoins both Risette and Fortuné  to accompany her to their new home: “Let us go and leave this inhospitable  place in order to bring you to the palace destined to you” (Murat, Contes, 311;  emphases mine).37 When Turbodine is struggling to find a way to simultane- ously grant Mirou’s wish and disenchant Fortuné, she realizes that “this adven- ture . . . appeared to me thus an effect of the drive of destiny, which had taken  this way to make Mandarine’s impossible subjugations possible, and to get me  out of the commitment to my oaths” (Murat, Contes, 334; emphasis mine).38  However, Turbodine goes to such extraordinary lengths to legitimately marry  the heroic couple and rescue Fortuné that the narrative detail of her elaborate  machinations far exceeds the few lines about the role of fate on her power.  Turbodine even claims control for herself: when concluding the story of  Risette’s adventures, she tells Risette, “I then prepared all things to put to an  end to that which I had so fortunately begun” (Murat, Contes, 340; emphasis  mine).39 Although the plan she concocted may indeed seem like it was formu- lated by destiny—even destiny as love—Turbodine claims full credit for it. The narrative even juxtaposes the power of fate with the power of  Turbodine herself. Following the sentence in which Turbodine introduces  264 MT_28.2_02.indd   264 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="14"> THE FAIRY AS HERO(INE) Risette to her destined husband (quoted earlier) is this one, addressed to  Fortuné: “Come receive from my hand this kind princess for your wife” (Murat,  Contes, 311; emphasis mine).40 Here it is clear that Turbodine is actively giving  Fortuné to Risette. There is an interesting gender dynamic here as well: fate  gives the female her husband, but Turbodine gives the male his wife. Turbodine  is Fate personified for Fortuné, who, like all the other men in the tale, has his  fate controlled (i.e., authored) by a woman. By the end of the tale, there is a reversal in the hierarchy of fate over fairy  in the narrative itself, as destiny is now seen to be acting in accord with  Turbodine’s wishes, for reciprocal love has bloomed in the hearts of Brillantin  and Princillette, whom she wishes to have marry (Murat, Contes, 348).41 Fate  is now favoring Turbodine’s love match, which contrasts with Turbodine’s fail- ure in the beginning of the tale to match Fortuné and Bluette. By invoking the controlling hand of fate, the narrative explicitly excuses  any possible critique of Turbodine: her extreme punishment of le roi de  Coquerico, the scandalous way in which she impregnates Risette, or the  authority she assumes in marrying Risette and Fortuné. Although submission  to fate is another disguise for Turbodine’s exercise of male prerogative, it is a  weak one, as Turbodine’s actions show her to be in control. And tellingly, there  is no appeal to fate while she is attacking or avenging kingdoms. Even though  the dark fairy Mandarine erroneously pronounces to Fortuné that she will  always be mistress of his destiny (Murat, Contes, 332), Turbodine is the mis- tress—and author—of her fate and everyone else’s in the tale (even  Mandarine’s), despite the claims of submission to destiny. If love is superior to  patriarchal authority and Turbodine as fairy is equated with the fate that is also  equated with love, then Turbodine is also greater than patriarchal authority. Female Knowledge and Authorship Power and knowledge in “Le Turbot” are coded as feminine, even if much of  Turbodine’s power is associated with masculinity, because both come from the  hands of women. For example, Turbodine receives the fairy art through her  mother,42 and she also looks to her mother’s notes and books when trying to  solve the moral dilemma of impregnating Risette. And at the end of the tale,  Turbodine passes on her fairy knowledge—and her narrative legacy—to her  chosen heir, Princillette, “to whom such astonishing things occurred that they  will one day make a most pleasant story,”43 just like the story of Turbodine that  the narrator—and Turbodine herself—has just told (Murat, Contes, 349). It is  also to Princillette (and only by default to Brillantin, who has no other narra- tive function than to be Princillette’s husband) that Turbodine leaves her own  265 MT_28.2_02.indd   265 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="15"> MELISSA A. HOFMANN kingdoms, which include those of her husband and Bluette. The promise of  women’s power—and storytelling—thus continues down the generations.44 Turbodine also controls the disclosure of knowledge in the tale, a form of  power and authorship in itself. For example, she reveals to Risette the whole of  Risette’s adventures in two parts, thus not giving her the complete story at  once. The first time is at the request of Risette, who, rescued, married, and  pregnant with Princillette, wants to know the backstory of the fish behind her  adventures. At this point, Turbodine tells Risette of le roi de Coquerico’s treach- ery and transformation, revealing only that prince Fortuné is not Mirou trans- formed. The revelation of Princillon’s paternity—and thus the story of Fortuné  and of Risette’s impregnation—is delayed until after the birth of Princillette: “It  is time that I let you know the outcome of all your adventures” (Murat, Contes,  323; emphasis mine).45 Although this is partly because of the terms of  Mandarine’s spell on Fortuné (he will be released from his butterfly form only  after the birth of his daughter), such secrecy is not logically necessary for the  narrative, because the spell is well on its way to being broken (Risette is preg- nant with Princillette) and, moreover, Turbodine has found a way to keep  Fortuné’s human form for all but two hours a day. Turbodine thus could have  chosen to tell Risette the whole story the first time but chooses to wait. Risette  has no idea of her husband’s butterfly state, thanks to Turbodine’s fairy skill,  enabling Turbodine to keep that secret as well and to reveal it at her will.  Turbodine is thus the creator of both Risette’s external and internal reality,  authoring her identity. Further, the revelation of knowledge between Turbodine and Risette is given  the aura of secrecy. Turbodine draws Risette aside privately in her quarters, and  “after she was enclosed there with her,” tells her the story of Fortuné and the  dream marriage (Murat, Contes, 323; emphasis mine).46 Even though Turbodine  trusts Fortuné with the secrets that allow him to participate in the dream mar- riage, she keeps the knowledge of Risette’s suffering from him to spare his feel- ings. She tells Risette, “I shared [your pains] with you without his knowing”  (Murat, Contes, 340).47 Women’s pain is thus transformed into secret (female)  knowledge, which plays to the contemporary male conception of the salon as a  place of women’s secrets, with its preoccupation with matters of love and mar- riage: although the salon was “‘public’ to the extent that conversation and various  forms of belles lettres were ‘published’ there, its feminocentric character lent it an  association with the secret or private” (Harth 182). With Risette as Turbodine’s  primary audience for the tale, Murat reinforces the primacy of a female commu- nity of authors and readers suggested by her preface, “To Modern Fairies.” The postponement of knowledge is also reflected in the narrative itself in  the very naming of Turbodine. When Risette—and the reader—are introduced  266 MT_28.2_02.indd   266 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="16"> THE FAIRY AS HERO(INE) to her character, she is first “a lady of a surprising beauty and magnificence”  and then “the fairy . . . [who] was one of the most powerful.” Finally, a page  and a half later, she is referred to as “la fée Turbodine” (Murat, Contes, 309– 11).48 The delay in the revelation of her specific identity anticipates Turbodine’s  own narrative withholding. Turbodine thus is a stand-in for the woman writer,  Murat herself, in the crafty chronology of the tale. Fairy as Author/Author as Fairy Just as d’Aulnoy in “La Chatte blanche” “has transformed a tale about a wandering  prince into a tale about a powerful princess, whose storytelling, both written and  oral, is part of her power” (Harries 43), so also has Murat in “Le Turbot” trans- formed a tale about a male fool and a male wish-granting fish into a tale about the  powerful female fairy behind the wish granting, who possesses the same storytell- ing power. In actively narrating over half of the fairy tale, Turbodine is as much  the author of “Le Turbot” as she is its heroine, informing its characters of the plot  while speaking as others. She simultaneously fills in the reader and Risette on not  only Turbodine’s own history but also the stories of both Prince Fortuné and  Risette, which are linked with hers. In telling Fortuné’s story, she recreates his  first-person dialogue, thus appropriating his voice. Recounting to Risette how it  was that Risette became pregnant, Turbodine presents her with the sequence of  events leading up to and behind that which Risette herself only experienced haz- ily as a dream. Risette’s own memory of the events is but poorly integrated into  her identity until Turbodine reveals what only Turbodine, as orchestrator, can  know. Risette’s new narrative knowledge only increases her happiness and respect  for Turbodine, regardless of the fact that Turbodine played an integral part in  Risette’s previous misfortunes. The relationship between Risette and Turbodine mirrors that between the  conteuse and her muse, the fairy, as illustrated both in the frontispiece of  d’Aulnoy’s Les Contes des fées, where the fairy and the noblewoman are in pri- vate communication, and in the meaning of the collection’s title: “tales of the  fairies” (Jones, “Poetics,” 66–67). Although the fairy acts as the muse for the  woman writer, the fairy Turbodine acts as the author of Risette’s destiny.  Risette’s story is literally a “tale of the fairy” Turbodine, told as well as created  by her. And Murat is the ultimate fairy; as Clermidy-Patard remarks, Murat  reuses Straparola’s text to better trick the reader, who is manipulated as  Turbodine manipulates the naïve Risette (Murat, Contes, 453), especially with  the unexpected inversion of the misdeed and its reparation in the tale  (Clermidy-Patard 219), for Turbodine’s own story is created and told by  Turbodine herself. 267 MT_28.2_02.indd   267 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="17"> MELISSA A. HOFMANN In addition to orally recounting the events to the story’s main characters,  Turbodine also has the story written down to preserve its details for the  masses, who have also already heard it: “Everyone in the kingdom of Caprare  already knew the amazing story of Prince Fortuné and Princess Risette, but to  make sure everything would be known by everyone, she had it printed”  (Murat, Contes, 347).49 Interestingly, Turbodine also uses a living witness to  substantiate the story: Mirou the fool, whom she brings back from exile.  Granting him reason, she also conserves “the memory of all that happened, so  that he could be an irreproachable witness to the princess’ modesty” (Murat,  Contes, 347).50 This last bit of authoring on Turbodine’s part warrants exami- nation. On the one hand, Turbodine molds a man to suit her purposes, creat- ing a whole new identity for him; on the other hand, she rewards him with  riches and a place in Lucidan’s court as recompense. Is Turbodine buying  Mirou’s testimony, his good word? It appears that a woman’s word, either oral  or written, is not enough in defending a woman’s reputation. Despite all that  she has achieved, Turbodine still needs a man’s (oral) testimony to secure the  good name of Risette. This is an interesting twist on the status of women’s stories in Murat’s  France, where (lower-class) women were associated with the oral fairy tale, not  the written, and men like Perrault paradoxically appropriated the female oral  voice to sound more authentic but legitimized the stories—and thus the  genre—by writing them down as men (Jones, “Poetics,” 61; Harries 47–55). In  “Le Turbot” the fairy and sovereign queen is the originator and first distributor  of the story, not a Mother Goose or a nurse. Turbodine herself writes it down,  or rather has it printed for her, presumably controlling the message. Mirou,  although now risen through Turbodine’s intervention, functions with both the  authority of a lower-class “old wife” or ma mère L’Oye and the authority of a  man, much like Perrault in his Histoires ou contes du temps passé, except that  Mirou’s testimony is oral, not written. Murat is thus playing here with conven- tions of authority in storytelling, both in terms of class and gender.51 And,  even though Turbodine has professedly recorded the “story of prince Fortuné  and the princess Risette” for posterity, that story has the powerful fairy queen  Turbodine as its central figure and author. Noémi Hepp notes that one of the  measures of male heroism is public acknowledgment of the hero’s exploits  (14). Turbodine works toward this hallmark with the publication of her tale,  although she does so in the service of Fortuné and Risette. Thus does Turbodine  push her way invisibly but invariably into history, as do Constantine and the  fairy Obligeantine in Murat’s “Le Sauvage,” which links Turbodine as well to  the “many women novelists and fairy-tale writers who preferred anonymity to  signing” their names to their works (Hannon 207). But just as those in the  268 MT_28.2_02.indd   268 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="18"> THE FAIRY AS HERO(INE) intended audience of the fairy tales knew the identity of authors regardless of  elliptical signing (Hannon 169; Seifert, “Fées,” 139), it is clear to the reader  whom the tale of Risette and Fortuné, or the tale “Le Turbot,” is truly about. Correspondingly, Turbodine, with her simultaneous male power and limi- tation or disguise of that power, is a representation of the woman writer.  Although the fairy power of creating reality is reflective of the real influence of  the conteuses and salonnières in the promotion of male authors and artists in  mondain society, as well as in setting the standards of literary appreciation and  developing the French language,52 that influence was predicated on essential- ized notions of women’s “natural,” “instinctual” abilities of good taste and  judgment in social affairs and literature, in contrast to rational “male” thought  and acquired learning. Although praised for being superior, women’s abilities  were thus tied to their biology and reproductive abilities (Hannon 43). Even  though the conteuses had a certain power within their milieu because of their  sanctioned ignorance and privileged feminine graces, they could not entirely  escape the restrictions placed on them as women in a society that increasingly  limited the role of women to their “proper” duties of wifehood and mother- hood and in which the rule of the father was both divinely and politically  sanctioned. As Joan DeJean has noted, the entry of women into the literary  field further intensified the debate about women and was a driver of the  Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns (“(Literary) World,” 125). While safe  “publishing” in the semipublic sphere of the salon,53 the conteuses had to be  more careful with the printed word, for not only was it against the tenets of  bienséance to sign one’s name as nobility, but women writers also had the added  burden of being women, for whom it was “unseemly . . . to acknowledge the  fruit of their intellectual labor” (Seifert, “Fées,” 138). And even though fairy  tales were popular with the reading public, they were ridiculed as inferior,  frivolous, or immoral by the official literary establishment.54 The French liter- ary academies may have awarded the conteuses prizes, but they denied women  membership, for the art of conversation and novels were the realm of women  but science and philosophy were decidedly that of men.55 Further, women’s  writing, with its aims to redefine love and marriage, was seen to be subversive  to the nation-state, whose foundation rested on the distribution of power and  wealth to families headed by men (DeJean, Tender Geographies, 14; Harth 189). In this context Murat’s disguising the male powers of Turbodine by evok- ing the limits of destiny and counteracting them with the pursuit of love, as  well as her burying in the subplots such precious concepts such as reciprocity  in love, can be seen as an example of women’s double and triple layering of  meaning to get their work past the censor (Hannon 165). Under the guise of  a frivolous fairy tale and by using narrative strategies that downplay Turbodine’s  269 MT_28.2_02.indd   269 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="19"> MELISSA A. HOFMANN actions, Murat can unapologetically show a sovereign woman and i ndependent  wife, whose existence was impossible in her own time, for by “assuming a  name that offered them an etymological parentage with the mythological  Parques, women fairy-tale writers implicitly claim the authority to invent alter- native destinies” (Hannon 143). Conclusion Turbodine’s prominence, plot-creating actions, and narrative revelations make  her the true hero, heroine, and author of “Le Turbot,” dominating and trium- phant. As a hero(ine), author, and fairy, she is the ultimate representative of the  woman writer, who is master of her narrative universe and powerful in her  literary sphere of influence. Turbodine is Murat’s strongest and most positive  fairy and heroine, and she truly embodies the qualities contained within  Murat’s preface, where “giving . . . clarity to the most obscure things” refers to  both Turbodine as narrator of a complexly woven tale and to Murat, who  encodes subversive ideas of a powerful, independent woman in a “sublime and  allegorical” tale.56 Patard asks whether Murat contradicts her preface by explicitly excluding  fairies from her last published conte, “Le Père et ses quatres fils” (contained in  her novel Le Voyage de Compagne), offering that fairies reveal narrative artifice  and confirming the allegorical nature of the “modern fairy.” She also notes that  the preface is meant not only to distinguish her fellow women writers but to  incite them to participate in shaping a progressive future (Patard 277–78).  Hannon concurs with the forward-looking aspect when discussing the tales  overall: the conteuses’ “prophetic fables create an exploratory space to prepare  aristocratic women and their associates for an as yet undefined future in a  changing society” (16). Perhaps Turbodine is a strong enough projection of the woman writer,  amply internalized by the Murat who created her, that Murat no longer needed  the figure of the fairy in crafting her next novel and the fairy tale within.  Indeed, there is evidence that Murat was re-envisioning the role of the author  in the context of the salon and the literary field. Allison Stedman notes that  Murat’s move from fairy tales to ghost tales in Le Voyage de Compagne signals  that Murat is confident enough to challenge the social institutions of the ancien  régime more directly, in the setting of an everyday reality, not a marvelous one  (Introduction, 17). Further, Murat’s reclamation and presentation in her novel  of the proverb comedy—a once subversive salon game appropriated by the  Court as a vehicle for absolutist ideological reinforcement—reveals a shift  away from collective, oral authoring and performance to individual authoring  270 MT_28.2_02.indd   270 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="20"> THE FAIRY AS HERO(INE) and solitary reading (Stedman, “Rococo Fiction,” 146–54). Through Turbodine  the trope of author-as-fairy culminates in the fairy-as-author, which evolves  into the more natural, reality-based author of Murat’s next novel, where the  female narrator’s power of story alone regulates the behavior and discussion of  her aristocratic audience (Clermidy-Patard 338).

Murat here conflates the  characteristics and acts both of her beautiful and benevolent fairies and of her fel- low conteuses, elevating both contingencies above the male writers of fairy tales  and their base, lower-class fairies from folktales. For more on the meaning of  Murat’s preface, see Böhm (127), Hannon (185), Jones (“Poetics,” 59–61), Patard,  Seifert (“Fées,” 142–43), and E. Welch (502). 4. See Goodman and Cherbuliez. 5. In her Notice to Histoires sublimes et allégoriques, Murat acknowledges her debt to  Straparola and distinguishes her tale from d’Aulnoy’s (Robert 140–41; Tucker and  Siemens 129–30; Murat, Contes, 200). A full comparison of these two tales with  “Le Turbot” is beyond the scope of the current essay, but such analysis reveals  Murat’s focus on women’s issues. As Ruth Bottigheimer states, “Comparative stud- ies based on Straparolean precursors have the potential to illuminate the writings  of the conteuses and conteurs in ways that have not yet been explored” (“France’s  First Fairy Tales,” 26). Several critics have discussed the divergences between  Murat and Straparola in their corresponding tales, which have shown that in  Murat’s versions of the tale types, female characters are foregrounded and valo- rized, whereas cultural norms, such as forced marriage, are criticized. See Cromer  and Seifert (“Pig”). 6. This is a reference to the “old” folkloric fairies written by Charles Perrault, over  which Murat claims superiority for the conteuses and their tales. For more on the  meaning of Murat’s preface, see Böhm (127), Hannon (185), Jones (“Poetics,”  59–61), Patard, Seifert (“Fées,” 142–43), and E. Welch (502). 7. For a sociocultural and publishing history of AT 675, see Bottigheimer’s  “Luckless.” Although Bottigheimer mentions d’Aulnoy’s “Le Dauphin” in the tale’s  271 MT_28.2_02.indd   271 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="21"> MELISSA A. HOFMANN publishing history (275), she neglects to mention Murat’s “Le Turbot” here or in  her book Fairy Tales: A New History when discussing the tale type (69–71). 8. Not only does Plaisir direct the adventures of her three adopted sons, Ésprit,  Mémoire, and Entendement, after they flee from her, but she also creates the links  between the subplots of the separated heroic couples Verdelet and Blanchette and  Grandimot and Philomèle. 9. Turbodine collapses the division Jasmin finds among d’Aulnoy's female charac- ters, that of “valiant heroine” or “powerful fairy” (389). Like d’Aulnoy’s heroines,  Turbodine is “capable of acting on [her] individual destiny” and of “restoring  peace and prosperity to troubled kingdoms” (370). Turbodine is perfect and beau- tiful, another characteristic of heroines, who as women were seen as superior and  thus role models for civilizing men (Raynard 326, 349; Wolfgang 29–33); she also  possesses both masculine and feminine qualities, a further characteristic of hero- ines (Jasmin 389; Raynard 337–50). Turbodine also fits Seifert’s definition of a  “resisting heroine,” who, although unable to escape “patriarchal power relations,”  is anything but a “passive wife” at the end of the tale (“Female Empowerment”). 10. Spheres of action of the hero are “departure on a search,” “reaction to the demands  of a donor,” and “wedding”; those of the donor are “the preparation for the trans- mission of a magical agent” and “provision of the hero with a magical agent”; those  of the helper are “the spatial transference of the hero,” “liquidation of misfortune or  lack,” “rescue from pursuit,” “the solution of difficult tasks,” and “transfiguration of  the hero”; those of the villain are “villainy,” “a fight or other forms of struggle with  the hero,” and pursuit; those of the princess (sought-for person) and her father are  “the assignment of difficult tasks,” “branding,” “exposure,” “recognition,” “punish- ment of a second villain,” and “marriage” (Propp 79–80). 11. Seifert notes that without the female fairy’s intervention, the chivalrous hero’s  “quest is doomed to failure. With it, he is assured of overcoming impossible odds  to transcend the lack besetting masculinity” (Seifert, Fairy Tales, 151). Yet Seifert  does not comment on what it means for the hero to achieve this masculinity  through a woman. Although the plot device of a fairy may serve what Seifert calls  the “nostalgic utopian” longings of the nobility for a masculinity currently  unavailable to them, I wish to emphasize the fact that the means for the hero  achieving the masculine goal is orchestrated by a woman, who possesses the  agency and power the hero lacks. 12. The psychological weaknesses included “frivolity . . . pointlessness, fickleness,  malice, shamelessness, deceitfulness, blind submission to the passions, jealousy,  and excessive cruelty” (Ronzeaud 10n4; my translation). 13. Jasmin discusses the heroic qualities of Aimée and Belle-Belle (374–77). See also  Jones (“Phèdre”) for a discussion of Belle-Belle as a transvestite heroine. See  Brocklebank and Raynard (340–42, 357–59) for more on heroines and  cross-dressing. 14. “L’Île des Roches” may be a reference to the Dames des Roches, a mother and  daughter who held gatherings in Poitiers in the sixteenth century (Harth 187). 15. For more on Salic law and the conteuses’ queens, see Seifert and Stanton (33n111).  They note that, although fairy queens do exist in contes de fées, they “usually do  not rule over a specific geographical realm.” In contrast, Turbodine rules over and  conquers named (if fictional) kingdoms. 272 MT_28.2_02.indd   272 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="22"> THE FAIRY AS HERO(INE) 16. “Le commerce de ses peuples n’étant que de fleurs.” All translations from “Le  Turbot” are mine. 17. “Je me séparai du roi mon époux avec beaucoup de douleur, la sienne fut si vio- lente qu’il en pensa expirer.” 18. For “war horses” the text reads mes petits coursiers. Patard states in a note that  Murat’s usage of coursiers here is poetic, not literal, and gives the definition from  Furetière’s dictionary: “grand cheval propre pour monter un homme d’armes; un  cheval de bataille” (Murat, Contes, 321n1). I see no reason to assume a poetic use of  the word here and offer that it is a deliberate choice on Murat’s part, as Turbodine  has just returned from aiding a prince in his unspecified troubles, that is, war. 19. “Reprendre la place qui vous est due dans mon coeur et sur mon trône.” 20. “Vive le roi Turbot et la reine Turbodine!” 21. “Coquerico” (or “cocorico”) is the cry of the rooster. Modern definitions give the  figurative sense of a loud cry of victory (chanter or faire cocorico) (Le Trésor de la  Lange Française informatisé) or chauvinistic vainglory (Le dictionnaire de l’Académie  française, 9th ed.) (both accessible at http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/). Coquerico,  or its variant cocorico, does not appear in Furtière’s 1690 Dictionnaire universel, but  the figurative sense of the word coq as someone in power does, although this per- son is a bourgeois or parish ruler, not a king (518; http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/ bpt6k57951269). This sense also appears in the 1694 edition of Le dictionnaire de  l’Académie française (246; http://artfl.atilf.fr/dictionnaires/ACADEMIE/PREMIERE/ premiere.fr.html). Clermidy-Patard notes the play on words of coq with “coquette- rie” and “coquets,” which emphasizes Turbodine’s husband’s (innate?) faithless- ness and places male inconstancy at the heart of the story (219). 22. “Le monde à l’envers.” 23. “D’aller rétablir le roi son beau-père dans ses États”; “une flotte équipée de tout ce  qui était nécessaire.” 24. “Une infinité de belles actions.” 25. “Elle était la maîtresse.” 26. “De ce qu’elle avait fait”; “elle eut donné les orders nécessaries pour conserver sa  conquête.” 27. For a discussion of exile as a strategy of power of the absolutist state, see  Cherbuliez (16–21). 28. “Car elle se nommait ainsi.” 29. “L’Île des Roches” may be a reference to the Dames des Roches, a mother and  daughter who held gatherings in Poitiers in the sixteenth century (Harth 187). 30. “Qu’elle n’avait qu’à donner ses ordres, et qu’ils seraient suivis ponctuellement.” 31. “Il m’obéit toujours, et il se trouvait si bien de s’être abandonné à ma conduite  qu’il ne faisait rien que par mon ordre.” 32. Regarding kingly consent, in 1556 Henri II issued an edict that clandestine mar- riages (those by minors without parental consent) could be dissolved by the state  (whereas previously marriage was only a church concern). Louis XIV later  declared marriage to be solely the concern of the state, governed by civil law, not  sacrament, because marriage and families were the foundation of the nation-state  (De Jean, Tender Geographies, 110–12). 33. Or at least women’s reason was considered different from men’s, or was made to  be, in order to exclude them from the literary marketplace, because literature was  the “manifestation and purveyor of right reason, of certain norms of beauty, of  273 MT_28.2_02.indd   273 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="23"> MELISSA A. HOFMANN vested ethical custom and particular political authority” (Reiss 200). Gains made  for arguments of equal reasoning capacity in men and women made in the first  part of the seventeenth century were eclipsed as more women’s literary influence  increased (Reiss 202). “Male writers, such as Boileau, Perrault, and La Bruyère,  excluded women from cultural production by claiming that men and women had  qualitatively different kinds of reason, and that women’s reason limited their par- ticipation to certain types of cultural production,” such as letter writing, novels,  and salon conversation (Wolfgang 55). 34. Anguillette cannot save Hébé from heartache and death in loving Atimir; Peine  Perdue’s unnamed fairy mother cannot prevent her daughter’s destiny of unre- quited love; Ravissante’s fairy is unable to bestow the gift of constancy on her and  so sequesters Ravissante on an island. Ravissante’s love match happens despite  the fairy’s precautions because love decreed the couple’s match. See “Anguillette,”  “Peine Perdue,” and “Le Prince des Feuilles,” respectively (Murat, Contes, 85–117,  395–403, 159–77). 35. “Le destin plus fort que mon art me rendait impuissante.” 36. “Le destin a plus de part que moi à tes malheurs.” 37. “Belle princesse . . . voilà celui que le destin vous ordonne de prendre pour  époux”; “Allons, quittons ce lieu incommode pour vous render au palais qui vous  est destiné.” 38. “Cette aventure . . . me parut alors un effet de la conduite du destin, qui avait pris  cette voie pour rendre possible les impossibles assujettissements de Mandarine, et  me tirer de l’engagement de mes serments.” 39. “Je préparai ensuite toutes choses pour mettre fin à ce que j’avais si heurusement  commencé.” 40. “Venez recevoir de ma main cette aimable princesse pour votre épouse.” 41. “Le destin, secondant les desseins de Turbodine, qui songeait à unir Brillantin  avec Princillette, fit naître entre ces deux jeunes coeurs une inclination  réciproque.” 42. The text reads that this fairy power “augmentait encore mon pouvoir,” the impli- cation being that Turbodine was already powerful as a woman ruler before the  addition of her otherworldly powers (Murat, Contes, 320). 43. “À qui il arriva des choses si surprenantes qu’elles composeront quelque jour une  histoire des plus agréables.” 44. It is interesting to note that Turbodine has no children of her own and bears no  biological relationship to Princillette; yet she chooses Princillette as her fairy heir.  Hannon states that in order to avoid the essential identification of women with  the body, salonnières emphasized “women’s (innate) authorial powers while deny- ing through omission the question of maternity” (209). This seems to be Murat’s  strategy here. Hannon also argues that the conteuses “created fairy-tale heroines  who experimented with autonomy at a time when noble ideology increasingly  stressed the imperatives of lineage” (210). 45. “Il est temps que je vous fasse connaître le dénouement de toutes vos aventures.” 46. “Après s’y être enfermée avec elle.” 47. “Je les [vos peines] partageais avec vous sans le faire connaître.” 48. “Une dame d’une beauté et d’une magnificence surprenantes”; “la fée . . . c’en  était une des plus puissantes.” 274 MT_28.2_02.indd   274 10/09/14   5:33 PM </page> <page sequence="24"> THE FAIRY AS HERO(INE) 49. “On savait déjà dans tout le royaume de Caprare la surprenante histoire du prince  Fortuné et de la princesse Risette, mais afin que toutes les circonstances n’en fus- sent ignorées de personne, Turbodine la fit imprimer.” 50. “La mémoire de tout ce qui s’était passé, de manière qu’il fut un témoin irre- proachable de la sagesse de la princesse.” 51. This tactic is a similar, although much less obvious, example of the way Murat  undermines patriarchal institutions she appears to support in her tales. For exam- ple, Murat’s authorial interjections about love and marriage provide ironic distance  and dysphoric commentary in tales that otherwise have happy endings (Murat,  Contes, 40–42) and the dream marriage in “Le Turbot” is a “veritable parody” that  questions the very meaning and legality of marriage (Clermidy-Patard 124). 52. See DeJean (“(Literary) World”), Duggan (41–49), Harth (187–88), and Wolfgang  (39–49). 53. Harth notes that in the seventeenth century, “publish” meant conversation or  writing (187). DeJean (“(Literary) World”), Duggan (40–49), Goodman, Harth,  and Seifert (“Fées) all discuss the semipublic/semiprivate world of the salon. 54. For example, the abbé de Villiers criticized the lack of a moral and disparaged women  as a group for their lack of education (Seifert, “Fées,” 140; Jones, “Poetics,” 57). 55. The Académie française awarded literary prizes to Murat, Bernard, Lhéritier, and  Durand, among others (Wolfgang 45). Only the Académie Royale de la Peinture  et de la Sculpture admitted women, but only seven of them from 1663 to 1682;  by 1706 women were no longer allowed (Duggan 48). By the end of the seven- teenth century, however, twenty French women writers, including Murat, were  elected to the Academy of the Ricovrati of Padua (Wolfgang 45). 56. Patard notes that the adjectives in the title of Histoires sublimes et allégoriques  “immediately invite the reader to decode the underlying truth of the tales” (272).
