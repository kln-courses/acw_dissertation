<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LATE PREHISTORIC HUMAN ECOLOGY OF BIRCH CREEK VALLEY, NORTHEASTERN OKLAHOMA by Donald 0. Henry, Barbara H. Butler and Stephen A. Hall ABSTRACT A multi-disciplinary study of the archaeological sites in Birch Creek Valley examined the valley's paleoenvironment, prehistoric economy, and demo graphy. The study indicates that during the Plains Village Period (ca. A.D. 800-1,500) the local environ ment was stable and similar to that of the area today with the valley being occupied during the late summer through winter by dispersed groups containing from 10 to 15 people. The Late Prehistoric occupants of the valley apparently relied on a broad-spectrum foraging economy and did not engage in horticulture. INTRODUCTION During the spring and summer of 1976 the Laboratory of Archaeology, University of Tulsa undertook a multi-disciplinary investiga tion of some 18 prehistoric sites located in Birch Creek Valley, northeastern Oklahoma (Figure 1).1 The research emphasized the recovery and analysis of evidence which would assist in the development of a cultural-chronology of the investigated sites, aid in the reconstruction of the paleoenvironmental settings which were equivalent with the archaeological time frames, and provide a basis for examining the adaptive strategies of the prehistoric inhab itants of the valley. PHYSIOGRAPHY AND MODERN ENVIRONMENT Birch Creek Valley is located about 75 km northwest of Tulsa, Oklahoma within the Chataugua Hills. Birch Creek traverses the hills in a southeasternly direction and joins Bird Creek as part of the Verdigris River drainage basin. The creek has formed a narrow valley flanked by steep limestone and sandstone escarpments in which are found numerous rockshelters and small caves. Although the valley rests in a major phytogeographic province, the Cross Tim bers, which is defined by dwarf oaks (Quercus marilandica and Q. stellata) and grassland, a diversity of micro-environments occur within the valley (Blair and Hubbell, 1938: duck and Fletcher, 1943: Youngman and Hohl, 1972). Environmentally, the area displays three zones: the narrow valley floor, the flanks, and the uplands. The valley floor and flanks support elm-ash-cottonwood and oak-hickory forests respectively, while the uplands display the more arid tolerant scrub oaks and grasslands. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION As a result of previous archaeological reconnaissances (Barr, 1965; Perino, 1972) some fifteen sites had been recorded in the valley. Three additional sites were recorded during the 1976 investigation. With the exception of a single site which could not be relocated, each of the sites was revisited in order to ascertain its potential for yielding significant archaeological information. Those sites which appeared to have a possibility of containing sub-surface archaeological de 207</page><page sequence="2">o"*" "I km c=?n upland floodplain j rockshelter open site Fig. 1. Map of Birch Creek Valley showing posits were test excavated in order to ascertain their depths, areal extents, and artifactual contents. Only six of the 12 sites, which were test excavated, revealed archae ological deposits and these were restricted to caves or rockshelters. Artifacts associated with open sites did not appear to be in primary archaeological context as they were dis tributed on the surface in very low densities and were clearly being transported by slope wash. This report will focus on the six excavated sites: Painted Shelter (340S129), Birch Bend Shelter (340S132), Bird Nest Cave (340S133), Sunny Shelter (340S135), Shal low Shelter (340S136), and Spring Shelter (340S193). Although each of the sites exhibited an archaeological deposit, both Birch Bend Shelter and Spring Shelter had been considerably vandalized. A grid system composed of 1m2 units sub-divided into .5m2 quadrants was em ployed in the excavation in conjunction with excavation levels which were of 10 cm in thickness. The excavation levels either fol lowed the contour of a site's surface or followed an arbitrary horizontal plane. Con approximate site locations and environmental zones. tour levels were excavated in those sites with little or no slope to their surfaces, while arbitrary horizontal levels were excavated in sites with steeply sloping surfaces. All of the excavated fill was either dry or wet screened through 1 mm mesh in order to achieve almost total recovery of archaeological evid ence (Thomas, 1969). PAINTED SHELTER The shelter, formed by rock overhang which projects from near the top of a sandstone cliff on the northside of Birch Creek, is approximately 16 m in length and averages some 3 m in width as measured from the dripline. The dry portion of the shelter is situated some 5 m above the modern floodplain at an elevation of approximately 240 m (780 feet). Two large sandstone blocks, located in the east end of the shelter, exhibit numerous bedrock features (Figure 2). Three 1nrr test units were excavated in the area of the sandstone blocks. Two of the units reached 30 cm in depth while a third unit (T-3) was terminated at 70 cm upon encountering a layer of sandstone rubble (Figure 3). 208</page><page sequence="3">Layer A consists of a yellowish tan silty sand measuring from 5-15 cm thick. The layer thickens considerably toward the back wall of the shelter due to colluvial deposition through cracks and fissures in the cliff face. Layer B is characterized by a reddish brown clayey silt containing numerous sandstone fragments. A radiocarbon date of A.D. 500 + 80 (I-9620) was obtained for the layer from charcoal recovered from a depth of 50-60 cm. RECOVERED ARTIFACTS The artifacts recovered from the three units are solely in the form of chipped stone elements. Of the 1,178 chipped stone artifacts some 57 represent tool forms and include scraper, notch, denticulate, perforator, bi face, retouched element, and point classes (Table 1). Tool samples by level range from 4 to 18 pieces. Although the samples are clearly insufficient in size for comparing intra-assem blage variability by level, the tool densities (2.7 to 10 tools per .1m3) are remarkably high when compared to other late prehistoric assemblages from the region (Henry, 1977, 1978). While considerable variation exists between the assemblages, perhaps induced by small samples, points consistently consti tute the major tool class. LEVEL I, LAYER A (0-10 cm) contains ten tools including scraper, notch, denticulate, biface, re touched element, and point classes. The scraper consists of an end scraper with unilateral obverse retouch (Figure 4:a). The notch is formed on a broken flake and exhibits continuous retouch. The denticulate displays a series of retouched concavities opposite a continuously retouched edge of an expanding flake (Figure 4:d). The biface appears as a fragment bearing bifacial retouch and perhaps represents the remains of the proximal end of a point. Two retouched elements were recorded with both exhibiting unilateral obverse retouch on broken pieces. The points consist of 4 specimens only one of which is identifiable as to variety. The points include a nearly complete Reed variety, a small point tip, a small point base and a large point base. LEVEL II, LAYER B (10-20 cm) produced eight tools including perforator, biface, retouched element, and point classes. The perforator was fabricated on the proximal end of a broken flake at the intersection of the flake's platform and a lateral edge. The specimen has been retouched to form a concavity along the lateral edge near the intersection and to create a trihedral point at the juncture of the obverse and inverse surfaces of the flake with the platform. The biface is irregularly shaped and exhibits totally flaked surfaces on both faces. The points embrace 5 specimens including the serrated blade segment of a Sequoyah point, two small side-notched specimens, and two unidentifiable basal fragments. LEVEL III, LAYER B (20-30 cm) contains the greatest number of tool forms of the various levels and is represented by scraper, biface, retouched element, and point classes. Two scrapers were recorded which consisted of a side-scraper (Figure 4:e) formed along the lateral edge of a large flake and the broken bit of an end-scraper. The side-scraper also exhibits marginal retouch and burin blows on its distal end. Two bifaces represented by a broken piece and a large lanceolate specimen (Figure 4:c) were recovered. The lanceolate specimen bears marginal EXCAVATION \ ? PAINTED SHELTER 0 1 2 3m OS 129 Fig. 2.

Some four retouched elements were recorded which include three specimens exhibiting discontinuous obverse retouch and another specimen displaying continuous inverse retouch. Some 10 points were recognized including Washita (2), Harrell (1), and Huffaker (1), varieties. Additionally, three unidentified small point bases and a single large contracting stemmed base were recorded. LEVEL IV, LAYER B (30-40 cm) furnished six tools including biface, retouched element, and point classes. A single ovoid biface was recorded. The retouched elements consisted of a specimen displayed bilateral obverse retouch and another exhibited both obverse and inverse marginal retouch. The points included a Fresno variety (Figure 4:b) and two small point bases. LEVEL VI, LAYER B (50-60 cm) also furnished a small number of tool forms with only five specimens recorded. Biface, retouched element, and point classes were represented. The biface consisted of a large bifacially worked fragment. A single retouched element bearing obverse marginal retouch was recorded. Points encompassed two small point tips and a large contracting stemmed base. LEVEL VII, LAYER B (60-70 cm) contained four tools including a perforator, a retouched element and two points. The perforator was formed by opposed notches on a broken blade. A single retouched element was recorded which exhibited bifacial inverse retouch. Two unidentifiable point fragments were recovered consisting of a small point base and the medial sigment of a small point. The 1, 121 non-tool pieces are restricted to secondary, tertiary, and bifacial thinning elements (Table 2). No cores or primary elements were recovered from the test units. The non-tool elements display consistent configurations between the various levels, with tertiary elements constituting the major ity of the class. The absence of primary elements and cores implies that little initial processing was being undertaken at the site. During the occupation of Painted Shelter, four chert varieties (Florence, Foraker, Keo kuk, and Tahlequah) provided the raw 211</page><page sequence="6">TABLE 2: The physical attributes of the sites and their non-tool class configurations.

Florence and Foraker cherts were the most prevalently used, while Keokuk and Tahle quah (Peoria) cherts were employed less extensively (Table 3). The lithological descrip tions, geologic proveniences, and a real distributions of these cherts have been extensively discussed elsewhere (Banks, M.S., Skinner, 1957: 39-44; Neal, 1973: 22; Vaughn, 1975: 13). Although various nomen clatures have been employed to define these materials, those used by Banks in his comprehensive examination of most of the flint varieties in northeastern Oklahoma, is followed in this report.

SUMMARY The Painted Shelter was apparently oc cupied during both Plains Woodland and Plains Village periods as indicated by a radiocarbon determination and diagnostic artifacts. A date of approximately A.D. 500, for level 50-60 delimits the early phase of the occupation, while the prevalence of small triangular and side-notched points define a Plains Village occupation (ca. A.D. 900-1,600) in the upper 50 cm of the deposit. Although the Plains Village levels of the deposit are undated, a sharp rise in the pine pollen for the upper 20 cm of the deposit may provide chronologic evidence. If the increase in pine pollen from Painted Shelter is equivalent in age to a similar rise recorded in Plains Village levels at Big Hawk Shelter and Cut Finger Cave (Hall, 1977c) located a few miles to the south in Hominy Creek Valley, then the upper part of Painted Shelter would date from A.D. 900 to 1,300. BIRCH BEND SHELTER Birch Bend Shelter (340S132) is located 0 10 20 30 40cm Fig. 6. Pictograph at Painted Shelter. about 120 m south of Birch Creek near the middle of an abrupt southern meander of the channel. The shelter is positioned near the crest of a sandstone escarpment at the head of a small side tributary some 17 m above the modern floodplain and at an elevation of approximately 246 m (800 feet). The tributary originating at the shelter is active only during periods of prolonged precipitation. The Birch Bend Shelter is remarkable in size as it measures some 45 m in length, 15 m in width (from the dripline) and over 5 m in maximum height from floor to ceiling. The 15m2 excavated in Birch Bend Shelter encompasses 13m2 of contiguous units in the west end of the site and two isolated units located to the east and south of the block excavation (Figure 7). In that bedrock exposures and thin (5-15 cm) sterile sediments appeared over most of the eastern and southern portions of the site, the investigation focussed on the northwestern sector of the shelter. In this sector, the floor of the shelter exhibited a level area and some 40 cm of artifact bearing sediments. Unfortunately, vandals have seriously disturbed the area as documented by the recovery of bottle glass, bits of aluminum foil, plastic, and other recent objects. The disturbed zone, however, is for the most part confined to the upper 20 cm of the deposit and can be distinguished from in situ sediments by compaction and color. The deposit of Birch Bend Shelter exhibits two stratigraphic zones overlying a layer of sandstone. Layer A is defined by a loose grey to black sandy silt containing various objects of recent origin, while layer B is characterized by a tan to orange compact sand. RECOVERED ARTIFACTS The 613 artifacts recovered from the test 213</page><page sequence="8">n Excavation units O 1 9 ^ _ S Ell Drip,ine U_J_J 3ToSBH3D2SHELTER PBM Bedrock Bedrock mortars Fig. 7. Map of Birch Bend Shelter. excavations of Birch Bend Shelter are restricted to chipped stone elements of which 45 are tool forms. The tools embrace a limited number of classes including scrapers, drills, retouched elements, and points. Although intra-assemblage comparisons would not produce meaningful results due to the probable mixing and biasing of artifact configurations for level I and II, points clearly dominate the assemblages for all of the levels (Table 1). LEVEL I, LAYER A (0-10 cm) contains eight tools represented by a knife, retouched elements, and points. The knife displays uniform overlapping obverse retouch along the edge of an elongated flake (Figure 8:b). The retouched elements include two specimens exhibiting unilateral discontinuous obverse retouch. Points are represented by Fresno (Figure 8:d), Washita (Figure 8:c), Reed, Scallorn, and Sequoyah varieties. LEVEL II, LAYER A (10-20 cm) includes ten tools composed of scraper, drill, retouched element, and point classes. The scraper consists of the broken bit of an end scraper. The drill class includes two specimens, a basal fragment and a medial section of a bit. The retouched elements consist of three pieces bearing discontinuous unilateral, obverse retouch and element displaying marginal bifacial retouch. All of the retouched elements occur on broken flakes. The point class includes Haskell and Sequoyah varieties in addition to the tip of small point. LEVEL III, LAYER B (20-30 cm) furnished some 17 tool forms representing retouched element and point classes. Retouched elements include seven speci mens exhibiting discontinuous, unilateral obverse retouch and single element bearing marginal bifacial retouch along one edge. The retouched elements appear without exception on broken flakes. Points include Fresno and Sequoyah varieties in addition to two large point tips and three medial segments of large points. LEVEL IV, LAYER B (30-40 cm) yielded ten tools including scraper, burin, retouched element, and 214</page><page sequence="9">a b d Fig. 8. Illustrated tools from Birch Bend Shelter: (a) burin, (b) knife, (c) Washita point, and (d) Fresno point. point classes. Scrapers consist of two broken bits of end-scrapers. The single burin is in form of a multiple dihedral burin on a snap with the platform appearing on the distal end of a broken point (Figure 8:a). Retouched elements include two pieces displaying discontinuous, unilateral, obverse retouch and a single specimen which is inversely retouched. Points are represented by two small point tips, and a large point tip. The 568 non-tool elements recovered from Birch Bend Shelter principally occur in the form of tertiary elements (Table 2). A limited number of secondary and bifacial thinning elements were retrieved and only a single core was recorded. Apparently, very little initial processing was being undertaken at the site as indicated by the paucity of cores, primary and secondary elements. An examination of Table 3 reveals that Florence and Keokuk cherts were more extensively utilized than the other chert varieties for tool fabrication. Although each of the chert varieties display attributes characteristic of annealling those elements made of Florence chert consistently exhibit a higher frequency of heat-treatment. Addi tionally, the presence of considerable num bers of secondary elements, which evidence attributes of heat-treatment, implies that the technique of annealling was undertaken prior to final tool fabrication. SUMMARY Although radiometric determinations were not obtained from the Birch Bend Shelter, the numerous small triangular and side notched points recovered from the upper 30 cm of the deposit indicate a Plains Village occupation of the site. BIRD NEST CAVE Bird Nest Cave (340S133) is located on the west bank of Birch Creek approximately 75 m from the modern channel. The cave has been formed by the erosion of a fissure at the base of the sandstone escarpment. The chamber, measuring approximately 6 m in length and about 2 m in width, tapers significantly from front to back. The excavation encompassed 3.75 m2 represented by 3 m2 of continguous units located near the back of the cave and three .25 m2 units positioned near the entrance. Additionally, several auger holes were drilled outside the dripline near the mouth of the cave. A single stratigraphic layer was revealed by the excavation. The layer consists of a grayish tan silty sand which becomes more compact with depth. Sandstone blocks and spalls, which have fallen from the ceiling of the cave, are interspersed within the layer. RECOVERED ARTIFACTS Prehistoric artifacts, restricted to chipped and ground stone elements, were recovered to a depth of 40 cm inside the dripline of the cave. The auger samples failed to reveal evidence of an occupation outside the cave. Modern objects (including a leather belt, wooden stake, plastic, glass and crockery fragments) were found in conjunction with 215</page><page sequence="10">^^^^^^^-'s 1 ^^^^^^^^^ a b ' ^ " Fig. 9. Illustrated tools from Bird Nest Cave: (a) retouched piece, (b) side-scraper, and (c) side-scrap er, and (c) side-scraper. the prehistoric artifacts in the upper 20 cm of the deposit. The chipped stone assemblage includes 35 elements of which only six are tool forms. The tools consists of scraper, retouched element, and point classes (Table 1). The scrapers are represented by a bilateral side scraper with continuously retouched margins (Figure 9:b) and a side-scraper opposite a retouched edge (Figure 9:c). The retouched element exhibits a point formed by bilateral marginal retouch on both faces of a relatively thick (9 mm) flake (Figure 9:b). Points consist of two specimens represented by a Washita variety and a medial segment of a small point. With exception to a single bifacial thinning flake, the non-tool assemblage is composed entirely of tertiary elements (Table 2). A single ground stone artifact was identified in level IV. The specimen reveals some five small depressions (approximately 3 cm diameter by 1.5 cm in depth) on a roughly square slab of sandstone (measuring about 20 cm on a side). SUMMARY Based on the recovery of a single diagnostic artifact, the Washita point, it would appear that the prehistoric occupation of Bird Nest Cave relates to the Plains Village Period. SUNNY SHELTER The site (340S135) is located approxi mately 250 m north of Birch Creek at the base of a low sandstone escarpment. The projec tion of the cliff furnishes a limited area of shelter measuring approximately 8 m in length and somewhat over 2 m in width behind the dripline. A trench, composed of two 1 m2 units, was excavated at the juncture of the shelter's floor and the talus slope in order to obtain stratigraphic information and to ascertain the artifactual content of the site (Figure 10). Aside from a weakly developed modern soil, a single stratigraphic layer was en countered overlying bedrock in the 140 cm of deposit. The sediment of a layer is a dark gray sandy silt containing a high density of charcoal fines and other organics. Two radiocarbon dates were obtained from the deposit at: level 40-50 cm, A.D. 1,030 ? (1-9621) and level 90-100 cm, A.D. 500 ? 80 (I-9622). RECOVERED ARTIFACTS The cultural artifacts recovered in the excavation were restricted to chipped stone and ground stone elements. Of the 439 chipped stone elements 38 occurred as tool forms. The 38 chipped stone tools recorded at Sunny Shelter are limited to five classes: scraper, biface, denticulate, retouched ele ment, and point. Although the small number of specimens recovered from each level clearly prohibits meaningful intra-assemblage comparisons, an examination of Table 1 reveals that retouched elements and points dominate each of the assemblages, regardless of level. Additionally, it would appear that a zone of high tool density is presented between levels IV and VIII. LEVEL I (0-10 cm) yielded only two specimens: a flake bearing a marginal bifacial retouch along a convex edge and a point similar to a Reed variety. LEVEL II (10-20 cm) no tools were recovered. LEVEL III (20-30 cm) no tools were recovered. LEVEL IV (30-40 cm) provided nine tools including retouched element and point classes. Two retouched elements displaying discontinuous inverse retouch 216</page><page sequence="11">were recorded. The points consisted of both Washita (Figure 11:b) and Reed varieties in addition to several unidentifiable small point bases, medial segments and tips. LEVEL V (40-50 cm) furnished six tools repre senting retouched elements and points. The re touched elements encompassed two specimens displaying discontinuous obverse retouch on broken flakes and a third piece exhibiting discontinuous inverse retouch. The points consisted of a single Washita variety (Figure 11 :c), a small point base and a small point tip. LEVEL VI (50-60 cm) provided six tools of retouched element and point classes. Retouched elements consisted of a broken flake with discon tinuous obverse retouch and an inversely retouched flake. The points were represented by unidentifiable small point bases, medial segments, and tips. LEVEL VII (60-70 cm) contained only two tools: a broken flake displaying discontinuous obverse re touch and a Washita point. LEVEL VIII (70-80 cm) yielded six tools which envinced the greatest ingra-assemblage variation of any of the excavation levels. Biface, denticulate, retouched element, and point classes are represented. The biface exhibits an oviod form and fine bifacial retouch. The denticulate appears unilaterally on the obverse surface of a flake. The retouched elements include discontinuously and obverse retouched spe cimens. Points consist of a Washita variety and a small point tip. LEVEL IX (80-90 cm) furnished only two tools, consisting of a retouched element bearing discon tinuous, unilateral obverse retouch and a large point exhibiting an expanding base. LEVEL X (90-100 cm) contained a single specimen: a retouched element displaying discontinuous uni lateral obverse retouch. LEVEL XI (100-110 cm) contributed four tools including scraper, retouched element, and point classes. The scraper is in the form of a side-scraper bearing inverse retouch (Figure 11:a). A single retouched element exhibiting discontinuous unilateral obverse retouch was recorded. Points consisted of a small point base and a large expanding base. While the number of non-tool elements fluctuates considerably from level to level, tertiary elements consistently dominate the assemblage with secondary and bifacial thinning elements occurring in markedly smaller frequencies (Table 2). The paucity of secondary elements and absence of cores and primary elements denote that little, if any, initial processing occurred at the site. An examination of Table 3 reveals that Florence chert was most frequently used for tool fabrication, while Foraker, Keokuk, and Tahlequah cherts were employed less often. Although the absence of secondary elements which exhibit characteristics of heat-treat ment suggest that the technique was applied after initial processing, the limited sample size detracts from the proposition.

SUMMARY The two radiocarbon determinations in conjunction with temporally diagnostic arti facts (i.e. Washita points) indicate that Sunny Shelter was inhabited during much of the Plains Village Period, beginning as early as A.D. 700. SHALLOW SHELTER AND CAVE Shallow Shelter and Cave (340S136) are located near the crest of a sandstone escarp ment approximately 125 m west of Fourmile Creek. The shelter and cave are situated along a narrow ledge about 8 m apart (Figure 12). The ledge rests some 15 m above the modern floodplain at an elevation of 254 m (825 feet) and trends south to north. The shelter, formed by slight rock over hang, measures about 10 m in length and 1.5 to 2 m in width behind the dripline. A large sandstone block defines the southern bound ary of the site, while a low wall of unmodified sandstone demarks the northern boundary of the shelter. Further north along the ledge a small cave, some 4 m deep and 3 m wide, appears in the cliff face. Eleven 1 m2 units were excavated in the area of the shelter and three 1 m2 units were excavated in the cave (Figure 12). In the excavation of Shallow Shelter, two stratigraphic layers were encountered: Layer A, a dark silt which was 10-15 cm thick; and Layer B a yellowish tan sand interspersed with sandstone rocks (Figure 13). Artifacts were recovered from both strata; however, considerably greater artifacts densities were recorded in Layer A. Within the cave a single stratigraphic layer was encountered in the units excavated to 30 cm in depth. The layer was characterized by a light brown sand interspersed with sandstone fragments.

Stratigraphy of Shallow Shelter. the shelter was restricted to chipped and ground stone specimens. Some 780 chipped stone elements were recovered and 16 of these represented tool forms. The tools embraced scraper, perforator, biface, re touched element, and point classes (Table 1). Over one-half of the assemblage was retrieved from level I in the first 10 cm of the deposit. LEVEL I, LAYER A included nine specimens from five tool classes. A single end-scraper bearing bilateral retouch on an elongated flake was recorded (Figure 14:a). A perforator formed at the junction of steeply retouched edges was identified on a broken flake. Two broken bifaces, perhaps representing basal fragments of large contracting stem points were also recorded. Additionally, a retouched element bearing obverse unilateral retouch was denoted. Points consisted of non-diagnostic fragments of small specimens. LEVEL II, LAYER B provided only five specimens consisting of scrapers, retouched elements, and points. Scrapers include a nosed endscraper appear ing on the obverse surface of a broken, expanding flake. Retouched elements consist of a specimen displaying unilateral discontinuous obverse retouch and another element bearing unilateral discontinuous inverse retouch. A single non-diagnostic small point tip was noted. LEVEL III, LAYER B furnished only two tools: an end-scraper on a large flake (Figure 14:d) and a non-diagnostic small point tip. The non-tool elements from Shallow Shelter exhibit very little variability in class configurations by level, as tertiary elements dominate each of the levels (Table 2). The absence of cores and paucity of primary and secondary elements indicate that little initial processing was undertaken at the site, while the moderate frequencies of bifacial thinning elements denote an emphasis on final tool fabrication. Three ground stone artifacts made of sandstone were recovered from the excava tion including: (1) a broken ovoid handstone bearing polish on both faces. The specimen, measuring some 6 cm in width and 2.5 cm in thickness, was recovered from level II. (2) a rectangular handstone displaying bifacial polish. The specimen, measuring 8 cm in length, 6 cm in width, and 3 cm thick, was recovered from level III. (3) a rectangular specimen ground on one surface measuring 28 cm in length, 13 cm in width, and 5 cm thick was recovered from level III. c' d Fig. 14.

Photograph of wall at Shallow Shelter looking south. The test units in the cave produced only chipped stone artifacts. A single tool was recorded in the assemblage which consisted of 30 specimens. The tool was in the form of a large contracting stemmed projectile point (Figure 14:c). The non-tool specimens were dominated by tertiary elements (25) with lesser numbers of bifacial thinning elements (4). The upper 10 cm of the cave's deposit failed to yield artifacts as those sediments containing cultural material appeared be tween 10 and 30 cm in depth. Twenty arti facts were retrieved from level II (10-20 cm) and ten specimens were noted in level II (20-30 cm). An examination of Table 3 revealed that Florence Chert was utilized in the shelter and cave occupations to a considerably greater extent than the other chert varieties. It is noteworthy that Foraker Chert appears to have been infrequently used given that it occurs in closer proximity to the site than any of the other varieties. The presence of high percentages of secondary elements evincing characteristics of heat-treatment indicates that the technique was employed during the initial stages of stone tool processing. FEATURE In the northern end of the shelter, a wall consisting of from four to five courses of unhewn sandstone was identified (Figure 15). The wall, approximately 60 cm high and 100 cm in length, rests against the back wall of the shelter and appears to have spanned the width of the ledge in the past. A number of rocks, documenting the collapse of several courses, appear to the south of the wall. The excavation of the area adjacent to the wall exposed the first course of stones at approximately 20 cm under the modern surface. Although no artifacts were recovered from the excavation north of the wall, chipped stone artifacts were recovered im mediately subsurface south of the wall. The recovery of artifacts at depths equivalent with the first and second courses of wall stones clearly implies that the wall was constructed during the prehistoric occupa tion of the site. At its original height, the wall 220</page><page sequence="15">would have effectively enclosed the northern end of the shelter and considerably improved the site for winter habitation. SUMMARY Although no diagnostic artifacts were recovered from Shallow Shelter numerous small point tips and bases suggest a Plains Village affiliation. SPRING SHELTER The site (340S193) is located at the base of a sandstone escarpment on the north side of Birch Creek approximately 350 m from the modern channel. The floor of the Shelter rests approximately 6 m above the present flood plain at an elevation of 231 m (850 feet). The shelter is formed by a 3-5 m projec tion near the top of the cliff along some 15 m of its face. Some 75 m west of the shelter a spring emerges from the base of the escarp ment creating a marsh to the west and south of the site. Three 1 m2 units were excavated in the floor of the shelter behind the drip line in order to obtain information of the site's stratigraphy and artifactual content. Excava tion was terminated at a depth of 40 cm upon encountering a compact gray clay which was void of cultural material. The floor of the shelter displayed from 5-15 cm of very compact clayey silt extending from the surface. This veneer had resulted from cattle congregating on the site and compressing the surface sediments. Beneath the compact layer a strata of silts exhibit ing considerable horizontal variation in color, compaction, and texture was exposed. The variation in the sediments reflected the disturbance which had been wrought by intermittent vandalization of the site over the last two decades. The recovery of recent glass and metal objects deep within the shelter's talus confirmed the landowners account of informed and organized looting of the site. The excavation principally yielded chipped stone elements although pottery and ground stone artifacts were also recovered. In that vertical distributions are somewhat meaning less because of the severe disturbance of the deposit, the artifactual assemblage were treated as a single unit. Of the some 1,070 chipped stone artifacts only 17 were tool forms. Unfortunately, the integrity of the tool to non-tool ratio is suspect due to the intensive looting of the site. The 17 tools embrace scraper, perforator, re touched element, and point classes (Table 1). The scrapers include two end-scrapers bearing rounded bits without lateral retouch (Figure 16:a). The perforator is represented by a single flake exhibiting adjacent retouched concavities which create a point. A single retouched element having unilateral discontinuous obverse retouch was re corded. The point class consisted of Fresno, Sequoyah (Figure 16:c), Harrell, and Scallorn (Figure 16:b), varieties in addition to several non-diagnostic small point fragments. A single large point tip was recovered. The 1,053 non-tool specimens were domi nated by tertiary elements with lesser num bers of primary secondary, and bifacial thinning elements appearing in the assem blage (Table 2). While the low frequencies of primary and secondary elements suggest a limited amount of initial processing, the high percentage of tertiary elements clearly docu ment the emphasis which was placed on the fabrication of chipped stone tools. The two pottery sherds recovered from the test units were both shell tempered with gray to black exterior and interior surfaces. Similar ware has been identified as Woodward Plain (Freeman and Buck, 1960). Ground stone artifacts consist of: (1) a triangular piece of sandstone (approximately 10 cm on each side and 4.5 cm thick) which exhibits a round depression (2 cm in diameter and 5 cm deep) near the center of the stone; and (2) an oval sandstone specimen (roughly 16 cm by 13 cm) which bears a series of ^^B^*- 0 \ 2 cm. ^^^^ a b c Fig. 16.

SUMMARY In that the deposit of Spring Shelter has been severely disturbed little intrasite informa tion could be obtained from the investiga tion. The recovery of several artifacts (i.e. small triangular and side-notched points and Woodward Plain pottery) which are general cultural-chronological indicators suggest a Plains Village Period occupation of the site. so o h 5 0 // // - PAINTED SHELTER, I-IV (n48) /' 4 0- i ? -D BIRCH BEND SHELTER (n 45) o L &lt; ft f\ Jo o-o SUNNY SHELTER (n38) \ L " 30- / \ //' &lt; J \ //' o ;/ \ /'/ 2 '/ ? ^ /" ' / \ \\ /' ?

Frequency polygons of the tool assemblages from Painted Shelter, Birch Bend Shelter, and Sunny Shelter. 222</page><page sequence="17">INTER-SITE COMPARISONS The prehistoric sites which have been recorded in Birch Creek Valley were for the most part occupied during the Plains Village Period (ca. A.D. 800-1,500). Only the site of Painted Shelter contained evidence for an earlier period of occupation. In that relatively small lithic tool assem blages were recovered from the excavated sites, inter-site typological comparisons are restricted to only three sites. The frequency polygons which were developed for the tool classes of the Painted Shelter, Birch Bend Shelter, and Sunny Shelter assemblages show an overall similarity of tool-kits (Figure 17). Scrapers, retouched elements, and points consistently appear in high frequencies in the three assemblages, while the other tool classes occur in lower frequencies with con siderable variability. Unfortunately, the small samples prohibit the use of more rigorous and less subjective statistical techniques (e.g. chi-square) for defining the relationships between the three tool-kits. Non-tool ele ments were recovered in large enough numbers to allow for comparisons to be made between five of the excavated sites (Table 2). The five assemblages evince similar patterns as they are dominated by tertiary elements with bifacial thinning, secondary, and primary elements in conjunction with a near absence of cores suggest that little initial processing and blank production was under taken at the sites. On the other hand, the high freqencies of tertiary elements and the |jF FLORENCE I ^ ^ J^ORAKER V SHLEWA^ V_ BIRCH CREEr^ } ) ( Cs\ \ \^ KEOKUK f 040km lL Fig. 18. Map showing the distributions of the major chert resources in Northwestern Oklahoma. consistent appearance of bifacial thinning elements imply that the final fabrication and rejuvenation of chipped stone tools was a recurrent activity which was undertaken during the occupations of the shelters. An examination of the artifact densities of the shelters furnishes a means for evaluating the intensities of their prehistoric utilizations. The artifact density of a site is computed by dividing the total number of chipped stone elements by the volume of excavated fill. The artifact density is presented as the average number of chipped stone elements for .1m3. The intensity of utilization is viewed as a product of several factors which include the number of occupants that habitually utilized a site, the frequency in which the site was occupied, and the duration of the occupa tions. The direct relationship between artifact densities and intensities of occupations, however, may be obscured by both cultural and natural factors. For example, sites which are near raw material sources may yield artifact densities which are significantly greater than sites which have had equivalent intensities of utilization yet are more distant from the raw material. Additionally, unequal site areas (Wobst, 1974) and differential rates of deposition (Ziegler, 1973) may act to distort the relationship between artifact density and the intensity in which a site was utilized. The differential availability of new material does not appear to have been a factor which could have influenced the artifact densities of the Birch Creek Valley sites. The valley does not contain a raw material source and chert varieties identified in the lithic assemblages were secured from considerable distances to the northwest and east of the valley (Figure 18). In order to examine the relationship between the artifact densities of the shelters and their areas and rates of deposition, scattergrams of the data points were devel oped and least squares regression lines were computed (Figure 19). Given the roughly equivalent ages of the cultural horizons, the thicknesses of the cultural deposits are viewed as relative measures of the shelters' rates of deposition. Neither the site areas nor the thicknesses of the cultural deposits have strong linear relationships to artifact densities as indicated by the scattergrams and by negative correlation coefficients of -.481 and 223</page><page sequence="18">-.285, respectively. The scattergrams how ever, reveal an interesting pattern in that the site (340S132) with the largest area and the site (340S135) with the thickest cultural deposit display the two lowest artifact densities. The inverse relationship between artifact densities and thicknesses of cultural deposits is to be expected. The failure of the remaining sites to strongly reflect this relationship may be accounted for by their similarities in areas and thicknesses as reflected in their nearly vertical distributions in the scattergrams. An obvious factor which would have influenced the intensity in which a site was utilized would have been the site's proximity to a water source. In order to examine this relationship a scattergram was developed which compares the artifact densities of the sites to their distances from permanent water (Figure 20). The "distance" figures were computed on the basis of horizontal multiplied by vertical distance to permanent water as was determined on 7.5 minute U.S.G.S. Quadrangle Maps. The scattergram clearly indicates a strong negative linear relationship between artifact density and distance to water as confirmed by a correlation coef ficient of -.756. An examination of the scatter gram reveals that site 340S132 is the most distant point from the regression line and given its distance to water (ca. 1,000 m) is greatly under represented in respect to its projected artifact density (ca. 75). The lower than expected artifact density of 340S132 may be explained by the shelter's excep tionally large area and northern exposure. As previously discussed the shelter's large floor area would have allowed the prehistoric occupants to distribute their activities over a much larger area than in the other shelters and thereby would have reduced the artifact density of the site. Site 340S132 is also the only shelter with a northern exposure and would have been limited to warm season encampments while the other shelters, which face south and southeast, had the potential for occupations during all seasons.

When site 340S132 is not included, the remaining sites show an even stronger linear relationship between artifact density and distance to water and a correlation coefficient of -.972. Although the inverse relationship between artifact densities and distances to water is not particularly surprising, the impact that minor distances have on artifact density is of importance. The predictive value in defining the relationship is also importance in examin ing settlement patterns as will be discussed later. FAUNAL ANALYSES In situ faunal elements were recovered from all sites, but only four sites, Painted Shelter, Birch Bend Shelter, Bird Nest Cave, and Sunny Shelter, (340S129, 340S132, 340S133, and 340S135) yielded adequate samples (Table 4). The total number of faunal elements recovered from each site varied as a result of differences in cubic areas tested and differential faunal densities (Table 4). Although fragmented, the bone was well preserved. The large number of fragments recovered results in part, from the small mesh used during the screening process. The extremely high density from Painted Shelter results only in part from the recovery of very small pieces; even if a larger mesh had been used, the densities would have been high in that the bulk of the sample is made up of moderately sized long bone fragments re presenting large and medium-size species. Burned elements include those which are charred black in part or whole, as well as those which exhibit the white/blue coloration indicating a hot, prolonged fire. For this study, no distinction was made between the various decrees of burning. In addition to the following generalized description of faunal materials for each site, other data are summarized in Table 4 and 5. PAINTED SHELTER (340S129) Although a relatively large number of faunal elements was recovered from this rockshelter, an extremely small percentage were identifiable (Table 4). Of the six sites this one exhibits the highest density of elements. 1 40' 193 1 20' \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ^E 1 00' \ ^ ^ \ \ &amp; \ 129 5 \ \ t \ \ 5 \ \ o 60' \ \ t \\ 40- \ \ \ \ \ \ 135 \ \ 132 \\ 20- \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ J-,-,-,-, 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 HORIZONTAL x VERTICAL DISTANCE TO WATER (m) Fig. 20. Scattergram and regression line for artifact densities of the sites plotted against their distance to water. The small size of the fragments is probably a result of cultural practices rather than natural forces or excavation procedures; the breaks are old. The fragmentation could have resulted from food preparation procedures, grease extraction, or as a secondary effect of refuse disposal and disturbance during site occupation. Almost one-half of the unidenti fiable sample had been burned; however, relatively few of the identifiable elements had been burned. Deer, cottontail rabbit, and box turtle are the most commonly represented species. The turtle remains consist of carapace and plastron fragments from averaged-sized (ca. 13 cm) adult individuals. Turtle elements are relatively more frequent in the Plains Wood land levels than the Plains Village levels. A minimum of three deer is represented: two in 225</page><page sequence="20">the Plains Village Period (one fused and one unfused calcaneum) and one in the Plains Woodland Period. Only one cottontail ele ment was recovered from the earlier period in contrast to the thirty-one recovered from the later period. Fish remains were scarce here; those few recovered came from the Plains Village levels. BIRCH BEND (340S132) The density of elements from Birch Bend Shelter is similar to those of Bird Nest Cave and Sunny Shelter (Table 4). More elements were identifiable from this shelter than any of the others; a relatively large inventory of species was identified as well (Table 5). Approximately one third of the unidentifiable sample was burned as were 61 (12%) of the identifiable sample. Deer, cottontail, turtle, and short nose gar stand out as important faunal resources. A variety of fish vertebrae were recovered and, TABLE 4: Inventory of Species for all Sites SITE 340S129 340S132 340S133 340S135 340S136 340S193 SPECIES l-VVI-VII Short-tailed Shrew Blarnia brevicauda 2 Eastern Mole Scalopus aquaticus 3 Cottontail Rabbit Sylvilagus flohdana 31 1 99 33 82 1 2 13-Lined Ground Spermophilus tri- 16 Sq. decern Ii meatus 1 Squirrel Sciurus sp. 1 17 7 Plains Pocket Geomys bursarius 4 5 1 Gopher Beaver Castor canadensis 3 1 Harvest Mouse Reithrodontomys 1 1 fluvenscens Deer Mouse Peromyscus cf. 3 1 17 maniculatus Woodrat Neotoma floridana 16 1 Prairie or Pine Vole Microtus sp. 2 1 Dog Canis sp. 5 6 Raccoon Procyon lotor 4 13 1 9 Striped Skunk Mephitus mephitus 3 White-tailed Deer Odocoileus virginianus 25 12 36 15 109 6 Bison? cf.

Density 419.3 401.4 96.1 88.4 153.8 2.5 22.4 per Cu meter although they are not identifiable to species, it is clear that a number of different species are present. Six rabbits are represented; one is immature since unfused elements were recovered. Three individual deer were count ed; one adult, one immature, and one very young fawn (propably less than 5 months old). These few remains cannot definitely substantiate the seasonal occupation of the shelter, however, the relatively high fre quency of turtle, and the presence of gar both suggest at least a summer occuation. Turtle generally hibernate during the winter and gar are more difficult to catch during the cold months. The fawn, as well, suggests a late summer or early fall occupation. BIRD NEST CAVE (340S133) The total sample from the cave is small; only ten percent was identifiable. The density of elements, however, is similar to other sites with larger samples. The sample comes from a relatively small area (approximately one cubic meter). In addition to the anticipated high num bers of rabbit and deer, deer mouse elements were also recovered. These came from the upper 10 cm of the excavation and probably represent intrusive individuals. At least two white-tail deer are represented because both fused and unfused second phalages were recovered. A large number of the unidenti fiable elements were burned; relatively few of the identifiable pieces were. 227</page><page sequence="22">SUNNY SHELTER (340S135) The density of bone is the second highest of the six sites, but is similar to Birch Bend Shelter and Bird Nest Cave. Seventeen species were identified and this is the only site which has either bison-sized or human elements. Three large pieces are only provisionally identified as bison; one is a 5 cm section of a rib, another is a long bone section with no distinguishing markings, and one third is a fragmentary patella. Rodent gnawed human fragments (clavicle, ulna, and humerus) were recovered from two units at the 90-100 cm and 120-130 cm levels. The pieces are most likely from the same adult individual. The deer elements represent a minimum of three individuals; the size dimorphism of the fragments suggests a male and female, and one proximal unfused tibia suggests a sub-adult. The largest number of fish pieces were recovered from this site (53 pieces). Over one half of the specimens were gar elements and all except six were scales thus, minimum number of gar could not be determined. One tubular, medium-sized bone frag ment, ca. 4 cm long, has the "ring and snap" cut marks on one end. And another tip was also recovered but it is too badly damaged by rodent gnawing to show use marks. SHALLOW SHELTER (347S136) Faunal elements were recovered only from the cave area. The low density of material stands in marked contrast to all the other sites. Even the frequency of burned elements in the unidentified sample is much lower than any of the other sites. Although the bone recovered consists of small fragments, the pieces are well pre served. The three species identified on the basis of a single bone each are common to all the other sites. SPRING SHELTER (340S193) A high percentage (27%) of this site's small sample (202) was identified; this is due largely to a cluster of Terrapene shells which came from the upper 10 cm level. Most of the unidentifiable fragments are very small and a little over one-third of the same is burned. The species identified are same as those identified from other shelters, however turtle elements were much more frequent than was observed in the other samples. Since a minimum number of two turtles was counted (based on the presence of nuchal bones) it is possible that these remains represent many carapace/plastron fragments from the same turtles rather than a real increase in the importance of turtle. DISCUSSION Although the sample sizes vary, some generalization derived from these data can be offered. Birch Bend and Sunny Shelter have several similar characteristics and can be distinguished from Painted Shelter and Bird Nest Cave. Although the sample from Spring Shelter is small, it does seem to be more similar to the first group than to the latter. The sample from Shallow Cave is too small to consider. The higher frequencies of turtle and fish elements in Birch Bend and Sunny Shelter indicate that these sites were inhabited during the summer or warmer months. The charac teristics of the two pairs of shelters are summarized and contrasted in Table 6. The most important food resources identi fied from the samples are cottontail rabbit, white-tailed deer, shortnose gar, and box turtle. This is a minimal representation of the species available in the area then, which is not markedly different from the environment of today. Small samples are undoubtedly an important factor in this regard. No butchering marks were observed on any of the identifiable elements. Only a few were observed on unidentified, deer-sized fragments. Many had been gnawed by rodents, thus obliterating or, at least, com promising any interpretation of suspected cut marks. No bone tools were recovered; only one worked bone was observed (Sunny Shelter). It shows the ''ring and snap" cut marks produced while preparing sections of a tubular bone. One antler tyne section was recovered; it may have been used but because of rodent marks, conclusions are not positive. The conclusions presented here should be appreciated in light of the limitations resulting from small samples. They do, however, suggest trends which can be tested as more samples are excavated and analysed from these northern Oklahoma river system sites. 228</page><page sequence="23">PALYNOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION In 1976 a series of pollen samples was collected from archaeologic sites and asso ciated sediments at three University of Tulsa salvage archaeology projects in northern Oklahoma. The Birch Creek pollen analytical study was the first to be reported (Hall, 1977a) followed closely by the preliminary results from the Copan Reservoir (Hall, 1977b) and the Skiatook Reservoir (Hall, 1977c). The Painted Shelter pollen diagram from Birch Creek Valley, discussed below, is the first pollen analytical study of a late prehistoric site from Oklahoma since the publication of a short diagram from the eastern part of the state by Paul B. Sears in 1935. The only other published palynologic information from Oklahoma archaeologic sites is the report on the Domebo Paleolndian locality (Wilson, 1966) and, more recently, a note on the pollen, nonpollen organic micro fossils, and reworked Paleozoic spores from a Caddoan site (Wilson, 1977). A review of pollen studies of archaeologic sites (Sanders and Wyckoff, 1976) cites three additional investigations in Oklahoma, all unpublished (Johns, 1969; Sanders and Robinson, n.d.; Schoenwetter, 1975). The few pollen studies of non-archaeologic Quaternary sites in Oklahoma provide little paleoecologic in formation (Bond, 1965a, 1965b; Wilson, 1965). An unpublished investigation by Bond (1967) of cores from alluvial deposits shows important but undated vegetation changes through time. LABORATORY TREATMENT Prior to chemical processing, each sedi ment sample from Painted Shelter was oven-dried at 50?C and weighed to the nearest 0.1 gram. A spike of four Lycopodium spore tablets, each tablet containing 12,500 ? 500 spores, was added to each sample before the initial hydrochloric ac2d wash. All the samples were processed with the same sequence of chemical treatments: hydro chloric acid, potassium hydroxide, hydro chloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, acetolysis solution, sodium hypochlorite, and safranin O stain. The Lycopodium spores and fossil pollen grains were counted at the same time. The ratio of the Lycopodium counts and fossil pollen counts to the known number of Lycopodium spores introduced to the sample allows the calculation of the total number of fossil pollen grains in the sample. The total number of fossil grains divided by the dry weight of the sample results in the number of fossils pollen grains per gram of dry sediment processed; this value is called the pollen concentration. The pollen concentration of each sample from Painted Shelter is shown in the right panel of the diagram (Figure 21). Concentration data can be applied as a general index to pollen preservation and paleoecologic reliability of pollen assem blages. POLLEN PRESERVATION The decrease in pollen concentration and the increase in indeterminable (poorly pre served) grain frequencies at greater depth in the Painted Shelter deposit suggest that the pollen assemblages in the lower part of the rockshelter are altered by pollen deteriora tion. The change in pollen content is parti cularly noticeable in the upper 35 cm below which pollen concentrations and indetermin able pollen frequencies are comparatively stable. The varying pollen concentrations could be attributed to changing rates of rock shelter sedimentation: a greater rate of sediment accumulation in the lower part of the shelter would account for lower pollen concentrations. However, a similar pollen study at nearby Big Hawk Shelter (Hall, 1977c), where rates of sedimentation are nearly constant, also shows that indetermin able pollen frequencies increase while pollen concentration decreases with depth, as at Painted Shelter. The decrease in pollen concentration probably reflects an actual loss of pollen grains in the rockshelter sediment, particularly in the lower half, due to pollen destruction by microbes or oxidation. Regard less, the fairly stable profiles of oak (Quercus), hickory (Carya), grass (Gramineae), and Ambrosia, Aster, and Chenopodium types suggest that pollen destruction has not progressed sufficiently to result in differential preservation of some pollen types in favor of others. The relative frequency pollen diagram from Painted Shelter therefore reflects the past vegetation reasonably well. 229</page><page sequence="24">Painted Shelter Osage County, Oklahoma c *&gt; * i it ~ ? mmm i'll i r *" ry" ______E V ft ?\ ? ______F I A / ? _____________lZj I / 274 | 1 | / 343 ? / mm.

West of the Cross Timbers is the tall grass prairie and east is a tall grass prairie with scattered stands of trees, mainly post oak and blackjack oak. Farther east beginning about 100 km from Birch Creek Valley is the oak-hickory forest of the western Ozarks (Rice and Penfound, 1959). The pollen diagram from Painted Shelter shows that principally oak with minor amounts of grass and composites (Ambrosia and Aster types) have dominated the pollen influx throughout the 70 cm sediment column of the rockshelter. The oak-dominated spect ra are similar to the pollen spectra from surface samples from hilltops and hillslopes at Birch Creek Valley today (Hall, unpublished data). The rockshelter pollen succession indicates an oak forest vegetation, similar to the present post oak-blackjack oak Cross Timbers, was present at least 1,500 years ago. The upper part of the rockshelter deposit appears to have been eroded and may date no later than 500 years before present and possibly as early as 1,000 years before present based on the chronology of the pine rise observed in Southern Plains pollen diagrams, occurring at about the 25 cm horizon at Painted Shelter. Minor changes in pollen frequencies from the rockshelter, such as the late appearance of elm (Ulmus) and juniper (Juniperus), may suggest small shifts in the forest community through time. Conclusions regarding these minor fluctuations in the Painted Shelter pollen record should await additional evidence on whether these shifts are widespread, are local, or are artifacts of pollen grain deteriora tion in the lower spectra. One consistent change in the pollen diagram is the increase in the pine (Pinus) frequencies in the upper 25 cm of the rock shelter deposit. A similar increase in pine pollen abundance occurs in the upper part of the pollen diagrams from Big Hawk Shelter (340S114) and Cut Finger Cave (340S138) south of Birch Creek Valley along Hominy Creek west of Skiatook, Osage County (Hall, 1977c). The rise in pine pollen frequencies at the Hominy Creek sites is radiocarbon dated between about 900 and 1300 A.D.; a more precise time for the pine rise is not at present determined. A slight increase in pine pollen influx radiocarbon dated about 1400 A.D. is documented also from southwestern Kansas (Shumard, 1974). A second late Holocene pollen sequence from southwestern Kansas does not show increased pine (Kapp, 1962). However, the pine frequencies are compara tively high throughout the undated sequence (6 to 38 percent) and may represent sediment deposited after the pine rise observed in other records. Two pollen diagrams, neither dated, from meander lakes along the Red River in southeastern Oklahoma and adjacent Arkansas show a strong increase in pollen frequencies in the upper part of the pine profiles (Bond, 1967). The Red River sites probably show increased abundance of short leaf pine (P. echinata) or loblolly pine (P. taeda), or both, in the Ouachita Mountains of southeastern Oklahoma and southwestern Arkansas. Pollen studies from the Ozark region that could indicate if pines had increased in abundance during the past 1,000 years have not been made although sedi ments dating from the past 2,000 years have been reported from southwestern Missouri (Haynes, 1976). Alternatively, the late pre historic pine rise seen in Southern Plains sites could reflect the large increase in pinyon pine (P. edulis) that occurred in New Mexico approximately 1100 to 1400 A.D. (Schoen wetter, 1964; Hall, 1977d). However, the pine pollen grains from Painted Shelter, the Hominy Creek Valley sites, and the un published surface samples from northeastern Oklahoma are morphologically distinct from pinyon pine. PALEOCLIMATIC AND ETHNOBOTANICAL ASPECTS The Painted Shelter pollen record does not indicate any major change in oak forest vegetation throughout the period of sediment accumulation, dating from the 400 A.D. to at least 900 A.D. and perhaps as late as 1300 A.D. The pine rise is probably explained by an increase in abundance of either shortleaf or loblolly pine on the southeastern margin of the Plains. Whether increased pine pollen can be attributed to the migration of pine into the 231</page><page sequence="26">area, forest tree succession, or climatic change cannot at present be anticipated owing to the sparseness of date pollen records from the region. Pollen analyses of late Holocene alluvium and late prehistoric archaeologic sites in the present oak-hickory pine forest of Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Missouri should provide the information necessary to resolve the nature of the pine pollen rise observed at Painted Shelter. Each pollen slide was inspected for rare pollen types, particularly maize (Zea) and squash (Cucurbita). No pollen evidence for either of these plants was seen and there is no aspect of the pollen record at Painted Shelter that would suggest man's presence even through it is evident that the site was occupied for several centuries. MALACOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION Over 1,100 terrestrial snail shells were recovered from 10 cm intervals at Sunny Shelter (340S135) by wet sieving excavated sediment through wire window screen. The overall snail assemblage throughout the rock shelter deposit is dominated by Helicodiscus parallelus and Triodopsis cragini (Figure 22). Both species are abundant members of the modern land snail fauna of the upper Birch Creek Valley. Even though the overall faunal composition is fairly constant in the rock shelter, the relative abundance of H. paral lelus frequencies begin to decrease from about 70 to 40 percent and 7". cragini increases from about 6 to 15 and 30 percent. The environmental preferences of the two snails contrast, as would be expected if the decrease of one and increase of the other occur simultaneously as a result of environ mental change. In Kansas H. parallelus occurs on moist grassy hillslopes (Metcalf, 1962) and in forest litter (Leonard, 1959). In contrast to H. parallelus, which ranges throughout the eastern United States and into the Plains, T. cragini is restricted in distribu tion to a narrow band from east Texas and western Louisiana northward through eastern Oklahoma, western Arkansas, and the cor ners of southeastern Kansas and south western Missouri. In Kansas it occupies dry upland oak forest habitats (Leonard, 1959) and is declared to be "more resistant to dry conditions than any other Oklahoma polygyrid except P. texasiana" (Branson, 1962). If these habitat generalizations apply to the land snail succession at Sunny Shelter on Birch Creek, the increase in T. cragini and the decrease in H. parallelus at the 80 cm horizon may reflect a change in local habitats to drier conditions. The 80 cm horizon falls between two radio carbon dated intervals and is interpolated to be approximately 850 A.D. The land snail record from Sunny Shelter chronologically overlaps the upper half of the Painted Shelter pollen record. However, the shift towards an increase in drier habitats which is suggested by the change in shell frequencies is not duplicated in the pollen sequence. The pollen record shows a continuous oak forest from about 400 A.D. to at least 900 A.D. and perhaps 1300 A.D. It is possible that the Cross Timbers oak forest would persist with little change even though a lower availability of moisture would result in fewer habitats suitable for H. parallelus and a greater abundance of habitats suitable for T. cragini. A paleoenvironmental interpretation of the Sunny Shelter snails should be accepted tentatively, mainly because of the small total number of shells from which the frequencies were calculated. Terrestrial snail studies of archaeologic sites can probably document minor shifts in local environmental conditions and may provide indicies to climatic change of regional extent. However, in order to use snail data with confidence, more shells, probably at least 300, should be recovered from each excavated interval. Also of great importance is the total recovery of the entire snail assemblage using a technique suitable for delicate shell material such as developed by Hibbard (1949). Finally, the study of prehistoric material should be accompanied by a thorough investigation of the modern fauna including its species associations, abundances, and habitats. At present, for example, very little is known about the land snail fauna of Oklahoma except general distribution of species, often only by county, accompanied by vague habitat information. The greatest single restriction on detailed paleoecological studies of mollusks is the lack of knowledge about the living fauna and its environment. 232</page><page sequence="27">Land Snails Os-135 Osage County, Oklahoma i s / * / / / / .* f \ $ * &amp; i i si** * ? i / / ////////// i :i rL j i b 11 ii n: C-14 dates 30 - lOT ii-- i j ) J ' ' L ? : i?, b b i p J - ",.:. ^ fii, ? : :M_blf f M S I U : uJ^L-Li-Li-i-i.l i I l.LlJ L_i_ 1 i 1 i 1 i J LjLUULiUULiLi I i I i I i I 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 % 0 5 Fig. 22.

The paucity of radiometric determinations for the sites precludes the definition of specific temporal intervals for all of their occupations. However, the affiliation of the occupations with a cultural-historical entity, which en compasses some seven centuries, provide for remarkably tight chronologic partitions when compared to other cultural-historical units which span thousands if not tens of thousands of years. The contemporaneity of prehistoric occu pations is often difficult, if not impossible to detect. Establishing the contemporaneity of prehistoric occupations, however, is not crucial to examining the socio-cultural system to which they belonged if it can be demonstrated that the occupations are repre sentative of a discrete socio-cultural system which was in equilibrium (Wobst, 1974:156). The Plains Village Period occupations within the valley would appear to represent a discrete socio-cultural system and territory as indicated by their similarities in material culture inventories and their locations in close proximity to one another within a small drainage basin (Jochim, 1976:86). Addi tionally, the artifactual and paleoenviron mental data which were recovered from the sites indicate both economic and environ mental stability during the Plains Village Period occupations. Apparently, the socio cultural system was in a state of equilibrium and was not undergoing major changes. In that the socio-cultural system was relatively stable, the evidence recovered from the various occupations may be used to identify certain aspects of the adaptive strategy which was employed by the Plains Village Period inhabitants of the valley. Adaptive strategies are principally directed toward the selection and securing of re sources from the environment. Therefore, the availability and scheduling of resources, the location of sites, and the demographic structure of a population are crucial variables influencing an adaptive strategy (Jochim, 1976:11). RESOURCES As in most hunting and gathering econo mic systems, food and water appear to have been the most determinative factors in the prehistoric economy of the valley. Other resources, such as chert and fuel no doubt influenced economic decisions, but because of their absence (i.e. chert) or ubiquitous distribution (i.e. fuel) within the valley, they did not have the importance of food or water. Aside from the Birch Creek, permanent water within the valley is confined to the side tributary of Fourmile Creek and a few springs emerging along the valley's flanks. The principal food resources of the inhabitants of the sites, as defined by the recovered faunal and floral remains, consisted of deer, cottontail rabbit, fish, mussels, and nuts. Although most of the food resources would have been available for exploitation throughout the year, certain resources would have been more abundant or more economi cal to exploit during specific seasons. The fish, particularly gar and catfish, would have been most easily procured during the warmer months as they tend to seek deep pools in large tributaries to spend the winter (Cross and Collins, 1975; Butler, 1977:72). During the late summer and early autumn, when Birch Creek experiences its lowest flow and often develops small isolated pools, stranded fish could have been easily taken by hand if not net or weir. Upstream spring spawners, such as gar and catfish, would have been particularly susceptible to exploitation on their downstream journey at this time of year. Mussel beds would also have been most accessible during this time of low stream level. The reproduction cycle of mussels also induces them to move into shallow water during the late summer and fall (Murray and Leonard, 1962:32). The nut crop of walnuts, hickory nuts, and acorns would have come available for harvest from middle autumn through early winter. Deer would have been most economically exploited in the valley flanks and uplands at this time of year during their aggregation in oak forests for acorn consumption (Smith, 1974:281-287). LOCATIONS OF SITES The distribution of sites within the valley 234</page><page sequence="29">seems to have been strongly influenced by the availability of water, the environmental zones, and the geologic settings. The majority of the sites appear in rockshelters and caves thereby restricting their distribution to the steep cliffs which line much of the valley. Aside from furnishing shelter, the locations of the sites would have provided for the maximum exploitation of diverse environ mental zones. The sites associated with the cliffs are situated along the boundary be tween the upland zone of scrub oaks and grasses and the oak-hickory forests of the valley flanks. In lying between these two environmental zones, the sites would have contained extensive areas of both zones within their catchments in addition to the aquatic environment of the creek in the upper valley. These site catchments would have been most productive from late summer through early winter in respect to fish, mussels, nuts, and deer. The paucity of sites within the lower valley appears to be related to the distance between the valley flank-upland boundary and the Birch Creek channel. Sites situated along this boundary in the narrow upper valley are in close proximity to the stream. In the wider, lower valley the cliff line demarking the valley flank-upland transition is at a considerably greater distance from Birch Creek and the rockshelters within this area lack evidence of occupation. The paucity of occupations in the lower valley is in fact predicted by the regression line computed for the data on arti fact density and distance to water, for the valley flank-upland boundary, evidently the preferred setting for site locations, exceeds the critical 3,500 m to water in most sections of the lower valley (Figure 1). It is notable that although Spring (340S193) exceeds this critical distance from the stream, the site is within 75 m of a spring. The only sites recorded within the lower valley occur as open encampments on the floodplain near the modern channel. DEMOGRAPHICS The number of occupants in the groups which inhabited the sites can be estimated from the floor areas of the shelters. Although an area of 10 m2 per person may be appropriate for estimating the number of residents occupying an artificial dwelling in an agricultural community (Naroll, 1962), an allometric growth model appears to be more applicable for estimating the number of occupants in hunter-gather encampments (Wiessner, 1974:343-349). Based upon an allometric growth model an estimated group population of from 10 to about 15 persons prevails for four of the five excavated Birch Creek sites. Birch Bend Shelter, being markedly larger than the other sites, yields an estimated group population of over 30 persons. However, the shelter's lower than expected artifact density (Figure 19) may indicate that the site was inhabited by smaller groups which, during multiple occupations, spread their activities over the larger area of the shelter (relative to the other sites) and thus reduced the density of artifacts within the shelter's deposit. This proposal is further supported by the fact that Birch Bend Shelter increases the inverse correlation coefficient (-.605) when the artifact densities of the sites are compared to their areas (Figure 18). A weaker correlation coefficient of -.428 is generated when the data for Birch Bend Shelter are deleted from the computations. Had Birch Bend shelter been occupied by groups with sizes commensurate with the area of the shelter, as predicted by the allometric growth model, artifact density should be directly, and not inversely, related to the site area. Based upon the "number of people who can consistently provide members with suitable mates upon reaching maturity" (Wobst, 1974:157, 170) and "the minimum size in which marriage alliances can be maintained with all surrounding bands in definitely" (William, 1974:27), it has been suggested that minimum band size is approxi mately 25 persons. The ethnographic litera ture, in fact, reveals a remarkable cross cultural regularity in hunter-gather societies as bands consistently minimumly contain approximately 25 persons (Wobst, 1974:170; Birdsell, 1968:239; Lee and DeVore, 1968: 244). When these data are compared to the estimated 10 to 15 persons within the groups occupying the Birch Creek Valley sites, it is apparent that the inhabitants of the valley were living in groups which were sub-sets of larger group entities. Furthermore, the evi 235</page><page sequence="30">dence implies that the groups occupying Birch Creek Valley coalesced into larger social units outside the valley sometime during the year. ADAPTIVE STRATEGY Although the sites within Birch Creek Valley appear to represent only part of the settlement pattern of the Plains Village inhabi tants of the region, the investigation of the sites furnishes information on Late Prehistoric adaptive strategies. The valley was apparently occupied from late summer through early winter during times of greatest availability of fish, mussels, nuts, and deer. In addition to the availability of the food resources, the sheltered sites and the prevalence of fuel in the valley would have made it an ideal setting for cold season occupations, perhaps ex tending throughout the winter. Plains Village populations apparently oc cupied the valley in dispersed groups which numbered from 10-15 persons per group. In order to maintain viable populations, the groups must have coalesced sometime during the spring-summer months outside the valley. It is proposed that these microgroups congregated into larger entities, minimally numbering some 25 persons, on the plains near the headwaters of Birch Creek during the spring for bison procurement. The large group size would have been requisite for successful bison hunting (Roe, 1970:630-631) and in turn could have been supported by the greater meat yield of the bison herds. Given this proposition, the bison exploitation would have lasted until middle to late summer when the onset of the rutting season in July to September (Roe, 1970:95-97) would have terminated hunting due to the more aggres sive and alert behavior of the herds (McDer mott, 1940:194). The termination of the hunt would also correspond to the dry season on the Southern Plains when the headwaters of streams and minor tributaries cease to flow. It is at this time that the wooded valleys on the eastern fringe of the grassland would have become attractive for occupation due to their food resources as well as permanent water. 1.
