<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Eloquence of Symbols. Studies in Humanist Art, Edgar Wind, edited by Jaynie Anderson, Oxford University Press, 135 pp., 59 plates, ?25. Edgar Wind is popularly known for his melancholy meditation on modernism, Art and Anarchy, first deliver- ed as Reith Lectures in 1960.1 It makes interesting reading again in the context of today's re-valuation of the modernist tradition. In it he laments the loss of art's dangerous imaginative power and the correponding loss of the public's wonder at that power and the inward vigilance Plato called 'sacred fear'. This double loss he ascribes to a variety of factors including the dissociative and fragmentary character of modern art, art historians' interest in pure form and the connoisseur's attention to isolated detail, the divorce of art and science, the mechanical reproduction of art, and our unlimited tolerance which welcomes all innovation into a 'friendly abyss'. By the end of the book we are left wondering what the connection, cause or meaning of these disparate phenomena might be. This is because Wind makes no reference to the social and economic realities impinging on the cultural sphere. It has recently been forcefully argued by Marshall Berman in All that is Solid Melts into Air2 that this modernist fragmentation and frenetic pace follows on what he calls 'capitalist innovative self-destruction', so eloquently described by Marx in the Communist Mani- festo: Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturb- ance of all social relations, everlasting uncertainty and agitation, distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier times. All fixed, fast-frozen relationships, with their train of venerable ideas and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become obsolete before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and men at last are forced to face with sober senses the real conditions of their lives and their relations with their fellow men.3 For Marx, capitalism causes a spiritual vacuum which in turn makes recognition and subsequently revolution possible. Wind, by contrast, does not suggest a way out of the maelstrom, though he does hint at two possibilities. One is re-awakening of the dormant imaginative power of art: "the past is not destroyed by the present but survives in it as a latent force".4 His other hope is in the reconvergence of art and science, an idea he couches in an image from Kleist's short story 'On the Marionette Theatre': "Having eaten of the tree of knowledge, we cannot slip backwards into paradise: the gate is locked and the angel behind us, but the garden may be open at the other end".5 The second of these proposals had a recent power- ful advocacy in Gombrich's Art and Illusion, in which the logic of scientific discovery provided the model for understanding the progressive refinement of illusionistic codes of representation.6 It is surprising therefore to read Wind's vituperative review of Gombrich's intellectual biography of Aby Warburg, reprinted as an appendix to the present volume of collected essays.7 The review was written for the Times Literary Supplement in 1971, the year of Wind's death. It would seem that Gombrich's close association of art and knowledge left him with little sympathy for Warburg, the investigator of latent imaginative forces in art. According to Wind, Gombrich characterizes War- burg as a Herbartian associationist, while ignoring his innovative use of Robert Vischer's concept of empathy, a notion invented to counter the strictly cognitive Herbartian tradition and to encourage emotional in- volvement in the understanding of art. In my view neither emphasis is accurate. Empathy theory is hardly adequate to inform Warburg's profound sense of the symbol as a condensation of diverse psychological and cultural tensions: yet neither will a purely cognitive theory do. But the debate does serve to underline Wind's sympathy with the principle of emotional investment in images and Gombrich's wariness. This polarity of interest is played out of the review when Wind remarks on a vivid contrast of personalities: 60 THE OXFORD ARTJOURNAL- 7:1 1984</page><page sequence="2">"Cassirer being always impeccably Olympian in the face of Warburg's demonic intensity".9 It is not just a difference of personalities here, but also an implicit opposition between Cassirer's cool neo-Kantian confi- dence in the power of rationality confronting Warburg's grasp of the dialectical tension between reason and the irrational. For Warburg, science grows out of the very fertile soil of magic, myth and ritual, lives in constant danger of being reabsorbed, but withers if cut off from that ground. The intensity of this review reveals how close Wind felt to Warburg although he could not have known him well; they met in 1927 when Warburg was on the point of dying. Wind paid tribute to him shortly after his death in a paper delivered in Hamburg in 1930, 'Warburg's Concept of Kulturwissenschaft and its Mean- ing for Aesthetics', published in this volume translated into English. The essay begins with a critical assault on the highly influential work of Woelfflin and Riegl, who are taken to task for their formalism. While Woelfflin's Principles would be difficult to caricature, the account of Riegl is unjust. For Riegl, form is always meaning- laden; since art constructs relationships between the mind and things, form betrays fundamental episte- mological and emotional relations to the world. This is a far cry from "pure vision". Nevertheless Wind is right to suggest that Warburg's method marks a departure from these generalized theories of visual form and a move toward attention to details of gesture, costume, topoi. Wind gamely attempts to abstract a procedure from Warburg's closely written, close readings of images and documents. He focuses on a central feature of Warburg's thought, his theory of the symbol. Warburg adhered to an evolutionary theory of symbolization. At one end of the polarity there is a "magical-linking" between image and meaning - the bread and wine of the Eucharist both symbolizes and becomes the body and blood of Christ. At the opposite pole the link between image and meaning is a logical, intellectually comprehended relation. In art the terms of the relation are neither fused nor dissociated; it borders on total imaginative engagement and on scientific detachment and so participates in both. This is the wider thesis which underlies Warburg's assessment of the classical tradition. Wind wrote in the introduction to A Bibliography of the Survival of the Classics that Warburg insisted that the two aspects of the classical tradition - sur- vival in the rudimentary forms of magic and lore, and revival as an aesthetic or intellectual ideal - were not to be separated in the study of European civilization. The very peculiarity of the classical tradition, according to him, would seem to lie in its capacity to cause superstition as well as Enlightenment.9 Both the classical tradition and art in general are Janus- faced. The implication would seem to be that the artist is just a little possessed. Even if he was unaware of Freud's researches until late in his life, Warburg's language is retrospectively Freudian when he speaks of Sassetti's references to Fortuna in his will: We still feel why, for Francesco Sassetti, in the crisis which he faced in 1488, it was the storm goddess Fortuna that, symptomatically, crossed the threshold of his consciousness, an index of his heightened state of tension.10 Warburg understands the modes of symbolization both as co-existing synchronic types and as evolutionary stages. His evolutionary model is neither linear nor progressive; there are short-circuits in history, gains and losses: "Human culture evolves toward reason in the same measure as the tangible fullness of life fades into a mathematical symbol". A delicate poise is required to ride the symbol's oscillations. One of Warburg's examples of this poise is Ghirlandaio's use of a highly emotive Roman battle scene on a triumphal arch in his Sacrifice of Zacharius, distanced by its mode of representa- tion, grisaille.'' The Janus-face of art, its power to endanger the unity of the soul or to promote it, is the theme of Wind's important essay called 'Sacred Fear: On Plato's Philosophy of Art'. This essay, appearing here for the first time in English, displays two of Wind's finest qualities, his command of the history of philosophy and his conviction that historical enquiry means making the past bear on the concerns of the present. In this case he grasps the nettle by asking, "How can one justify Plato's subordination of art to the interest of the State?" In answering this question Wind wants both to bear in mind the specific historical circumstances in Athens during Plato's life-time and to confront the philosophi- cal issue at stake and its bearing on our own situation. By doing so he hopes to avoid fusion with his material as well as dissociation from it: the historian requires the same sort of poise as the artist. Wind begins his discussion of Plato with the passage in the Laws where the Athenian is recommending a regulated indulgence in the pleasure of drunkenness as an inoculation against susceptibility to such pleasure. For only when someone has been exposed to the perils of drunkenness can he acquire 'sacred fear'. In the same way, courage must be familiar with the experience of terror. The part of the soul which experiences pleasure and pain must be educated, moulded, so that its impulse accords with reason's insight. Under proper supervision art is capable of harmonizing the parts of the soul; it has a kind of magic power. But, "the same power which serves the state when controlled by it will, if it is not curbed, turns against the state and against the unity of man". 12 The unity of man can be disturbed, for example, by dramatic recitations when we mimic unseemly speech or gesture and identify with ignoble characters: from the imitation we assimilate the reality. In order to avoid this happening, Plato recommends the use of indirect speech which distances the speaker from what he says. It is the oral analogue of grisaille. Immediate and ungoverned response to art fosters the lower part of the soul and diminishes our ability to be guided by reason. Aesthetic pleasure must therefore be strictly subordinat- ed to reason and regulated by the state. Wind tests the cogency of Plato's argument against the views of later writers who wrestled with the same issue - all of whom, in one way or another defended the autonomy of art and aesthetic freedom even if that meant the individual must live in inward conflict or renounce the claims of reason or morality. If the autonomy of art is preserved, then something else must be sacrificed. As Wind points out, the one notable exception is Hegel who was prepared to renounce art or, more exactly, thought Mind aware of itself had already done so. Hegel's remark about images of Greek or Christian Gods, "we no longer bend our knees before THE OXFORD ART JOURNAL- 7:1 1984 61</page><page sequence="3">them", is frequently quoted by Wind to express his own sense of art's impotence in modern society. So, have we lost our 'sacred fear' and opened ourselves up to an autonomous, unregulated art? Or has 'sacred fear' become superfluous in a world where art is marginal, a 'glorious irrelevance'? Curiously, Wind answers both these questions in the affirmative and he is able to do so because he sees that artistic autonomy goes hand in hand with aesthetic detachment. By sheltering art from any conflicting claims, we have allowed it to grow weak. In effect we have renounced the profound pleasures of the imagination in favour of scientific reason. Wind looks back to ancient Greece as a time when conflicting forces were held in a powerful tension generating great strength and vitality. His argument is impressive but, I believe, mistaken because he doesn't acknowledge the continued presence of unmediated attraction and consequent anxiety in our lives. War- burg, on the other hand, saw in contemporary society the 'return of the repressed' in an unexpected guise. At the close of his lecture on Serpent Ritual he writes: The forces of nature are no longer seen in anthropomorphic shapes; they are conceived as an endless succession of waves, obedient to the touch of man's hand. With these waves the civilization of the mechanical age is destroying what natural science, itself emerging out of myth, had won with such vast effort - the sanctuary of devotion, the remoteness needed for contemplation. Whereas Wind saw only aesthetic detachment and scientific 'objectivity' in the modern era, Warburg prophesied a new domination by technology born on waves. Having experienced the invasive, hypnotic power of television and the pervasive encroachment of "information technology", I fear Warburg may have been the more far-sighted. Wind was looking for demonic power in the wrong place and so was unaware of just how possessed we are. If I have occasionally strayed from the book under review, it is a tribute to the thought-provoking essays I have discussed. The same cannot be said of all the essays included in this volume. There are some rather pedantic pieces of iconographia which fail to blossom on to wider issues. The volume is half of a planned pair: Hume and the Heroic Portrait is expected shortly. I would have preferred one volume of Wind's theoretically interesting essays and at ?25 each I think the public would agree. The price is not exhorbitant for such a sumptuously produced book, but I fail to see why it needed to be so grand. The editorial policy of leaving great patches of Greek, Latin and French untranslated into English is also rather grand. It is a shame that Wind's broad range of reference and deep philosophical concern should be made inaccessible to students. As a final caveat I would like to repeat Wind's last words in this volume: "the justified desire to read Warburg undiluted in English cannot be ignored in perpetuity". This collection of essays would make a lot more sense if we had Warburg's too. MARGARET IVERSEN Notes and References 1. Edgar Wind, Art and Anarchy, (London, Faber &amp; Faber, 1963). 2.
