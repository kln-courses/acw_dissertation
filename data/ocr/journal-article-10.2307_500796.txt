<plain_text><page sequence="1">Zeus Herkeios: Thematic Unity in the Hekatompedon Sculptures* THALIA PHILLIES HOWE PLATES 82-84 THE term Hekatompedon sculptures designates the group of poros sculptures that has occasioned much debate as to whether they decorated one or more buildings on the Akropolis.' It is by now generally agreed that several of these figures did come from a single building, namely, the Herakles wrestling Triton, the triple-bodied monster frequently la- belled as the "Bluebeard," the pair of large serpents and at least two large lion groups.2 Recently Dins- moor has added a third lion group and has sum- marized the evidence for assigning all these sculp- tures to one building: ". . . corroboration of the identical source of these is found not only in their place of discovery (all intermingled in a stratum of terrace fill south of the Parthenon) but in their uniformity of scale and of depth of relief and in their material, sculptural style and polychromy ... but also in the technique of their jointing."3 The question then arises as to the identity of the large temple which these monumental sculptures adorned. For the purposes of this paper it does not matter decisively whether they were fitted to the Hekatompedon, the Ur-Parthenon, Heberdey's H- group, to the Pre-Peisistratid temple or any of the other buildings that have been proposed. What this paper purports to show is that each single group of these sculptures was deliberately conceived by the Athenians of the particular time and place of their making (the Akropolis of ca. 570-560 B.c.) to do honor to Athena Polias.4 In addition to con- stituting a sculptural entity, they seem to comprise a conceptual entity as well, one that would seem to be peculiarly suited to the first temple that marked Athena's rise to the domination of the Akropolis-the Hekatompedon, the Temple of Athena Polias. This was dedicated probably in 566 B.c. to celebrate the establishment of the quad- rennial Panathenaic festival.5 An ancient temple was regarded as the house of the god, the place where his representation was kept and honored. Therefore, as Lapalus, Olsen and Picard maintain, the decorations of the temple were chosen on religious grounds, which is to say that they celebrated the god whose house they adorned; they were there not merely to fill a difficult space artistically or to satisfy the immediate mythologi- cal fancies of the artists; they were there because they reflected the immediate desires of the local citizens.' As in the mediaeval period where the artists were as Christian as the rest of the congrega- tion, the ancient sculptor or painter suffered no religious cleavage from the members of his society. His choice of themes was essentially theirs. If we have failed in the past to discern the con- nection between Athena and these sculptures that were found so close to her sanctuary, it is because we have taken too fragmentary a view of them, and have not been willing to go beyond any but the most immediate literal interpretation.' To do so, * I should like to take the opportunity to thank Dr. Oscar Broneer for providing the illustration for plate 82, fig. I, and Dr. Spyridon Marinatos for going to the trouble of verifying information for me in the Akropolis Museum. Also I should like to dedicate this paper to the memory of Barba Thanasios who many years ago, in the hills above Corinth, recounted wonderful tales to me which he claimed were told him by his companion who dwelt in the grove nearby, a long and literate serpent with a great purple beard, without doubt a venerable descendant of Zeus Herkeios himself. 1 W. B. Dinsmoor, "The Hekatompedon on the Athenian Akropolis," AJA 51 (1947) Io9ff., 112 and notes 15 and 18 on p. 145, has summarized to date the arguments on this contro- versial structure and its sculptures. 2 Dinsmoor, op.cit. I 12 and note 18. - Dinsmoor, op.cit. 112, 146-7. As for the stylistic differ- ences between the various sculptures, Dinsmoor explains this as an instance of the "problem of the generations," as based on W. Pinder's thesis, Das Problem der Generation (Berlin 1928). 4 Compare Ch. Picard's analysis of sculptures of the Temple of Athena Alea, REG 46 (1933) 38Iff.; 47 (1934) 385ff.; 48 (1935) 475ff. Also E.

Usually, too, we tend to think of pedimental sculp- tures exclusively in Homeric terms of Olympian hierarchies and make interpretations too narrowly within those limitations. But those were not the only religious beliefs in the archaic Greek world. While intellectually aware of that fact, we too often forget, in application, that prior to the rise of the Olympians and long after, most Greeks were at least as much concerned with chthonic cults, with magic practices and household rites, with rites of purification and orgiastic rites of communion; these and other aspects of religion were all mixed together, without fine divisions between primitive religion, state religion, family cult, magic, Olym- pianism, myth-categories that exist independently as chapter headings of books on Greek religion.' This admixture of beliefs represented Religion to a Greek citizen, particularly prior to the 5th cen- tury, before, that is, the influence of the Olympians did become dominant. In decorating the early tem- ples, therefore, any of these religious sources could be valid thematic material. While it is true that Olympianism, "the theologi- cal and eschatological legacy of Homer,"'o even- tually did become dominant, as K. O. Mueller's famous dissertation on the Eumenides first made evident, this did not take place without a struggle." On Athena's part that struggle is indicated by the Hekatompedon sculptures which still reflect a middle ground of religious belief-not quite Olym- pian and still not simple primitive belief or base superstition. On the one pediment there are, presumably, three groups of sculpture which have nothing to do with each other: to the left Herakles combats the Tri- ton, to the right a large but unidentified monster with three bodies and coiled serpentine tails sits lively and majestic, and in the center two powerful lions tear a prostrate bull.12 It is true that these contiguous scenes have no thematic interrelation, each telling its own story, but in its own way each story renders honor to Athena. It is in that special sense that we can speak of thematic unity in the Hekatompedon sculptures. What each group is celebrating is the struggle of Athena to gain su- premacy over the Akropolis and Attica itself against the contenders Poseidon and Zeus. These sculp- tures indicate not only her victories but also the compromises and concessions that had to be made by the goddess to secure that domination.'3 As we observe first the group of Triton and Herakles, it requires no great stretch of the imagi- nation to realize that the defeat of Poseidon is sym- bolized in that combat.14 Yet how can we be sure? After all, legend has it that Herakles fought the Triton in order to reach the Garden of the Hesperi- 136. Also, as Olsen cautions, in order to avoid too narrow an interpretation: "The ultimate meaning in every group involves something more than the identity of any individual figure," op.cit. (supra n. 4) 284. 8 Here I would agree with Olsen and would also apply to the 6th century the kind of interpretation he allowed for the 5th, op.cit. (supra n. 4) 276ff.: ". . . it is to belittle the intelligence and sensitivity of the Greeks as human beings to assume that they would tolerate the application of com- pletely irrelevant scenes on their temples. Such an assumption puts an extremely low value upon the temple as the house of a deity. . . . I am not unconscious of the fact that this inter- pretation involves a fifth century artistic principle which has been little recognized. The god is commemorated and worshipped, not by representing an image of him as he per- forms one of the deeds attributed to him, but by selecting from the common fund of myth and legend the events in which the god's particular power is seen to be at work. It is not difficult to establish this principle in fifth century literature and sculpture, or to trace its basis in a relatively abstract aspect of contemporary religion." 9 E. Rohde, for example, in his Psyche contended that Homer constituted an artificial break in the continuity of Greek religion, which comprised these other elements. W.

But, as Carl Robert stated, this is a later, aetio- logical addition to the myth, a rationalizing attempt to explain why Herakles fights sea-monsters, vague generalized fears of the sea."5 Is it not significant that in choosing subjects from Herakles' Twelve Erga and the Parerga, those numerous contests in- cidental and auxiliary to the Labours (not to men- tion Herakles' other, military ventures), out of all this legion of exploits the Athenians chose practi- cally the only one that shows Herakles defeating a sea-creature, a minor episode that was only very incidental to a main Labour ? Yet it must have been an important selection for the Athenians, since they rendered it again shortly after on an- other Akropolis pediment." Why did they not choose instead the contest that was most popular among the vase painters for instance, the fight with the Nemean lion?18 Because the Nemean lion would have had no meaning on the house of Athena, whereas the Triton did. He was the alter aspect of Poseidon whose defeat the Athenians wished to show. Then too, the Athenians might have chosen other legends in which heroes destroy sea-beasts, for example, the destruction of Ketos by Perseus,1" or Herakles' own slaughter of a sea-beast, similar to Ketos, which attacked Hesione. But these were not chosen because neither Ketos nor the other monster had the same close relation to Poseidon as did Triton, the god's own son. Herakles, too, was the logical hero to choose, rather than, say, Perseus, for he was the goddess's favorite hero.20 In using the Herakles-Triton theme to sym- bolize the defeat of Poseidon, instead of overtly ex- pressing it, as was done for instance on the later temple of Athena Polias, the Parthenon, it would seem that the Athenians chose this device because they were as yet not ready to show the defeat of a god openly, at least not in so bold and conspicuous a form as pedimental sculpture. Therefore, the ag- gression was poeticized, masked. But by under- standing why Poseidon's defeat was desired in the first place, we can begin to understand better the reasons for Athena's rise to the domination of At- tica and the celebration of that rise on these sculp- tures. The Poseidon of the early 6th century was not as yet the developed Olympian type that is met with in the Parthenon theomachy; he is still closer to his original, more primitive concept as implied in his name, "Consort of the Earth." Lord of fresh water as well as of the sea, he is, as Farnell has shown,"2 the fertilizer of the earth. As such, Posei- don is close to the fertility powers so important to an agricultural community of the sort that Attica still was in the 6th century, and which, therefore, regarded him as more of a power and consequent- ly more of a threat to the rising urban Athena, than was true in the later period. But more will have to be said on this subject later. A problem of more positive, but more complex solution, is represented by the figure at the other angle of this same pediment, the enigmatic snake- tailed monster with three torsos and heads, which has generally been interpreted as the sea-demon, 15 C. Robert, Die griechische Heldensage II (Berlin 1921) PP. 437, 499, 506. References to Herakles' fight with a sea- monster occur as early as Homer, 11. 20, 145.

It is also of interest to note that the Triton myth was important only in the 6th century, falling almost into oblivion after the 5th, as Robert points out.

Also the creature has numerous other attributes which have no possible connection with the Tritopatores, and which must be explained.25 According to the account of the 5th century B.c. mythographer, Pherekydes, Herakles wrestled with the sea-demon Nereus, or Halios Geron, or Proteus, who attempted to elude him by changing into fire and water.26 Proteus, the Halios Geron of Homer, when eluding Menelaos, not Herakles, was further transformed into a lion, leopard, dragon, boar and tree." However, it is important to note that this transformation took place only during the actual combat, a fact also borne out by all the known illus- trations of the scene.28 Otherwise, even in most combat scenes, and always when not in combat, the creature has a single human form at least to the waist. Usually he is completely anthropomorphic and identifiable only by an accompanying inscrip- tion or by being represented as bald or white- haired."9 In view of this description, how is it pos- sible to regard the Hekatompedon sculpture as one of these sea-demons since he is not engaged in conflict and yet is unquestionably in complex, triple form? However, one may be willing to waive that par- ticular point and regard the figure as an exception, arguing that the attributes of the creature are still so unmistakably those of a sea-demon that this variation from the customary form of representa- tion does not present an insuperable objection. What specifically, then, are these attributes of the triple-bodied figure and how well do they sustain the evidence for a sea-creature who could also be fire, as well as creatures such as a lion or a dragon? Water, the first of these elements, is symbolized by the object held in the hand of the torso closest to the center of the pediment: it is rectangular, blunt at both ends and decorated by a series of parallel wavy striations. The other object, which is very similar, but differs in tapering at one end and in having striations much less wavy, is often believed to represent fire, though Jacobsthal has demon- 22F. Brommer, Marburger Winckelmannprogramm (1947) 4ff., lists the bibliography to date on the various interpretations of this creature, including Typhon, Tritopatores, Erechtheus, Aigaion-Briareus, Nereus, Halios Geron, Proteus, "unknown sea-creature," and "unknown."

I4) 433ff., 450ff.; in SBBay (I906) 149 he also assigns this to a pediment different from that of the Triton group. Schweitzer, op.cit. (supra n.

The earliest references to the Tritopatores come from the second half of the 5th c. B.C. AA 27 (I912) 29. Also E. Wilst, RE s.v. "Tritopatores." Earlier, Brueckner had regarded this figure as a Typhon, AM 14 (1889) 70ff., as have Wiegand, op.cit. (supra n. 12) pp. 75ff., figs. 82, 83, 88, 89; Heberdey, op.cit. (supra n. 12) pp. 63ff., pls. 3, 4; and Robert, op.cit. II (supra n. 15) pp. 507ff.; Brommer, op.cit. (supra n. 22). These have based their as- sumptions on Euripides' reference to a triple-bodied Typhon (Her. Fur. I27Iff.), and a vase painting of a Typhon holding a thunderbolt. But according to Hesiod, Th. 82Iff., Typhon had a hundred heads of dragon shape, and when he stole Zeus' thunderbolt he was destroyed by the god and buried under Aetna. It is the usual gigantomachy theme, which, when ren- dered in monumental art, usually does not depict the giants, the aggressors, in the quiescent and triumphant attitude and position of this Hekatompedon figure. Moreover, as can be demonstrated, this figure has several attributes which cannot be understood in terms either of a Typhon or the Tritopatores.

In other words, the Hekatompedon figure has no attribute that represents fire exclusively, one of the fundamental forms of transformation of Nereus in combat. Of equally ambiguous interpretation is the coiled snake-tail of the monster, as well as the snakes about its shoulders. These may identify the dragon aspect mentioned by Homer in connection with Proteus,31 but far more commonly in Greek thought the snake represented the underworld. So far then, on the positive side, this creature has one attribute which symbolizes water exclusively, and others of ambiguous interpretation answering either to fire, a dragon, or the underworld. So far these are not very convincing evidence in support of a marine interpretation for this creature. They become even less so as we observe several contemporary il- lustrations of Nereus and Halios Geron which de- pict them with attributes that are admirably ap- propriate. These illustrations are on five contemporary monuments of the first half of the 6th century, an Argive-Corinthian bronze, a Boeotian lekythos and amphoriskos, a fragmentary Samian hydria and an Attic krater, all of which show a consistent por- trait of the sea-demon82 which in turn also agrees with the literary descriptions:33 Herakles grapples with a figure either bald or semi-bald, labelled Ha- lios Geron or Nereus, who has a single long fish- tail, or once, one that ends in a crab-claw, also a marine designation. From its back there rises a snake and sometimes it holds one in its hands. In one case an animal head resembling a panther's also rises from its back, and on another example an attribute probably correctly interpreted as fire ap- pears there. These illustrations, particularly with their main emphasis on the great fish-tail, are en- tirely in agreement with the literary accounts and with the whole legend of this contest, but they dis- agree markedly with the Hekatompedon enigma who sits uncontested and in archaic splendor with three torsos and heads that are such careful coun- terparts of each other that they must represent one figure, one idea triply emphasized, rather than three diferent figures in one, which would be the case involving separate and complex transforma- tions. Then there are other things that must be ac- counted for. How are we to explain the three hu- man torsos and the heads so markedly vigorous and youthful?" What of the bird? Then there are the great wings, and, because they are so frag- mentary, we tend to forget how they must have en- framed and dominated the figure. These, in no ambiguous terms, powerfully signify the realms of air, yet nowhere in the literature or on the illustra- tions is there any reference to this element. Along the same lines of argument, if this be the Halios Geron, there also does not seem to be any satis- factory explanation as to why the artist should have substituted the snake-tails for the normal fish-tail, the attribute most characteristic of the sea-beast. If, as has been suggested, we regard this as symbolic of the dragon aspect, it would seem to be placing disproportionate emphasis on a very minor aspect. And to argue, as Buschor does,"8 that the snake- 30 Dickins, op.cit. (supra n. 12) pp. 79, 80, n. I. Wiegand, op.cit. (supra n. 12) 77, 78ff., pl. 4. L. Curtius, SBBayer. Stud. z. altorient.

Certainly it would have given the whole pediment the very symmetry that was achieved on the rear pediment where the angles are filled by the two undulating tails of the large serpents. Thus the artist might have achieved a simple pattern of two snake-tails on the rear and two fish-tails on the front, a desirable and obvious symmetry.36 But patently he was not free to choose between two kinds of tails, for the creature he was illustrating was not conceived of as fish-tailed to begin with. Instead, the attributes of the creature are carefully calculated by their size, number and relative importance to inform the spectator that this is a creature which, by its dominant wings, the bird and the one attribute in the hand, represents first and foremost Air; then by its triple, coiled tails, and the shoulder-snakes, the Earth and the world under it; and by the one object held in the hand, and that only to a minor degree, Water. To my knowledge there is only one deity of this period who ever came close to representing all three of these elements simultaneously, and that was Zeus in his lesser aspect of Herkeios. Zeus Herkeios, a deity little known to us, was to the ancients a very common god of the house- hold, yet so familiar and homely that he was ordi- narily overlooked by serious art and literature, and, if lack of illustration be any indication, was neg- lected by even the lesser craftsmen. But there was another, more important explanation for what seems like lack of interest, as we shall see. What we know of the appearance and nature of this triple Zeus has been pieced together mostly by Farnell."7 His evidence comes chiefly from Pausani- as' account of an Argive xoanon of Zeus"8 which had three eyes and symbolized the familiar god of the Heavens united with the Zeus Catachthonios mentioned by Homer and Euripides, and with the Zeus Enalios mentioned by Aischylos and other sources."9 As the ancient traveler states: "Whoever made the image made it with three eyes as sig- nifying that this same god rules in all the three allotments of the universe as they are called." And, as Farnell comments, a figure of three eyes was the only way the primitive artist knew how to portray the god who looked to the heavens, the earth and the water. The artist of the primitive xoanon was as yet unable to open the hands of the figure and put in it a bird, or bolt, or any attribute at all, and he was even less capable of 36Dinsmoor, op.cit. (supra n. I) 112, note I8. 87Farnell, op.cit. (supra n. 21) pp. Io3ff. Max Mayer, Die Giganten u. Titanen, pp. III-I4ff., thinks the figure was a Cyclops. See Farnell's comment on this, p. 104, n. a. 38 Paus. 2, 24, 3 (ed. W. H. S. Jones, Heinemann): "Here are placed votive offerings, including a wooden image of Zeus, which has two eyes in the natural place and a third on its fore- head. This Zeus, they say, was a paternal god of Priam, the son of Laomedon, set up in the uncovered part of his court, and when Troy was taken by the Greeks Priam took sanctuary at the altar of this god. . . . The reason for its three eyes one might infer to be this. That Zeus is king in heaven is a saying common to all men. As for him who is said to rule under the earth, there is a verse of Homer which calls him, too, Zeus: 'Zeus of the Underworld, and the august Persephonia' [II. 9, 457]. The god in the sea, also, is called Zeus by Aeschylus, the son of Euphorion. So whoever made the image made it with three eyes as signifying that this same god rules in all the three 'allotments' of the Universe as they are called." Paus. 8, 46, 2: "For when Troy was taken and the Greeks were dividing up the spoils, Sthenelus the son of Capaneus was given the wooden image of Zeus Herceius (of the Courtyard)." Schol. Eur. Tr.

Fundamentally the artist had to render simultane- ously actions which are in reality successive in space, if not in time. By comparison, then, the seemingly clumsy conception of the Hekatompedon triple-bodied god with his burden of symbols seems highly imaginative and executed with great tech- nical skill. While we might expect the god of the Upper Air to have so many and such dominant attributes to represent that element, it is particularly interesting that the snake-tail was not only a convenient artistic symbol, but was also probably characteristic of Zeus Herkeios at all times. Certainly it can be shown that he had other snaky connections. As Jane Harrison indicated, and later Sjoevall in his study of Zeus as household deity, Herkeios was closely associated with Zeus Ktesios, the snake-god who guarded the household provisions, and also with the Agathos Daimon whose usual appearance was that of a snake.41 Therefore, Zeus Herkeios himself, by vir- tue of the fact that he was also god of the under- world, may well have been conceived of as part snake. This conception of the triple Zeus is identified further on an Attic painting of the early 5th cen- tury,42 presented exactly as we might expect of an artist of this period of anthropomorphic realism: by three separate figures of Zeus virtually identical of face and form. They are tall, slender, bearded and of great power and vigor. They compare with the god of the Hekatompedon who is also powerful and has three identical torsos and heads, though con- ceived according to the tastes of a different age. The Zeus figures of the vase painting are differentiated only slightly by dress and by the attributes in their hands which include the trident, thunderbolts and the aforementioned symbol for lightning which was held by the sculpture." To this artist, however, the chthonic Zeus was unimportant and he omitted any attributes of this aspect, but still the idea is there simply by virtue of the fact that the third figure was retained; the idea was not reduced to two. Furthermore, von Paucker draws attention to the curious curl in the middle of the forehead of each, which he believes is not a curl, but an at- tempt to suggest a third eye. In making a final resume of these three illustra- tions of the Zeus of the realms, it is evident that their apparent large differences were due only to the stages of technical development and the aes- thetic tastes of the different ages in which they were conceived and executed: the primitive period could designate the idea only by a xoanon with three eyes; the classical, though realistic and an- thropomorphic, no longer had the taste for gross literalism and so it represented three separate figures of Olympian stature holding symbols. It was only the technically skilled and freely imaginative 6th century that expressed without sophisticated re- straint its conception of one god in three guises. This 6th century artistic formulation of Zeus Her- keios was without antecedents, a unique trial and a failure, but one that stood logically in point of development between the other two. Even if it be granted that this sculpture rep- resents Zeus Herkeios, it still remains to be demon- strated how this god came rightly by his place on the pediment of the house of Athena Polias. And how did it come about that the god of the vast realms of air, water and the underworld who had a considerable cult as such in Olympia and Argos, the principal centers of his worship, was confined in Athens to back-stairs worship, so to speak?44 Sjoevall in his study on the house-cults of Zeus 40 H. Sjoevall views this tripling of the eyes as another manifestation of the people's "belief in the superhuman power of the god through the multiplicity of his parts." op.cit.

Deonna, "Unit6 et Diversit6," RA I (1914) 39ff., who is illuminating on the problem of the manifestation of these multiple-figures, the difficulties the artists faced in illustrating them and the expedients they used in arriving at solutions. Many of the functions of the gods in the physical world simply could not be expressed easily and with clearness on the monuments. As Farnell queries, what for instance could have been the representation in the archaic period of Zeus as the god of rainfall? 41 J. Harrison, Themis (Cambridge 1912) p. 299 quotes Dionysios of Halikarnassos, Antiquitates Romanae I, 67, 3, who describes the Penates: "But those who translate the word [Penates] into Greek render it, some as 'Patrioi,' some as 'Genethlioi,' some again as 'Ktesioi,' others as 'Mychioi,' oth- ers as 'Herkioi.' Each and all these translators seem to adopt a word according to what has occurred to themselves, and they all mean pretty much the same." [my emphasis T.H.] Sjoevall, op.cit.

He has found evidence of his worship by the temple of the goddess, presumably Hera, at Tiryns; it was at Herkeios' altar, too, that Priam was slain."5 Similarly, at Athens Zeus Herkeios had had his place on the Akropolis for a long time, originally in the house of the Mycenaean kings,46 and in later times his cult was maintained at an altar that stood in the Pandroseion, under the shade of the sacred olive tree itself." Each Attic home, too, had its altar of Zeus Herkeios in the court- yard.48 By degrees since Homeric times this deity had been absorbed into every household from the royal household and had become the cult center of the family around which evolved ideas of kinship and morality. As Sjoevall points out, Herkeios was but another of Zeus' many forms as "Beschiitzer." The name "Herkeios" is derived from the word EpKo0, originally defined as the "wattle-fencing, usually the wall of a precinct," and precinct, like templum, being either an open space, or, later, a sanctuary.49 Hence Zeus Herkeios was predomi- nantly an apotropaic power, one which had been at home for a long time on the Akropolis. And since he offered no aggression to Athena, her wor- shippers and the builders of her sacred temple set him on high on the front pediment to function as its benign guardian. Finally, we might ask, on tak- ing leave of the point, where on the Akropolis or in the Lower Town or in the whole of Attica did the Halios Geron have any such cult worship at all? How then could he have merited a position of such importance on the temple? It is my opinion that in the two great snakes which fill the angles of the rear pediment, we see additional aspects of a benignly disposed Zeus.SO These undulate in imposing scale to their bearded heads that high above the Attic plain stare straight out at the oncoming spectators. Scholars have made practically no attempt in the past to interpret these snakes as other than vaguely anonymous reptilian apotropaia,51 perhaps representative of the one or ones that attended the infant Erichthonios,52 or of the OLKovpOv Oetv, the snake that guarded the citadel, as Herodotos tells us.53 While it is undoubt- edly true that such local concepts probably, in part at least, did underlie the selection of these snake- forms these were not the only reasons. Especially in the case of the snake-guardians of Erichthonios we might do well to ask whether such super- numerary creatures were important enough to mer- it representations so vigorous and so imposingly placed? Would not Erichthonios himself, or cer- tainly Erechtheus, have been more to the point as symbols of the citadel?" Yet apparently even these ancient and honored figures were not regarded as worthy enough. Perhaps, then, these Hekatompe- don reptiles represented instead the citadel snake itself who was shown twice in order to fill out both 45Farnell, Higher Aspects of Greek Religion (New York 1940) pp. 30, 51, 60o; Cults I, pp. 157-58.

Surely there was enough other snaky-tailed material, significant to the Akropolis, which could have been used in order to avoid mere repetition. Cecrops, for instance, should certainly have been suited to the site and the other angle if it were merely snake-tailed local "color" they were after. Moreover his role as judge of the contest between Poseidon and Athena ought to have been sufficient to warrant his inclusion among the sculptures in honor of Athena Polias. But apparently neither Cecrops, the mythical snake-tailed first king of Athens, nor his successor Erechtheus, nor Erech- theus' counterpart, Erichthonios, intimately in- volved though they were with the history of the Akropolis, were worthy of being mounted on the Hekatompedon pediments. The reason for their exclusion seems to come down to this-these spaces were reserved instead for figures of Olympian struggle. What, then, could these Hekatompedon snakes have symbolized to Athenians of that century? In addition to the royal snake of the citadel, the Athenians revered his more humble counterpart, Zeus Ktesios, who was worshipped at every local hearth in snake form.56 He was the protector of the hearth and of the household provisions and his image stood in the storeroom.5 While his cult was widespread locally, it was originally, and most always, an unimposing one. By the time of Aischy- los, however, the ancients held to the notion that a household could not only protect its possessions but could actually augment them with Ktesios' help."8 This would indicate, as Sjoevall points out, a very great broadening of the god's powers, from simple guardian to a productive, active force.5" This extension of his powers would justify cer- tainly Ktesios' elevation to the great pediment, which took place in the very period when Athens, roused and stabilized by Solon, was undergoing drastic economic development. That Zeus Ktesios was something more than a domestic watch-dog is also indicated by the fact that the god had not only private but public altars as well. Like Zeus Herkeios, Ktesios had a special veneration at Athens, more so than in any other locality, as Farnell and Sjoevall make clear.60" Fi- nally, so important, not to say threatening, does the worship of Ktesios seem to have become, that the goddess arrogated his powers and was worshipped as Athena Ktesia."6 Something of this struggle and arrogation is symbolized, I believe, by the presence of the great reptiles on the temple of Athena Polias. The goddess allows Zeus a place of honor on her temple as a way of indicating her assumption of his power. What had originally been a simple apo- tropaic cult of the household had become, under political and economic pressure, an active produc- tive force which was then made to serve the city as well and to guard the house of Athena and its treasure beneath.62 It might be for these reasons that the Hekatompedon snake rears with great, "5 It was only in late times that it was believed that there were two temple guardian snakes: Hesychius s.v. olKOvpbS 0(PLSt. Photius Lex. s.v. otKOUpbV V6LP. 56E.

The one other important form of snake-worship in Attica was dedicated to Zeus as Meilichios. In fact, Thucydides specifies that toward the close of the 7th century the Diasia, the festival held in honor of Meilichios, was the greatest of the Attic festivals for Zeus.63 The Diasia was an agricultural rite, held outside the city, as Thucydides says, and to it the citizens brought country-side sacrifices. As Aristophanes also reveals, by his time it had dwindled to a "family feast and country-fair, a proper place to buy a toy-cart for a little boy.""4 But in the mid-6th century Zeus Meilichios was still a potent deity. Nowhere else did he receive a greater worship than in Attica where he had some five sanctuaries," quite as we might expect in an agricultural community whose feeble soil had ever yielded only niggardly gains. In view of this pau- city of agrarian production any fertility god or power in Attica was bound to be much venerated and propitiated.6" Meilichios was particularly so, as Nilsson points out, for the god's very name sig- nifies "the One who has been Propitiated." As Far- nell states, Meilichios must be propitiated in order that the season of fertility may return again."7 Har- rison, too, remarks that Meilichios must have been regarded as an important source of wealth, since holocausts, not just tidbits, were his offerings, to mollify his dreadful and grudging powers.68 From what is generally known of the role of the snake in connection with such fertility cults69 it is not surprising that Zeus Meilichios was angui- form, as can be proven from several illustrations, particularly on certain reliefs from the Peiraeus. Some of these, of the 3rd century B.c., still rep- resent the god as he had appeared on the Heka- tompedon pediment, undulant, bearded and with wide jaws of great venom and aggression.70 It was no gentle collection of guardians that Athena was gathering on her temple, and it is surely a notable mark of her own tremendous powers that she was able to curb and rally these gods of hearth and field, Zeus Ktesios and Zeus Meilichios. In view of the importance of these anguiform dei- ties in Attic cult worship it seems reasonable to suppose that it was they whom the citizens of Athens recognized as they approached from below. For, indeed, what other beliefs in snake form in Athens at this time were of more importance to her people? We turn to the final problem, one of considerable complexity, the lion motifs that are repeated three times on this single temple. A single idea that is thrice hammered in must have arisen from a very great need to reiterate an emphatic and powerful cult belief.71 In one of the scenes a pair of lions sits quietly, and in the other two scenes lions tear a bull. What, in essence, is the theme about? It is a bouphonia, a bull-slaying, shown with great power and once even with such ferocity that the blood of 63 Thuc. I, 126. 0.

Since we have seen Poseidon in the guise of Triton bested already on this temple, it would be easy to regard this as another, more thorough expression of the same wish. Undeniably there is a certain validity to such an interpretation, but it cannot be the main interpretation chiefly because Poseidon in bull form, while very prominent in other parts of Greece, was of no local importance. As for Dionysos, it was all very well for the an- cient hymn to sing in his honor the bull-driving dithyramb :74 In Spring-time, O Dionysos, To thy holy temple come, To Elis with thy Graces, Rushing with the bull-foot, come, Noble Bull, Noble Bull. But this is written of the Dionysos of Elis. While that god played a part impressive enough in Attic ritual to give rise to the drama, he was not featured locally in his bull aspect. Nor was his death cele- brated in bull form in the Aiora, the Attic Swing- ing Festival held in his honor. The only god of the three whose bull aspect had any significance in At- tica was Zeus, and this was significant indeed. It is my belief, therefore, that these bouphonia scenes represent the Bouphonia, the central ritual of the Dipoleia, one of the oldest ceremonies of Attic worship. In spite of Thucydides' remark on the Di- asia,"7 this was at least as important a festival in Athens prior to the consecration of the Panathe- naia.7" The Dipoleia was held in honor of Zeus Polieus and derived its name from his." Its rites were markedly primitive, of the stuff that furnish the anthropologist and student of early religion with much material and insight:7" briefly, an ox was annually slain at the altar of Zeus Polieus, and his flesh was eaten at a communal feast, a dais.7" But his hide was stuffed with hay, sewn together, then yoked and set to the plough. At the same time, this sacrifice was so perilous, so charged with magic and mana, that the participants ceremonially ac- cused each other in turn of the murder of the sacred bull until finally the guilt descended to the sacrificial weapon which was formally tried in the courts for murder and sentenced to death by drown- ing.so For a long time it has been argued whether this was a harvest ceremony, one intended to in- sure the first-fruits of the following year, or whether it was totemic in origin, and communally shared in order to strengthen the ties of kinship between the citizens and the divinity or divine power rep- resented by the bull.8' In either case, what is im- portant at this time is to realize this: though the bull had come to be regarded by the fifth century as the animal offered up to sacrifice in honor of Zeus Polieus, he was originally (and apparently as late as the 6th century) regarded as the actual deity himself.82 Jane Harrison makes this point clear in 72The aggression toward the bull is unmistakable as these descriptions from Dickins' Cat. of the Acropolis Museum will testify: "The group represents a bull pulled down by two lions who pin him from opposite sides by his horns and left hind leg, while they rest their weight on his body and dig their claws into his side. The bull is thus pressed down flat against the ground . . ." pp. 67, 68-9; in describing the lioness de- vouring the bull: "The bull is crushed flat, his head pressed down between his shoulders and his forelegs splayed out .. ." pp. 76-7.

But the reason Zeus Polieus was represented as slain, and, further, as symboli- cally slain on Athena's temple, are questions that must occupy us more closely. The reason for the symbolic slaying is not hard to find. The Greeks of this period, at least, did not represent ritual ceremonies literally. To show a dying bull was easy, but to have represented him with priests, water-carriers, knife-sharpener and at- tendants was unthinkable in the archaic period, and, instead, the animal slaying motif was substituted, a scheme both familiar and effectively adaptable to the gable shape. But the second point is more dif- ficult to explain: the relationship of Zeus Polieus to Athena Polias. In explicating this it is essential to realize that the bull is being shown as either in the act of being slain or as already powerless and about to be dismembered by the lion. In other words here the god is definitely not being honored, but, quite the opposite, is being shown by the Athenians as defeated and powerless. Why? A clue to the answer is indicated by a quotation from Aristophanes' Clouds where Injustice de- scribes the austere education of former days as "old- fashioned and Dipoleia-like, and full of grasshop- pers and of Kerkydes and of the Bouphonia."" If by that period the old crude rites of imitative magic were already reduced to something embar- rassing and foolish, this denigrating attitude must have had its beginnings at least by the 6th century, and for the same reasons that were indicated ear- lier in connection with the worship of Ktesios: once-important deities of agriculture were passe, no longer sufficient to a community that was begin- ning to expand into a commercial center and to aspire to urban sophistication.8" This economic shift had begun when Solon had relieved somewhat the backward economic conditions of the 7th century by his land and debt reforms." But Solon still could not alter the soil that had been impoverished to the limit. Hence, as the gods associated with trade and the city were fostered by the local in- habitants, the agricultural ones who had failed were ground under heel and abused. There would seem to be a considerable contra- diction in this discussion of the aggressive handling of Zeus Polieus, for in discussing Zeus Herkeios, Ktesios and Meilichios it was shown, presumably, that in these particular aspects the god was being honored. Then to turn about abruptly and attempt to demonstrate that the same god was now being torn to pieces by the same worshippers-that seems too much. But that is exactly what did happen in actual cult worship. The former and milder aspects were honored and kept intact, while the more threatening power of Polieus required that the god be torn to pieces. The ambivalence and contradic- tion was of the Athenians' own making. And even more, these ambivalent feelings were directed not only toward different aspects of the same god but even toward diflerent phases of the same aspect. For example, toward the agricultural Zeus Polieus the Athenians exhibited violent aggression, a de- sire for riddance and ridicule, as Aristophanes shows; on the other hand, they cultivated with great respect that phase of Polieus which fitted in with their civic, non-agrarian scheme. Witness: in his capacity as Polieus, Zeus was not only the bull of rustic fertility, he was also Boulaios and as such was required to look after and reorganize the 83 Harrison and Verrall, Myth. and Mon. p. 427, fig. 37; Themis, p. 145, fig. 25.

CAH IV, pp. 26ff., 38ff., 6Iff., 595ff. vividly points out how the Athenians took virtually no part in the economic and colonial movements of the 8th and 7th centuries, but relied still on agriculture which had been worked to the limits. "Once the economic pressure was relieved, the Anthenians soon learnt to make full use of their national opportunities and gifts of mind." But operating rapidly as they had to in moving with haste to make up for lost time economically speaking, the Athenians also rapidly modernized their gods, rendering them more aggressive and forceful. It should also be noted in con- nection with these economic developments that in one of Solon's ventures, the wresting of Salamis from Megara and the re- duction of the latter's naval operations in local waters in 570 B.c., Peisistratos first gained his reputation. Although he re- mained the local hero between 570-565, we do not know how much the future tyrant had to do with the Hekatompedon and its appointments. Since, however, he regarded Athena as his patron goddess and had much to do with the initiation of her great festival, he may also have had some ideas concerning the selection of the Hekatompedon sculptural theme.</page><page sequence="13">1955 ] ZEUS HERKEIOS 299 clan system of the city; the civic administrators prayed to him in the council-chamber for legal help, and his statue, a very ancient xoanon, stood by them as they deliberated.88 Religious notions in a period of development such as this are complex indeed, so that it is possible for one phase of one aspect to be rejected while another is kept and strengthened.89 The cruder side of Zeus was gotten rid of to clear the way for his urban administrative potentialities, and, by the same token, for those of Athena Polias; but more, to allow for the rise of his intellectual preeminence, the preeminence that characterized the Olympian Zeus himself and with which the phase of the civic Zeus-Polieus-Boulaios fitted in. In discoursing thus on the rise of Athena and Zeus and of the concentration of power in her hands, which is the essence of this paper, it is neces- sary to point out that at the same time Athena was herself undergoing an analogous rise to the role of Athena Polias and Boulaia.90 In the race for Attic supremacy it would seem that Athena ran parallel to Zeus. As Ktesia, Boulaia and Polias she won the race and once again she arrogated Zeus' title. His most important title locally became her most important name. Perhaps it is for this reason, to stress her victorious assumption of the title of Polias, that the Dipoleia theme is cen- trally placed and reiterated on the pediments of her temple. In any case her triumph over Zeus was so assured that the Panathenaia,"9 became her triumphal procession and the Hekatompedon her trophy. But she won the contest because she had the one prime element in her character which Zeus, for all his political beneficence, did not have: she was the goddess of war, of the art of war. Hers was an aggressive temperament better adjusted to the needs of incipient empire than his.92 Thus, in addition to her domestic, political and social aspects which she exemplified as Ktesia, Boulaia and Polias, and which she shared with the peaceable Olympian Zeus, there was inseparably blended her craft for imperial dominance. Zeus Polieus, consequently, was eventually forced to bow to Athena Polias, he placed the sacrificial utensils of his rites in her temple treasury on the Akropolis"9 while he him- self departed to the new temple built for him be- low in the Lower Town by Peisistratos.94 Athena's supremacy on the citadel was secure, while only Polieus' statue and altar were left up above and simply "continued to be the scene of the earliest sacrifice on the citadel with Boutes as priest.""95 While we have tried to account at least for the role of the bull in these pedimental sculptures, we had best examine, even briefly, before leaving the point altogether the role of the lion. As was previously stated, the lion and bull formed a con- venient aesthetic, familiar motif, but that again does not wholly account for the role of the lion, particularly of the non-combative pair. It might be enough to indicate that the lion was the "nat- ural" choice for representation, in lieu of the realis- tic ritual slaying, because only he had the right, given by might, to pull down the bull, the divine "lord of the forest.""9 In contrast, the bull is a familiar beast, while the lion is not, and, in fact, it is questionable whether the mainland Greeks of this period ever saw one alive. For them he occu- 88 Paus. 1, 3, 4; 1, 24, 4. Antiphon 6, 45 (ed. L. Gernet, Paris 1923) p. I55. CIA III, 683; ibid. 272, 1025. Farnell, Cults I, pp. 56ff., n. Iio; Higher Aspects p. 68.

What the symbolic intent is, however, in the case of the quiescent lions it is not possible to state, nor will it be until the whole question of the lion and its significance in Greek art and life is thoroughly examined. One can only offer the meagrest sug- gestions and those with hesitancy. The artist seems to have intended to counterbalance one combative group by the other pair of large, but inactive beasts, so that there is a crude notion of action and stasis counterposed. But that would only indicate the aesthetic intent behind the choice and not the sym- bolic. I can only suggest that the quiet beasts sat like great powers, sated and benign and willing for the time being to pass as apotropaia,9 rather than as executioners. Possibly the whole role of the lion on the Hekatompedon might indicate a con- temporary attempt by the Athenians to force this beast into their local mythology, to make it an at- tribute of Athena, if not actually an aspect of the goddess herself. As the acknowledged king of the beasts, the lion was, perhaps, a challenge to the Olympianizing activity of the period. But any such attempt was doomed to failure, for the lion was forever too wild and intractable to fit into the dis- ciplined, intellectualizing Olympian system. At best he could only be yoked to a Cybele or to Artemis, the goddess of wild beasts herself. Perhaps it was just such an abortive attempt of this sort, to impli- cate the five lions of the pediments with Athena. Below, on the metopes, there were more. Dinsmoor has identified a series of eight lions and leopards which served as metope decorations of the front fagade.8 The prototypes for these beasts seem to have been the pair of lion-panthers that flanked the Gorgon-Medusa on the pediments of the Temple of Artemis at Corcyra."9 Like those beasts, the Attic ones turn boldly en face. But, al- though the Corcyra pediments may have afforded the artistic inspiration, the ideological motivation for including these lions and leopards was Attic in origin: here again the goddess has shepherded the powers of nature, exotic ones perhaps, but still of the field, and curbed them to the defense of her house. One more theme decorated the Hekatompedon. The akroteria carried figures of the Gorgon and Perseus. Here again we have an echo of the major theme of the Corcyrean temple.'00 But where that edifice had ignored the Perseus and emphasized the demonic dominant power of the Gorgon by placing her at the center of the pediments, the Athena temple allowed her to flit at the peak of the front gable while pursued by the figure of Perseus at the apex of the rear.'01 Once again the forces of nature, but of aggressive and demonic power, which the Gorgons symbolized, are threat- ened and checked by one of at least semi-Olympian origin.102 Over and over again the Hekatompedon sculp- tures reiterate the same idea: the forces of nature, be they fertile and beneficent, or wild and threat- ening, all are either rent, subdued or harnessed by the intellectualizing, urban and Olympian forces represented by Athena and her champions Hera- kles and Perseus who are themselves at least par- tially of Olympian birth. It is in these terms that we can understand these theomachies between Athena and Poseidon, Athena and Zeus, for local supremacy at this particular time and place. They are not to be explained, it would seem to me, as Farnell and Harrison have done, at least not by so late a date as the 6th century, as struggles for power between new settlers and the aboriginal in- 97Lapalus, BCH 70 (1946) PP. 300-1; op.cit.

They are the preliminary indica- tions, on a popular level, of the contest Aischylos glorified a century later when he showed the de- velopment of the Erinyes to the Eumenides, the transition from uncontrolled, primitive aggression to powers of Olympian discretion. But the triumph which the Parthenon sculptures and Aischylos' Oresteia expressed in finished form the Hekatom- pedon displayed quite crudely and indirectly. The temple itself, erected about 566 B.c., with such expense, labor and certainly pride, quickly be- came obsolete; it was too small and too cumber- some with its row of columns down the center and its porch which was tristyle in antis.'05 Most out- moded of all must have been the sculptures. The severe and elegant taste of the Athenians of the early 5th century must have looked with embarrass- ment, if not boredom, at this, the mythological zoo of their grandfathers. It was undoubtedly with rare relief that by 490 B.c. the temple was demol- ished which a scant three score years before had been so important and so impressive. But such had been the growth of Attic intellect. THE BUCKINGHAM SCHOOL CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS 10o CAH III, ch. 23, 3, PP. 576ff. Farnell, Cults I, pp. 270ff., IV, pp. 47ff.
