<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Death of Emerson: Writing, Loss, and Divine Presence J. HEATH ATCHLEY Mount Holyoke College When I cruise the forty-three television channels available to me (and that's ba sic cable), simultaneously being enchanted and disgusted by much that I see (a kind of Kantian sublime), I cannot help but think that the culture in which I find myself is less articulate than ever. For this situation perhaps the 43rd President of the United States could serve as a useful emblem?a joke that is all too easy to make. But such a diagnosis of the low standard of my culture's literacy might also be too easy to make. For it is the case that America's traditional anti-intel lectualism reaches new heights in our current, hypermediated milieu: we now have more venues than ever to disseminate undisciplined, uncreative thought (think, for example, of all the burgeoning blogs). On the other hand, such hypermedia tion amounts to an explosion of symbolization. Language is everywhere, and hence there is the demand to use it instrumentally well. Again, an image from the U.S. presidency is emblematic. Think of President Clinton's infamous line to the intrepid Independent Counsel: "It depends on what your definition of the word 'is' is." Such a line could represent the pervasive urge to absolutely precise articulation, controlling one's words to an extreme degree. Another emblem could be the common academic paper where a writer has masterfully summarized and explained the words of another thinker, rendering them more accessible but prob ably not more desirable. One could read this situation dialectically: the moment when concern for the value of language seems lowest is also the moment when the demand for controlling language is highest. Beyond dialectics, however, I take the demand for absolute articulation as a jumping-off point for considering an idea that might appear to have nothing to do with this implicit yet persistent demand?the concept of presence. More specifically, I want to consider how a particular rendering of this concept affects what we might call the divine and its relationship to an ostensibly secular culture, and I also want to consider some lines from Emerson and how they can lead one to think of the divine as pres ence, a presence that requires an absence, a presence that to some extent is an absence. According to this encounter with Emerson, thinking about the presence and absence of the divine has to do with the way one takes up writing. Journal of Speculative Philosophy, Vol. 20, No. 4, 2006. Copyright ? 2006 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA. 251</page><page sequence="2">252 J. HEATH ATCHLEY *** How this essay itself takes up writing deserves some comment. First of all, the sentences here are intended to participate in the essay's argument rather than be solely vehicles for the delivery of that argument. Such a distinction might seem pedantic or overly refined, but I mean it to imply that the immanent qualities of the words (their sounds, arrangements, shapes, and connections to one another) embody a kind of importance that parallels the importance of a signifying mes sage. Not that philosophy should become literature, but a sharp awareness of its medium can give philosophy a power that pushes beyond the pedantic (something especially warranted in Anglophone academia). This push occurs, at least in part, because words themselves have some agency; that is to say, they are not only the instruments of a writer but also influences upon a writer; as words emerge they shape thinking as it is ongoing, as it moves into new territories of consciousness and reality. Along such lines, consider also how one can use the words of another thinker. One approach would be to build a consistent and authoritative picture of a thinker from her words. Another would be to allow the words to push one into compelling thoughts that might not otherwise occur, ones that might not even be recognizable by the source of their inspiration (or by oneself or one's own col leagues). I prefer this latter approach (though I am thankful the former exists), because it encourages contemporary philosophy to be moving instead of simply being informative or correct, something that has the potential to strike one dumb in addition to securing one's intelligence.1 Philosophy written in this manner cannot really strive to be appropriate to any particular standard or situation, but it might hope to be seductive to any given reader.2 *** Death can make one write and think differently. This sounds melodramatic. An anxious awareness of death is, of course, a mark of consciousness. But for some writers, some thinkers, death is an even closer companion than normal. Not only does it become a dancing partner, as Kierkegaard might say (1985, 8), but for such thinkers an awareness of death is the well from which their words emerge; it is a presence that influences the effect of one's language?a presence that marks their words with a difference. Dwelling on this point, think of the early work of Derrida. Writing is precisely that which disrupts presence, he argues in Of Grammatology, because writing severs the connection between a speaker and the receiver of speech. One way to imagine this situation is to see that there is nothing a writer can do to en sure the absolute meaning of what she has written; there is no way she can fully control the reception and interpretation of her lines. Once speech takes the form of a mark, it can function relatively independently from the will of its creator. In</page><page sequence="3">THE DEATH OF EMERSON 253 other words, writing by its nature indicates (and probably requires) the absence of the writer. Furthermore, writing does not fulfill its ostensible purpose?the delivery of a discrete meaning?because there is no meaning it can indicate that does not also lead to other additional meanings. (Derrida's favorite words for this process are dissemination and the neologism differdnce.) Hence, writing produces two kinds of absences: that of the writer (and her will) and that of a settling (and final) meaning. Does this way of seeing writing have anything to do with death? It does if we connect death with absence. But what of presence? Presence, in the way I want to think about it, concerns death?which is to say it is also about absence. The conventional way to think about presence is to see it as opposed to absence, as that which fills an emptiness. What is present is there\ it can be seen, touched, experienced. It is part of consciousness. What is present can be possessed and mastered. There is, however, another side to presence which Emerson's words suggest. Absence is not always the opposite of presence, not even a dialectical opposite. It is a presence all its own. For Emerson, this presence deserves to be called divine. *** Contrary to the normative teaching of the Christian Church?an institution he abandons at the age of twenty-nine?Emerson insists that divine revelation oc curs in the present: "the need was never greater of new revelation than now.... God is, not was" ("Divinity School Address," 21, 28).3 Revelation, however, does not happen in a historical-minded and doctrine-obsessed tradition. Emerson claims that vital religion actually occurs in the ruins of churches and historical religions.4 Such ruins serve as fertile ground for revelations not domesticated by the weight of history. Emerson thinks of revelation, however, in the very broadest of terms. For him, revelation is not about receiving any kind of message or dogma. Revelation involves presence: "When we have broken our god of tradition and ceased from our god of rhetoric, then may God fire the heart with his presence" ("The Over-Soul," 28). Typical Emersonian names for this sense of divinity are nature, god, soul, over-soul, and aboriginal self. (I will say more about this diverse nomenclature later.) In a manner that foreshadows Nietzsche's declaration that God is dead and Heidegger's diagnosis of the modern era as one stuck between the death of the old god and the birth of a new one, Emerson claims that we are in a period "when the old faiths which comforted nations... seem to have spent their force" ("Worship," 6). He suspects that the discrete traditions called faiths no longer work with the efficacy they possessed in previous times. The point is not entirely a sociological or demographic one. Emerson is not observing a mass exodus from churches. Rather, he sees conventional religion?more specifically the Christianity of the American status quo?as an unfulfilled idealism, a way of living in which no one seems really to live. The ideals of the various versions of Christianity have</page><page sequence="4">254 J- HEATH ATCHLEY less and less positive effect on ordinary life; religion happens only on Sundays. This is Emerson's diagnosis of the secular. His prognosis involves the suggestion that the secular (also called the ordinary) is just as sacred as the religious, that the line between the secular and the religious must blur if religion and culture are to be lively. Religion and revelation, for Emerson, occur in the meshes of culture. This is not to suggest that some kind of new tradition (complete with new doctrine) is established: "I confess, all attempts to project and establish a Cultus with new rites and forms, seem to me vain. Faith makes us, and not we it" ("Divinity School Address," 34). Formulating a new religion, as something discrete that creates the possibility for a new identity, is a vain and voluntaristic endeavor. Hence, Emerson's thinking is not a founding but an opening. He claims that religion is the flower of culture and that humanity is always in a state of culture.5 The sum of human creative activities is culture, and the flowers of those activities is reli gion. Thus religion in its revelatory state is going on all the time. It is a process that occurs through the ages and is not confined to a single one of the past. For Emerson, the vitality of religion exceeds the voluntary assent to beliefs derived from an overly historicized revelation. Religion happens. It is always happening. And it has to do with presence?not one that is the object of consciousness; this presence is also an absence. ** Divinity lies in the most unusual of places according to Emerson. In the essay "Experience," he writes: "Divinity is behind our failures and follies" (9). While a Protestant account of Christian grace will confess that human frailties are no ultimate hindrance to salvation, Emerson's statement implies a radical extension of the Protestant position: that divinity lurks behind such frailties, possibly as their cause. What kind of divinity could he be talking about? One that is immanent and frustrating. Emerson's divine does not lie somewhere outside of life, but neither does it secure life. Neither a comfort nor a source of safety, his sense of divinity is no friend to the self. An image that comes to mind is that of Yahweh and his Adversary making wagers over the fidelity of Job. Such a picture however, does not fit with one of Emerson's important concerns: joy. Though the divine provides no solace to the self, joy is fundamental to what could be called the religious, or thoughtful life. Take, for example, this passage also from "Experience": When I converse with a profound mind, or if at any time being alone I have good thoughts, I do not at once arrive at satisfactions, as when being thirsty, I drink water; or go to the fire, being cold; no! but I am at first apprised of my vicinity to a new and excellent region of life. By persisting to read or to think, this region gives further sign of itself, as it were in flashes of light, in sudden discoveries of its profound beauty and repose, as if the clouds that covered it parted at intervals and showed the approaching traveler the inland mountains,</page><page sequence="5">THE DEATH OF EMERSON 255 with the tranquil eternal meadows spread at their base, whereon flocks graze and shepherds pipe and dance. But every insight from this realm of thought is felt as initial, and promises a sequel. I do not make it; I arrive there, and behold what was there already. I make! O no! I clap my hands in an infantine joy and amazement before the first opening to me of this august magnificence, old with the love and homage of innumerable ages, young with the life of life, the sunbright Mecca of the desert. And what a future it opens! I feel a new heart beating with the love of the new beauty. I am ready to die out of nature and be born again into this new yet unapproachable America. (15) I venture the reading that what Emerson describes here is, to use one of his own words, a revelation. Something is dawning, approaching, appearing, being made known, or becoming (somewhat) present. Emerson names it America, new but unapproachable. I cannot ignore the fact that he mentions neither god nor religion. Hence, the troublesome secularity of the revelation. This America does not call for belief, that is, cognitive assent. Indeed, what is there to believe about it? There is no content to this revelation, no claims to facts, no testaments to ultimate reality. We could ask if it really happened, but what exactly is the "it" here? For such a question implies that what Emerson describes is an experience. His description, however, lacks such specificity. He gives no account of a particular experience. Instead, he appears to be characterizing a type or possibility of experience. In other words, he is generalizing. But it is still not clear that what he generalizes about is really an experience. Experiences normally have objects. One experiences this or that. No such discrete object exists here. Emerson's America is unapproachable and ungraspable; therefore it seems mistaken to call it an object of an experience. I will say more about this point shortly. Right now it is important to note the ef fect of the revelation: joy. (One could argue, counter to what I am saying here, that joy is the content of the revelation or the content of the possible experience it describes. I see no sure way of obstructing such a reading, except to say that it seems to me to make Emerson's thinking far less demanding.) The happiness for which Emerson is so known (sometimes infamously) boldly sits on display in the above lines, as if the hope for thought were to arrive at such a place. What could it mean that this America is not exactly satisfying, as water is to thirst or warmth is to cold? Also, why is it unapproachable? Emerson writes of flashes of light, profound beauty, and infantine joy. Such affirmative terms do not ostensibly suggest dissatisfaction or unattainabilty. Why the coyness? Further more, the context of the passage is puzzling. As a whole, the essay "Experience" approaches a tragic sensibility. It is a somber reflection on the ephemerality of life. Some scholars speak of it as a turning point in Emerson's career, from an optimistic, almost Hegelian idealism to a more tempered proto-pragmatism. Joy seems out of place in this writing. There are two possible clues to generating some interest out of this awk wardness. One, I have already mentioned, is Emerson's notion that divinity lies</page><page sequence="6">256 J- HEATH ATCHLEY behind our failures and follies. The other is the presence Emerson's dead son, Waldo. *** Another way of saying that divinity lies behind our failures and follies is to admit that what is called divine does not necessarily support or secure the self. It is not the fulfillment of our hopes, desires, or fantasies?even metaphysical ones. Divinity might not be concerned with salvation?at least not a salvation that preserves the rational, acquisitive subject. The divine in this view could be what is radically different from the self: the unrecognizable, a disturbance from elsewhere, a tear in complacent consciousness, an inassimilable presence. Is the divine in Emerson's view a terror?6 No, but neither is it a comfort. One name Emerson gives this sense of divinity is Nature. In Nature lies revelation, the kind of vibrant revelation now extinguished in the Church. Emerson's Nature, however, is not entirely pastoral. It is not merely the outdoors, wilderness, or even that essence called "human nature." Emerson avoids senti mentality by treating the concept philosophically. In his essay entitled "Nature," he writes: "Strictly speaking... all that is separate from us, all which Philosophy distinguishes as NOT ME, that is, both nature and art, all other men, and my own body, must be ranked under this name, NATURE" ("Nature," 4). Such an assertion seems aimed to avoid romantic pastoralism and the sentimental idealization of the outdoors. Nature is not only woods, mountains, pastures, and sunsets; it is what is not me, not the self, not consciousness. Nature is a presence, manifest in the wild outdoors, art, other people, and one's own body. But it is not simply these things, or these things gathered under one abstract category. Nature eludes the acquisition of the intellect. It cannot be a mere object of consciousness. If Nature is NOT ME, then it cannot be a clear and direct object for me, reflected as in a mirror. This implies that the self is not entirely in a state of control, epistemologi cally speaking, because, by this definition, Nature is what eludes clear and direct perception. In "Experience," Emerson makes the point this way: Nature does not like to be observed, and likes that we should be her fools and playmates. Direct strokes she never gave us power to make; all our blows glance, all our hits are accidents. Our relations to each other are oblique and casual. (4)7 Nature is wily and elusive to Emerson's eyes. Its presence is intimated, of course, but it escapes direct grasp. In this passage, Emerson makes Nature sound ca pricious and mildly cruel, almost to the point of anthropomorphism. Nature's elusiveness, at the very least, signals an indifference to human concerns. But he tempers this view when he reminds the reader that "Nature never wears a mean appearance" ("Nature," 6).</page><page sequence="7">THE DEATH OF EMERSON 257 One could accuse Emerson of seeming contradictory here, to which he would likely respond with a shrug.8 Nature wears no mean appearance in his vision, but it is also the general name given to that which prevents security in conscious ness. It is only from the perspective of the self, however, that the frustrations of Nature could be viewed as mean. To think of Nature as either a positive (pasto ral, comforting, romantic) force or a negative (destructive, frustrating, elusive, romantic) force is to cling to what is not Nature; that is, the self, a subjectivity that relates only to itself or its objects, a brittle core of personality that does not know its own transfiguration nor its own death. In a sense, Emerson wants to have it both ways: Nature is indeed inspiring and bedazzling, and it is overwhelming and elusive. His most famous lines convey this dual perspective: In the woods we return to reason and faith. There I can feel nothing can befall me in life,?no disgrace, no calamity (leaving me my eyes), which nature can not repair. Standing on the bare ground,?my head bathed in the blithe air and uplifted into infinite space,?all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eyeball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part and parcel of God. ("Nature," 8) These well-worn words are difficult to address with any philosophical sophisti cation. Emerson calmly expresses his feeling of safety in the woods. Nature can fix anything. The image of the transparent eyeball has become a staple of nature mysticism: in the midst of wild Nature, the self becomes one with being and god; differentiation, alienation, and struggle cease.9 Such a sentiment reeks of narcis sism and wish-fulfillment. How could one's identification with being and god be anything less? I suppose that my discomfort with Emerson's apparent monism stems from the attitude that such a philosophical position appears to project. That is to say, this monistic awareness can easily be read as a kind of solution to thinking, its point of rest, or destination. In other words the game is over when one has such an experience, and those of us who have yet to have this kind of experience (i.e., Emerson's readers) now have a new object of desire. But as with any diagnosis of Emerson's optimism or naivete, things are more complex if our reading dwells a bit. First of all, the transparent eyeball passage appears early in the essay "Na ture," which suggests that the passage is more a point of departure in the essay's thinking than its destination. Also, the essay itself, coming early in Emerson's career, is more the initiation than the fulfillment of the thinker's oeuvre. More important than these placements, however, are the logical struggles that the pas sage presents. If Nature is not me, and I become one with what is not me, is this not another way of saying that I am becoming not-myself? Is this not a challenge to identity rather than a grandiose confirmation of it? Any goal of self-assurance, then, would be a delusion. After all, a key line of the passage is: "I am nothing." In this experience Emerson reports?if indeed it ever was an experience?that all</page><page sequence="8">258 J- HEATH ATCHLEY mean egotism vanishes, but so does egotism altogether. The ego, consciousness, that which says "I," disappears. The "I" becomes nothing, an event that must surely bear some trauma. Could we not consider it a type of death?10 Perhaps so, but Emerson does not dwell on that metaphor here. The more dominant image is that of transparency, and this image produces an interpretive tension that Emerson does nothing to dispel. For even though he says the self becomes nothing and becomes one with being and god, the self is still an object to itself. It is a transparent eyeball. To say such a thing, the self must observe itself. To describe the self as transparent is not to suggest that subjectivity is lost or wiped away. Something transparent still exists; transparency is not absolute invisibility. If we think of the self becoming transparent, like a window, this suggests that its existence no longer gets in the way of the perception of other things. In other words, the image of transparency can be taken as an image of critique. Another way of saying this is that such transparency is a kind of diminish ment. It is precisely through the diminishment of the self that divinity appears, or, one might say, comes to presence. One way to describe this diminishment?one could call it the romantic or mystical description?is as a rapturous and unitive experience of Nature. Another way is to say that divinity lies behind our failures and follies. When the ego is unsuccessful, disrupted, disturbed, the divine emerges. God is a confusion. Emerson does not imply that there exists a deity who plots to frustrate mortals. Rather, he implies that divinity is the spirit that seeps through the cracks in human efforts to make life safe, secure, and predictable. Indeed, the essay "Experience" is an elaboration of these kinds of frus trations. It is a meditation on the contingencies and sufferings of existence, the ways in which the individual ego cannot comprehend or control life. Much of Emerson's reflections in this essay revolve around what could be called an exis tential epistemology. He dwells on the difficulty of adequately knowing reality in an ultimate sense and the anxiety that this difficulty brings. The question that begins the essay?"Where do we find ourselves?"?can be restated as "How can we know the ground upon which we stand?" Ultimately, we cannot, Emerson answers, because the ground beneath us moves: "Gladly we anchor, but the anchor age is quicksand" (8). The simple fact that things change, are always changing, means that knowledge is never final, never ultimate. Additionally, in a manner that resembles Hamlet, Emerson writes that existence is a dream, a surface, an illusion and a string of moods: Dream delivers us to dream, and there is no end to illusion. Life is a train of moods like a string of beads, and as we pass through them they prove to be many-colored lenses which paint the world their own hue, and each shows only what lies in its focus_We live amid surfaces, and the true art of life is to skate well on them. (5, 10)</page><page sequence="9">THE DEATH OF EMERSON 259 Where do we find ourselves? Amid surfaces, dreams, illusions, and an endless string of moods. Emerson also answers that we find ourselves in a middle region that we can only assume is a middle region because we do not know its begin ning or end: "We awake and find ourselves on a stair; there are stairs below us, which seem to have ascended; there are stairs above us, many a one, which go upward and out of sight" (1). Emerson paints a picture of experience as a mid dling ground with no appeal to a pristine beginning or promised land waiting in the future.11 The past and the future disappear into infinity. Again, the mood here is not despair; after all, Emerson says that one can skate well on these surfaces of life. But the mood is by no means triumphant. The self that skates well, Emerson implies, is tempered and transparent. It is as if Emerson's epistemological insight diminishes the grandiosity of the self, not in a way that is punishing, but one that is a release or an invitation. Finding oneself on a stair might also be finding a revelation, discerning divinity as presence. *** There is, however, an absence haunting Emerson's essay, one with a presence all its own: his dead son, Waldo. His father's namesake, Waldo died in 1842 at the age of five from scarlantina. Biographer Robert Richardson reports that the death "made a deep wound in the entire Emerson family, one that never completely healed" (1995, 359). The wound was especially severe for Emerson, who had lost his father at the age of eight, his first wife when he was twenty-eight, and his younger brother at the age of thirty-one. So Emerson's grief over Waldo's death is not surprising. What is surprising, however, is what he writes about that grief only two years later in "Experience": The only thing grief has taught me is how shallow it is. That, like all the rest, plays about the surface, and never introduces me into the reality, for contact with which we would even pay the costly price of sons and lovers. ... In the death of my son, now more than two years ago, I seem to have lost a beautiful estate,?no more. I cannot get it nearer to me. If tomorrow I should be informed of the bankruptcy of my principal debtors, the loss of my property would be a great inconvenience to me ... but it would leave me as it found me,?neither better nor worse. So it is with this calamity; it does not touch me. (3) Even veteran readers of Emerson are likely struck by the cold detachment of these lines. Grief is a shallow surface phenomenon that introduces one to no significant reality. Waldo's death does not touch Emerson, leaves him neither better nor worse. This disavowal of grief is contrary to the biographical facts: Emerson did indeed mourn Waldo for the rest of his own life. So why does the thinker ostensibly advocate this type of detachment in his essay? Sharon Cameron argues that, rather than being a disavowal of grief, the en tire essay is, in fact, a systematic representation of Emerson's grief. She notes how</page><page sequence="10">260 J. HEATH ATCHLEY Emerson briefly mentions Waldo only once in the essay. To her reading, however, the entire essay is permeated with the boy's death. In it, Emerson displaces that traumatic experience and places it at a remove. But he then reiterates the death by interrogating the larger concept of experience, acknowledging its ephemerality and the difficulty of securing reality by knowing it. Cameron writes: "we see that what appears to be a displacement from the subject of Waldo's death is no displacement at all. It is rather a reiteration of the child's death... for the only way the dead son can be recalled is in a delegatory way"(1986,29). Emerson delegates his mourn ing to his meditations on experience. This delegation is necessary because Waldo can no longer be experienced. Because he is absent, the only way adequately to experience him, one might say to make him present, is to acknowledge and affirm that life is a braiding of mood, illusion, and surface. In Cameron's words: "What is never said [in the essay] is that it is the son who can no longer be experienced. Instead of lingering on the enormity of that fact, Emerson deflects his attention to experience itself, specifically to that 'evanescence and lubricity of all objects which lets them slip through our fingers then when we grasp the hardest'" (28). She concludes that for Emerson to adequately experience Waldo's death, he must experience his own. This death is his affirmation of inevitable loss within experi ence, the ebb and flow of existence within perception. Cameron's reading of "Experience" is compelling. But I hesitate to claim that the riddle of Emerson's detachment has been solved. Indeed, from my per spective it has not. It is still unclear why Emerson advocates this type of detach ment. Why delegate the grief over Waldo? Furthermore, it is also not clear that his indirect representation of grief is systematic. To describe it as such suggests that his reflections are a little too planned, too deliberate. Emerson's thoughts on these matters seem to me more accidental than systematic, as if they clumsily vent forth out of a rupture, either Waldo's death or experience itself.12 Nevertheless, Waldo's presence throughout the essay cannot be denied. Even though the boy is not called by name, obliquely mentioning his death places him enigmatically throughout the writing. In some strange way, his presence requires not only his absence but also the absence of any direct memorial to him. The essay is not a eulogy, and Emerson seems to go to significant effort not to make it one. It is as if the father fears losing his son by memorializing him only in a representational way, by remembering him only as he was, by longing for the lost days of his health and vitality. Such a representation alone will not do for Emerson. Waldo's posthumous presence leads the typically optimistic philosopher to seek his com fort on a stair. There is little comfort in trying to preserve what is lost. But there might be some value to thinking on, to skating well on life's surfaces, to artfully participating in illusions. For even though "Experience" stands in marked contrast to much of Emerson's other work due to the essay's somber tone, he finishes it with the "unapproachable America" passage. He chooses to complete this pivotal piece with the strange image of a region that requires affirmation and delivers value but does not completely deliver itself.</page><page sequence="11">THE DEATH OF EMERSON 261 What Emerson describes as a "new and excellent region of life" (15) is one in which satisfaction is not the primary good. Entering into this region?in asmuch as it can be entered?is not like quenching a thirst or coming in out of the cold. Pain and suffering are not absent here, as Waldo's haunting presence attests. Nevertheless, it is characterized by an "infantine joy and amazement." This apparent paradox suggests that such joy and amazement do not depend upon satisfaction or the avoidance of suffering. Satisfying the self?one might also say securing the self?does not assure the value of life. Emerson suggests that such value emerges through the recognition and affirmation of transience?both the conventional understanding of transience as temporality (loss occurs through time) and what could be called an epistemological transience (knowledge is elusive because its "anchorage is quicksand" [8]). Far from satisfying or securing the self, this recognition disturbs the grandiosity of the human subject, its sense of entitlement, the desperate desire to be comfortable and the willingness to control or manipulate existence in order to be so. This new America is unapproachable. One comes into its vicinity but never absolutely enters it. Emerson also notes that it never totally reveals itself; through persistent reading and thinking the region gives signs of itself, as if it were a mountain covered by clouds that part only slightly at consistent intervals. If this America were approachable, or appropriable, it would become a source of comfort, a satisfaction that would drive the self back into itself rather than opening it to divinity.13 What Emerson calls divine, among other names he uses, is this event of self-diminishment: "I am nothing. ... I am part or parcel of God" (8). This diminishment, along with the failures and follies that accompany it, is paradoxical because it is intimately connected with the joy and amazement of this new region of life. But the joy and amazement of this new America are unapproachable: One cannot strive to become nothing or desire to fail in order to see the face of god. Instead, this new region where life seeps with value is something like a gift,14 a surprise that arrives from an intimate elsewhere, delivered as a presence that is always in some way absent. *** Presence, according to this reading of Emerson, is only presence. It cannot be the presence of any particular thing. Such a claim likely challenges the limits of good sense. What I am after, however, is a sense of the divine as something other than a determinate being or principle?something that consciousness can lay claim to and fight for. If the divine is a thing whose importance and beneficence rests on its self-presentation to human consciousness, then clearly we, or at least those of us who dwell in the secular, are bereft of such a being. It is not here, and we are left to make of the world what we can (or, all too often, what we want). If something divine were present, then the self would be sealed off in its own projections and representations of that thing?its own desires to do something with the thing</page><page sequence="12">262 J. HEATH ATCHLEY present. Are the spiritually inclined but secularly confined then limited to some version of the via negatival Perhaps so. Emerson, however, avoids the seduction of a simplistic negative theology by consistently generating a multitude of divine names?god, over-soul, aboriginal self, spirit, nature. Here is where Emerson's writing and his thoughts on writing, the point on which I began this essay, come into play. The divine names uttered and written by the New England Sage never settle into themselves, and he never appears interested in a single term for very long. This stems from what he thinks writing (mostly called poetry) does. Names of the divine are the results of speech that exceeds narrow discipline, a speech produced when the self drops its control over words. Such names are not clear calculations on the nature of the divine. In his essay called "The Poet," Emerson writes: "The poet knows that he speaks adequately, then, only when he speaks somewhat wildly, or 'with the flower of the mind'; not with the intellect, used as an organ, but with the intellect released from all service" (19). Hence, the writing that opens to presence is not descrip tive; there is nothing for it to describe separate from its own occurrence. Instead, it makes something happen. This event engendered of writing Emerson describes as a kind of seeing or attention. Writing that lets go of itself leads to a perception of nature. Already we have seen that nature is what is not self. Additionally, in what seems like a precursor to Nietzsche's affirmation of becoming and Bergson's notion of duree, Emerson in this essay thinks of nature (and god) as movement, a metamorphosis that does not stop: For, through that better perception, he [the poet] stands one step nearer to things, and sees the flowing or metamorphosis; perceives that thought is multiform; that within the form of every creature is a force impelling it to ascend into a higher form; and, following with his eyes the life, uses the forms which express that life, and so his speech flows with the flowing of nature." ("The Poet," 15) Thus, when nature and god are involved (these two terms consistently exchange places in Emerson's writing), no single name is good enough. It takes the process of naming, also called writing, an ongoing aspect of speech. This ongoing speech and the becoming that flows through it do not launch one into the heavens. Instead they stimulate a downward movement of attention. In other words, the perception cultivated by a writing released from will is nothing special; it leads to the noth ing special; it leads to a seeing of the common in which the common becomes valuable: "So the poet's habit of living should be set on a key so low and plain, that the common influences should delight him. His cheerfulness should be a gift of the sunlight; the air should suffice for his inspiration, and he should be tipsy with water" ("The Poet," 21). This ordinariness viewed as value I call presence; in Emerson's tongue, it might be called god, nature, or spirit.</page><page sequence="13">THE DEATH OF EMERSON 263 One might ask, what does such presence look like? In a certain way this question misses the point; for presence does not indicate the presence of an object, especially one deemed divine; there is no presence to show. Nevertheless, I am tempted to make an odd coupling between Emerson's words and the practice of contemporary Pop Art. Take, for instance, the following passage: Readers of poetry sees the factory-village, and the railway, and fancy that the poetry of the landscape is broken up by these; for these works of art are not consecrated in their reading; but the poet see them fall within the great Order not less than the bee-hive, or the spider's geometrical web. Nature adopts them very fast into her vital circles, and the gliding train of cars she loves like her own. ("The Poet," 14) Given the prevalence of nature in Emerson's rhetoric, it is easy to think that he advocates a sentimental embrace of an unsullied natural world, a mysticism of the woods (indeed that is exactly what the transparent eyeball passage in "Na ture" sounds like). So if we were to go looking for presence, we should take a hike. Such a move, of course, would put presence into an object that must be found, and it overlooks the connection Emerson draws between poetry (writing) and perception. Hence, in the above lines, it is not natural things that reveal the divine, but the way a poet sees that does so. With attention, even factories and railroads are consecrated. Does this attitude not give a compelling way of un derstanding something as distant (temporally and stylistically) from Emerson as Pop Art? One of the standard readings of Pop Art is that it reflects the inability to transcend the way capitalism commodifies all aspects of life. Everything is a product; everything is an image; and with this realization the only thing left to do is ironically announce the futility of escape. In this view Andy Warhol's silk screens of Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley are icons of kitsch that inevitably gain our veneration; the incessant repetition of his Brillo boxes and Campbell's soup cans reveal a web of "goods" from which we cannot untangle.15 Emerson's thinking implies, however, that untangling and escape might not be the key issues. When Warhol and other Pop artists take commodified objects and place them in a context in which they are seen, is this not an illustration of Emerson's idea of the ordinary as revelatory? If so, then an "example" of presence would merely entail the junk that surrounds us. No mountains, woods, canyons, or burning bushes needed (necessarily).16 *** Near the beginning of this somewhat circuitous essay I made the obvious claim that death has its effect on writing. What I have tried to make both implicit and explicit is my speculation that Emerson in some way is always dealing with deaths?death in the most literal sense of confronting one's mortality and the certain</page><page sequence="14">264 J. HEATH ATCHLEY loss of loved ones, and death in the less literal sense of affirming and adjusting to an existence that the human subject cannot control or predict, despite its best and worst efforts. My contention is that this confrontation with death (which I also refer to as absence and emptiness) makes possible a presence that beckons the designation divine. Emerson's writing and thinking reflect this confrontation. His writing is disjointed and disjunctive; it does not proceed through linear ar gumentation but, rather, draws the reader through an aphoristic spirit17 that is its own justification.18 Absence haunts Emerson's writing through a lack of clearly intentional, consistent, and non-contradictory arguments. From a certain perspec tive, it does not make sense?which leads me to think: The divine emerges as presence when we stop making so much sense. Notes 1. These comments about different ways of writing philosophy are inspired by Adam Phillips' thoughts on different modes of psychoanalytic writing. See Phillips (1993, 7). 2. Given these thoughts on this essay's writing, an academic reader might want to know that the essay is not intended to be a contribution to Emerson scholarship. Reading it will not likely elucidate Emerson in the way most secondary sources seek to elucidate their topics. Instead, I count the essay as testimony that Emerson's words can matter in contemporary philosophical conversations about the nature of religion, the secular, and the divine. 3. Because of the many published editions of Emerson's writing, I cite quotations by essay title and paragraph number. Similarly, I cite Whitman using title and section number below. 4. See "Worship," paragraph 3. 5. "Worship," paragraph 5. The irony here is that Emerson claims that instead of a new cultus there are the operations of culture. "Culture," of course derives from the word "cultus." 6. As I completed the previous sentence, I noticed that I inadvertently used the word "terror," needless to say, a provocative term these days, especially in the context of religion. If I may speak of a god of terror (as a type that inspires terrorism), such a divinity is likely to be comforting rather than terrible. Because wouldn't this kind of god promise otherworldly comfort to its followers who destroy themselves in its name? And wouldn't a god that promises otherworldly comfort for those who merely believe and love in an idealistic way be the twin of the god of terror? 7. Cf. Nietzsche (1966, 50): "Whatever is profound loves masks." 8. Cf. "let me remind the reader that I am only an experimenter. Do not set the least value on what I do, or the least discredit on what I do not, as if I pretended to settle anything as true or false. I unsettle all things" ("Circles," paragraph 27). Also, cf. Walt Whitman: "Do I contradict myself? / Very well then I contradict myself ("Song of Myself," section 51). 9. Emerson actually is critical of what he calls mysticism; he criticizes its tendency to fixate on religious language and symbols. See "The Poet," paragraph 25. 10. Along similar lines, Thomas A. Carlson (1999) argues that in premodern and postmodern traditions of negative theology there is a complicity, a quasi-identification, between death and God. 11. Along these lines, Yoder (1978, xv) argues that Emerson's new American Orphism does not so much involve a descent into supernatural depths as it does the consciousness of a "mid-world felicity." 12. Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe (1999, 18) renders the Latin etymology of "experience"?ex periri?as "a crossing through danger." Given this root, in addition to Emerson's writing on the matter, one can characterize experience itself as a type of rupturing. 13. It is a telling irony that Emerson chooses to name this region America because America has been mythologized as a promised land in numerous different ways, from John Withrop's "City on a hill," to Andrew Jackson's Manifest Destiny, to contemporary cyberutopianism born in Silicon Valley.</page><page sequence="15">THE DEATH OF EMERSON 265 Emerson's America is unapproachable and unpromised. It does not deliver itself. But it does make for the possibility of joy. 14. For an elaborate set of discussions on the complex nature of the concept of the gift and how it relates to religious thinking, see Caputo and Scanlon (1999). 15. Fredric Jameson's (1991,6-16) reading of Warhol's Diamond Dust Shoes is much along this line. 16. So one might wonder whether Emerson easily accepts the burgeoning industrialism of his culture. Surely he does not, because he puts such emphasis on nature as something divine and a continual metamorphosis. Both of these characteristics imply that nature slips beyond our grasp (both physically and epistemologically), and grasping the natural world is the core mechanism of industrialism. When Emerson claims that readers of poetry can consecrate even a factory village, one should sense that he resists the nostalgia that wishes capitalism would just go away. 17. Cf. Richardson (1990, 1). 18. Cf. Emerson: "Let us have nothing which is not its own evidence" ("Worship," paragraph 47. Works Cited Carlson, Thomas A. 1999.
