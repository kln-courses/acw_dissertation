Nous attendons de pouvoir relire Césaire dans une plénitude intérieure et créole. (Chamoiseau and Confiant 128) of the most prominent features of the literature of the French West Indies is its remarkably persistent, almost obsessive interest in the landscape, geography, and tropical environment of the islands. From the first "creole" (i.e. native-born) poets to the generation of writers and thinkers grouped around Aimé Césaire and the journal Tropiques, to the novels of Edouard Glissant, to the more recent work of the Groupe de la créolité, the physical environment of the region has provided some of the central themes of its literature. This in itself may not seem surprising, but what stands out is the unusually emphatic ideological role that the thematics of place have played in the post- colonial phase of Caribbean letters. Depictions of the landscape in this body of work tend not to function merely as scenic settings for narrative activity, or as aesthetic responses to the sheer physical beauty of the landscape, but to present the environment as an active agent in the drama of Caribbean history. A telling example of this post-colonial attitude towards the landscape can be found in Daniel Maximin' s novel Isolé soleil: Every time that you forget to describe tropical nature as a character in our history and not as its setting, a character with its own revolts and cowardice, every time you find yourself giving too many flowers to the gardeners and too many beaches to the clipper ships, then you will remember that lands where the weather is too beautiful are like maternal wombs hostile to rebirth. (Maximin 10) Tropical nature, it is suggested, should be understood not as setting, but as character, as an active participant in local history. This might seem at first glance to be a strange precept, but it has been a constant of the literature of the French Antilles in its post- colonial phase. One might cite as examples the environmental narratives of Edouard Glissant, such as La lézarde and Le quatrième siècle, where the protagonists are presented as literal personifications of the forces embodied by the rivers, plains, and mountains of Martinique's landscape. One thinks also of works like Jacques Roumain's Maîtres de la rosée, Simone Schwarz-Bart' s Pluie et vent sur Télumée miracle, Maryse Condé's Traversée de la mangrove, and Patrick Chamoiseau' s novels, which emphasize the importance of place as a source of collective identity, and the role of environmental factors in the shaping of individual personalities. In Chamoiseau' s Texaco, for example, the full cultural significance of the shantytown that lends its name to the novel only becomes clear when it is identified as part of the "urban mangrove" that surrounds Fort- de-France. This hybrid of city and country has value precisely because it manifests the will of its residents to maintain a vital link with nature that has been all but forgotten by the citified inhabitants of the en-ville of Fort-de-France. This post-colonial use of the landscape can be said to begin with Aimé Césaire's Cahier d'un retour au pays natal. The Cahier was among the first Caribbean texts to link landscape and identity in this overtly ideological, quasi-anthropomorphic manner and it provides an especially powerful use of the landscape as a symbol of personal and Dalhousie French Studies 55 (2001) -142-</page><page sequence="2">Césaire 143 collective identity. In recent years, however, Césaire' s work has come under fire for inadequately addressing the specific identitarian concerns of Caribbeans. This attack has been articulated most sharply by Raphaël Confiant and Patrick Chamoiseau in their literary history of the Antilles, Lettres créoles, as well as in their Éloge de la criolite (written with Jean Bernabé), and in Confiant' s vitriolic biography of Césaire, Aimé Césaire : une traversée paradoxale du siècle.1 Chamoiseau and Confiant do not doubt the immense talent or the good intentions of Césaire, who, as a poet and a statesman, had always sought to speak for his people by acting as "la bouche des malheurs qui n'ont point de bouche" (Césaire 1983:44). They reproach him, rather, with neglecting, or even actively repressing, the Creole component of Caribbean society in his poetic and political projects. They see him as a heroic figure, but one who, caught between his Eurocentric education and his Afrocentric theory of Négritude, was unable or unwilling to acknowledge the importance of the language and customs of Martinique's popular classes, which Chamoiseau and Confiant see as the only truly legitimate culture of the island. Battling to establish the aesthetic and ideological program of the Créolité movement, they fault Césaire for failing to work towards the development of a specifically Caribbean aesthetic free from the norms and expectations of European culture, on the one hand, and the Pan- African principles of Négritude, on the other. This polemical argument has been picked up by some academic critics who have called for a réévaluation of Césaire' s contribution to the constitution of a specifically Caribbean identity in light of this reproach. If, it is argued, a "true" or "authentic" Caribbean voice is one that speaks primarily to Caribbeans, then Césaire' s relative silence about the language and local customs of Martinique and the Antilles might be taken to undermine his claim to speak for them. Richard D. E. Burton, for example, adopts the line of Chamoiseau and Confiant almost to the letter: Séparé de la masse créolophone que pourtant il essaie de conduire à la Terre promise de l'autonomie régionale (jamais de l'indépendance intégrale), il n'arrive pas à s'arracher au monde du maître dont il manie la langue « comme il n'est pas aujourd'hui un Blanc pour la manier» et qu'il vilipende tout en restant politiquement et économiquement tributaire. (Burton 130) At the heart of this critique is the question of authenticity. What makes a text authentically Caribbean, in the view of the Creolists, is its vital link with Creole culture, and this determination leads them to oppose themselves to Césaire on almost every level, including the choice of linguistic ideal (Creole vs. French), the level of discourse (folk orality vs. erudite avant-gardism), the mode of representation (realism vs. epic), and the political program (quasi-nationalist regionalism vs. Marxist Pan-Africanism). The Creolists accuse Césaire' s work of being disconnected from the local reality of the Caribbean and, therefore, of little use in promoting a sense of local identity. They themselves, despite protestations to the contrary, have a tendency to focus so exclusively on the regional determinants of identity (ideolect, folk customs, etc.) that some have accused them of turning the rhetoric of authenticity into an isolationist tool (Maryse Condé makes this point powerfully). My aim in this article is neither to attempt a refutation of the Creolist critique of Césaire, nor to resolve this dichotomy between parochialism and elitist cosmopolitanism one way or the other (this is, after all, one of the great ongoing debates of post-colonial aesthetics), but rather to show how Césaire' s narrativization of the landscape seeks to negotiate this dichotomy. If, as the Creolists contend, it is necessary to reevaluate the significance of Césaire's work in light of the Creole contribution to Caribbean culture, then it is important to understand what elements 1.

I would like to thank Professor Kandé for her helpful suggestions on revising an earlier draft of this article.</page><page sequence="3">144 Eric Luis Prieto they have retained from his thought, as well as what they reject as obsolete or misguided. Chief among these is the mode of environmental symbolism developed by Césaire and the tendency to see the landscape as an active participant in the constitution of individual and group identities. Detailed analysis of this technique, in light of the concerns of the Creolists, will, I believe, help to understand why this specifically narrative use of the landscape has remained influential even as many of the doctrinal concerns of the Cahier, particularly those associated with Négritude, have appeared to lose much of their urgency. The Poetics of Place in the Cahier The project of the Cahier d'un retour au pays natal involves a quest for identity that takes place on three distinct levels: that of an individual search for self carried out in a phenomenological mode; of a search for Pan- African solidarity that results in the triumphal proclamation of the poet's Négritude; and of a proto-nationalist prophecy of Martinique's cultural and political autonomy that has strong revolutionary overtones. These three levels - the individual, the Pan-African, and the national - all converge in Césaire' s symbolic refiguring of the landscape of Martinique as "native land." Instead of inserting his protagonist into the landscape and observing it in the manner of the nineteenth-century nature poets, and instead of using the landscape in a realist manner, as setting, Césaire depicts the landscape as an animate being; it functions in the poem as a direct counterpart to his poetic persona: Au bout du petit matin, ce plus essentiel pays restitué à ma gourmandise, non de diffuse tendresse, mais la tourmentée concentration sensuelle du gras téton des mornes avec l'accidentel palmier comme son germe durci, la jouissance saccadée des torrents et depuis Trinité jusqu'à Grand-Rivière, la grand-lèche hystérique de la mer. (1983:38) The "morne," depicted here as a woman's breast, simultaneously conveys intimations of a baby suckling and of a cosmic copulation; it makes the poet a direct counterpart to the island, as lover and/or son. The proper names, Trinité and Grand-Rivière, make it clear that we are in the realm of the singular (these are real places on the island), but the sexual nature of the imagery and the term "essentiel" make it equally clear that desire and memory have transformed the place, making possible this fantasy of unity between the poet and the island. Some critics have a tendency to bracket the Martinican specificity of such images, intentionally or unintentionally downplaying their Caribbeanness in order to integrate them into more established, better understood cultural categories. Aliko Songolo, for example, sees in this type of imagery a specifically African relation to the world.2 Other critics tend to frame such images in a European aesthetic context, emphasizing, for example, the influence of the Surrealists on Césaire' s poetic technique (see Snyder, or Sartre). But it should not be forgotten that this image also belongs to a specifically Caribbean topos (in all senses of the word) linking the landscape to the theme of Martinique's history and culture. The "mornes," for example, are associated with the maroons, runaway slaves who would take up residence in the hills, making them bases of resistance. Similarly, the "grand-lèche hystérique de la mer" comports an implicit reference to the precarious cultural situation of the island, always at risk of being submerged by outside political and economic pressures. The force of Césaire' s landscape imagery derives not from the poet's powers of observation (i.e. Realism), nor from his ability to project his own concerns onto the landscape (as in Romanticism), but from his use of the landscape to explore the bonds, both affective and historical, that link place, 2. Cf. Songolo 19 and passim. Some of Abiola Ire le' s commentaries go in this direction as well (in Césaire 1994).</page><page sequence="4">Césaire 145 poet, and people, and to integrate that knowledge into compact, explosive images of exceptional beauty. Numerous examples from the poem could be adduced to support this claim, but it would be premature to form any definitive conclusions about Césaire' s contribution to Martinican or Caribbean identity on the basis of such images taken in isolation. For as Indira Karamcheti has argued: even as Césaire attempts to reappropriate the landscape for himself and his compatriots (to "decolonize" it by "de-exoticizing" it, as she says), he attempts to "remythologize" the landscape by endowing it with symbolic, spiritual content. In so doing he runs the risk of merely replacing the traditional exoticist images of his homeland, which he detests, with a new, but equally exoticizing mode of representation, to simply replace one form of exoticism by another.3 In order to understand how Césaire responds to this risk, it will be necessary to consider this kind of imagery within the larger narrative progression of the poem. The return voyage named in the title of the Cahier d'un retour au pays natal is a return to an authentic vision, to the native land that had been hidden by the assimilationist policies of colonial France. Césaire hopes to reveal the existence of a landscape "mille fois plus natal" (1983:44), to refigure the symbolic space of Martinique in order to uncover a truth that had, to be sure, been there all along, but had been hidden under generations of cognitive colonization. This process takes place in several stages. Most of the first part of the poem is devoted to an unblinking depiction of the town's degradation: filthy, poverty-struck, and above all inert, the town acts as a symbol of the moral prostration of the island's populace. This inertia is linked to the colonial attempt to impose a foreign logic onto the landscape. The town, "essoufflée sous son fardeau géométrique de croix éternellement recommençante" and "en rupture de faune et de flore," provides a clear example of the stifling effects of the colonial attempt to make Caribbean society conform to European models. The town alienates because it is itself alien: the product of an attempt to overpower the local environment rather than cooperate with it, it is "incapable de croître selon le suc de cette terre" (1983:34) The return home, then, requires leaving the city. The poet departs on a kind of world tour in space and time, invoking the history of the oppression of blacks and their struggle for freedom OToussaint, Toussaint Louverture"), while at the same time registering the imprint blacks have left on the modern landscape: "Et je me dis, Bordeaux et Nantes et Liverpool et New- York et San-Francisco / pas un bout de ce monde qui ne porte mon empreinte digitale" (1983:46). Upon his next return home, however, the poet is struck anew by the passive submissiveness of the inhabitants of his homeland, "ces quelques milliers de mortifères qui tournent en rond dans la calebasse d'une île" (1983:46), who appear to have forgotten their past ("ces pays sans stèle, ces chemins sans mémoire, ces vents sans tablettes" [1983:48]). The "mornes," reminders of the island's volcanic origin, hint at the possibility of a hidden revolutionary force, but they remain dormant, symbols of the island's unrealized potential. At this point, the poet decides that the island needs a spokesman, someone (like himself) to reinvigorate these symbols and make them potent. This determination calls forth the apocalyptic "cleansing" phase of the poem, where words become weapons capable of destroying the barriers that life under colonial rule has placed between the island and its inhabitants: Des mots? ah oui, des mots ! mais des mots de sang frais, des mots qui sont des raz-de-marée et des érésipèles 3. Karamcheti 184. See Suzanne Césaire for an example of the virulent opposition to exoticism shared by Césaire and the Tropiques group.</page><page sequence="5">146 Eric Luis Prieto des paludismes et des laves et des feux de brousse, et des flambées de chair et des flambées de villes. . . (1983:56) This passage, like the "morne" passage analyzed earlier, works polyvalently, using imagery borrowed from the natural world in order to link the transformation of individual identity to that of collective identity. To stress this dual function of his words, Césaire presents them as raining down on the island a variety of afflictions that alternate in strict fashion between corporal and environmental destruction: from fresh blood to tidal waves, from erysipelas and malarias to lava and brush fires, from blazes of flesh to blazes of cities. This passage allies the destructive force of the biblical plagues with the tropical specificity of the Antilles and helps to prepare the final transformation of the poem by metaphorically wiping clean both the geographical slate of the island and the psychological slate of its inhabitants. Nature, Négritude, and the Rhetoric of Authenticity It is Négritude that will furnish the spiritual tools for the regeneration of the island, and Négritude itself will be defined by being projected onto the landscape. Significantly however, in Césaire' s definition of Négritude, which makes up one of the poem's climactic passages, the Caribbean specificity of the landscape imagery disappears, to be replaced by more abstract, unlocalizable imagery. This subtle shiñ in Césaire' s treatment of the landscape provides important clues for understanding the role of Négritude within the poem. Négritude, as Césaire defines it, is like a tree, it takes root in the Earth with a phallic plunging that is opposed to the architectural achievements of technological civilizations: ma négritude n'est ni une tour ni une cathédrale elle plonge dans la chair rouge du sol elle plonge dans la chair ardente du ciel elle troue l'accablement opaque de sa droite patience (1983:68) Although the "red flesh of the soil" might be taken, as Abiola Irele suggests, as a precise reference to the red hue of Martinique's soil, it is clear that Césaire' s primary references in this passage are not so localizable. Césaire sets up his opposition between Négritude and European culture by opposing the former's espousal of the Earth to the technological achievements of Europe symbolized in the word "cathedral." Thus Négritude is aligned with [c]eux qui n'ont inventé ni la poudre ni la boussole ceux qui n'ont jamais su dompter ni la vapeur ni l'électricité ceux qui n'ont exploré ni les mers ni le ciel (1983:66) The achievements of European civilization can be enumerated in terms of technological advances (compass, steam, and electricity) and territorial conquest (via the seas and the sky), but the merits of Négritude must be sought elsewhere. This elsewhere, Césaire proclaims, is in the Earth itself, in the privileged bond, the passionate espousal of the soil, that Césaire posits for "those without whom the Earth would not be the Earth." This alignment of Négritude with the Earth constitutes one of the fundamental rhetorical moves of the poem, helping to explain why so much of the poem revolves around the opposition between town and country. By making this kind of rhetorical appeal to the solid, eternal values of the Earth, Césaire is able to claim the moral high ground for Négritude, opposing it to what he sees as the spiritual loss that comes with the single-minded quest for technological superiority. This shift in emphasis, however, creates rhetorical difficulties of its own. To the extent that the identification of Négritude</page><page sequence="6">Césaire 147 with Earth and nature helps Césaire to subvert the hierarchy implied by the technological and political dominance of Europe, it seems to make good rhetorical sense. But this type of monolithic identification of Négritude with nature could also be used to support just the kind of opposition between savagery and civilization that Europeans had invoked to justify colonization in the first place. Neither Césaire nor the cause of Négritude, it would seem, have much to gain from aligning themselves unqualifiedly with the savage, however noble, if that identification has already given rise to anthropological justifications of the "mission civilisatrice" and the "white man* s burden." Passages such as this help to explain why Sartre characterized Césairian Négritude as an "anti-racist racism," and why even those thinkers who owe the most to Césaire' s thought (including the proponents of Criolite), have been highly critical of the concept of Négritude. Any attempt to offer a categorical definition of an oppositional concept such as Négritude runs the risk of falling into the simplified polar oppositions characteristic of essentialist thought, regardless of the value, positive or negative, attached to the concept. Négritude is a universalizing concept, framing the private experience of the black individual in terms of a shared African ancestry. This, I believe, is why this passage names only abstract elemental entities, rather than invoking the specifically Caribbean imagery that runs through the rest of the poem: such a concept would lose its very raison d'être if it were linked to a specific place. These considerations bring us to the heart of the objections that Chamoiseau and Confiant raise regarding Césaire' s thought. If we limited analysis of the Cahier to passages such as this one, it would be easy to come away with the feeling that Césaire has left us with a singularly reductive, polarizing tool, one that is, moreover, difficult to reconcile with the multi-ethnic, hybridizing realities of contemporary Caribbean culture. It must be said, however, that the stark oppositions and abstract certitudes of this passage are unique in the poem. The Cahier is not, as Chamoiseau and Confiant would have us believe, simply a Négritude manifesto. To be sure, the historical and psychological importance of the Cahier* s resounding proclamation of the central tenet of Négritude doctrine - i.e. that it is "good and legitimate to be a Negro" - is undeniable, but this should not overshadow the thoroughly w/i-doctrinaire way Césaire works in the rest of the poem, which is fraught with tension between the collective memory of Africa and slavery, on the one hand, and the personal experience of a life lived between Paris and Martinique on the other.4 Indeed, it is not the above passage, but the numerous moments of self-doubt and hesitation that are most typical of the poem. The Cahier' s approach to the question of identity is too agonistic, too self-contradictory, too honest in its uncertainty about what constitutes an identity to be encapsulated in a label like Négritude. Unlike Chamoiseau and Confiant, who emphasize the question of authenticity and link it aggressively to the Creole specificity of Caribbean culture, Césaire' s Cahier tends to frame the discussion of identity in enigmatic terms, as a kind of riddle whose solution is to be sought in the relationship between the direct experience of the individual and the second-hand knowledge of history and myth. The point of intersection of these two kinds of knowledge is the landscape: Qui et quels nous sommes ? Admirable question ! 4. There is, of course, a politically committed Césaire, who allows the ideological imperatives of the struggle for racial equality to guide his writing into the less nuanced paths of l'écriture engagée. He appears most clearly in Césaire's theatrical pieces like Une tempête and La tragédie du roi Christophe and in such political pieces as the Discours sur le colonialisme. But if Césaire's stage and political oratory often has the simplifying tendency of propaganda, his poetry, and in particular the poetry of the Cahier, remains committed to a more open exploration of the relations between self, place, and polity.</page><page sequence="7">148 Eric Luis Prieto À force de regarder les arbres je suis devenu un arbre et mes longs pieds d'arbre ont creusé dans le sol de larges sacs à venin de hautes villes d'ossements à force de penser au Congo je suis devenu un Congo bruissant de forêts et de fleuves où le fouet claque comme un grand étendard l'étendard du prophète où l'eau fait likouala-likouala où l'éclair de la colère lance sa hache verdâtre et force les sangliers de la putréfaction dans la belle orée violente des narines. (1983:50) Césaire presents the entire passage as a response to a question, quoted indirectly. The words "admirable question" seem to mark an ironic reaction to a hostile query posed by a third party. The adversarial relationship implied by this passage, then, is clear: the speaker is responding to an aggressive interlocutor, placed somewhere outside the text. Indeed, one might imagine this passage as a reaction to an exchange of the following sort: Q: Who and what do you people think you are? A: Admirable question! (i.e. That's a better question than you think...) The question is introduced in the first-person plural (nous), but Césaire' s alter ego chooses to answer it in the singular (je). And although the question seems to have been intended as a taunt, the speaker quickly co-opts it, turning it to his own purposes by using it to reflect seriously on his own condition. The first part of his response takes a phenomenological tack: "À force de regarder les arbres je suis devenu un arbre." Like Sartre's Roquentin in front of his root, subject and object merge in the subject's gaze. Self-consciousness appears as consciousness of consciousness of the world. But in the second part of his answer, Césaire adopts a less self-reflective approach to the question. This time he focuses explicitly on the historico- political problems of colonialism and the slave trade: "à force de penser au Congo je suis devenu un Congo bruissant de forêts et de fleuves où le fouet claque comme un grand étendard." Here the transformation (je suis devenu) is catalyzed by historical thought which has the effect of, so to speak, "landscaping" the speaker: thinking of the Congo transforms the subject into a Congo and, what is more, a Congo where the colonial whip has not stopped cracking. There is a subtle chiasmic structure at work here: perceptual knowledge and historical knowledge are both in play, but they are at odds with each other. The verb that governs the first part of this passage (regarder, looking) is a non-reflective act of perception, and it results in what might be called a denaturing of nature: "et mes longs pieds d'arbre ont creusé dans le sol de larges sacs à venin de hautes villes d'ossements." Consciousness enters into nature (feet first), contaminating it with civilization, de- naturing it. On the other hand, the verb that governs the second part (penser: thinking) is a reflective verb. Here consciousness contains a nature that is already degraded, historicized. Césaire has not seen the Congo with his own eyes, but he knows its history. He thinks of it as a kind of nature (as forests and rivers), but one already contaminated by the history of colonial aggression. The circularity of this progression is clear: subject contemplates nature, denaturing it. Why? Because subject already has knowledge of a fallen (i.e. colonized) nature. The landscape acts here as the place where the subjective categories of individual perception meet the social categories of collective memory. Which, Césaire seems to ask, is a more important component of identity: the perceptual knowledge of a consciousness contemplating its surroundings, or the subject's knowledge of its historical, ancestral link to a past and a place of which it has no direct experience? Posed this way, of course, the</page><page sequence="8">Césaire 149 question is unanswerable, and Césaire does not attempt to choose between these two types of (self-)knowledge. He emphasizes instead the profound interdependence of these two categories. This becomes especially clear in the last line of this passage, where "l'éclair de la colère lance sa hache verdâtre et force les sangliers de la putréfaction dans la belle orée violente des narines." The agents of alienation, identified with wild boars (sangliers), are forcibly expelled through a passage that is at once a topographical border between forest and river (orée) and a corporal border between inside and outside (narine). This is what the landscape imagery of the Cahier allows Césaire to do: to question the borders between individual and collective identity by projecting them onto the landscape in terms that are at once personal/perceptual and historical/ideological. Implicit in this technique is the knowledge that identity depends on the interplay of self and other, on the ability to reconcile the private space of intimate experience with the public space of historical and ideological awareness. By making explicit the need to think through the interdependence of personal experience and collective memory, this passage also provides an implicit response to the challenge put forth by Chamoiseau and Confiant. What bothers the Creolists about Césaire' s work is the lack of any direct engagement with the popular culture and language of the islands. Césaire shows no interest in the conteurs, shopkeepers, and djobeurs that make up the cast of characters of the Creolists. But their very emphasis on such archetypal characters has a component of exoticism that risks backfiring on them. To quote Karamcheti again: "[W]hile this may be a description of quotidian Martinican ordinariness, it also summons up a landscape straight out of Western travel brochures" (186). Karamcheti is referring here to the Cahier, but her point applies just as well to the work of the Creolists: any emphasis on local specificity runs the risk of falling into the trap of tourist art, just as any emphasis on "local types" risks turning them into mere stereotypes. This is not to say that local specificity should be avoided, but that it is no guarantee of authenticity. Indeed, the whole issue of authenticity is a particularly problematic one in the Caribbean context, because, in the absence of any objective, or at least generally accepted determinants of authenticity, it tends to be defined according to the shifting, short-term priorities of personal predilection, self-interest, and ideological orientation. On this point Césaire may well show more sophistication than the Creolists: by suggesting in passages like the preceding one that he has not resolved the questions of identity and authenticity, but is trying rather to pose them as sharply and as pertinently as possible, he leaves the door open for subsequent developments. He sees himself as laying the foundations for an ongoing search for self, rather than trying to draw definitive (and enforceable) conclusions about what is and is not authentic. Conclusion: The Legacy of Césaire's Landscapes The evolution of the main stream of Francophone West-Indian cultural theory could be summed up like this: Césaire begins the process of breaking out of the racial hierarchies of the colonial system by promoting the Afrocentric values of Négritude as a tool for building an authentically Caribbean cultural identity. One generation later, Glissant, building on the achievements of Césaire, shifts the terms of the debate yet again by emphasizing, not the opposition between black and white forms of civilization, but cultural mixing itself as the distinguishing feature of Caribbean culture (Glissant 1972). Chamoiseau and the Creolists then use Glissant' s theory of métissage to back up their assertion that the profoundly hybrid culture of Creolity is not only the primary characteristic of West-Indian culture, but the sole determinant of authenticity there. This stance has since led to yet another dialectical reversal: Glissant, reacting against the position of the Creolists, has argued that it is not any given hybrid that can be deemed authentic or not, but the ongoing process of Creolization itself that confers authenticity (Glissant 1997:89 and passim). From black and white (Césaire) to a hybrid of black and</page><page sequence="9">150 Eric Luis Prieto white (Glissant), to hybridity itself (the Creolists), to the ongoing process of hybridization (Glissant again), West-Indian theories of identity continue to grow dialectically out of the foundations laid by Césaire, attenuating with each generation the role of race, but without ever managing to extricate themselves from it completely.5 It might even be possible to argue that it is precisely the hybridizing, ethnically heterogeneous character of West-Indian society that has made the landscape such an important theme in the literature of the region. Given the mixed cultural and ethnic heritage of the West Indies, combined with the almost complete decimation of the region's indigenous Arawak and Carib populations and the delegitimating legacy of slavery and the plantation system, it has been all but impossible to found a sense of Caribbean identity on the type of ancestral, historical, and filial bonds of originary kinship and rightful ownership that have traditionally been invoked in Africa and Europe as guarantors of cultural cohesion. With so many factors of division and so few elements of cohesion, it has been necessary to seek out a set of common denominators on which to found a sense of shared identity. Prime among these is the landscape, one of the very few features of life in the Antilles that is specific enough to the region to serve as a symbol of unity, while being shared by all groups, regardless of color, ancestry, socio-economic status, or education. Be that as it may, the dialectic of race and cultural identity, observed above, is mirrored in the type of landscape narrative favored by each successive generation. The landscape continues to serve as an anchor and explanatory tool for each new wave of cultural theorists, and to do so in ways that build demonstrably on Césaire' s symbolic opposition between city and nature. As we saw, Césaire opposes the city, seen as a symbol of alienation and European domination, to nature, which is allied with Négritude. Césaire' s (Marxist, revolutionary) theory of cultural change requires the total destruction of the city in order to allow a reemergence of nature and Négritude. A generation later, Edouard Glissant will also use the city as a symbol of alienation, but Glissant substitutes for the revolutionary, volcanic imagery of the Cahier a more properly evolutionary model. As one might expect from his use of such signature terms as métissage and créolisation, Glissant envisages a mode of cultural and social change that works through the gradual hybridization of city and country rather than the sudden annihilation of one by the other. Thus in La lézarde, Glissant' s protagonists seek, not the destruction of the political order of Lambrianne, but a symbolic mating {métissage) of the values of the city with those of the mountains. Glissant' s disciples in the Groupe de la créolité will share his emphasis on hybridity. But by making Creolity their ideal, they place their bet on an already achieved hybrid - they attempt, in a sense, to stop the dialectical progression set into motion by Césaire. Thus Chamoiseau's Texaco presents the Creole quartier as a form of urbanism that is more authentically Caribbean than any other because, like Creole culture in general, it has already succeeded in reconciling the environmental imperatives of the Caribbean islands with the European mode of urbanism characteristic of Martinique's en- villes. One understands why the Creolists would want to put an end to the uncomfortably vertiginous cultural spiral set in motion by Césaire. And yet, for all the appeal and vigor of the Creolist poetics of place (amply demonstrated in Chamoiseau's novels), one cannot help but suspect that, given the ever-evolving state of Caribbean culture, all such categorical affirmations of identity will be superseded in the next swing of the dialectical pendulum.
