NICHOLS1 I IN the fullness of time, 1894 to be exact, Henry Adams be- came president of the American Historical Association. The chief function of such an executive is to deliver an ad- dress at the Christmas gathering of historians, but in this particular year Adams was in Mexico. Therefore he com- municated with his colleagues by a letter designed to provoke discussion of a question which he held vital, namely, the ulti- mate character and purpose of history. His state of mind is revealed in a letter which he wrote somewhat later. In the chaotic and unintelligible condition in which I found - and left - the field of knowledge which is called History, I be- came over-poweringly conscious that any further pretence on my 1 The author of this paper is particularly under obligation to a number of scientists at Princeton University and at the University of Pennsylvania who discussed these matters with him at great length. They contributed greatly to his knowledge but they can not in any way be held accountable for the judgments of a layman. This paper was read at a meeting of the American Historical Association, at Washington, in December, 1934. 163</page><page sequence="2">164 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY part of acting as instructor would be something worse than hum- bug, unless I could clear my mind in regard to what I wanted to teach. As History stands, it is a sort of Chinese Play, without end and without lesson.2 As he told the association in his presidential letter, he thought history should be a science, a science which should be abso- lute and which should fix with mathematical certainty the path which human society must follow. The historian should seek the force, or forces, which actuate human society, map them out and thus discover their direction. This, he thought, could be done, and history be made, thereby, a centre of in- tellectual attention rather than remain only a tolerated play- thing. Because the direction of motion which history might discover would conflict, probably, with the interest of one or more great institutions, historians would find themselves sub- jected to pressure and professional martyrdom in order to force them to falsify the verdict. Adams was rather vague about the whole thing: he hinted at crises and left the impression that history ought to be an exact science but, that if it became so, it would be dangerous for the historians themselves.: In the years following this letter, Adams went on with his search for the great generalization. A yearning for the dis- covery of the ultimate force in the affairs of men long had been a stimulus to thought among the philosophical. Super- natural, or at best metaphysical, forces were those heretofore usually discovered. Fate, the gods, divine Providence, God, the Trinity, the Virgin, and the company of the saints were some of the supernatural forces in which was found the source of human action. Metaphysicians, especially those of the nine- teenth century, and notably Hegel, spoke and wrote of the universal spirit, the spirit of the age, the destiny of the race, the soul of a nation. Buckle, Comte, and Lamprecht had made 2 Henry Adams to Dr. J. Franklin Jameson, Washington, November 17, 1896. The author is indebted to Dr. Jameson for showing him this letter and giving him permission to use it. 8 This letter, dated December 12, 1894, is reprinted in Henry Adams, The Degradation of the Democratic Dogma (New York, 1919), 125-133-</page><page sequence="3">HENRY ADAMS ON HISTORY 165 much of scientific history and had written of the laws of society - in fact, they but echoed the eighteenth century in their confidence that reason would find the laws of all activity, both cosmic and human. Henry Adams himself was more in- fluenced, perhaps, by Darwin and Lyell but like the rest sought for the formula which would bring all history under a law as clear as the laws of physics seemed still to be in the latter part of the nineteenth century. The story of his quest, as he tells it in his autobiography * is both amusing and fascinating. The key to the whole prob- lem, he felt, was the relation of force to thought; therefore he must seek a dynamic interpretation. According to his descrip- tion, the search for such an interpretation started on its final stage in 1893 and came to an end in 1910o. During these years he made all sorts and kinds of experiments and formulated theories relating to various types of dynamics such as steam power, electricity and the dynamo, faith, women (abstractly, as a force), geology, relations of races, psychology, physics, and finally, radium. And what did he find? Unity, seemingly, had given place to complexity: a complexity of force exist- ing without direction. Amidst this chaos how could he meas- ure thought-motion and determine its direction? More and more as he explored did it appear that there were two conflicting dynamic theories which attempted to describe the direction of thought. The first of these was a law of evo- lution, or indefinite progress; the other a law of entropy, or ultimate degradation. Which was dominant? So impressed was he by the importance of the solution of this problem that he decided once more to come before the American Historical Association, again by letter, for he was a very shy man. Con- sequently, in the spring of 1910, some of the members of the association found in the mail a small book, signed by Henry Adams and entitled A Letter to American Teachers of History.5 4 The Education of Henry Adams: An Autobiography (Boston, 1918). 5 This letter bore the date of February 16, 19go, and can be found most conveniently in The Degradation of the Democratic Dogma, 137-263.</page><page sequence="4">166 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY In this letter he gave an elaborate demonstration which had brought him to an inevitable and somewhat startling conclu- sion. He was certain that the hypothesis of evolution not only had failed to be demonstrated but, on the contrary, had been overthrown by a discovery in physics. This was the second law of thermodynamics which, stated in Thomson's phrase, de- clared that " There is a universal tendency to the dissipation of mechanical energy: . . . any restoration of mechanical energy . . . is impossible; . . . within a finite period of time . .. the earth must . . . be unfit for the habitation of man." " Such a law destroyed the possibility of indefinite evo- lution; thermodynamics had terribly narrowed the universe. " Already," he told the teachers, " History and Sociology gasp for breath." 7 He therefore sought to awaken his colleagues to the impending doom and urged them to unite with the biolo- gist, the sociologist, and the psychologist in working out some common formula which would prepare society for its fate and as he phrased it " serve their students as a working model for their study of the vital energies." 8 This formula, he said, must be brought into accord with those of the physicists. It was absurd for social science to teach progress while physical science was committed to destruction. As far as can be dis- covered few of those who received this letter sought to join Adams in the search for the dynamic principle. As one who knew him said, " His appeal was quite premature." As a matter of fact, Adams had made a tentative formula- tion of his principle but he did not reveal it to the public. It was not until his autobiography had appeared in 1918, and his brother, Brooks Adams, had published The Degradation of the Democratic Dogma the following year, that it was pos- sible to learn what this was. It will be found in two chapters of the Autobiography and an essay in the Degradation as " A Dynamic Theory of History," " A Law of Acceleration," and 6 The Degradation of the Democratic Dogma, 141. 7 The Degradation of the Democratic Dogma, 261. 8 The Degradation of the Democratic Dogma, 262.</page><page sequence="5">HENRY ADAMS ON HISTORY 167 " The Rule of Phase Applied to History." Yet even here the dynamic interpretation of history is not very precisely formu- lated. Adams's studies of force led him to believe that thought followed its developments. The order of the appearance of the great forces conveniently corresponded to the order of their intensity. First, there was human reproductive energy as represented by women; second, faith, culminating in Chris- tianity; third, mechanical power; fourth, electricity; and fi- nally, radium. Each of these he considered more intense and more potent than the preceding, and each gave greater ac- celeration to thought. Each one he believed to be developed at a greater expense of energy than the preceding. Therefore he took two laws, Willard Gibbs's phase rule and the second law of thermodynamics, from which the phase rule is deduced, and with these he made his formula. Applying the phase rule, he discovered thought to be a homogenous mixture which passes through various equilibria just as water can be solid, liquid, or gas: ice, water, or vapor. Just as each chemical phase began and ended under some change of temperature or pressure, so thought changed its phase under some new or unusual force. Adams sought to prove that as thought was being accelerated, the succeeding phases were decreasing in length, by the law of inverse squares. The phase of thought in which faith had predominated, the re- ligious phase, had lasted ninety thousand years and ended about i6oo, when Copernicus and Galileo introduced the idea of mechanical causation. Then began the mechanical phase, which was three hundred years in length - the square root of ninety thousand. The third, or electrical, phase could last, by the same rule, but seventeen and a fraction years, i.e. /'3oo: from 1900 to 1917. His logical conclusion was a pre- diction that the final phase of thought would be brief, /17-5, or little more than four years; this would be the phase of pure thought, the ethereal phase, i.e. thought in terms of itself. By 1921, therefore, we should reach the limits of man's mental capacity. As each new phase, or equilibrium, had been ob-</page><page sequence="6">168 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY tained by a greater expenditure of energy, the natural results of the application of the second law of thermodynamics meant that entropy was growing with increasing speed, and that the final limit of thought and the final dissipation of energy were distressingly near. It was all to be summed up in an inevitable law of degradation. Such was Henry Adams's dynamic inter- pretation of history. On an anxious day in March, 1918, when the great German offensive seemed about to carry Adams's theory to a perfect climax, he died. Before discussing the validity of this theory, it is well to consider for a moment the personality of its author and the intellectual atmosphere of the day. Henry Adams had one very good reason, if not more, why the law of entropy should be instinctively attractive to him. He came of a distinguished family; his grandfather and great-grandfather had been presi- dents of the United States; his father had been a distinguished minister to Great Britain. He, in the fourth generation, was never to have the satisfaction of receiving even an invitation to a minor post. Here was a dissipation of energy. Besides it was a pessimistic period in thought; many other minds, some of them scientific, had been gripped by what were then con- sidered the valid philosophical implications of the second law of thermodynamics, and a moan of despair rose from certain classes of European intellectuals. The physicists felt particu- larly puzzled because radium had just recently been discov- ered, and its peculiarities seemed to upset the whole much- vaunted scheme of classical physics. Adams was, perhaps, a helpless child of circumstance rather than a wilful pessimist. II To-day the atmosphere of scientific thought is entirely dif- ferent. Since Henry Adams's day a veritable revolution in science has occurred. Planck, Einstein, Rutherford, Bohr, and others have been at work with amazing results. Since the close of the nineteenth century tendencies then already at work</page><page sequence="7">HENRY ADAMS ON HISTORY 169 have developed with unexpected consequences. In the brief space of forty years, the scientists' view of the universe has been transformed. The theory of relativity, the phenomena of radioactivity, and quantum mechanics have come to the fore.9 In the first place, the scientists' notion of law is now not a matter of universal acceptance but rather of widespread de- bate. The intensive studies of atomic structure which have culminated in the wave and quantum mechanics and the re- lated data concerning electrons, protons, neutrons, photons, and positrons have produced a series of attacks on the whole idea of determinism at its very roots, namely, in the processes of atomic physics. The units are not acting according to fixed laws but seem to exercise free will. Consequently there has been evolved a theory of indeterminism, the chief instance of which is the Heisenberg principle of uncertainty, which holds that laws are nothing more than statistics of probability. Such a conception of law is still in process of formulation, and its significance is a matter of much debate. In the second place, the structure and behavior of the uni- verse are being constantly demonstrated to be less anthropo- morphic, less understandable in terms of human experience. That is, men are turning from a visible to a non-visible uni- verse in which human imagination based upon sense impres- sion is no longer a possible guide to understanding. The universe is not built on the old principles of time and space, matter and motion, to be discovered by observation. Einstein has demonstrated the immaterial character of matter, and by his proof of the equivalence of mass and energy has developed 9 Titles of books which attempt to explain these changes in terms of the popular understanding are legion. The following have been selected at ran- dom: Albert Einstein, Relativity (New York, 192o); Max Planck, Eight Lec- tures on Theoretical Physics (New York, 1915); Max Planck, The Universe in the Light of Modern Physics (New York, 1931); Leopold Infeld, The World in Modern Science (London, 1934); Science for a New World, J. G. Crowther, Editor, (New York, 1934); James G. Crowther, Progress of Science (London, 1934); F. S. C. Northrop, Science and First Principles (New York, 1931); W. F. G. Swann, Architecture of the Universe (New York, 1934); Niels Bohr, Atomtheorie und Naturbeschreibung (Berlin, 1931).</page><page sequence="8">170 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY a concept which is certainly non-visible and which can be ex- pressed only in mathematics. Another aspect of the theory of relativity has been its em- phasis upon non-Euclidian geometry. Space is curved, abso- lute measurements are impossible because of the different velocities of the various bodies in space, and according to the principle of uncertainty, position and velocity can never be determined simultaneously with equal accuracy. The more accurately we determine the velocity, the less accurate is our knowledge of position. A corresponding law holds for the simultaneous determination of time and energy. All this breaks down the old conception of an observable universe of visible proportions and brings us to the point where scientists declare that only through the symbols and calculations of mathematics can we know anything of the microcosmos and macrocosmos. If we attempt to formulate physical concepts in non-mathematical and anthropomorphic terms, we destroy their purity. In other words, reason has gone beyond imagina- tion. Mathematical symbols, or Henry Adams's ethereal or final phase of thought, are the intellectual dominants. In the third place, knowledge of the character, amount, and behavior of energy in the universe has been greatly altered. Radioactivity, which startled Adams and the scientists at the dawn of the twentieth century, has been a fruitful field of exploration and has set man on a new quest: the liberation of energy in the atom. Einstein has discovered that mass can be transformed into energy, and vice versa. It has also been found that light elements, when bombarded with particles given off from radioactive substances or accelerated artificially with great power, are transformed into other elements. In this way energy stored up in the atom can be transformed into useful kinetic energy. To date, the efficiency of this process is ex- tremely limited, the machines which have to be built to pro- duce the required force for the bombardment are so gigantic and the amount of energy released so small that as yet it is not of much practical value. But if, as Sir James Jeans says, it be-</page><page sequence="9">HENRY ADAMS ON HISTORY 171 comes possible to transform the atoms of our earth into power, " mankind will be able to obtain practically unlimited power with almost no effort." 10 At the same time that the possibilities of a much greater fund of energy are being developed, science has gained a much clearer concept of the limits of the second law of thermodynamics, which disturbed Adams and the physicists of his day. As Planck describes it, some scientists attempted to formulate it so that it should "determine quite generally the direction of every process occurring in nature." 11 In reality, the law of entropy applies only to a closed system of force, where no introduction of new energy is possible. As one philosopher describes it, there is a tendency in the universe to overcome entropy, the running down of the second law is balanced by a corresponding running up; the law is but one aspect of a two-fold system. Then there are the mysterious cosmic rays, which seem to bring energy into the solar system, leading Millikan to believe that there is a process of re-charg- ing going on. Furthermore, the universe should have reached a state of maximum entropy ere this.12 Yet it still goes on, and some scientists believe that in the extraordinarily high tem- peratures of the centres of stars like the sun there is a trans- mutation of matter which continually produces additional energy. Some astronomers hold that the universe is in a state of alternate expansion and contraction. Finally, in spite of the second law, the probable life of the earth has now been calculated to be at least ten-fold what it was held to be at the time of Henry Adams. We now have perhaps a billion years allotted to us within which to worry about entropy. In reality, we can not begin seriously to calculate the rate of destruction until we know the sum-total of the energy to be destroyed. From that knowledge we seem to be very far away. The sec- ond law of thermodynamics has lost its terror. to Sir James Jeans, Living Philosophies (New York, 1931), 115- 11 Planck, Eight Lectures on Theoretical Physics, ii. 12 Leonard B.

Adams, Development of Physical Thought (New York, 1933), 242-</page><page sequence="10">172 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY Physics and history, in fact, are concerned with questions which are so far removed from each other in fundamentals as not to be reduceable to the same language. Even the term " dynamic " does not mean what we commonly mean - to the physicist it is not a force or power: it is merely a change of motion. Scientists object to having read into science pur- poses dictated by man's desires, and not warranted by the formulae. History deals with human conduct, the behavior of one species of organic matter, the human organism; physics is concerned with inorganic systems, the very elements of the uni- verse. Man, the subject of history, inhabits one small speck in a vast myriad of systems; physics sweeps through space, dealing with quantities so small and so large as to be quite remote from anything in the experience of man --except to those few gifted with mathematical perception. History deals with the events of human behavior for six thousand years, physics with cosmic cycles - with thousands of millions of years. Forces which operate in such inconceivably long periods of time (even were it to ultimate destruction) could have but little effect upon man's history in any length of time open to the consideration of the historian. Then what of Adams's theory? Force undoubtedly affects thought, and forces have been predominant generally in the sequence of Adams's phases, but that there is a definite cal- culable connection, such as is expressed in the phase rule of chemistry, or that there is an increase of entropy pointing to the end of thought or the destruction of the human species in any definite epoch is not now to be believed. Instead of loss of energy the thought of the last thirty years shows such vigor as to render possible a high degree of optimism. The synthetic power of Einstein and his associates has changed our horizon. III If we can obtain little aid and comfort from the physicists in our quest for a fundamental theory, must we give up the</page><page sequence="11">HENRY ADAMS ON HISTORY 173 search, must we turn our backs upon the scientist and seek refuge in metaphysics? This is what some of our foremost his- torical thinkers have done. Yet there is much still to be ob- tained from science. It may be postulated for the purposes of this discussion that there are two types of forces: the great forces of the inorganic world with which we have been deal- ing, and a series of forces much more vital from our point of view - namely, the forces that dominate the organic realm, the environment of the human organism. Learning little from the physicist, we may yet gain much from the biologist and psychologist. It may yet be possible to construct a new dy- namic theory which will be neither a law of progress nor a law of degradation. The chief focus of history is the behavior of man. Certain types of human activity, such as the development of institu- tions and ideas, have been extensively studied and described, but this specialization has formalized historical treatment of man to such a degree that the real scope of his activities and their explanation have been neglected; instead, flocks of ro- mantic ideas have flown about, quite fantastic to a true scien- tist. The treatment of human behavior by historians is gen- erally superficial and often misleading simply because of the prevailing ignorance of human dynamics. The dissipation of this ignorance entails fellowship not with the mathematical physicists who impressed Henry Adams but with scholars in the biological sciences. In biology and psychology there have been many advances in recent years, Several new ventures have arisen, such as cytology, biophysics and biochemistry, which are seeking to probe deeper into the structure of the organism and its be- havior. The centre of attention of the first group has been the cell, an absorbing object, for within it seems to dwell the secret of life and growth and decay. Intensive study of the in- fluences which seem to condition the evolution of a continu- ously more complicated structure points the way to hopes yet unrealized. If these scientists can find either the secret of</page><page sequence="12">174 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY growth or even methods of affecting and directing it, who can foretell the consequences? What a prospect for the protago- nists of planned economy? To be able to make blue-prints for cell alteration in mankind, for the regulation of sex, for the making to order of genius! Fantastic these statements may seem, but who knows? If these dreams should be realized even to a small degree, how would history then be written? The historian would do well to watch the cytologist. Next to the cell in importance comes the central nervous system. This has long been a focus for the attention of both biologist and psychologist. Great advances have been made recently in technique. The principles and methods of the study of dynamics in physics are being applied to biology, and we have departments of biophysics which have deeply im- pressed progressive scientific thinkers and patrons.'3 The heat and the nerve impulses of the body are being studied as the physicist studies thermodynamics and electrodynamics. The biophysicists find that nerve impulses are electro-chemical and can be measured, photographed, and counted. The activity of the brain can be recorded and its electrical energy can be transformed into light. Evidently every one of us is a dynamo, which produces a measurable electrical current. The body, moreover, produces heat in measurable quantities; it causes an expense of heat merely to keep a muscle in an organized condition capable of activity. Evidently there is direct con- nection between bodily energy and the forces of the inorganic world. In a recent article, the physicist Bohr questions whether there is any profound difference between the behavior of sense impression in the nerves and an electric current in a metal wire.'4 If physical measurement of bodily force can be de- veloped, one may yet be able to express human behavior in is Some suggestions of the interests of biophysicists are found in A.

And if so, may we not plot out conduct in such wise? If you wish your son to be an his- torian like yourself, you may in some future time be able to secure from the proper authority a mathematical scheme for his education. More practically, however, biophysics is study- ing the mechanism of pain and its measurement--in the hope of making possible more effective treatment of disease. Much more can be done with radium, x-rays, ultra-violet rays, and other forms of energy. The elimination of only a few of our most potent diseases would revolutionize history. The historian must watch the biophysicist. The biochemist, too, is persistent in his analysis of the chemical contents of bodily structure and especially of its se- cretions. With the medical world paying ever more attention to glandular activity, this phase of science has achieved great results. Much that used to be attributed to Providence or ill- luck is now found to be the result of over- or under-action of glands. Vitamins have been discovered, and many ills and wor- ries have been found to result from the lack of a balanced in- take of them. Experiments are now being made in correcting such deficiencies artificially. Extracts from glands are fed to pa- tients with marked effects, and vitamins are likewise supplied. It is now suggested in some quarters that by extensive diet directions and the feeding of certain chemicals the disposition of individuals and even communities and races might be changed. By proper feeding, some hold, the warlike might be made peaceful, the cantankerous, gentle - and so on. The modification of racial characteristics would have a tremen- dous effect on history. The biochemist will bear watching. The psychologists, too, have been having a field-day. Most significant has been their work in emotions and their studies of motivation. In this day of ballyhoo, advertising, and con- tinuous radio propaganda about everything from tooth-paste to politics, the extent of the power of suggestion is only just beginning to be imagined. The character of this great dynamic in human behavior is now the object of first concern to the</page><page sequence="14">176 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY psychologist. Numerous studies are being made to discover the relative importance in motivation of specific ideas, of emo- tions, and of the vegetative drives such as hunger and sex. This work should result in the destruction of many of our romantic notions of human behavior and revolutionize our explanations of human activity as heretofore formularized. Reason will be discounted and emotion exalted to a new sig- nificance. Much history will have to be re-written. In other words, if these various forces can .be isolated, meas- ured, analyzed, and directed, the future of the race may be? greatly altered. Historians, it may be objected, are not pri- marily interested in future behavior; why should they be con- cerned? A clearer and more accurate knowledge of the dy- namics of human behavior, however, may enable them to re- view the evidence of the past and find there new meaning and new significance. They can not, to be sure, raise the dead and measure their voltages or examine the functioning of their glands, but they may be able, from evidence available, more accurately to deduce the causes of behavior in the past. Such matters as diet, dress, plumbing and heating, social customs, health, medical practice, and similar matters about which there is much evidence, will take on new significance, and our understanding of the process of history will be reorganized. Egon Friedell, in his Cultural History of the Modern Age, has made certain suggestions looking toward a different approach. With adequate knowledge of this type of forces it may be possible to work out another dynamic theory. Such a theory will show how human organic force has reacted to the greater cosmic forces, the forces of the inorganic environment. It will show the course of the continuous adjustment made by man, not only of the forces which he has encountered, discovered, and in ever greater measure released, but also the adjustment of himself to these forces. The new biological and psychologi- cal knowledge may conceivably produce the formulae and the generalization which Henry Adams challenged historians to</page><page sequence="15">HENRY ADAMS ON HISTORY 177 discover. Such a new formulation will be neither a law of progress foretold by the Spencerians, nor will it be that law of degradation which impressed Adams. It may well be the law or laws of adaptation worked out in formulae of volts, ergs, and calories, based on the secret of the human potential. The principle of adaptation is one peculiarly fit to be used to interpret human history. Man seems to be the organism best fitted not only to adapt himself to his environment but to adapt his environment to himself. Adaptation is one of the primary concerns of life and can be made the unifying prin- ciple of historical evolution. If the laws of adaptation can be worked out scientifically, on a dynamic basis, that is, the laws of interaction of measurable forces, then we shall have the theory which Henry Adams considered necessary. History would no longer stand as a " Chinese Play, without end and without lesson." With this possibility in view, the historical guild may well give more heed to the probable contributions of science to our discipline. It should be a recognized part of our graduate training. Historians have long consorted with their brethren of the social sciences and to mutual advantage and stimulus, but the time has come, perhaps, to urge at least some of the neophytes to learn to handle new tools. Graduate students of history might well take courses in psychology and biology. We all realize, however, the present difficulties: much of the graduate work in the sciences is so highly specialized that it is beyond the historical student. But so, also, is much of the graduate offering in the social sciences. It would seem, there- fore, that either the undergraduate must be directed early toward the elementary courses in the scientific fields, or gen- eral courses in science must be worked out for graduate stu- dents in history. Such collateral work will not only give the historian a more realistic approach to his main task but will make him alive intellectually to the significance of these va- rious scientific revolutions as they burst into human con- sciousness.</page><page sequence="16">178 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY Henry Adams's challenge to teachers of history to seek a dynamic interpretation still stands, even though his own at- tempt to formulate it must be discarded. Historian and sci- entist may well work together - but they will work in a different direction from that pointed out by Adams. Possibly the immediate dynamics affecting human behavior, and the direction and acceleration of thought, will be found not in the stars but in the glands.</page></plain_text>
