<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND DISCUSSIONS Ctbartles cott fterrington: 1857=1952 On March 4, 1952, there ended quietly and peacefully one of the most remarkable scientific careers of our time. Sir Charles Sherrington was born in London on November 27, 1857, the son of James Sherrington, a country physician who practiced in Yarmouth in England. His father died when Charles and his two brothers were still in childhood, and they were brought up in the home of their stepfather, an Ipswich physician with wide interests. His brothers, William and George, subsequently became successful lawyers. Following a traditional English education, Charles was at first deeply interested in the classics. His introduction to science began only in 1880, when at the age of twenty-three years he entered Gonville and Caius Col- lege, Cambridge, to begin the study of medicine. There he was strongly influenced by two remarkable characters, Michael Foster, the father of Eng- lish physiology, and C. S. Roy, an adventurous and stimulating bacteriologist and pathologist. He was a contemporary of Henry Head, Mott, Charles Richet and Rivers, all of whom he knew well and admired. His path appears never to have crossed that of the neurological philosopher Hughlings Jack- son. While still a student, Sherrington made a brief histological report on the brain of a decorticate dog which had been exhibited by Goltz at the Inter- national Medical Congress of 1881. At the end of his preclinical training in Cambridge, having gained two scholarship awards in physiology, he spent the greater part of a year working with Professors Goltz and Ewald in Strasbourg. 'Following graduation in medicine in 1885, however, the pre- vailing enthusiasm for bacteriology claimed him for a time, and he ac- companied C. S. Roy to Spain as a member of a commission on cholera. Though cholera proved elusive, he discovered Ramon y Cajal and later introduced him to England and the rest of Europe. He later visited Italy, and the laboratories of Virchow and Koch in Berlin in 1886-1887, where he accomplished a brief study of leukocytosis by the classical method of Cohnheim. In the intervals between visits abroad he worked in the physi- ological laboratory in Cambridge and studied pathways in the spinal cord by Wallerian degeneration. On receiving the appointment of Lecturer in physiology to St. Thomas' Hospital in 1887, he returned to London. His earlier study of the chronic spinal dog with Goltz then reasserted its fascina- tion and he settled down to the methodical analysis of reflex behavior which he was to pursue for the remainder of his long life. It was characteristic of him that his first objective was to determine the plan of arrangement of the spinal nerve roots, devising methods of method- 474</page><page sequence="2">NOTES AND DISCUSSIONS ical isolation of each sensory root and each motor root, and recording their distribution by experiment. The reflex response in the spinal dog and monkey was useful for this purpose but was not alone employed. From the data thus obtained he turned to the study of reflex responses themselves, testing each of the current hypotheses then prevailing regarding reflex function. He immediately became aware of differences in the interaction of reflexes and set about the difficult task of unravelling these complexities. The publication of his first complete account of these researches in 1892 was recognized by his election to the Royal Society in 1893, and two years later he was called to the chair of physiology at Liverpool. Besides having a large teaching program and taking an active part in organizing the meetings of the Physiological Society and International Congresses, he continued steadily with his study of reflexes. A chance ob- servation of decerebrate rigidity in 1896 revealed a steady background of activity against which the inhibitory counterparts of reflex activation be- came apparent. The pattern of reciprocal innervation was established. The scratch reflex proved an ideal process with which to study the fractionation of reflexes, and the manner in which the 'local sign' of the afferent stimulus modified the motor response. The old conception of Bahnung, which he now called facilitation, was seen to be part of the mechanism by which natural stimuli effected an appropriate sequence of reflex behavior. In 1906 he gave a comprehensive account of his work and its significance in the understanding of nervous function, presenting it as the Silliman lectures in Yale University, which were published as the classical Integ- rative Action of the Nervous System the same year. Already there had appeared his excellent account of spinal reflexes and of general sensation in Schafer's Text-Book of Physiology in 1901, but the Integrative Action was different. In the remarkably lucid and logical development of the principles underlying the pattern of reflex responses of the spinal animal, there was now revealed not only an elegance of method but also a striking power of generalization. The influence of this book is quite remarkable. It was reprinted five times and reissued by the Physiological Society with a new foreword, curriculum vitae and bibliography of the author, in 1947. It is and will remain a classic of neurophysiology. It is of interest that the last chapter on "sensual fusion," concerning experiments on binocular flicker, examined the perceptual result of presenting conflicting stimulation to the two eyes. The resulting alternating rivalry for perception-first of one eye, then of the other, instead of the expected fusion of images-served to emphasize the oneness of awareness, as compared with the compromises effected by spinal reflexes. This was the last and only time that Sherrington 475</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND DISCUSSIONS experimented with subjective sensory phenomena. He never again departed from the motor system. "I may seem to stress the preoccupation of the brain with muscle. Can we stress too much that preoccupation when any path we trace in the brain leads directly or indirectly to muscle?" The chief problem was inhibition. In the following years Sherrington traced more closely the part played by inhibition in stepping, swallowing, and cortical reversal. In 1913, largely at the instigation of Osler, Sherring- ton was elected to the Wayneflete chair of Physiology at the University of Oxford. Competition for the appointment was strong, and J. S. Haldane and his pupils were at the time greatly disappointed. The honors course in physiology at Oxford, long inferior to the Cambridge tripos, now became eagerly sought after, and Sherrington himself began another productive period. The basis of decerebrate rigidity was shown to be the stretch reflex, and by an ingenious technique the adequate stimulus was traced to stretch of end-organs within the muscle itself. The isometric method of recording now enabled reflex effects to be quantitated, and the principles of occlusion and subliminal fringe of excitation were added to the already existing excitatory and inhibitory processes. A theoretical treatment of the fundamental prin- ciples, excitation and inhibition, produced the hypothesis of central excita- tory and inhibitory states and a general statement of their properties. Though rival electrical hypotheses have been propounded since that time, it is of interest that the recent work of Eccles with microelectrode techniques has resulted in a return to the hypothesis of C.E.S. and C.I.S. Sherrington retired from Oxford in 1936, a member of the Order of Merit (the highest British civil distinction), Nobel Laureate, Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and recipient of honorary degrees from twenty-two universities. Since that time electronic recording and microchemical techniques have opened a new and brilliant chapter in neurophysiology, but it is not to be supposed that the previous chapter is ended. Reflex behavior is the framework to which all must ultimately be related, and there is much yet to be learned by the classical methods. After retirement Sherrington returned to Ipswich to live quietly, but his eager spirit did not rest. He had long collected memorabilia and in- cunabula regarding the medieval philosopher Jean Fernal, who first intro- duced the word physiology. An invitation to deliver the Gifford Lectures in Edinburgh led to a discourse on mind and body, centered around the philosophy of Jean Fernel and the growth of physiology since his time. The published volume Man on His Nature is a classic, which many believe will outlive even the Integrative Action. In it Sherrington in his most elegant style delineates the physiology of perception, of reaction and of behavior, 476</page><page sequence="4">NOTES AND DISCUSSIONS and throws into strong contrast the properties of mind and thought. The clarity and originality of approach bring to this age-old philosophical prob- lem the same objective analysis that characterized the Integrative Action. The importance of this philosophical work is its objective examination of the physical aspects of mind in relation to the principles of nervous activity. The conclusion is that the two cannot be related by any of their known properties, yet are both the product of neuronal activity, but the definition of the problem by Sherrington at once rids it of the anthropomorphism and mystical properties with which earlier essays became confused. As Ekehorn has put it, the Sherrington view of mind takes it beyond the physical very much in the same way that the third or fourth dimension transcends simple planimetry; in neither case can the more complex condi- tion be entirely reduced to terms of the simpler and narrower one. Sherring- ton is ever mindful of the contribution of psychology, of the immense. amount to be learned of perception and of reaction to stimulus, but mind itself cannot be expressed by these data alone. The problem emerges in almost mathematical clarity, and perhaps mathematics will provide the ultimate solution. One cannot close this brief account without some mention of the man himself. His kindly, courteous ways endeared him to many generations of students and colleagues. Gentle in criticism, whole hearted in admiration and appreciation of the work of others, he embodied the intellectual and physical serenity which appears so characteristic of the Victorian era. He was an excellent raconteur, and his unfailing humor and vivid reminiscenses made his conversation a treasured delight. His poetry, published in a slender volume entitled The Assaying of Brabantius, is unpretentious but lyrical and has been widely praised. The blend of sensitive poet and scientific philosopher is remarkable, and his published essay on Goethe (Goethe on Nature and on Science, 1942) reveal his feeling for a kindred spirit. To the last his activity of mind was extraordinary, and in spite of painful rheumatic disability his tremendous courage of spirit and matchless integrity shone as a beacon light even to the age of ninety-four years. To psychology, neurology and physiology this was the true leader and the last of the mag- nificent Victorians. Harvard Medical School D. DENNY-BROWN 477</page></plain_text>
