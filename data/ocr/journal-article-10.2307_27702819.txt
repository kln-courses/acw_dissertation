<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HISTORICITY OF ARTHUR Cap. 56 of the Historia Brittonum1 begins thus: In illo tempore Saxones invalescebant in multitudine et crescebant in Brittannia. . . . tune Arthur pugnabat contra illos in illis diebus cum regibus Brittonum, sed ipse dux erat bellorum. Here, in ms. C, appear three late interpolations, inserted at different times and found in the following order: 1. et in omnibus bellis victor extitit. 2. Mab Uter (Britannice), filius horribilis (Latine), quoniam a puericia sua crudelis fuit. 3. Artur Latine translatum sonat ursum horribilem vel malleum ferreum, quo confringuntur mole leonum.2 The same series of inserta appears in ms. L, but in the order 1, 3, 2. Of the two etymologizing glossators, the first (hereafter called A) evidently took Uter as an adjective meaning 'horrible, cruel.' Cf. the Welsh uthr, which, if we follow Pedersen's etymology,3 originally meant 'admirable, marvellous,' but which, with a pejorative development, came to mean also 'horrible, cruel.'4 The second glossator (hereafter called B) gives two alternative etymologies for Artur. He seems to consider the name a metathetic or syncopated form of a com pound made up either of arth 'bear' and uthr in the sense 'hor rible' or else of arth 'hammer' (a variant of ord otherwise un recorded) and uthr in the sense 'cruel.' The etymologies, as such, are of course not to be taken seriously. They give us food for thought, however. In the first place, the variant arth 'hammer' of glossator B needs to be explained. Two words for 'hammer' appear in the British dialects: a native word ord (where d means (5) and a loan word morthwyl, morthol, morzol etc. from some variant of the Latin 1 ed. Mommsen p. 199. 2 Cf. Vulgate Psal. LVII 7 : Deus conteret dent?s eorum in ore ipsorum : molas leonum confringet Dominus; and note that Gildas ?23 speaks of the Saxons thus: turn erumpens grex catulorum de cubili leaenae (i.e., Germaniae) barbarae etc. (ed. Mommsen p. 38). 8 H. Pedersen, Vergleichende Grammatik der keltischen Sprachen I 93 with II44 and 660. But see A. Walde, Latein. etymol. W?rterbuch sv. paveo. 4 E. Lhuyd, Archaeologia Britannica sw. crudelis (p. 52) and horribilis (p. 66). 463</page><page sequence="2">464 Mahne martellus.5 The morth- for earlier marth- in the loan word came in by association with the native word. When a British speaker had occasion to say something about a hammer, both nouns might occur to him. He had to choose between them, of course, but the pronunciation of the noun chosen might be affected by that of its synonym, since both were "up" in his mind. Influence of this sort produces what is called contamination. Here the vowel of ord was substituted for the first vowel of its synonym, when that synonym was used. But obviously, if ord were used instead, it might be affected in the same way by its synonym, with ard or arth as the spoken product. And, if we may judge from our gloss, a form arth actually developed somewhere. Where? In Welsh and Breton the native word appears only as ord, with its descendants gordd, horz; in Cornish the native word is wanting altogether. The provenience of arth thus remains uncertain. Let us now turn to A's gloss. This clearly needs elucidation, for as it stands it is most peculiar. The natural interpretation of M ab Uter is 'son of Uther,' and this is doubtless what the epithet means, in spite of the glossator.6 Why did A reject this obvious explanation? He seems indeed to have heard stories about Arthur's enfances, and these were clearly of the usual type.7 But this alone would hardly account for his interpreta tion. In fact, we can make his gloss intelligible only by suppos ing that he did not distinguish two persons, Arthur and Uther, but looked on Uther simply as an epithet applicable to Arthur or as an alternative name for Arthur. If so, M ab Uther of course could not mean to A what it meant to the coiner of the expres sion and consequently the patronymic had to be explained away. But if Arthur and Uther actually were alternative names for the same person, the alternation is best explained on the assumption that the names were variant forms of the same word. And in fact we find in Welsh, alongside the adjective uthr, a derivative aruthr of precisely the same meaning. Could this 6 Pedersen op. cit. I 193 and 239 (where the suffix is discussed). 6 So also Greulich, Die Arthur s age . . . des Galfred von Monmouth p. 41 f. The point however was first made by J. Ritson, Life of King Arthur p. 54. 7 According to our glossator, Arthur was zfilius horribilis, that is to say, an enfant terrible. Cf. Grettissaga cap. XIV ff. (ed. Boer p. 38 ff.) and Egilssaga cap. XXXI, 5 and XL (ed. J?nsson p. 95 f. and 115 ff.).</page><page sequence="3">The Historicity of Arthur 465 derivative have developed to the form *arthur? Not in Welsh, certainly. In the other insular British dialect, however, viz., in Cornish, such a development would be possible enough, as we shall see presently. Furthermore, there is a considerable amount of literary and traditional material which connects both Arthur and Uther with Dumnonia.8 Thus, Uther's name is of Welsh origin (no equivalent of the adjective uthr exists in either Breton or Cornish), but the Uther legend, the preserva tion of which we owe to Geoffrey of Monmouth, is localized in Cornwall and bears every mark of Cornish origin, even the name of the hero appearing in a Cornish dress?the Welsh Uthyr would have given *Uthurus in Geoffrey; cf. his Elidurus for Elidyr (Mabinogion), Elidr (Tysilio). I hope to make plausible the hypothesis that Arthur underwent a parallel development, and that uthr and aruthr, in Wales synonymous adjectives and equivalent epithets applicable to the same figure, were imported into Dumnonia in the latter use and there suggested a differentiation of their owner into two figures, one for each epithet. First let us take up the matter from the grammatical side. The Welsh adjective aruthr (like uthr) has no Cornish equiva lent, but other words exist the history of which throws light on the development which a Welsh epithet *Aruthr might have had in Dumnonia. Thus, among the 9th cy. Smaragdus Glosses, which Loth has shown to be Cornish,9 appears cintil 'gentilis,' a word which d'Arbois de Jubainville identified with the kinethel of the 12th cy. Old Cornish Vocabulary;1? cf. also the 10th cy. Manumissions in the Bodmin Gospels, where appear the proper names Ongynepel and Wenceneftel.11 The word in question, like its equivalent the Welsh cenedl, was originally a dissyllabic oxytone (the / was not syllable-forming). How did its development proceed in Cornish? In both cintil and kinethel an anaptyctic vowel appears before the liquid, or, at any rate, a vowel originally anaptyctic. Furthermore, cintil shows 8 On Cornish tradition see especially F. Lot, in Romania XXX 1 ff. and J. Loth, Contributions ? V?tude des Romans de la Table Ronde, p. 60 ff. * Archiv f?r celt. Lex. Ill 249 ff., and R(evue) C(eltique) XXXV 215 f. 10 RC XXVII 152; but see Loth in Arch.}, celt. Lex. Ill 253. 11W. Stokes, in RC I 335 and 337.</page><page sequence="4">466 Mahne syncope of the old ultima vowel.12 No syncope could have occurred, of course, so long as this vowel retained its stress. We must assume a stress shift, then (in this word, certainly), by the end of the 9th cy. at the latest. And in fact we know that in both Welsh and Cornish the word-stress, at first fixed on the ultima, later shifted to the penult. It would thus seem that in Cornish the penultimate stress system was already in force at the time of the Smaragdus glosses. There is however another possibility. As early as the date of the glosses the anaptyctic vowel may have become a full vowel; if so, and if at that time the ultima stress system still prevailed, the new ultima would of course necessarily draw to itself the stress, and the new penult, by virtue of its loss of stress, would become capable of reduction by syncope of its vowel.13 Of course we need not choose between these alternatives. For us it is enough to record the fact that the shift took place, and to point out the syncope which fol lowed. The syncopated vowel however did not vanish without leaving a trace of its former presence. From it the svarabhakti 12 Loth loe. cit.) Loth points out that ardar 'plough' and tardar 'auger' show the same syncope; cf. Welsh aradr, taradr. 13 For the curious it may be noted that in general the old anaptyctic vowels of Cornish show no signs of ever having borne the word-stress; on the contrary, their leveling under e, though not carried completely through even as late as the Vocabulary, indicates plainly enough that they remained un stressed. Nor is the development in cintil parallel to that in Mod. Irish blogom (for bolgam) etc. Furthermore, Cornish early exhibits reduced vowels in the ultima, as the proper name Modred (Modredes) of the Manumissions (cf. the Modrot of the Cart, de Redon). And though Pedersen (cp. cit. I 279) hesitatingly explains the penult g (for e) in three or four Mod. Cornish words as a result of original lack of stress, in each case the preservation of the back round vowel is better explained as due to the influence of neighboring labials. I incline, then, to the opinion that the stress shift to the penult took place first, and that, later on, the svarabhakti vowel became syllabic. An effect of the second change was to make of kinethel a trisyllabic word stressed on the antepenult. But this stress was entirely out of harmony with the penultimate stress system then prevailing. Normalization could be effected in one of two ways : shift of stress to the new penult, or syncope of the penult (old ultima) vowel. And in fact some speakers used the one device, some the other, giving the extant doublets kinethel and cintil. Similarly, we find the doublets aradar and ardar. In most cases however one or the other of the two forms drove out its rival, so that only a single form is extant; thus, the syncopated in tardar&gt; the unsyncopated in banathel 'broom.' Cf. the English doublets a and an, m,y and mine, almost the sole survivors from a time when such doublets were numbered by the hundred.</page><page sequence="5">The Historicity of Arthur 467 vowel took its tamber. Thus, in cintil the new vowel has front tamber; in ardar, tardar, back tamber. That this tamber actually came from the syncopated vowel is shown by the unsyncopated forms kinethel, aradar. If, then, not only the Welsh epithet Uthr but also its equivalent *Aruthr came into use in Dumnonia, we may assume with some plausibility that by the end of the 9th cy., if not before, this had there developed to the form Arthur, a form strictly parallel to the cintil, ardar and tardar cited above. And just as in the case of Uther name and legend in their Cornish form made their way back to Wales and were recorded by Geoffrey the Welshman, so likewise in, the case of Arthur may name and legend in their Cornish form have made their way back to Wales, to be recorded (not without additions!) by the Welsh compilator of the Historia Britonum. Before proceeding further we must consider briefly another factor. In Ireland no less than in Dumnonia a Welsh aruthur would become *arthur. The following quotations from Peder sen14 will serve to show the nature of the phonetic development in Irish. Der Akzent liegt im Ir. in der Regel auf der ersten Silbe. . . . Die letzte Silbe bleibt immer verh?ltnism?ssig gut erhalten (vor allem verliert sie niemals ihren Vokal). . . . Der Vokal der urspr. zweiten und vierten Silbe schwindet im Irischen, wenn diese Silben Binnensilben sind. A good example of the Irish stress-shift and syncope in a loan-word is adraim 'ad?r?.' I assume that the Welsh aruthur would be taken over into Irish as a trisyllabic word (the anaptyctic vowel being imitated as a full vowel). If so, it would normally develop to the form *arthur. And in fact the earliest records of the name Arthur appear in Irish monuments, although in them the name is not brought into connexion with the king Arthur of pseudo-history, but appears attached to apparently historical persons of little consequence.15 Now Nennius, the editor of the definitive edition of the Historia Britonum, was of Irish origin,16 and presumably he would favor the Cornish rather than the native 14 op. cit. I 257 ff. 16 For the persons in question, with dates and bibliography, see J. D. Bruce, Evolution of Arthurian Romance I 6. 16 For the Irish connexions of Nennius see A. G. van Hamel sn. Nennius in Hoops's Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde.</page><page sequence="6">468 Mahne Welsh form of the name under discussion, because of its agree ment with the Irish form. At any rate the name appears as Arthur in Nennius's work.17 An etymology of Arthur very different from my own has been frequently suggested, and has been adopted, e.g., by Bruce.18 According to this etymology, the name is to be derived from the Latin proper name Artorius. It is quite true that Latin names came to be used to some extent in Britain. One may urge, however, that if Arthur were in truth a Romanized Briton, his failure to appear in Gildas, that violent partizan of the Roman faction, is all the more astonishing. But apart from any such considerations, the decisive point is one of method. It will not do to take the name Arthur in all isolation, and look for a pho netically possible etymology. We must consider the name in connexion with the entire body of Arthurian material. The etymology which fits in with this material is the etymology which we must adopt (provided, of course, that it is sound phonetically). The rest of this paper, then, will be devoted to an attempt to show that my etymology does fit in with the story of Arthur?indeed, that only through my etymology can that story be made intelligible. A number of questions now arise. In the first place, how would the Welsh pronounce such a form as Arthur? The answer is easy. Whatever the position of the Cornish stress, the Welsh stress would be on the ultima. For Welsh exhibits certain phenomena, in particular reduced vowels in the penult as against full vowels in the ultima, which make it clear that ultima stress maintained itself for a long time in that tongue. The shift to penult stress seems not to have taken place, indeed, until the 12th cy., or even later.19 The Welsh, then, would stress the ultima of Arthur, and the original tamber of the vowel would thus be preserved in Welsh usage. The same would apply to Continental usage, where, in the dialect of Vannes, ultima stress has maintained itself to the present day. The difference of the final syllables of Uther and Arthur thus corresponds neatly to the fact that the former appears on the Welsh scene late, the latter early. 17 For Arthur as an import into Wales see Bruce op. cit. I p. 74 note 74. 18 op. cit. I 3 f. 19 J. M. Jones, A Welsh Grammar p. 48 f.</page><page sequence="7">The Historicity of Arthur 469 Secondly, before we have a right to identify Arthur and Uther we must establish or at any rate make plausible their original equivalence not only in name but also in nature, as shown by the attributes and activities of each, so far as records of these have survived to us. The French romances can be used here only with great caution, of course, since they embody a great deal of originally alien material which became attached to Arthur after Geoffrey had made Arthurian story fashionable. We have to depend for the most part, then, on the early chron icles and on the native Welsh tradition. Before we attack the problem on our own account, it may be well for us to note that Uther is generally looked upon as mythical; indeed, Rhys, with his theory of Uther as a "dark divinity," seems to hold the field. Arthur, on the other hand, is generally regarded as historical, although everyone admits that mythological material was early attached to his name; even Rhys felt it necessary to postulate, alongside his mythical Culture Hero, an historical Arthur with whom the Hero was fused.20 Our enquiry had best begin with the Uthyr of non-Gal fredian Welsh tradition. Our chief source of information here is the so-called Death-Song of Uthyr Pendragon, a poem of uncertain meaning and uncertain date, but of a content ad mittedly ancient and mythical.21 The first four lines of the poem apparently represent Uthyr as a storm god or demon, known by the epithet Gorlassar 'the blue' and belted with a rainbow. The noise of battle is here likened to a storm, it would seem, and the god of battle is the storm god, whose epithet is perhaps derived from the livid effect produced by the storm cloud. Cf. our English expression "a bolt from the blue." One is reminded 20 Rhys's arguments and conclusions are to be found in his Hibbert Lectures on . . . Celtic Heathendom and his Studies in the Arthurian Legend passim. He defines his "dark divinity" as follows (Studies p. 260): "The dark divinity is the god both of beginning and ending, of life and death; as the former he is the god of plenty, and as the latter he is the god of the departed, who adds to the number of his subjects by frequenting, among other places, the field of battle. He acquires therefore the character of a god of carnage." Rhys speaks of Uthyr likewise (Studies p. 9) as "the king of Hades, the realm whence all culture was fabled to have been derived." He seems, then, to regard Uthyr as in some sort a Culture Hero, like Arthur, or at any rate as a source of culture.? See also Greulich op. cit. p. 19 ff. 21 Printed in W. F. Skene's The Four Ancient Books of Wales II 203 f.</page><page sequence="8">470 Malone of the Germanic Woden, who in origin was a storm demon, conceived of as leading the host of dead souls in its wanderings through the air,22 but who through his rule over the dead came to be likewise a god of death, slaughter and battle. Indeed, the very names Uthyr 'the terrible one' and Woden 'the furious one' approach each other. Our poem goes on to speak of Uthyr as a dark prince equipped with baskets, a second Cawyl. The combination of darkness and baskets seems to indicate a god like Pluto, an underworld god of plenty or riches. Cf. the sack or bag of plenty of the chthonic Gaulish god Cernunnos. I take Cawyl to be the epithet appropriate to the basket god, i.e., to the god of plenty. Since however Uthyr calls himself a second Cawyl, it is to be presumed that his function as god of plenty is a secondary one, and that the chthonic sphere was not originally his. And in truth his expedition to Ireland (i.e., to Hades), as narrated by Geoffrey, hardly fits in with the conception of him as king of Hades. On the contrary, he is represented as robbing the king of Ireland of certain marvelous stones and bringing them back with him to Britain, where they were set up at Stonehenge. In my opinion Uther's invasion of Ireland is simply another version of the mythical invasion of Hades usually credited to Arthur, a version which serves to substantiate my identification of the two heroes.23 The development of Uthyr from plunderer to original possessor of the riches of Hades is not hard to understand, of course. And only by postulating such a development can we reconcile the contradiction pointed out above.?Woden too, in a famous old story, is represented as robbing the underworld of magic treasure. And, oddly enough. Woden accomplishes the task through his agent Loki, much as Uther accomplishes it through his agent Merlin. From the rest of the poem one would judge Uthyr to have been god of battle and slaughter, poetry and music, and magic and enchantment. Here again he resembles Woden, who had jurisdiction over all these matters. Uthyr appears too, like Woden, as world-father, and (if his gwas Mabon24 actually was? 22 K. Helm, Altgermanische Religions geschickte I 264. 23 For Arthur's visit to Hades see Rhys, Studies p. 10 ff. 24Skene op. cit. II 51 top; cf. Rhys, Lectures p. 20 ff. for the theory of Mabon's identity with Apollo Maponos, particularly p. 2?8 f.</page><page sequence="9">The Historicity of Arthur 471 in origin, a major divinity) as an over-god. Indeed, the resem blances between the two deities are so numerous and so striking that we should be justified in calling Uthyr a British Woden? without implying, of course, that any derivation was involved. And we might reasonably expect to find that on the Anglo British border Uthyr and Woden would now and then be identified or confused, because of their many common attri butes. For evidence of some such confusion see below. Our poem contains several obscure passages the elucidation of which is beyond my powers. Among others there is a refer ence to Arthur. This is immediately preceded by a reference to strife between Uthyr and the meibon Cawrnur. Now Arthur had difficulties in that quarter himself, as the Kadeir Teyrnon testifies (if gawrnur be the right reading).25 It seems likely therefore that the two references go together, and that both Arthur and Uthyr warred against the meibon Cawrnur. If so, we probably have a case parallel to the invasion of Hades already discussed, and to be explained in the same way, viz., as due to imperfect differentiation: when the heroes were differentiated the adventure, instead of being assigned definitely to the one or the other, was associated with both. This almost exhausts our list of early references to Uthyr (apart from Geoffrey's account). In a poem of the Book of Taliessin26 a certain Madawc, apparently a minstrel and juggler, is called mab Uthyr. It would seem that Madawc was so good an entertainer that he was spoken of as a son of Uthyr. The expression is not to be taken literally, of course: it empha sizes an aspect of the god likewise emphasized in the Death Song.27 The Hut Uthyr Pendragon 'illusion of Uthyr Pendragon' is referred to, in one of the triads, as among the three primary illusions of the island of Prydein.28 This puts Uthyr among the 26 Skene op. cit. II 155 (1. 3 from bottom) and 405. 26 No. XLI as printed by Skene op. cit. II 197. 27 Professor Loth writes (in a private letter) : "... un certain Madawc dont j'ai eu tort de faire avec Arthur un fils d'Uthyr Pendragon, dans une note." 2* No. XXV as printed by Skene op. cit. II 460 (1. 18 f.).?The Hut of this phrase might conceivably be taken, by mistake, as part of the hero's name, and in fact we find, in one ms. of Geoffrey, one case of this sort: instead of Uther Pendragon appears Hus Pendragon (the 5 for / is Cornish; cf bros 'aculeus' in the Vocabulary). But see Greulich op. cit. p. 22.</page><page sequence="10">472 Malone enchanters, of course, and confirms the evidence of the Death Song. Since however Uthyr learned his illusion of another,29 his function as enchanter seems to be of secondary growth; here too he resembles Woden, whose connection with the runes, certainly, was not original. The illusion in question was doubt less shape-shifting; at any rate, Geoffrey makes of Uthyr a shape-shifter. Again, since the proper title of the Death-Song is Marwnat Uthyr Pen, Rhys has identified Uthyr with Bran of the venerable head. But Uthyr Pen probably means 'the ter rible chief or 'Uthyr the chief and the Pen is meant to mark Uthyr as over-god (see above) or, in euhemeristic interpretation, as supreme ruler, set above the common run of kings. Certainly the expanded name Uthyr Pendragon must be so taken. The connexion with Bran the blessed is thus highly dubious. Let us now turn to Arthur. Here I shall begin by quoting from Loth:30 Dans les Traditions galloises, les po?sies, c'est un personnage souvent surnaturel; les propri?t?s de son ?p?e, de son manteau, rappellent celles de certains h?ros de l'?pop?e irlandaise. Il faudrait un volume pour r?unir tout ce qu'on trouve dans la litt?rature galloise seule sur ce h?ros de la race bretonne. S'il a r?ellement exist? ... la l?gende lui a, ? coup s?r, attribu? les traits de h?ros ou de demi-dieux plus anciens. I hope to show that these traits are most readily explicable on the hypothesis that Arthur was, in origin, a mythical figure, identical with Uther or an hypostasis of Uther. Rhys long ago made the dictum, "In Irish and Welsh literature, the great figures of Celtic mythology usually assume the character of kings of Britain and of the sister-island respectively, and most of the myths of the modern Celts are to be found manipulated so as to form the opening chapters of what has been usually regarded as the early history of the British Isles."31 This dictum is still generally accepted as a sound working basis in the study of early Celtic tradition, which has admittedly come down to us in euhemerized form. It seems unlikely that Arthur was an exception to the general rule, and I think we shall find that, in fact, his case was not exceptional.?The differentiation of one 29 As we find out from the Red Book version of the triad; see Loth, Les Mabinogion II 229. 30 op. cit. I 187 note. 81 Lectures p. 119 f.</page><page sequence="11">The Historicity of Arthur 473 god into two gods, father and son, is of course a familiar mytho logical phenomenon (witness Freyr and Fj?lnir) and offers no inherent difficulties. The Arthur of such poems as the Kadeir Teyrnon is clearly a slaughterer, a great fighter, and so agrees in function with the Uthyr of the Death-Song. His figure remains undefined, how ever, and already reminds us of the Arthur of the romances, who is content to leave most of the actual work to his followers, a method of operation frequently characteristic of gods, it is true, and so perhaps primitive. Much more indicative never theless is the part he plays in a curious passage in Gervase of Tilbury's Otia Imperialia:32 narrantibus nemorum custodibus, quas for?stanos vulgus nominat, se alternis diebus circa horam meridianam et in primo noctium contincinio sub pleniluno luna lucenta saepissime videre militum copiam venantium et canum et cornum strepitum, qui sciscitantibus se de societate et familia Arturi esse affirmant. Cf. the "Arthour knycht he raid on nycht, vitht gyltin spur and candil lycht" of the Complaynt of Scotland.*3 Now Woden, as we have seen, was, in origin, leader of the Wild Hunt, or Wild Host (i.e., host of dead souls), and when we find Arthur functioning in this very capacity we begin to suspect that there was something Woden-like about him and that his resemblance to Uthyr in this respect was not accidental. But it is time for us to turn back to the earliest reference to Arthur, viz., the passage from the Historia Brittonum quoted at the beginning of this paper. Here I take dux bellorum as the Latin equivalent of Pendragon. If so, the whole passage refers to the still undifferentiated hero, here called Arthur and represented as lending supernatural aid to the kings of the Britons. That the aid was supernatural appears plainly enough in the account of the twelfth battle: duodecimum fuit bellum in monte Badonis, in quo corruerunt in uno die nongenti sexaginta viri de uno ?mpetu Arthur; et nemo prostravit eos nisi ipse solus.34 And the image of the Virgin which Arthur 82II, ?12.

This the glossator of the Vatican ms. tries to rationalize by hinting that Arthur had worked himself up from a comparatively humble station by dint of sheer genius. But the truth is quite otherwise. The author of the Historia Brittonum of course did not conceive of Arthur as a god; the euhemeristic teaching which set in with Christianity must long since have reduced him to a hero. But the hero had the dimensions of a mythical being; he still possessed supernatural powers and he could not yet be lowered to the level of a mere king. Hence he is represented as dux bellorum and this goes well enough with the Uthyr of the Death-Song. As to the Arthur of the Mirabilia, the name of the boar Troynt or Troitzl is Cornish in form. Note in this connexion that Geoffrey calls Arthur aper Cornubiae (VIII, 1). Was Arthur, in the theriomorphic stage, a boar-god, and does the hunt go back to a practice of sacrificing to him his earthly embodiment? If so, the story of Anir gives us a striking anthropomorphic parallel. For this story seems to be remin iscent of human sacrifice, and the place of Anir's tomb was perhaps originally a cult center, where such sacrifices took 35 Cf. also the so-called Battle of the Standard between Stephen and the Scotch in 1138. 36 There is clearly nothing to hinder us from supposing that such a practice was continued into Christian times, the image of the Virgin (or the Cross) being substituted for the old idol, and the image-bearer doing duty for the god? losing his identity in favor of the god, indeed, with the lapse of time.?William of Malmesbury and Geoffrey of Monmouth rationalize this incident by attaching the image (as a kind of device only) to Arthur's arms and shield respectively. The latter location was doubtless suggested by the fact that the Welsh words for 'shoulder' and 'shield' are very like. 37 The latter is the correct form, though not the best reading. Cf. Loth op. cit. I 248 note 2.?According to the story of Kulhwch and Olwen, Arthur finally overcame the boar in Cornwall.</page><page sequence="13">The Historicity of Arthur 475 place. When it is said that Arthur killed and buried his own son, we may suppose that the god required the sacrifice of a human victim who had first been consecrated to him (and so was in some sort his embodiment or "son"). For parallels we need search no further than Christianity itself, the central feature of which is such a sacrifice of son to father; indeed, the Christian belief may have inspired the British practice. Finally, we find twice in the Mirabilia the expression Arthur miles iterri ble warrior.' Behind the phrase lie the same mythological ideas as those we have already found behind Arthur dux bellorum 'terrible head-dragon.' We now come to the question of the date, not so much of the Nennian or pseudo-Nennian compilation38 as of the Arthurian traditions which this compilation incorporates. Here we must begin with the twelfth battle assigned to Arthur, since this is the only event mentioned which we know to have an historical basis. Gildas speaks of it as the obsessio Badonici Montis.39 In the siege the Britons seem to have won a great victory: the author apparently attributes this victory to "unexpected help" from a source not specified. Now Lot's researches40 have made it clear that Gildas was born, and Badon fought, c. 500 A.D. The De Excidio however gives us no information as to the leader of the Britons on this occasion. Nor have we any reason to suppose that this leader was an historical Arthur. Indeed, so far as we have any evidence at all, it points to the conclusion that the British leader was a person otherwise of little consequence, or at any rate of an importance insufficient to effect the preservation of his name. For when we come to the next account of these events, that of Bede, we find the narrative supplied with the leaders' names so oddly missing in Gildas. Bede knows not only the names of the English leaders, Hengest and Horsa, but also the name of their British opponent, Vorti gern. Evidently he had good sources of information independent of Gildas, sources that probably took the form of glosses in his copy of the De Excidi?, though Nothelm may possibly have brought him a certain amount of oral Kentish tradition from 38 For such a discussion see W. W. Newell, in PMLA XX (1905) 622 ff. 39 ed. Mommsen p. 40. 40 La Vie de saint Gildas, in Melanges d'histoire bretonne p. 207 ff.; see especially p. 265 note 5. Cf. also Thurneysen in Zf cPh XIV 13 ff.</page><page sequence="14">476 Malone pre-Christian times in addition to the clerical material with which Bede credits him. Now if there had really existed a British leader identifiable in name and fame with the Arthur of Nennius, and if this Arthur had actually won so decisive a victory as that of Badon, one would expect Bede to supply us with his name even as he supplies us with the names of Hengest, Horsa and Vortigern. The failure of Arthur to appear in Bede indicates that Arthur's association with Badon was not original and, as late as Bede's day, was not generally (if at all) made. This brings us well into the 8th cy. When now we come to Nennius, we find the story of Badon radically transformed. Instead of obsessio we have bellum. Instead of a victory won through "unexpected help" we have a victory won through the unaided and supernatural efforts of a single person, and he a person not so much as mentioned either in Gildas or in Bede. Even the names do not quite agree: for Badonicus mons we have Mons Badonis. Evidently the author of the Historia Brittonum got his information, not primarily from Gildas or Bede, but from a popular tradition which had transformed the struggle into a mythical event. Now it takes time to effect such a transformation. Furthermore, no trace of the legend appears in Bede, in spite of that writer's manifest familiarity with sources of information mediately or immediately Celtic. I should therefore be inclined to set the beginning of the 9th cy. as the earliest plausible date for the tradition recorded in the Historia Brittonum. The historical germ out of which the mythical tradition grew is nevertheless to be found preserved in Gildas. According to the De Excidio the siege was won through "unexpected help" of a sort not specified. As time elapsed this unexpected help would gradually take on a supernatural tinge in the oral tradition, and would grow at the expense of the other details until nothing was left of these. Thus the demi-god or hero Arthur effected an entrance into the story of the battle and finally came to possess it altogether. And another factor may have played a part here. The Badonicus mons 'Badonic mount' was traditionally located in the region of Bath or Badon, and, since this was the region about which saint Gildas was best informed, there is no reason why the localization should not be accepted. But, according to a tradition pre</page><page sequence="15">The Historicity of Arthur 477 served in Godefroi's continuation of the Chorrete of Chr?tien, Bath was the seat of Melvas (Meleagant), the abductor of Guenevere. In the Chorrete Lancelot rescues Arthur's wife, but originally Arthur himself must have done the rescuing, and so he does in the Caradocan Vita Gildae, according to which Arthur besieged Melvas in his stronghold.41 The siege motif must be old. since it appears likewise in the parallel Irish marchen of Etain. It is likely, then, that in an earlier form the tradition used in the Chorrete included a siege of Bath by Arthur. If so, it is possible that the two sieges became confused at least to this extent, that the hero of the mythological one was made to play the leading part in the historical one as well.? It ought to be noted in this connexion that the name Melvas 'prince of the dead' is Cornish in form, and that even in Welsh the Cornish form of the name is the one ordinarily used.42 We have here an obvious parallel to the name-forms Uther and (if my etymology be accepted) Arthur.?As to the localization, Bath was apparently at first conceived of as an entrance to the realm of the dead; later, by rationalization, it became the seat of Melvas, the (euhemerized) mythical ruler of that realm. However it may be with the mythical siege of Bath, the evidence that we have points unmistakably to an historical siege of Mount Badon, at first unassociated with Arthur but later made into an Arthurian victory. The localization of this siege points to Dumnonia as the region where Arthur was first introduced into the account of the conflict. This fits in well, of course, with my etymology of the hero's name, an etymology which necessitates the assumption that the earliest stories attached to this name-form arose in Cornish-speaking territory. The name-form itself may have arisen at any time during the 8th and 9th centuries, a period when the phonetic conditions were favorable to its development; unfortunately we have no means of dating it more precisely. From the account in the Historia Brittonum it is clear that Arthur's name was also brought into connexion with what seems to have been a Welsh (rather than Cornish) list of 12 41 ed. Mommsen p. 109.?The stronghold however is here identified with Glastonbury. 42 Rhys, Studies p. 51; the etymology of Melvas here followed, however, is that of F. Lot (see Romania XXIV 327 ff).</page><page sequence="16">478 Malone traditional victories over the English. This list was prefixed to the account of the Badon victory, but the orthodox number of victories, viz., 12, was maintained. As a result, one battle had to be left out, of course. In practice, some of the mss. omit the 11th, others the 12th battle of the original (pre-Arthurian) list, while still others combine the two battles.43 One may suppose that the name-form Arthur and the Cornish stories attached to it spread north to Wales and were there adopted and supple mented (doubtless largely for reasons of euhemeristic conven ience). At the same time the very limited amount of Arthurian material in Nennius would indicate that the legend was then still in the early stages of its development. From this point of view we may date the Arthuriana of the Historia Brittonum (roughly enough) as of the 9th or 10th cy. My dating can readily be brought into agreement with other datings based on other criteria (all of which, I may point out, are more or less dubious). Ms. Harley 3859 includes not only the Historia Brittonum but also a collection of material which goes by the name Annales Cambriae. The compilator of these annals seems to have written in the latter half of the 10th cy., or at any rate not later than the end of that century.44 Two entries in the Annales concern us here. According to the first, Arthur, in the battle of Badon, bore the Cross of Christ on his shoulders three days and nights. Apart from the endurance feat, itself supernatural, this cross bearing is obviously a variant of the image-bearing attached to the eighth battle in Nennius. William of Malmesbury and Geoffrey of Monmouth agree with the Annales in associating the trait with the battle of Badon. And here it properly belongs, in my judgment, despite current critical opinion. The unex pected help mentioned in the De Excidio calls for just such a dramatic event as we find in this image story. We may fancy that the appearance of the sacred object put new heart into the Britons and resulted in a great slaughter of their foes, whence arose the story of Arthur's prowess in the battle. The transfer of the trait to Castle Guinnion in Nennius may safely be credited to a Welsh patriot. Certainly Nennius takes away from the uniqueness of the battle of Badon by making it simply the tail 43 For a different interpretation see A. Anscombe, in Zf cPh V 116. 44 See Loth, op. cit. II 203, on Phillimore's dating.</page><page sequence="17">The Historicity of Arthur 479 piece in a series of 12 victories. What more natural than to tone down still further the battle of Cornish tradition and to glorify at its expense one of the conflicts of the North?45 The other Arthurian entry in the Annales reads: Gueith Camlann in qua Arthur et Medraut corruerunt. So far as it goes, this entry tallies well enough with the story told by Geoffrey. The usual localization of Camlann46 indicates that the story of Arthur's last battle was of Cornish origin. Both the entries in the Annales Cambriae, then, seem to go back ultimately to Cornish tradition.?In this connexion ought to be mentioned the Arthur of the second Harleian genealogy.47 The appearance of Arthur here reminds one of the appearance of Woden in the Old English royal genealogies. The position of the name in the body of the pedigree can also be paralleled in the Old English records. Arthur's chronological position in the pedigree is that appropriate to a participant in the so-called second battle of Badon, i.e., the battle of 665 mentioned in the Annales Cambriae. One may conclude that the genealogist connected Arthur with that battle rather than with the Badon mentioned by Gildas; in other words, that as late as the time of the genealogist the Badon tradition was still essentially Cornish and was liable to inaccurate application in Wales. Finally, the pedigree indicates that at the time of its composition the differentiation of the euhemerized god into Arthur and Uther, son and father, had not been made or at any rate was not known to the genealogist: Arthur is given a certain Petr for father. It is of some interest to note that in non-Galfredian Welsh tradition Uther and Arthur seem mutually exclusive. They are nowhere related, whether as father and son or otherwise. This is best explained, I think, on the present hypothesis, viz., that the two names were originally equivalent epithets for the same person. One thus chose between them, and such choice naturally involves exclusion of the epithet rejected. Later on, of course, differentiation would set in, but the relationship of father and son seems to have had its origin in Cornwall. 45 But see Fletcher, Arthurian Materials in the Chronicles p. 32 ff. 46 See, e.g., Lot, in Romania XXX 16 ff. 47 As printed by Loth, op. cit. II 305 ff. (cf. p. 313).</page><page sequence="18">480 Malone There is a good deal of further Arthurian matter independent of Geoffrey, notably the Kulhwch and Olwen, where Arthur is "un personnage de f?erie," as Loth puts it. For a discussion of the Kulhwch I refer the reader to my distinguished colleague.48 I shall confine myself here to certain points on which I have something new to offer. First let us look at the Arthur of the Caradocan Vita Gildae.A9 St. Gildas was a Pict by birth, as everyone knows. The hagiographer proceeds to equip him with no less than 23 brothers, all of whom (unlike Gildas) warred against Arthur. One in particular, Hueil by name, was an active raider. He was finally killed by Arthur, who then sought and obtained from Gildas forgiveness for his deed. The saint's charity is made all the more laudable by a systematic deprecia tion of Arthur, who is represented as rex rebellis (i.e., a king who unreasonably refuses to stay beaten?) and as tyrannus, while Hueil is made a person in great favor with the people, who seem even to expect his eventual accession to the throne. The hostility between Arthur and the brothers of Gildas clearly goes back to the historical raids which the Picts made into British territory. The British Woden, euhemerized or no, would natur ally be called upon for help under these conditions, and in later story would be thought of as the defender of Britain against these attacks. The bias of Caradoc may be explained in part by the fact that St. Gildas was a Pict; the hagiographer would naturally tend to side with his hero's people, and this all the more since in Caradoc's day the Picts were hardly longer distinguished rigidly from the Britons proper. But this is not a full explanation of the matter. Where did Caradoc get the notion that Arthur was a usurper? I fancy we have to do here with the remains of an ecclesiastical tradition of opposition to Arthur as an object of worship. He had no legitimate title to such worship, the Church would argue, and this objection would linger long, though evaded by the god's transformation into a hero. On this theory Caradoc reflects the last stages of the Church's hostility to Arthur, and such hostility is intelligible only on the assumption that the hero-worship recorded from the 12th cy. on had been preceded by worship of a rather different 48 J. Loth, Contributions p. 37 ff. 49 ed. Mommsen p. 108.</page><page sequence="19">The Historicity of Arthur 481 kind. The meagerness and lateness in date of the first references to Arthur and Uther obviously point in the same direction. A hero looked at askance by the Church would get short shrift at the hands of the average clerk. Certainly hostility to Arthur is not confined to the Vita Gildae. In the Vita Paterni we find this description: deambu labat quidam tirannus regiones altrinsecus, Arthur nomine. In the course of his wanderings he came to Padarn's cell, saw and coveted the saint's consecrated tunic, and asked for it. The saint replied: non habitu cujuslibet maligni hec tunica condigna est; sed habitu clericatus. Later Arthur returned in a fury, to take the tunic by force, but (at the saint's command) the earth swallowed the "tyrant" up to the chin, and he was able to escape from his humiliating position only by complete submission to God?and to Padarn. The fact of hostility between Arthur and the Church (in the person of the saint) is here patent. The nature of the dispute is also significant; both parties laid claim to a sacerdotal garment. I interpret the whole as a survival of a religious rivalry; Christianity versus Arthur-worship. Again, in the Vita Cadoci51 is told the story of a dispute between Cadoc and Arthur which was ended by an award of cattle to the latter. Arthur however insisted that the beasts have certain markings: verum discoloresaccipere voluit, scilicet in anteriori parte rubei, in posteriori vero candidi, coloris dis tinctas plurima tergiversatione gestivit. Cadoc however by working a series of miracles managed to avoid payment. Arthur's stipulation as to markings is explicable enough if we consider that these had religious significance; from time im memorial specific markings have been associated with beasts destined for consecration to gods. On any other hypothesis however Arthur's tactics are less easy to explain. To be empha sized here too is the triumph of the representative of Christian ity; on the present theory, Cadoc deprived the heathen god of the sacrificial offerings to which he was entitled, here in euhem eristic disguise as wergeld. Perhaps the most curious story of all however is that which tells of an adventure that befell Gundlei (or Gwynlliw), the 60 W. J. Rees, Lives of the Cambro British Saints, p. 193. hl ed. Rees (as'above) p. 48 ff.</page><page sequence="20">482 Malone father of Cadoc.52 Gundlei was being pursued by Brachan, whose daughter he was carrying off. Pursuer and pursued had reached a hill which marked the boundary between their respective kingdoms when Arthur and his two followers Kay and Bedevere came into view, sitting on the hill-top playing at dice.53 When Arthur saw what was forward, he first wanted to appropriate the maiden, but was dissuaded by his followers, whom he thereupon sent to enquire of the approaching warriors which of them was the lord of that kingdom (toward which the flight was moving). When he found that Gundlei was the lord in question, he took his part and put Brachan to rout. Gundlei kept his captive and married her. Here Arthur evidently functions as defender of the border. Since Gundlei's border was the one which was being crossed, Gundlei was the one entitled to his help. This automatism is readily explicable if we take into consideration the fact that for hundreds of years the Britons had been on the defensive. The conception of Arthur as defender of the realm, as guardian of the border, might in time make of him as automatic a figure as the keeper of the ford. Here certainly he opposes the invader without hesitation or question as to the rights of the case. Such auto matism however befits an offended deity much better than an historical champion. Indeed, it is at bottom wholly incompatible with humanity. True, a human being, under orders or under spells, may exhibit similar automatic responses. But neither condition obtains here; Arthur is not subordinate to Gundlei (or to anyone else) in any sense, and never can have been. The Arthur of this episode, then, is to be explained as a god degraded (under the influence of Christianity) to an automatic, but still independent position as supernatural defender of the border. For a similar conception cf. the Kadeir Teyrnon. Let us now turn our attention to the Vita Carantoci.M According to this work a certain Cato and Arthur reigned together in Dumnonia, living at Dun Draithov. The joint rule of the two princes, and their use of the same capital, strikes one as curious. Cato seems moreover to be the superior; his name is always given first, and when the saint and Arthur after their 52 ed. Rees p. 23 f. 63 The throws of the dice perhaps determined the fate of mortals in battle. 641 use here the text printed by Lot in Romania XXX 2 f.</page><page sequence="21">The Historicity of Arthur 483 serpentine adventure repair to court Cato receives them gra ciously as becomes a lord and master. This state of things is best explained on the supposition that Cato and Arthur were father and son. The conclusion is not so startling as it seems. When Arthur came to be felt as a human being his need of a father would become pressing. We are familiar with one solution of the problem: the epithet Uther, originally nothing more than an alternative form of Arthur, was seized upon and made into a special name, and out of the differentiation grew Uther and Arthur, father and son. But our hero was known by another epithet. Nennius calls him Arthur miles, which, in Cornish, would be Arthur Cadwur. Now there is no intrinsic reason why the epithet Cadwur might not be utilized for father naming purposes even as the epithet Uther was so utilized. And in fact a Cador appears in Geoffrey in a part best explained as originally paternal. But of that more anon. Here we are concerned with the name Cato or Cado (the dental was a d whatever the spelling). Lot has noted55 a certain king Cath ovius of Dumnonia who lived in the 8th cy. This king Lot identifies with the Cato of our Vita. In early times the king's name was something like *Cadui (cf. Welsh Cadwy). Now it is a peculiarity of Cornish that the second element of the diphthong ui tended to lose its characteristic quality in favor of that of the first element. By virtue of the process ui might become uw or wu, according to whether the first or the second element had the top of the syllable. In the former case we get (by dissimilation) ow as a final product; in the latter case, smoothing to o eventually took place. Hence the forms Cathov, Cado, Cato cited by Lot.56 The date of the smoothing is uncer tain, but note Geoffrey's Cador-as against the Cadwur of the Old Cornish Vocabulary.,57 In any case it is surely not overbold to conjecture that some patriotic Cornish poet or clerk made Arthur into the son of a Cornish king by dropping the r of Cadwur or Cador. The process was arbitrary, no doubt (though 56 In Romania XXX 11 note 4; cf. also p. 12 with notes. 56 For a different explanation see Pedersen op. cit. I 521. 57 Here the wu has a slightly different origin, of course.?The Galfredian form indicates that Geoffrey's Cornish is more advanced than that of the Vocabulary. The same may be said of Gorlois if that name means 'the very grey one,' i.e. 'the venerable one.' Cf. the 12th cy. hus in note 28 above.</page><page sequence="22">484 Malone far less so than the procedure of the Harleian genealogist), but the gain was great and the cost little! In this way, then, I think, Arthur Cador or Arthur son of Cador became Arthur son of Cado (Cato). In any case the association of Cato with Arthur is additional evidence that the latter had no historical connexion with the siege of Mount Badon c. 500 A.D. On the present theory, out of the two epithets attached to Arthur arose two fathers, viz., Cador and Uther. The former was tied to Cornwall by virtue of his identification with the historical Cornish king Cado. The Cornish origin of Uther pater seems equally well assured, in view of the Cornish form of the name and the Cornish localization of the birth story. It would appear, then, that two conflicting traditions as to the parentage of Arthur arose in Cornwall or at any rate were early known there, and that it was in Cornwall that the attempts to harmonize these traditions were made. How was the harmoniz ing to be effected? The situation is not uncommon in mythology. Heracles had two fathers: Amphitryon and Zeus. The problem of his paternity was solved by making Amphitryon the reputed, Zeus the true father. As the story goes, Zeus, taking the form of Amphitryon, visited Alcmene in her husband's absence and begot on her Heracles. We find a parallel tale in Geoffrey. It may be analyzed as follows: 1) Uther pays court to Igern, the wife of Gorlois duke of Cornwall.58 2) Gorlois, angered at this, withdraws from court and shuts up his wife, for safety, in Tintagel castle. He himself repairs, with his army, to Dimelioc castle, where he is besieged by Uther's forces. 3) During Gorlois's absence from Tintagel, Uther takes the form of Gorlois, visits Igern and begets on her Arthur. 4) Gorlois attacks Uther's forces but is defeated and slain. 5) Uther gives up Igern and retires to his army. 6) Later Uther returns to Tintagel in his proper form and forces Igern to marry him. 68 The origin of Gorlois will appear below. That the two dukes of Cornwall are doublets is a thesis first upheld by Greulich op. cit. 44 ff. Greulich makes it clear that Cador was the original, Gorlois the secondary figure. His arguments would be strengthened if with me he maintained the primitive identity of Uther and Arthur, the lords of the two duk?s.</page><page sequence="23">The Historicity of Arthur 485 Here traits 1, 3 and 5 agree substantially with the Greek myth. Traits 4 and 6 however are in total disagreement with it, and trait 2 includes a hostility between reputed and true fathers that is foreign to the Greek. The presence of traits 4 and 6 has the further effect of making pointless Uther's shape-shifting, while it reduces Gorlois to a reputed father in name only, whereas Amphitryon, it will be remembered, actually brings up Heracles as his own son. Geoffrey, then, by no means gives us the reputed father myth (hereafter abbreviated RF) in an original or consistent form. Furthermore, if we look at the Galfredian romance as a whole (instead of confining ourselves to the birth incident), we see that for the most part it goes back to a different solution of the problem of the hero's two fathers, a solution which made of the additional parent not a reputed but a foster-father. For our purposes the foster-father myth (here after abbreviated FF) is best exemplified in the Irish marchen of Etain, which may be outlined as follows:59 1) The fairy prince Dagda falls in love with the unnamed wife of the fairy Elcmair; she agrees to gratify his passion. 2) Dagda sends Elcmair off on a mission, and delays his return by putting magic hindrances in his way. 3) Meanwhile Dagda begets Oengus (or Mac Oc) on the wife of Elcmair. 4) Oengus is turned over to foster-parents, the fairy Mider and his wife Fuamnach, and Elcmair on his return finds nothing to suspect. 5) Oengus is brought up in ignorance of his parentage. 6) At the proper time he discovers who his parents are, and through the help of his two fathers (true and foster) he reduces his mother's husband Elcmair to submission, making Elcmair's domains his own. 7) Oengus becomes a suitor of Etain, the daughter of the fairy Ailill. Ailill rejects his suit (the rejection is rationalized, but is all the worse motivated for that). 8) Etain appears in the home of Mider, apparently as foster-daughter. 9) Oengus steals Etain from the home of Mider and keeps her in a cage. !I follow in the main the outline of L. C. Stern, in ZfcPh V 522 ff.; for an earlier comparison of Geoffrey and the marchen see Rhys Studies 25 ff.</page><page sequence="24">486 Malone 10) Oengus's deed estranges him from Mider. Eventually however the two meet to effect a reconciliation. In their absence Fuamnach steals Etain and by magic arts transforms her into a fly, which finally falls into the goblet of the wife of a certain king Etar. Etar's wife drinks the fly down, is made pregnant thereby and gives birth to a reincarnate Etain, who now goes as the daughter of Etar. Oengus kills Fuamnach. 11) Etain marries Eochaid king of Ireland. 12) Mider reappears, and after much maneuvering carries Etain off to his fairy mound. 13) Eochaid after a year's search finds the mound, lays siege to it and forces Mider to restore Etain to him. 14) To Eochaid and Etain is born a daughter, Etain III, the grandmother of Conaire king of Ireland. 15) On Conaire the fairies avenge his ancestor's destruction of Mider's stronghold. In comparing this curious marchen with Geoffrey's romance we had best begin by drawing up a table of corresponding characters, as follows: romance marchen Uther Dagda Gorlois Elcmair Igern Elcmair's wife Guenevere Etain Arthur Oengus (Mac Oc) and Eochaid Cador Mider as foster-father Modred Mider as rival lover The magicians Merlin and Fuamnach cannot be included in the table, of course, since they are incommensurable. The absence of Fuamnach from the romance had the effect of limiting Guenevere to one life, as against Etain's three incarna tions. Hence Arthur answers to both Oengus and Eochaid. That there were originally three Gueneveres however is made probable, as Rhys has pointed out, by "the fact that one of the Triads speaks of Arthur as the husband not of one wife called Gwenhwyvar, but of three wives bearing each that one and the same name."60 The elimination of the incarnation machinery, then, and the concentration of the long series of 60 Studies p. 35.</page><page sequence="25">The Historicity of Arthur 487 events within the limits of a single lifetime, is to be looked upon as another example of rationalization. The Elcmair of the Irish FF is a befooled husband, but not a reputed father: in this respect he differs from Geoffrey's Gorlois. We shall see, however, that Gorlois as reputed father is unoriginal, and that he goes back to a British FF in which he was simply a befooled husband like his Irish counterpart. Mider's double function in the marchen is peculiar, and cannot be original. To start with, Mider was doubtless simply the rival lover. His usurpation of the additional part of foster father probably came about somewhat as follows. The hero and the heroine in the primitive story had the same foster father. They fell in love with each other, but their common fostering put their.marriage under tabu. This tabu was AililPs true motive in rejecting Oengus's suit. The hero, though rejected, did not acquiesce in the situation, but carried off the heroine from the house of the foster-father, where she was then living. Thus difficulties arose between foster-father and foster son. The fact of these difficulties, and the further fact that the subject of them was the heroine, resulted in the identification of foster-father and rival lover in the Irish version, where however the original distinction survives in the reconciliation of Oengus with Mider, a trait incompatible with rivalry in love and thus pointing to an earlier form of the tale in which foster father and rival lover were different persons. No such develop ment took place in the British version, where foster-father and rival were kept quite distinct and the lovers' difficulties with their elders were disposed of by eliminating the common foster ing, a method which got rid of the tabu and made it possible for hero and hero??re to marry without parental objection. The concentration which the Galfredian account in particular shows is most strikingly exemplified in the story of the rape of Guenevere. The Vita Gildae attributed to Caradoc and the French romances, taken together, give us a version of the rape quite similar to that found in the Irish marchen. In both the hero recovers his wife. Geoffrey however combines this story with the "passing of Arthur" story, which originally was doubtless a kind of sequel to the rape much as is the Conair? story in the Irish version.61 Yet Geoffrey does hold the 61 For Modred and-Guenevere before Geoffrey, see Loth Mabin. II 223 ff.</page><page sequence="26">488 Malone two tales separate, after a fashion: Modred is defeated and loses Guenevere in his first battle with Arthur, and the second battle, that of Camlann, has no immediate connexion with the rape. We are now able to tackle more intelligently the problem of the evolution of Cador in British tradition. Here three stages may be distinguished. In the first stage there are conflicting reports as to the identity of the father of Arthur, but no birth myth has as yet arisen to harmonize these reports. Relics of this stage are the interpolations in Nennius and the Cato of the Carannog Vita. In the second stage we have two birth myths, both explaining away the double paternity but each doing it after its own fashion. One myth, RF, makes Cador the reputed father; the other, FF, makes him the foster-father. The third stage, represented in the version of Geoffrey, is an attempt to harmonize the two myths. We have no direct evidence of the actual existence of RF. The appearance of the shape-shifting motif in the Galfredian account, however, forces us to look for a reputed father, for this motif has no point or purpose except in connexion with such a father. There is an alternative, it is true. We may assume that Geoffrey or some predecessor deliberately inserted the shape shifting trait into FF, in spite of its total lack of point, simply because he happened to be acquainted with the device and liked it. I cannot deny the possibility of this. But after all, medieval writers as a class were not so illogical and unreasonable as some people seem to think. There are many inconsistencies in their narratives, but these inconsistencies are nearly always best explained from tradition, not from innovation. A medieval writer might well cling to a trait, even though it were incon sistent with his narrative as a whole, if that trait were handed down to him. He had great respect for "authorities." Hence when he combined two versions of the same story he usually failed to harmonize the accounts in the thoroughgoing fashion that a strict regard for logic (at the expense of tradition) would dictate. But this does not justify us in assuming that he had no feeling at all for logic or consistency. The existence of a foster-father myth in connexion with Arthur is amply attested in the French romances, of course. The original form of the myth can be determined by comparison</page><page sequence="27">The Historicity of Arthur 489 of the extant versions with the Irish parallel, the marchen of Etain. This marchen corresponds to Arthurian legend, as we have seen, not only in the birth-myth but also in the rape of Guenevere story. In fact, it gives us the mythical (as distin guished from the pseudo-historical) framework for the Arthur legend. It would thus appear that the prototype of the marchen was common Celtic property, that it was pre-Arthurian, and that it got attached to Arthur by virtue of the fact that it offered a solution for the problem of the two fathers of the hero. Now a peculiar feature of the marchen is the trait according to which hero and heroine have the same foster-father. This same trait must originally have appeared in the British version, but, as we have seen, that version eventually eliminated the common fostering. The elimination could proceed in two ways. The fostering could be confined to the hero, or to the heroine. Hence we should expect to find two British variants of FF, in which Cador was foster-father of Arthur and of Guenevere respectively. What do we actually find? According to Geoffrey, Cador was foster-father of Guenevere. As to the French romances, Arthur's foster-father seems to have borne the name Arthur in Robert de Borron.62 The later romances exhibit a variety of name-forms (Artus, Auctor, Ector, Arntor, Anthors, Anthor), all however explicable as corruptions of Robert's Arthur. How did Robert come to give the foster-father such a name? On the present theory the explanation is easy. Originally Cador was simply an Arthurian epithet, occurring in the phrase Arthur Cador 'Arthur the warrior.' When Cador became the foster-father of Arthur the old phrase Arthur Cador did not immediately go out of existence; it must have survived for a time by mere force of tradition. But in non-Celtic lands, certainly, the phrase would be misunderstood. Arthur Cador would be considered as the full form of the name of the foster father and Cador would thus come to be interpreted as a mere tag which served to distinguish the foster-father from his foster-son the Arthur par excellence. Besides, it must have been thought appropriate that foster-son was named after foster father. In this way the foster-father acquired the name Arthur. 82 Here I follow Bruce, Evolution of Arthurian Romance I 145 note 33, and H. O. Sommer, Vulgate Version of . . . Romances Index p. 9, note 1.</page><page sequence="28">490 Malone If Robert's name for the foster-father actually came into existence through a misinterpretation of the expression Arthur Cador, the foster-father's surname ought to be derivable from Cador much as his Christian name is derivable from Arthur. His full name occurs, as it happens, only once,63 where it appears as Authors de Cors. Here the surname Cors is, I think, a phonetic development of Cador. In Northern French, Cador, once borrowed, would presumably develop, first of all, to *Cahors&gt;*Caors.6* And in the Anglo-Norman dialect, at least, the pre-tonic a in hiatus may be lost.65 Cf. the parallel early loss of pretonic e.66 Now Robert de Borron, though apparently himself a Burgundian,67 doubtless got the proper name in question through Anglo-Norman. As for the de, cf. the name Dinas de Lidan in the Tristan story, properly Dinas Lidan. Our Authors de Cors, then, probably goes back to an original Arthur Cador. It is clear that we have to deal with two distinct varieties of FF. These may be distinguished as pre-G(alfredian) and non-G(alfredian), according to whether the original double fostering, was confined to heroine or hero. The question now arises, how was the upbringing of the hero to be accomplished in pre-G, now that no foster-father was available for the purpose. Geoffrey gives us the answer. The boy was brought up by his true father. But this involves slaughtering off almost at once Gorlois, the British equivalent of Elcmair, in order that true father and mother might be married and the hero's up bringing properly attended to. Hence the hero's father must dispossess Gorlois, and accordingly the extant (but not the original) Gorlois differs from Elcmair in that he is the victim of the father rather than of the hero. It is noteworthy however that even in Geoffrey the actual slaying of Gorlois is not attrib uted to Uther, and that the befooled husband is got rid of summarily and secondarily enough. Geoffrey gives us a harmony of RF and pre-G, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary we may as well assume that 63 Sommer ed. cit. VII 12 (line 2). 64 Cf. the name Cahoer d'Angleterre in E.

He found in RF a Cador who answered 1) in name, to the pre-G foster-father of Guenevere; 2) in function as the befooled husband, to the Gorlois of pre-G; 3) in function as the hero's mainstay in youth, to the Uther of pre-G. He accomplished the harmony by keeping Cador as foster-father of Guenevere and as the hero's mainstay in his early career, but by assigning to Gorlois not only his own but also Cador's part as befooled husband. In this way shape shifting came to be used against Gorlois. Uther, on the other hand, does not help his son as he doubtless helped him in pre-G; this help has all been left to Cador the foster-father of Guene vere by virtue of his identification with the helpful Cador of RF. Hence Arthur's upbringing and enfances are passed over in silence. That there was something to be told, however, is at tested by our glossator A. The non-G variant of FF has survived to us only in late literary form. It therefore shows much contamination from the Galfredian account, which of course had a tremendous literary vogue. In particular the influence of Geoffrey affected the birth story, and made nonsense of the secret fostering of the hero. In spite of this, however, the fostering was not given up, and its survival has made it possible for us to trace the true history of the Arthurian legend back to its beginnings, and to show that Arthur was indeed "un personnage de f?erie.'69 Kemp Malone The Johns Hopkins University 691 wish to thank the following for reading and criticising this paper in ms. : Professors T.
