<plain_text><page sequence="1">A PLASTER CAST OF A HORSE'S NOSE-PIECE FTER the publication of my "Ancient Plaster Casts of Greek Metalware" in The American Journal of Archaeology LXII, 1958, pp. 369ff., Miss Frances F. Jones informed me that the Princeton Museum had an unpublished example of such a plaster relief (Figure i) and asked if I would write a brief article on it for the Princeton bulletin. I gladly agreed to her kind proposal, and here is the note. I have not seen the ob- ject itself, but Miss Jones has verified and corrected my descrip- tion in front of the original and has given me the necessary in- formation regarding its acquisition, preservation, etc.1 More- over, Mr. Raubitschek has deciphered the inscription on the back (Figure 7) and is adding a discussion of it. As is well known, these little reliefs, which have been found in quantity at Memphis (?) in Egypt2 and at Begram in Afghan- istan,3 as well as singly here and there, have been identified as cast from the decorations on Greek metalware, such as vases, mirrors, horses' trappings, helmets, etc. The Princeton relief is easily recognizable as taken from the metal nose-piece of a horse's bridle. The pointed oval shape is the same as that of the plaster published by Rubensohn in his Hellenistisches Silber- gerdt in antiken Gipsabgiissen, no. 34, pl. IV (cf. Figure 3), and of the metal examples found with horses' trappings in the tomb of the Great Bliznitza in South Russia;4 moreover, a silver nose- 1Accession number 48-52. Height, o.166m. Width, o.o8m. Acquired in 1948. Said to be from Egypt. Pieces missing around the edge; also the man's right knee- cap, much of his lower left leg, including the foot, part of the left forearm and hand. The surface is rubbed and weathered, especially the face. The photographs for Figures i and 7 were taken by Miss Elizabeth Menzies of Princeton. 2 0.

The relief on the Princeton cast represents a warrior sitting beside a trophy. He is nude except for a chlamys, which is fastened at his neck and is then wound round h-is left forearm, in the usual manner. In the right hand he holds a stout spear (coapro-a?), the right foot is placed on his helmet, a shield is by his side. Behind him rises the trophy, anthropomorphic, clothed in a belted and pouched chiton and a chlamys with end flutter- ing to one side, and surmounted by a helmet with cheek-pieces turned down (of the same type as the helmet under the war- rior's foot). The customary cuirass on the trophy is missing; 6Althertiimer von Pergamon, II, pl. 43; pl. 47, no. 3; pl. 49, nos. 3, 22. 7 For instance by Xenophon, Pollux, Aelian, Suidas, Heliodoros; for references see the list given by Stephani, loc. cit. 55</page><page sequence="4">Figure 4.

The erection of a trophy after a victorious battle was, of course, a regular custom in Greek and Roman times. Generally a Nike is shown crowning the trophy, or carrying it, or standing by it; but the victor himself also sometimes appears, either alone or accompanied by a Nike.8 The realistic modelling of the soldier's body in the Princeton relief and the accomplished rendering of its torsion date the relief in the Hellenistic period of the third and second cen- turies B.C. That is also the time indicated by the form of the two helmets, which resemble those on Syrian, Macedonian, and Bactrian coins.9 Figures 2, 4-6 show a few pertinent examples: Figure 2, a tetradrachm of Seleukos I of Syria (312-280 B.C.), with a Nike crowning a trophy surmounted by a helmet in front view; Figure 4, a bronze coin of Macedon, struck under De- metrios Poliorketes (306-283 B.C.), with a crested helmet (the helmet, it seems, frontal, the crest in profile); Figure 5, a tetra- drachm with a helmeted head of Eukratides of Bactria (circa 200-150 B.C.) with the helmet in profile view; and Figure 6, a tetradrachm of Tryphon of Syria (142-139 B.C.) with a helmet in profile view.10 In all these helmets the constituent elements- crown, curving rim, cheek-pieces-correspond to those on the plaster. 8 Cf. A. Reinach, in Daremberg and Saglio, Dictionnaire, s.v. tropaeum; Ruben- sohn, op. cit., no. 79, pl. XIV; G. C. Picard, Les trophees romains, 1957. 9 As first pointed out to me by Dr. E. Kunze. The helmet is not gladiatorial of the Roman period, as has been suggested by some, for such helmets have a more strongly curving rim. Nor was it customary for gladiators to erect trophies; palms and crowns constituted their prizes, as well as armor and substantial sums of money. Furthermore, as Professor P. McKendrick on seeing the photograph immediately pointed out to me, the form of the shield on the Princeton cast is not that of a gladiator; cf. G. Lafaye, in Daremberg and Saglio, Dictionnaire, s.v. gladiator, p. 1597, fig. 3597. 10 Cf. B. V. Head, Historia Numorum, 2nd ed., passim, and the British Mu- seum Catalogues; also H. Seyrig, Notes on Syrian Coins, Notes and Monographs, American Numismatic Society, no. 119; Gaebler, Die antiken Miinzen von Make- donia und Paionia, pl. II, 9-62, and passim. I am much beholden to Mr. Kenneth Jenkins for help in this research and for sending me casts of the coins repro- duced in figs. 2, 4-6 (from enlarged photographs by Mr. J. Felbermeyer). 57</page><page sequence="6">Figure 7. Back of Plaster Relief in Princeton. 58</page><page sequence="7">Figre 8. Iscripti o P eton Relief (Enlarged). Figure 8.

One may, therefore, surmise that the victory celebrated on the Princeton cast was won in the East, and that the Hellenistic original from which the cast was taken was there available for reproduction. The subject naturally had a special appeal as a symbol of victory. Gisela M. A. Richter Rome 59</page></plain_text>
