<plain_text><page sequence="1">The myth of the "myth of the medieval" Gothic architecture in Vasari's rinascita and Panofsky's Renaissance ANNE-MARIE SANKOVITCH The Renaissance conception of artistic progress is familiar to all of us from Vasari's Lives. There we read of the rise of the arts from rude beginnings to their perfection, first in classical antiquity and then once more, after the Gothic disaster, through the three stages of "good," "better" and "best" to the pinnacle of Michelangelo's art. It is a picture of history that still exerts its spell even though its validity has been questioned for a century and a half. E. H. Gombrictf Crucial to the validity of this "picture of history" is the myth of the medieval, of the Gothic above all, which, although Petrarchan in origin, does appear to have first been codified for art historical practice by Vasari. As Ernst Gombrich noted half a century ago, dissatisfaction with the Vasarian scheme also has a long history; and today it seems unremarkable to observe that the Middle Ages was created primarily as the structurally necessary death allowing the Renaissance its rebirth.2 The Renaissance needed a medieval and a Gothic?Vasari's maniera tedesca?as much as, if not more than, it needed antiquity. But what if the myth of the medieval is itself a myth? Or rather, what if the Vite, the first text to propose a narrative structure for a history of all the arts from antiquity to the Renaissance, itself failed to securely locate and clearly see a medieval? According to Roland Barthes, "myth is constituted by the loss of the historical quality of things: in it, things lose the memory that they once were made."3 Through a reading of the Vite and of two critical texts by Erwin Panofsky, Vasari's strongest modern reader, this essay argues that what Vasari made and what has subsequently been made of him are in fact not the same thing; that the memory of the making of the myth of the medieval in the writing of art history is, if not entirely lost, far from perfect. Panofsky and the marnera tedesca In his highly influential article of 1930, "The First Rage of Giorgio's Vasari's 'Libro',"4 Erwin Ranofsky cites Vasari's infamous "philippic against the Gothic style," where the maniera tedesca is described as a "monstrous and barbarous," "confusion and disorder" whose "deformed" "malediction of buildings" "polluted the world."5 Ranofsky saw more than just the usual Renaissance knee-jerk antagonism towards the Petrarchan Dark Ages in Vasari's impassioned words: Precisely this opposition to the Middle Ages compelled and enabled the Renaissance really to "confront" Gothic art, and thereby, even though through glasses tinted by hostility, to see it for the first time?to see it as an alien and contemptible, yet for this very reason truly characteristic, phenomenon .. . [T]he very enmity toward the Gothic established the basis for its recognition in Italy.. . . Thus the Italian Renaissance?in a first, great retrospective view which dared to divide the development of Western art into three great periods?defined for itself a locus standi from which it could look back at the art of classical antiquity (alien in time but related in style) as well as at the art of the Middle Ages (related in time but alien in style): each of these two could be measured, as it were, by and against the other. Unjust though this method of evaluation may appear to us, it meant that, from then on, periods of civilization and art could be understood as individualities and totalities.6 1. E. H.

But the attitude of the Italian Renaissance toward the Middle Ages presupposes, in spite of its essentially negative character, a similar awareness of distance.7 Because hostility and historical distance are both conditions of difference?the unliked thing and the faraway thing are both different (from the subject who dislikes or is remote; from the object which is liked or close)?hostility and distance become interchangeable. That the Middle Ages and antiquity are differently different from the Renaissance, not alien in the same way, is elided in a chiasmus that presents their different differences as only a matter of wordplay. The Renaissance's temporal distance from antiquity and its hostility to the historically proximate Gothic are thus construed by Ranofsky as enabling the same distant and clear perception of the two "different" periods? antiquity and the Middle Ages?as periods with corresponding styles, as "individualities and totalities." Without entering into the perceptual question of whether or not distance actually produces clear sight, we can decline to assimilate hostility to distance and ask instead if hostility and the difference it presupposes actually allows for the kind of lucid visual, intellectual, and historical comprehension Panofsky wants Vasari to have of the Gothic.8 The answer is difficult, for the place assigned to hostility in Ranofsky's account shifts. On the one hand it is indeed comparable to historical distance and thus produces comprehension ("the very enmity toward the Gothic established the basis for its recognition") but on the other it is merely a superfluous emotion that results from the enabling condition of distance ("the attitude of the Italian Renaissance toward the Middle Ages presupposes, in spite of its essentially negative character, a similar awareness of distance"). It is this second position that Ranofsky takes in his analysis of Vasari's notorious description. Although Vasari claims to see "confusion and disorder" in lavori tedeschi, Ranofsky reads these words as only symptomatic of a hostility that is itself symptomatic of (rather than the cause of) Vasari's clarity of perception. Vasari's hostility is, to invoke Ranofsky's metaphor, the tint of his glasses, and if the glasses are cleared, "if we divest Vasari's remarks of their derogatory intention and phraseology, they emerge as a stylistic characterization, impossible in the Middle Ages .. . which, in a measure, is still valid today."9 Ranofsky proceeds to compare his own perception of the Gothic with Vasari's description of the maniera tedesca and concludes?as have many modern scholars?that they are looking at essentially the same thing and seeing it in the same way.10 The modern and the Renaissance art historian are finally not all that different, and Vasari's hostility becomes inconsequential to his ability to see Gothic architecture clearly as a historical style. But is it actually all that clear that Vasari and Ranofsky have the same thing in mind when they speak of maniera fecfesca/Gothic? That they in fact diverge becomes apparent when we consider the problem Ranofsky positions as the point of departure for his lengthy article: the frame Vasari sketched for a drawing he believed to be by Cimabue and which he included in his famous Libro dei disegni.u Ranofsky notes that the architecture of the drawn frame "simulates structures of a pronouncedly Gothicizing style" and so poses an 7. Ibid., pp. 189-90 n. 43. 8. That distance was an enabling condition of sight had been debated in turn-of-the-century Vienna and was advocated by Adolf Hildebrand: "Only at a certain distance from a perceived object do our eyes begin to see parallel and take the object in at a glance."

Ikonomou (Santa Monica, California: Getty Center for the Arts and Humanities, 1994), p. 243. Ranofsky transposed this view to a historical distance that allowed the Italian Renaissance to see both the medieval and antiquity clearly, while he simultaneously asserted that a naive lack of such distance prevented both the Northern European Renaissance and the Middle Ages from possessing a comparably lucid historical perspective.

As was true for other Renaissance artists, Vasari's participation in the revival of antiquity also entailed a desire to adhere to revived classical theories of art, including the principle of conformit?, that is, formal or stylistic unity.13 In the V/?ethis aesthetic principle was recast as a historical postulate demanding "spiritual uniformity within a given period."14 Thus, "Vasari's 'Gothic' frame would become completely comprehensible if we were able to show that the figurai style of a Cimabue drawing and the architectural style affected by its frame occupy the same locus within Vasari's conception of history."15 In the tripartite anthropomorphic development of the rinascita that Vasari uses to structure the Vite, Cimabue is located in the prima et? of art's childhood?as is the architect Arnolfo di Cambio to whom a Life is devoted in the 1568 V/fe.16 Consequently, "If Vasari intended to set his 'Cimabue' drawing in a 'stylistically correct' frame ... he had to devise an 'Arnolfo frame' rather than a Gothic frame pure and simple."17 Although P?nofsky notes certain anachronisms in the drawn frame indicating its sixteenth-century facture, he nevertheless concludes that it does in fact represent not a generic but a specifically Arnolfian version of the Gothic, and conforms to the style of those buildings Vasari attributed to the architect in the 1568 edition.18 While Ranofsky may not concur with Vasari's attributions, he does agree that the Florentine Duomo, Badia, and Santa Croce are Gothic and thus sees them as the models for the drawn enframement that, as "Arnolfian," is historically compatible with the "Cimabuan" image it displays. Furthermore, Ranofsky emphasizes, there is no contradiction between Vasari's harsh denunciation of the Gothic and his diligent making of a Gothic architectural frame, no inconsistency between his admiration for Arnolfo's Gothic architecture and his overall condemnation of the maniera tedesca. Vasari, he argues, "was a representative, in fact a pioneer, of a historical way of thinking." Historical "in the sense that the phenomena are not only connected in time but also evaluated according to 'their time.'"20 As a humanistic theorist committed to recovering the ideals of classicism, Vasari could only condemn the maniera tedesca for its utter disregard of all the rules of good architecture, but as an art historian devoted to the dispassionate observation and chronicling of the past he recognized that each period needed to be seen and judged relatively on its "own terms." Such a recognition of historicist contigency and relative merit meant that "Vasari, whose antagonism to the Gothic could not have been stronger, bestows warm praise upon a whole series of high- and late-medieval monuments of art and architecture."21 P?nofsky thus chides scholars who fault Vasari as inconsistent because "he approves of certain Gothic buildings while disapproving of Gothic architecture in general."22 More importantly, Vasari's historicist approach to the art of the past was a critical enabling factor for the "Gothic frame." This modest architectural drawing becomes for Ranofsky the small clue that illuminates the emergence of a great epistemic shift and the beginning of the modern practice of art history: Vasari's inconspicuous 'Gothic' frame bears witness, at a relatively early date, to the rise of a new attitude toward the heritage of the Middle Ages: it illustrates the possibility of interpreting medieval works of art, regardless of medium and maniera, as specimens of a 'period style.'... Vasari's frame marks the beginning of a strictly art-historical approach which (in contrast to the study of political, legal or liturgical documents) is focused on the visual remains and proceeds, to borrow Kant phrase, in a 'disinterested' manner... . [T]his new approach, concerned exclusively with the preservation, classification and interpretation of evidence. . .. was to bear fruit in the work of the great historians of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. And it was, ultimately, to give direction to our own activities.23 Thus, for Ranofsky, it is hardly surprising that Vasari's description of the maniera tedesca is congruent with his own perception of the Gothic, for the modern historian 12.

His eyes paradoxically clarified by hostility, Vasari was able to assume a proto-Kantian, proto-modern distance from his objects of inquiry, to see and classify them, if not properly, then at least with the proper art historical attitude. He was able to recognize, just as his modern progeny would, the Gothic as a period style, as a "characteristic phenomenon" exemplified by the architecture of Arnolfo and the Cimabue frame.24 Ranofsky's resolution of the apparent conflicts in Vasari is, however, based on a fundamental blindness. So certain is Ranofsky that Gothic and maniera tedesca are essentially synonymous that he fails to notice that not a single work of Arnolfo's is described in the Vite as displaying the maniera tedesca. Furthermore, very few lavori tedeschi actually appear in the 1568 Vite?and none at all in those early parts of the text where one would most expect to find them. Not one of the countless buildings mentioned or described in the lengthy anticipatory narrative that comprises more than half of the text dedicated to the Life of Arnolfo is in the maniera tedesca, although many?such as Milan cathedral or San Francesco in Assisi?have been deemed Gothic by modern historians.25 Also evading completely the tedesca label are the approximately fifty named individual buildings as well as the nameless "many other monasteries and churches," "many abbeys in France," "many old palaces," and the "buildings that were made in Italy ... up to the year 1250" that appear in the story of the decline and fall of the arts of antiquity in the Proemio of the prima et?.26 Again, modern art history has had little trouble designating as Gothic many of those non-man/era tedesca monuments of twelfth and thirteenth-century Italy. And if the maniera tedesca does not denote "Gothic," its above cited absences in the Vite mean plainly that it cannot be taken to designate, as has often been thought, all of medieval architecture either. The complete absence of a single identifiable?of a single seeable? maniera tedesca building or specified group of buildings in the Proemio's narrative of death and medieval decadence render unconvincing the often proposed scenario whereby Vasari unwittingly conflated all of medieval architecture into an undifferentiated mass called maniera fec/esca/Gothic, and that he did so because he was unaware of the real dates of things and was without access to the refinements subsequently wrought within the paradigm crafted by the Vite (the differentiation of Romanesque from Gothic, for example). Vasari's apparent errors of nomenclature (German rather than French) and dating (fifth rather than twelfth century) cannot be explained away so easily by art historians seeking to correct only the mistakes and to preserve intact what is perceived as the fundamentally sound chronological period-style structure and overarching medieval-versus-classical assumption of the Vite. That Vasari denounced the maniera tedesca and that he cast an unhappy eye on much of the medieval does not add up to the conclusion that by maniera tedesca Vasari meant all of medieval architecture, or most of it, or the Gothic part of it mostly.27 As much as the first Proemio mourns the fate of the arts in the long dark millennium before the rinascita, it does not apprehend the countless buildings of that vast wasteland as lavori tedeschi. This is not to say that the function of the medieval in the Vite is unrelated to that of the maniera tedesca. Rather, just as the architectural maniera tedesca unravels Ranofsky's argument by refusing to be what he needs it 24. On Ranofsky's reading of Vasari as Kantian and Kant as a humanist, see Georges Didi-Huberman, Devant l'image. Question pos?e aux fins d'une histoire de l'art (Paris: Minuit, 1990), pp. 136-139. Also see Erwin Ranofsky, "The History of Art as a Humanistic Discipline," in Meaning in the Visual Arts: Papers in and on Art History (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1955), pp. 1-25. 25. One building, no longer extant at the time the Vite was written, by an architect Vasari calls "Buono," is, however, della maniera de' Gotti; Vasari, Vite (1568), vol. 2, p. 48. 26. Ibid., pp. 23, 24, 27. 27. The understanding of Vasari's maniera tedesca as meaning both Gothic and/or also all of medieval architecture is so omnipresent in the literature that it appears in such diverse recent works as Hans Belting, The End of the History of Art, rev. ed. trans. C. S. Wood (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), p. 89; and Patricia Lee Rubin, Giorgio Vasari: Art and History (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1995), pp. 1, 212, and passim. In addition to the authors cited in note 10, other studies that are devoted more specifically to the question of Vasari's maniera tedesca and also read it as Gothic/medieval include: E. S. de Beer, "Gothic: Origin and Diffusion of the Term; The Idea of Style in Architecture," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 11 (1948):145-149; Antonio Thiery, "II Medieovo nell'lntroduzione e nel Proemio d?lie Vite," in // Vasari storiografo e artista. Atti del congresso internazionale nel IV centenario della morte (Florence: Isituto Nazionale di Studi sul Rinascimento, 1976), pp. 351-381; andT. S. R. Boase, "The Maniera Tedesca," chap. 4 in Giorgio Vasari: The Man and the Book (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1979). Vasari's text has sometimes been translated to conform with this meaning. Thus la todesca e barbara is translated as "the uncouth Gothic manner" in Vasari's Lives of the Artists, trans. Mrs. J. Foster (1850) abridged and ed. B. Burroughs (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1946), p. 72; and peggio che le tedesche as "worse than the Gothic" by Wittkower (see note 10), p. 20. Given the argument that will be presented here, it should be stressed that scholars either cite the 1568 edition or conflate its meaning with that of the 1550 edition and see no difference between the two insofar as maniera tedesca is understood to designate "Gothic" or "medieval."</page><page sequence="5">Sankovitch: The myth of the "myth of the medieval" 33 to be, so too will we find that it does not settle with ease into the structure of the Vite; in fact, it resists this structure, thereby causing and revealing numerous cracks and flaws within it. Precisely because the modern project of art history must elide and blur, and make great conjectural-qua-empirical leaps to pin the maniera tedesca down to a familiar, knowable and relatively secure art historical location, we should not be surprised to find that Vasari must similarly grapple with it in the text that first gave shape to, defined, and authorized this project.28 Reading Vasari and the maniera tedesca To try come to some understanding of Vasari's maniera tedesca I propose that his hostility should be taken seriously (as should those places where he is able to look upon it with equanimity or even with pleasure). The enumerated traits and the hostility cannot be pried apart as if they were inconsequential to each other. Nor should we try to account for Vasari's antipathy by identifying external pressures on the Vite that can explain (away) and tame his anger and fear. Just as it is critically problematic to strip the antagonism from Vasari's denunciation and, having so purged the text, attempt to decipher in the remains a list of traits that can point to real buildings out there in the physical world,29 by the same token we should not overlook the traits and rationalize the hostility in terms of, for example, Tuscan or Medicean ideologies.30 I want instead to be closely attentive to the role of the maniera tedesca inside the textual realm of the Vite, and to read the Vite as a self focusing, self-constituting, self-reflecting world. The text of the Vite is embedded in and engages a dense web of ancient, trecento, quattrocento, and Cinquecento texts, many of which were its barely disguised sources, others sharing common themes with it.31 If all texts are porous, the V/fe's is a veritable sieve. Consequently there is a tendency to read it not as an autonomous text but as merged into a global text that tells us what Renaissance people collectively thought about things. It has been easy to disregard the awkward absences of the maniera tedesca in the Vite because other texts, which offer a clearly medieval tedesca manner, are consulted to fill in the gaps and tell us what Vasari "forgot" to say.32 In interpreting the maniera tedesca, philology has become exegesis, pasting onto the text meanings pulled from its nonexistent depths. Reading the 1568 Wie instead as a self-enclosed entity, without searching outside of it for tools that can repair and render seamless its scratched and broken surface, provides our best access to the uncanny strangeness of Vasari's maniera tedesca. The maniera tedesca figured Often overlooked is that the evocative denunciation of the maniera tedesca appears at the end of the chapter on the orders (in the section of the Vite on materials and techniques that precedes the historical narratives of the first Proemio and the Lives proper). Having discussed 28. The problematic relationship of Vasari's art historical model to the modern practice of art history has recently been considered by Belting (see note 27), and by Didi-Huberman who pays particular attention to Ranofsky, and notes "Il y aurait ? retracer toute une histoire de la conception du Moyen Age comme 'maillon faible' de l'histoire de l'art, depuis Vasari jusqu'? Ranofsky," without, however, exploring this question any further; (see note 24), p. 258 n. 164. 29. Indeed, E. H. Gombrich has argued that Vasari's denunciation of the maniera tedesca is based on Vitruvius's critique of Roman fresco paintings. Thus "the origins of the stylistic category of the Gothic do not lie in any morphological observation of buildings, but entirely in the prefabricated category of sins which Vasari took over from his authority." E. H. Gombrich, "Norm and Form: The Stylistic Categories of Art History and Their Origins in Renaissance Ideals," in Gombrich on the Renaissance. Volume 1: Norm and Form (1966; 4th ed. with additional bibliography, London: Phaidon, 1985), p. 83. 30. The most extensive interpretation of the maniera tedesca in terms of tensions between Medicean Florence and Northern "German" Europe is offered by Thiery (see note 27). Thiery's reading, which rests upon the questionable assumption that Vasari is more critical of late medieval architecture in 1568 than he is in 1550, confounds the architectural maniera tedesca with Tedeschi the people. But if anything can be said to be clear in the Vite, it is that Vasari does distinguish between the two and does not attribute the former to the latter. 31. The fundamental studies of Vasari's sources are Wolfgang Kallab, Vasaristudien (Vienna: Karl Graeser, 1908); and Schlosser (see note 10).

Today they are not used by the most gifted architects, who instead flee from them as monstrous and barbarous and forsaken of all that comprises order?which should rather be called confusion and disorder?for they have made in their buildings, which are so numerous that they have polluted the world, portals adorned with columns that are thin and twisted like vines and do not have the strength to bear a load, no matter how light. Similarly, for all the facades and their other ornaments, they built a malediction of little tabernacles, one above the other, with so many pyramids and points and leaves that it appears impossible that they can stand up or even bear their own weight; and they seem to have been made of paper rather than of stone or marble. And in these works they made so many projections and breaks, little corbels and vine tendrils, that they threw their works out of proportion; and often, by placing one thing above another, they reached such a height that the top of a portal touched the roof. This maniera was invented by the Goths who, having ruined the ancient buildings and after the death of the architects in the wars, afterwards made?those who were left?buildings in this maniera: they turned the vaults with pointed segments [quarti acut?], and filled all of Italy with this malediction of buildings; so that no more of them may be made their method has been entirely abandoned. May God save every country from the advent of such an idea and order of works, which, being so deformed in comparison with the beauty of our buildings, merit no further comment.33 Vasari here fabricates the necessary counterexemplum that will allow the specific qualities of the just-discussed classical orders, which collectively constitute the expressive forms of the buona maniera, to be clearly apprehended. The architecture figured in the maniera tedesca passage thus embodies the positive yet irrational and thus unquantifiable presence of the complete absence of good classical architecture. In contrast to the "ancient and modern, true and good manner" whose buildings are "virile, solid, and simple,"34 the maniera tedesca produces structures that are characterized above all by weakness and excess. Unlike the classical orders, its columns imitate not the rational proportions of the human body but the frail forms of twisted vines.35 Furthermore, the buildings seem to swarm with tendrils, vines, and leaves, as if overtaken by and in imitation of rampant nature. Resembling ephemeral paper assemblages rather than enduring stone structures, the maniera tedesca buildings are rickety and feeble and display an excessive piling up of too many things that are themselves often enfeebled and little (tabernacolini, mensoline, and viticci). In the maniera tedesca we see an architecture that is clearly opposed to the "virile, solid, and simple," yet is also perceived with such revulsion that it can hardly be seen clearly. The vera e buona maniera can display variety in its compositions, but such variety "does not distort with too little or too much ... the sight of the person who seeks to understand it."36 The confused and disordered, excessive and precarious proliferation of the maniera tedesca buildings, however, refracts this probing sight. Moreover, the immoderate and elusive character of the maniera tedesca is not limited to its built objects, but is also manifest in its geographic spread. Appallingly, it is everywhere present?having polluted the entire world?yet is also frighteningly amorphous and difficult to pin down. In distinction to the preceding accounts of the Rustic, Doric, and so on, where Vasari names ancient and modern built examples, in the maniera tedesca passage he refers to no single building, thereby leaving a void that historians have filled with everything 33.

The primary function of the description is not then to point to a catalogue of real buildings out there in the world, but to conjure a theoretical antimodel that serves as a clarifying oppositional optic for the rational and lucid architecture of both the ancients and the moderns. The maniera tedesca in history The description of the maniera tedesca also differs from that of the classical orders in that Vasari names its inventors and assigns it a specific moment of historical emergence. This information is elaborated in the narrative sections of the Vite where the origins and history of the maniera tedesca stigmatize it as unnatural and anticlassical as much as do its physical traits. That is, when we turn from description to history we find an architecture whose aberrant forms are homologous with its story.38 In the Proemio of the prima et? Vasari narrates the decline of the arts beginning with the reign of Constantine and the subsequent destruction of Rome by Christian iconoclasts, invading Visigoths, Vandals, Ostrogoths, and lastly Constantine II who "ruined, plundered, and carried away all that remained in the miserable city of Rome."39 It is a terrible story of imperial neglect and abandonment; followed by multiple sackings and pillagings, the razing of the city's walls and the looting of its buildings, unspeakable cruelties and humiliations, bloody combat, and near apocalyptic devastation as Ostrogothic fire "burnt the entire city and robbed it of every living body."40 By the time these wretched centuries were over the "most excellent craftsmen, sculptors, painters and architects" were "buried and submerged in the miserable carnage and ruins ofthat most illustrious city,"41 and architecture, the hardiest of the three arts and the last to die, finally suffers the fate of painting and sculpture: The same thing happened to architecture, for it was necessary to build, but form and the good mode were entirely lost because of the death of the craftsmen and the destruction and ruin of the works, and those who devoted themselves to this practice built nothing that either in order or measure had any grace, or design, or reason whatsoever. Whence there came to arise again [risorgere] new architects who produced from their barbarian nations the mode of that maniera of buildings that today are called by us tedeschi.. .42 Appearing in the total absence of ordine, misura, and d?segno, the maniera tedesca emerges at the nadir of Vasari's story, at the degree-zero moment when the buona maniera antica had been entirely extinguished, its pillaged monuments in ruins and all knowledge of it buried with the corpses of the architects.43 Vasari's use of risorgere is arresting, for it suggests a counterfeit rinascita as a miscreant architecture is born grotesquely from and built callously upon ruins and graves. Generated from the coupling of death and barbarian chaos the maniera tedesca hypostatizes the unnatural birth of a bad anticlassicism rather than the wholesome rebirth of good classicism. Furthermore, the conditions of its emergence will mark it as feeble and diseased, as reifying the corruption that surrounds it, for once born the maniera tedesca is almost immediately superseded. Spawned in the ruins, it soon becomes sterile and has scant issue: Whence there came to arise again new architects who produced from their barbarian nations the mode of that maniera of buildings that today are called by us tedeschi, and some of the buildings they made are more a source of derision for us moderns than a credit to them; until a better form, somewhat similar to the good ancient one, was afterwards found by better craftsmen, as that manner can be 37. Frankl (see note 10), p. 291; and Boase (see note 27), p. 94. 38. Even in this the maniera tedesca seems the perverse opposite of the buona maniera, for, as Philip Sohm has discussed, Vasari extended the architectural quality of ordine not only to the other arts but also to the structure of the history of art.

Photo: Marvin Trachtenberg. seen throughout all of Italy in the oldest, but not the ancient, churches which they built: such as the palace of Theodoric, king of Italy, in Ravenna, and one in Ravia, and another in Modena, all in a barbarous manner, and rich and grand rather than well conceived or of good architecture.44 Vanishing virtually at the moment of its coming into being, the maniera tedesca has time to plant but a few anonymous monuments before it is cut short and replaced by better builders in possession of a manner that, while far from the antique ideals of classicism, nevertheless is of a form different and better than that of the maniera tedesca and even "somewhat similar" to that of the buona antica. It is this new manner (whose beginnings Vasari dates to the early fifth century)45 not the maniera tedesca, that produces buildings that are "grand and magnificent but of the clumsiest architecture" and that spreads throughout Italy and elsewhere (appearing in the Benedictine abbeys of France) in the following centuries.46 Over time this manner is transformed and supplanted, slowly but perceptibly, as additional incremental improvements are made to architecture until 1250, at which point the architectural narrative of the Proemio concludes. The story is picked up again, with some overlap, in the Life of Arnolfo. With few powers of regeneration, the maniera tedesca, quickly born and just as quickly gone, is not then the fate of all subsequent medieval architecture (as is commonly believed). In the narratives of the Proemio and Life of Arnolfo it is absent from the early fifth century onward and marks a sharp turning point in the history of architecture, not the beginning of a long period within this history. It is a dark deep pit, which architecture almost immediately starts doggedly to climb out of and which builders do not look back to. Leaving untainted such apparently "Gothic" works as Giovanni Pisano's facade of Siena cathedral and Santa Maria della Spina in Pisa (also attributed by Vasari to 44. Ibid., vol. 2, pp. 22-23, emphasis added: "Onde ne vennero a risorgere nuovi architetti, che delle loro barbare nazioni fecero il modo di quel la maniera di edifiz? ch'oggi da noi son chiamati tedeschi, i quali facevano alcune cose pi? tosto a noi moderni ridicole che a loro lodevoli; finch? la miglior forma e alquanto alla buona antica simile trovarono poi i migliori artefici, come si veggono di quella maniera per tutta Italia le pi? vecchie chiese, e non antiche, ehe da essi furon edif?cate: come da Teodorico re d'ltalia un palazzo in Ravenna, uno in Ravia et un altro in Modena, pur di maniera barbara e pi? tosto riech i e grandi che bene intesi o di buona architettura." 45. One of the earliest buildings in this manner, the church of San Giovanni Evangelista in Ravenna, is dated by Vasari to 438 ibid., p. 23. 46. Vasari, Vite. (1568), vol. 2, p. 23: "I quali tutti edifizii . . . sono e grandi e magnifici, ma di goffissima architettura."</page><page sequence="9">Sankovitch: The myth of the "myth of the medieval" 37 Giovanni),47 the maniera tedesca is not reanimated until almost a thousand years after its original appearance when it is seen for the very first time in specific buildings: two Florentine structures of the prima et?, Giotto's Campanile and Orcagna's tabernacle in Or San Mich?le (figs. 1 and 2). There is no longer anything pathological about it, however, Vasari casually noting only that the Campanile "was in that maniera tedesca which was used in that time."48 Even more, Vasari finds that the Campanile?the first maniera tedesca building encountered in the Vite?was "built in such a manner that it is not possible that stones could be joined with greater diligence, or that a more beautiful tower, for its ornament, expense, or design, could be made."49 Similarly praised is Orcagna's tabernacle, which "has so much grace and proportion that it has first place amongst the works of those times."50 A markedly tranquil lack of concern is also manifest as the maniera tedesca makes a few glancing appearances in the seconda et? and in an early Life of the ferza ef?.51 It is only in the Life of Brunelleschi that?for the first time since the denunciation in the prefatory section?we get some sense of it as a negative phenomenon: the divinely sent Filippo undertakes to "return to light good architecture," and to recover "the good ancient orders," a task he assumes because good architecture is dead and everywhere people "venerate" and build in the "barbarous" maniera tedesca.52 But it is as Vasari enters his own time that the maniera tedesca becomes once again dangerous and threatening, for it is reanimated with frightening clarity in the terza et?, just at the moment when good classical architecture is supposed to have attained its full perfection and triumphant rebirth. Vasari writes of Tasso, whose architecture is without "measure or order," that Figure 2. Andrea Orcagna, Tabernacle, Or San Mich?le, Florence, 1352-1359. Photo: Marvin Trachtenberg. "it could be said that I'ordine tedesco had begun to regain life in Tuscany by the hand of this man."53 And Giuliano d'Agnolo produces a pair of windows that he "so chopped up with projections, little corbels, and breaks, that they are closer to the maniera tedesca than to the ancient and modern, true and good manner."54 It is, however, when he looks at Antonio da Sangallo's model for Saint Peter's (fig. 3) that Vasari is truly appalled; so much so that he attributes his censure to Michelangelo and other, unnamed critics. It seemed to Michelangelo, and also to many others who saw San Gallo's model . .. that Antonio's composition was too fragmented by projections and by members which are too little, as are also the columns, arches upon arches, and cornices upon cornices. In addition, it seems to have been disliked that the two bell-towers he made there, the four 47. Ibid., pp. 65-66. 48. Ibid., p. 115: "fu di quella maniera tedesca che in quel tempo s'usava."

What has gone unnoticed, however, is that although Sangallo's model is not in complete alignment with the "malediction of buildings" that earlier reify the maniera tedesca, it is the one project in the entire Vite (along with Giuliano d'Agnolo's architecture of fragmenting projections and little corbels) that Vasari describes in such physical detail as embodying so concretely the maniera tedesca. The works of Giotto and Orcagna, by contrast, are not only inconsistent with the maniera tedesca because they are beautiful and graceful rather than "monstrous and barbarous," but also because none of their traits textually rendered by Vasari match those he lists for the maniera tedesca in its detailed denunciation. It should be remembered that the only images used to illustrate the individual Lives were the woodcut portraits of the artists. The objects of analysis?the paintings, sculptures, and buildings?were not graphically but textually figured. Like pictorial ?mages, such textual figurations have a status as cultural artifacts that is independent of their interpretive and referential function. That is, they are representations that have their own discrete existence and should not be evaluated as more or less successful attempts at ekphratic isomorphism.56 And in the self-sustaining world of the 55. Ibid., vol. 5, p. 48: "Rareva a Michelagnolo, et a molti altri ancora che hanno veduto il model lo del Sangallo ... che il componimento d'Antonio venisse troppo sminuzzato dai risalti e dai membri che sono piccoli, si come anco sono le colonne, archi sopra archi, e cornici sopra cornici.

Since Svetlana Alpers' article of 1960 (see note 31) the role of the classical rhetorical mode of ekphrasis in the writings of Vasari and in Renaissance writings in general has been much debated. For a</page><page sequence="11">Sankovitch: The myth of the "myth of the medieval" 39 Vite it is only sixteenth-century projects that Vasari figures?clearly and with hostility?as embodiments of the confused and disordered, monstrous and barbarous maniera tedesca. The perception of the maniera tedesca in the works of Tasso, Giulano d'Agnolo, and above all Antonio da Sangallo is not predicated on some safe recognition of historical distance, on Vasari's position at a lofty dispassionate locus standi removed from a phenomenon securely bracketed away in time. To the contrary, the maniera tedesca only attains its frightening lucidity with proximity. The closer the maniera tedesca gets to Vasari, penetrating and polluting his own time, the more clearly does he see it; the more it thickens around him, the more is he able to figure it in all its accursed detail. The life of the maniera tedesca This is not to say that the maniera tedesca is "really" a sixteenth-century maniera. Far from it: the maniera tedesca had a veritable life in the Vite long before it emerges in Sangallo's model. The point is rather that its life is deviant. The maniera tedesca is perversely anticlassical in its excessive and feeble forms and also in its morbid origins and abnormal afterlife. Vasari traces for the buona maniera of all three arts a life cycle based on a natural biological pattern: "like human bodies [the arts] have their birth, growth, aging, and death."57 In contrast, the maniera tedesca, grotesquely born in the ashes of Rome, never lives a natural life or dies a natural death. Its corrupt physiology is not comparable to human processes: it does not grow and mature?live?in the period when it should live, nor does it die when it should die and leave the rinascita uncontaminated. Nor is its prolonged absence a real death, for, although virtually unseen, it nevertheless has somehow managed to pollute the world, and its reappearance out in the open is no rebirth. Instead, it briefly emerges in the trecento without fanfare, no longer diseased and feeble, but in the preternatural bloom of youthful beauty and grace in works by Giotto and Orcagna. Apparently vanquished by the divinely dispatched Brunelleschi, it again regains life in the sixteenth century, not, however, in some tentative prima et? of childhood but full-blown and mature, stronger and more visible than ever. Panofsky wrote that the "bold and beautiful structure" of the Vite reveals "fissures" just at those junctures where external events?barbarian catastrophe, divine intercession?must be drawn in by Vasari to alter the natural developmental pattern of the arts and propel them towards death or rebirth.58 No deus ex machina intervenes in the progress of the maniera tedesca, however, precisely because by its very nature it does not adhere to a natural sequence of growth, aging, and death. It ignores such biotic imperatives and has, as it were, a life of its own. Like a revenant rather than a healthy living body, it lives not a mortal life but a ceaseless and unpredictable afterlife. It does not die and seems impossible to kill. Mutable and mercurial, it overruns the borders between the epochs as if recalling its first makers who burst forth from alien chaos and overran the borders of civilization. Incarnating the anticlassical physiologically as well as ontogenetically, in both its material traces and its history, it is indeed a "monstrous and barbarous" "malediction," and we can understand why Vasari implores God to "save every country" from its malign presence. Confused and disordered, graceful and beautiful, vanquished yet never gone, formally and temporally uncanny, the maniera tedesca is unconstrained by the period-style structure Vasari seeks to impose on the Vite, and its formal inconsistencies are equally unamenable to management by Panofsky's logic of a theorist/historicist Vasari. From 1550 to 1568 After witnessing the changeable nature of the maniera tedesca and its fugitive historical trajectory in the 1568 Vite, what we find when we turn to the first edition of 1550 is more than astonishing. Here we encounter a maniera tedesca that, while variable as a critically observed phenomenon, has a far more secure place in the V/fe's historical narrative. In the Proemio o? the prima et?, following the identical account of the destruction of Rome and the arts, Vasari had written: Whence there came to arise again new architects who produced from their barbarian nations the mode of that maniera of buildings that today are called by us tedeschi, summary of some of the relevant bibliography, see Leonard Barkan, Unearthing the Past: Archeology and Aesthetics in the Making of Renaissance Culture (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1999), p. 342 n. 16. As "ekphrasis" presupposes some degree of verifiable fidelity to its object, I prefer "figuration," which stresses and values the variable and contingent nature of evocative detailed descriptions, and the autonomous as well as the referential character of such descriptions.

Panofsky, "The First Rage," p. 221.</page><page sequence="12">40 RES 40 AUTUMN 2001 and some of the buildings they made are more a source of derision for us moderns than a credit to them; until a better form was afterwards found by better craftsmen, as that manner may be seen throughout all of Italy in the oldest, but not the ancient, churches which they built, such as the Duomo of Pisa, which was built in 1016 following the plan of the architect Buschetto, a Greek from Dulichium.... The Duomo of Milan, made in the same manner, was built in 1388, and that of Siena and infinite buildings alia tedesca of the same sort, and many palaces and various buildings which can be seen in all of Italy and beyond, such as San Marco in Venice, the Certosa of Ravia, the Santo of Padua, San Petronio in Bologna, San Martino in Lucca, the Duomo of Arezzo, the Pieve, the Bishop's Palace completed by Pope Gregory X (a Piacenzan of the Visconti family), and similarly the temple of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, made by Arnolfo, tedesco architect.59 The emergence of the maniera tedesca is here situated vaguely?although not incongruously?sometime between the fall of Rome and 1016. The better manner, which comes after it and is used to construct so many buildings throughout Italy (and elsewhere), is not a different manner, as in the 1568 edition, but only an improved version of it. The dry inventory of buildings, which is reiterated and amplified by a few additions in a similar list in the Life of Brunelleschi (deleted in 1568),60 together with the infamous denunciatory description, are essentially the sum total of what the 1550 Vite has to say about the maniera tedesca. Arnolfo is not given a Life of his own but is only mentioned in passing in the Life of Cimabue.61 Orcagna's tabernacle, although present, is not apprehended as being in the maniera tedesca, nor are any projects of the seconda and ferza et?. Neither Tasso nor Giuliano d'Agnolo make an appearance. Antonio da Sangallo's architecture is praised as manifesting all the Vitruvian virtues and his model for Saint Peter's receives unqualified accolades for its "elegant and well-proportioned composition" and its "beautiful forms."62 The Campanile, whose beauty is again evident, rather than being the first building seen in the maniera tedesca, is among the last. In short, in the 1550 Vite the maniera tedesca is docilely ensconced just where it should be: between the fall of Rome and the arrival of Brunelleschi. It is true that its history is not rendered with any great precision, nor are its individual buildings seen in any detail. It has the same unsavory origins as it will in 1568. Its first appearance as a "malediction" is irreconcilable with the beauty of the Campanile, and if we push hard enough lacunae could be seen to multiply. But none of these lapses would concern temporality and chronology.63 Like Manetti's modi Tedeschi and Raphael's maniera deWarchitectura Tedescha, the 1550 maniera tedesca does not stray out of its historical time but remains safely immured within it.64 Vasari wants to write a story of "the perfection, and ruin, and restoration, or, to put it better, rinascita" of the arts;65 a sequential history in clearly compartmentalized phases in which the period of death and ruin, of pure anticlassicism, is structurally necessary for that of rebirth. The rinascita cannot be apprehended, or even by definition occur, in the absence of a medieval maniera tedesca. In 1550 the maniera tedesca effortlessly fulfills its narrative obligations and allows the Vites highly original story to be told. What happened then in the eighteen years between 1550 and 1568? Vasari himself tells us: "I have had time to better comprehend many things and to reconsider many others ... to search all of Italy again and to see and understand many things which had not previously 59. Vasari, Vite (1550), vol. 2, pp. 22-27: "Onde ne vennero a risorgere nuovi architetti, che delle loro barbare nazioni fecero il modo di quella maniera di edifici ch'oggi da noi son chiamati tedeschi, i quali facevano alcune cose pi? tosto a noi moderni ridicole che a loro lodevoli; finch? la miglior forma trovarono poi i migliori artefici, come si veggono di quella maniera per tutta Italia le pi? vecchie chiese, e non antiche, che da essi furono edif?cate, si com'in Pisa la pianta del Duomo da Buschetto, greco da Dul?chio, architetto edificata nel MXVI....

Ibid. vol. 5, p. 28; p. 48: "egli con ordine nuovo e modo straordinario, di leggiadria e di proporzionata composizione e di decoro e distribuzione de' suoi luoghi con bellissimi corpi in pi? parti de quella situati e fermi." 63. Reading the 1550 Vite with knowledge of the 1568 Vite in mind, however, a phrase that might otherwise go unnoticed takes on a strange prescience. In the ekphratic denunciation of lavori tedeschi that is shared by the two editions Vasari writes, "n? oggi s'usano per gli eccellenti, ma son fuggiti da loro come mostruosi e barbari," thereby suggesting that other architects?those who are not gli eccellenti?do not similarly flee. Vasari, Vite (1550 and 1568), vol. 1, p. 67. 64. Manetti (see note 32), p. 63; Raphael (see note 32), p. 101. 65.

Among the changes Vasari made to the second edition was that, although architecture was demoted in the title, it received far more attention in the text.67 A number of architects' Lives were added and architecture was examined much more closely. One result of this keener scrutiny was that the maniera tedesca, as discussed above, reveals a restless, temporally perverse nature, and, escaping its historical shackles, materializes long after it should be dead and gone. Instead of clearly marked and tightly sealed borders separating the maniere of the three major periods of antiquity, the Middle Ages, and reborn antiquity, the finest of evanescent lines divides the buona maniera from the tedesca. When Vasari looks a little closer the line disappears altogether: Sangallo's model, once "elegant and well-proportioned" becomes the apotheosis of the maniera et opera tedesca. The fragility and permeability of the border line and the brittleness of the revised text are similarly displayed when, having praised Michelangelo's variation of the Composite order (in a passage also new to the 1568 edition), Vasari criticizes "certain of our vulgar, pompous architects," who "not having judiciously weighed and not having imitated these things [created by Michelangelo] have made, without any design and almost carelessly?without observing decorum, art or any order whatsoever?all their monstrous things even worse than the tedesche."6S If, as Vasari tells us here, Michelangelo has surpassed the ancients in his perfection of the Composite (and many other things), his vulgar contemporaries?not paying close enough attention to his example?have gone beyond the maniera tedesca in monstrosity and disorder.69 But why should it have been necessary for them to pay such close attention? Manifestations of the maniera tedesca should theoretically embody the total absence of the classical and be temporally and spatially absolutely different from the buona maniera. Yet such distance is nowhere apparent: if one false step is taken it is a step into the void. If an architect does not duplicate Michelangelo precisely and with the utmost care, the result is not something that falls a bit short of his great example but its complete opposite: the long steep slope between the peak and the abyss collapses into rubble. In 1550 Vasari designated the maniera tedesca as the enabling foil that would allow the buona maniera of the ancients and the moderns to be seen with back-lit clarity. As such, the maniera tedesca cannot be jettisoned from the 1568 Vite. At the same time, now seen itself with greater clarity, it can only become more true to its antithetical nature, refuse its quarantine in the Middle Ages, and steal into the heart of the ferza et?. The maniera tedesca, a corrupt and dead anticlassicism, is deeply necessary to the Vite, to the rebirth of the buona maniera, and to the perception and figuration of this rinascita, but its necessity is potentially lethal. 66. Vasari, V7fe (1568), vol. 1, p. 175: "avendo avuto spazio poi d'intendere molte cose meglio e rivederne molte altre ... di ricercar di nuovo tutta l'ltalia e vedere et intendere molte cose che prima non m'erano venute a notizia."

V7fe (1568) vol. 1, pp. 65-66: "Le quali cose non considerando con buon giudicio e non le immitando, hanno ? tempi nostri certi architetti plebei prosontuosi e senza disegno fatto quasi a caso?senza servar decoro, arte o ordine nessuno?tutte le cose mostruose e peggio che le tedesche." 69. The ambiguous nature of Michelangelo's achievements and their influence on his contemporaries appears in another passage about Michelangelo's Composite order at the New Sacristy of San Lorenzo: "vi fece dentro un ornamento composite nel pi? vario e pi? nuovo modo ehe per tempo alcuno gli antichi e i moderni maestri abbino potuto operare: perch? nella novit? di si belle cornici, capitegli e base ... fece assai diverso da quel lo che di misura, ordine e regola facevano gli uomini secondo il comune uso e secondo Vitruvio e le antichit?, per non volere a quello agiugnere. La qu?le licenzia ha dato grande animo, a quelli che ?nno veduto il far suo, di mettersi a imitarlo, e nuove fantasie si son? veduto poi, alla grottesca pi? tosto che a ragione o regola, a' loro ornamenti." Ibid., vol. 6, pp. 54-55. Here Vasari brings up the concept of licenzia, which paradoxically requires that a work display knowledge and firm command of misura, ordine, and regola while simultaneously breaking and abandoning these very same conventions. The dual task of making present that which is absent within a composition predicated on the foregrounding of absence is not surprisingly slippery and unpredictable, and Michelangelo's ornamento composito can easily become another's grottesca (or lavoro tedesco).

When Vasari looks again he sees that it is already present and haunts the perfection created by the "divine Michelangelo."72 The maniera tedesca and the medieval Yet why is the seditious movement of the maniera tedesca into the rinascita?inevitable as it may be? accompanied by its evacuation from its original home in the Middle Ages? It is easy to perceive where this maniera is present in 1568, but we should not overlook its striking absences. All the buildings that Vasari assembles with such confidence in those laconic lists of the 1550 Vite either drop out of the second edition altogether, or, in the great majority of cases, reappear cleansed of the maniera tedesca. They are, furthermore, joined by newly seen medieval buildings?San Francesco in Assisi, Santa Maria della Spina in Pisa? that are also free of the maniera tedesca. On the one hand such re- and declassification seems to further confirm the protean and fugitive nature of this maniera, but on the other it also points to deeper difficulties. Formally and theoretically the maniera tedesca is what medieval architecture should be: anticlassicism incarnate. Historically medieval architecture is what the maniera tedesca should be: situated between the fifth and fifteenth centuries. These two entities should be coextensive. For the Vite to work properly and tell the story Vasari wants to tell, they need to be identical. Vasari wants them to be fused as a single, nonoscillating, formal, and historical phenomenon. As he rewrites, cuts, and edits, he scrambles to preserve from the first text material that will somehow allow this desire to be met. In 1550 he wrote, in the Life of Brunelleschi, for example, "he merits even more praise because in his time the maniera tedesca was venerated throughout Italy and was practiced by all the old craftsmen, as can be seen in an infinity of buildings: San Petronio in Bologna, Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, the church of Santa Croce. . . ."73 In 1568, no longer able to figure any of the listed buildings as lavori tedeschi, he nevertheless reiterates the first part of the sentence as if simply stating that an infinity of such buildings exists will persuade us of the fact. Rarely is the conflict between author and subject so starkly exposed as it is in the 1568 Vite as Vasari struggles with the unruly and disorderly maniera tedesca. He wants it and needs it to be medieval but it won't comply. Sensing this need, later art historians, as if paying tribute to the father of the field, and also as an act of epistemological self-preservation, have let Vasari have what he wants?what they want. Without ever allowing the perversity of the maniera tedesca to be registered consciously, they have repaired the misalignments in Vasari's structure by fixing his apparent omissions and mistakes, stripping away his hostility, conflating the two editions into a single oeuvre, and using other texts, such as those of Manetti and Raphael or the documents generated by the San Petronio controversy (none of which, unlike the 1568 Vite, actually seek to narrate a history of medieval architecture),74 as exegetical glosses that tell us what the 1568 Vite itself does not manage to say?what it presumably meant to have said.75 The maniera tedesca has thereby been returned safely to its mythic medieval home and the Vite, indeed art history itself, settles into the pattern of three clearly ordered, cleanly separated, rationally seen periods where the middle phase is defined in opposition to its classical 70. Panofsky, "The First Rage," p. 220. 71. Ibid., p. 218. 72. It is deeply revealing of the anxieties that pick away at the Vite that Michelangelo and a hostilely seen maniera tedesca twice make a joint appearance in the text, for we recall that it was Michelangelo, as if together with his divinely bestowed gifts he had also been cursed with cruel insight, who penetrated beyond the superficial glance that saw bellissimi corpi in Sangallo's model and perceived the maniera tedesca lurking there instead. 73. Vasari, Wie (1550), vol. 3, p. 196: "tanto pi? m?rita lode, quanto n? tempi suoi era la maniera tedesca in venerazione per tutta Italia e dagli artefici vecchi esercitata, come in infiniti edifici si vede: San Petronio di Bologna, Santa Maria del Fiore in Fiorenza, la chiesa di Santa Croce et Orto S. Mich?le, e s?milmente il palazzo e la loggia de' Signori; la Certosa di Ravia, il Duomo di Siena e quello di Pisa, e molti altri edifici che non fa mestiero nominar!i." 74. On the bitter debates surrounding the (still) unfinished facade of San Petronio in Bologna, see Ranofsky, "The First Rage," pp. 196-205; and Wittkower (see note 10). 75. That such buildings as San Giovanni Evangelista in Ravenna, San Marco in Venice, Milan cathedral, and the Benedictine abbeys of France are not lavori tedeschi in 1568, while Orcagna's tabernacle and Giotto's Campanile are, calls into question any argument that the changes between the two editions reflect the pressures of Florentine or Tuscan campanilismo.</page><page sequence="15">Sankovitch: The myth of the "myth of the medieval" 43 frames, which are in turn given legibility and substance by the anticlassicism they enclose. It has been an oddly sympathetic misreading: if art historians have read against the grain of the text, they have done so in apparent collusion with and obeisance to its author's desires. But the fix is superficial, and the text heaves below its thinly papered-over surface. Furthermore, in refusing to contemplate the flaws in Vasari's historical structure, in casting the maniera tedesca as an early version of medieval or Gothic architecture that only needs correcting in minor details, art history has blinded itself to the genuine, if alarming, insights offered by the Vite. For if we look again more closely at the 1568 Vite, we see not only the absence of the maniera tedesca in the medieval, but a presence that is equally destablizing. Another consequence of Vasari's decision "to see and understand many things which had not previously come to my attention" was the inclusion of two lengthy architectural narratives in the Proemio of the prima et?. The first charts the decline of architecture from Constantine to the barbarian invasions, the second (which replaces the 1550 Pisa-to-Florence list) relates its tentative progress from the fifth century to 1250. In each case, the buildings Vasari chooses as illustrative examples strain against and often reroute altogether the narrative arc that should contain them. An ongoing battle is played out between the story (its theoretical, critical, and historical imperatives) and its rebellious objects. The stress of this continuous conflict disfigures and finally destroys the integrity of the two architectural narratives.76 The story of the decline begins: "architecture had suffered less damage than the other arts of design." After taking a look at three Constantinian structures, Vasari finds himself reiterating "architecture . . . continued to maintain itself, if not in a perfect, then in a better condition." At this point some explanation for such atypical vigor is called for: architects had access to spoils and thus it was easy for them "to imitate in large part the old," particularly as they had many intact models "in front of their eyes." The church of the "Prince of the Apostles," for example, displays an abundance of spoils: "columns, bases, capitals, architraves, cornices, doors and other incrustations and ornaments." This building, and three other similar examples, are all viewed with a restrained admiration, and the reader is thus surprised to be told next that "after the departure of Constantine ... architecture continued to go from bad to worse," for no "bad" has yet actually been textually figured. As an example of the "worse" Vasari tries to make Santa Maria Maggiore fit the bill but, having admired its spoils and good proportions, he can only direct our attention to its badly designed, stuccoed and painted frieze and to unspecified molte altre cose, all of which, Vasari acknowledges, demonstrate not the decline of architecture but of sculpture and painting. Yet he assures us that, with his next example, we are going to see a building made "in a manner so much worse than those cited above." And so it goes, the buildings pulling one way, the story another, until at the end, just before the narrative is rescued and put firmly back on track by the deus ex machina arrival of rampaging barbarians, we return virtually to the beginning: "as architecture had lost less of its perfection than the other arts, one could still see in it something good."77 The postdestruction narrative of medieval architecture is even harder for Vasari to manage. Now he desires progress, but also wants this progress to be glacial virtually to the point of stasis. Caught between these contradictory narrative impulses of motion and inertia are the figured buildings, which?particularly in the post-Carol ingian period?generate their own independent trajectory that escapes and goes far beyond that strand of the narrative that is sympathetic to them. The builders who so quickly replace the maniera tedesca in the early fifth century seem to give architecture a real upward boost, for not only were they "better craftsmen" in possession of a "better form" but? as the remarkable phrase inserted to the 1568 edition tells us?their better form was "somewhat similar to the buona antica."78 The suggestion that they have thereby reanimated good architecture itself is soon quashed, however, for their buildings, seen throughout Italy and in France, although "grand and magnificent," are at first 76. For similar struggles between unruly buildings and narrative structures in more recent architectural history, see Sankovitch (note 56): 695-701. 77. Vasari, Vite (1568), vol. 2, pp. 14-16: "aveva minor danno ricevuto I'architettura che I'altre arti del disegno fatto non avevano"; "L'architettura ... s'and? mantenendo, se non cos? perfetta, in miglior modo; n? di ci? ? da maravigliarsi, perch? facendosi gl'edifizii grandi quasi tutti di spoglie, era facile agli architetti nel fare i nuovi imitare in gran parte i vecchi che sempre avevano dinanzi agl'occhi"; "di colonne, di base, di capitegli, d'architravi, cornici, porte et altre incrostature et ornamenti"; "Dopo la partita di Gostantino . . . ando sempre ... l'architettura di male in peggio"; "... di tanto peggior maniera che i sopradetti"; "meno aveva della sua perfezzione l'architettura che l'altre arti perduto, vi se vedeva qualche cosa di buono." 78.

Its columns "have much grace and are formed with a beautiful misura/r The capitals and arches of the church are also praised and Vasari claims that the building is of such quality that it even served as a model for Brunelleschi. At the same time, however, he introduces Santi Apostoli by telling us that, after the "most ugly and disordered manner," architecture "improved a little."80 Yet the beautiful and well proportioned church itself, which Vasari offers as an exemplum of this slight improvement, manifests in fact not a little but a major advance over the "most ugly and disordered manner." Vasari certainly figures great progress at Santi Apostoli, yet he also seeks to rein back its momentum as if he had not really seen it there. The narrative is dragged back with greater insistence as Vasari moves on to San Marco and other Venetian buildings, which are said to display the same sort of positive progress as did Santi Apostoli; yet when their maniera greca is imported to Tuscany, the buildings it produces there demonstrate neither further improvements nor even a stationary continuation of the Venetian advances but a precipitous decline: "architecture was still in a measure holding its own, although greatly degenerated and very unlike the buona maniera antica."8^ Whereas in the fifth century architecture was "somewhat similar to the buona antica," by the tenth it is far removed from this ideal, despite the progress made in the intervening years. As Vasari moves into the eleventh century, a smooth patch of relatively easy and steady ascent brings the history and buildings into comfortable alignment. In 1013 "the art [of architecture] had regained some of its vigor" as the exemplum of the facade of the bellissima San Miniato proves with its columns, arches, and cornices that "strove to imitate the good ancient order."82 From then on architecture (as well as the other arts that had long lain dormant) makes steady progress, first at the Duomo of Pisa whose many spoils? "columns, bases, capitals, and cornices"?are all arranged with the greatest judgment and care by Buschetto, as are the newly made columns of its facade.83 Pisa, having picked up the impetus from San Miniato, in fact proves to be a real turning point, for "throughout all of Italy and above all in Tuscany it inspired many to beautiful enterprises," such as San Paolo in Pistoia, the baptistery in Pisa, San Martino in Lucca, and "many other buildings that would take too long to mention here."84 All these projects are seen with an amiable eye and often with the greatest admiration. That architecture has greatly improved since its miserable downfall so many centuries ago seems more than clear. Without warning or reason, however, the narrative suddenly veers in a completely different direction as the architectural history concludes: Similar to these were most, in fact all, of the buildings that were made in Italy from the times mentioned above to the year 1250, for little or no gain or improvement can be seen to have been made over the course of so many years by architecture, which remained within the same limits and continued to go on in that clumsy manner, of which many examples can still be seen.85 Later medieval architecture?for all its beautiful columns, good proportions, imitation of the ancient orders, and so on?is jerked back abruptly to its fifth century "clumsy" condition. The erratic zigzagging progress manifest in Vasari's many exempla from the fifth century on (or from the eleventh century on, it not being 79.

But to continue to read the medieval architectural history of the Proemio in the metaphorical terms presented above (motion and inertia with the buildings trapped between them) is to impose a coherence on the text?a complex and nuanced coherence to be sure?that still cannot fit and grants far too much logic to this splintered history and its disconnected objects.86 Vasari has too much invested in his metaphorical structure of decline, death, and rebirth to abandon it (or to compromise it with mixed metaphors that would dissipate its authority), nor can he drop the built objects that should both generate and demonstrate the veracity of this structure. The ancient buildings won't, however, submit to the plot's necessary decline, while the medieval buildings reject utterly the repetitive lethargy of a progress confined between the narrowest of margins. In other words, with an assertive, physical vigor beyond Vasari's control, the objects resist art history. But this insight of the 1568 Vite is complicated by another. For if the objects, the material built things, are in inevitable conflict with the desire to arrange them in a narrative sequence, Vasari's tortured history further reveals that classical architecture itself does not have the natural life cycle he would like it to have. From the time of Constantine on, the history of architecture is littered with classical spoils and with newly manufactured columns, capitals, bases, architraves, arches, and all the stigmata of the buona maniera. In fact virtually all Vasari actually describes are these antique elements. The buildings as complex wholes recede from view and what is figured in the foreground are the discrete morphological traits of the buona maniera, even in the case of those early post-man/era tedesca architects who discovered a "better form" that was "somewhat similar to the buona antica." Thus classical architecture, the buona maniera antica itself, just like its antithetical maniera tedesca, is a strange uncanny being that cannot be killed and will not die when it should. It perversely enjoys an unwholesome afterlife, unnaturally flourishing in the very period of its supposed death, in the time before it is to be divinely resurrected by Brunelleschi and his followers.87 Panofsky's observation that Vasari saw the Gothic "as alien and contemptible" can be reworked: what is contemptible is not the Gothic, but medieval architecture; yet it is contemptible not because it is alien but because it is familiarly, if uncannily, classical. Thus becomes apparent the great tension and paradox of the Vite and Vasari's fatal insight from which he and art history must blindly recoil.88 Having transformed Petrarchan loss and disjunction into a positive and necessary condition for rinascita, if that loss is lost to Vasari so too is the rinascita. If he abandons his story and follows where the buildings take him, there can be no rebirth, nor can there be an art history, a story of art. But if he remains?as he in fact does?committed to his story and its controlling metaphors of death and rebirth (in which art and the buona maniera are granted life and agency), then he obliges a reading of the maniera tedesca as a similarly anthropomorphic entity that lives on in the rinascita. This observation has its own consequences, for if we perceive the strange life of the maniera tedesca only because it is juxtaposed and opposed to the normal life of the buona maniera, conversely, we only see the unnatural life of the buona maniera because the maniera tedesca reveals such a possibility to us. The buona maniera and the maniera tedesca mutually and symmetrically affirm that architecture is not bound to the sequential structure of tightly sealed period-style compartments; it cannot be comprehended by the plots Vasari wished to transcribe within the compartments nor accommodated to the ruptures he sought to plant between them. This confusion and disorder then is where Vasari's desire "to see and understand many things which had not previously come to my attention" has led him. Nor was it seeing alone that fissured and tore his structure, but writing, the writing of the first comprehensive history of art, a history of art that for the first time attempted a real, detailed narrative of medieval architecture. 86. The prefatory narrative in the Life of Arnolfo only covers the time between the mid-twelfth century and the arrival of Arnolfo and is thus somewhat less conflicted. Nevertheless, on the one hand Vasari charts incremental progress (1152: "cominciarono pure a nascere alcuni di spirito pi? elevato," 1174: "un poco migliore maniera"), while on the other he writes of the contemporaries of Arnolfo and his father "non posso se non maravigliarmi della goffezza e poco disiderio di gloria degl'uomini di quelTet?." Vasari, Vite (1568), vol. 2, pp. 47-48. 87. It is also significant that Vasari does not trace for pre-decline ancient architecture the same three-part progress that he does for ancient painting and sculpture in the Proemio of the seconda et?. 88.

Or do the particular qualities of architecture designate it as only the most visible symptom of an affliction that, if we were to examine further, would be seen to have deformed the Vite as a whole? Is architecture a removable occlusion or the surface sign of a deeper and wider corruption? These questions, raised by Ranofsky's very pertinent reading, were not pursued by him, however, for a principal aim of Renaissance and Renascences was not to undermine but to shore up Vasari's epistemic model of sequential and self-enclosed period styles?what Ranofsky calls the "megaperiods" of classical, medieval, and Renaissance?and to reaffirm the unique and triumphant status of the rinascita?which he dubbed the "real," "total and permanent" "Renaissance with a capital /?."90 Such damage control was rendered urgent by a growing body of early twentieth-century scholarship that charted the widespread appearance of antique culture in the Middle Ages and thus threatened to expose the myth of the medieval and destroy the integrity and singularity of the Renaissance. This scholarship produced books with titles such as The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century9^ and advanced such claims as "There is no dividing line between 'medieval' and 'Renaissance' cultures."92 Ranofsky sought to regain the "perspective distance" he attributed to Vasari and from there to redraw the dividing line for the history of art with a solution that would account for the antique in the medieval while also retaining the superior and distinctive character of the Renaissance. In his famous and elegant formulation?the most original and influential fix ever wrought upon Vasari's paradigm?the small r "renascences" of the "high and later middle ages" were characterized by a "principle of disjunction" according to which a work of art was either classical in form but aclassical in content or aclassical in form but classical in content (a principle perhaps only apprehensible to the great iconologist whose business was the separation of form and content).93 Thus, for example, the Christian subject matter of the Reims Visitation group is disjunctive with the classical form of its two protagonists. Only in the "real" Renaissance were form and content reintegrated. Where does the principle of disjunction leave the architecture of the "high and later middle ages?" With the exception of a passing reference to "tubular shafts" (i.e., colonnettes), French architecture from the twelfth century onward?that is, that most quintessential of all "medieval" architectures known as "Gothic"?is completely absent from P?nofsky's discussion.94 Yet, at the very least Ranofsky, of all people, knew that Abbot Suger wrote about transporting marble columns from the Baths of Diocletian to Saint-Denis if no quarry could be found nearby to provide monoliths for his new construction (fig. 4).95 The point of Suger's text is not only that he esteemed the architecture of Roman 89. Ranofsky, Renaissance and Renascences, pp. 31-33. 90. Ibid., pp. 3, 8, 106, 107. Like Vasari, Ranofsky offers an anthropomorphic metaphor to sustain the concept of periods and period styles: "A period?and this applies to 'megaperiods' as well as to the shorter ones?may be said to possess a 'physiognomy' no less definite, though no less difficult to describe in a satisfactory manner, than a human individual. There can be legitimate disagreement as to when a human individual comes into being ... when he comes to an end . . . when he begins to be a boy rather than an infant, an adult rather than a boy .. . Yet, when we meet him at a given moment... we shall not fail... to form an impression of his total and unique personality" (p. 4). 91.

Even in the fifteenth century, which is dominated by the acolumnar and abstract interiors of the Flamboyant, a parallel architectural current reengages the column as it had been morphologically and typologically reworked in the thirteenth century, designating these column typologies as culturally legible representations of the great cathedrals (fig. 7). What I want to stress, however, is not the additional meanings borne by the column as it is made and remade in these centuries. Necessary as the study of the particular and historically contingent nature of such meanings may be, we should not overlook that the carving of blocks of stone into a column?into a shape that signifies "column"?is itself particular and even arbitrary and thus meaningful. As Pliny first recognized, the addition of a base and capital to a shaft was far from natural or self-evident but was a historically specific innovation whose origins are thus worth noting.99 Equally noteworthy is the continued shaping of architectural members not only into the base-shaft capital sequence, but also into Attic-derived water holding bases, round shafts, and Corinthian-derived antiquity, or that he saw it as meaningfully connected with his project, but that the new columns, which were eventually fabricated from the divinely provided local quarry, were interchangeable with antique spoils. As he put it, "we endeavored to learn where we might obtain marble columns or columns the equivalent thereof/'96 Once the quarry at Pontoise was discovered, the Roman plan was abandoned. Formally and semantically the newly fabricated columns and the ancient ones were the same. In other words, with De consecratione?a text translated by Ranofsky?Suger made explicit that in the building long positioned as the inauguratory work of the Gothic, a classical form?the column?embodied a classical meaning: the column. Furthermore, the column as column appears not only at Suger's Saint-Denis or in the limited group of other buildings that have recently come to be assigned to a kind of Capetian architectural Renaissance of the twelfth century.97 Although varying in degree of mimetic fidelity 96.

On the wider proliferation of columns from the eleventh century on, see Anne-Marie Sankovitch, "A Reconsideration of French Renaissance Church Architecture," in L'?glise dans l'architecture de la Renaissance, ed. Jean Guillaume (Paris: Picard, 1995), pp. 164-65; Trachtenberg (see note 95), p. 188; and idem in this issue of RES. 99. "It was in the earlier temple of Diana at Ephesus that columns were for the first time mounted on moulded bases and crowned with capitals, and it was decided ... that the height of the moulded bases should be one-half of the lower diameter [of the column]"; Pliny, Natural History, bks. 36-37, trans. D. E. Eichholz, Loeb Classical Library (Cambridge Mass: Harvard University Press, 1962), 36.179. Pliny's origin story was reiterated in the Renaissance by such writers as Manetti (see note 32), p. 58; and Philibert Delorme, Le premier tome de l'architecture (Paris: Federic Morel, 1567), p. 130v. Manetti in fact sees this tripartite invention?rather than any morphological detailing of its components?as the first step towards obtaining order in architecture. The subject of the column as object in relation to the orders as idea will be addressed in a future study.</page><page sequence="20">48 RES 40 AUTUMN 2001 Figure 5.

That is, when we look at the Gothic again we see what Vasari wrote despite himself: once forms are made they have a long and often mutable afterlife and are not constrained to their period of origin.100 Whatever secondary meanings accrete around the column as it is passed from hand to hand, picked up, reshaped and refigured, set in new arrangements and next to forms invented in other times and places, it always remains and signifies a column. That Ranofsky could not see Gothic columns as columns, classical in origin and formal meaning, that he was deaf to Suger, and that as one of Vasari's strongest readers he nevertheless fundamentally misread him is, of course, all of a piece. At the same time, however, it can be argued that Ranofsky understood Vasari far too well, comprehending that the myth of the medieval and of a 100. Georges Didi-Huberman has recently proposed that Aby Warburg's Nachleben?which allows for, among other things, the "porosit? temporelle du Moyen ?ge, de la Renaissance et du Baroque"?should be reappraised as an alternate to the more lucid model of self-enclosed periods offered by Ranofsky. Georges Didi Huberman, Devant le temps. Histoire de l'art et anachronisme des images (Paris: Minuit, 2000), p. 97. In the context of this essay, Didi Huberman's suggestion is of particular interest, for although Nachleben is normally rendered in art historical literature as "survival," in fact it is more accurately translated as "afterlife." Equally worth a second look then would be such studies as Adolph Goldschmidt, Das Nachleben der antiken Formen im Mittelalter (Vortr?ge der Bibliothek Warburg, I, 1921-1922).</page><page sequence="22">50 RES 40 AUTUMN 2001 rinascita depends on a history of art that does not look too closely at the maniera tedesca. If the maniera tedesca openly distorts the Vite by its presence, the Gothic compromises Renaissance and Renascences by its absence. Whether internally or externally seen, however, the flaws in both Vasari's and Ranofsky's texts should not lead us to the conclusion that sealed borders should simply be replaced by porous ones: Reims can never be mistaken for a first-century building; but then, neither can Saint Peter's (whether Sangallo's or Michelangelo's?or Constantine's). The real insight offered by Vasari is that architectural myths are not just written in ink, they are also written in stone.
