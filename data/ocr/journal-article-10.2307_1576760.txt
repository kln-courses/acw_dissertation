Clearly, the accompa- nying figures suggest the phenomenon of spreading or even proliferation [1]. This phenomenon is shown in Fig. 1 and, more evidently, in the four-fold Fig. 2, the sections or panels of which display consecutive phases of growth. As a matter of fact, any of the figures accompanying this article may be con- sidered as a frame or a quartet of frames from a complete film, which would place them in the field of kinetic art. According to George Rickey, the history of kinetic art be- gan in 1920 [2] when the brothers Naum Gabo and Antoine Pevsner not only claimed kinetic rhythms as the most impor- tant elements of art, but experienced them as the basic forms corresponding to the human sensitivity to time. Starting from these principles, Rickey developed his morphology of motion as a comprehensive theory of shape movement. Rickey cat- egorized the following categories of kinetic art: (1) optical phenomena, e.g. changing moire patterns; (2) transforma- tions, e.g. the mutation of objects in a picture as the viewer looks at it; (3) mobile objects whose parts viewers may often be allowed to influence; (4) machines, generally driven by motors; (5) variable light projection [3]; and (6) movement itself, caused by the most efficient mechanical means avail- able. To this last class, Rickey subsumed not only Calder's mo- biles but his own works [4]. Rickey himself never considered a kinetic art of growth. However, we can conceive such a category of art as a synthe- sis of Rickey's above-mentioned fourth and sixth groupings. In my search for this category, I am striving for a modification of Rickey's morphological position via the idea of morphogra- phy. Morphography entails investigating any visual sign with- out elevating its status to a work of art, in the spirit of the ini- tial sense of the Greek term aisthetikos as the exploration of the perception of the extant for its own sake. Thus, my goal is the observation of growth as such. At the same time, I fol- low the principle of unlimited aesthetification: everything can become an aesthetic object and, of course, a work of art as well. However, what should be understood as the intrinsic and creative heresy of morphography is this basic rule: The aesthetician or artist/scientist must make his or her stand via pictures called morphograms. Georg Nees (philosopher), Im Heuschlag 13, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany. Manuscript solicited by Herbert Franke. In other words, the true morphographer speaks chiefly by devising morphograms. He or she does so in order to minimize the vagueness inherent in every syllabic language [5]. Clearly, the intricacy of many morphograms makes the use of computers abso- lutely unavoidable. In this sense, this article deals simply with a computer-aided exercise in mo- tion-oriented morphography [6]. AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS ABSTRACT The author considers sys- tems capable of growth within the framework of the aesthetics of ki- netic art and George Rickey's morphology of movement. He ex- plains fundamental growth types as the kinetic aspects of a class of structurally coupled autono- mous systems. Two paradigms are treated with examples: the settling of clans competing for space and the concurrent sprout- ing of up to three plants. The au- thor uses and explains his method of morphography, which generally requires of the artistically inclined scientist the design and usage of computer-generated figures called morphograms. AND THE MOTIVE OF SIMPLICITY Rickey's theory of kinetic art remains a useful concept today, more so because many objects from individual morphological classes have proven to be computerizable. Autonomous sys- Fig. 1. The entirety of the small panes represents the settlement of a clan. Each individual pane, representing one member of the clan, is linked to its predecessor by a small bar. The position of ev- ery member is calculated by a random-number generator. How- ever, each member's incorporation into the clan is determined by rules of behavior. As a result, growth manifests itself in the spreading of a branching settlement.

The phenomena of structural coupling and competition are nec- essary consequents of system autonomy. The accompanying figures show morphograms that resemble vegetal growth. Is one entitled to include ex- tremely simple as well as highly complex organizations of this type with autono- mous systems? Any farmer enraged by rampant poppy growth in his or her corn- field would probably answer positively. Because this kind of discourse necessi- tates stringent concepts, we must now introduce some basic definitions. At first, every system S must fulfill the fol- lowing conditions: 1. S is made up of one or more parts. 2. Every part of S may itself possess parts that are in turn also parts of S. 3. Relationships may exist between parts of S. In addition, I define a structure as a rep- resentation of the construction of a cer- tain system S from the parts and internal relationships of S. The following definition represents a refined understanding of autonomous systems: 1. Every autonomous system A is also a general system. 2. The behavior of A follows a set of rules. 3. Some autonomous systems retain a data memory. From this explication we may draw the following conclusion: when using the storage space of a suitable computer CA as the host for the memory of an au- i m i tonomous system A, and if one more- over describes the behavioral rules of A via a program that suits CA, then CA is, in principle, able to simulate A. Although I will avoid formal lan- guages in my description of simulation processes, I will nevertheless try to apply as rigorous a diction as possible. The for- mulations I choose are fundamentally independent of the growth processes found, for example, in biology, even if I use botanical terms. Indeed, these growth scenarios apply not only to as- semblages of cells, but also to zoological and ethnic groups as well as buildings and cities. Moreover, the question re- mains: What are the most primitive be- havioral rules possible on which autono- mous systems capable of growth can be based? This problem characterizes a ma- jor motivation for the present study. THE GROWTH PRINCIPLE OF SETTLING The object in Fig. 1 is clearly recogniz- able as the representation of a particular autonomous system, providing one can find corresponding behavioral rules and, perhaps, a memory. The illustra- tion shows small, circular panes that ac- cumulate into chains, which in turn branch out in some places. I use an eth- nological metaphor in order to explain the formation of this system: Fig. 1 shows the settlement of one clan C, with each individual pane representing a member of C. As a result, growth turns itself out as the spreading of a settle- ment. New members are added con- stantly, like parachutists falling into the g: Q::/? ' Fig. 2.

The -.. -. :. .result is a three- pronged partition into subsystems. picture and landing in coincidental places, their ultimate positions calcu- lated by random-number generators. Hence, an elementary growth rule re- sults in the form of an instruction to an individual member: Only settle near one of your fellow clan members. However, this rule turns out to be too general. One will gain deeper insight by use of an anthropomorphic approach that lets one conceive the clan C as rep- resented by a certain system RI that op- erates by a complete set of rules: Rla: A group of members coalesces into a settlement. Rib: Potential members (applicants) land at coincidental places in the settlement area. Rlc: Any applicant F1 that does not land very close to a member FO that is already incorporated into clan C is re- fused. Rid: Any applicant that lands close to an incorporated member FO is linked automatically to FO. Rle: Members in clan Care thus incor- porated until a specific number is reached. From these rules several facts follow: the system R1 starts with a single growth germ or a small cluster of germs. In Fig. 2, only one germ can be discerned as a black dot at the center of the picture. Furthermore, Ri retains in its memory system the topographical data of each of its members. Finally, Rl is authorized to stop the growth process at any time. These details are translated into a com- puter language via the construction of a list of data from the memory. The com- puter looks up the list in cycles, thereby evaluating the behavioral rules step by step. This process can be displayed graphically on the computer screen. A closer investigation of Figs 1 and 2 reveals that every member now overlaps or touches no more than exactly one of its precursors, which definitely implies another autonomous growth system R2 different from Rl. This fact can be char- acterized by a modification of rule Rlc: R2c: Any applicant Fl that does not land very close to exactly one member FO that is already incorporated into clan Cis rejected. In Fig. 2, the growth germ constitutes the center of a three-pronged partition into subsystems. Certainly, the systems in Figs 1 and 2 present a branching that re- sults from the local admission of one or more new members close by a previous one. These "local qualities" generate the typical visual shape of the system as a 42 Nees, Growth, Structural Coupling and Competition in Kinetic Art ? . ..-, . -..- I .

The clans, or subsystems, are structurally coupled by the condition of keeping some dis- tance from one an- other. Subjective interpretations, e.g. observing a mutual interest of the clans in panel 3, to be substantiated by the spectator. ICd whole and present a prototypical case of the evolution of global visual features from local particularity [8]. STRUCTURAL COUPLING More interesting than the behavior of an individual autonomous system is the cooperation of several of them. How would two different clans CO and Cl manage their coexistence if any one member could only belong to one clan? We may provide perhaps the simplest so- lution to this problem by slightly amend- ing our former universal growth rule: Only settle near a fellow clan member. By all means, keep away from foreign clans. "see," "feel" or otherwise locate mem- bers in its area. Of course, RI relates now to both clan CO and Cl with equal right. Hence, a ticklish problem arises: an arbi- ter or demiurge is now needed that would be responsible for the welfare of a fitting supersystem W that comprises both CO and Cl. We assign this demiurge (DEMI) the following obligations: Wl: To create the germ clusters for both clans CO and Cl and to begin populating them. W2: To allow both CO and Cl the op- tion to break off growth autonomously after reaching a certain size. Figures 3, 4 and 5 show that system Cl sometimes stops expanding after a number of propagation cycles while CO continues to propagate. This is due to their respective structures and behav- iors as controlled by their supersystem. To distinguish the systems with this dy- namic particularity, I use the concept of structural coupling, which I borrow from the research field of biological constructivism [9]. In doing so, one must keep in mind the immense dis- tance in complexity between my very el- ementary autonomous systems and those of biology, in which, for example, the mutual control of movement in a swarm of insects is a case of highly orga- nized structural coupling. Nevertheless, many dynamic attributes of almost all autonomous systems are re- ducible to structural coupling. Further- more, competition itself is an aspect of structural coupling, because no entity can compete with another without en- countering resistance. With regard to the generality of the meaning of "self-or- ganization," the applicability of this con- cept at least to our color illustration surely is not questionable. Figures 3 through 5 reflect results of the diligence of DEMI. Each panel of Fig. 3 shows on the lower left the germ of clan CO and on the upper right that of clan Cl. Emanating from the germs, the development of the shape of growth depends exclusively on both the clan's behavioral rules and chance as realized by random-number genera- tors. Although the course of progress is gradual, some spectators' sense of psychokinetic organization may lead to the following interpretation: The clans extend little by little; in panel 3 of Fig. 3, one could even read a mutual inter- Thus, these two clans would now com- pete for available space. If we retain the metaphor of applicants raining from the sky, then we should assume that appli- cants to both clans land with equal fre- quency. However, because both clans originate from specific germs according to rule Ria, the clans can prosper only if every newcomer can be accommodated in one of the two neatly separated settle- ment areas. This consideration leads to the following addition to behavioral rules Rla and R c: Rla2: A group of objects forms a settle- ment a safe distance away from foreign objects. Rlc2: Any applicant F1 is rejected un- less it lands very close to a clan mem- ber FO and not less than a certain dis- tance away from the other clan. One will realize immediately that the sys- tem RI must in some sense be able to Fig. 4. Settling of two clans as in Fig. 3, but starting from germs situated near each other. In both Figs 3 and 4, the distance each clan member must keep from members of foreign clans even- tually results in the formation of a separating canyon between the settle- ment areas of the two clans. Nees, Growth, Structural Coupling and Competition in Kinetic Art 43 '1*" -- - ----</page><page sequence="4">est of the clans. In panel 4, although clan CO contains more members than clan Cl, CO appears to hold out at rest as opposed to the more aggressive Cl. Although these subjective interpreta- tions depend on the sensibilities of the viewer, there is nevertheless a lesson to learn here: simple behavioral rules can improve the predictive abilities of some viewers, which would explain the com- mercial success of even unsophisticated computer games. Of course, DEMI it- self can be transformed into an interac- tive game by delegating the constella- tion of the germs to some players. In Fig. 4, the germs of the subsystems are closer together, and the resultant growth yields another interpretation- cooperation. What was suggested in Fig. 3 now becomes very clear: The re- spectful distance that each member keeps from its foreign counterparts fi- nally results in the formation of a can- yon between the settlement areas of the two clans. As Fig. 5 shows, this canyon can assume the shape of a ring. Inci- dentally, the course of events in Fig. 5 results from the existence of an addi- tional germ of clan Cl, visible in the lower left corner of panel 1. Panel 4 of this figure suggests an urbanistic inter- pretation: rather than a siege of clan CO by Cl, one can imagine a design of speculative architecture. Certainly, the tenacious output of a global canyon ge- stalt as the result of the concurrent growth of two clans, controlled by DEMI, appears to be a rather universal attribute of this kinetic type of process. Color Plate B No. 3 demonstrates a Fig. 5. Settling of two clans as in Figs 3 and 4. By intention- ally positioning the JBr r5-^ ~ germs and stopping [] c DSthe growth of one 1p J^ ff&amp; E clan, a demiurge can shape the separating J t~ g h canyon into a ring. _ _ __.... . . The picture may be interpreted as an ar- rangement of build- ings. link-up of two clans by bridge connec- tions across the canyon among several closely neighboring members. The in- terlocking, symbolized by red strokes, is caused in this case by a final action from DEMI based on its ability to access the system's memory. THE GROWTH PRINCIPLE OF SPROUTING Let us now move from the metaphor of the clan and its members to that of a plant and its sprouts, i.e. sprouting trees that eventually produce branches and boughs. In order to analyze the prin- ciple of sprouting in one of its simplest forms, let us consider Fig. 6. The picture contains homogenous elements that re- semble petals, which we may designate as sprouts. Prominently positioned near the center is a large primary sprout. This present example of a sprouting process entails that the primary or first-order sprout generates seven second-order sprouts, or "daughters," around itself. The figure depicts one of the second-or- der sprouts generating a complete set of seven third-order sprouts. However, with another second-order sprout the same course of events breaks off after the gen- eration of four daughters. This breaking off is by choice of some demiurge; the generation of ever tinier daughter- sprouts could continue for a very long time. However, nothing speaks concep- tually against the possibility of uniting all sprouts visible in Fig. 6 in one plant. Also useful is the notion of the growth front of these artificial plants, by which I mean the entirety of all sprouts of any order as representative of growth. In this sense, the first ring of seven daughters in Fig. 6 represents the first stage in the advance of the growth front. Our attempt to understand the plant in Fig. 6 as an autonomous system leads again to the question of adequate rules of behavior, especially in regards to the deterministic form of growth with plants, as opposed to the aleatoric growth of clans. The seven daughter-sprouts, in combination with the overall circular pattern, reflect an outstanding symmetri- cal quality in Fig. 6 as a whole. In order to grasp the laws of sprouting and the administration of the structure of plants, one can again use both the instruments Fig. 6. The sprout- ing of one plant. The picture shows homogenous ele- ments that resemble petals and are desig- nated as "sprouts." Prominently posi- tioned close to the center is a large pri- mary sprout. In this example, any first- ._ ^ ? order, or "mother," sprout can, even if it need not, gener- I ate seven second- order, or "daugh- ter," sprouts around itself. 44 Nees, Growth, Structural Coupling and Competition in Kinetic Art .

Note that rm represents the initial or momentary radius of the protective circle, as does rn; d equals the constant angular difference between two neighboring daughters; e represents the constant angle of displacement of the momentary growth front against the angle of the pre- ceding one. The data of the sprouts engaged in the growth process are handled by queues. of memory and list. However, one must distinguish the visual representation of a sprout from the sprout's role as an item in memory. The actual difficulty lies in finding an appropriate methodical rep- resentation of the growth front. A spe- cific list format, in the form of a queue, offers a solution to this problem. In a queue at a bank counter, we can refer to the position of the first in line as the head of the queue and that of the last as the tail. Since bank customers would more likely be arranged in sprouts rather than queues, we may characterize the prin- ciple of sprouting by the following im- perative rule: A clan member shall surface as a sprout by going to the head of the queue. The sprouting process can be ex- plained via the scheme in Fig. 7. As above, we may formulate the rules of growth anthropomorphically: GA: The queue Q is created by posi- tioning the germ sO at the head: Q= sO. GB: Five daughters of sO are incorpo- rated into Q, and supplied with geo- metrical data derived from their mother sO: Q= sO, sla, slb, sic, sld, sle. GC: The mother sO is dismissed from the queue: Q= sla, slb, sic, sld, sle. GD: Step GB is repeated to incorporate Fig. 8. An example of sprouting where the overlapping of sprouts does not oc- cur. This is an op- erative result of the following rule of ground suitability, a u or ground shun- ning: A sprout is manifested if and only if the ground is suitable. "Suitabil- ity" in this case means the absence of colors belonging to sprouts them- selves. five daughters s2aa to s2ae of sl into the queue: Q= sla, slb, slc, sld, sle, s2aa, s2ab, s2ac, s2ad, s2ae. GE: Each daughter is afforded five daughters via the equation: Q= sm ... sna, snb, snc, snd, sne where n = m + 1 and where the sprouts sna, snb, snc, snd and sne retain data memory derived from their mother sm, who is eventu- ally dismissed from the queue GF: The cyclical course of events ends when enough sprouts are visualized or a special condition B becomes true. In order to understand the concept of geometrical data used in the above rules, let us compare Figs 7 and 8. One will recognize in Fig. 8 the more schematic features of Fig. 7, which presents in its upper left corner a scheme of the pos- sible visual presentations of the sprouts in Fig. 8. We can easily determine a par- ticular symmetrical sprout design by specifying some of its coordinates and using distinct colors to designate its ex- ternal and internal components. From this scheme, the final shape of the sprout-as represented in the lower right of Fig. 7-is derived by multiplica- tion with two scale factors. A visualiza- tion of the stepwise emerging pattern of the plant as a whole begins with the ini- tial positioning of a germ. In Fig. 7, the germ is set at an angle of 90? from the horizontal axis. The really important val- ues begin with the radius rm of a protec- tive circle concentric to and encasing the germ. The value of the generation number m is equal to 1 in the case of the installation of the germ. We can also see the sprouting situation sketched in Fig. 7 as already representing a section or substructure of the sprouting genera- tions m up to m + 2. The initial circle ra- Nees, Growth, Structural Coupling and Competition in Kinetic Art 45 I _____</page><page sequence="6">dius rm or rl is complemented by a simi- larly constant factor fr that determines the change in radius from one genera- tion to the next. In Fig. 7, a value of 0.7 is assigned to fr. One may also choose a minimum radius that will automatically stop the growth process. Indeed, this is one of the special conditions B that are mentioned in rule GF. Furthermore, a constant factor fi is required to put the daughters in the front of growth relative to their mother sprout. The factual dis- tance between mother and daughter is then increased by multiplying fi with the current sprout radius rm. One more fac- tor needed is the angular difference d between two neighboring daughters, which remains constant from genera- tion to generation. Finally, erepresents a constant angle of displacement of the momentary growth front against the angle of the preceding one. In Fig. 7, the value of this angle is -30?. Figure 8 shows no overlapping of sprouts, an operative result of the fol- lowing rule of ground suitability or ground shunning, which can be considered a supplement to rules GC and GE: A sprout is created if and only if the ground is suitable. This rule is useful when the ground shows-or fails to show-specific colors, e.g. the colors of already manifested sprouts. One might say that a potential sprout carried along by a queue bears a cloak of invisibility. Fig. 9 presents a spe- cial case of ground shunning, namely the handling of obstacles. Panel 3 of this Fig. 9. The sprout- ing process can handle obstacles. This is accom- plished by ground shunning: Visualiza- tion is suppressed when coincidence 4^*~~ ~ with any color of an obstacle happens. Because the data of *4 1 a suppressed sprout is, nevertheless, present in its ad- k_A *L ministrating queue, s_ 4t "sneaking" beneath obstacles can occur, as panel 3 demon- strates. figure shows an individual sprout that has obviously been sneaking beneath the obstacle by using the above men- tioned cloak of invisibility. FORM AND SHAPE, PARADIGM AND METAPHOR Concurrent with the interaction of sev- eral structurally coupled clans is the sprouting of more than one plant on the same bed via the simultaneous adminis- tration of the complete set of queues as- signed to each of a set of plants. The next step is to influence the developing pattern of growth by a purposeful con- trol of the individual sprouting chances granted to each plant. This is done via the creation of a supersystem that I will call FORTUNA. We can let FORTUNA play the natural equivalent of a wheel of fortune with three variably sized sectors. If the wheel of fortune lands on the n-th sector, then the n-th plant is conceded exactly one full sprouting cycle through rules GB to GD. Fig. 10 shows the coop- eration-or contra-operation-of three different plants. In this case, each of the two plants growing from the corners was given a 30% chance, while the plant in the middle was given a 40% chance. Cer- tainly, the total shape depends not only on chance but also on the placement of the germs. One can perhaps say that the central plant masters the area. In the case of Fig. 11, three plants were granted equal chances. While the plant on the far left flourishes on its own, the other two seem to be locked in battle. Obviously, many of the figures in this article present patterns developed with care, each of which possess a singular character. Of course, the essential reason for my theoretical neglect of these indi- vidual-though pattern-supporting-fea- tures is that I have handled the pictures as morphograms (i.e. methodical enti- ties) in order to focus on investigating extremely primitive types of growth. The meaning of "morphography" as it applies here can be expressed by two rules: 1. Morphography puts form before ge- stalt; the topic itself is more important than any possible visual representation of the topic. Fig. 10. Competitive sprouting of three v O &lt; plants.

Competitive sprouting of three plants without ground shunning. The same chance is given to each of the plants. Surely, the picture encourages subjective reading. 2. Morphography searches for para- digms. For example, growth is a para- digm that, on one hand, subordinates itself to the greater paradigm of move- ment and, on the other, comprises such sub-paradigms as settling, sprout- ing and, presumably, many more. These static rules are meant to spur a striving towards essential generalizations of our topic. For example, we may con- ceive of primitive spreading systems that generate new subsystems both out of themselves and by use of formal ele- ments from their material, sensual and mental environment.
