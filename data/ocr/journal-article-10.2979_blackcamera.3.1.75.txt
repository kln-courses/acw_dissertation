<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> “Draggin’ the Chain”: Linking Civil Rights and African American  Representation in The Defiant Ones and   In the Heat of the Night Emma Hamilton and troy Saxby Abstract Discourse surrounding racial representation, particularly filmic representations of  African Americans, has been overwhelmingly couched in terms of stereotype. For  this reason, scholars have largely conceptualized African American representation  as an example of ahistorical and detrimental continuity. The central black charac- ter in The Defiant Ones, Cullen, tells fellow white prison escapee Jackson when he  trips that he is “draggin’ the chain” to their freedom, but to film and history schol- ars, the representation of African Americans is itself “draggin’ the chain,” present- ing blacks only as signifiers whose meaning is largely homogenous and whose  capacity to reflect the realities of black experiences is nonexistent. This paper aims  to engage and explore this discourse of stereotype and the representation of race  through a case study of two civil rights–era films starring Sidney Poitier: The Defi- ant Ones (Stanley Kramer, 1958) and In the Heat of the Night (Norman Jewison,  1967). In undertaking a comparative analysis of these two films it will be argued  that these racialized representations evolved over time in a historically contingent  manner that reflects directly upon, and is informed by, the changing nature of the  civil rights movement. When stereotypes are utilized they are not necessarily ahis- torical or of homogenized meaning; rather, a complex interplay of processes of sub- version and containment of white patriarchal (stereotypical) values is presented  that sits distinctly at odds with this notion. It is in examining this interplay, the  process through which stereotype is used and given meaning, that we can begin to  understand and deconstruct representations and construct new ones of greater  meaning. Emma Hamilton and Troy Saxby, “ ‘Draggin’ the Chain’: Linking Civil Rights and African  American Representation in The Defiant Ones and In the Heat of the Night,” Black Camera,  An International Film Journal, Vol. 3 No. 1 (Winter 2011), 75–95. </page> <page sequence="2"> 76 black camera 3:1 Introduction Traditionally, scholarly interest surrounding African American represen- tation has focused overwhelmingly on the notion of stereotype. In this  view, the capacity of mainstream media, particularly film, to present alter- native and complex depictions of African American characters is curtailed  by its commercial nature, which cyclically anticipates and reinforces white  audience’s hegemonic imagining of the racialized other. Thus, what re- mains is a disturbing continuity: an unchanged set of stereotypes, removed  from lived experience and historical reality.1 While this critical discourse  on stereotype is important and aids in cultural recovery and empower- ment, including attempts at establishing black cinema, an uncomplicated  focus on stereotype has helped to further cement the homogenized mean- ings of these very stereotypes and has obscured the actual processes by  which such stereotypes are communicated.2  Alternative discourse has made some steps to place stereotype within a  historical context, two notable examples being Marlon Rigg’s landmark doc- umentary Ethnic Notions (1987) and Jan Nederveen Pieterse’s White on  Black: Images of Africans and Blacks in Western Popular Culture. Ethnic No- tions, which examines the perpetuation of negative stereotypes of African  Americans over time, puts forward the argument that such stereotypes serve  important social functions, such as reconciling America’s contradictory no- tions of ideological equality in contrast to a reality of racial inequality. Such  images evolve over time in a historical fashion to suit the changing needs of  the dominant white patriarchy.3 Limited by the constraints of documentary  filmmaking this piece tends to focus on the effects of negative stereotypes  without considering the processes by which these stereotypes evolve or the  complex and contradictory nature of stereotypes, whereby such images can  be resisted, subverted, or interpreted in different ways by the audience. It also  tends to focus on images in the pre–civil rights era, without considering how  negative stereotypes survive and are perpetuated even in times of mass social  change.4 Pieterse extends this historicization of stereotype, undertaking a  comparative analysis of European and American images of African culture,  to suggest that the construction of stereotype is not unique to the United  States but rather is a Western phenomenon. However, these stereotypes do  evolve over time in a way that reflects the unique historical conditions and  social needs of a particular context.5 In undertaking a broad theoretical ap- proach to stereotype the author necessarily sidelines depth of analysis par- ticularly related to specific artefacts, a concept noted in the critiques of  Michael Pickering, Kenneth Vickery, and Winthrop Jordan.6 Interestingly,  Pieterse also marginalizes the idea of stereotypes being perpetuated during  the civil rights movement, indeed opening with the acknowledgement that:  </page> <page sequence="3"> Emma Ham i l t o n  a nd Tr o y  S a x b y / “ D r a g g i n ’  t h e  C h a i n ”  77 “since the rise of the American civil rights movement many stereotypes of  blacks are no longer acceptable in the United States and have vanished from  advertising and the media.”7 This is an interesting assertion as most would  argue that stereotypes of blacks have continued into the present day and, in- deed, regardless of this surely we can conceptualize the civil rights era as one  of seminal importance in representation studies as it provides unique insight  into the interplay between processes of subversion and containment of  change and how, during periods of mass social upheaval, images can reflect  the concerns of image makers and evolve, rather than be stymied, over time.  In addition to these texts a variety of cultural studies have examined the rep- resentation of African Americans in films, exploring the capacity or desir- ability of accurate black representation(s) and the viability of black cinema.8 This paper undertakes a comparative filmic study of two civil rights– era films, The Defiant Ones (Stanley Kramer, 1958) and In the Heat of the  Night (Norman Jewison, 1967), with two major objectives. First, the paper  proposes a shift away from traditional discourse that equates stereotype  with continuity to an examination of stereotype as historical as well as the  specific processes by which race is communicated on-screen. In so doing it  is evident that representation functions in a more complex and contested  way, opening up a multiplicity of meanings for the audience and a multi- plicity of ways in which racialized portrayals both subvert and are con- tained by white patriarchal structures. Second, this analysis will establish  the way these representations are historically contingent, using similar  and recognizable themes to convey different messages over time. Examin- ing films produced during the civil rights movement highlights the impor- tance of examining the implementation and evolution of stereotypes  during periods typically associated with liberalizing and positive change.  By looking beneath the surface of stereotypes to examine the changing  strategies by which they are deployed and the often contradictory mean- ings they convey, the veil of seeming dehistoricization surrounding racial  representation will be lifted to reveal the historically contingent nature of  representation over time. Both films feature Sidney Poitier in a leading role and as the only central  African American character. First, in an unsubtle historical parable, The De- fiant Ones depicts Noah Cullen (Sidney Poitier) on the run after escaping  from a prison transport. The catch in his escape, however, is that he is chained  to prejudiced white inmate John “Joker” Jackson (Tony Curtis). The two es- capees must work together to ensure mutual freedom or else be recaptured  by the gaining posse. Although this theme of criminality is inverted, In the  Heat of the Night similarly sees Detective Virgil Tibbs (Poitier) teamed un- willingly with a bigoted police chief, Gillespie (Rod Steiger), in the hunt for  the murderer of a northern industrialist intending to invest in the small  </page> <page sequence="4"> 78 black camera 3:1 southern town in which the film is set. Although both films utilize similar  stereotypes and have narrative similarities, it will be argued that these are  used to convey very different messages regarding both ideas of race and the  capacity to resolve obstacles to racial equality. That is, on the one hand, The  Defiant Ones advocates the overthrow of racial discrimination through the  construction of a discourse of sameness that appeals to the similarity of ex- perience in economic and social spheres and the capacity to overcome rac- ism through personal change rather than institutional restructuring. On the  other hand, In the Heat of the Night explicitly rejects this, suggesting through  a discourse of difference that although interracial cooperation is possible, the  concept of a color-blind society, or the complete breakdown of segregationist  attitudes, is not. These fundamental racial messages are not ahistorical nor  do they represent stereotypes and continuity; rather, they accord with the  shifting historical context of the filmic release dates. This highlights how  Poitier, rather than portraying characters who were little more than the  modernized stereotype of “mild-mannered Toms” aspiring to whiteness,  presented a complex interplay of subversion and containment of this stereo- type, which reflects the historical context of production. 9 Historical context here suggests that both films reflect the evolution  of, and ideas within, the civil rights movement. Spurred on by the Brown v.  Board of Education decision in 1954, the movement strategically appealed  to the discourse of U.S. citizenship around personal morality and individ- ual freedoms, with the initial goal of legalistic reform to redress racism.  This progression countered fears of radical and ideologically incompatible  reforms to the American system, and, indeed, support of desegregation,  integration, and legal equality became a method with which to reaffirm  American citizenship values of individualism, democracy, and freedom.10  This strategy of appealing to sameness that embraces, rather than chal- lenges, dominant American values, is acknowledged, for example, in Dr.  King’s 1955 speech in the Holt Street Church, which both justified and  urged on the Montgomery bus boycott. King stated: We are here in a general sense because first and foremost we are American  citizens and we are determined to apply our citizenship to the fullness of its  meaning. We are here also because of our love for democracy...If we are  wrong, the Supreme Court of this nation is wrong. If we are wrong the Con- stitution of the United States is wrong.11 Over the next decade this strategy won significant victories in abolish- ing segregation in the southern United States and prompted federal legisla- tive change, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights  Act of 1965. Yet the coalition forged in the movement began to fracture  </page> <page sequence="5"> Emma Ham i l t o n  a nd Tr o y  S a x b y / “ D r a g g i n ’  t h e  C h a i n ”  79 after 1965 and the nonviolent approach was called into question. “We’re  only flesh,” John Lewis later observed, continuing, “I could understand  people not wanting to be beaten anymore . . . Black capacity to believe [that  a white person] would really open his heart, open his life to nonviolent ap- peal was running out.”12 Disillusionment with nonviolence was accompa- nied by growing skepticism toward integration, and the new discourse of  difference was duly acknowledged in films such as In the Heat of the Night.  The connection between African American representation and his- torical change will be examined in these two films in relation to three fun- damental and overlapping elements: first, the intimate buddy relationship  at the center of each film, where stereotypes such as failed African Ameri- can male leadership and black self-sacrifice are utilized; second, the rela- tionship between the protagonists and broader social structures, which is  most obviously created through utilizing stereotypes of bigoted white  southern institutions in contrast to liberal northern ones (or their embodi- ment); and third, the connection between these divergent filmic messages  and historical context. This third element emphasizes the ways in which  racial films are profoundly intertextual and interpolated in the wider his- torical context of their production. They both change to reflect historical  context and, where stereotype and narrative similarities are deployed, they  convey different historical realities, not necessarily historical continuities.  “I Kept You from Pulling Me In”:  Negotiating Sameness and Difference in the Bromance The Defiant Ones makes an explicit appeal to sameness that accords with  its historical context, particularly through the “buddy relationship” be- tween Cullen and Jackson. This occurs through blatant textual means. For  example, when the white character Jackson reveals his personal history of  economic oppression through menial and underpaid labor, and as the nar- rative reveals the similar roads that have led both characters to resort to  violence and crime, the obvious intention is to expose a history of same- ness, especially the idea of shared suffering through their class location.  The self-conscious utilization of class as a fracturing element of racial iden- tity both in this film and In the Heat of the Night, although to different ef- fect, may in itself be seen as a significant step in exploring stereotype. This  is because, as Lemke asserts, depth of analysis into stereotype “would at- tend to the role played by class in structuring class antagonisms.”13 Indeed,  Poitier’s Cullen actively participates in this process of stripping pretension  to expose similarity by telling Jackson the reason for his imprisonment (as- sault on a debt collector who pulled a gun) and the existence of a wife and  </page> <page sequence="6"> 80 black camera 3:1 A discourse of sameness:  Cullen (Sidney Poitier, left)  and “Joker” Jackson (Tony  Curtis, right) travelling  through marshes in an  attempt to catch the  northbound train.

Courtesy of MGM child, thereby implicitly subscribing to the view that hegemonic and hier- archical social and economic structures have acted to oppress all people,  not only African Americans.14 However, Cullen’s engagement in this pro- cess is not as great as Jackson’s and the nature of Jackson’s revelations— that suffering is shared regardless of racial background—conveys to a  predominantly white audience shared humanity and the need to stand  alongside black protestors. In contrast, In the Heat of the Night explicitly  rejects such calls for similarity and unity within the homosocial bond.15  This becomes apparent when the endings of the two films are compared.  The concluding scene of In the Heat of the Night could be interpreted as one  of racial reconciliation or at least mutual respect between the two police- men, and certainly the ending of a Hollywood production required a   degree of conflict resolution. Yet subtle facts work against such an interpre- tation. The scene is punctuated more by silence than dialogue, the charac- ters remain physically and noticeably separate rather than in contact, and  Tibbs never smiles until he is safely up on the train looking down on Gil- lespie, therefore creating ambiguity around the possible meanings of his  smile. This is a far cry from the conclusion to The Defiant Ones. In the ear- lier film the Poitier character jumps off the train, giving up his chance of  freedom to be with his new white friend, and the film closes with the two  </page> <page sequence="7"> Emma Ham i l t o n  a nd Tr o y  S a x b y / “ D r a g g i n ’  t h e  C h a i n ”  81 A discourse of difference: Tibbs (Poitier, left) and Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger, right) at the  conclusion of the film awaiting the train that will take Tibbs home.

Although these films both attempt to com- municate blatantly alternate messages of racial conciliation to the audi- ence, both utilize similar processes to communicate either a subversion or  containment of racial stereotype, with various effects. Both films explore  the perpetuation of stereotypes over time; complex, resistant, and multiple  uses of stereotypes; and, ultimately, the way in which these shared leitmo- tifs (stereotypes) suggest differing meanings over time. The foremost theme in the personal relationships of the protagonists is  competition and the personal struggle for power, which is symbolic of  broader political struggles for power. In both films the African American  character leads, although this is embodied in varying forms. This leadership  may be seen simultaneously as a strategy of containment and of rebellion.  On the one hand, this position of leadership places the black characters in  greater physical danger, with greater potential to fail, and, therefore, they are  arguably set up as foils to the successful action of other characters. This is, as  Helan Page notes in her examination of media control exerted over racial im- ages, a prominent strategy of containment. The strategy works by mediating  the audience gaze to cast judgment on African American men, while actually  protecting white men from true competition, and thus the potential destabi- lization of foundational ideas of white superiority that maintain racial hier- archy.16 In The Defiant Ones Cullen’s leadership is both intellectual and  </page> <page sequence="8"> 82 black camera 3:1 physical in nature: for example, he initiates their escape plan and is a source  of unique knowledge. Specifically, Cullen knows about the northbound train  running near their route, how to arrive at this point and, because of his agri- cultural background, how to avoid the physical dangers of the journey.  Moreover, Jackson is physically inferior throughout the film, disabled  through illness and subsequently a gunshot wound.17 Ultimately though,  Jackson consistently acts to assert his control: he saves Cullen from drown- ing, drags Cullen out of a pit, and when Cullen is tricked into following an  alternate route to his doom, Jackson pursues and warns him. This control  culminates in the ultimate sacrifice: even when they are not chained to- gether, Cullen forfeits his freedom to be with Jackson. In this sense racial  stereotype is deployed to serve a historical purpose: to comfort a majority  white audience in a time of mass change and social upheaval, but also, more  significantly, to politicize and inspire the majority white audience to be sym- pathetic and supportive at a time when the movement grappled with its reli- ance on white power structures to achieve successful outcomes.18 In the Heat of the Night employs a similar concept of contested leader- ship in a complex and often contradictory way. The film obviously uses  subversion of stereotype to dominate audience reception through the posi- tioning of Tibbs as a superior detective, who literally outclasses—in the  sense that he is a wealthier, northern city-dweller—and outthinks the local  police force to stay one step ahead and ultimately solve the case. In doing  this, Tibbs not only reveals his own indispensable ability, but also the in- competence of the town leaders who cannot even perform seemingly sim- ple tasks of policing, such as estimating time of death. The tale here is one  of black capability and even superiority to southern whites. Thus, Chief  Gillespie’s economic and social inferiority is an explicitly acknowledged  fact; for example, he is less articulate and is denied the respect of his team.  He also embodies this inferiority: he consistently sweats, is less fit, and is  comparatively dishevelled. Nonetheless, subtle strategies of containment  constantly work against this interpretation and somewhat negate the po- tential departure this represents from stereotypically dependent black  characters. For example, although Tibbs violently strikes out against tan- gible forms of oppression, Gillespie physically saves Tibbs from the white  supremacist posse. Containment is also reinforced implicitly by constant  shots of Tibbs’s hands, a visual metaphor that usually indicates control;  however, in this instance physical control is exerted over objects typically  coded as weak and lesser such as Colbert’s corpse and his hysterical wife.  At the heart of this idea of containment, however, is the extent to which  the characters played by Sidney Poitier in these films, and played by Poitier  generally, can be considered as contained simply because they reinforce  white patriarchal values. Broadly, it is important to acknowledge the ongoing  </page> <page sequence="9"> Emma Ham i l t o n  a nd Tr o y  S a x b y / “ D r a g g i n ’  t h e  C h a i n ”  83 role played by casting in debates over representation. This specifically relates  to issues of literal casting, that is, the right to have representations of racial  minorities acted by people whose racial identity accords with that role, an  issue particularly prominent in films featuring indigenous Americans.19 The  additional issue here is the capacity for individual actors to subvert stereo- typical roles in a white-funded film industry.20 For some scholars Poitier  himself became a 1960s stereotype.21 “Super Sid” was typically a highly intel- ligent, well-dressed, well-mannered northern black man who always did  right and was therefore divorced from historical reality or true meaning.  Poitier is the actor that a majority white audience would be happy to, as the  famous film title suggests, have to dinner. The extent to which Poitier’s char- acters can be seen simply as stand-ins for a typically white role is central to  this discussion. Such an interpretation suggests that admitting African  American actors into white filmic spaces sacrifices a sense of African Ameri- can cultural authenticity, with black actors simply portraying “white charac- ters with black skins” and, in so doing, neutralizing the politicization of the  so-called racial message genre.22 In opposition, Benshoff argues in his discus- sion of the generic reinvention of blaxploitation horror films, that the placing  of African American characters within genres that were previously charac- terized by racial homogeneity or reinforcement of binary racial opposition is  inherently subversive and cannot be adequately contained, a view subscribed  to here. This admission explicitly demonstrates the previous exclusion and  hierarchical representation, and, therefore, genre is utilized for “more overtly  political goals, specifically, to critique the white power structure.”23  Indeed, both films under discussion here address and reject the idea of  the black character as simply a stand-in for a typically white role. The Defiant  Ones displays this through an inversion of blackface, when Cullen and Jack- son attempt to break into a settlement town at night. Here Cullen problema- tizes Jackson’s skin color as being too visible, instructing him to smear  himself with mud. This may be seen as an example of “self-directed stereo- type,” a term used by Margolis to describe the tactic of stereotyped groups  using these very images as tools to undermine them and expose the racist  ideology upon which they rest.24 Following this, the reappropriation of  blackface proffers two fundamentally subversive ideas: first, that whiteness  in itself does not create advantage; indeed, to argue that it does endorses a  racial stereotype on whiteness itself. Second, and more importantly, it aims  to convey the constructed nature of race and specify that the boundaries sep- arating groups are not rigid and impermeable but malleable and porous:  even the act of lynching itself is not seen here as expressly racialized, with the  white Jackson under threat. In the Heat of the Night, however, rigorously re- inforces these boundaries, in that each character is able to enter an exclusive  space: for Tibbs it is the home of a female African American abortionist  </page> <page sequence="10"> 84 black camera 3:1 “where Whitey isn’t allowed,” and for Gillespie, it is the free exchange with  radical supremacist groups, reinforcing the discourse of difference advo- cated by the film. Ultimately, in presenting concepts of integration, the maintenance of  existing social institutions, and an overly positivistic message of interracial  friendship, The Defiant Ones reflects and attempts to impact broader histori- cal ideas. This process is twofold: first, this message reflects the aims of the  civil rights movement at this time. The focus was on legalistic goals such as  voter registration, education, and transportation desegregation achieved  through a philosophy of moral persuasion and a belief in integration and in- clusiveness. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peo- ple (NAACP ) had long pursued the tactics of persuasion and legal action to  achieve integration, yet King emerged from the Montgomery bus boycott  demonstrating an unparalleled ability to inspire black and white audiences.  King played on white guilt for failing to live up to Christian and democratic  ideals, but also offered them redemption through support for nonviolent  protest.25 Second, the limitations of this portrayal in terms of the subscrip- tion to stereotypical values and containment of subversion may also be seen  as an attempt to soothe white anxieties through emphasis on gradual and  personal, rather than radical and institutional, change. King’s appeal was  fundamentally based on an appeal to sameness founded on citizenship and  shared humanity.26 However, by the release date of In the Heat of the Night,  the civil rights movement had shifted to focus on differences and disparities  arising from the institutional enforcement of racism in both the South and  the North: King had launched his campaign against poverty, Stokely Carmi- chael had proclaimed Black Power, the worst wave of rioting in U.S. history  had occurred, and the commitment to nonviolence had splintered.27 In the  Heat of the Night reflects such historical development through its exploration  of institutional versus individual racism; the intersections between race,  class, and gender; sectional antagonism; and the way in which an emphasis  on difference impresses a long-term historical perspective. “No More Lonely Than You, I Suppose”:   Negotiating the Individual in Society  The relationship between the historical context of production and the politi- cization of racial representation is made explicit when the broader social  structures represented within these films are examined. In The Defiant Ones  broader social structures and attitudes are embodied in the pursuing posse  composed of lawmen and concerned (male) citizens. Here, the primary mes- sage of this relationship is that paternalism and encouragement of a dialogue  </page> <page sequence="11"> Emma Ham i l t o n  a nd Tr o y  S a x b y / “ D r a g g i n ’  t h e  C h a i n ”  85 of difference acts to fuel African American radicalization, while the encour- agement of color-blind treatment (sameness) creates a space for negotiation  of difference that leads to an acceptable compromise. This occurs most ex- plicitly in the juxtaposition of the relationship between the attack dogs and  their trainer, and the personal relationship between Cullen and Jackson.  That is, the consistent central framing of black dobermans by the camera,  and the sheriff’s continually expressed dual concern that the relationship be- tween trainer and animal is unnaturally tender—and also, most impor- tantly, that these animals will be unleashed and out-of-control—may both be  seen as highly symbolic. Specifically, through these techniques, the dogs are  constructed as an anthropomorphic conceptualization of black separatism  and the black buck stereotype: animalistic, physically strong, impulsive an- archists intent on social destruction who are shaped by the paternalistic  treatment of their trainer. Ultimately, the killer dobermans are not let off the  leash, however, and the film thereby rejects this paternalism and the idea of  destructive black separatism in favor of Jackson’s (and the sheriff’s) approach  to race relations: a dialogue of sameness that ensures that when Cullen is fi- nally let off the chain he remains internally bound to Jackson and, implicitly,  to the maintenance of broader and existing social structures. The film posi- tions the audience to perceive that the criteria for such internalized binding is  a sincere recognition of shared experience and mutual codependence, a fac- tor in itself problematic because it suggests that black and white experiences  are indeed similar and that levels of suffering are equal and ahistorical.28  However, there exists potential for subversion. This may be seen primar- ily in the implicit acknowledgement of white anxiety that exists embedded  within the portrayal of black rebellion: the dobermans do not simply track,  they kill, and the prospect of their release is a great and real fear conveyed  throughout the film. It also represents, on another level, the subversion of  stereotype: dogs themselves stand as powerful symbols of white oppression  and the physical enforcement of slavery, and the inversion of this may be seen  as a potent revision.29 Also, regardless of whether one engages with the idea  of subversion generally, it cannot fail to be acknowledged that stereotypes do  not simply work in one direction but, rather, white characters are also bound  within this. For example, the white dog trainer and most of the civilian posse  are portrayed as effeminate, comedic buffoons, mildly hysterical and con- stantly under physical threat. In this way, all people are stereotyped and es- sentialized within a racialized network, and the portrayal of the Other  reflects more on the values and assumptions of the hegemonic framework  that constructs such a stereotype than of those who are themselves stereo- typed.30 Ultimately the point here in examining the portrayal of broader so- cial structures, historically, is that the film constructs a narrative around  concepts of integration and sameness through the relationship between the  </page> <page sequence="12"> 86 black camera 3:1 two central protagonists and broader society; in so doing it argues that  “racism can be unlearned individual by individual. It has nothing to do  with economic and power relations.”31 Further, the film also constructs a  version of destructive black rebellion that instills in the audience the per- ception that the tactics and demands of the rest of the movement are a pref- erable compromise.32 In contrast, In the Heat of the Night constructs difference at every level  of the broader social network: racially, geographically, economically, and  culturally. Furthermore, the failure to overcome oppression resides not so  much with the individual but with structures that continue to enforce this  difference. Even within the African American community, this film iden- tifies class difference to note that progress for some is not progress for all.  This is best illustrated in the scene where Tibbs and Gillespie drive past  rows and rows of black cotton workers and Gillespie says to Tibbs, “None  of that for you, huh” while Tibbs intently watches the men and women pick  cotton. In this film, then, the emphasis is on the continuing struggle for  freedom from oppression and prejudice beyond individual or legalistic  frameworks. Thus, Tibbs represents a character constantly pushing against  the fabric of a racist society and in so doing, it may be argued, presenting a  departure from stereotype, particularly the shuffling Tom model of pas- sive acceptance. For example, Tibbs forces the recognition of his abilities  and dignity (as in the famous “They call me MISTER Tibbs” scene) and  literally hits back at white paternalism embodied by Endicott. And Endi- cott reflects upon historical change here: he remembers a time when a  black man would have been murdered for that action, but now the police  will not enforce a penalty against him.  There are, however, strategies that work to maintain an area of ambi- guity around the morality of typically racist scenes, most evident in mise- en-scène. Specifically, during the most explicit moments of white racism,  such as Tibbs’s initial arrest while doing nothing more than waiting for a  train and his physical confrontation with white supremacists, a subtle re- positioning of the audience occurs to negate outrage and empathy for this  character. In the first instance, this occurs through the backgrounding of  the arresting officer with a sign that prohibits loitering in the area, thereby  positioning the audience to accept that there is some justification for his  suspicion of Tibbs. In the second instance, when Tibbs is attempting to  ward off physical attack by white supremacists after being followed into an  abandoned railway yard, signage is prominently positioned above his head  stating: “Let Us ALL Be ALERT We Don’t Want ANYONE Hurt.” This is  highly ambiguous with a multiplicity of possible directorial intentions and  potential readings by the audience. This sign may imply, for example, that  Tibbs himself should have been more alert to his surroundings before  </page> <page sequence="13"> Emma Ham i l t o n  a nd Tr o y  S a x b y / “ D r a g g i n ’  t h e  C h a i n ”  87 entering an unpopulated area and that he, therefore, bears responsibility  for this attack; that the audience should be aware of the realities of racial  violence and that, in doing so, attacks will be prevented; or, alternatively,  that Gillespie, in proving himself alert enough to prevent this attack, pres- ents an ideal model of individual behavior. The implication of this ambi- guity is the blurring of accountability for racially motivated crime and  racial hatred generally, and the subsequent neutralizing of the audience’s  political and moral reactions. While this does not take away from the revi- sionist stance toward stereotype in this film, what is ultimately empha- sized here is that racism is institutionalized and, because of this, largely  invisible, and that despite individual efforts to overcome discrimination,  power rests outside of the individual realm.  In both of these films the role of gender performance and the intersec- tions between race and gender, as a reflection of broader institutional values  proves a complex addition to this assessment, requiring an incorporation of  different manifestations of patriarchal oppression and a context of emergent  women’s liberation movements by the auteurs. It may be argued that in both  these films, at a broader level of social relationships, women are framed as  neurotic, needy, and threatening to masculinity, and thus as directly opposi- tional to the central male characters. This allows the development of what  McCoy refers to as “masculine sameness,” whereby the factors that poten- tially destabilize a sense of social cohesion, such as race or class divisions, are  overcome through the maintenance of false gender difference.33 Cullen’s ref- erence to his wife, for instance, as encouraging him to accept mistreatment,  and as raising his son to live in fear, effectively emasculated, is seen as re- sponsible for black suffering over other structural or relational factors. Simi- larly, In the Heat of the Night places the responsibility for the death of the  industrialist on the promiscuity of the white Delores Purdy and the black fe- male abortionist, who holds the key to solving the case, but is portrayed as  more concerned with money than social justice or communal values. In the  Heat of the Night, however, is distinguished by an acknowledgement of an  intramasculine gender hierarchy that, although endorsing men’s superiority  over women, also supports men’s ability to oppress each other. Specifically,  when Gillespie allows Tibbs into his home at the end of the day they are  shown drinking alcohol and comparing the personal burdens of their police  work. This otherwise typical scene of male homosocial bonding soon dis- solves: Gillespie asks Tibbs whether he gets lonely and the response, “no  more lonely than you, I suppose,” reminds him that a truly equal relationship  cannot even be found in their gender. His reply reinforces that gender differ- ence impacts on and diminishes their masculine sameness: “don’t get smart  with me, black boy.” In so doing, historically, a discourse of difference is  maintained. Although the sole unifying factor for men across class and race  </page> <page sequence="14"> 88 black camera 3:1 lines in these films is their simultaneous desire for, and opposition to, the  feminine, this too is not an uncomplicated phenomenon but rather is histori- cally contingent and explored in different ways to reveal differing approaches  to racial discourse. Further, as Henry asserts, the maintenance of strict gen- der difference can be a paradoxical measure of manhood in this grouping of  films: the implication of this construction of the feminine as Other in repre- sentations of African American men has the potential, in the short-term, to  create a level of freedom and subversion of racial codes but, in the long term,  this contradictorily works to endorse the very patriarchal codes that main- tain the structures of racial oppression.34 “There Was a Time When I Could Have Had You Shot”:  Historical Change and Filmic Representation  The historical context in which each film was made clearly influenced and  reshaped the racial stereotypes used in both films. Indeed, the most obvi- ous plot difference between the two films, changing the central characters  from criminals to police, is only made plausible by events that occurred in  the years between the two films’ release dates. Quite simply, an escaped  convict was a plausible role for a black man in 1958, whereas an educated  senior detective was not. The audience never sees Cullen dressed other  than as a convict, unlike Joker, who changes clothes, and Cullen leads but  primarily in a physical sense, rather than through education, wealth, or  status. Senior Detective Virgil Tibbs, however, is portrayed as educated,  well dressed, and financially secure. This is not to suggest that opportuni- ties were widely available to all African Americans in 1967 or that African  American progress began and ended with the modern civil rights move- ment. Rather, audience acceptance of the Tibbs character, and the “Super  Sid” stereotype generally, was enhanced by recent historical developments.  Some of the civil rights movement’s most powerful images were of well- dressed and disciplined college-educated African Americans being abused  by white bigots.35 Not only was an educated, intelligent black man a far  more plausible mainstream representation in 1967, southern whites could  easily be cast as villains. More than a decade of extensively reported south- ern racial violence prepared audiences well for such a story.36  One of the most compelling shifts in representation between the two  films is the portrayal of the two police sheriffs. In The Defiant Ones Sheriff  Max Muller (Theodore Bikel) is the liberal ideal of authority. He is mea- sured in his pursuit and determined to avoid violence in recapturing the es- capees. At only one point does he lose his temper when he exclaims, “I didn’t  think it was possible, but I’m beginnin’ to hate those two men,” after a  </page> <page sequence="15"> Emma Ham i l t o n  a nd Tr o y  S a x b y / “ D r a g g i n ’  t h e  C h a i n ”  89 reporter reminded him that it was an election year. A strong allegory is being  made with the Little Rock crisis which occurred the year before the film’s   release. Little Rock garnered national and international media coverage   following the decision by Arkansas governor Orval Faubus to fight school  integration, largely to enhance his own re-election prospects.37 The Defiant  Ones mirrors these events by having a reporter accompany the posse and pe- riodically remind the sheriff that he is up for re-election and his handling of  the manhunt could determine his electoral fate. Sheriff Muller is a liberal  good guy and therefore does not resort to populist politics or bow to pressure  from state officials represented by the gung ho state trooper. This stands in  stark contrast to Sheriff Gillespie from In the Heat of the Night who is close to  explosion at every point. He holds Tibbs in contempt and bungles the case  badly, at one point arresting his own subordinate, another buffoon in a police  uniform, for the crime. The real murderer also happens to be a white fool,  though not a policeman. This divergence in the portrayal of police authority  in a race message film has obvious historical parallels. A decade of police  brutality directed toward nonviolent protestors had invalidated the idea of a  humane southern sheriff. Dr. King had made it a cornerstone of his nonvio- lent direct action protest to target regions under the jurisdiction of notori- ously short-tempered, racist police officials, such as Eugene “Bull” Connor in  Birmingham and Jim Clark in Selma.38 Just as an intelligent black homicide  detective had become a plausible character by 1967, an enlightened southern  sheriff had become implausible, and the stereotype of the ignorant southern  racist took precedence. The message from The Defiant Ones, that simply bringing people to- gether will force them to confront and overcome their prejudice, is also  abandoned in In the Heat of the Night, where bringing people together has  deadly consequences. As discussed, Tibbs is out of his familiar environ- ment and ignores, or fails to recognize, the warning signs. The civil rights  era is rife with examples of racialized violence against those who entered  unfamiliar surroundings, such as Emmett Till. The segregationist view of  such crimes was made explicit following the 1964 murders of civil rights  workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner.  “When people leave any section of the country and go into another section  looking for trouble,” said Mississippi Congressman Arthur Winstead,  “they usually find it.”39 The danger of interracial cooperation is evident in  the film when Gillespie saves Tibbs from the rednecks who label him a  “nigger lover.” Similar hate-filled sentiments no doubt flowed through the  veins of the killers of Viola Liuzzo, Goodman, Schwerner, and others. Fur- thermore, Schwerner’s wife Rita made a pertinent point when she com- mented on the investigation into the civil rights workers’ disappearance:  “We all know that this search with hundreds of sailors is because Andrew  </page> <page sequence="16"> 90 black camera 3:1 Goodman and my husband are white. If only Chaney was involved, noth- ing would’ve been done.”40 What gives the murder case in the film its im- portance is that the murder victim was a wealthy white northerner. The national attention given to the southern civil rights movement  during the period between the two films ensures that sectional antago- nisms, which are largely absent from The Defiant Ones, become a central  point of difference in In the Heat of the Night. The Defiant Ones makes ref- erence to the North–South divide when Cullen and Jackson briefly argue  over the direction of their flight. The dispute is quickly resolved, with both  Jackson and the audience quickly grasping the importance for Cullen to  escape to freedom in the North and the best way to do so: by railway, in  this case a literal one. Yet In the Heat of the Night positions regional differ- ence as a central source of tension. The murder victim is a northern white  industrialist, and his wife insists that Tibbs, a northern black man, be al- lowed to work the case. The murder of Emmett Till and the reporting of  the Little Rock crisis confirmed both the brutality of racism and the resis- tance of southern racists to outside interference. The freedom rides and  nearly nine hundred volunteers for the Mississippi Summer Project, most  from prestigious northeastern universities, reinvigorated the concept of  “uppity northern niggers” and radical white agitators invading the South  to stir up racial trouble.41 By the release of In the Heat of the Night audi- ences had been well prepared for this portrayal of a small town in the Deep  South and its bigoted citizenry. To the white racists portrayed in the film  Tibbs is an “uppity northern nigger,” while the murdered northern indus- trialist is a financier of progress and his wife, the outside agitator. More  significantly, to a northern white audience, the portrayal of sectional dy- namics serves to contain racism as a southern problem at a historical junc- ture when the focus of the black freedom struggle was actually shifting  from the South to northern ghettos, and white activists and money were  abandoning the struggle. In this way, too, the stereotype of southern rac- ism restricts the portrayal of white characters—both black and white char- acters lack complexity—and it reassures audiences that racism is contained  within a distinct sectional sphere rather than being an underlying problem  throughout American society. Thus, while this can be viewed on the one hand as a stereotypical rep- resentation of southern attitudes, it can also be understood as a deflection  of racial problems in the North that were being increasingly brought to  national and international attention. The foolish white southerner is de- ployed as a peripheral comedic character in The Defiant Ones; however, the  use of this stereotype becomes central to the later film. The 1967 release of  In the Heat of the Night occurred at the height of the “long, hot summers,”  during which 250 African Americans died, eight thousand were wounded,  </page> <page sequence="17"> Emma Ham i l t o n  a nd Tr o y  S a x b y / “ D r a g g i n ’  t h e  C h a i n ”  91 and about fifty thousand were arrested in nearly three hundred race riots  between 1965 and 1968.42 King had failed in his 1966 bid to tackle de facto  segregated housing in Chicago and continued to lose influence throughout  1967 as he campaigned against the war in Vietnam. New leadership, in- spired by Malcolm X, emerged under the broad banner of Black Power,  which rejected integration and white coalitions. These developments re- sulted in a rapid decline in northern white participation and financial sup- port for the struggle. Therefore, it could be argued northern liberals were  willing to finance and watch a film that highlighted intractable southern  racism and glorified northern enlightenment; a film that saw a northern  industrialist who brought wealth and progress to the South brutally mur- dered; that has the victim’s wife, also from the North, insisting that a black  policeman, a product of northern opportunity, be allowed to work the case  despite the protests of southern rednecks. This interpretation is strength- ened by the filmmakers’ decision to alter the origins of several characters  from the original novel: Tibbs is changed from a Californian to a Pennsyl- vanian, the murder victim is changed from an Italian composer to a north- ern industrialist, and Endicott from a liberal philanthropist to the perfect  symbol of southern racism.43  The Defiant Ones, as noted, reiterates the strategic approach of civil  rights advocates who saw the struggle as a moral one. This interpretation was  thoroughly outlined in Gunnar Myrdal’s 1944 landmark study of American  race relations, An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern De- mocracy.44 Myrdal argued that there was a fundamental contradiction be- tween American core values and the treatment accorded African Americans,  and this contradiction could only be resolved through a struggle for the  white moral conscience. The Defiant Ones makes an obvious pitch to the  white moral conscience to recognize the humanity of African Americans.  Furthermore, it also provides a filmic representation of alternative responses  to the American dilemma. The relationship between the two authority fig- ures, the local sheriff and the state trooper captain, presents two alternative  approaches to racial justice for the audience to evaluate. The sheriff is intent  on recapturing the men without violence while the state trooper wants them  recaptured at any cost. The alternative approaches are no doubt offered for  the audience to evaluate, but perhaps also to reflect recent events, in particu- lar the Little Rock school integration crisis in which different branches of  authority acted to impose their will. In Little Rock, the state governor’s defi- ance of federal authority inflamed racial prejudice. The snarling racists who  greeted the nine black students trying to enter Central High could easily rep- resent the snarling dogs hunting the escapees in The Defiant Ones. A similar  dilemma is played out when the escapees are briefly captured by the men of a  small town. One man, Mack (Claude Akins), is physically prevented from  </page> <page sequence="18"> 92 black camera 3:1 lynching the pair by Big Sam (Lon Chaney), who berates and dares the rest of  the “big men” watching on to try and murder the convicts. Like the sheriff,  he stands up against immorality and needless violence. The portrayal of dif- ference in this film, then, is not so much between black and white, but the  different attitudes whites can adopt toward racial justice and the potential  consequences of those choices.  This is in stark contrast to In the Heat of the Night where none of the  white townspeople speaks up for tolerance. The scene in which Tibbs ques- tions the white supremacist Endicott in the greenhouse bears some similari- ties to the lynching scene from The Defiant Ones. A restrained Cullen spits in  the face of a white supremacist, whereas Tibbs retaliates by immediately re- turning Endicott’s slap in the face. The key difference between these two acts  of defiance is that in the earlier film the black character is saved only by the  direct physical intervention of a white sympathizer whereas in the later film  Tibbs’s retaliation requires nobody to intervene on his behalf. It is bold, as- sertive defiance that ultimately exposes the weakness of the white suprema- cist. On the verge of tears, Endicott laments to Tibbs, “there was a time when  I could have had you shot.” The unrestrained power of white supremacy is in  decline—even the name Endicott is a play on the words “end of cotton.”  While Tibbs remains harassed by individual white supremacists, Endicott is  in far greater danger as his power has clearly eroded. By the late 1960s the  American economy had shifted from its traditional agricultural base, and  part of this shift resulted in the mechanization of cotton production, which  had been the primary economic activity of southern blacks since the Civil  War; subsequently, many African Americans migrated north and to urban  areas in search of new economic opportunities.45 Endicott’s traditional race  power is diminished by economic changes, such as the murder victim’s pro- posed factory, which is why Tibbs suspects him of the crime. Endicott’s  power is further diminished by the assertive action of blacks like Tibbs (pre- sumably a recent migrant to the North since he was only in Mississippi to  visit his mother) who have benefited from education and employment op- portunities and can now meet Endicott blow for blow. Tibbs quite literally  struck a blow against white supremacy and a blow against King’s nonvio- lence and the message of black self-sacrifice depicted in the final scene of The  Defiant Ones.  Conclusion Karen Ross argues in her analysis of race in the media that “no image is  other than a social construction viewed from a particular perspective and  situated in a particular historical moment.”46 It is argued here that although  </page> <page sequence="19"> Emma Ham i l t o n  a nd Tr o y  S a x b y / “ D r a g g i n ’  t h e  C h a i n ”  93 the concept of negative and ahistorical racial stereotypes has dominated  studies of African American representation, stereotypes can be deployed  in different ways, to serve different purposes and, in this way, are deeply  historical. This is not to say that stereotypes do not have a harmful effect on  their subjects; what is suggested here is that further analysis of the process  by which stereotypes are used and adapted to suit different circumstances  allows scholars to understand how they are perpetuated and, ultimately,  how more realistic images can be integrated into the media. The Defiant  Ones and In the Heat of the Night provide examples of the ways in which  similar stereotypes and narrative strategies can provide complex and often  contradictory examples of portrayals typically conceptualized within a  continuum of stereotypical representation. When examined in this com- plex way, these films, as case studies, illustrate the capacity of cinema to  reflect changing historical values, in this instance the evolving aims of the  civil rights movement from desegregation, integration, and appeals to per- sonal morality to examinations of institutional disadvantage, the rise of  black power, and issues of separatism.

It must be acknowledged that this disabling of a white character could be seen  as a reversal of the stereotype (the traditional disabling of African Americans) or an  adherence to it (by forcing the African American character to act as nurse, a role that  Cullen appears more than willing to assume, which could be seen as a “noble savage”  stereotype).
