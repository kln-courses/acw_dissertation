<plain_text><page sequence="1">Phytomorphic Representations of the Ancient Peruvians' CESAR VARGAS C.2 Introduction The representation of plant-motifs on vari- ous kinds of objects in Peru in pre-Colum- bian times reached enormous proportions and attained great authenticity of ex- pression. Through this medium, the ancient inhabitants of Peru set forth faithfully their knowledge of the relationships and uses of the plants with which they were surrounded. In some respects, the pantheistic religion of these people possibly influenced their use of plants as adornments. At least, some of the historians and chroniclers consider that this influence was real. Garcilaso Inca de la Vega, for example, wrote ". . . and thus they worship herbs, plants, flowers, trees of all kinds." Then. again, just as the natives of today who hail from the high Andes, the aneient Peruvians liked to dress themselves with the many beautiful flowers of their native flora. In their wonderful art the people of Peru expressed not only the ordinary uses but also the emotional appeal of their plants. These expressions were made manifest in a variety of obiects-objeets which still cause us to admire their accuracy and beauty-and myriads of phytomorphic representations in articles of clay (sculptured or paintedf), wood and textiles. Whatever medium was used, their manufacture was always of out- standing skill. As I wrote in a short article entitled "Algunas fitomorfias raras o critieas de los antiguos peruanos" (Bol. Soc. Arg. Bot. 2. 1947), Professor Fortunato L. Herrera of Cuzco, Peru, has investigated more or less profoundly diverse aspects of Peruvian ethnobotany. and I lean heavily on some of Herrera's published works. In this article, I shall deal exclusively with phytomorphic representations in different 1 Translated by Richard Evans Schultes. 2 Professor of Botany, Universidad Nacional del Cuzco, Cuzco, Peru. graphic media which I have observed and determined botanically. No attempt is here nade to consider what is available already in the literature, much of which, especially that found in the documents of the historians and chroniclers, may not be based on critical botanical work. I have tried to get together a large number of observations and data, but I am the first to confess that I have far from succeeded in covering the whole field. Some of the information which I have included in the following lines is entirely original with me, or the data are rare and poorly known, or else they deserve mention because, in earlier reports, they suffered from errone- ous botanical interpretation. Sources of Information The sources utilized in doeumentation and consultation have been the following: 1. Graphic: Ceramics or clay objects: dishes, pots and other* similar artifacts. Wooden pots and vases. Textiles and stone objects. This material was studied and photo- graphed by the writer in the Museo Nacional in Lima in 1938, when this institution was under the direction of Dr. L. E. Valcarcel. I express my gratitude to him for his kind collaboration which enabled me to obtain valuable notes and photographs. Later, I was able to study material in the Museo Arquelogico of the Universidad Nacional del Cuzco with the enthusiastic assistance of its director, Dr. Luis A. Pardo. Finally, I was fortunate enough to be able to examine the valuable private collection of Dr. Enrique Rosell, most of which was collected in the Provincia de Cotabambas, Departamento de Apurimae. 2. Bibliographic: for the most part, pro- fusely illustrated publications with drawings or photographs of phytomorphic objects. The principal works involved are: (a) "El rnundo vegetal de los antiguos peruianos" by E. Yacovleff and F. L. Herrera in Rev. Mus. 106</page><page sequence="2">PHYTOMORPHIC REPRESENTATIONS OF THE ANCIENT PERUVIANS 107 Nac. (Lima, 1934-35). (b) "El primer nuevo cronica y buen gobierno" by Phelipe GuamAn Poma de Ayala [new ed., A. Posnansky] (La Paz, 1944), in which there are pictur- esque drawings, sometimes grotesque, made by quill pen, and a reference in Quechua to the tomato. (c) "Ceramicas del antiguo Peru" in the Coleccion Wassermann San Blas (Buenos Aires, 1938), in which some 600 black and white photographs and many in color are reproduced. There are few plants depicted, most of the motifs being zoo- inorphic or anthropomorphic. All are from the coastal cultures. (d) "Kunstud Kultur von Peru" by Max Schmidt (1929), in which there are illustrated a number of ceramics with plant-motifs. Materials Used in Phytomorphic Representation The plant-m.tifs most often depicted are found in objects of: (a) clay (in vases imi- tating the form, usually in natural size, or with colored paintings of plants; (b) wood ("keros"), always with paintings; (c) tex- tiles (woven representations in bright colors); and (d) stone ("liticos") imitating the form, usually small, rarely of natural size. The clay objects are the most numerous, varied and true to life. They belong prima- rily to the coastal cultures and diminish in abundance in the highland cultures, Tiahuan- aco and Inca, in which the plant representa- tions are almost always painted. In the case of clay objects, considering the chronology based on conclusions of Prof. Max Uble, I point out that the Inca culture was preceded by three important cultures, two of which developed along the coast: one in the north in Trujillo, Valle de Chicama, and the other toward the south, in the Nasea region. The third culture of importance, purely Andean, is that of Tiahuanaco, which developed in the vicinity of Lake Titicaca. The ceramic objects of various coastal cul- tures are differentiated or characterized by their colors, the predominating color of the Chimui artifacts being black; the Proto- chimui was more varied in color: white, red, black, yellow. Finally, the coloring of the Nasca ceramic ware, considered to be the most ancient, was likewise varied, four or five colors being customarily employed. The ornamental motifs represent usually culti- vated plants or species having a practical use. The second group, or keros, consists of wooden pots and vases of varying dimen- sions, the largest being 25 cm. in height and 12-13 cm. in diameter. Small cups are also found. All of those discovered at this writing belong to the Inca culture. An interesting reference is found in the still little known but informative book of Guamfan de Ayala (p. 191) to "artisans who painted in quiro and in mate which they call cuscoc flimpico, or the lacquer with which wooden vessels are painted." According to my observations, the woods employed in the manufacture of such wooden pots and vessels belong to the following plant species common in the mesothermic valleys and in transition to the arid table land. In the order of their frequency, these are: Escallonia resinosa (R. et P.) Pers. (Saxifragaceae): "chachacoma," a reddish, brittle wood. Juglans neotropica Diels (Juglanda- ceae): "nogal," blackish, soft. Cedrela Herrerae Harms (Meliaceae): "cedro," of reddish color, soft fiber and with a peculiar, lasting odor. Eugenia oreophila Diels (Myrta- ceac): "unca," whitish, hard. The plant-motifs on sueb objects consist of paintings which adorn the exterior of the "keros" completely, in more or less natural colors, resembling enamel in those which are well preserved and retaining their brilliancy. The finish is admirable, and the imitation of nature perfect. Ornamental plants are usu- ally depicted, more rarely others. The third group, textiles, also belonging to the coastal cultures or to the Andean, less frequently show plant-motifs; and when they do occur, the representations are of plants common in the Andean flora and those which were much esteemed by the people. Finally, there are the stone objects, imi- tating cultivated products: potatoes, corn, etc. These are called "conopas" and were customarily placed in the fields on farms where those food crops were cultivated, so that the crops might be abundant. This ap- pears to have been purely an Andean custom, inasmuch as these amulets are rare in the coastal cultures. This article is illustrated with photographs</page><page sequence="3">108 EOONOMIC BOTANY 1 ~~~2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Fig. 1-9. taken by the author and drawings made from original objects, thanks to the valuable collaboration of my botanical assistant, Mr. Pompeyo Enriquez, to whom I am much indebted. Plant Material Represented The plant-motifs of the ancient Peruvians follow, in order of their use and frequency: A. Common plants. Those domesticated or introduced for their usefulness, or those. still growing wild. POTATOES-Solanum tuberosum L., subsp. andigenum Yuz. et Buk. In the ceramics of the Chimui culture, numerous artifacts are found, many vessels imitating the form of tubers of sundry varieties-round, flattish, oval, cylindrical, etc.-in some cases com- bined with animal-motifs, as many be noted in Fig. 1, 2 and 3. In the latter an abnor- mality is shown-a tuber with shoots. On clay objects of Tiahuanaeo origin are found ex- tremely accurate paintings of entire plants on larger vessels now in the Museo Nacional</page><page sequence="4">PHYTOMORPHIC REPRESENTATIONS OF THE ANCIENT PERUVIANS 109 de Lima. The tuber is also found on stone "conopas." Possibly these are of Inca origin. On vessels of Tiahuanaco origin are also found paintings similar to those of the potato, but representing somewhat stylized the following cultivated plants of the Andes. QuINuA-Chenopodium Quinoa Willd. (Chenopodiaceae). This plant, like the fore- going, is cultivated on the slopes and in the inter-Andean valleys for its edible seed, rich in nutritive substances and nowadays much esteemed. ULLUCO, LISAS-UllucUs tuberosus Lozano (Basellaceae). A creeping plant cultivated likewise for its tuberous roots, usually in high ravines more than 3500 meters in alti- tude. More than a dozen varieties or forms are known, differentiated mainly by the color of the tuber. MASHUA, AN U (in Queehua); ISARO (in Aymara6)-Tropaeolum tuberosum R. et P. (Tropaeolaceae). A twining plant cultivated at altitudes of over 3500 meters for its tubers rich in carbohydrates. There are varieties of different colors. OCA-Oxalis tuberosa Molina (Oxalida- ceae). Cultivated at the present time for its edible, cauline tubers, rich in starch, which may be eaten only after boiling. TARHUI-Lupinus mutabilis Sweet (Legu- minosae). An erect plant about 1.20 meters in height, having blue, rose and white flowers, the first color being most common, the others less frequent. The plant is cultivated at altitudes up to 3700 meters for its edible seeds. MAIZE, SARA (in Quechua), Zea Mays L. (Gramineae). Figures 4 and 5 illustrate corn fairly well in high relief and in the form of a vessel. In the latter case, the maize is "pearl" or "popcorn"; in Figure 6 there is shown an abnormality, "mama sara." These are all Nasca ceramics. On vessels of Mo- chica origin, there are paintings of the entire plant or plants combined with zoomorphic and anthropomorphic representations; agri- cultural labors are also found depicted. Stone representations or those called "conopas" are likewise found, chiefly in the sierras, in some instances in high relief. From what I have observed in well preserved specimens from Cotabambas and Apurimac in the Rosell collection, the work is even more detailed; kernels are attached to a cylindrical form, imitating an ear. Maize is depicted also in regular textiles of the Nasea culture. Concerning the name of this plant, Garcilaso describes it as "the grain which the Mexicans and Windward Islanders call maize and the Peruvians sara." YUCA, RUMU-Manihot esculenta Crantz. (Euphorbiaceae). The Chimui artist preferred to use the form of the roots on vessels, some- times singly, sonmetimes in bunches. The Nasea artisans likewise produced excellent representations of the roots of that plant (Fig. 7). This root, rich in starch and widely used as food, is cultivated in the tropical regions at altitudes of less than 1800 meters. Many varieties and forms not yet studied are known in Peru. In the xerophytic and sub- xerophytic valleys, wild relatives of the yuca grow. APrIcHu (in Quechua), BATATAS, CAMOTE, AJES-Ipomoea Batatas Lam. (Convolvu- laceae). This plant is found represented on vessels of Mochica origin in two colors, red and yellow. The plant is twining, and its tuberous roots are rich in starch and used as food. Many forms and varieties exist, differ- ing in the form and color of the tubers. Among the vegetable products of the New World, the first and most widely accepted in the Old World was this plant, as it was quickly propagated under cultivation (Fig. 8). PALLAR-Phaseolus lunatus L. and FRIJOL -Phaseolus vulgaris L. (Leguminosae). The first named plant bears large white seeds ap- proximately 35 mm. in length and 20 mm. in width; the second has smaller seeds of different shapes and colors. The former is cultivated chiefly in the coastal valleys; the latter in the mesothermic inter-Andean val- leys. Both are edible. The Moehica potters painted the seeds on large clay bowls. The Nasea artisans also pictured the seed (some- times in the process of germinating) as an ornamental motif on clay bowls. In Queehua, the "frijol" (bean) is called "purutu." See Fig. 9, of Mochica origin. INCHIS, MANI-Arachis hypogaea L. (Leguminosae). This plant is seen in relief in Fig. 10 on a vessel from Paracas (also from Chillon), an exact representation of the legume of the peanut. It is cultivated for its seeds, rich in oleaginous substances and</page><page sequence="5">110 ECONOMIC BOTANY Fig. 10. carbohydrates, in tropical valleys of the coastal region, chiefly in the eastern part, below 1600 meters. ZAPALLO-Cucurbita moschata Jacq. (Cu- curbitaceae). In Paracas, representations of this creeping plant are found in the typical red and white ware; and in Chimfi pottery, in black (Fig. 11 and 12, respectively). The "zapallo," in its varied forms, is cultivated for its edible fruits in the coastal valleys and in the interior regions of the Andes. Pottery motifs show the gourd-like fruit. UCHU, AJI-Capsicum sp. (Solanaceae). The artisans of Nasca and Chimu' utilized the fruits of the different species of this genus as a decorative motif, chiefly in paintings. Occasionally, it is found in high relief. The plant is cultivated in tropical valleys for its fruit which is employed as a condiment (Fig. 13). ACHUPALLA, ANANA-Ananas comosus (L.) Merrill (Bromeliaceae). I have seen a painting of this plant on a wooden pot in the Museo Arqueologico of the Universidad Nacional de Cuzco; a part of it is shown in Fig. 14. The writer cited this plant-motif for the first time in the Bol. Soc. Arg. Bot., loc. cit. At this writing, I do not know of another such motif. PACAE-Inga Feuillei DC. (Leguminosae). Representations of this fruit are common in Chimui pottery (Fig. 15). The plant grows wild or cultivated in tropical coastal or inter- Andean valleys. It is grown generally for its edible seeds, white, fleshy, sweet, and covered by a white, arillate membrane. Many shrub- by or arboreal species are known, a number of which have edible seeds. Therefore, Inga Feuillei is a relative determination, not exact, although on the coast it appears to corre- spond with the "pacae," common in that species. LUCMA, LUCUMA-Lucuma bifera Mol. (Sapotaceae). This is one of the most com- il 12 13 Fig. 11-13</page><page sequence="6">PHYTOMORPHIC REPRESENTATIONS OF THE ANCIENT PERUVIANS Ill nionly employed motifs in the coastal cul- ture, as in the bi-color Nasca pottery and the black ware of Chimui. It is also found frequently in Chimbote in northern Peru. The motif shown is the rounded, green, berry-shaped fruit with a yellow and sweet mesocarp. The tree is often 12 meters in height and very leafy. It is found in the coastal and temperate inter-Andean valleys (Fig. 16). CACHuM-(Queehua), CACHUMA (Aymara) according to Cobo; "pepino" in Spanish- Solanum muricatum Ait. (Solanaceae). Orna- mental representations often include the fruit, frequently used in ceremonies of Par- acas origin. This plant is still cultivated in the valleys of the coastal regions, the edible fruit being succulent. Its colors are most often yellow and purplish, and the juicy mesocarp is popular as a refreshment. On the stone "conopas" of Quillabamba (Convenci6n, Cuzco), I have been able to identify this fruit. Figure 17 depicts a Paracas clay object. PAPAYA-Carica candicans Gray and C. Papaya L. (Caricaceae). The potters of Nasca used this motif in bi-colored vessels, at times combining it with animal-motifs (Fig. 18). This is a small tree, approxi- mating 3 meters in height, growing in the mesothermic valleys and bearing fruit about 14 cm. in length. ANONAS, MASA SAMBA-Anona muricata L. (Anonaceae). Artifacts representing, with great exactitude, the fruit of this plant are frequently discovered on Chimui pottery (Fig. 19). The tree, about 8-10 meters in U41 Fig. 14. height, bears an edible fruit inferior m quality and taste to the fruit of Anona Cherimolia Miller, the "chirimoyo."1 Both are tropical trees. AcHIRA-Canna edulis Ker. (Cannaceae). The clay potters of the coastal culture repre- sented the rhizomes of this plant in the form of vessels belonging to the Nasca c-ulture but present also in Chim4 ware (Fig. 20). This plant is still cultivated not only as an 16 17 Fig. 15-17.</page><page sequence="7">112 ECONOMIC BOTANY ornamental but also in some inter-Andean valleys, and on the narrow shores of the Apurimae River, Province of Paruro, for its starchy, edible rhizomes. JIQUIMA, AJIPA-Pachyrrhizus tuberosus Speng. (Leguminosae). In the Nasea painted pottery are found both the entire plant and the rhizomes alone which are turnip-shaped, robust, edible, fleshy and rich in water and carbohydrates. The stalks are twining and branching. According to Cobo, "asipa" in Que'chua and "villu" in Aymara is an en- demic of Central America, whence it was probably introduced into Peru at some re- mote time. It is no longer found on the coast. The writer has encountered the plant cultivated in the tropical valleys of Huain- uco; apparently it is not used as a food, but the seed is pulverized and used as an insecticide (Fig. 21). PALTA-Persea americana Mill. (Lau- raceae). It would seem that no clay repre- sentations of this plant exist. I recently had the good fortune to examine a fairly well imitated stone representation ("conopa") of the fruit from the Rosell collection. It was found in a narrow neck of the Apurimac River, at Kairancka on the left bank of the river. To judge by certain documents in the possession of Dr. Rosell, the plant has been cultivated there from time immemorial. The chroniclers frequently compare the fruit to the pear beeause of its similiarity in shape to that fruit; in Colombia and Ecuador it is called "aguacate." Garcilaso believes that it was introduced from the Province of Paltas in Ecuador. In Peru the name cur- rently used is "palta." TOMATE-Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., L. peruvianum Dun. (Solanaceae). Phyto- morphie representations are quite scarce; neither the writer nor Dr. F. L. Herrera has been able to discover convincing motifs of the "tomate" depicted by the pre-Columbian Peruvian artists. Nevertheless, Dr. Herrera states: "Perhaps this fruit is to be found reproduced, together with those of the "aji" and various suches (fishes), in an Inca plate cited by Doering in his work 'Altperuanische Gefaessnalereen,' t. 1, pl. XXIV," (page 56, Rev. Mus. Nac. Lima t. IV, N. 1). In this same work, on page 55, the author states: "the name 'tomate' seems to have originated in Mexico; the name by which it was called in the aboriginal language has been lost, as have those of many other species now known solely by their Spanish names." But the present writer has found an interesting reference, which, however, requires newer and more detailed investigation. In "El primer nuevo cronica y buen gobierno" by Phelipe Guaman Poma de Ayala' is the state- ment (p. 171): "Also the queen Capac Pomagvallea bears the 'Cieela YuYu."' Ac- cording to Posnanski, "Ciecla YuYu" is an allusion to the tomato. The phrase should be translated "edible herb." This is prob- ably, then, one of the rare, perhaps the sole, reference to the tomato as a native Quechua plant. B. Ornamental plants. The rich and vaiied Peruvian flora, particularly that of the Andes, so impressed the ancient peoples that they were inspired to use many plants as art-motifs. The natives then, as now, were accustomed to adorn themselves with flowers of the most brilliant colors, many of which were considered sacred and were grown near their habitations. Inca artists made more frequent use of plants custom- arily used for adornment than did the coastal potters and artisans. The following plants are frequently represented: KANTU, KANTUTA-Cantua buxifolia Lam. (Polemoniaceae). Together with "niucchu," this plant constitutes one of the most com- mon elements of ornamentation employed by the Incas in artifacts of clay and in the wooden keros (pots). Considered a sacred symbol by royalty, this flower is often men- tioned by the chroniclers. The illustration on page 120 of the book of Guaman Poma de Ayala is considered most significant. It de- picts "the second coia, Chimbo Ucma [who] ruled in Cuzco until the time of Hatun Colla" bearing flowers of this species. Now cultivated, this shrub is about 2 meters high, with a slender, branched stalk, the flowers corymbose with deep scarlet cor- olla, although some, possibly hybrids, are known to have yellow and even mixed colors -yellow, rose, etc. NuccHu-Salvia oppositiflora R. et P. (Labiatae). "Nucchu" is depicted on cer- amics, wooden cups and textiles. It is a plant common on Andean ridges, suffrutes- cent, bearing beautiful flowers which are usually red.</page><page sequence="8">PHYTOMORPHIC REPRESENTATIONS OF THE ANCIENT PERUVIANS 11.3 18 190 ..... ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ .. . . ..... 2f 22 23 Fig. 18-23. CHIMPU-CHIMPU-Fuschsia sp. (Onagra- ceae). On some wooden cups and vessels of the Inca culture are frequently found flowers of Fuchsia species, among these pos- sibly Fuchsia boliviana Corr., which bears flowers about 6 cm. in length. This shrub is cultivated in temperate valleys, near habita- tions. Fuchsia sanctaerosae Kuntze, with smaller flowers, is also common on the "brow of the mountain" ("ceja de la montafia"). CHINCHIRCUMA-Mutisia viciaefolia Can. (Compositae). In the upper part of the wooden pot shown in Figure 22, flowers of this species, also a favorite of the Inca, may be observed. This is a shrub common in the temperate regions, at altitudes of between 2860 and 3550 meters. Finally, on wooden objects, certain other plants are to be found; these belong to the Amaryllidaceae and represent the following species: ATTOC-CHUPAN, CHIHUANHAUI-Crocopsis fulgens Pax. (Amaryllidaceae). In the lower part of Fig. 22, may be seen a long, tubular flower with an inferior ovary and linear leaves, somewhat stylized. The flowers are reddish, beautiful and showy, growing at ground level, generally on rocks; the leaves appear after anthesis. SULLU-SULLu-Bomarea sanguinea Kranzl., B. dulcis (Hook.) Beauv. (Amaryllidaceae). Representations of this plant (probably the first of the two species) also adorn "keros" (Fig. 23). A well defined border of Bom- area dulcis decorates the upper edge of a "kero" in the Rosell collection. Other spe- cies of amaryllidaceous genera are less fre- quently seen, such as Urceolina peruviana (Presl) Macbr., which is common in the mountain regions, and species of the genus Hippeastrum. C. Miscellaneous motifs. Less frequent, but no less interesting than those described above, are the following plant-motifs: CHOCHOYUYU (Quechua) - Macrocystis Hurmboldtii Ag. (Laminariaceae). This alga, seen in a picture pointed out by Professor Herrera in his article cited above, appears on ceramics of Nasea origin.</page><page sequence="9">114 ECONOMIC BOTANY Fig. 24. RAQUI-RAQUI-Dennstaedtia Lamb ertiana Christ. (Polypodiaeeae). This fern, frequent in inter-Andean ravines, growing on the banks of ditches, is probably the subject of the ornamental designs found on vessels of varying size of Inca culture. The fronds, showing sori, are stylized. These decorations are not found on coastal artifacts, or, if they exist, are very rare (Fig. 24.) There is some question as to the identification of this fern. PALMITo-REuterpe edulis Mart (Palma- ceae). This and other palms are common in the eastern tropical valleys. The apical scape is used as food. The palm is found on some keros, often combined with animal-motifs (Fig. 25). Drawings of this tree are found in the book of Guaman Poma de Ayala. PINTOCC, PINTUK-Gynerium, sagittatum Beauv. (Gramineae). In some Nasea paint- ings, warriors are seen carrying spears made of the stalks of this riparious plant, frequent in the eastern and coastal valleys. The names given are those used by Cobo and Holguin, respectively. Inhabitants of the Amazonian forests use the cane for the same purpose today. The name "pintoec" is still in use, but the Spanish name is "eafna brava." QUENAS -- Art hrostylidium harmonicum Parodi (Gramineae). In Guaman Poma de Ayala's writing, there is an interesting and curious drawing of persons carrying "quen- as," musical instruments made from the stems of this plant. It is a native of the "ceja de la montafia," growing in high and humid places, in siaall populations; few plants grow to a height of more than 20 meters. The plant, collected by the author, has recently been described as a species new to science. TOTORA-Scirpus Tatora Kunth. (Cypera- ceae). Stylized paintings of this plant are found on Nasca pottery in the Museo Na- cional in Lima. Probably the plant shown is one of those commonly found on the shores of lakes and lagoons. Also, page 310 of the work of Guaman Poma de Ayala shows two natives carrying stems of "totora." Figure 26 is a photograph of a Nasea artifact. THACCO (Quechua), ALGARRon0-Prosopis limensis Benth. (Leguminosae). In the painted ceramics of Moche we see this ar- boreal species which is common in coastal valleys (Fig. 27). HAHUACCOLLAI, TUNAS and others (Caeta- ceae). Various species of cacti are depicted on vessels of Nasca and Chimfu origin. These belong apparently to the following genera: Opuntia sp. (more than one species) ; Tricho- cereus, Lobivia and Epiphyllum. On a frag- ment of clay from Tiahuanaeo, the author found a drawing, probably Trichocereus cuz- coensis Brit. et Rose, which apparently is the Fig. 25.</page><page sequence="10">PHYTOMORPHIC REPRESENTATIONS OP THE ANCIENT PERUVIANS 115 2 - ......... . .... ... . . . . . . : . . .. . . . 26 2:7 Fig. 26-27. columnar "hahuaccollai," common on the ridges of southern Peru. TANCAR, uPA TANCAR-Solanum pseudo- lycioides Rusby (Solanaceae). I have found the fruits of this plant painted upon an Inca plate in the Museo Arqueologico of the Universidad de Cuzco. This shrub is frequent at altitudes between 3200-3600 meters, form- ing living fences. The flowers are white to lavender; the fruits small, spherical, reddish yellow when ripe. MAICHIi-Thevetia neriifolia Juss. (fide Herrera). (Apocynaceae). On artifacts of the Mochica culture, the seeds of this plant are found in relief in an almost angular form. This is a small shrub, with large yellow flowers, growing in the coastal valleys. According to Herrera, the fruit is still used in the northern part of Peru for the manu- facture of toys and necklaces. In southern Peru, I have found T. peruviana (Pers.) Merrill frequent in the xerophytic inter- Andean valleys (Apurimae) and in those of the eastern section (Convencion), where the forest folk use the fruit also to make ornaments. PIcHuRIN-Nectandra Pichurim (Willd.) Mez. (Lauraceae). Also found on objects of clay of Mochica origin, in high relief, the seeds of this arboreal of tropical Peru are easily recognizable. Conclusion In conclusion, I must again affirm the fact that future investigations and future discov- eries will undoubtedly increase appreciably the list of plant-motifs which were employed by the ancient Peruvians. The list which I have tried to identify and describe in the present article is limited, but it may present some information of interest to specialists in botany, ethnology and archaeology.</page></plain_text>
