<plain_text><page sequence="1">philosophE of Science VOL. 4 April, 1 937 NO. The Meaning of Simplicity in Physics BY R. B. LINDSAY f K'sN THE fourteenth century William of Occam in the course of his attack on the medieval scho- lastic philosophy enunciated his famous "razor": Entia non sun t multiplicanda praeter necessitatem (hypotheses should not be multiplied unneces- sarily). This is the classic claim for the descrip- tion of nature in terms of the minimum possible number of funda- mental concepts. It was presumably so recognized by Newton in the third book of his "Principia" in 1687 when he wrote: "We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances. To this purpose the philosophers say that Nature does nothing in vain, and more is in vain when less will serve; for Nature is pleased with simplicity' and affects not the pomp of superfluous causes." There is little doubt that the progress of science during the i8th century was colored by the feeling that nature is simple. Perhaps our forerunners of the last century were not so sure. How do we feel about this matter today ? Is nature really simple? What does this phrase mean to the modern physicist? The present article is concerned with these and related questions. ! Newton's Latin reads "Enim Natura simplex est." 151</page><page sequence="2">152 Simplicity in Physics A study of the history of physics clearly indicates that the first impression of any natural phenomenon is almost always one of disorder and confusion. Only gradually do the careful and thoughtful investigators transform chaos into order. Certain aspects ultimately emerge as being of particular significance and are seized upon to the exclusion of others which are felt to be irrelevant. The Greeks must have contemplated the behavior of immersed bodies for ages before Archimedes hit upon the really pertinent facts and announced the laws of hydrostatics. A simi- lar situation is seen in the discovery of the principles of motion by Galileo. Now the ability to describe large sequences of phe- nomena in terms of a single principle makes a great impression on the human mind and it is very difficult to resist the feeling that there is a reason for this success: namely that nature is essentially simple. So there grows the conviction that the true laws are simple laws in the sense that they are expressible in terms of a few symbolic concepts and a few elementary mathematical operations. From this point of view the truth of laws like those of Boyle and Hooke is seen to be guaranteed by their particularly simple functional form; this actually was a common argument during the early nineteenth century. It does not strike us so convincingly today, for we recall that whenever we probe more deeply into the phenomenon described by the "simple" law the elementary formula no longer describes adequately the new details and must be replaced by something more elaborate unless the entire fundamental viewpoint is changed. For example, the familiar falling body formula s = 2 gt2 may appear at first sight to insure the essential simplicity of motion near the surface of the earth. More careful investigation, how- ever, shows that the formula is not strictly true, for it does not account for the observed small eastward deflection and other peculiarities of the fall. To describe the latter, more complicated equations are necessary. This does not dim the ardor for sim- plicity, however, for ultimately some clever person observes that the difficulty is due to our use of a system of reference which, being fixed in the earth, is rotating. The "simple" formula holds in a non-rotating frame, which to be sure is rather unnatural for</page><page sequence="3">R. B. Lindsay '53 us on the earth to employ. We exchange the simplicity of a for- mula for the simplicity of a more fundamental concept: it is im- possible for us to have our cake and eat it too. There are many illustrations of the situation where a so-called "simple" formula acts as a cloak for a description of nature which many physicists consider to be actually very complex. This, for example, is the case with the celebrated quantum theory relation Ex - E2 = hv. No one doubts the huge success of this analyti- cally very simple formula. There are still many, however, who feel that it conceals a mystery which will eventually be clarified and explained in "simple" terms, e.g. by an appropriate modifica- tion in the basic point of view. The major difficulty encountered in discussing all these things lies, it is clear, in the lack of precision in the meaning of the concept of simplicity in physics. We wish therefore to examine various possible definitions, their advantages and shortcomings. One trivial way to end the discussion at the start would be to agree to see in simplicity nothing but the basic assumption of the uniformity of nature on which the possibility of all science rests. Then all physics is per se simple. It is difficult to be contented with this disposition of the problem. Let us try something less tautological. In 1874 Kirchhoff, in the introduction to his lectures on mathe- matical physics, defined mechanics as the subject whose task it is to describe completely and in the most simple manner the motions occurring in nature. The fundamental emphasis on the idea of simplicity in this definition is suggestive. The implication is strong that the success, nay even the truth of mechanics, depends largely on its simplicity. This comes very close to associating simplicity with truth: if we only knew what is true, we should automatically know what is simple and vice versa. But how are we to know what is true? It is more than probable that Kirch- hoff took for granted that every physicist knows what simplicity is; unfortunately this is just the problem we are investigating. Other writers on the foundations of physics, e.g., Mach and Poincare, seem equally to take the general understanding of the meaning of simplicity in physics for granted.</page><page sequence="4">i54 Simplicity in Physics Recently indeed, Reichenbach2 has criticized Kirchhoff's ap- parent tendency to emphasize the close connection between simplicity and truth by introducing two separate notions to which the name simplicity may be attached. The first, descriptive sim- plicity, is illustrated by imagining the existence of a number of equivalent theories which may be used indifferently in the descrip- tion of a given set of phenomena. There is no meaning to the question: which theory is true? For certain purposes, one may be more convenient than another. Thus for most practical optical calculations the ray theory of light is more convenient than the wave theory, although all the facts can be adequately described by either theory. As far as these phenomena are con- cerned geometrical optics may be preferred because of its sim- plicity, which here is presumably to be interpreted as convenience. Before criticizing this notion let us pass on to Reichenbach's second kind of simplicity to which he ascribes the name inductive. This is exemplified by the ordinary practice of the physicist of drawing a smooth curve through the discrete set of points used for the graphical representation of experimental observations. Reichenbach considers the feeling for simplicity inherent in this tendency as more fundamental than the descriptive one. It is hardly misinterpreting him to suspect that he considers inductive simplicity as closely associated with truth value. The continuous curve is assigned a greater truth value because of its greater prob- ability, which is thus used as a criterion for truth and at the same time for simplicity. When we probe a little below the surface it is difficult to see any fundamental difference between the two definitions. Cer- tainly there is no definite assurance that the continuous curve we draw through the discrete points describes the observed phe- nomena more truthfully than do the points themselves. It is granted that the mathematical technique involved in working with the continuous curve is more familiar to most than that involved in working with the discrete points. But this does not make the curve more probable or more truthful unless we are willing to base probability and truthfulness on convenience. This 2 Handbuch der Physik, Vol. IV (Berlin, Springer, 1929) p. 34.</page><page sequence="5">R. B. Lindsay 55 course, however, would reduce "inductive" simplicity to the same level as "descriptive" simplicity. Indeed it is possible to argue that the drawing of the smooth curve is a priori an unwarranted extrapolation. We do it simply because it works, i.e., the result- ing description agrees often enough with experience to satisfy us. What do we mean by saying that one procedure or one theory is more convenient than another? Perhaps it is an instinctive and not analysable concept. Curiously enough what seems con- venient to scientists of one age appears the reverse to those of another: to treat light as a wave phenomenon in an elastic solid appeared convenient to the physicists of the nineteenth century; it has long since ceased to appeal to our contemporary age. In so far as simplicity is measured by convenience it alters with time. The idea of convenience is without doubt closely associated with Mach's "economy of thought" concept, though this idea itself demands more study than has been given to it. The foregoing brief critique indicates the desirability of explor- ing further the possible meanings that may be attributed to sim- plicity in physics. Physics is a description of a portion of human experience. The simplicity of physics is thus essentially simplicity of description. What do we mean by a simple description? Certainly this ques- tion would be answered differently by a naturalist and a physicist. The naturalist depicts the structure, behavior and relations of animals by means of a system of classification into types; this is of such a nature that a careful examination of any particular animal enables him to fit it into its proper place in the system. The method of description employs a specially invented technical vocabulary, but aside from this the language used is that of every- day speech. Presumably the naturalist considers his description simple if it replaces the complexity of animal life apparent to the untutored observer by a classification embodying the smallest possible number of essentially different types. And his search for simplicity presumably becomes the search for the method of classification which meets this requirement. Now physics is not a classificatory science and in its ultimate form, namely theoretical physics, uses largely the symbolic lan-</page><page sequence="6">156 Simplicity in Physics guage of mathematics in place of the language of common speech. A symbol is assigned to represent each physical concept, and the laws of physics are the relations among these symbols which are verifiable by experience. Physics is deemed to have solved its task satisfactorily if it is possible by the introduction of suitable postulates (the principles of physical theories) to deduce purely mathematically the laws which experience confirms. But here is the nub of the matter: when shall we say that this process is simple? It is presumably sensible to examine each element of the process from the standpoint of simplicity. These elements are: (I) the fundamental concepts, (2) the postulates, (3) the mathematical methods for deducing laws from the postulates. Of all physical concepts, what are the simplest ? The physicists of the nineteenth century would have betrayed no hesitation in answering: those most closely associated with primitive sense per- ceptions, viz., space, time and number with the attendant proper- ties of the three dimensionality of space, its Euclidean geometry, etc. Not all our predecessors of the past century would have insisted that these concepts are intuitive and a priori, but most of them held that they flow naturally from the primitive sense data. It was therefore natural for them to believe that a physical theory constructed solely from such concepts is simple. Of all physical theories, classical mechanics most closely fulfills the assumed criterion, since it operates with concepts most immedi- ately connected with ordinary experience. The conclusion to be drawn seemingly is that in order for physics to be simple it should rest on a mechanical basis. Hence the high favor bestowed on mechanical theories during the eighteenth and most of the nine- teenth centuries. Even today there are not lacking voices that lament the "complexity and abstractness" of quantum theory and plaintively long for the fundamental "simplicity" of the mechanics of Galileo, Huyghens and Newton. After all, classical mechanics is "understandable!" Unfortunately the story of the failure of classical mechanics in the description of atomic phenomena is but too familiar. If only the atom had not pushed its way into the fore front of physi-</page><page sequence="7">R. B. Lindsay I57 cal speculation all would have been well. But this is only another way of saying: if only physicists were to confine their investiga- tions to the macroscopic and stop short of the microscopic domain, the classical theories would still satisfy! There is indeed small reason to doubt the possibility of a purely mechanical description of all physical phenomena, but the price of this seems almost prohibitive. At any rate the attempts so far made in the atomic domain have led to what most physicists agree is unnecessary and undesirable complexity. It is therefore evident that there exists no reason for maintaining the view that simplicity resides essentially in mechanical concepts. Perhaps it would be fairer to say that while such concepts may appear most simple in the sense of being closer to direct experience, the whole process of physical reasoning using them becomes too complicated as soon as the macroscopic domain is transcended. To clarify the discussion of this point it will help to examine a particular concept which is of importance in all physical theories, viz., the "state" of a physical system, and contrast its meaning in classical mechanics to that in quantum mechanics. Classically, in the case of a system of particles the state is said to be specified by the coordinates and momenta of the particles in some reference system. Usage here is not entirely standardized, for a knowledge of the coordinates alone is often said to fix the configuration of the system while knowledge of both coordinates and momenta specifies the phase. The important thing to note is that the phase or state, classically conceived, is essentially a set of numbers attached to symbols representing directly mechanical concepts which flow more or less immediately from primitive space and time sense data. These numbers and the state they specify may alter with the time. Even in the case where the dynamical method is applied to problems in which motion is not directly observed, e.g., the dynamical theory of electric currents, the state of the system, i.e., the circuit under consideration, is given by a set of directly measurable quantities viz., the charges and currents. The classical concept of state is therefore very closely related to crude experience. Much more abstract is the meaning of state in quantum me-</page><page sequence="8">158 Simplicity in Physics chanics. Here the state is specified by a mathematical function of certain variables, viz., space and time coordinates or transforms of these. The function itself is not a mechanical quantity, at least in the familiar sense. Rather it is a kind of "source" func- tion from which mechanical quantities can be calculated by means of a fundamental formula of quantum mechanics. We do not need to present a detailed analysis. We shall only emphasize that the two concepts of state are on different levels of abstraction. Who is to say, however, which is the more simple ? On the ground of familiarity alone many physicists would naturally prefer the classical concept. Since, however, anyone who wishes to take the trouble can understand the quantum mechanical concept sufficiently to use it with success, any preference here based on an assumed a priori simplicity of classical mechanics appears de- cidedly illusory. The tentative conclusion reached at this point is thus that it is impossible to find a criterion for simplicity in the fundamental concepts of physical theories. But it may be objected that we have not exhausted the possibilities here. Every physical theory rests on a plurality of concepts. Can we not say that the sim- plicity of a theory is measured inversely by the number of inde- pendent concepts necessary for its establishment? A striking illustration of the plausibility of this judgment would appear to be provided by the theory of light in a comparison of the corpuscular theory of Newton with the wave theory of Huy- ghens, Fresnel and Maxwell. The former operates with cor- puscles or small particles emitted in every direction from luminous bodies. These corpuscles move through an ethereal medium per- vading the universe, including also all matter. When corpuscles impinge on the surface of a body the difference in the ethereal medium inside and outside is invoked to account for the deflection of the light ray, which takes place toward the normal if the ve- locity of light is greater inside than outside. At the same time the incidence of the corpuscles excites vibrations in the ether and this provides a mechanism for the absorption of light by the body in question. Toward the end of his life Newton inclined more and more to discard the ether and get along with the particles</page><page sequence="9">R. B. Lindsay I59 alone. Now the light corpuscle is undoubtedly suggested by the concept of the material particle of classical mechanics and it would have been very satisfactory if the phenomena of optics could be described merely by endowing the corpuscle with extra- polations of the ordinary properties of such a particle, viz., vanishingly small size and inertia, very large velocity and the power of attracting or being attracted by material particles. Unfortunately Newton found it necessary to attribute to the corpuscle additional properties apparently very different from those of observed material particles. For example, he had to suppose that the corpuscles when incident from a vacuum on the surface of a body are attracted by a force which acts only along the normal to the surface. Moreover, in order to account for the color phenomena associated with the incidence of white light on thin plates he had to assume the possibility of the corpuscle get- ting into a kind of transient state disposing it to be easily trans- mitted or reflected, (recall the so-called "fits of easy transmission and reflection"). Finally in order to account for polarization he was forced to postulate that "every ray of light has two opposite sides," etc. All these assumptions involve the introduction of what can only be considered independent concepts foreign to the nature of the material particle of classical mechanics. The situation appears to be much improved in the wave theory of light. The ordinary wave concept of the classical mechanics of media suffices, without the addition of gratuitous postulates, to describe not only reflection and refraction but also the diffrac- tion, interference and polarization of light. To be sure difficulties arise when the properties of the medium are investigated closely: the elastic solid constituting the luminiferous medium has to be more elastic than steel and yet so tenuous as to oppose no observable resistance to the motion of the planets. It might seem that this theory like the corpuscular theory sins by the invocation of extra concepts not contemplated in the classical theory of media. However, this particular trouble was obviated by the reminder of Stokes that even certain ordinary substances, e.g. pitch, are comparatively rigid to sufficiently rapid deformations, but oppose little resistance to slow deformation. The concept</page><page sequence="10">i6o Simplicity in Physics of the elastic solid light-bearing medium would thus appear to be a reasonable extrapolation of the elastic solid of ordinary experience. A more serious problem is provided by the necessity of getting rid of the longitudinal wave which exists in disturbed elastic solids but which is not observed in optical phenomena. This is not the place to enter into the long history of the attempts to circumvent this embarrassment. It is sufficient to remark that the problem was finally solved only at the cost of considerable elaboration which most physicists would today regard as the sacri- fice of simplicity. As a matter of fact by the time the problem was solved the elastic solid theory of light had been shelved and its place taken by the electromagnetic theory. This brought to the fore a quite different, independent concept, the electromag- netic field. As applied to light the fundamental idea of both theories is that of wave propagation, and judged by the criterion of simplicity mentioned above it is hardly to be doubted that they must both be regarded as simpler than the Newtonian corpuscular theory. If the questions raised by the medium (either elastic or electromagnetic) are brought forward to dispute the credibility of this statement the reply may be made that in the way in which the wave theory of light is actually used in the discussion of the elementary phenomena of reflection, refraction, diffraction, interference and polarization (dispersion and absorption are here expressly omitted) the properties of the medium as such do not enter in any vital way, the behavior of waves in general being sufficient for the description. In other words one does not have to postulate for light waves special properties in addition to and foreign to those of waves in material media. The purpose of this somewhat lengthy summary of the theories of light has been to emphasize what may be called for short the "minimal-concept" or numerical criterion of physical simplicity. Another illustration has been mentioned and commented on by H. Margenau.3 This is derived from a comparison of the i8th century caloric theory of heat with the more recent mechanical theory. It is at once observed that the caloric theory sins against the above mentioned criterion by being forced to ascribe to the 3H. Margenau, Phil. Sci., 2, 48, 1935.</page><page sequence="11">R. B. Lindsay 161 heat substance, caloric, the property of creatability, not con- templated in the ordinary physical properties of matter. This is an additional independent concept. It is rendered superfluous by the assumption that heat is a form of energy to which the conservation law applies. Other illustrations of the "minimal-concept" criterion can doubtless be produced. However, in the examination of them a certain fundamental question arises. Just what meaning is to be attributed to the term "independent concept?" In the above example from the theory of light there seems to be no doubt that the average physicist will be satisfied to consider the possibility that a light corpuscle shall get into a "transient state," a concept foreign to those which classical mechanics utilizes. To this extent it is fair to treat it as an "independent" and unrelated concept. The same can be said of the hypothesis of the creata- bility of caloric. Let us, however, look at the matter more closely. For the sake of explicitness we confine our attention to mechanics. Now material particle, displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, mass and energy are mechanical concepts.4 Are all these independent? Let us examine this question by reviewing the meaning assigned to these various concepts. In mechanics the material particle is a concept defined in terms of certain properties. Thus effectively a material particle has all the properties of a geometrical point in Euclidean 3-dimen- sional space in addition to two others of a non-geometrical nature, viz., (I) that of having certain relations to other particles, so that its motion is in general dependent on its position relative to other particles, and (2) that of inertia, the measure of which is its mass. These concepts become precise only when described in terms of the kinematical concepts of displacement, velocity and accel- eration.5 4 In the interesting paper of Margenau, above cited, on the Methodology of Physics, the term "construct" is introduced in place of "concept," presumably to emphasize the active constructive role of the mind in building physical theories. This is a worthwhile procedure. However, the present paper will continue to use the more familiar term with the feeling that no essential ambiguity will result. 5 See Lindsay and Margenau, "Foundations of Physics," (New York, I936) p. 79 if.</page><page sequence="12">162 Simplicity in Physics The question now arises as to the mutual relation of displace- ment and velocity. If we consider that time and space are both necessary fundamental elements in which mechanical description is to be carried out, then all displacement must take place in time and the concept of velocity is not independent of or unrelated to that of displacement. It is idle to argue that the precise sym- bolic form in which velocity is expressed (i.e., whether distance divided by time or time divided by distance) represents a choice not dependent on the concept of displacement. The fact remains that once motion is admitted to be something which takes place in both space and time the concept of displacement is logically unthinkable without a corresponding concept relating displace- ment with time and the precise manner of defining this latter concept is a matter of indifference. It seems that the same argument must hold for acceleration and indeed for all higher time derivatives of displacement which might be introduced into mechanics. Whether time and space are themselves unrelated concepts is a philosophical question into which we do not intend to go. When we come to the assumed non-geometrical properties of the material particle, it is seen that the assumption that the particle has certain relations to other particles is an essentially new property from those of position and change of position alone. Mechanics conceivably might operate with swarms of particles having no relation to each other (where, for example, only the number per unit volume might be of significance). Actually it does not do this. Moreover the precise assumptions underlying the definition of mass are also independent of the purely kinematic concepts.6 On the other hand on the basis of the foundations of classical mechanics as discussed in the book just mentioned the concept of force cannot be considered as independent of those of kinematics, the assumed interrelations of particles and mass. It is perfectly conceivable to develop the whole of mechanics without explicit reference to force (cf. Gauss' principle of least constraint and Hertz's development of the theory of mechanics). The same situation is met with in the concept of energy. When 8 Cf. "Foundations of Physics," p. 9I.</page><page sequence="13">R. B. Lindsay I63 we introduce these concepts it is not so much via new assump- tions as merely baptizing certain combinations of symbols which occur frequently and therefore seem to merit special attention and use. This is quite a different thing from independence in the usual sense. Naturally the viewpoint taken here excludes the introduction of force and energy as anthropomorphic concepts wholly outside the purely logical development of mechanics. It seems clear then that in any classical mechanical theory of a realm of physical phenomena there is a definite number of independent concepts. Any additional assumptions about mate- rial particles transcending the fundamental principles of me- chanics, such as, for example, the assumption of the creatability of particles out of nothing or the destruction of particles, are then genuinely foreign, independent and unrelated concepts. As an- other illustration consider the quantum conditions of Bohr's atomic theory. These introduce into mechanics the concept of the quantum of action which is not at all contemplated in the fundamental classical principles. On the other hand how stands it with the usual initial and boundary conditions of mechanical problems? These appear merely as specifications appropriate to render definite the solution of the equations of motion for a par- ticular problem. They cannot be considered as entailing any- thing independent of the fundamental concepts. The same may be said about the choice of the Hamiltonian function for a dy- namical system. The principles of mechanics lay down no rules for the choice of such functions beyond the usual purely analytical requirements of differentiability, etc. The choice of a particular Hamiltonian can therefore not be considered an unrelated as- sumption grafted on to the fundamentals. Now it is usually stated that all physical phenomena can ultimately be reduced to a description in terms of classical me- chanics. If this is really the case the number of fundamentally independent, unrelated concepts will be the same for all such theories and on the numerical criterion of simplicity they are thus all equally simple! It is very doubtful that many physicists would be willing to accept this as a sensible conclusion. Hence what we have called the minimal-concept criterion of simplicity</page><page sequence="14">164 Simplicity in Physics becomes illusory unless one wishes to deny the validity of the statement made at the beginning of the paragraph. Thus, for example, one may actually take the attitude that it is really im- possible to provide a genuine classical mechanical description of atomic phenomena. One then looks for a completely different construction and finds it, let us say, in quantum mechanics. This is of course a very proper procedure but very question-begging so far as a decision on the numerical criterion of simplicity is concerned. If we still believe in the criterion, we are faced with the fact that quantum mechanics operates with the concepts of classical mechanics but adds to them the wholly foreign concept of the t function and the reinterpretation of the concept of "state" as we have already previously observed. On this basis one is forced to confess that it is necessary to forego the simplicity of classical mechanics for the sake of describing new and more complicated phenomena. This will probably not impress an enthusiastic quantum physicist. He would probably prefer to conclude that the numerical criterion of simplicity is meaningless and that simplicity is something which can not be measured but which must be felt intuitionally-in one's bones, as it were. As we think further about the matter we are compelled to be- lieve that the numerical criterion of simplicity encounters still another difficulty. It is this: This criterion takes no account of the relatively great difference in nature of different concepts. It is perfectly conceivable that two theories may operate with precisely the same number of concepts, yet those of the one may be relatively much more abstract than those of the other. For example, the quantum mechanical concept of state is more ab- stract than that of classical mechanics, in the sense that the former has less relation to actual human experience in the large. How really can we compare from the standpoint of simplicity such radically different ideas? It seems futile to endeavor to do so. We therefore reach the conclusion that there is little or no satis- faction to be obtained in attempting to use the numerical sim- plicity criterion in the concepts of physics. We have already mentioned that the process of physical reasoning includes not only the concepts but also the postulates which relate the con-</page><page sequence="15">R. B. Lindsay I65 cepts and the mathematical methods of manipulating the postu- lates in the deduction of physical laws. Now the postulates in a very real sense serve to define the meaning of the concepts and consequently most that has already been said about simplicity in connection with concepts applies equally well to simplicity in connection with the postulates. How, for example, is one to compare decisively the assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases with the principles of thermodynamics? The former are so spe- cific and the latter are so general that they appear of an entirely different character altogether. Any merely numerical compari- son appears to be utterly out of the question. The same inference appears to be even more plainly indicated in an examination of the mathematical analysis used in expressing physical theories. To be sure, it might be considered more properly in the province of the mathematician to speak on sim- plicity in mathematics. Nevertheless it must strike most physi- cists that in the progress of mathematics from algebra and geome- try to higher analysis new concepts have been steadily added and whatever gain there has been in simplicity has been largely in the direction of economy and utility for the sake of which the scientist has been willing to pay the price of increasing abstractness. Since the preceding analysis has been rather destructive of the purely numerical criterion of simplicity in physics, it is only fair to try to meet the question of the meaning of this idea on more positive grounds. No one denies that physicists continually refer to one theory as simpler than another. They must mean something by this. If this something cannot be reduced to a strictly numerical basis, what then does it mean? It will hardly do to dismiss it as utterly illusory. We are here strongly tempted to return to the "economy of thought" stressed by Mach as one of the great contributions of scientific method to human activity. With its system of prin- ciples and laws physical science makes possible the intellectual mastery of nature to an extent inconceivable to the mind accus- tomed to look upon each natural event as unrelated to every other one; it makes it possible to teach an intelligent, industrious college student within a year to solve with ease problems which would</page><page sequence="16">166 Simplicity in Physics have given considerable difficulty to Aristotle and would very likely have been solved incorrectly by him, if solved at all. The tremendous practical applications of science all attest the mar- velous economy of mental effort inherent in the method of physics. It is just as if the human mind in the process of evolution were always striving to achieve an understanding of natural phenomena in the shortest possible time and with the least mental effort, i.e., in a way which does not involve the retaining in the memory of an enormous number of isolated facts but replaces all these by a few great generalizations to be manipulated and elaborated at will by means of logical reasoning. Applying this notion to our present problem it thus appears that we can find a criterion for simplicity in physics which may not turn out to be illusory by recourse to the following pragmatic judgment. Of two theories descriptive of the same range of physical experience that is the simpler which demands the shorter time for the normally intelligent person to become sufficiently familiar with it to such an extent as to obtain correct and useful results. No question is here involved of the precise type of concepts employed, of their number, of the number of funda- mental postulates or finally of the special mathematical schemes employed in making deductions. If, for example, a person familiar with classical mechanics can become equally well ac- quainted with another physical theory in a time of the same order of magnitude as that which he took to learn mechanics, he should consider this new theory as simple as mechanics, no matter how complicated it may seem at first examination to one un- familiar with it. Human life is short and time is fleeting. In endeavoring to understand the world around us we must make the most of the brief span allotted. We must therefore build our theories in such a way that, with given intellectual background, the manipulation of these theories leads in minimum time to success in physical prediction. It must, of course, be confessed that this disposition of the meaning of simplicity in physics leads to the result that due to individual differences among scientifically minded people sim- plicity must ever remain essentially an individual judgment: a</page><page sequence="17">R. B. Lindsay I67 theory which is simple to one will not appear so to another. Nevertheless past experience would tend to show that gradually as a matter of successive approximations points of view have arisen which are more readily assimilable by normal human brains, i.e., more readily learned, than earlier ones. These then have become part of the more or less "stable" and at least "quasi- permanent" body of physical thought. There is no reason to doubt that this process will continue. As new theories arise for the description of newly acquired phenomena they too by the great sifting process forever going on will take their proper place. And in turn we shall ultimately consider them simple when we have grown sufficiently familiar with them to forget that they ever seemed difficult to understand. Brown University, Providence, R.
