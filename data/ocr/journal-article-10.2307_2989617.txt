<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHORTER NOTICES PROPERTY: A STUDY IN SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY. By E. Beaglehole. London: Al- len &amp; Unwin, 193I. Large 8vo. Pp. 327, Index. ios. 6d. net. This is the first of a series of "Studies in Sociology" published under the auspices of the London School of Economics. The young author is to be con- gratulated upon a very useful statement of the problem and some illuminating conclusions with regard to it. He maintains that there is no specific instinct of acquisition, the acquiring of certain valuables being incidental to their separate usefulness. His analysis begins with the insects and deals with primitive peoples only after half the book is completed. But his summary of the effect of a social "pattern" upon the customs connected with property is effective. He seems to overestimate the value of Freud's contribution to social psychology: but he does not accept uncritically the Freudian theory of the delight in excrement as connected with the habit of collectors. The general effect of the book is to show how varied the actual practice is, in different societies, with regard to property. The author emphasizes the primitive or simple psychology connected with property; but he does not attempt to analyze the more complicated psycho- logical states underlying the law of property in highly civilized communities. The book is valuable for students of ethics, and it should be followed by further studies by the same author, carrying his theories further. C. D. B. THE SCIENTIFIC OUTLOOK. By Bertrand Russell. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 193I. PP. x+-277. $3.00. Mr. Russell here talks, divertingly as usual, of the nature of scientific knowl- edge, of the extension of the scientific technique in ever enlarging fields, and finally of the resulting society. Though he draws a portentous picture of a hypothetical society fathered by strict science, it cannot be said that he ad- vances at any point the comprehension of the informed man as to either of the three subjects discussed. For the lay reader, perhaps for even the Freshman in college, his explication of the nature of the scientific method around the life and work of Galileo, Newton, Darwin, and Pavlov is plain and illuminating. But there is more obvious effort to be clever than is palatable. And while there are elements of ruthlessness in our society that conceivably might become tendencies in the direction of the forbidding outcome here pictured, they are not in any demonstrable sense elements of science or indications of the outlook</page><page sequence="2">386 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS of science. In distinguishing between the great scientists who have been mo- tivated by truth and lesser men motivated by power, Russell is preparing the hat out of which will come just what he wants at the proper time to stage a cli- max. But to speak of cause rather than of effect, it is not improbable that the limitation of Russell's kinaesthetic familiarity with science to the most imper- sonal and abstract of the sciences, mathematics, leads him to underestimate the humaner activation of the biological, not to mention the social, sciences. Having separated feeling and value from science, he has to bring them in as a luxury at the end. Though he manufactures fear and fastens it upon science, his emphasis is sound; for he sees that obscurantism is no alternative to even the excesses of knowledge. T. V. S. JOACHIM OF FLORA. By Henry Bett. London: Methuen &amp; Co., I93I. Small 8vo. Pp. i84, Index. 6s. net. This is a valuable study of the visionary who affected medieval thought, especially among the so-called "Spiritual Franciscans." Joachim's doctrine is, like so many others, a metaphorical re-interpretation of early Christian creeds- and it has no philosophical value. But the effect of such doctrines in social life, and even in the lives of thinkers, is important. Mr. Bett describes very vividly the issues, as they appeared in the University of Paris in the fourteenth century. The practical difficulties which the Papacy had to face when enthusiasts became reckless of social consequences are well stated; and Mr. Bett's contribution, therefore, is valuable indirectly for the study of moral theory. C. D. B. FORMAL LOGIC. A SCIENTIFIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEM. By F. C. S. Schiller. London: Macmillan, I93I. (2d ed.) Large 8 vo. Pp. 423, Index. I2S. 6d. net. A second edition of Mr. Schiller's book on formal logic is a sign of the times. He is justified in treating the demand for his book as an indication of the dis- comfort felt by many at the ridiculous unreality of the traditional logic. He brings a very vivid and interesting mind to bear upon the old forms; but whether he has distinguished metaphysics from psychology as well as Aristotle did may be doubtful. C. D. B. Is DIVINE EXISTENCE CREDIBLE? By Norman Kemp Smith. (Annual Lecture, British Academy.) Oxford: Oxford University Press, I93I. Pp. 28. IS. 6d. net. This short essay deals very ably with the sort of evidence upon which belief in "the Divine" may rest. The difficulty of believing in "God," in any of the traditional senses of the word, is said by the author to be no obstacle to belief in "the Divine." Undoubtedly it is felt by many that there is a mysterious and vast element in Nature and Man; and this perhaps may be called "the Divine." C. D. B.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 387 THE GENEvA EXPERIMENT. By W. E. Rappard. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 193I. Pp. II5. 5s. net. This small book contains a very clear and cogent account of the principles underlying the League of Nations. Professor Rappard has had an intimate con- nection with the League since its foundation, and he thinks in practical terms. He reviews shortly the chief functions which have been undertaken by the League, and carries his references to actual events as far as May, I93i. He points out that the League has succeeded in solving disputes only where the parties to the dispute have been willing to co-operate in its efforts. The sterner test is still to come. C. D. B. PROBLEMS OF PEACE. Lectures delivered at the Geneva Institute of Internation- al Relations, August, I930. Oxford: Oxford University Press, I93I. Pp. 332. Price 8s. 6d. net. The lectures in I930, which continue a series begun in I926, were delivered by Professor Andre Siegfried, Professor Gilbert Murray, Professor J. L. Brierly, Sefior Madariaga, and others. The subjects are largely problems of machinery and the history of the League; but there is a more general interest in Professor Zimmern's final lecture on "Education for World-Citizenship." C. D. B. THE EMERGENCE OF MAN. By Gerald Hurd. London: Jonathan Cape, I93I. Large 8vo. Pp. 303, Index. ios. 6d. net. This is a popular account of human history intended by the author to stand for optimism, in place of the pessimism of Winwood Read's well-known Martyr- dom of Man. It omits to mention music, painting, and the other fine arts; it contains a travesty of scholastic philosophy and a conventional view of Renais- sance learning. But the author evidently belongs to the "age of faith" in what the nineteenth century called "science." The book is a very unsafe guide to civilization. C. D. B. ESSAYS ON RESEARCH IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES. By W. F. G. Swann, Walter Wheeler Cook, Charles A. Beard, John Maurice Clark, Karl N. Llewellyn, Madison Bentley, Arthur M. Schlesinger, William F. Ogburn, and William I. Thomas. Washington: Brookings Institution, I93I. Pp. 194. These essays are lectures delivered before the general seminar at the Brook- ings Institution on the subject of method in the social sciences. Though one or two of the essays are rather thin, several of them give sound and inspiring state- ments of general principles, and at least three (those of Professors Clark, Llewellyn, and Thomas) discuss in a serious fashion specific problems of meth- odology. CHARNER M. PERRY</page><page sequence="4">388 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS SICK SOCIETY. By A. J. I. Kraus. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Pp. X+206. $2.00. The sickness of society is diagnosed as being the result of the subordination of the power of culture to the cult of power. Such health as society possesses is the result of social telesis, under whose influence "groups organized to attain power receive the impress of social culture and develop values and relationships having definite social purposes." Social telesis is defined as "the normative, organizing force that creates categories involving social power and forms them into one unified social system which holds complete sway within the boundaries of spatial society." The dominating control of social telesis is, however, not absolute. Certain groups are characterized by a deficiency of power, and others, such as the state, by an excess of power. These latter groups may exercise their power for its own sake or in directions other than those indicated by culture and ethics, in which case the power of culture becomes subordinated to the cult of power. "From the conflict between these two major forces-ethics and economics-resulted the whole tragedy of the cultural values of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. When the two are in harmony, otherwise unrestrained economic activities are controlled for ethical purposes." When these two forces are not in harmony, social amelioration attempts to eliminate the discrepancy. CHARNER M. PERRY SELECTIONS FROM MEDIEVAL PHILOSOPHERS. By Richard McKeon. (Vol. I, "The Modern Student's Library.") New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, I93I. Pp. xx+375. According to the author, in the making of these selections the problem of knowledge has been chosen as the problem whose evolution through the centuries is to be followed. This first volume includes passages from the writings of nine philosophers, from St. Augustine to Albert the Great. Each selection is pre- ceded by a biographical or bibliographical note. CHARNER M. PERRY THE HISTORIC DEVELOPMENT OF LOGIC. By Federigo Enriques. Translated by Jerome Rosenthal. New York: Henry Holt &amp; Co., I93I. Pp. Xi+ 27I. This volume is not a history of traditional logic, but rather a critical exposi- tion of the development of an understanding of scientific principles and scien- tific method. In the short chapter on the logic of the ancients more attention is given to Euclid than to Aristotle. Though a chapter is devoted to the con- tributions made during the early modern period, more than half of the volume is taken up with recent development resulting from scientific progress, mainly in mathematics. The two main chapters are "The Reform of Contemporary Logic," and "From Inductive Logic to the Logic of Scientific Systems." CHARNER M. PERRY</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 389 PRINCIPLES OF ETHICS. By James H. Dunham. New York: Prentice-Hall, Inc., I929. Pp. xiii+570. $3.00. Without discussing primitive morality, the history of ethics, or practical problems, Professor Dunham has managed to fill the pages of a very stout vol- ume. When it is added that he does not go in for theoretical subtleties or unduly rigorous and lengthy analysis, it will be evident that his presentation of ethical principles is indeed comprehensive and systematic. Part I discusses the nature of the moral act and of the moral self, and such relevant topics as desire and the control of desire by judgment. The chief points here are that the moral self is purposive and self-directing; that moral acts are acts which involve purpose, express character, and include a recognition of right and wrong; and that moral judgment is concerned with the whole concrete act including motive, intent, and action. Part II discusses hedonism, Kantianism, the ethics of evolution, etc. After criticizing these various "methods," the author arrives at a synthesis in which good conduct is defined as that which aims at good character, character being "the systematization of desires interpreted by reason and crowned by emo- tional satisfactions." Part III, "The Problems of Ethics," includes discussions of such problems as the nature of moral knowledge, freedom, duties, self-sacri- fice, and moral rehabilitation. Part IV outlines the sanctions of ethics-physical sanctions, sympathy, reputation, conscience, law, education, aesthetics, and religion. CHARNER M. PERRY TIME STOOD STILL: I914-I9i8. By Paul Cohen-Portheim. New York: E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., 1932. Pp. Vii+235. $3.00. A straightforward account of the experience of a sensitive German civilian interned in England during the War. The title represents the ever-present prob- lem in prison camps-uprooted from familiar moorings, men found time so much with them as to become their master. England appears quite as much "the Unknown Isle" from the point of view of this, as of the author's previous, book. For the most part, the story is objectively told, though one chapter recounts the author's own psychological metamorphosis-from extraversion to almost com- plete introversion. The sociological effects of isolation, the psychological effects of lack of privacy, the moral effects of the war spirit-these are the notable by- products of the book. Besides, it is a fascinating story, told without rancor and with little sentimentality. T. V. S. SINCLAIR LEWIS: OUR OWN DIOGENES. By V. L. Parrington. SIGRD UNDSET: A NORDIC MORALIST. By Victor Vinde. Seattle: University of Washington Chapbooks, Nos. 5 and 45. These chapbooks are studies of the ethical and sociological implications of the work of two moralists. Vinde falls too often into discursive moralizing and loose rhetoric and unduly simplifies the quality of Undset's really rich and varied</page><page sequence="6">390 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS thought. She emerges as no more than a purveyor of erotic tragedy. Parring- ton's account of Mr. Lewis's disgust with America and America's disgust with Mr. Lewis suffers from an irony so mobile as to be nugatory. Neither a Rotari- an or a Menckenian could be at all sure of the drift of Parrington's thought. The mind of the writer was far too absolutist to be at home in the ironic mode. One hopes that the University of Washington will reprint his much superior article on Mr. Cabell. E. K. BROWN BUDDHISM IN INDIA, CEYLON, CHINA AND JAPAN. By Clarence H. Hamilton. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, I93I. Pp. I07. $I.00. An excellent introductory syllabus prepared for beginning students by the professor of Eastern philosophy in Hartford Theological Seminary (now profes- sor at Oberlin College). Salient topics chronologically arranged are outlined; meat for the bones is to be sought in the carefully selected references inserted throughout and in an extended Bibliography appended. The social and intel- lectual background of early Buddhism, the life of the founder, his teaching, early orders: these are some sample topics. More than one student (and even teacher) of comparative and historical religion will bless the name of this author for preparing this pamphlet. VERGILIUS FERM THE PERSON OF EVOLUTION. By W. D. Lighthall. Toronto: Macmillan Co., I930. Pp. 216. This is a Jules Verne type of metaphysics. The very style fits the fantastic picture drawn: paragraphs jumbled together, connected by numbers, unfinished sentences, patched quotations, a bolshevistic handling of terms and the manu- facturing of new, and an air of fanatical cocksureness throughout. We are told to believe in a "teleology of joy," in an "outer consciousness," in an "instinct" of altruism, in a dream state of all animal life, in a "protoplasmic cousinhood," in an "Outer P. space," in a "hyperpsych," in an "Evolution" (reified and capi- talized) as the "great Directive Power," in a "Tree of Personality"-sufficient is a taste thereof. The whole cosmos, it is alleged, is full of life and personality; we form parts of an Outer Person with whom we are one though we do not always "coalesce." The arguments for this panpsychistic-theistic metaphysics are raked together from biology, psychology, sociology, biochemistry, ethics, astrophysics, with quotations from "the authorities." Little is said of the dys- teleologies of nature; nothing is said of the recent experimental biology which is throwing overboard the orthogenesis theory (e.g., the important experiments of Professor Muller and the evidence of mutations occurring in all directions) and which has an important bearing on any up-to-the-minute teleological dis- cussion. The author assures us that "the distinctive thoughts in the present work are not derived from others." Of this we are fully convinced. VERGILIUS FERM CosMIc RELIGION. By Albert Einstein. New York: Covici Friede, Inc., I93I. Pp. I09. $I.50. A little book gotten up by enterprising publishers who write a snappy bio- graphical note of Einstein, print excerpts from George Bernard Shaw's London</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 39I testimonial (which we heard over the radio in October, I930) and brief Ein- steinian utterances on pacifism, disarmament, Jews, together with his random remarks on subjects ranging from music to mass psychology. The essay on "Cosmic Religion" is familiar to readers of the Sunday New York Times Maga- zine. The cosmic religious sense is identified with the pure scientist's reaching out to touch the totality of existence, his wrestling with the secrets of nature without thought of gain or the practical consequences and quite devoid of any anthropomorphic notions of Deity. Undoubtedly this is religious experience and definitions will have to make room for it. VERGILIUs FERM THE WAY OF THE SCEPTIC. By Rev. John E. Graham. New York: Lincoln MacVeagh; Dial Press, I93I. Pp. 316. The Way of the Sceptic is a Catholic reply to Mr. Mencken's A Treatise on the Gods. In this defense of Christianity, Rev. Graham corrects the biased and superficial notions of the INTELLIGENTSIA on matters religious and Christian. He presents, therefore, the Catholic point of view on such topics as the nature, origin, and evolution of religion; the Catholic church's attitude toward the Bible; mysticism; celibacy; monks; Christianity and paganism; the mass; ex- communication; invocation of saints; "outside the Church there is no salva- tion"; miracles; evolution; and the conflict between theology and science. Throughout, the discussion is carried on in a scholarly and objective manner. One could wish that the critics of religion and Christianity were as scholarly and as objective. The chief criticism brought against the intelligentsia in their at- tack on Christianity is that their knowledge of it, and matters religious, is superficial and biased. The books and articles which they write on religion are superficial and extremely prejudiced. Furthermore, their contention that "all religions, at bottom, are pretty much alike" and that religion and magic are interchangeable terms is false. We concur in this criticism. It is, of course, true that there is similarity between religions; yet that is not what distinguishes them. Religions are known by and valued for their differences. It is for these differences that men are willing to lay down their lives. We do not believe it necessary, however, to assume, as the author does, an original pure religion from which all others sprang and that the similarities between Christianity and paganism are traceable to this original religion. The rejection of this assumption does not involve the rejection of God. We recommend this book to the intel- ligentsia and their followers and to all none-too-well-informed Protestants on Catholic theology and practices. ADAM ALLES QUESTIONS OF THE DAY. By Rev. John A. Ryan. Boston: Stratford Co., I93I. PP. 333. Dr. Ryan's Questions of the Day is a compilation of short papers, articles, and book reviews on prohibition, Catholics and politics, economic questions, and miscellaneous topics. The discussion of prohibition brings nothing new to the reader. Dr. Ryan is opposed to it on constitutional and moral grounds (it takes</page><page sequence="8">392 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS away the individual's freedom). The chapter on the "Anti-Saloon League" might have been written more sympathetically. In short, the whole discussion of prohibition is very much in the spirit of the anti-prohibitionist. The papers on Catholics and politics bring us the presidential campaign issues of I928. Those who ardently championed the cause of ex-Governor Smith and the wets will be pleased by these articles; those who favored Mr. Hoover and the dry cause will be extremely vexed by Dr. Ryan's remarks; whereas those who are less passionately interested in politics and anti-prohibition propaganda will be extremely bored by the rehearsing of political propaganda. The papers on eco- nomic questions and miscellaneous topics were of greater interest to the review- er. In these Dr. Ryan discusses, among others, public utilities, unemployment, Catholicism and liberalism, the new morality and its illusions, birth control, human sterilization, evolution and equality. His judgments on these topics are based on morality. Thus, on ethical grounds, the investor in public utilities "has a right to expect that public regulation will not reduce the valuation of the concern below the number of dollars that he has invested." But this does not entitle him to higher dividends due to revaluation in accordance with reproduc- tion cost (p. I59). It is also on moral grounds that he objects to the new moral- ity, to birth control, and to human sterilization; in this last problem even con- stitutional rights are involved which entitle the individual to protection. ADAM ALLES CONTEXT AND THOUGHT. Howison Lecture for I930. By John Dewey. Berke- ley: University of California Press, I93I. Pp. 23. $0.25. Under a new and fruitful title Mr. Dewey here vivifies with anthropological material and common sense his well-known emphasis upon the inadequacy, but necessity, of analysis as an intellectual technique. Sound thinking is not analysis followed by synthesis but analysis in continuing appreciation of its ever present context. Meaning is identified with symbolism, and symbolism is made dependent upon the context. Generalized, the argument eventuates into logic as the orientation of symbols in their before-and-after-and-all-around con- text and into philosophy itself conceived as criticism-"criticism of the influen- tial beliefs that underline culture." The scenery along the way is, in this case, as in all cases where seminal minds voyage, hardly less rewarding than is the destination. T. V. S. OUTLINES OF THE HISTORY OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY. By Eduard Zeller. Thir- teenth ed. Revised by Dr. Wilhelm Nestle and translated by L. R. Palmer, Trinity College, Cambridge. "The International Library of Psychology, Philosophy, and Scientific Method." New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., I93I. Pp. xv+324. $5.00. Zeller's Outlines was published in i883 "to provide students with a help for academic lectures." Dr. Nestle in the twelfth edition added footnotes to bring the book abreast of critical advances. In this new edition he does a more radical revision of the entire work to enable it to serve anew the author's original</page><page sequence="9">BOOK REVIEWS 393 intention. Leaving it basically still the work of Zeller, by careful rewriting of approximately half the book Dr. Nestle presents it now as quite cognizant of recent scholarship, divested of its original polemical material, and more ade- quately oriented than before in Greek culture. With what seems an excellent translation, it will be welcomed by teachers of Greek philosophy. It might well expect a wide classroom use in America if the price were within popular reach. More scholarly than any of the American tests, it is less interestingly written. Robin's Greek Thought compares best with it, and in the estimation of some is superior to it certainly in style if not also in grasp. T. V.S. THE ETHICS OF A PROFESSION. By A. P. Richardson. New York: Century Co., I93I. Pp. I59. This book deals with the ethics of accounting, a fact which should have been indicated in the title. The author proceeds to develop the practical ethical problems confronting this particular profession and to offer suggestions for their solution. The latter are largely of a reasonable type, but also imply a certain amount of authority which is not wholly sustained by the convincing qualities of experience. No attempt is made to refer to other professions by way of anal- ogy or comparison. The self-contained character of the book, uncritical and almost unconscious of the bearings of the presented materials, limits its use to the young accountant who feels the need of some paternal advice. There is need of such books. But the student of ethics will have to subject the material to a considerable amount of critical refining before he can use what little may remain after such processing. C. F. TAEUSCH SCHOPENHAUER, PESSIMIST AND PAGAN. By V. J. McGill. New York: Bren- tano's, I93I. Pp. 3I2. In this volume Dr. McGill has given us the most readable and illuminating biography of Schopenhauer in the English language. Entering with sympathy, albeit with open eyes, into Schopenhauer's complex personality, he places before the reader not a dry catalogue of dates and doings, but a warm and living picture of the man and the philosopher. That picture succeeds in making appear natu- ral and inevitable the startling combinations of opposites in the character of the famous pessimist. Without attempting to give any but the broadest sketch of his philosophy, it nevertheless affords the reader an insight into the process of development of his thought and the influences that acted upon it. Students of Schopenhauer's philosophy who read this biography will be made to feel a little as if they had known him personally and had gathered from his own lips the thoughts they found in his works. C. J. DUCASSE JOHN CALVIN, THE MAN AND HIS ETHICS. By Georgia Harkness. New York: Henry Holt &amp; Co. Pp. xiii+ 266. $3.00. Although containing a short history of his life and a note on his theology, this book is devoted primarily to Calvin's ethics. It is the first of its kind in English.</page><page sequence="10">394 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS It is well documented and based upon original sources, chiefly the fifty-nine volumes of the Calvini Opera. Puritanism derives largely from Calvinism and Calvinism derives from Calvin. Says Professor Harkness, "Frail in body, gigan- tic in intellect, and iron-clad in soul, he laid the stamp of his personality on future Calvinists, and others. He was a man of great faults and great virtues; and these faults and virtues were crystallized into a moral code which after four centuries is still effective in our social order." As the story unfolds, Calvin's unloveliness is all too apparent despite the author's attempt to brush him clean. Doubtless his faults were those of the time -that is, were possessed also by some others of his time. But Calvin was a fighter who, having fought his way to the top, fought to stay there. He was a religious fanatic with God-given power to punish, even to kill. And his "tower- ing intellect" was too much used for Menckian onslaughts against his opponents and rationalizations savoring of dishonesty. Negatively in his favor is his dis- charge at the hands of Professor Harkness from responsibility for the evils of capitalism, although he helped create the system. Also in his favor is his further- ance of education if only because this was to mean eventually the downfall of such authoritarianism as his. L. M. PAPE PHILOSOPHIE UND WAHRHEIT. SPEZIELLE EINLEITUNG IN DIE ALETHEIOLOGIE. By Schalwa Nuzubidse. Berlin W. 35 und Koenigsberg, Pr.: Ost-Europa Verlag, I93I. Pp. 2I8. Mr. Nuzubidse is professor of philosophy at the University of Tiflis. Never- theless his thinking is under great influence of Western, especially German, philosophy, of which he shows a deep and thorough knowledge. Perhaps there are some underlying influences of the wisdom of the Orient, but the author does not reveal them as such. The present volume develops further the theories on alethiology, which the author exposed previously in his work entitled Wahrheit und Erkenntnisstruktur (Berlin, I926). The aim of alethiology is to analyze not the futile conception of the Wakrheit an sick but the idea of the Wahrheit fur uns and to define the position of the human being toward esse and percipi. At the same time this theory sees philosophy as a movement toward perfection, avoid- ing in this way the static and dogmatic structure of German idealism. The author reproaches Western philosophy with being too much systematized and scholastic. The attempt to overcome this, made by phenomenology and other modern German schools, suffers from inner emptiness, caused by their indeter- mination. Clear observation always results in the recognition of the boundaries which limit human and individual thinking. Greek and still more German philosophy has suffered from the idea that absolute knowledge is obtainable. This one-sided idealism makes life perfectly sterile. Philosophy has to be brought back to its function as an activity toward perfection and greater wisdom. The elaboration of these ideas, in comparison with the different sys- tems of philosophy, is highly interesting. In his criticism of Plato, however, the author seems to overlook the more dynamic features of Plato's philosophy.</page><page sequence="11">BOOK REVIEWS 395 The controversy with Heidegger, which will be further developed, belongs to the most stimulating parts of the book. To purify philosophy of its speculative and intuitive parts and to see it again as a way toward wisdom, is certainly a very important contribution toward a simpler solution of the overcomplicated problems of modern philosophy.
