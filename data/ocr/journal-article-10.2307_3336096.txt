<plain_text><page sequence="1">CROSS RIVER TOMBSTONES D. R. ROSEVEAR The photographs in this article were taken with a glass-plate camera be- tween the years 1929 and 1931, when I was serving as the forest officer in charge of Ogoja Province, my headquarters being the then very insignificant and remote government station of Ikom. They were all developed under trying conditions in mud rest-houses, and until recently I thought that they had suffered the fate of most of my negatives in being smashed in the course of years of rough travel up and down West Africa. To my surprise I came across these ten early records unharmed, and though they are not up to today's exacting photographic standards it seems worthwhile to give some permanence to an aspect of Cross River culture that has received little or no attention. Tombstones of this type came into common fashion along the upper Cross River in the 1920s, though one (Fig. 4) seems to bear an earlier date, 1911. As a forester I was not concerned with an- thropological documentation, and I have no idea who made them. All I know is that in that area were scattered the tiny remnants of a couple of dozen or more peoples, often confined to a single village and, according to my forest guards, quite unable to under- stand the language of their immediate neighbors. These monuments were to be seen in a number of the more impor- tant trading villages where the deceased had had sufficient financial or social standing to merit considerable funeral expense and a notable memorial. The inventiveness of design was wide. All were made of cement and often incor- porated favorite articles of the deceased or objects intended to underline his wealth. The artist occasionally im- pressed the epitaphs by means of a ce- ment lettering set, but mostly he either scratched letters into the still damp ma- terial or painted them; in the last case they tended to disappear in a relatively short time. 1 The most common design motif was an abstract human figure, one hand pointing to heaven (Figs. 1, 6, 7, 10). This basic design seems to have under- gone some very interesting changes. For certain of the artists, it became more and more stylized so that the legs came to curve upward or were not repre- sented at all, and the head became simplified into a triangle, in some cases severely reduced (Figs. 2, 5). No conces- sion was made to sex, monuments for men and women following the same pattern. Other tombstone forms seem to be founded on the Celtic cross (Irish Roman Catholic missionary influence?) and the pointed Gothic window (Fig. 3), inspired by pictures of churches. Im- pressed and painted foliage motifs occur on two headstones of the latter type in Figure 3, and a peculiar image that seems to be a highly simplified mask with eyes and a large mouth appears be- tween the leaf designs. A corner of the graveyard at Okuni, an important trading town, contains exam- ples of these basic types. In Figure 2 the two memorials are in stylized human form, one with downwardly directed and curved arms, which are most unusual, and legs reduced to mere stumps. The head is a triangle with one circular socket of such size as probably to have once ac- commodated a wristwatch. The torso bears an impressed cross, and below it, rather unexpectedly, there is a heart with an arrow through it. The painted inscrip- tion was starting to become faint at the time I photographed it: "In loving mem- ory of Ossimu . . . (obliterated detail) . . . 12th February 1921 age 25 years." In the adjacent gravestone the arms point to the sky, but there are no legs. The triangular head has three impressed holes. This is a memorial to "Chief Osim Abung died 22nd Nov. 1919." Other examples in another part of the Okuni graveyard (Fig. 3) appear to be de- rived from the Celtic cross in various stages of simplification. The tombstone facing front on the left is the most com- plete and has a trifoliate motif on each arm of the cross. It is dated "21-7-26." In the adjacent one to the right, which bears an earlier date of 1920, exactly the same trifoliate decoration occurs, but no circle connects the arms of the cross. In the example farther to the right, which ap- pears to have been done about 1919, the cross form is only just recognizable, and decoration consists of a raised heart on the upper arm. The tomb sideways at the extreme left is the Celtic model at its most reduced: a plain disc pierced with four holes, abstractions of the four negative spaces formed by the circle that links the arms on the neighboring cross. The two memorials resembling Gothic windows at the right are dated ten years apart, 1929 and 1919, but are so very closely similar in their impressed and painted foliate decoration and the grim mask as to give the strong impression of 1 -O . ....

More care, however, has obviously been taken with the in- cised lettering in the left-hand example, though its arithmetic is faulty: "In loving memory of Serah Eko. She was born in 1910 and died 10.2.29 aged 20." The graveyard at Okuni also houses a memorial with an iron bedstead built in at the head and foot (Fig. 4). Because of this the simple cross is set sideways to the grave instead of in its usual position at the head. The epitaph, occurring twice, on the body of the tomb and on the cross, had been deeply impressed using cement lettering dies. The numbers were scratched in except for the year, 1911, for which the letter "I" was used, the 9 made by adding a small in- cised circle at the top of the letter. "Scared [sacred] in the memory of Imo Ekpon age 50 years old. Died on Monday the 5th day of November 1911." This example is the earliest of the monuments recorded here, which possibly accounts for its more conventional form. The an- thropomorphic model apparently did not occur until just after the First World War, when there was a tremendous up- surge in trade, education, communica- tion, and many other aspects of modern life in Nigeria. An example at Nkom-Akpambe (Fig. 1) is in the much favored form of a human figure with one arm directed upward, the other akimbo, but it exhibits a few variations. The heavenward- pointing hand has four fingers instead of the conventional bifurcation, and there is a watch inset in the palm. The legs are fractionally more naturalistic than the square model seen in Figures 6 and 7. Fi- nally, the head is reduced to its simplest shape, and no attempt at facial depiction has been made. Unfortunately the painted inscription had partly disap- peared even in September 1929, when the photograph was taken, only five years after the erection of the tomb: "Eye Oioga die on 18 Febr. 1924... Olonyeam Akpa Eke Okposi. Expence ?3.12.9."2 A memorial from the graveyard of Abaragba (Fig. 6) is also in the common anthropomorphic form, with the right hand pointing skyward, the left on the hip; the legs, in their squareness, are highly stylized. The simplified disc head wears what is remarkably like a bowler hat but may represent a sun helmet, in common use at the time among Euro- peans and the richer African traders. The figure is raised on a four-tiered base that has two pewter coffee pots, possessions of the deceased, set into the lowest level. Although the incised epitaph may give sow 2 ! . ...?. . 3 4 oft</page><page sequence="3">us the only recorded name of a tomb art- ist, unfortunately it is no longer very clear. It appears to read: "His memory Osimeku died Jan 3 of 1923. He was love and dear to his son families and friends. This monument is made by Chief Enam Okpa. His brothers spent ?30." Figure 7 is in almost the same form ex- cept that the hat is not so clearly a bowler, having seemingly lost the back part of the brim. No possessions of the deceased are incorporated into the base. The re- semblance to Figure 6, even down to the form of the plinth, is otherwise so marked that one must conclude that the work came from the same hand. This memorial, however, was found at Okanga (Okana), so the artist must have been a recognized itinerant mason. Al- though the Okanga tombstone is an ear- lier work by two years, he took far more trouble to make the lettering for its epitaph neat and regular by inscribing horizontal lines as guides. The date, De- cember 20, 1920, is in a very interesting form: "Okana Town. Eka Osim. He died on XX.XII.XIX.XX. Founded by Chief Osim Ole." Well below all this is written "No. III," as though by 1920 they were starting to number the memorials. A simple stone at Abontakon (Fig. 8), inspired by the narrow pointed Gothic window, is notable for the deceased's black-faced luminous wristwatch inset into the surface and for its painted in- scription: "The memory of Agbor Bisong famous trader of Abontakon Ikom Dis- trict. Died on the 28th January." The year is obliterated but for part of a 2, perhaps indicating that it was made in the 1920s. A highly stylized human form was seen at Okanga (Fig. 5). In this example, both arms are upraised and end in con- ventional bifurcated hands. The depic- tion of the legs is unique in its repetition of that configuration, and the conven- tionalized pedal digits are also unusual. The much reduced head takes the trian- gular shape seen in Figure 2. By stressing the heavenly uplift in the arms and legs and by incorporating two crosses, the artist has underlined the fundamentally religious purpose of the monument while at the same time magnificently solving the sculptor's age-old problem of structural stability. The inscription, in- cised along the horizontal of the upper cross, reads: "Chief Asor Abe. Had dead on 24 of December 1923." Below this, continuing the memorial numbering seen in Figure 7, is written, "Okana sta- tion nombet [number] 5." A double memorial from Abaragba has a number of unusual features (Fig. 9). Both figures are anthropomorphic, but the main, larger, one is the only tomb in my experience that incorporates what looks to be a death mask on the usually featureless capital disc. There is a vivid realism about the face accorded by the painted black hair; the eyes, closed as in death, surmounted by convincing eye- brows; and the well-modeled nose, mouth, and ears, all correctly sited and in no way exaggerated as they are in most carved wooden masks. Addition- ally the artist "tattooed" tribal marks on the cheeks. The disc itself has been or- namented with dentils, giving it an em- phasis that, together with the religious nature of the memorial and its inscrip- tion, amounts almost to a halo. Both arms, angled at the elbows, are akimbo; the legs, on the other hand, have been reduced to rudimentary symbolic bos- ses. There is a large raised cross on the chest. The incised inscription starts on the disc at the right ear, continues down the left arm and up the right arm, and finally overflows onto the lower part of the body below the pectoral cross. It reads: "Her memory the late Oti Okpa died July 14th 1927. She was a catechism girl in R.C. Mission Abaragba. Ajom Eyam her brother spent ?15." The smal- ler figure takes the same form, including the dentate halo, but there is no molded face. The left arm is extremely curious; it emerges from the hip and angles up- ward, but stops short of the shoulder. Did the artist deliberately exercise artis- tic license, preserving a degree of sym- metry with the main figure while creat- ing a heaven-directed signpost? The in- scription is: "The late Akujom Ayan is the son of Oti Okpa." The monument in Figure 10 was photographed in Mbaka in October 1930. From its general state of preservation I would guess that it had been up for no more than three to five years. The figure is markedly more realistic, with its navel and properly forked and shaped thighs, than those in Figures 6 and 7. The artist has also taken the trouble to give the arms rebated edges. The chief point of distinction, however, is the face, em- bossed with well-modeled eyes, nose, and mouth. While it is far from the realism seen in Figure 9-the ears, for example, have been brought forward and placed alongside the eyes-it is a great advance on the featureless disc common in other monuments of the an- thropomorphic type. These photographs were nothing more than a bringing together of a ran- dom assortment of things I recorded with my old plate camera during thou- sands of kilometers of trekking as a for- est officer in then little-known territory When it came to disposing of a multitude of gleanings from thirty years in what was then quite truly the "white man's grave," it seemed to me that consigning these pictures to the wastepaper basket might be premature-that they might, in a vastly changing world, prove of inter- est to future generations. They were taken with no deep or learned research in mind. In the 1920s Africa had not yet become the popular field for expert an- thropological investigation that it is to- day Few if any, apart from my old Resi- dent P. Amaury Talbot, laid claim to any such knowledge or ability. It was not until the early 1930s that certain district officers in remote areas-forced by a government anxious to show itself in the forefront of progress and to introduce "native administration" into the south- ern provinces of Nigeria-took a passing interest in matters ethnological and pro- duced a number of "organization re- ports" on the local peoples. It would be impertinent of me to pretend that my comments have any deeper value than the remarks of a traveler interested in the scenes and life of which he had become a small part, directing attention to matters that might otherwise be overlooked.

The present article, with revised text, is published for the benefit of readers of African Arts by kind permission of the Editor of The Nigerian Field. The rediscovery of the old negatives en- abled new prints to be made for the present publication, after which they were handed to the Horniman Museum, London, for safekeeping. Mr. Rosevear's characteristically modest reflections upon the photographs somewhat decry the rather high quality of several of them, and the un- doubted historical value of the entire set. "Over the years there have been a number of publica- tions concerning cement sculpture in southeast Nigeria (see Salmons 1980 for an assessment of this material), but they have been almost entirely confined to the Ibibio and An- nang areas of the Palm Belt. A very different style, the be- ginnings of which are described here, is currently in exis- tence and thriving in more northerly parts of Cross River State, especially around Ogoja and Ikom. I have to admit to not yet having published the results of relevant surveys I conducted there in the 1970s with Jill Salmons. This is un- fortunate in view of the relationship of this form of com- memorative sculpture to an earlier tradition for which the same area is justly renowned: that of the Cross River monoliths. I am also aware of the exciting implications of Mr. Rosevear's data, collected fifty to sixty years ago, for recent studies that have drawn attention to the central im- portance of gestural expression and funerary sculpture in African and Afro-American cultures (e.g., Thompson 1973, 1983; Thompson &amp; Cornet 1981; Vlach 1978.)." 1. The lettering was printed in capitals of varying quality but for convenience it has been rendered here in ordinary type. I have also rationalized punctuation to some extent; the actual inscriptions often have none at all or a dot be- tween each word. 2. Some of the "o" vowels carry a dot beneath them to in- dicate that the pronunciation is short, a method then be- ginning to make headway against the old-fashioned Eng- lish "aw."
