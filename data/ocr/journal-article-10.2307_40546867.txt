<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Second Fall of Man BY HAROLD KAPLAN Young Moses Herzog was chosen class orator for his commencement exercises at the McKinley High School in Chicago. He took his text from Emerson, and from that point on, he says, his credentials as an American "were in good order." He didn't lose his voice then, telling the Italian mechanics, Bohemian barrel makers, Jewish tailors "The main enterprise of the world, for splendor ... is the upbuilding of a man. The private life of one man shall be a more illustrious monarchy . . . than any kingdom in history. Let it be granted that our life, as we lead it, is common and mean .... Beautiful and perfect men we are not now . . . The community in which we live will hardly bear to be told that every man should be open to ecstasy or a divine illumination." The rest of Herzog is a comedy on this theme. The older Herzog accents his private life by writing unmailed letters to the great men of the world; these words, never read, never spoken, come out of silent, hungry anonymity, the surest note of average existence. Can this comic monarchy of one man's life win our respect? "Common and mean" it is, and yet it may be illustrious enough for Bellow's purposes. Emerson, like Herzog, converted a small private life to intellectual hyperbole, dared to talk with great minds, and assumed that all men could have such conversations and write their long letter to the world. But Herzog is a man of more passion than Emerson, and his creator has done more than most other modern writers to bring ideas out of flesh and blood and cast them again in the dramatic lives of men. It is not that his characters embody ideas, that is a common enough practice and in modern writing it often appears in proportion to the degree that the minds of the characters are limited. In other words they are not supposed to know what they symbolize, even when they symbolize a great deal. The effect is a little bit like dressing a dog in human clothing,</page><page sequence="2">The Second Fall of Man 67 it saddens the reader, he feels that he too might be this sort of toy in the play of someone's superior mind. But this is not usually the effect in Bellow; his important characters are almost implausibly intelligent and they do not carry more weight of implication than they have a chance of understanding themselves. In a sense this makes the job of the critic less rewarding than with other writers, since what everything means is pursued with a vigor and agility that outpaces the most ingenious reader. Yet it is that combination of high intelligence and a directness of approach to his characters and the reader that makes Bellow so appealing a writer. The intelligence is not the kind that swings everything its own way. In all his work ideas are in riot much the way they are in Herzog's mind. The literary intelligence is necessarily hostile to overbearing ideas, and much of Herzog's long dialogue with profound thinkers is aimed at overcoming their authority. Like Emerson he would liberate the mind, justify its play and its eccentric enterprise, and even make himself "open to ecstasy or a divine illumination." Thinking is an exercise in living, and his most audaciously thoughtful character, Henderson, comes to see that, "I want, I want," is the gist of every idea and every event in his life. The reader of Bellow is put into the position of saying to himself, I want, I want .... something great and complete in understanding and beyond my present wisdom. He looks at Bellow's text with that kind of anticipation but he is disallowed an easy enlightenment. What intellectual novelist has been less cant-ridden and obsessed with his own message? So broadly stated it seems unserious, but the theme of his work might be posed as a question, What do men want? Henderson learns an answer from his fat old African queen, "Gr√ºn tu molani," man wants to live. That redundancy is not debatable, particularly on a hot day in the African bush, with roaring lions and sickening drought to confirm its wisdom. Somehow there seems great clarity in it. Bellow's characters define themselves as human this way; it is a common essence, whether "wants" are for love, for money, for pride of mind and pride of strength, and whether they produce simple passion and anxiety or complex guilt. Tommy Wilhelm in Seize the Day does not draw his breath easily for one minute on that day he could not seize to live. There is no answer to Tommy's confusion, no sorting out of his "wants," though in the end he stands at the side of a dead man in a funeral parlor and gives all his tears to the dead stranger as surrogate for himself. It is a mistake to call this self-pity, though none of Bellow's characters is weaker or more of a</page><page sequence="3">68 HAROLD KAPLAN "slob," as Tommy's father has called him. They are the tears of self- recognition at a very bare point in his life, almost as biologically neutral as breathing. "Man wants to live;" from that source the spring of human sympathy flows. Herzog is only a bit less pathetic when he deals with angry vengeance, playing with the two puppet-like characters, his former wife and her lover, in the theater of his mind. The world is his melodrama and he is its crazed impresario, until a couple of ordinary events, things out of happenstance and clumsy human nature, break through his dream. All readers notice the significance of the scene where Herzog stands outside his house and watches his daughter being given her bath by his wife's lover, Gersbach. The man washed her tenderly. His look, perhaps, was false. But he has no true expressions, Herzog thought. Again it will not do to sentimentalize, or imply that Bellow sentimentalized this scene. Something sobering has partially returned Herzog to sanity, but it is as commonplace as the accident he later has while driving Junie home, further burdening the pathos of the divorced father's visit with his daughter. Here the traffic on the parkway, the rules of driving, the close danger, the cynical curiosity of the policemen all invade Herzog's consciousness and replace the passionate and resentful game he has been playing with ideas. It is not easy to exaggerate what has happened; the scene has more embarrassment and confusion for Herzog than anything else. His loaded gun has been discovered in the car and he is therefore led to the police station and eventually forced to confront his wife. Facing one's alienated wife in a police station, with the sergeant as audience, seems to be a wholesome experience. One might say that this is the way sanity is confirmed, through the clumsiness of events, the entanglement of authority, law, institutional process, the neutral witness of insensitive strangers. In a sense Herzog has been forced to adopt the external view, through his daughter, through the policemen, and even by way of the angry and contemptuous Madeline. One who has been so actualized cannot continue in fantasy, particularly that of the grieved husband with a gun. Even the gross and fraudulent Gersbach has been seen for a moment outside the immensely elaborated myth plus commentary that has been Herzog's version of the truth, ". . . . an actual person giving an actual bath, the reality of it, the tenderness of such a buffoon to a little child." How 'actuality' has replaced 'truth' can only be explained through the resources of fiction. The immanence of actual life was Joyce's theme as well, and his critics call such scenes as these "epiphanies," but in Bellow</page><page sequence="4">The Second Fall of Man 69 they have more moral weight - more of a need to redeem consciousness in his characters. Such a revelation is given by Augie March when after experiences, ideas, people, emotions, have unrolled without stint, almost without selection, his mind returns to focus, to what he calls the "axial lines of life." It is not entirely clear what he means, though he means something imposing when he uses words like harmony and joy and love. At any time life can come together again and man be regenerated. He will be brought into focus. He will live with true joy. Even his pains will be joy if they are true, even his helplessness will not take away his power, even wandering will not take him away from himself, even the big social jokes and hoaxes need not make him ridiculous, even disappointment after disappointment need not take away his love. Death will not be terrible to him iflifeisnot. Bellow does not allow any of his characters to venture so far in transcendental affirmations again. But as critics have pointed out, the writing of The Adventures of Augie March was a turning point in his development, particularly in his rejection of the life-inhibiting metaphysics of dread and the void in modern thought. His later works are less rhapsodic or lyrically self-confident, more addressed to a brilliantly ironic critique of nihilism, but moments like these of the "axial lines" break through and attest his need to locate the epiphanies of self-affirming life. Even in Augie March those "axial lines" are not the object of mystical intuition, though Augie himself seems to give that stress when he speaks of the "oldest knowledge, older than the Euphrates, older than the Ganges." Augie is something of an Emersonian when he thinks this way, but the spiritual exercise here is vague. The knowledge is more of a household knowledge, closer to the needs of survival. And in fact, discounting the convenience of being a "transcendentalist" in his own time, Emerson was equally mundane when it came to writing prescriptions for salvation. To borrow a phrase that Herzog likes, transcendence was more downward than upward with him, and if there is focus or anchorage in Emerson's imagination it has much to do with his own great respect for the immanence of the actual world. I ask not for the great, the remote, the romantic; I embrace the common, I explore and sit at the feet of the familiar, the low. Give me insight into to-day, and you may have the antique and future worlds. What would we really know the meaning of: The meal in the firkin; the milk in the pan; the ballad in the street; the news of the boat; the glance of the eye; the form and gait of the body;-</page><page sequence="5">70 HAROLD KAPLAN Herzog too would defy romantic and spiritual disillusionment, that cultivated malaise of the modern world. He says, for instance, that he is .... Convinced that the extent of universal space does not destroy human value, that the realm of facts and that of values are not eternally separated. What then? His answer to apocalyptic pessimism is rather stirring and perhaps a statement of Bellow's theme in this book. My life would prove a different point altogether. Very tired of the modern form of historicism which sees in this civilization the defeat of the best hopes of Western religion and thought, what Heidegger called the second Fall of Man into the quotidian or ordinary. No philosopher knows what the ordinary is, has not fallen into it deeply enough. The question of ordinary human experience is the principal question of these modern centuries One way or another the no doubt mad idea entered my mind that my own actions had historic importance .... Later Herzog directly challenges Heidegger to say when this second fall of man actually happened and where "we" were standing at the time. This is satire for heroicizing philosophies in their existential dramatics, but the question remains viable. Herzog's outcry is heard in the very depths of the quotidian; he has fallen into it over his head, and perhaps deeply enough to give his actions and reflections importance. Is it historic importance? One is tempted to say yes and consider the relevance of Bellow's critique of modern romanticism, for all its desperately destructive manifestations of a struggle with the quotidian. Herzog's own imagination has perhaps instructed him in how dangerous the imagination can be. More comedian than madman, though he is full of mad ideas, Herzog sits writing at his desk, wearing a new striped sport jacket, his new straw hat cutting his forehead, gripped desperately in the quotidian. His mistress Ramona has planned his new outfit; she is an expert in bed, expert in cooking delicious pre-coital and post-coital meals, an artist of the ordinary life. He sets his teeth, grasping the legs of his desk and writes, "Reason exists! Reason " and he writes, "Each to change his life. To change!" Bellow's exclamation points are marks for the reader's sympathy. They suggest not only the fall into the ordinary but the rise from it. They are demands, commands, expostulations which fill the universe, deny its silence. Herzog, shaving, looks into the mirror. My God! Who is this creature? It considers itself human. But what is it? Not human of itself. But has the longing to be human. And like a troubling dream, a persistent vapor. A desire. Where does it all</page><page sequence="6">The Second Fall Of Man 7 1 come from? And what is it? And what can it be? Not immortal longing. No, entirely mortal, but human. As he says, there is a necessity to prove that this creature has historic importance, or else all is lost. What is at stake, as it was for Emerson, is the fate of moral democracy itself if a positive assumption cannot be made on behalf of ordinary men. But the fact is that the world has been flooded with contempt and human self-hatred. Historically men may remember the context in which Bellow wrote as a literary era taking pride only in the extra-ordinary and sub-ordinary, and with a taste for extremes in experience and for such debasements and ennoblements of character that one might say a whole civilization was deranged. But the need for relief suggests why the age of the anti-hero is also an age of comedy. In Bellow's work since Augie March, comedy has always been close to the surface, breaking through with a delightful interception of bathos or extreme emotionalism or even moralism. When Herzog steals his father's gun with its two bullets for wife and lover, the inept piece of stage business in his life marks the limits of violence, he will never use it. The violence is in fantasy, where it should be. The extremism is anchored to the core of common sense and human ineptitude. Human ineptitude is Bellow's natural theme, if we take due regard of the rich tradition of losers and "schlemiels" in Jewish folklore and writing. The tradition of the loser has obvious significance in the modern fiction which alternates with the hysteria of supermen in writers like Lawrence, Hemingway, and Mailer. Bellow reserves not only mockery for the cult of existential heroics but a serious moral criticism. And if he prefers, like Kafka, to exaggerate human failure and entrapment, it is with a clear concern for universal implications. Tommy Wilhelm is the most concentrated of human failures, but the theme extends to Herzog, to Henderson, Sammler and Augie and to the many minor characters who are treated to a prolonged examination of their vulnerability. It comes dangerously close to a thesis like this: success dehumanizes, failure humanizes. His major characters are usually matched by people who have success, as Tommy is opposed and disliked by his father, sheltered in old age and immunizing himself from his son's failure. Augie's brother Simon is a success, training hard for it from early childhood, and as rough and hardskinned as one would expect for American business success in that time and place. But he is a tormented winner, as much as the losers like Herzog and Henderson are tormented, since winning itself is a superficial game and only accents frustration. The advantage of failure is that it prepares consciousness and response,</page><page sequence="7">72 HAROLD KAPLAN it makes a man morally amenable, suited for living in the society of others. The kind of cautionary fable which Bellow writes is fixed firmly in the American literary tradition. An individualist, expansionary culture magnified human possibilities exorbitantly and the classic writers of America reacted by exploring failure, or what the world called failure, almost as if they would give it a special moral description. The deeper issue was the challenge which democratic faith made to the self- confidence of the species. Emerson and Whitman, for instance, are often misunderstood as the apologists for heroic megalomania and a complacent, if not "imperialist" solipsism of the self.1 This is a distortion; self-assertion in their work is on behalf of the ordinary man. It has an obvious therapeutic function against threatening self- abasement, and the sting of egotism is removed in a way uniquely characteristic of classic American writing. No protagonist could be more generously inclusive than Whitman's, nor less aggrandizing than Thoreau's or Emerson's, if we could say that Emerson had a protagonist in his work. The emphasis is on an effort to find the moral common denominator of humanity, to think of heroism as a latency that endows all men rather than distinguishing a few. The relevance to this discussion is best seen however in the example of Melville. What were men worth, in their average existence, pushed to a degree of mediocrity and anonymity that reached the eccentric? Melville asked this question, understood the possible extremes, and the tendency of a democratic civilization to force apart the extremes. Captain Ahab made his choice for the most heroic self-statement, and he has many bizarre literary descendants in modern fiction. But so does Bartleby, the Wall Street scrivener and Dead-Letter Office clerk. Melville made Bartleby a distilled residue of humanity, more universal than any hero conceivable on Ahab's great stage. But even in Moby Dick the significant theme is not the great challenge of the whale hunt and the metaphysical martyrdom of Captain Ahab. It is rather his confrontation with ordinary humanity, a lifeline for castaways of either Ahab's megalomaniac extreme or Bartleby's passive surrender. Pip, the cowardly little cabin boy, and Starbuck, the prosaically cautious first mate, try to drag Ahab down to a human level and almost succeed. Their invitation is made noble and Ahab himself is not contemptuous of them. He is almost pulled from the track of the white whale by the look in a human eye, as he says, resisting the appeal of Starbuck. It is the look of dependency, an appeal from weakness, in little Pip's case, and Ahab 1. See Quentin Anderson, The Imperial Self (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1971).</page><page sequence="8">The Second Fall of Man 73 admits, touching thereby his true Shakespearean stature, that his mad strength and Pip's mad weakness might have cancelled each other out in an exchange that gave them both sanity. To think of Bellow in this context is most appropriate; it is certain that one of the ways in which he came to know himself as a writer has been through the Americans of the 19th century, as much as through Yiddish literature or Russian. However, the modern setting for his humanism takes into account an even greater widening of extremes and much greater deterioration of confidence in the value of average life. The age of the anti-hero is also the age of the anti-myth, and how much literary fury has aggravated the sense of loss, how much of modern literature is written in "a spirit of deepest vengefulness." With that latter remark Bellow was judging an era where humanity has practiced a kind of self- depreciation that is unique in the history of culture. Where heroes exist, in literary or popular versions, they must distance themselves in a strained or exorbitant fashion from ordinary human beings. For illustration Bellow brings attention to a hero-mongering character like Thea Fenchel in Augie March. She wants to transform Augie, as her lover, into a champion who could outmatch the animal pride and strength of her eagle, Caligula. The comedy dooms her to disappointment but we are to understand what is behind it. She couldn't stand most people "with their faulty humanity." And what her eccentricity amounted to was that she proposed a different kind of humanity altogether. I guess nothing restrains people from demanding ideal conditions. But what are her ideal conditions? The rapacity and natural violence of the eagle? The potency that can counter the venom of snakes? Some of this may actually need enactment in Thea's sexual fantasies, but deeper than that are the aspirations of the naturalist ethos, a religion really, which takes its values from nature. Modern naturalism, in the sense I am using the term, is based largely, and apart from its scientific authorization, on an abiding need to reject anthropomorphic creeds and homocentric illusions. It is an anti-humanism, in essence, and I see Bellow's own values being illuminated chiefly by his revulsion from typical expressions of naturalism, ranging from a neo-political and liberationist primitivism to the bleaker disciplines of the void, strangely related as they are. We might call them the positive and negative poles of naturalist thought, if we weren't already overloaded with terminology for the issue, which is best discussed through Bellow's own texts. The emphasis on primitivism (a turn which intellectual fashions took in the Sixties) is most directly treated in Mr. Sammler's Planet. More in</page><page sequence="9">74 HAROLD KAPLAN phase with the Forties and Fifties, in Herzog and Augie March, Bellow is absorbed with the moods of existential naturalism, the stoic or tragic cults of death and dread. Primitivism, with its pageantry of violence and instinctual liberation, is ultimately linked with what Herzog calls the "memento mori" philosophies in which death becomes nature's profoundest lesson. It defines consciousness, it is a constant presence, which, if forgotten, must be summed up to communicate the last metaphysical response possible for modern man. "It all goes back to those German existentialists," Herzog says, "who tell you how good dread is for you, how it saves you from distraction and gives you freedom and makes you authentic." Herzog calls this metaphysical posturing; existential man riding the abyss makes him irritably impatient. For a man packing a gun to kill his wife and her lover this is interesting. But Herzog always thinks ahead of himself. Even while immersed in his own melodrama he appraises the "memento mori" philosophies in their brutal simplicity. "God is no more. But death is. That's their story." But if death and dread were the whole story, Herzog, by his author's wish incapable of existential heroics, would have fallen below comedy into pointless and abusive ridicule. Perhaps the saddest degeneration of human consciousness is to reach the point where death and suffering have no dignity, not even a meaning, except as the expression of sadistic vengeance against a world without meaning. Herzog is Bellow's comic Meursault, comic Ivan Karamazov, and a parody of a thousand characters who have dramatized modern self-pity and self-abuse. But Herzog has looked at himself in the mirror and been able to say in wonder and awe, "My God! Who is this creature? It considers itself human. But what is it? Not human of itself. But has the longing to be human." It cannot be death that answers that longing. No, the dread which knows death cultivated only death, unless another awareness, as dramatically ultimate, as heavy with consequence, intervenes. Seeing himself in the mirror, Herzog is ready for another presence, that of "his brother's face." So he rushes on to insight, preaching to his friend Luke Asphalter. I really believe that brotherhood is what makes a man human. If I owe God a human life, this is where I fall down. 'Man liveth not by Self alone but in his brother's face.' .... When the preachers of dread tell you that others only distract you from metaphysical freedom then you must turn away from them. The real and essential question is one of your employment by other human beings and</page><page sequence="10">The Second Fall of Man 75 their employment by us. Without this employment you never dread death, you cultivate it. And consciousness when it doesn't clearly understand what to live for, what to die for, can only abuse and ridicule itself. The issue in this passage is a major historic question directed to our culture, whether men will choose to transcend death or not. To know what to live for, what to die for, is a transcendence in this sense, but transcendence has never been more difficult in human history. All non- fiction conspires against it, from daily journalistic reports to the magnificent mock-epic of scientific discovery, which first put forward the human anti-hero. Bellow'5 courage is great to allow his character to speak in terms of such simple traditional affirmations as human brotherhood, but the fall into ordinary humiliations may give Herzog the right. Comedy in modern culture can be its own antidote, that is, it may use ridicule in ways that reverse its direction and draw the poison out of human self-hatred. When a clown is led to say that men do not respect themselves, we are forced to listen. Herzog cries out, for instance, against the "disease of self-revenge" bred by our civilization.2 In this new reign of multitudes, self awareness tends to reveal us to ourselves as monsters. This is undoubtedly a political phenomenon, an action taken against personal impulse or against the personal demand for space and scope. The individual is obliged to define "power" as it is defined in politics, and to work out the personal consequences of this for himself. Thus he is provoked to take revenge upon himself, a revenge of derision, contempt, denial of transcendence. This last, his denial, is based upon former conceptions of human life or on images of man at present impossible to maintain. But the problem as I see it is not one of definition but of the total reconsideration of human qualities, or perhaps even the discovery of qualities Such discovery or recovery is only hampered by definitions which hold mankind down at the level of pride (or masochism), asserting too much and then suffering from self-hatred as a consequence. The danger of "asserting too much" should condition any reader's 2. The author stands behind Herzog on this theme. In an article for the Times Literary Supplement in 1960 he wrote that the modern consciousness was featured by an absence of a receptive place for creaturely love or sympathy. "The matter was put as strongly as possible by D. H. Lawrence. The sympathetic heart is broken/ he said, 'We stink in each other's nostrils/ That is, we cannot easily accept our own creaturely existence and that of others. And that is the fault of modern civilization, he tells us. We must in part agree, but the matter is so serious that we should be careful not to exaggerate. Our lives depend on it. Yes, there are good reasons for revulsion and fear. But revulsion and fear impair judgment."</page><page sequence="11">76 HAROLD KAPLAN search for what Bellow, speaking through Herzog, means by "transcendence." The spiritual content is small and the religious definitions which some critics make will not hold up. Herzog himself speaks of "images of man that are at present impossible to maintain" and the inference is clear that he refers to the traditional religious metaphysics. We must look elsewhere for modes of transcendence. The criticism of the "memento mori" philosophies is that they define man at the barest point of existential danger, as if all meaning is restricted to the self-consciousness of life on the verge of death. If an ethos develops from such assumptions, as of course it will from any metaphysical finality, it will maintain the flavor of death throughout, as in Sartre's case one might say death haunts making love as well as revolutions. Karl Jaspers, who saw the danger of posturing with "dread," was forced to headline the point in the title of a book, Tragedy is Not Enough. Abstract metaphysical anguish could hardly construct much on its own basis - though it did have the force of exposing conventional affirmations as inauthentic insofar as they departed from the great minus sign of reality - death. And so Bellow's meaning of transcendence cannot be found here. Herzog's dilemma is a central issue in the range of Bellow's work, even though it is fought out on a comic level of debate where big complexes of ideas like romanticism, nihilism, and existentialism are discerned to be two-thirds intellectual froth. In the important letter I have been quoting, Herzog is writing to Harris Pulver, his tutor at college, and the fact that "he loved the man in his own immoderate, heart-flooded way" supports the excited mind-flooded essay on "transcendence" and "the inspired condition" we now read. Listen Pulver, he wrote, a marvelous idea for a much-needed essay on the "inspired conditions." Do you believe in transcendence downward as well as upward? (The terms originate with Jean Wahl.) Shall we concede the impossibility of transcendence? The words to emphasize suggest that Herzog is doing his best to retrieve what he can for the "inspired condition." "Transcendence upward" is impossible; but then what is the meaning of "transcendence downward?" All that remains from traditional romanticism is the certainty that "we hate the world as it is." And this emphatic phrase, a clear statement of what is behind the inversions of romanticism, records Herzog's problem and Bellow's theme. Herzog is still comic as he invokes the "inspired condition" - "to know truth, to be free, to love another, to consummate existence, to abide with death in clarity of consciousness." The reality of his life abuses these terms ridiculously; he himself is the world we hate as it is.</page><page sequence="12">The Second Fall of Man 11 But that does not leave him without the thrust of inspiration, and we are still curious to know what he means by "transcendence downward." This is reinforced by his closing words to Pulver that transcendence is "no longer a rarified project." The technology of destruction has become absolute, and annihilation itself is no longer an imaginative possibility, a "metaphor," but a present danger. Neither then is the "inspired condition" a visionary matter, but a necessity of life. Herzog would not be Herzog if he could conclude his message to the world in a ringing summation. His mind may be at the end of its rational control, even as he interrupts and stops his essay with the words, "Reason exists! Reason "It is for the reader to make what he can of this headlong intellectual energy. Is it inspiration or intellectual comedy? Its pathos mixes them both, but there is a sober sequence of ideas here. The "inspired condition" is that which preserves and renews the records of transcendence, men's ideas of high value, their most generous ideas. Transcendence upward is barred and life without transcendence is impossible. But "transcendence downward" may be precisely located in that fall into the quotidian which modern man has so grievously and self-injuringly contemplated. No philosopher, Herzog has cried, has fallen into the ordinary deeply enough and "the question of ordinary human experience is the principal question of these modern centuries." We are justified in assuming that "transcendence downward" has a concern with ordinary human qualities. It is to be found in the "longing to be human" and in the process of becoming human. And this is the matter one has to consider if we put, as I think we should, an ambiguous and dialectical humanism at the center of Bellow's thought. It is a humanism purged of too close a tie to nature, not spiritual in its upward thrust, and not dependent on a social ideology or communal order. To perceive humanity in this way, marked out from nature and distinguished from civilization and all its works, is itself a transcendental concept. But the way it communicates itself would hardly take the mode of mystical intuition any more than it could be found in animal behavior or in a test tube. These extremes to be avoided, an obscurantist mysticism and a reductive naturalism, should help guide the bewildering flux of ideas in Bellow's chief intellectual protagonists who have my attention here, Herzog and Sammler. * The idea of transcendent humanity is the central matter that concerned Emerson, but Emerson had behind him the dominant values of his time, not only the surge of romantic idealism but also the political and economic individualism of expansionist America in the early</page><page sequence="13">78 HAROLD KAPLAN nineteenth century. Bellow and his characters are reacting to a great reversal of fortune for liberal humanism. In an article published in the year he was completing Herzog, Bellow described the war against the "old idea of the Self in modern culture, a war of strange allies, with art and literature leading the way for modern corporate politics and economics. Those who define humanity and selfhood in literature "seem at times to imitate the great modern consolidations of power, to follow the example of parties and states and their scientific and military instruments" in order to help destroy "a discredited and fallen individualism."3 Herzog is surely a man who both feels discredited and expresses discredit; he might be put on the long list of fictional characters who descend from Dostoevsky's Underground Man and who exhibit the moral inversions of the literature of the anti-Self. But like Dostoevsky's famous character, Herzog has a brilliant understanding of his own basis for self-contempt. Perversity, he thinks, will have no limit in a world where the individual self is barred from conscience and responsibility. Men need the chance to exercise a personal virtue but they live in a world where the historical process and social technology have come to monopolize virtue. This gives individuals nothing to do for each other, Herzog exclaims. Crumbs of decency - all that we paupers can spare one another. No wonder "personal" life is a humiliation, and to be an individual contemptible. The historical process, putting clothes on our backs, shoes on the feet, meat in the mouth, does infinitely more for us by the indifferent method than anyone does by intention .... And since these good commodities are the gifts of anonymous planning and labor, what intentional goodness can achieve (when the good are amateurs) becomes the question In a world where the good are "amateurs," or possibly philistines, the artistry of the personal life may come to rest in the opposite of being good. This is the conclusion that Herzog draws. When "it is 'good' to electrify a primitive area" and when "we obey Jesus in shipping machinery to Peru or Sumatra, what is there left for personal virtue? Can virtue compete?" Rather the alternative is welcome. "Intelligent oberservers have pointed out that 'spiritual' honor or respect formerly reserved for justice, courage, temperance, mercy, may now be earned in the negative by the grotesque." The grotesque may be clownish or it may be criminal, like Sartre's St. 3. Saul Bellow, "Some Notes on Recent American Fiction," Encounter, Vol. XXI, No. 22 (November, 1963), p. 29.</page><page sequence="14">The Second Fall of Man 79 Genet; Herzog himself fumbles with a gun and for a while is close to translating self-hatred, or the moral negative, into a general principle of human relationships. But more than his ineptitude saves him. As he senses himself, the need for spiritual honor and self-respect is reflected in his behavior, and this can help formulate an answer to the question he has asked, the question of what is human. Like Henderson, he begins to understand that the primary human theme is "I want." Perversity itself suggests that "I want" is not a phrase for the simple actuality of appetites. "Wants" are expressed by the imagination, monster making as well as God making, and always they run against the grain of nature and the given truth. It is in this sense that humanity is transcendental, whether "upward" or "downward." But honor prohibits lying, as Herzog says sardonically to Luke Asphalter, meekest of existentialists. The world .... warns you to stay away from consolation if you value your intellectual honor. On this theory truth is punishment, and you must take it like a man. It says truth will harrow your soul because your inclination as a poor human thing is to lie and to live by lies. Under this provision there is no truth higher than that of the animate creatures who cannot lie about themselves. But strange result, the 'truth' which imitates nature has a way of turning itself into a grosser lie, as when Henderson makes himself into pig and lion, and as Thea would force Augie into being more eagle than the eagle itself. False originality, false authenticity are everywhere in the world which Sammler sees with his marvelous one eye. The America of the Sixties which he observes is a circus, a Hollywood set, in which everyone pretends to be playing in his own "cinema verit¬ø." Just look .... at this imitative anarchy of the streets - these Chinese revolutionary tunics, these babes in unisex toyland, these surrealist warchief s, Western stagecoach drivers . . . They sought originality. They were obviously derivative. And of what - Paiutes, of Fidel Castro? No, of Hollywood extras. Acting mythic. Casting themselves into chaos, hoping to adhere to higher consciousness, to be washed up on the shores of truth. Better, thought Sammler, to accept the inevitability of imitation and then to imitate good things. The ancients had this right. Greatness without models? Inconceivable. One could not be the thing itself - Reality. One must be satisfied with the symbols. Make it the object of imitation to reach and release the higher qualities. Make peace therefore with intermediacy and representation. But choose higher representations. Otherwise the individual must be the failure he now sees and knows himself to be.</page><page sequence="15">80 HAROLD KAPLAN If nature is your sanction, and truth your God, they will still provide your ideals. You will imitate them transcendentally. You cannot be anything coherently without first wanting to be it and that is the distinctive note of the human. Roar like a lion, scream like an eagle, overmatch the bull with a bull-like courage, but what will remain evidentially human is a large size metaphysical fantasy. It is therefore possible to say, and this is the heart of the matter, that in the universe of Bellow's fiction, the assertion "I want" has dominance over the primary "I am." It is also possible to say that here he diverges from the mainstream of modern fiction, which has shown itself willing to treat all human civilization as a superfluity which conceals the indispensable and authentic "I am." But this leads to a confusion or contradiction with depressing results. The ontological statement is found inevitably to mask the normative will, or generate the latter from itself, so that every assertion of reductive truth becomes almost immediately a sanction and a promise for behavior. Thea Fenchel for instance longs for the immanent being and mighty poise of animal creatures, but she does nothing but wrestle with Augie March's human limitations. She would bed with snakes and eagles, it seems, but her lover is human in a different sense. The comedy goes further. Bellow is not too kind to her as he describes her disappointment in discovering that her eagle Caligula is not a fierce creature after all but rather human in his dislike of pain, and in fact he is something of a coward, with no murder in his heart. Augie defends him. "Why, if you're hurt, what do you expect?" But that was my humanizing again, and she shook her head. She believed fierce nature shouldn't be like that. It is the great disappointment in her life, that nature should betray her expectations. Her face burned. At his fraud, that he should look such a cruel machine, so piercing, such a chief, and have another spirit under it all. Well, it was hard to take this from wild nature, that there should be humanity mixed with it; such as there was in the beasts that embraced Odysseus and his men and wept on them in Circe's yard. Here Bellow imposes an amusing reversal on modern style primitivism in his work. He humanizes his animals rather than animalizing his human characters and the unheroic climax for this sort ofthing occurs when he describes Henderson and a circus bear trapped with each other on a roller coaster; equally terrorized they fall into each other's arms, the bear enhumaned and Henderson embeared.</page><page sequence="16">The Second Fall Of Man 8 1 Thea accuses Augie of getting human affections mixed up with everything, but the joke against her tells us that this is as it should be. The capacity of Bellow's writing to give deep relief to a moral hunger is based on this consenting anthropomorphism. It can be considered that the will to purge all traces of anthropomorphism from modern art and thought is dangerously related to human self-hatred and perhaps an inclination to purge the world of humanity. But the opposite result is almost as forbidding. When nature is used as a text with which to preach to man, there is still the possibility that it communicates a useful standard, whether it be an animal grace under stress, or courage, or vital joy in experience. And in fact the religious spirit has entered the naturalism we know best in fiction and common life. Henry Adams illustrated this in his Education', it is never enough to recognize an ultimate power in nature, as he did in observing the electric dynamos at the Paris World Fair of 1900. One wants to fall on one's knees and worship it. In this sense Mr. Sammler's Planet is a conclusive work in the development of Bellow's critique of the naturalist ethos. The central metaphor in Sammler is an outsize primitive phallus displayed by the black pickpocket as a means of seriously impressing Mr. Sammler with what the latter calls the Negro's "metaphysical warrant." The purpose is more than continuing his trade as a thief and silencing Sammler for the police. It is meant to reverse moral authority, it is a display of triumphant right which cancels all traces of the illicit and the furtive in the Negro's criminal life. .... there was the man's organ, a huge piece of sex flesh, half- tumescent in its pride and shown in its own right, a prominent and separate object intended to communicate authority. As, within the sex ideology of these days, it well might. It was a symbol of superlegitimacy or sovereignty. It was a mystery. It was unanswerable. The whole explanation. This is the wherefore, the why. See? Oh, the transcending, ultimate, and silencing proof . . . Sammler understands the implications of this revelation. .... make Nature your god, elevate creatureliness, and you can count on gross results. The poignance of the novel rests on the old man's lonely arguments with the pride and authority of the flesh. He is an exile in the New York of the Sixties, a wounded relic of the holocaust of burnt flesh which took place twenty five years before in Europe. Who has more right to say what he has to say? The phallus tells him that it is super-legitimacy and authority that men seek in nature, not joy, or expressibility, or freedom. In other</page><page sequence="17">82 HAROLD KAPLAN words instinctual license is never just license in human affairs. It is mystery, it is power, it is sovereignty. What then was the metaphysical warrant for the slaughter of millions? Was it any less mysterious, more negotiable than the black man's penis? The Negro himself remains silent, even when he finally falls under violence at the end of the novel. Sovereignty at this level has no more to say than death. Sammler thinks of the German philosophers of power, which they called Will, those who in the 19th century spoke in the annunciation of the new god of cosmic force acting through nature and controlling human events. The question they opened up remains alive. Are we at war with this god, or do we follow and fulfill its commands? From Schopenhauer, Sammler says, I learned that only Ideas are not over-powered by the Will- the cosmic force, the Will, which drives all things. A blinding power. The inner creative fury of the world. And according to Schopenhauer, "the organs of sex are the seat of the Will." The thief in the lobby agreed. He took out the instrument of the Will. He ... showed Sammler his metaphysical warrant. This is Sammler's (and Bellow's) vision of a modern crisis. The tigerish and princely black thief rules the street and may have begun to rule men's minds. Shula, Sammler's daughter, half mad as she is from her own experience in the German carnage, steals a manuscript from the Indian savant in order to help her father, so that the warrant of power would aggrandize on his side for a change. In her random nonsensical crime, Shula wants to share in the "inner creative fury of the world." Then suddenly she too was like the Negro pickpocket. From the black side, strong currents were sweeping over everyone. Child, black, redskin - the unspoiled Seminoie against the horrible Whiteman. Millions of civilized people wanted oceanic, boundless, primitive, neckfree nobility, experienced a strange release of galloping impulses, and acquired the peculiar aim of sexual niggerhood for everyone, (p. 149) The passage stings and what are we to make of its prejudices? The black as the champion of primitivism, liberation as "sexual niggerhood for everyone?" I don't think Bellow was denounced for a passage like this in any of the conventional reviewing organs but his underground reputation as a "reactionary" has no doubt grown. And it is true that what is sometimes called the cultural revolution of the Sixties was in fact the stimulus for the controlled anger which gives Mr Sammler's Planet more coherence and fine edge than either Herzog or Augie March. One</page><page sequence="18">The Second Fall of Man 83 could point out of course that Sammler is a character and not the author, a special case, a long suffering old man free to color his ideas with specific revulsions from people and events. And is Bellow to be confused with Herzog, who often sounds like a crank in the back of the room interrupting a distinguished colloquium consisting of Spinoza, Nietzsche, Heidegger, etc.? Yet it is true that when we trace Bellow's own voice, the sound merges into the bitter contention of our times. It is no light quarrel and whether or not in the long run his work will appear marred by it, right now we can say that the tone as well as the substance reflect his moral seriousness. This much we capture from Bellow, that he is witness to our most grievous experiences and disturbing anxieties. It is not that he reports injury and catastrophe; for that there are plenty of documents in the form of novels. Rather he touches matters of faith and belief; like Dostoevsky and perhaps T. S. Eliot, he imagines the consequences of ideas and relates action to the temperament of faith. That, and the ambience of mental struggle, give his work moral vigor, in contrast to the fatal sentimentality and abstraction which are the effects of the more typical moral determinism in modern writing. As for Mr. Sammler and his struggle, there is no question that he makes a defensible proposition when he says that a strong current of primitivism sweeps through modern cultural dissent. It is nature that defends men in their war with repressive culture, no matter what the specific forms of repression might be, racial, economic, or sexist. It is an anomaly beset by contradictions that contemporary moral outrage should have its sanction or "warrant" in naturalist impulse, and it requires the convolutions in the thinking of Herbert Marcuse or Norman Brown to explain how this is so. Bizarre it is but quite probable that naturalist doctrine should speak in the tones of a bigoted certainty not matched since the Puritans. A close look at modern revolutionary politics since Marx will reveal the role of historic and naturalist determinism in supporting faith. Sammler, on the other hand, is not defending privilege and an established power. He has known "liberation" in all its ranges and to the degree of mass murder; he has known a hostility to culture without limit, guided by the sanction of "race," that is, nature, and this is the context for his dour reactions to the "counter-culture" and the phallic ruler of the streets. The important specific is not his dislike for oppressed minorities but his rejection of a naturalist egalitarianism. The point I suppose is that he finds no justice and no right in naturalism and no liberation in it either. If he feels the appalling force of sexuality this must be understood in the context of his own experience with instinctual and reflexive violence, as</page><page sequence="19">84 HAROLD KAPLAN he remembers his naked struggle to survive in the forests of Poland, his equally naked urge to kill the stray German soldier he meets there. He has a strong prejudice but it is a prejudice against the pride of bare flesh and deep instinct. The pickpocket's phallus, stark image at the center of Sammler's old age in New York, must be contrasted with the Nazi holocaust of his youth. It is for the reader to make the connection between the random violence and sexual license of New York in the Sixties and the world catastrophe of the Forties, or the closer comparison with the disoriented and permissive Weimar era which brought in fascism. Sammler in any case is fascinated for deeper reasons than the historic parallels, if they exist. It is violence itself which compels him, whatever the general social context for it. His strongest pictorial memory isthat of his last moments with his wife, as they dig their common grave with several hundred others. They stand "naked as children from the womb," and wait for the final blast of fire from the guns, and the sound of the earth falling. For Sammler this war experience represents a ritual event in the metaphysics of power, the violence cult of modern politics. The supreme aura of belief in himself which leads the black pickpocket to exhibit his penis to arouse respect, also rises from a general ambience of modern history, which happens to be the history of war and violent politics. Sammler ruminates over this and reflects that modern revloutions had aimed for a kind of equality but not that of "friends and brothers". It is rather the equality of power, where men in the mass assumed the privileges and impunities of tyrants, charged with the power to do violence. So revolutions plunged into blood - There came Napoleon, a gangster who washed Europe well in blood. There came Stalin, for whom the really great prize of power was unobstructed enjoyment of murder. That mighty enjoyment of consuming the breath of men's nostrils, swallowing their faces like a Saturn. This was what the conquest of power really seemed to mean. But it is the general welcome to this dark cult that impresses Sammler, more than the existence of the "gangsters" and "murderers". And for the middle part of society there was envy and worship of this power to kill. How those middle-class Sorels and Maurrases adored it- the hand|thatgripped the knife with authority. How they loved the man strong enough to take blood guilt on himself. Sammler seems to understand how belief unites men, not instinct or mere creaturely existence. Moral transcendence has always had some relation to the courage to face death, to dispute its authority with a</page><page sequence="20">The Second Fall of Man 85 grand act of choice. But this usually was a choice that moved to another realm, both moral and supernatural, away from death into the arms of God, for instance. Naturalistic transcendence is a paradoxical phenomenon, since it has only the terms of nature in which to manifest itself. It is probable that the ambition to become a martyr can be transferred under naturalism to the will to do murder, that is, to have power over death through a surrogate. One thereby can appreciate or know transcendence, a logic that Dostoevsky's Kirillov, in The Possessed, turned to his own suicide, which had the sole point of proving that man could have transcendence without God. Something like this is implied in Sammler's own brooding reflections on violence and the elites who define themselves in its terms. For them an elite must prove itself in this ability to murder. For such people a saint must be understood as one who was equal in spirit to the fiery twisting of crime in the inmost fibers of his heart. The superman testing himself with an ax, crushing the skulls of old women. The Knight of Faith, capable of cutting the throat of his Isaac upon God's altar. And now the idea that one could recover, or establish, one's identity by killing, becoming equal thus to any, equal to the greatest. A man among men knows how to murder. A patrician. The middle class had formed no independent standards of honor. Thus it has no resistance to the glamour of killers. This passage is almost too blunt to be credible. Is this what Sammler took from his experience? Were the German soldiers an elite who were taught to prove themselves in murder, did they establish an identity by killing? He is perhaps reckless in his conclusions, but we understand Sammler nonetheless. His speculation on the "glamour of killers" is plucked out of the air, a topic of our times reproduced in multiple ways by movie directors and reviewers, by "existential" novelists and intellectual revolutionaries, by FBI men and poets. Death and violence rise steadily in their importance, in an illogical sort of way, as though modern naturalist obsessions would make dying the rival metaphysical experience of the body, as imperatively instructive as sex. I myself find it impossible not to imagine that Sammler was thinking more of Norman Mailer than Heinrich Himmler when he expressed himself this way. The extent, in fact, to which Bellow has been writing a subtle dialogue that could be applied to Mailer is a question worth pursuing. An American Dream, for instance, could illustrate in specific terms what Sammler says of the craving for violence and death in the modern consciousness, the need to expose oneself to it, to impose it on others, to survive in either case with an accretion of value to oneself.</page><page sequence="21">86 HAROLD KAPLAN The general point is supported in a sense by the fact that Bellow makes Sammler himself carry a kind of honor from his exposure to death in the holocaust. At least Gr√ºner, his nephew and friend, now dying himself, thinks so and believes that Sammler can give him mysterious comfort. He must have believed that he (Sammler) had some unusual power, magical perhaps, to affirm the human bond. What had he done to generate this belief? How had he induced it? By coming back from the dead, probably By having been given the shovel and told to dig. By digging beside his digging wife. When she faltered he tried to help her. By this digging, not speaking, he tried to convey something to her and fortify her .... The hole deepened, the sand clay and stones of Poland, their birthplace, opened up Death in Bellow's novel, as well as so many others including Mailer's, is a question that asks what can be affirmed. Is it the pointless ecstasy of survivors, is it the quite mad authority and dignity of killers, or is it something for both the dying and living, a sense of the human bond? There is no problem of choice for Gr√ºner, or Sammler, nor Sammler's wife, to whom Sammler hoped to convey something without speaking. It is enormously difficult to speak, as it turns out again with Gr√ºner, and perhaps speech isn't necessary. But there is an absence more eloquent than speech in these closing pages of the novel, the absence of Gruner's son Wallace, who is off on his aimless ventures, buzzing the housetops of Long Island, flirting one might say with petty forms of the apocalypse, like the flooding of his father's house in his search for hidden treasure. A greater distance separates Gr√ºner from his daughter, Angela, who waits resentfully at the hospital, considering her father's grievance against her. Sammler's last service to his friend is to speak for him to his daughter. He is struggling with her to make some sign of recognition, to meet her own "assignment" in the world, as he calls it in the closing moments of her father's life. "He's done well and I admire him," [he says to the daughter] .... Your father has had his assignments, .... We have our assignments .... That's what's in his good face. That's why he has such a human look." Sammler reads out these assignments, knowing they cannot sound impressive. "Husband, medical man - he was a good doctor - family man, success. American, wealthy retirement with a Rolls Royce Feeling outgoingness, expressiveness, kindness, hear all these fine human things which by a peculiar turn of opinion strike people now as shady activities."</page><page sequence="22">The Second Fall of Man 87 Sammler knows why Gruner's kindness and outgoingness have no chance with his daughter and his son. Their ethical nihilism is also their ethical puritanism - they know, as Sammler knows, that Gr√ºner was deeply involved with the Mafia in his medical practice, that he was indeed capable of shady dealings, and had accumulated the tax exempt treasure which Wallace has hunted so desperately. This rigor of judgment is embraced by their own slackness of behavior. It is a legend of our times. The fact that her father is human cannot impress Angela; she had her own amoral adventures which have more glamour to her than her father's furtive and concealed pecadillos in making money. "So he's human. All right, he's human," Angela says, sitting with her legs apart, the pink material of her underwear visible under her microskirt. It is with this that he says to himself, "Why argue? What is the point?' What is the oppressive evidence of futility in this? Why should Sammler feel that her private parts speak for her? But as he persists, he explains. "Well, everybody's human only in some degree. Some more than others." "Some very littler "That's the way it seems. Very little. Faulty. Scanty. Dangerous." "I thought everybody was born human?" "It's not a natural gift at all. Only the capacity is natural." The distinction between nature and what is human points backward through the novel and to the rest of Bellow's work. Still Angela has a right to demand how one manifests the capacity and becomes human. It may be that Bellow's invention fails him, but I think not. Sammler would seem to be at a loss. "You've got to do something for him. He has a need." "What something am I supposed to do?" "That's up to you. If you love him, you can make some sign." (p. 279) Angela reacts with the pride of her sophistication and a style of the unsentimental as callous as her brother's stunt flying. ". . . if there is anything at all in what you say, you want an old- time deathbed scene .... I should ask him to forgive me? Are you serious?" "I am perfectly serious." "But how could I - It goes against everything. You're talking to the wrong person. Even for my father it would be too hokey. I can't see it." At this point Sammler directs against her a powerful, even a dreadful</page><page sequence="23">88 HAROLD KAPLAN reproach, for which he knows she will never forgive him. Angela, Sammler points out, who considers a goodby scene with her father as going against everything in her grain, was able to have sexual intercourse with strangers. Diversions, group intercourse, fellatio with strangers - one can do that but not come to terms with one's father at the last opportunity. The statement is blunt, even cruel. The sex adventure in Mexico to which this refers, and which caused both her break with her fiancee and the estrangement with her father, is only a symbol, like the penis of the black thief. But it is a powerful one, a curious atavism of instinct which has accompanied the degeneracy of emotional and moral relationships, our "assignments" as Sammler has called them. The sentimentality of the sex organs is triumphant - but the sentiment of the heart, of kindness, of good feeling, this remains suspect and forbidden. How strong a conjunction it is, fellatio with strangers and silence for her dying father. In the face of it we can only say that Bellow has focussed his rage. And yet a kind of intellectual diffidence, even an insecurity is reflected in all of Bellow's novels at their moments of conclusion. Sammler is not most eloquent now, at a time when many readers would insist on enlightenment. He is almost as surprised as Angela to find himself speaking; verisimilitude condemns such scenes to awkwardness, and it seems gratuitous to ask for ultimate wisdom in the hospital corridor. But the sound of lame piety does express what he has to say. He does not mention filial love or natural love as an authority to rival the anarchical sex god, although he talks of kindness and general good feeling for others. He prefers, however, words like assignment, bond, and contract to express the alternative to the blind authority of the black man's penis and Angela's own throbbing sex. Being human, we remember, is not a natural gift, but a commitment and requires an effort. It seems that Bellow recognizes that our moral situation is too dark and confused to be dealt with by spontaneous emotions and generous feeling. The children of Israel had their prophets to admonish them of their duty when they went astray. Men speak to each other this way with reason. They live by an acknowledged bond that is stronger and more precious even than a heart filled with love. There is this in religious ritual and it may be deeper than moral eloquence. In summing up at the end of the novel before his friend Gruner's body, Sammler speaks the preliminary words of the Jewish Yiskar service for the dead. "Remember, God, the soul of Elya Gr√ºner, who, as willingly as possible and as well as he was able, and even to an intolerable point,</page><page sequence="24">The Second Fall of Man 89 and even in suffocation and even as death was coming was eager, even childishly perhaps (may I be forgiven for this), even with a certain servility, to do what was required of him. At his best this man was much kinder than at my very best I have ever been or could ever be. He was aware that he must meet, and he did meet - through all the confusion and degraded clowning of this life through which we are speeding - he did meet the terms of his contract. The terms which, in his inmost heart, each man knows. As I know mine. As all know. For that is the truth of it - that we all know. God, that we know, that we know, we know, we know." "That we know" is Bellow's answer to generations dealing in moral obscurantism. But like any literary text it is not an ethical argument. If we don't know what Sammler knows, or Gr√ºner knows, no effort from critic or author will help the failure to read closely. There is in the text, as alive as Angela's redolent thighs or her father's bandaged neck, the sensibly achieved appreciation of the human bond. It speaks as clearly as the flesh and for this Bellow's writing is rare, and like Herzog's mad ideas but more solidly, may have "historic importance."</page></plain_text>
