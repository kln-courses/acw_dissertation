See "Instructions for Elec tronic Submission," http:/Iaom.pace.edu/amjlelec tronic.html. Please use Times Roman 12-point type and the 8V2 X 11 page setting; place page numbers in the upper right corner; and leave top and side margins of at least one inch. Publication Accepted papers are copy-edited and retyped. Authors review edits and proofread their work. AMJ's copy editor-production manager will con tact you after the editor assigns your work to an issue. Expect some time lag between acceptance and this contact. If your work is accepted, please keep the editor (amj-srynes@uiowa.edu) and the copy editor (pdoliner@twcny.rr.com) informed of changes in your contact information and long absences. Front Pages Address. Under the title of your work, list au thors' names, affiliations, and complete addresses. Example: AN EXCELLENT STUDY A. A. MANAGEMENT SCHOLAR Current University School and/or Department Building and/or Street City, State, Zip Code Tel: (000) 000-0000 Fax: (000) 000-0000 e-mail: scholar@univ.edu Acknowledgment. If you wish to acknowledge financial support or other assistance, add a note at the bottom of page 1, your title page. Abstract. An abstract of no more than 100 words and the title of the work go on page 2. Back Pages Group references and any appendixes, tables, and figures at the end of your manuscript. Continue your page numbering. Headings and Sections AMJ uses only three levels of headings. Use bold face for all three. Main headings (all capital letters; centered) are first. Second-level headings (title-style letters; flush left) are next. Third-level headings (first letter of first word capitalized; indented; italicized; and run into paragraph) are next. Don't skip steps: no second-level headings before you use a first-level heading, for instance. Use sec ond- and third-level headings in sets of two or more. Examples: METHODS [1st level] Data and Sample [2nd level] Measures [2nd level] Independent variable. [3rd level] Dependent variables. [3rd level] Footnotes Use footnotes, not endnotes. Hypotheses Fully and separately state each hypothesis you tested separately. Give it a distinct number (Hy pothesis 1) or number-letter (Hypothesis la) label. Set hypotheses off in indented blocks, in italic type. Examples: Hypothesis la. Concise writing has a positive relation ship to publication. Hypothesis lb. Following AMJ's "Style Guide for Au thors" has a positive relationship to publication. Language Technical terms. Help your work to be accessible to AMJ's wide-ranging readership. Define key techni cal terms. A technical term is a word or phrase that is not in a general-use dictionary with the meaning you (or even you and other published scholars) ascribe to 407</page><page sequence="2">408 Academy of Management Journal April it. Put quotation marks around the first appearance in your paper of each technical term, or define it. Abbreviations. Avoid using them for the names of concepts. Use ordinary words for variable names?not code names or other abbreviations. Use the same name for a variable throughout your text, tables, figures, and appendixes. Names of organizations and research instruments may be abbreviated, but give the full name the first time you mention one of these. Names of software and some databases may be abbreviated. Reporting math. Do not "talk in math" in regular text. Use words. For instance, "We surveyed 100 employees," not "We surveyed n = 100 employees" and "We used a chi-square test to evaluate fit," not "We used a y2 test." Do use symbols and numbers to report results and give formulas. Italicize letters that are custom arily italicized [p, r, b, F, Z, and so forth). Use boldface italic for vectors. Put spaces around equals signs, minus signs, etc. Illustrative results within text go in parentheses. Introduce them with complete sentences. Example: One coefficient for the interaction was significant (model 3: ? = 0.06, p &lt; .05; model 5: ? = 1.06). Keep equations in your running text unless they contain oversized symbols or division, and/or are very important in your research. Examples: Run-in equation?We used Craig's (1992: 20) distance formula (d - xyz). Displayed equation? [e~x(xt)\(Xty] Pv(Yt = ytxt) =-YtT~* (1) where Yt is. . . . Define each new term in all equations. Sexist or biased language. Avoid language that might be interpreted as denigrating. Do not use "he" or "she" exclusively. Using the plural? changing "the manager . . . he" to "managers . . . they"?is one solution; using "he or she" ("him or her") is another. Active voice and first person. Write in the active voice ("They did it") instead of the passive voice ("It was done") to make it easy for readers to see who did what. Use the first person ("I" or "we") to describe what you, or you and your coauthors, did. Examples: Passive (less desirable)?Two items were found to lack factor validity by Earley (1989). Active (more desirable)?Earley (1989) found that two items lacked factor validity. Third person (less desirable)?The author developed three new items. First person (more desirable)?I developed three new items. Anthropomorphism. Do not describe inanimate entities (models, theories, firms, and so forth) as acting in ways only humans can act. Appendixes Present long but essential methodological de tails, such as the calculation of measures, in an appendix or appendixes. Be concise. Avoid exact reproductions of surveys. Label appendixes "APPENDIX A," "APPENDIX B," and so forth. A substantive title, such as "Items in Scales," should follow. Label tables within ap pendixes "Table Al," "Bl," and so forth. Tables and Figures Look at tables and figures in published issues of AM] to see preferred formats. For each table or figure, center "TABLE" or "FIG URE" with a number ("1," "2," etc.) at the top of the page. Put the title under this, also centered and boldface, but in upper- and lower-case letters. Number tables and figures consecutively (one se ries for tables, one for figures). Place them at the end of your manuscript, but indicate the position of each in the text as follows: Insert Table 2 about here Each table or figure needs an introductory sentence in your text. More on tables. Use more than one page if needed. Do not squeeze material onto one page by shrinking type. Don't use code names and abbrevi ations. Example: Desirable variable name?Profitability Undesirable variable name?PRFT Each table should report one type of analysis (which is identified in the title), and each vertical column and horizontal row should contain only one type of data. Report only two decimal places for all statistics. Place correlation coefficients in the lower-left cor ners of their tables.</page><page sequence="3">2006 Style Guide for Authors 409 Use superscript small letters to designate table footnotes. A lettered footnote may be used to sum marize significance levels: a All values greater than . . . are significant at. . . . Or report significance levels in separate footnotes placed in a stack under your regular table footnotes. Example: tp &lt; .10 *p &lt; .05 **p &lt; .01 More on figures. Figures, unlike tables, have graphics. Make sure your figures will print out clearly so that they can be scanned. Do not use color. Use the same full variable names you use in your text and tables. Citations These are your in-text, in parentheses, identifi cations of other research. Every work that has a citation needs to have a corresponding reference (see "References," below). Examples: Name and year?Several studies (Adams, 1994; Bern stein, 1988, 1992; Celias, 2000a, 2000b) support this conclusion. Year only?But Van Dorn and Xavier (2001) presented conflicting evidence. Order. Order citations alphabetically. Designate two or more works by one author (or by an identical group of authors) published in the same year by adding "a," "b," and so forth, after the year. See the "name and year" example above. Multiple authors. If a work has two authors, give both names every time you cite it. For three through six authors, give all names the first time, then use "et al." in citations. Examples: First citation? (Foster, Whittington, Tucker, Homer, Hubbard, &amp; Grimm, 2000). Subsequent citation?(Foster et al., 2000). For seven or more authors, use "et al." even for the first citation. (But the corresponding reference should give all the names.) Page numbers in citations. Use this format: Writing a book is "a long and arduous task" (Lee, 1998: 3). Citation with no author. For an article with no author, cite the periodical as author. Example: Periodical as author?Analysts predicted an increase in service jobs [Wall Street Journal, 1999). For reports, handbooks, and the like, cite the "cor porate author" that produced them. Example: Organization as author?Analysts predict an increase in service jobs in the U.S. Industrial Outlook (U.S. Depart ment of Commerce, 1992). Such sources can also be identified informally. No corresponding reference will then be needed. Example: Informal citation?According to the 1999 U.S. Industrial Outlook, published by the U.S. Department of Com merce, service jobs will increase. Electronic sources. Use a regular citation (author, year) if you can identify an author of one of the types discussed above (human, periodical, or cor porate). If not, give the Web address that was your source in parentheses. No corresponding reference need be used in the latter case. References References are your entries in the alphabetical list at the end of your article or research note. This list should include only work you have cited. Order. Alphabetize references by the last name of a sole author, a first author, or an editor, or by the name of a corporate author (for instance, U.S. Cen sus Bureau) or periodical (such as the Wall Street Journal) if there is no human author or editor. Or der works by an identical author by year of publi cation, listing the earliest first. If the years of pub lication are also the same, differentiate entries by adding small letters ("a," "b," etc.) after the years. Repeat the author's name for each entry. Books. Follow this form: Last names, initials (separated by a space). Year. Title (Boldface italic, capitalize only the first letter of the first word and of the first word after a long dash or colon.) City where published: Name of publisher. (For small U.S. and Canadian cities, follow the name of the city with the postal abbreviation for the state or province; for small cities in other countries, give the full name of the country.)

The Forum has a threefold call: (1) to unite the strengths of business with the universally recognized values of the UN Global Compact and the world's Millennium Development Goals, which includes the eradication of extreme poverty, restoring the environment and building partnerships for peace and development; (2) to directly challenge "the great tradeoff illusion" and to explore fresh research on the business case for sustainable development as essential to contemporary corporate strategy and societal well-being; and (3) to re-envision management education as a major world player in transformational learning?to envision management education extending its immense influence to advance global corporate citizenship by transforming the intellectual frameworks and attitudes, and thus the contributions, of millions of future leaders. Call for Papers and Workshops - Due May 1, 2006. We invite research papers, essays, integrative research reviews, conceptual frameworks and defining case studies from all management disciplines on the Forum themes. Papers may be empirical, conceptual or narrative-based. Innovative workshops on the strategic aspects of sustainable value creation, including management methods for advancing business as an agent of world benefit, are also invited. Especially welcomed are real-life profiles of CEOs, managers, companies and public-private partnerships that have dared to view social and global challenges not as burdens but as business opportunities, new sources of innovation and the basis for long-term fiscal success. We invite submissions from professors, students, executives, managers and civic leaders. A peer-review process will select submissions for presentation at the Forum, with outstanding papers considered for a state-of-the-art book as well as for a special journal issue.

Jeffrey Pfeffer on the State of Public Management Research Roderick Kramer on Social Capital and a Symposium on The Control of Legal and Illegal Networks The International Public Management Journal (IPMJ) publishes high-quality empirical and theoretical work on managing large organizations, particularly public organizations. IPMJ features work from scholars around the world who conduct research in the areas of public management and government reform, comparative public administration, organizational theory, and organizational behavior. IPMJ seeks to provide a bridge between those conducting research on public management and public administration on the one hand, and those working in the areas of organizational behavior and organizational theory on the other. Beginning in 2006, the International Public Management Journalwill be published by Routledge and will increase publication to 4 issues per year. We have recently dramatically expanded the presence of distinguished organizational behavior and organization theory scholars on our editorial board. This reflects their commitment to a rebirth of public-sector research in mainstream organization studies. We have also established the Accenture Advances in Public Management Award for our best article. For more about IPMJ and the International Public Management Network, visit www.inpuma.net.
