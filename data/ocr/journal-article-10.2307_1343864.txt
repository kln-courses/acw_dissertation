For Smithson, Fried's account of minimalism had "set the critical stage for manneristic modernism," providing as it did a "ready-made parody of the war between Renaissance classicism (modernity) versus Manneristic anti-classicism (theater)."2 This caustic appraisal was more than just one of the Bowery boys taking a potshot at the crumbling hegemony of Amer- ican modernism." Smithson felt the "syntax of his delivery" made Fried a "more interesting adversary" than many of the critics coming to terms with the contemporary art of the 1960s.4 Indeed the image of freedom that Fried so cogently defended in "Art and Objecthood" presented a compelling challenge to Smithson's artistic preference for what I call an aesthetics of confinement. A quarter century later, from the perspective of the now-ongoing postmodernist debates, Smithson's short 1967 text takes on the character- istics of what Freud calls the uncanny-something odd, yet very familiar. This letter, as if a force from the past, mirrors the more recent decade of Derridian deconstructive discourse; here I refer specifically to the semio- logical readings that the Octoberist camp has performed on Smithson's art.5 Although apt, the word mirrors may be somewhat misleading in de- portion of an interview with Bruce Kurtz, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institu- tion, microfilm reel 3834, frame no. 1224; collection hereafter abbreviated AAA. "American Sculpture" was published in conjunction with the American Sculpture of the Sixties show at Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). This show marked the midpoint in mini- malism's meteoric rise within the international museum network. Artforum was published at the time in Los Angeles, but relied on New York critics, predominantly formalist in value, including Michael Fried, Barbara Rose, Rosalind Krauss, and William Rubin who, in 1967, had also become curator at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA). 2.

Although the content of Smithson's letter to the editor reappears in the very impulse of the Octo- berists' more recent assessments of Fried's aesthetics, it first appeared within a modernist convention that the Octoberists refused to recognize in their readings of Smithson's art. The uncanniness that reverberated throughout this relationship, and the response it provoked in this art historian, composes the substance of this essay. Although I agree with the Octoberists' contention that what is com- municated through significant art is conventionality-"the horizon within which all knowledge is contained, the limit that circumscribed what it was possible to say, to depict, even to think"-6the Octoberists have nonetheless refused to take their own discourse seriously enough. Using the art by Smithson as an analog to their own poststructuralist critique of representation-"especially as it was conceived by modern- ism"-7they have consistently repressed from their discourse how Smith- son's art found its success within the conventional aesthetics of the picturesque. This repression has also, in effect, made more opaque the Octoberists' anamorphic view of postmodernism. My analysis of the current status of the postmodern/Smithson con- nection will reconsider the theoretical parameters that structured Smith- son's artistic practice. This pursuit will relocate the success of Smithson's art within a continuum by reattaching it and its public success to the aes- thetic category of the picturesque-sublime. With Fried's continued suc- cess, Smithson's letter to the editor-which charged Fried's aesthetics with trying to resist the reality of the 1960s with an ontology that was no longer adequate to the task-seems the appropriate, albeit arbitrary, vanishing point in that perspective.8 Yet, by using ingredients from the category of the picturesque-sublime, this essay will attempt to reposition Smithson's work while redifferentiating the Octoberist / Smithson rela- tionship. I will also suggest how the significant aesthetic discourse (or anti-aesthetic discourse) of the Octoberists is no less autonomous of or 1984). The latter was the first in a continuing series of anthologies distributed by the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York. 6.

Despite Smithson's prominent position in today's postmodernism, his attack on Fried has not minimized Fried's own recovery in that very same postmodern discourse. Art histo- rian Norman Bryson claims that his own art historical project of tracking the screen of recognition in art-one version of the "New Art Histories"-is maintenance work done on Michael Fried's triadic structure of object/ interference (theatrical screen) / observer.

The force of Michael Fried's account of minimalism in "Art and Ob- jecthood" worked on two fronts. His notions of absorption (the lack of dis- tance and thus difference between object and observer) and theatricality (the presence of an observer locatable in the artwork) have a long tradi- tion in the discipline of art history itself. For example, Wolfflin's distinc- tion between the painterly (in which the observer is unable to situate or establish a definite spatial organization and relationship with what is hap- pening in the canvas) and the linear (that which defines space within the canvas and, in the process, one's relationship to that image) represented a similar dichotomy.9 But "Art and Objecthood" was nonetheless intended for a different audience, the desires of which helped to formulate his notions of absorption and theatricality. For example, Fried's use of the notion of theater-defined as "what lies between the arts"("AO," p. 21)- referenced minimalist artist Donald Judd's conception of an art form be- tween painting and sculpture in his 1965 article "Specific Objects." 10 Fried also took on Robert Morris and his two-part article "Notes on Sculpture" (1966), which emphasized the context of the art object. Morris drew a distinction between a modernist aesthetic-in which "what is to be had from the work is located strictly within" it, as if the observer were not present-and his "newer aesthetic"-"'' in which the experience of a minimalist work is "of an object in a situation-one that, virtually by defi- nition, includes the beholder"("AO," p. 125). Nonetheless, Morris argued that the minimalist object lacked any anthropomorphic effect. To substantiate that claim, Morris structured his argument around the psy- chological notion of a gestalt: how the ego (read, an observer of art) un- consciously and immediately scans or contains various shapes; how a perceiving subject believes that the pattern within her or his mind corre- sponds to the available facts of the seen object. For example, a compli- cated, many-sided shape will be less easily grasped conceptually all at once than a primary structure. For Morris's notion of the gestalt to be effective, his art objects had to be argued as self-contained units. As Mor- ris stated it: "That the space of the room becomes of such importance 9.

Fried countered Morris's version of a gestalt by redefining it through his notion of "stage presence" (as opposed to presentness) and defined the effect of Morris's gestalt as that which "extorts from the beholder" his or her own anthropomorphic desires ("AO," p. 127). In Fried's account, because the object's gestalt occurs within a mental makeup of the ob- server, minimalist objects were anthropomorphic. This hidden-yet-active presence of the observer defined the "theatricality of objecthood" in the literalist object (Fried's term for minimalism) ("AO," p. 135). Fried did not deny the external circumstances through which the beholder encounters objects; in fact, he insisted on Morris's exterior circumstances (that is, exte- rior to the literal object). The complaint Fried registered against the mini- malists was not that they refused the dialectical notion of objecthood (its literalness and its theatricality) as immanent within the very structure of any art form but that the literalist object, in effect, heeled like a trained dog to the observer. Morris may have tried to ensure the immediate experience of a ge- stalt with his rhetoric of hollowness, but for that very reason Fried claimed that the literalist object was fundamentally subjective and anthro- pomorphic; it depended utterly on the beholder for meaning. Fried dis- played Morris's claim that being hollow the minimalist object was open to endless interpretations-a type of "inexhaustibility" in one's reading of literalist objects ("AO," p. 144). For Fried, the literalist object's forever bountiful potential for experience existed because the "beholder is made aware that 'he himself is establishing relationships as he apprehends the object'" ("AO," p. 144).'~ In counterpoint, Fried outlined how the signifi- cant art of the present was able to avoid (or at least downplay) this partic- ular role of the audience-and the object's subordination to it-with his notion of absorption. Through an art object's internal integrity, an imme- diacy of beholding-the phenomenological act of being held-defined the aesthetic experience that transcended the theatricality contaminating the modernist, literalist art object. Nonetheless, as Smithson pointed out, "What Fried fears most is the consciousness of what he is doing-namely being himself theatrical" ("L"). 12. Ibid., p. 233. 13. Fried is quoting Morris, "Notes on Sculpture," p. 233. I would term Fried's defini- tion for the literalist object's supposed inexhaustibility of meanings a kind of modernist writerly text-modernist in that the postmodernist definition of writerly text was not meant to give the observer the control of meaning once attributed to the artist (which Fried is doing here) but to locate how both the author and viewer's intentions are necessarily inscribed through societal conventions.</page><page sequence="6">424 Ron Graziani Smithson's Picturable Situation Consequently, with his 1967 account of minimalism Fried became for the Octoberists both Michael Fried the archaeologist, laying bare the very foundation of representation,14 and Michael Fried the castrated modern- ist bull.'5 In a 1986 debate with Fried and others, Octoberist Benjamin H. D. Buchloh asked in wonderment how Fried, in the mid-1960s, could have staged such a ridiculous claim for the immediacy of aesthetic per- ception. Fried responded that although American-type formalism in the 1960s was in decline, Clement Greenberg's theory did not seem discred- ited.'6 Fried felt that the modernist hegemony was profoundly threat- ened-a threat coming from both society and the art market. His defense of modernism was an attempt to forestall that assimilation. And like Greenberg, Fried's assessments of modernism were an attempt to devise an aesthetic language incapable of offering commodity satisfaction, that is, somehow resistant to the various forms of instrumentalization becom- ing more operative in the culture industry. Fried's reaction to what he called excessive theatricality in minimalist objects embodied that very desire. Since 1965, Fried has argued that "something like a dialectic of mod- ernism has in effect been at work in the visual arts for roughly a century [here referring to Hegel, Marx, and Lukacs] .... an ideal of action as radical criticism of itself founded upon as objective an understanding of one's present situation as one is able to achieve." 17 Fried translated this dialectical form of perpetual revolution into his aesthetics of modern art, providing "a principle by which painting can change, transform and re- new itself." The modern artist's action was "no longer gratuitous but im- posed"; he was no longer free to create but must confront the situation. For Fried, "after Marx, it is no longer possible for anyone to delude him- self that his attitudes toward art or society are a-political." 18 14. See Foster, "The Crux of Minimalism," in Individuals, ed. Howard Singerman (exhi- bition catalogue, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, 10 Dec. 1986-10 Jan. 1988), pp. 162-83. Here, a soon-to-be-Octoberist argues that Fried's account in "Art and Ob- jecthood" ironically foretold of the shift from a reflection "on the perceptual conditions of art" to a "more practical critique of the institution of art" (p. 176). 15. See Krauss's contribution to "Theories of Art after Minimalism and Pop," in Discus- sions in Contemporary Culture: Number 1, ed. Foster (Seattle, 1987), pp. 59-64. From Krauss's position, Fried's account is essentially phallocentric. According to Foster, Fried's archeology is less a search for truth than a priestly assertion of mystery.

Although reified in abstractions-with the language of objecthood, theatricality, distance, duration, liter- alism, and presence--Fried's notions likewise display real politics in the social unrest of the 1960s. In that decade, when desegregation was taking civic shape, Fried was still segregat- ing, expressly refusing the encroachment of "unacceptable" ingredients he found threaten- ing in current modernist aesthetics. Smithson's position in his letter to the editor of Artforum branded Fried a "Marxist saint" ("L').</page><page sequence="7">Critical Inquiry Spring 1994 425 Fried found it imperative to resist the growing theatricality in the arts. Already infected with objecthood (Greenberg's own theory had led to this conclusion), the conventional essence of modernist art had turned to the edge or shape of the canvas and the concern for shape now takes center stage.19 This literal reference to a painting's support made art now explicitly conventional-a new "self-imposed imperative that it defeat or suspend its own objecthood through the medium of shape" ("AO," p. 125). As opposed to the minimalist claims of objecthood, Fried de- clared that what made Noland's, Olitski's, and Stella's paintings convinc- ing images was their fusion of both a recognition of painting as a literalist object and their explicit reference to the literal surface of the canvas. Al- ready at work in modernist painting, this strategy was, as Fried saw it, "not basically a matter of program and ideology but of experience, con- viction, and sensibility" ("AO," p. 135), "almost the natural history ... of sensibility," that is, not corrupted by theater ("AO," p. 117). But literalist objects catered to this theatrical presence. "The need to break the fingers of this grip" is what made objecthood an issue for Fried in the 1960s. But also the "starkness and apparent irreconcilability of this conflict" gave Fried's article its polemic necessity ("AO," pp. 137, 135). A great refusal was needed, and Fried responded. In a lecture given on 8 March 1967 at the School of Visual Arts (ulti- mately published as "Art in the One-Dimensional Society"), Herbert Mar- cuse voiced a similar view, one that he had argued since the mid-1950s. For Marcuse, the crisis stemmed from an "inability to define, name and communicate" a goal.20 This ambivalence was the product of "the tech- niques of mass manipulation [that had] developed an entertainment in- dustry which directly controls leisure time," which ultimately defused the potential threat in leisure time-desublimating repressive domination- that late industrial civilization had created.2" Like Fried, Marcuse felt that the aesthetic dimension was losing its semblance of independence, even though, for Marcuse, "the aesthetic quality of enjoyment, even enter- tainment, has been inseparable from the essence of art, no matter how tragic, how uncompromising the work of art is" (EC, p. 145). Yet Marcuse's great refusal differed radically from Fried's. He ques- tioned the very possibility of art in a totalitarian, affluent society. For Marcuse, civilized man had to "learn to forget the claim for timeless and 19. By the mid-1960s, Fried had parted company with his mentor Greenberg-deny- ing the latter's concept of universal essence in pictorial art and the linear development toward that fulfillment. By 1967, essence for Fried meant "what, at a given moment, is capable of compelling conviction" ("AO," p. 124). 20.

Fried displayed the presence of theatricality in liter- alist work but purely resisted it with his notion of presentness. In Fried's timeless, instantaneous relationship between observer and art, an eternity of pleasure was somehow achieved. Although Smithson disregarded Mar- cuse's vision, he opposed actively Fried's return to an aesthetic Garden of Eden. Fried'sform of resistance against a totally administered society would by the mid-1970s become an unacceptable aesthetic position for the Octo- berists, who have continued to argue for an art of resistance but from a deconstructive base. Their position assumes that systems of connotations, that is, the already known, the already given, are what produce meaning in successful art. Denotations-the so-called originality of an artist-exist only to identify those preceding codes.23 In the early 1980s, Fried re- sponded to this shift of affairs by subtly reformulating the basis of his argument in "Art and Objecthood." In the 1982 essay "How Modernism Works," Fried no longer assumed "the existence of a distinct realm of the pictorial," nonspecific (formalist) concerns. He maintained, "on the con- trary that modernist painting, in its constantly renewed effort to discover what it must be, is forever driven 'outside' itself, compelled to place in jeopardy its very identity by engaging with what it is not."24 But Fried's 1960s concept of painting as "something [that] compels conviction" was not about how art was forever driven outside itself-if by that one means what is currently being argued as the socialization of visuality, how soci- etal codes inscribe aesthetic habits of perception-but was a story of how art was compelled to place in jeopardy its very identity by an engagement in or "continually in response to, the vital [art] of the recent past" ("AO," pp. 123-24 n. 4). In a sense, Fried has become two persons, or was so all along as Smithson claimed in his 1967 letter to Artforum: "Could it be there is a double Michael Fried-the atemporal Friend and the temporal Fried?" ("I"). The Octoberists have adopted a similar position. They also pro- claim a double Michael Fried; one, an intelligent orchestrator, staging a 22. Smithson's response to Marcuse's plea was similar to the one he had for Fried; both pleas were unacceptable forms of Utopia. 23. See Krauss, "Poststructuralism and the 'Paraliterary,"' October, no. 13 (Summer 1980): 36-40. In 1986, Krauss continued to pursue the issues of sociality: "The gendered body, the specificity of site in relation to its political and institutional dimensions-these forms of resistance to abstract spectatordom have been, and are now, where one looks for whatever is critical" (Krauss, contribution to "Theories of Art after Minimalism and Pop," p. 64). 24.

Nonetheless, Stephen Melville has assessed how the Octoberists' semiotic campaign-despite their proclaimed distance from the modernist dis- course of the 1960s-structurally mirrors (in its inversion) the aesthetics of Michael Fried.25 It seems only appropriate that another current ac- count has updated Fried into a semiologist.26 Smithson, too, responded from a similar position, but, as I will argue, his use of the conventions of the picturesque-sublime was an aesthetics of radical participation rather than one of resistance, the Octoberist image of his art. The theory and practice of the picturesque revolves around how a natural setting is "staged" in art, that is, how to image the natural as if it imitated art. It became popular for eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English travelers to chronicle a search for landscapes worthy of a paint- ing. This eighteenth-century notion of the picturesque had expanded by the twentieth century to include anything that was picturelike or appro- priate for reproduction. But the category of the picturesque-sublime had been reinvested with its earlier reliance on the ruin when the scholarly literature on the subject of the picturesque resurfaced throughout the 25. See Stephen W. Melville, Philosophy Beside Itself" On Deconstruction and Modernism (Minneapolis, 1986). Recognizing the recolonizing of Fried's aesthetics by the Octoberists is the core of Stephen Melville's argument: "'Postmodernism'-insofar as it is characterized by its allegorical impulse--represents the freeing of painting from its prison of opti- cality.... But we do well to see how small a liberation this is.... it is still true also that 'paintings are made to be beheld'-'opticality' is but one name for, interpretation of, this 'primordial convention"' (Stephen Melville, "Notes on the Reemergence of Allegory, the Forgetting of Modernism, the Necessity of Rhetoric, and the Conditions of Publicity in Art and Criticism," October, no. 19 [Winter 1981]: 80). Melville concludes that despite the Octo- berists' claim that the deconstructive impulse is characteristic of postmodern art (and that it be distinguished from the self-critical tendency of modernism), at the heart of their cam- paign lies Fried's own internal dialectic. Melville feels that the Octoberists have taken "a position that is fundamentally not different from (only later than) the position Fried has been building all these years - and it is powerful, if it is, precisely because this is what it is" (ibid., p. 90). 26. See Richard Shiff, "Art History and the Nineteenth-Century Realism and Resis- tance," Art Bulletin 70 (Mar. 1988): 25-48. In this essay on the current state of the discipline of nineteenth-century art history, Shiff sees Fried's art historical work as semiological in its structure. Shiff outlines how the notion of the latecomer-how one (be it a critic or an artist) related to the most recent past (tradition)-is the core of all Fried's ongoing projects, as well as the work of Bryson. Shiff displaces the phenomenological force of Fried's earlier account of modern art: "Fried might be identified with phenomenology more readily than with semiology, but for simplicity [?] I am maintaining a certain dynamic (involving semiol- ogy and psychoanalysis) that pertains to both Bryson and Fried" (p. 38 n. 56).</page><page sequence="10">428 Ron Graziani Smithson's Picturable Situation 1960s.27 In other words, the use of the picturesque was anything but dor- mant in the 1960s, and Smithson's aesthetics will be seen as historically conscious detours through the category of the picturesque-sublime. Since the inaugural 1976 issue of the Octoberists' in-house journal October, the group has relied on Smithson's art as an aesthetic equivalent to their poststructuralist theories. While doing so, however, they have consistently displaced the conventions of the picturesque in his work. In October's first issue, the coauthors of the article titled "Gravity's Rainbow and the Spiral Jetty" (which initiated the first of a continuing series of articles on the art by Smithson) mention the picturesque only in passing, quoting from Smithson's last published article, his 1973 review of the Frederick Law Olmsted retrospective at the Whitney Museum. Worth printing in full, the quotation is always used when tying Smithson to the origins of the picturesque. As Smithson argued: Inherent in the theories of Price and Gilpin, and in Olmsted's re- sponse to them, are the beginnings of a dialectic of the landscape. Burke's notion of "beautiful" and "sublime" functions as a thesis of smoothness, gentle curves, and delicacy of nature, and as an antithesis of terror, solitude and vastness of nature, both of which are rooted in the real world, rather than in a Hegelian ideal. Price and Gilpin provide a synthesis with their formulation of the "picturesque."'28 But the coauthors of the October article simply quote this statement and, without pursuing the issue of the picturesque, go on to locate the post- beautiful and post-sublime in Smithson's art. The substance of the pic- turesque in Smithson's art was-and has subsequently continued to be for the Octoberists-displaced through the Benjamin/Barthes con- nection. 27. For example, see Walter John Hipple, The Beautiful, the Sublime, and the Picturesque in Eighteenth-Century British Aesthetic Theory (Carbondale, Ill., 1957); Carl Paul Barbier, Wil- liam Gilpin: His Drawings, Teachings, and Theory of the Picturesque (Oxford, 1963), and Christo- pher Hussey, The Picturesque: Studies in a Point of View (Hamden, Conn., 1967). In the second half of the 1960s, the discipline of art history was also defining the connection between the picturesque-sublime landscape paintings of the nineteenth century and the European industrial network. Barbara Novak's work at Columbia University stands out as an ex- ample. The Columbia connection has continued to the present day in the work of Albert Boime, whose Art in the Age of Bonapartism, 1800-1815, 2 vols. (Chicago, 1990) details the relationship between the aesthetics of the picturesque and the economics of using our envi- ronment. Boime's thoughtful insights have also played a role in writing this essay. 28.

See Smithson, "Frederick Law Olmsted and the Dialectical Landscape," The Writings of Robert Smithson, p. 119. Both William Gilpin and Uvedale Price helped gener- ate the eighteenth-century versions of the picturesque. The attraction of this quote for the Octoberists seems to be its date, 1973, which does not necessarily implicate Smithson's prior work with the picturesque.</page><page sequence="11">Critical Inquiry Spring 1994 429 Although the Octoberists have repressed the picturesqueness of Smithson's art, they have not avoided the category altogether. In fact, they have gone so far as to give the picturesque a poststructuralist look. One of October's cofounders, Rosalind Krauss, argued in her article "The Originality of the Avant-Garde: A Postmodernist Repetition" that a schism had developed in modernism between theory and practice. She describes how initially, in the eighteenth century, the parameters of origi- nality and repetition were interrelational; using the eighteenth-century formation of the picturesque as a prime example, she shows how the natural-as-landscape requires both halves of the singular/formulaic cou- pling to be operative. But over time, modernist practice repressed or dis- credited repetition while emphasizing singularity or originality, even to the point (and this is her point) of not being a component of the multiple. For Krauss, the resultant cult of originality (modernism) reads as a valori- zation of the picturesque equation. Krauss replaces this mark of the modern-in which originality is fixed to some transcendent signified-with her mark of the postmodern, in which every signifier defers only to another signifier rather than to some absent signified. The reality of the copy structured the underlying condition of the original as it did the theory of the picturesque. Sketches that captured changing moments in the topography of a natural setting allowed for the maintenance of singularity. Nonetheless, she concludes, "The very notion of landscape is constructed as a second term of which the first is a representation." Landscape as a "pictorial type ... is not single (or singular) but multiple, conventional, a series of recipes about roughness, chiaroscuro, ruins and abbeys, and therefore, when the effect is found in the world at large, that natural array is simply felt to be re- peating another work-a 'landscape'-that already exists elsewhere."29 But when Krauss pursues the art by Smithson (as she often does), her interpretation again attaches the reappearance of the formulaic in his art to the modernist discourse of Benjamin and Barthes and their analysis of the photographic medium, while avoiding the notion of the picturesque. On the other side of the critical divide, the mainstream story in art history is significantly different. In 1974, when the New York Cultural Center held an exhibition of Smithson's drawings, his relationship to the picturesque received its historic pedigree. In his essay for the show, critic Joseph Masheck described Smithson's drawings and writings as "vision- ary schemes ... [steeped] in the dialectic of garden history, especially the displacement of the seventeenth-century French and Italian formal garden by the irregular, artfully naturalistic 'English garden' of the eight- eenth century." In his 1973 article, Smithson "evidences his affinity with" Olmsted and Central Park, which became a "democratic blow-up of the 29.

Stevens ("SE," p. 23). Masheck also attaches Smithson's more "fantastic," architecturally violent drawings to Piranesi's Carceri etchings, whose "characteristic ruination and his sub- limity of scale" brought the sublime into the parameters of Smithson's use of the picturesque ("SE," p. 25). But what of Smithson's own response to the tradition of the pictur- esque? When defining the aesthetic parameters to which he was opposed, he did not necessarily reject Fried's return to the garden as such (after all, much of Smithson's art was tied to New Jersey, the Garden State), but, as Smithson stated, "the certainty of the absolute garden will never be regained.""' In 1968 Smithson wrote a manifesto of sorts titled "A Sedimentation of the Mind: Earth Projects." The essay narrated how to view the signifi- cance of earth art. He began the article with an allegorization conflating a sublime mental condition with various entropic geological activities, but he turned quickly to the problem of how to apprehend the human factor in the environment. Smithson's solution was to image the technological activities that mediated this relationship before the mediating process had been cleaned up. As he stated, "the actual disruption of the earth's crust" before "the finished project" cleaned it up "is at times very compel- ling" ("SM," p. 83). Just prior to his "Sedimentation" essay, Smithson had written "A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey," the travelogue of his trip to a construction site of a highway in Passaic. Intentionally associating with promotional tours that used the picturesque to stimulate commercial interests even in areas of urban redevelopment, Smithson chose the Passaic site and posted the following: SEE THE MONUMENTS OF PASSAIC, NEW JERSEY. What can you find in Passaic that you cannot find in Paris, London or Rome? Find out for yourself.

The ruins Smithson chose would not even survive their most imme- diate future, the completed highway. In addition, by reconceptualizing the sublime ingredient in this "suburban odyssey" as a slow, drawn out, low-energy form of entropic inevitability-instead of the traditional pic- torial image of an awe-inspiring powerful force-Smithson's narrative of modern society's entropic confinement collided with those seeking tran- scendence. The year before, in the travelogue "The Crystal Land" (1966), Smithson had narrated a trip he took with a few artists and friends to the mineral-rich quarry of the Upper Montclair site in northern New Jersey. From the article's initial alphabetical listing of over fifty minerals that make up the crystals and rocks found in the quarry's lava bed to the displays on the car's dashboard, descriptive passages that transverse the surface of matter determine the entire essay. Smithson pointedly men- tions-his only moment of depth analysis in the essay- that "out of sight in the glove compartment was a silver flashlight and an Esso map of Ver- mont,""34 "a dewy green setting" ("SM," p. 89). This trip was not an excur- sion into a pastoral but a sublime setting, one that "did look dangerous," yet a series of processes-"fragmentation, corrosion, decomposition, dis- integration, rock creep [a type of slow erosion found in quarries], debris slides, mud flow, avalanche"-distanced the terror with nostalgia or de- light.35 Occurring in an abandoned industrial quarry, these geological processes were nonetheless man-induced, their ruins apparent every- where. The group collected what remained of a lava mound near the center of the quarry and returned to New York. Shortly after this excursion, Smithson traveled to Passaic and wrote "A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey" for Artforum.36 Using the added incentive of the photograph, Smithson tried to stimulate tours to the Passaic construction site. Here, too, Smithson's article participated 32. Smithson, flyer, microfilm reel 3833, frame no. 1176, AAA. 33. As Smithson argued in 1972, "Rome is like a big scrap heap of antiquities.

In a 1900 ar- ticle titled "A Plea for the Picturesqueness of New York," the author claimed that "picturesqueness was no longer a pictorial quality limited to pastoral scenes; it could also be found in the cityscape."'37 Many of these earlier photographic travelogues stimulated expansion into the wilder- ness (as well as into the cities) and used the photograph as a credible form of documentational education, even though that "documentation" relied on the conventions of the picturesque to stabilize the contradictions ex- posed by the intrusion of technology into nature. Smithson's central snapshot of the bridge at Passaic and his long picturesque description of it played havoc with this urbanization of the picturesque tradition.38 Calling the "machine in the garden" a coparticipant in nature's "heaps," Smithson's subsequent 1968 manifesto narrated the massive earthmoving machinery competing with the "destructive" forces of na- ture itself.39 Caught in the act, the technological process turns its "terrain into unfinished cities of organized wreckage" ("SM," p. 83). He suggests how an earth artist could investigate the process of the machine in the garden, staging the technological/geological activity a second time and mirroring technology's effect on nature with the artist's own "chaotic ... infinity of heaps." Raw matter may have been the physical substance of Smithson's earth art, but technological processes supplied the rationale to its lying in heaps. Further, the garden may have been Smithson's site, but process-the "methods of procedure," the "'fundamental elements of the machine' " (Smithson, quoting T. E. Hulme) in that garden-inter- ested Smithson so as to "break with the focused limits of rational tech- nique" ("SM," p. 84). Into this garden, Smithson felt, the modernists (that is, Fried) feared to tread. Smithson claims that Fried was unable to deal with this terrain, a terrain similar to the nighttime car ride that in 1965 artist Tony Smith risked and chronicled on the "unfinished New Jersey turnpike" ("SM," 37. Susan Danly, introduction, in The Railroad in American Art: Representations of Techno- logical Change, ed. Danly and Leo Marx (Cambridge, Mass., 1988), p. 33. 38. Smithson found himself caught up in these ideological needs. Descriptive passages in his original manuscript for "The Crystal Land" had been edited out, for example, a long list of disparate fragmentary statements that issued from his rented car's radio. And when his Artforum article "The Monuments of Passaic" showed Smithson moving toward a dialec- tical model for growth and away from the charms of obsolescence promoted in his "The Crystal Land" piece, the editor of Harper's Magazine-a publication with a long history of commitment to the picturesque travelogue-turned down Smithson's proposal for a follow- up article. See Smithson, correspondence with Robert Kotlowitz, microfilm reel 3833, frame no. 1092, AAA. In this letter, Kotlowitz, editor-in-chief of Harper's Magazine, stated his inability "to make a firm commitment" on publishing "Monuments of Passaic, New Jer- sey" because the piece was too "elliptical in style." 39. If this passage sounds a lot like Leo Marx, The Machine in the Garden: Technology and the Pastoral Ideal in America (New York, 1964), it is intentional. These words and this phrase as well as a fpotnote to Marx's book come from an unpublished portion of the manuscript for Smithson's 1973 article on Olmsted.</page><page sequence="15">Critical Inquiry Spring 1994 433 p. 84).40 At the unfinished turnpike a "suspension of boundaries" occurs; similarly, Smithson's "bins or containers in [his] Non-Sites gather in the fragments that are experienced in the physical abyss of raw matter" ("SM," pp. 84, 85). But it was under the section labeled "Better Homes and Industries" that Smithson's "Sedimentation" manifesto dealt specifi- cally with the English "antiformal" version of the garden ("SM," p. 85). Smithson uses the sculptures of Anthony Caro (whose work Fried found most compelling in the 1960s) to describe how in their outdoor settings they became "industrial ruins." They participate in the tradition of ro- mantic ruins, "a contrived, but tamed, 'wildness' that echoes to the tradi- tion of English gardening .... A leftover Arcadia. . .. tranquil gardens ... jejune Edens ... an elegant notion of industrialism in the woods; all brings to mind some kind of wasted charm.... full of appeals to ... liber- al-democratic notions of gentry ... the 'happy' ruins of the humanist" ("SM," pp. 85-86). Footnoting his position, Smithson added: The sinister in a primitive sense seems to have its origin in what could be called "quality gardens" (Paradise). Dreadful things seem to have happened in those half-forgotten Edens. Why does the Gar- den of Delights suggest something perverse? Torture gardens. Deer Park. The Grottos of Tiberius. Gardens of Virtue are somehow al- ways "lost." A degraded paradise is perhaps worse than a degraded hell. America abounds in banal heavens, in vapid "happy-hunting grounds," and in "natural" hells like Death Valley National Monu- ment or The Devil's Playground. The public "sculpture garden" for the most part is an outdoor "room," that in time becomes a limbo of modern isms. Too much thinking about "gardens" leads to perplex- ity and agitation. Gardens like the levels of criticism bring one to the brink of chaos. This footnote is turning into a dizzying maze, full of tenuous paths and innumerable riddles. The abysmal problem of gardens somehow involves a fall from somewhere or something. The certainty of the absolute garden will never be regained. ["SM," p. 91 n. 1] What interested Smithson about the industrial garden was its process of construction before a fabricated Arcadia took shape. For Smithson, the significance of earth art lies in its ability to dialectically contain the disrup- tion of a site, that is, its process of construction. More to the point, he meant to mingle the impurities of geological activities and industrial pro- cesses in his art, developing an aesthetics of impurities that necessarily spoiled the ideologies promoted by Fried.41 By defining as entropic both 40. Smithson is quoting Smith, whose interpretation of his car ride was an encounter Fried felt compelled to dismantle in "AO," p. 19. 41.

Smithson participated in several ways in the aesthetic forum of the picturesque-sublime. In "A Museum of Language in the Vicinity of Art," he argued that the art "museum, a creation of the 19th century, quite naturally adopted the popular mode of the Renaissance for its content." 42 "Trapped" in that "temporality," art museums, Smithson argued, disavow prehistory (read, age of dinosaurs) and a posthistory (read, flying sau- cers). Smithson, however, was attracted to the "sense of extreme past and future" staged in the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), which avoids "any reference to the Renaissance." But as Smithson ob- served, "there is nothing 'natural' about the Museum of Natural History. 'Nature' [in the AMNH] is simply another 18th- and 19th-century fiction" and, I would add, one structured through the conventions of the pictur- esque ("ML," p. 71).43 As Smithson claimed, the "dinosaurism" of Charles Knight's imagery, which Smithson described as "a kind of cartoon vision [or one could say a picturesque-sublime version] of the cosmos" ("ML," p.72), recreated the past for the AMNH. And inversely "this art is never seen in museums outside of the M.N.H., because it doesn't fit in with the contrived 'art-histories' of Modernism or the Renaissance," which I would again add are institutionalized forums for the aesthetic categories of the beautiful and sublime ("ML," p. 72). Smithson had already played out this connection with the AMNH in his article, "The Domain of the Great Bear," which he cowrote with artist Mel Bochner. In typical Smithson fashion, they begin the article as a sub- lime encounter at the Hayden Planetarium. The text quickly turns to the planetarium's picturesqueness as the artist-writers (in true Barthesian 42. Everett Ellin, "Museums as Media," ICA Bulletin, no. 169 (May 1967): 14; quoted in Smithson, "A Museum of Language in the Vicinity of Art," The Writings of Robert Smithson, p. 71; hereafter abbreviated "ML." 43. In one of October's more recent articles, Ann Reynolds discusses how Smithson's Non-Sites are structurally related to AMNH's "habitats," but she only once mentions the cate- gory of the picturesque when referring to the type of snapshots Smithson took while pur- suing his 1969 Non-Site in Germany. Displayed through the semiotic notion of how the metonymic affect of both the AMNH floor displays or habitats and Smithson's Non-Sites locate the logic of the index, Reynolds continues the initial formula used by the Octoberists to mark out the postmodern arena. Reynolds ignores how the habitats of the AMNH institu- tionalize the pictorial parameters of the picturesque; how, as Reynolds sees it, the overall look of the habitats at the AMNH were (and are) staged to look like nature, that is, both natural-like (in arrangement of parts) yet picturelike in overall look. See Ann Reynolds, "Reproducing Nature: The Museum of Natural History as Nonsite," October, no. 45 (Sum- mer 1988): 109-12. I contend that this formula of an original-yet-a-copy structuring the theoretical tracts on the picturesque also structures the habitats at the AMNH as it struc- tured the Non-Sites of Smithson.</page><page sequence="17">Critical Inquiry Spring 1994 435 form) transverse the surface of the structure itself, arguing that "nothing is known but the impenetrable surfaces."44 Similar to how Barthes located the illusion of depth-for example, the authorial presence-in decay, the Smithson / Bochner team used the presence of decay to stage the solar system at the Hayden Planetarium as a fabricated illusion. Through their descriptive passages, the artist-writers capture the artificiality and tenta- tiveness of the infrastructure used to contain the solar system at the Hay- den Planetarium. In their essay, as Smithson says in "A Museum of Language in the Vicinity of Art," "history breaks down into fabulous lies, that reveal nothing but copies of copies" ("ML," p. 73). The authors point out signs of wear and decay throughout Hayden's simulated system. They describe the "mechanical collection of tracks, boxes, bulbs, gears, arma- tures, rods," as "tired, torpid ... a chamber of ennui. And fatigue" ("DGB," p. 25). They remark that the once "white" Viking rocket display is "marred in spots, gray, somehow decadent," while they depict the mu- ral room, with its black light and various sublime renditions of celestial phenomena, as "a replica of quasi-deaths." The whole essay becomes a travelogue into "forbidden zones," where "'nature' is simulated and turned into 'handpainted' photographs," (another version of the pictur- esque-sublime in which the natural and the artificial mingle) and "history no longer exists" ("DGB," pp. 26, 31). This form of reading the surfaces of the AMNH in decay is intentionally Barthesian, but it also taps into the conventions of the picturesque. I have tried to suggest that for Smithson returning to the garden as such was not the problem; preventing a return to the certainty of an absolute garden was. In this light, art critic Sidney Tillim's 1968 charac- terization of Smithson's Passaic travelogue as a parody of the picturesque doesn't seem too far off the mark.45 Yet Smithson objected to Tillim's emphasis on the Instamatic camera and its relationship to the European or "pictorial" tradition of the picturesque.46 Indeed, Tillim had bypassed how Smithson had also given a conceptual shape to the parameters of the picturesque-sublime, how Smithson mingled the material (formal) with the conceptual mechanics of the picturesque-sublime. He ignored how Smithson "was interested in zeroing in on those aspects of mental experi- ence that somehow coincide with the physical world."47 Smithson dis- agreed with his fellow conceptualists that the idea was the most important 44.

It was one part of the aesthetic experience but no more significant than Smithson's snapshots of the site or the tour- ist excursions he led to the site. In an unpublished essay titled "Picturable Situations and Infra Maps," circa 1968, Smithson pursued both the "mental language of pic- tures" and the materiality of the natural. With language as the basis of our thoughts, Smithson argues that "our very notions of meaning, under- standing, sense, symbol, are so bound up with language ... that they cannot be totally pried away from it." Defining "the rules and conven- tions in ... picturableness," he describes how "negative picturemakers such as Ad Reinhardt" tried to dismiss the "corrupted syntax of the pic- ture." But, according to Smithson, the blank canvases of Reinhardt in their mere negation of the picturable were nonetheless only silent within their "perfect and absolute blank." Or, as Smithson argues, in Reinhardt's paintings "the language of the picture becomes a painting of silence." At its most negative, "a painting is nothing but the absence of a picture." Even a negative painting cannot be detached from some pictorial lan- guage. For Smithson, Reinhardt was a "negative picture maker main- taining the convention of the false window or mirror." Arguing for the return of a double meaning in art, Smithson calls for a conceptual format that did not refuse the picturable but established mental counterparts of the pictorial language, locating "the hidden duality" or "double mean- ing" in picturable situations.48 Smithson also used the art by Jasper Johns (specifically one of Johns's map paintings) to describe the other extreme, the opposite of Reinhardt's art, within the picturable situation. Smithson saw Johns's map paintings as "true pictures of a false painting ... the very paint in Johns map [paintings] seems to exist as a material fact that is somehow untrue" ("PS," frame no. 463). Johns's thick, encrusted materiality in his paintings was not what Smithson wanted to mingle with his conceptual infrastructure. Even Johns's paint-as-fact was too artificial or cultured: raw minerals fabricated into paint.49 Smithson's picturable situation meant s(t)imulating one's access to the natural, staging the tension be- tween the real and artificial without camouflaging either ingredient. For example, Smithson pointed to Lewis Carroll's "The Hunting of the Snark"; although the Bellman's map was blank, it "reflected a mental language of pictures" locating "the silence" that occurs in the "negation 48. Smithson, "Picturable Situations and Infra Maps," microfilm reel 3834, frame nos. 460-64, AAA; hereafter abbreviated "PS." 49. If one wanted to keep Smithson within the modernist parameters, one could even argue that Smithson's Non-Sites are nothing more than the materials of what paint is- crushed rocks contained by a (bin)der. This image becomes even more pertinent consider- ing how Smithson's Non-Site containers are now often being displayed in museums without the maps and photos that made up his Non-Sites.</page><page sequence="19">Critical Inquiry Spring 1994 437 of the picturable"-a type of looking-glass negation ("PS, frame 463).50 In 1968, Smithson gave this conceptualization its concrete form in his Mono Lake Non-Site. With his Non-Sites, Smithson had successfully contained the double meaning of a picturable situation. As forms of containment, however, the Non-Sites were nonetheless always jeopardized forms of consolidating a relationship between the artificial and the natural, consistently avoiding a pictorial synthesis of that tension. Smithson used what he called an "infra- physical" network of maps, photos, and bins to structure his Non-Sites, but they differed from the metaphysical way to map a terrain. For Smith- son, his infrasystems were not beyond (meta) but below-"an order that is not visible to the natural eye yet capable of being made physical by the artist."5' The Octoberists have subsequently promoted Smithson's formula of containment as an aesthetic activity of resistance, emphasizing how na- ture (that which is referenced) is continuously and forever slipping out of the reach of Smithson's infrasystem (signifiers). Smithson himself, when discussing his Non-Sites, seems to concur, describing how "the [external] site is evading you all the while [the maps, photos, and piles of rocks in the Non-Sites] were directing you to it." His Non-Sites referenced a particu- lar site, but as Smithson stated, "there's no way to find what's out there. Yet you're directed out there" ("FC," p. 113). In his 1980 article "The Allegorical Impulse: Toward a Theory of Postmodernism," Craig Owens redefined this conceptual makeup through his notion of the postmodern allegorical impulse (PAI). The dominant voice in the highly influential 1984 anthology "Rethinking Representation: Art after Modernism," Owens argued that the postmodern "allegorist does not invent images but confiscates them. He lays claim to the culturally significant, poses as its interpreter. And in his hands an image becomes something other (allos = other + agoreuei = to speak)." 52 In other words, the postmodern brand of allegory assumed its referent yet made it problematic. Owens claimed that a critical edge of this postmodern allegorical impulse lay in "its capacity to rescue from historical oblivion that which threatens to dis- appear," that which modernism has repressed ("AI," p. 68). For Owens, it was in how that rescue took shape that he would apprehend the sig- 50. "Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!

But, again, not only how that rescue took shape but what was confiscated is of concern here. For Owens, the current form of allegory enacts itself as a supplementary form of appropriation, one which constantly defers any promise of unified narrative coherence. That is, the PAI is a type of nar- rative that solicits yet frustrates the conventional desire for direct trans- parent meaning (see "AI," p. 70). Through the PAI parameters, the traditional use of the signifier's relationship to the signified is delayed, if not blocked.53 The PAI was a type of criticism (art making or even history telling) that could be productive in its activity, that is, able to confront and change our basic commonsensical (or humanist) assumptions, rather than a type of consumptive criticism that merely reproduces (is an accomplice to) the theoretical mechanisms that only help to stabilize our present societal form. The hope was that this change in the use of sign systems could lead to a new mode of production in societal discourse.54 Owens's postmodern allegorical impulse was desire itself rearing its head to fight modernism's hegemonic form of aesthetics, which, since the eighteenth century, he argued, had defined the poetics of the allegorical structure as a rhetorical procedure, as a mere extension of or an attachment to the essence of mod- ern aesthetics. Turning the modernist theory of the allegory on its head, Owens argued in his 1979 article "Detachment from the Parergon" that the modernist theory of allegory was a form of misrecognition. It re- pressed the fact that allegory had initially been an inherent ingredient in modernism. That is, allegory was not an extension of modern aesthetics, a mere attachment to its pure essence, a parergon of modernism. And as a deconstructive activity, the PAI posed a real threat for modernism; it could potentially replace modernism. This power of resistance defined not only the significance of the postmodern allegorical impulse for Owens but also the art (both art objects and writings) by Robert Smithson. Several ingredients distinguish the detaching (or postmodern) im- pulse of Smithson's allegorical art. The "allegorical emblem par excel- 53. For further discussion on this issue, see Owens, "Detachment from the Parergon," October no. 9 (Summer 1979): 42-49. Owens's definition of the supplement in his article is itself a reading of Jacques Derrida, Truth in Painting, trans. Geoff Bennington and Ian McLeod (Chicago, 1987). For Owens the supplement was "not a simple addition to, it also supplants. It adds only to replace" (p. 43). 54. For example, the allegorical impulse was a means for Owens to deconstruct the conventional formulas determining the discipline of art history. Owens claimed that his critical analysis was of a sort that would help bring on the death of art as a capitalist com- modity of luxury. Or as Owens stated, "It would counteract the division of artistic labor in a society that restricts the artist to the manufacture of luxury goods destined for the real agents of art world appropriation" (Owens, "Sherrie Levine at A&amp;M Artworks," Art in America 20 [Summer 1982]: 148). The Octoberist Benjamin Buchloh makes this argument for the productivist art of the Russian avant garde artists in the 1910s and 1920s. See Benja- min H. D. Buchloh, "From Faktura to Factography," October no. 30 (Fall 1984): 82-219.</page><page sequence="21">Critical Inquiry Spring 1994 439 lence" that Owens uses to attest to the role of resistance in Smithson's art lies in his use of the ruin ("AI," p. 70).55 Doubled through Walter Benjamin's writing, Smithson's use of the ruin stands for history as an irreversible process of disillusion and decay. Owens sees the allegorical imaging of the ruin as a rearticulation of a fragmentary past absorbed into the present landscape attesting-in a self-evident way-to an act of appropriation.56 This postmodernist act confines meaning in its site specificity, just as a ruin appears to have merged physically into its setting. Tied to the dura- tion of the site, the ruin is unable to transcend that locality; imperma- nence becomes another factor as does contingency. And together these ingredients locate a marker, a single coherent impulse, one that Owens views as operative in Smithson's work. In his 1979 review of Smithson's writings titled "Earthwords," Owens tells of how Smithson's 1966 "A Heap of Languages" and his 1972 "Strata: A Geophotographic Fiction" "offer words to vision" where the visual com- positional formulas figure language as having physical properties. Smith- son's writings/objects attest to the "eclipse of nature by language"; that is, language as discourse eclipses modernism's symbolic formula."' Here, too, although Owens recounts how Smithson may talk of "illusions of freedom yet warns against them," he emphasizes Smithson's use of the montage formula as a means to push the mind (and these are Smithson's words) "out to 'the unfocused fringe,' where it 'loses its boundaries and a sense of the oceanic pervades.'" This is where "'a network of signs ... [are] discovered as you go along"' ("E," p. 120). For Owens, Smithson's writings/objects testify "to the eruption of language into the field of the visual arts," an eruption that is "coincident with, if not the definitive in- dex of, the emergence of postmodernism" ("E," p. 122). In Owens's dis- course, language-and this now means language equipped with its formulaic parameters as discourse-replaces the modernist notion of es- sence as the site of meaning. Owens reads Smithson's Non-Sites as texts, which stage the loss of the center, or at least a center that is ever ex- 55. Owens's analysis of the postmodernist ruin is a doubling of the theory of the alle- gorical cult of the ruin as defined in various articles and essays by Walter Benjamin. In Origin of German Tragic Drama, trans. John Osborne (London, 1977), Benjamin outlines how the structural activity of the allegorical had been devalued. In Charles Baudelaire: A Lyric Poet in the Era of High Capitalism, trans. Harry Zohn (London, 1973), he pursues the reemergence of the allegorical impulse in Baudelaire's writing. And in "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," Illuminations, trans. Zohn, ed. Hannah Arendt (New York, 1968), pp. 217-51, he defines the allegorical attributes of the photograph. 56. This notion of appropriation has also been pursued through the postmodern cult of quotations. Here, too, one could note this desire in Smithson, who in the 1960s was a leading practitioner in the use of quotations. Many of Smithson's writings are composed of a vast repertory of quotations, ranging from obscure books to television shows, used idiosyncratically, often plagiaristically (aesthetically) or intentionally misattributed. In "DGB," quotations surround a framed text. 57.

In the process they destabilize accepted modern- ist notions.59 Owens's image of Smithson's art attests to this postmodern allegori- cal impulse. The piles of rocks (collected for the Non-Sites) refer to the natural, but as bins of debris-Smithson usually culled his piles of rocks or soil from abandoned industrial sites-they "affirm their own contin- gency and arbitrariness," nature already made over into something else ("AI," p. 71). Owens describes how Smithson's use of the montage tech- nique-bringing together maps, photos, language, sculpture, and so on-enacted an indexical situation. The Non-Site establishes a material congruence between signifier (Smithson's maps, photos, bins) and what was signified (the external site referenced by the Non-Sites), a relationship that continuously displaced the signified.6o For Owens, Smithson's alle- gorical formula lies where the symbolic model (read, modernism's way of uniting form and content as immediate or direct) is doubled yet distanced through the indexical model. The montage technique itself actualizes the problem of referencing in Smithson's art, indexing the activity of refer- encing as always a form of interference or mediation. Through a "syntax of splits and ruptures" (Smithson quoted in "E," p. 124), the sign of the natural in Smithson's Non-Sites is re-presented as intact yet distanced. Smithson's montage method, strategies of accumulation of "one thing after another [that] tend to cut across and subtend all categorizations," becomes metonymic in process, yet synthetic in nature ("AI," p. 72). For 58. This type of visual site specificity is a doubling of Derrida's notion of language as discourse, a decentering experience that unfolds in time through speech. 59. Ultimately, Owens ties Smithson's work to both Derrida's deconstruction and Fou- cault's archeology, and, as such, claims that Smithson's art should be given its pride of place. 60. Here, Owens uses what had become, by the late 1970s, a primary Octoberist marker for apprehending significant contemporary art. In 1977, Krauss defined a significant post- modernist marker in her "Notes on the Index: Seventies Art in America," pt. 2, October no. 3 (Spring 1977): 68-81. She found that marker in the logic of the index. The indexical situation fixes the site of meaning as necessarily contingent upon its context. Krauss's picto- rial analogy is the logic of the photograph. Coupled with the writings of Benjamin and Barthes's theoretical enframement of the photograph, the logic of the index runs some- thing like this: at best a sign acts as a trace of a cause, a direct relationship to which the trace refers yet from which the cause is necessarily absent. This is the logic of the photograph. It bears an indexical relationship to its referent (nature itself)-that is, the photo's light- sensitive film has a direct immediate contact with the real materiality of light itself-yet it can only register that "having been there" (a Barthesian notion) relationship as a trace with its external referent necessarily absent. This "message without a code" (again a Barthesian notion) is but a trace in the photograph, and, as such, any attempt to stabilize that relation- ship requires a supplementary act-something both Benjamin and Barthes argued had become the function of the photo caption.</page><page sequence="23">Critical Inquiry Spring 1994 441 Owens, Smithson's art works/writings have multiple readings that prob- lematize the activity of reading, defining the act of reading (or seeing) as always uncertain, impossible to determine, ultimately promoting yet denying modernism's metaphoric formula. The strength of the PAI lay in its force to deconstruct how it had been devalued by what it has always been part of-modernism. But the realization that, at best, the PAI can only be a supplementary activity caught in the needs of modernism is not a condemnation of its enterprise, a form of resignation. Rather, for Owens the postmodern allegorical im- pulse is an act of resistance, "an attempt to unmask what Derrida calls 'discursivity within the structure of the beautiful' [or in Smithson's case, the sublime], the occupation of a nonverbal field by a conceptual force." 61 But, again, I want to pursue how the "impossible to determine" quality of Smithson's allegorical detours (a conceptual fix on sublimity) were denotations inscribed within the already-known, the already-given con- notative system of the picturesque. Throughout the 1960s, Smithson argued for a dialectical relation- ship between the natural (material) and the artificial (conceptual). But not until he completed his Non-Sites was he able to let the natural mingle dialectically with his conceptual infrasystems. Smithson is often quoted as stating that his earthworks came out of his involvement with the design firm of Tippetts, Abet, McCarthy, and Stratton, who in 1966, with Smith- son as their "artist consultant," were engaged in a project for a Texas air terminal.62 Although he never moved beyond the drawing stage for the airfield project, Smithson began to develop a sense of the expanse and remoteness of large earthworks. The problem Smithson was unable to resolve at the time was how to transmit the proposed earthworks-for which he had commissioned his friends Robert Morris, Sol Lewitt, and Carl Andre-into the center of the terminal. He thought of using tele- scopes or monitors at the site and transmitting the earthworks via televi- sion screens into the terminal. But he saw these solutions as unsuccessful types of mapping, never quite allowing the polarities of the natural and the artificial to meet (see "FC," p. 107). With the Non-Sites Smithson pre- sented an art that mingled opposing tensions; their travelogues contain the disjunctions of that tension. In a sense, the rock bins and the aerial maps in his Non-Sites give the viewer access to the external site from both ends of a telescope-from the minuteness of rock fragments to the larger overall view of the maps-without completely displacing the natural. Smithson inverted this dialectical relationship when he moved from the displacement of the natural within his fabricated Non-Sites-gather- 61. Owens, "Detachment from the Parergon, " p. 43. 62.

In his Asphalt Rundown in Rome, Glue Pour in Vancouver, and Concrete Pour in Chicago, Smithson took fab- ricated (industrially produced) materials and "naturally" resited them as geological flows. Smithson's hypothetical continent / map projects also revolved a- round the fabricated / natural paradigm. Combining map drawings with miniature continent / island masses, Smithson determined the real and the hypothetical while focusing on the defining aspect of a large island mass, its shoreline or that which differentiates a mass from its surround- ings. From mud and stone, Smithson reconstructed the (believed to be long-since submerged) hypothetical continent of Cathaysia and situated its arrangement on quicksand. The rocks and mud literally sank out of sight but also into the site, calling attention to the surrounding vicinity. As Smithson argued, there was no way to locate "the island of rock." Back- ground will always ultimately determine foreground-"there are no fixed points only background" (I, frame 1150). The Hypothetical Continent in Shells: Lemuria followed. Smithson's mapping of the land mass, "sup- posedly covered by the Indian Ocean," relocated it as part of the "real" island of Madagascar.63 The Hypothetical Continent of Gondwanaland came next. Gondwanaland refers to the theorized land mass that has, over the course of millenniums, split into the smaller land masses of Africa, South America, Australia, and India. One part of Smithson's Gondwanaland project consisted of a mound of white limestone positioned on the floor of the Yucatan jungle, the southern edge of North America that will, in theory, ultimately collide with the moving section of Gondwanaland known as South America. Smithson mapped out this white mound as Earth Map for Mexico to Be Placed in the Jungle. The drawing consists of an island of ice ("Great Ice Cap") superimposed over one version of what Gondwanaland might have looked like during the carboniferous period. When submerged (melted), the island of ice would cease to be distinguishable from its surrounding environment, having dispersed in all directions. The glass island/map of Atlantis followed; its theoretical existence had many locations before Smithson's literalization of its hypothetical state on a New Jersey parking lot. By making an "island"'s shoreline out of broken glass, he alluded to water as the machine that slowly reduces glass to sand. Having no specific reference point beyond the parking lot, the island of broken glass had no other external reference point to work toward except the conceptualiza- tion of its mapping. In 1971, Smithson constructed several other islands off the coast of Florida, including Sunken Island. But because this "island" 63.

This attitude towards the conventions of the picturesque-sublime surfaced that winter in the Woodshed. Smithson's goal was to improve on the ruined qualities of an abandoned shed (used for storing wood) by pouring dirt on it until its main support cracked under the stress. The early developer of the picturesque, eighteenth-century theorist William Gilpin, described this process of improving on a site's qualities as ruin in his Observations Relative Chiefly to Picturesque Beauty, a series of books with which Smithson was acquainted. Gilpin claimed that the artist had a duty to transform a landscape according to the rules of the picturesque; the artist "may certainly break an ill-formed hillock ... shovel the earth about him, as he pleases. He may throw down a cottage ... on this side or that." In other words, the artists should turn the scene into a rough ruin.66 Smithson took the notion of a shore from his imaginary island proj- ects and retranslated it architecturally at Kent State. The woodshed's in- terior supporting beam was used to define a verbal equivalence of the noun, shore. The architectural notion to shore up was given physical shape through process when Smithson stopped the Pour the moment the main beam in the shed cracked under the stress of the poured dirt. The shed/ pour not only gave conceptual shape to the sublime ingredient in the picturesque. The process both determined the picturesque's convention of triggering waves of submerged emotions while simultaneously termi- nating the tradition of framing-shoring up-those very same oceanic waves of desires with a nostalgic, picturesque image. Smithson's wood- shed/pour defined the sublime ingredient but left one with a sense of "those really frightening problems" attendant on the collapse in nature ("FC," p. 124); conceptually the sublime aspect of the picturesque became a cracking beam. Throughout the latter half of the 1960s, Smithson consistently inter- 64. This island has additional interest, for it was done as the Spiral Jetty in Utah began to be submerged. 65. The chosen site stood at the corner of Rhodes and Summit streets, a woodshed (45' x 18' x 10', three plaster and lathe walls, and two wooden walls on the open side). Using twenty loads of dirt and Rich Helmling operating the backhoe, Smithson had the dirt piled on the right half of the shed. The end result was an artificial hill into which the shed nestled. 66.

And his Yucatin travelogue in 1969 was no exception.67 In the Yucatin, he placed a group of mirrors at vari- ous outdoor sites, photographed their arrangements, dismantled them, and subsequently narrated the result in extended allegorical captions to the photos. In his 1979 article "Photography en abyme," Owens viewed Smith- son's photo-mirror/(de)documentary project as a means to substantiate the Derridian claims of diffrrance.68 For Owens, Smithson's Yucatin proj- ect located the experience of the real as if it were a photograph. The Yucatan travelogue not only collapses ways to distinguish the real from its representation but also prevents any possibility of determining the su- premacy of one over the other, rupturing-in the Derridian sense of a hymen-the classical rhetoric of a photo as having been there or as hav- ing a "message without a code.'"69 Yet even in this most conceptualized of Smithson's picturesque travelogues, "the mental experience" of the ar- ticle was in relation to "the physical activity that went on in Yucatan." For Smithson, "the article was not everything" (I, frame no. 1104). Smithson did argue that societal conventions could not be avoided with an alternative set of rules because ultimately any alternative would become entangled within conventional habits. As Smithson suggested, he could not believe in the Mayan myths (the sight staged in Smithson's nar- rative of the Yucatin site), but he could believe in his own fiction; he could believe in an "integrity of the fiction" ("FC," p. 108). This way of transversing the integrity (grip) of the artificial does push Smithson's art in the direction of an Octoberist reading, but the shape this activity took in his art was already inscribed within the picturesque-sublime. The title "Incidents of Mirror-Travel in the Yucatan," as Masheck pointed out, ref- erences Stevens's travelogue.70 Further, Smithson's allegorical narrative again refers to Gilpin's Observations Relative Chiefly to Picturesque Beauty, which lays out the pedagogical guidelines for the aesthetic category of the 67.

He saw the power of Smithson's project in its textuality. Smithson set up an infinite play of supple- mentary readings in his photos, using the presence of mirrors to double, or index, the photographic process. This kind of internal restaging of the mechanics of a photograph textualized meaning as necessarily always contingent. Owens sees Smithson's photos as de- constructing the notion that meaning in a photo is located between the photo and some external referent (that which the photo images). At best, all that Smithson's photos signal was an intention to signify, showing the photo itself already to be a sign. 69. Roland Barthes, "The Photographic Image," Image, Music, Text, trans. and ed.

Gilpin stated that the "picturesque subject may be treated on canvas two ways. The fact may be represented under its plain circum- stances (historically) or it may be represented under an allegory." Contin- uing, Gilpin claimed "if the subject be treated historically, let the king, or the prince give his daughter away; and let the gentlemen, and ladies of the court attend in their proper dresses. If it be treated in heathen alle- gory, erect the temple of Hymen-let the God himself appear-rear the altar-call in Juno pronuba-and let as many of the gods, and goddesses attend in their different capacities, as may be thought convenient."71 In "Incidents of Mirror-Travel in the Yucatan," Smithson describes the site as an "enchanted region where down is up" and calls on the gods in his allegorical description of the experience. The air conditioner in the rented car becomes "the voice of Eecath-the god of thought and wind.... In the rear-view mirror appeared Tezcatlipoca-demiurge of the 'smoking-mirror.'" Tezcatlipoca, speaking to Smithson, tells him "'all those guide books are of no use. You must travel at random, like the first Mayans, you risk getting lost in the thickets, but that is the only way to make art.' "72 The whole article/expedition revolves around nine allegori- cal mirror containments. But whose Hymen-the god of marriage-is this? Smithson's allegory doesn't simply reproduce Gilpin's pedagogical demands for decorum, nor does it fully belong with the Octoberist Der- ridian hymen. The point is this: for the Octoberists, contingency and conventions play a major role in defining the significance of any art, but they nonethe- less ignore the conventions of the picturesque-sublime in the art by Smithson. Smithson's projects can be attached to the postmodern allegor- ical impulse-a marriage or seal by necessity-but only by repressing Smithson's use of the allegorical as a form of participation in the tradition of the picturesque. In terms of the art by Smithson, I would suggest a marriage by necessity between the picturesque-sublime and the PAI, de- spite the convenient rupture that has subsequently occurred between the two. Yet an important difference exists between them. We can view Smithson's Yucatan project as a place where words are turned into stone, in the semiotic sense that language is not a secondary thing but the bedrock of our beliefs, notions, and meanings. In the essay "Incidents of Mirror-Travel in the Yucatan," Smithson staged language or communicated graphically the Mayans' own close relationships to their deities. Interchanging deity and stone in the Mayan culture was the "taboo territory" Smithson traveled in his own Yucatin incidents ("FL," p. 102). It was a field of perception that, he suggested, if invoked one "really would be on troubled waters" ("FL," p. 102). More to the point, 71.

Ehrenzweig's notion of dedifferentiation defines an activity that oscillates between the psychic parameters-as defined by the object- relation branch of psychoanalysis-of the near oceanic level and the de- pressive position. Within the dedifferentiating activity is a repressive mechanism, a "dynamic process by which the ego scatters [projects] and represses [contains] surface imagery.'"73 Dedifferentiation carries out "the superego's demand for repression" but, Ehrenzweig was quick to add, it's also an activity that "prepares the way for the later re-introjection into consciousness" (HO, p. 218). Ehrenzweig contended that "in normal cre- ativity, containment ... of the scattered material leads to integration and re-introjection into the self." "Internal tension and conflict [ambivalence] is tolerated and built up" (HO, pp. 215, 218). In order to understand how the unconscious memory of experienced ambivalence took shape, Ehrenzweig suggested one should search for low-level sensibilities-a type of "undifferentiated unconscious scanning" that occurs prior to the formation of psychic gestalts (HO, p. 17). Smithson's art performed that task; for example, a Non-Site "allows for a kind of abstract consciousness" that sets up a way of dealing with "raw material and mental experience.. . where the gestalt becomes some- thing else" ("FC," pp. 96-97). According to Ehrenzweig, it was the screen- ing over of the unconscious process of scanning that allowed gestalts not only to take shape but to take hold of one's perceptions. Smithson's use of Ehrenzweig's theory-that abstract gestalts are the end products of drawn-out perceptual activity-surfaced early in his career. His second one-person show was "a deliberate scrubbing of the whole gestalt idea" ("FC," p. 111). To distance himself from the claims of his fellow artists who defined gestalt formations in terms of an immediacy of perception, he would subsequently structure a set of infrasystems to redifferentiate his "scanning" of numerous societal gestalts: the disciplinary assumptions of perspectival systems, the Hayden Planetarium, the surface terrain of an abandoned quarry site, and, into the 1970s, the role of parks. Smithson drew an analogy between Ehrenzweig's psychoanalytic no- tions of the scattered and the contained and the aesthetic notions of the romantic and the classical; the beautiful and the recognition of limits were the place of differentiation and the sublime was part of the place of near undifferentiation. Smithson posited that the tension between these two aesthetic poles "essentially manifests itself in fascinating art" ("FC," p. 97). 73. Anton Ehrenzweig, The Hidden Order ofArt: A Study in the Psychology ofArtistic Imagina- tion (Berkeley, 1967), p. 19; hereafter abbreviated HO.</page><page sequence="29">Critical Inquiry Spring 1994 447 Although Smithson felt one could never resolve such tension except through speculation, he could continue to locate the "contingency within containment." Throughout the 1960s, Smithson argued for a type of art that would "consolidate the scattering while heightening the loss of focus" ("FC," p. 113). The ambivalent relationship that Smithson set up in his art-for example, his way of scanning a particular terrain, then containing the scattering into a Non-Site-staged Ehrenzweig's mapping of the dediffer- entiated unconscious activity of scanning fragmented concrete reality. A Non-Site was "the abstract equivalent of the site" ("FC," p. 97). The pros- pected sites (deferred to in his Non-Sites) were not meant to be precisely locatable (manifest), emphasizing that condition Smithson consistently looked for: "homogeneous material that, in a sense, covers the vicinity of the site" ("FC," p. 112). Nonetheless, the ensembles Smithson called Non- Sites were not constructed to bar forever one's access to the prospected sites but to have those referenced sites dedifferentiated from their gen- eral surrounding vicinities. As Ehrenzweig stated, "Syncretistic vision [or the prospected sites referenced in Smithson's Non-Sites]. . . . impresses us as empty, vague and generalized only because the narrowly focused sur- face consciousness cannot grasp its wider more comprehensive structure. Its precise concrete content has become inaccessible and 'unconscious'" (HO, pp. 19-20). The near lack of differentiation between the prospected site and the general surrounding vicinity of the Non-Sites allowed for an aesthetic experience that reenacted "how your consciousness focuses" ("FC," p. 100) in the "extreme oceanic depth" of dedifferentiation, an experience that would stimulate an ambivalence of "manic bliss . .. mixed with a sense of deep mourning" (HO, pp. 212, 213). In part, Smithson's art leaned toward what he called the incommen- surable. And he often used Beckett's notion of the surd to define that place "where logic is suspended." It is not beyond logic because "there's no beyond.... There's no commensurable relation, or it's incommensu- rable" ("FC," p. 97). He felt the "rational critic of art cannot risk" entering this place because the critic was able only to "deal with the limits that come after this plunge into such a world of non-containment" ("SM," p. 84). This formula has since been attached to Barthes's use of the psycho- analytic notion of jouissance-a form of desire that is somehow able to break from its disciplining environment, that is, able to get beyond the controls of conventions.74 Smithson's use of Ehrenzweig's analysis has also been sublimated through Francois Lyotard's postmodern sublime-a conceptual version of the Barthesian jouissance but without the latter's 74. For Barthes's version ofjouissance and the Smithson connection, see Marjorie Per- loff, "Deus ex Machina: Some Futurist Legacies," The Futurist Moment: Avant-Garde, Avant Guerre, and the Language of Rupture (Chicago, 1986), pp. 194-238.</page><page sequence="30">448 Ron Graziani Smithson's Picturable Situation psychoanalytic base.75 But Smithson quickly added that to argue this space as a place where logic "becomes your own" was "a cheap kind of logic" ("FC," p. 97). The issue here is whether Smithson would have sub- scribed to a deus ex machina in the form of eros (jouissance) free in our garden of social constraint. The effect of Smithson's scanning and containing processes have been inscribed within Lyotard's postmodern sublime and Barthes's for- mula ofjouissance, but the results substantively differ from Ehrenzweig's manic oceanic.76 Both Ehrenzweig and Barthes celebrated the sense, but the former did so in order to generate a kind of wholeness, even if neces- sarily contingent and temporary, whereas Barthes celebrated a type of de-Marcusian polymorphous perverse nonidentity. Barthes's form of transgression also lacks any persecutory effects, avoiding the depressive mechanism operative in Ehrenzweig's manic position. No doubt both Eh- renzweig's structure and Barthes's method lean toward each other's views-and Smithson used both discourses-but Smithson's position was never merely blissful transgression (jouissance) but a manic form of con- solidating various forms of scatterings, while maintaining the contingent reality of that consolidation. This is an ambivalent position more attuned to Ehrenzweig's arguments. Smithson's art avoids thejouissance of the oce- anic, which Ehrenzweig defined as a nonplace where there is complete envelopment, where distance or the "other" is annihilated altogether, what Ehrenzweig called the "unconscious integration on an undifferenti- ated manic level" (HO, p. 119). Smithson's infrastructures contained an experience with the physical world, an encounter that reenacted Ehrenz- weig's dedifferentiated psychic position. And the raw physicality of that experience (even if its sites were in ruin) was a necessary aspect of Smith- son's art. Without the presence of the raw or geological site, Smithson's pictur- able situation becomes somewhat equivalent to a later version (in the late 1970s) that the Octoberist camp promoted though a group of artists known as the picturists. In 1977, Douglas Crimp helped to pinpoint those soon-to-be postmodern allegorical artists who "staged" their art as "pic- tures" where meaning is made contingent upon a specific intertextual relationship. Crimp defined this art through the Derridian notions of 75. For the use of Lyotard's postmodern sublime in explaining Smithson's art, see Sayre, The Object of Performance. The Octoberists have relied on Lyotard's postmodern con- ceptualization of the sublime in their attack on the Enlightenment agenda. 76. I would not want imply that there was no relationship between the art by Smithson and, for example, Barthes's reading of a photo, its "trace of a cause," or the function of the photo caption. In an unpublished essay composed in 1969, Smithson discusses how "the deposits of writing [captions] affect the topographical features of photographs." What hap- pens when a photograph is "separated from its title or caption"? He writes, a photo "be- comes a map with tangled longitudes and dislocated latitudes. . . distances are measured in degrees of disorder" (Smithson, "Hidden Trails in Art," Robert Smithson Unearthed, p. 83). But even the title of this essay is a reference to Ehrenzweig's "The Hidden Order in Art."</page><page sequence="31">Critical Inquiry Spring 1994 449 doubling, tracing, and effacing. He argued, too, that this type of staging was a critique of the conventions of representation, defining for Crimp a postmodern sensibility that could prevent modernism from instituting a new humanism called pluralism. In concluding a 1979 essay, he defined this type of postmodernism as a "stratigraphic activity.... staging ... strata of representation .... [claiming that] underneath each picture is always another picture.""77 Crimp's image of a strata of representation more than echoes Smithson's own article "Strata: A Geophotographic Fic- tion" published in the 1972 issue of Aspen Review.78 Yet, left out of the Octoberists' later version of their picturist situation is any use for natural strata, except, as Krauss put it, "as a second term of which the first is a representation." 79 This rupturing of the picturesque equation reappears in Blasted Alle- gories (1987). Smithson's "A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jer- sey" stands as the only writing in the anthology pulled from the 1960s. In fact, ten years separates the original publication date of Smithson's article from the other pieces in this anthology. The museum's director, Marcia Tucker, who wrote the foreword to the book, defines this anthology as a collection of writings that are "open- ended" and supported by "allegory's density and layering of meaning." Within this overall framework, Tucker (continuing Owens's argument) delineates a set of structural characteristics-"fragmentation, transience, appropriation, deferral of meaning, impermanence, and collapsed tem- poral dimension"-80that unifies this particular group of writings and, as such, distinguishes them within (and more importantlyfrom) the so-called postmodern art market of pluralism. By 1987, these unifying characteristics brought together in Blasted Allegories had been subjected to a decade of critical analysis by the Octo- berists. The title Blasted Allegories defines a form of resistance. It avoids the classical representational use of allegory that merely substitutes a figurative sense for a literal sense to determine meaning. Blasted Allegories was a negation of all external references, a form of storytelling that in the words of Brian Wallis, the anthology's editor, avoids coherent closures, favoring "fragmentary, inconclusive, digressive" types of storytelling. In place of any notion of the original, "the [allegorists] accept an under- standing of language and stories as 'already written' and shaped by social 77.

This time, what is repressed is not only any use for the natural but the anthology's own immediate relationship to the picturesque, that is, trees blasted by light- ning in many a nineteenth-century picturesque-sublime landscape paint- ing. Smithson "grounded" that tradition in his series of tree stumps planted upside down in the landscape. For the Octoberist, nothing lies beneath codes, codes do not overlay the natural; as such, that which is beneath the surface of conventions cannot be used to critically participate in our society. For the Octoberists, the only significant path is one of resis- tance and that lies in exposing the codes themselves, that is, the codes chosen as useful in their promotion of an anti-aesthetics. But for Smith- son nature-as-landscapes were never only pictures or, for that matter, merely conceptualizations. Although Smithson spoke of and chose taboo territory for sites of aesthetic containment during the 1960s, he framed that activity within established societal parameters for art (including its economic motives).82 Nevertheless, by the early 1970s Smithson no longer saw his art from the 1960s as a useful activity, and he began to relocate his aesthetics even more directly in the social fabric. His art continued to rely on abandoned sites for s(p)oil but turned to the reclamation of those sites as an artistic enterprise-one that could presumably play an integral part in the way society structured its recreational relationship to the environment. That is, mining sites themselves became the terrain where Smithson's criticality might help determine the demands of a specific lifestyle and an ideology that necessarily pits industry against an image of the environment rich in minerals. What happened in the 1970s when Smithson attached his brand of critical participation directly to the competing polarities of a growing environmental concern and the economic desires of the mining industry-and the timing of that activity-is a story yet to be told. As Smithson argued, no matter how far you go "you are thrown back" to your point of origin ("FC," p. 101).83 My own tracking of the 81. Wallis, "Telling Stories: A Fictional Approach to Artists' Writings," in Blasted Allego- ries, p. xiv. 82. What has not been dealt with in this essay is how Smithson went about scanning various scientific and industrial disciplines in his containment of the picturesque-sublime. See Ron Graziani, "Robert Smithson: An Aesthetic Prospector in the Mining Industry," Art Criticism (Spring 1994). 83. This return to one's point of origin can also be pursued in terms of Smithson's familial background. Smithson's way of displaying the earth and the activities of mining under it has affinities with the work of his grandfather Charles Smithson, "the Englishman who did all the plaster ceilings" in the New York subways, the Metropolitan Museum, Mu- seum of Natural History, and "one hundred of the finest churches in the United States."

As Ehrenzweig (concurring with Freud) felt, the uncanny will "evoke a mixture of feelings, anxieties mixed with disgust" (HO, p. 217). If Ehrenzweig was right, this uncanniness also "reinforces the ego's ten- dencies" "to re-differentiate the body zones" (HO, p. 216), or, in other words, it would, one hopes, reinforce a tendency to recontain difference in today's aesthetic discourse.

Additionally, Smithson's relationship to the picturesque has affinities with his early preoccupation with being a naturalist or, as a child, planning the itinerary for various family vacations. Smithson also had an uncle who worked for the Ham- mond Map Company (many of whose maps Smithson used for his art) and also introduced Robert to the world of crystals.</page></plain_text>
