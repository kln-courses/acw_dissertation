Columbia University Press, New York. $12.50. x + 342 p.; ill.; subject index. 1965. Those neophytes in the world of computers who are contemplating more than a usual use of a com- puter system would do very well to include at least a portion of this book in their curriculum. Sterling and Pollack, at the time this volume was published, were, respectively, Director and Associate Director of the Medical Computing Center, College of Medi- cine, University of Cincinnati. They have since moved elsewhere to further work in the life sciences as recognized interdisciplinary experts. The book is divided into four parts of essentially independent content. The first part deals with basic concepts of the computer system structure without reference to any specific content of problems to be solved on the computer. As such, this part of the book might serve as a solid technical introduc. tion to the computer for a worker in any discipline. The material does not require much by way of tech- nical background for a profitable reading. In the four chapters of this part one gets a detailed ac- count of current systems and equipment being used in computer work The equipment described is a realistic sampling of the present state of the art and affords a pleasant relief from the all-to-prevalent descriptive material of antiquated computer equip- ment by other authors of "computer books." The authors use the word "robot" interchange- ably with "computer system" in their book, and go so far as to state that "Computers are really the souls or nervous systems of robots." This is a</page><page sequence="2">MARCH 1967] NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 103 rather common anthropomorphism which the au- thors have chosen to tise fairly literally. Such usage may distract the dissenting reader from some solid virtues of the book. Part Two of the book consists of four chapters which deal with statistical and modelling techniques which have been of frequent use in formulating life-science problems for solution by computer. While the analysis and programming techniques de- scribed in this part are of general applicability, the problems analyzed are specific to the life sciences. The authors emphasize a principle in this part which is of prime importance in the computing field: that the choice of statistic or model used in the analysis of a problem determines the validity of the result. The computer speeds of today make it possible to produce quickly a sad accumulation of millions of computations of perfect accuracy but of completely irrelevant content. The authors take pains to clarify proper usage of statistical methods by developing their discussion from an applications viewpoint. Part Three of the book deals in detail with well known and, by now, classical applications in radia- tion treatment planning, nuclear medicine, electro- ballistographics, and diagnostic aids. This part of the book can by no means by considered an encyclo- pedia of applications in the life sciences, although much source material is indicated in the bibliogra- phies of each chapter. The attempt here is rather to do a few illustrative applications in depth. Part Four of the book contains two chapters. The first chapter is a succinct summary of the most com- mon snares, pitfalls and cautions in establishing computing facilities. These remarks are gleanings from sad experience, and a tyro administrator in any new computer venture can gain from them. The final chapter, Implications for the Future, is also largely cautionary in nature. No rosy extrapola- tions are indulged in. This book is not a survey of computer applica- tions in the life sciences, but rather may serve as a basic text and guide for the novice in the computing field. DAVID A. LEVINE</page></plain_text>
