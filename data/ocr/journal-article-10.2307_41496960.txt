Hershkovitz and A. Gopher Abstract: Salvage excavations and surveys at Neve-Yam, a submerged Pottery-Neolithic (PN) Wadi Rabah settlement ( second half of the 8th millennium cal. BP) off the Carmel coast revealed unique stone-built graves. They were concentrated in a specific and separate section of the site devoted to burial and associated activities. There were no dwellings in this burial area and no graves were found in the occupation area. The oval graves, oriented in an east-west direction, were built of undressed stones and some were covered by stone slabs. This is an early example for a clear division between a dwelling zone and a burial ground with stone-built graves in a Neolithic settlement. Three concentrations of charred seeds in the burial area are possibly associated with ritual activities. The separation of the living from the dead in this late PN site is notably different from earlier PN and Pre- Pottery Neolithic (PPN) burial practices and should be considered in light of the later Chalcolithic Ghassulian (starting in middle 7th millennium cal. BP) appear- ance of formal off-site cemeteries. Résumé: Des fouilles de sauvetage et des observations de terrain à Neve-Yam, un village de la culture Wadi Rabah (Néolithique céramique, 2nde moitié du VIIIe millénaire cal. BP), submergé de la côte du Carmel, ont révélé des tombes en pierre aux caractéristiques particulières. Elles étaient concentrées dans un secteur spécifique du site, voué aux rituels funéraires. Il n'y avait pas d'habitations dans cette partie destinée aux inhumations, et aucune tombe n'a été trouvée dans la zone d'habitation. Les tombes ovales, orientées est-ouest, étaient construites avec des pierres brutes et certaines étaient recouvertes par des dalles de pierre. Il s'agit de l'un des plus anciens villages néolithiques connus, où la séparation est évidente entre la zone d'habitation et la zone funéraire dans laquelle se trouvaient les tombes en pierre. Trois concentrations de graines brûlées dans la zone funéraire peuvent être associées à des activités rituelles. La séparation entre les vivants et les morts dans ce site du Néolithique céramique présente des différences notables avec des pratiques funéraires du Néolithique céramique antérieur et du Néolithique pré- céramique. Elle annonce les pratiques funéraires qui seront observées lors de la période suivante, au Ghassulien ( Chale olithique) qui commence au milieu du VIIe millénaire cal. BP, pendant laquelle les cimetières seront à l'écart des établissements. Keywords: Israel; Pottery Neolithic; Submerged settlement; Carmel coast; Skeletal remains.

Formal cemeteries, on or off-site, are not found in the Late Prehistory of the Southern Levant before the Chalcolithic Ghassulian.1 No such Neolithic cemeteries were unearthed although recently it was suggested that some PPNB sites were 1.

G ALILI) THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF NEVE-YAM Neve-Yam is one of five submerged PN settlements along the Carmel coast linked to the Wadi Rabah culture. The other localities are Megadim, Tel-Hreize, Kfar-Galim, and Kfar- Samir (fig. 1). These sites are dated to the second half of the 8th millennium cal. BP.4 The site is located between the coastline and a submerged kurkar (aeolian sand stone) ridge (fig. 3) at a depth of 0-1.5 m below the present mean sea level (bsl). The archaeological remains are located in the upper layer of hard clay of terrestrial origin embedded in a trough between the coastal kurkar ridges which were formed during the Late Pleistocene. The remains are usually covered by a 1-2 m layer of quartz sand. A portion of the eastern section of the site (fig. 2:B) was first exposed in the swash zone during the late 1960's following a sea storm.5 During 1968 a small rescue excavation was carried out on the shore, in the central area of the site. During the years 1983-1995, sections of the 4. GALILI, 2004; GALILI et al., 1988, 1989, 1997, 1998 and 2002; GALIU and SCHICK, 1990; HORWITZ et al., 2002 and 2006; GREENFIELD et al., 2006. 5.

Underwater rescue surveys carried out by the Israel Antiquities Author- ity and Haifa University6 revealed stone-built graves and skel- etal remains buried in the clay, unpaved pits, paved surfaces, hearths, postholes, pottery vessels (fig. 4), flint and stone artifacts, and floral and faunal remains. In 2005, following a storm, a large section of the northern part of the site was exposed in the shallow sea (depth 0-1 m bsl). Foundations of rectangular structures and wall fragments ( ca 0.5 m in width) built of two rows of undressed kurkar stones were observed (fig. 5). Paved surfaces made of small uiidressed stones, stone slabs and pottery fragments were found as well. Flint, bone and stone artifacts and animal bones were collected as well as pottery vessels. 6.

Gali и et al Fig. 6 - Pottery sherd bearing engravings offish and herring bones. (Photo: T. SAGIV ; © Israel Antiquities Authority) The faunal remains indicate that the animal economy was based on domestic sheep, goat, cattle, and pig. The scarce remains of wild animals (gazelle, badger and maybe wild boar and wild sheep) attest to the minor role played by hunting in the settlement economy. About one-third of the cattle and sheep/ goats were adults that were probably maintained for breeding purposes. The kill-off patterns, namely slaughtering juvenile males, indicate that the management of cattle, sheep/goats and probably also pigs was aimed at meat procurement.7 The remarkably well preserved bones enabled the identification of cut marks and a reconstruction of butchery-related activities on 6-8% of the sheep/goat bones and 18% of the gazelle bones.8 The bone processing analysis indicates that the full range of butchery-related activities (slaughter, disarticulation, filleting and skinning) were conducted on-site and suggests that whole carcasses were butchered and consumed on-site. The fish remains from Neve-Yam and from other submerged PN settle- ments off the Carmel coast are relatively scarce (22 bones in Neve-Yam),9 compared to the far greater number (3,842 bones) found in the earlier, PPNC site of Atlit-Yam.10 This may indi- cate that the role of fishing in these coastal PN communities was limited. The flint tools are characteristic of Late Neolithic assem- blages. There are truncated rectangular sickle blades, adzes, chisels and axes with polished working edges and other tools made on flakes. Bone tools include mainly awls (points). The groundstone tool assemblage consists of basalt grind- ing stones, pedestaled bowls, bowls and a few mace heads. 7. HORWITZ et al., 2006. 8. Greenfield et al ., 2006. 9. HORWITZ et al., 2002 and 2006. 10. CALILI étal., 2004. Anthropomorphic stone figures were also found. The ceramic assemblage includes carinated bowls, flower-pot (straight walled) bowls, bowls with concave sides, kraters, spouted ves- sels, holemouth jars, bow-rim jars and pithoi with thickened rims. Some vessels have lug handles. Many of the sherds were black or dark red slipped and some were painted with bands along the rims. Characteristic Wadi Rabah decorations include punctuated and combed designs, and wide herringbones motifs as well as rope-like design. A unique sherd bearing an incised depiction of two fish with an internal herringbone pattern was also found (fig. 6). The site was dated by three 14C dates to the second half of the 8th millennium cal. BP (table 1). According to the dates and the archaeological assemblages, the site was attributed to the PN Wadi Rabah culture11 as defined by J. Kaplan,12 A. Gopher and R. Gophna,13 and A. Gopher.14 Scarce remains attributed to the PN Lodian culture (as defined by A. Gopher and R. Gophna15, A. Gopher,16 and A. Gopher and N. Block- man17) were recovered some 200 m north of the site (fig. 2:C). These include several pottery fragments, flint artifacts and some fragments of a human skull and ribs. METHODOLOGY UNDERWATER EXCAVATION Studying a submerged Prehistoric site in the inter-tidal and the surf zones on an open coast requires special techniques and skills. The site is too shallow to apply the underwater excavation methods developed for Atlit-Yam.18 Land excava- tion methods are not useful. Waves interfere with the exca- vation and the visibility is poor. The exposure of the site is incidental, unpredictable and cannot be preplanned. The site is partially exposed randomly every 5 to 15 years. The exposure may last a few hours to a few days and then the site is again covered by sand. During the exposure, the site erodes and the artifacts are shifted about. Usually the site is covered by 1-2 m of sand. Removing the sand for excavation is complicated and extremely expensive. It requires the use of heavy dredging and 11. CALILI et al., 1998; GÁLILI, 2004. 12. KAPLAN, 1958. 13. GOPHER and GOPHJSfA, 1993. 14. GOPHER, 1995. 15. Gopher and Gophna, 1993. 16. Gopher, 1995. 17.

Thus an alternative exca- vation method was developed: "Let the sea do the job." The site was surveyed after every storm to locate newly exposed areas. When an exposure occurred, a rapid salvage operation of excavation and documentation was carried out by diving archaeologists. The loose sand that covered the delicate finds was removed by manual fanning. As a result, after scores of years, a jig saw puzzle of randomly documented sections of the site became available. Human skeletons were excavated manu- ally. After exposure, the skeletons were measured, drawn and photographed. Bones were then taken ashore, soaked in fresh water and underwent a series of conservation treatments before storage. STUDYING THE SKELETAL REMAINS The Estimated Number of Individuals (ENI),19 sex and age distributions (when possible), are summarized in table 2. The burials were classified according to the following tentative 19. The Minimum Number of Individuals value (MNI) is calculated accord- ing to the highest available number of the same type of bone found in the site. Post deposition processes in Prehistoric sites resulted in the loss of many skeletal elements, thus the MNI usually represents a considerably low number of individuals compared to the number deposited in the site. The Estimated Number of Individuals (ENI) is calculated by referring to the skeletal material found in the site while considering the archaeologi- cal context. ENI includes: 1. the greatest number of the same age-range related diagnostic and indicative bones at the site; 2. all individuals that were recovered from an intentional burials; 3. isolated post-cranial bones or skulls that do not belong to the in situ burials and are not already represented in the sample. The ENI (also named Maximum Number of Individual, max. N1) is thus larger than the MNI and provides a more realistic estimation of the skeletal population. categories which were also used to classify the Atlit-Yam burials20 (table 3): 1. Primary burials - skeletons in complete articulation showing no signs of removal from the origi- nal burial locations. This category also includes skeletons in partial articulation that were disturbed in Antiquity or were disturbed by post-depositional processes; 2. Secondary buri- als - bones of individuals that were deliberately removed in Antiquity from the original grave to a new location; 3. Skull or skull parts found without post-cranial bones, and it is not clear if they were deliberately placed there by the inhabit- ants or washed from eroded graves; 4. Isolated bone(s) - scat- tered randomly on-site, most probably originating from eroded burials. SITE PLAN AND THE BURIAL GROUND Based on our excavations, the site of Neve-Yam can be divided into two main sections (fig. 2): • The southern section - a burial ground (fig. 2: A) consist- ing mainly of stone-built and pit graves, hearths with carbonized material and some, partly burnt mud bricks, small (0.5-1 m2) paved surfaces, postholes and small round unpaved pits. • The northern section - the dwelling area (fig. 2:B) con- sisting mainly of foundations of straight walls and rectangular structures. 20.

THE BURIAL GROUND Altogether ten graves were located.21 Eight of them are stone-built, and only four of them were excavated (the remain- ing four were identified as graves by their architecture). The skeletal assemblage consists of 15 individuals. Six were in pri- 21. One "pit grave" was found in the northern (Lodian) section of Neve-Yam (Area C), which is not relevant to this study. тагу burials and the rest were disturbed or secondary burials of types 3, 4 outlined above. Various pits, hearths, small paved sur- faces, faunal and floral remains, and tools that may have been associated with the burials were identified in the burial area. All ten graves were concentrated in the southern part of the Wadi Rabah site within what seems to be a well defined burial area (Area A) (fig. 7). Of the graves, two are "covered box graves" - an oval, stone-built grave made of undressed stones and covered by a few elongated undressed slabs (fig. 8, Paléorient, vol. 35.1, p. 31-46 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2009 Table 2 - Age and sex distribution of the human remains. Articulated individuals are presented in bold.</page><page sequence="7">Evidence for a Separate Burial Ground 37 table 3), four are "uncovered box graves" - a rectangular or oval grave, built of undressed stones placed around the skel- eton, two are "stone graves" - a few stones inserted in the clay above the skeleton, and two are "pit graves" - a pit in the clay without any grave structure or stones. It is possible that the "uncovered box graves" and the "stone graves" are eroded cov- ered box graves. Of the six excavated graves, two were of the "uncovered box grave" type, two were of the "stone grave" type and two were "pit graves". The other stone-built graves were covered by a thick layer of sand soon after exposure and thus could not be excavated. Six skeletons in articulation (primary or partly disturbed burials of type 1) were recovered from the graves, four of these were from the "stone-built graves" and two were from the "pit graves". Additionally nine fragments of post-cranial bones and a skull were recovered from this area (table 3). GRAVE LOCATION AND ORIENTATION The ten Wadi Rabah graves were found in an area covering some 40 X 70 m in the southern section (Area A) of the site. Most of these (nine of ten) were concentrated in a relatively small area (30 x 25 m) (fig. 7). Grave H6, which contained a 3-4-year old child and some cranial bones of an adult female, was in the northern edge of this area, close (3 m distance) to the occupation zone (figs. 2 and 7).

The ori- entation of "pit grave" H15 cannot be determined. All the graves are in open spaces and are not associated with struc- tures or walls. Two paved areas (ca 1 x 0.5 m each) made of flat stones were exposed near Grave H7. Of the scattered bones (burial types 3, 4) associated with the Wadi Rabah section of the site, six were recovered in Area A, and one (H14) was in the northern edge of the burial area (figs. 2: A and 6, table 3). The content of the "covered box graves" is unknown (figs. 7:119-120 and 8) since they were not excavated. Two of the "uncovered box graves" (fig. 7:H4 and H6) contained the remains of three individuals (H4, H6A, and H6B). Two "stone graves" contained the remains of two individuals (fig. 9:H3 and H5; fig. 10 above). H7, an infant less than half a year old found with a few pottery sherds, and H 15, a toddler aged 2-3 years were buried in "pit graves". THE HUMAN SKELETAL REMAINS The sample consisted of 15 individuals (tables 2-3): eight children (aged 0-10 years), one adolescent (10-18 years), and six adults. The adults included three females, one male and two individuals of unknown sex (each represented by only one bone). The 13 sexed and/or aged individuals are pre- sented in figure 11 (0-10 years in 5-year cohorts and &gt;10 in 10-year cohorts). Although the number of individuals is small, the mortality profile for the Neve-Yam population is typical of those seen in Prehistoric archaeological cemeteries.22 There is high child mortality (0-10 years), especially in early child- hood (0-5 years: 38.4%), and relatively high in later childhood (5-10 years: 23.0%). After this age, the mortality decreases in the adolescent cohorts (10-20 years: 7.6%) and rises again in the young adult age (20-30 years: 15.3%), represented by the two females. For the two following age cohorts (30-40 and &gt;40: 7.6%) the mortality rates decrease. Thus it can be gener- ally stated that all age groups are represented and the majority of the individuals found are infants and children. BURIAL TYPES, POSITIONS AND ORIENTATION Of all skeletal remains found on-site, six individuals were buried in primary burials (type 1; figs. 9-10, table 3) and nine were represented by unarticulated bones (types 3, 4). No 22. WEISS, 1973. Fig. 10 - Above: Skeleton H5 buried in flexed position on its left side. Bottom: The upper part of skeleton H5 in detail. (Photo: E.

ESHED) secondary burials were found on-site. Of the six primary buri- als, five were lying on their left side and the position of the other one (H15) could not be determined. The skulls of three skeletons (H3, H4, and H5) were directed to the west and the skulls of two skeletons to the south (the adult H6B and the H7 infant). Four skeletons were buried in fully flexed position. In four skeletons (H3, H4, H5, and H6) the elbows were flexed 90° and the rest of the joints were fully flexed (figs. 9-10).23 No charred bones or group burials were found at the site, with the exception of one charred skull calvaria recovered together with H6 (within the grave). OFFERINGS No grave goods were recovered inside the excavated graves. However, three concentrations of charred seeds that may be associated with the burials were recovered in Area A, rela- tively close to the graves (fig. 7). These included Lentil seeds (figs. 7:6 and 12): about 300 cc of seeds mixed with clay, all domesticated (. Lens culinaris var. microsperma ) were found ca 17 m east of the burials. The seeds varied in size and some were infested by pest beetles, probably identifiable as Bru- chus sp. Another deposit of barley grains (figs. 7:9 and 12) contained about 100 cc of grain seeds of various shapes and sizes, mixed with clay and concentrated in a hearth built of burnt mud bricks, situated ca 15 m of from the burials. About 90% of the grains were of domesticated barley ( Hordeum sati- vum = H. vulgare). Additionally, this seed assemblage included a few seeds of cultivated and wild plants such as domesticated emmer ( Triticum dicoccum), domesticated lentils, one seed of Vicieae, a few seeds of Liliaceae, and some unidentified 23. See also GALILI et al ., 2005. Fig. 12 - Charred grains of pulses (apparently domesticated). (Photo: E. GALILI) seeds. A third cluster of about 300 cc of seeds without clay (figs. 7:39 and 12) was found ca 1.5 m east of burial H3. This sample consisted mainly of several species of pulses (appar- ently domesticated) including (by frequency): pea or a kind of horse been ( Pisum sativum or Vicia narbonensis), vetch- ling ( Lathyrus sect. Cicércula ), horse bean ( Vicia faba var. minor), lentil, domesticated flax ( Linum usitatissimum ), and a few wild plants or weeds ( Galium , Lolium and Lilicaeae). DISCUSSION The burials of Neve-Yam are separated from the living quarters and concentrated in a small area of ca 700 m2. This area is free of buildings, but has hearths, stone pavements, pavements made of pottery sherds, plastered installations, and post holes. Architecturally, it differs greatly from the central section of the site (Area B), where built walls are common (fig. 5). 24 Such a spatially discrete area containing a concentra- tion of stone-built graves beside a dwelling area is unknown at present in other PN sites in the Southern Levant. Signifi- cantly, in the later Chalcolithic Ghassulian culture (starting in the middle of the 6th millennium cal. BP), separated, off-site cemeteries are well known.25 The age at death structure of the people buried in Neve- Yam is comparable with what is expected from other archaeo- logical cemeteries. The mortality profile shows high mortality for infants and children 1-5 years old, which is not surprising. Such high mortality rates, mainly in the first year of life, are expected among ancient hunter-gatherers and agricultural pop- 24. e.g., GALILI, 2004. 25. LEVY, 1995. Paléorient, vol. 35.1, p. 31-46 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2009</page><page sequence="11">Evidence for a Separate Burial Ground 41 illations.26 These high rates due to endogenous and exogenous factors are associated with the development of the immuno- logical system and with the response capacities of children to environmental stress (such as infections, parasites and gas- trointestinal disorders). After age 5, children's mortality rate slows down, as they become less vulnerable. Often, in ancient skeletal populations, infants are under-represented due to dif- ferential preservation (taphonomic processes) or funerary rites. It is important to note that at Neve-Yam, children including infants (newborn up to the age of one year) were proportion- ally represented. This may imply that children, regardless of their age, were treated as group members. Also, the sex ratio is within the expected range. The three charred seed assemblages found in the vicin- ity of the graves and the nearby installations (hearths, post- holes, pits) may be related to rites associated with the dead. Since these seeds were not found in the graves, it seems that they were not intended to "feed" the dead. Rather, they may be related to ritual consumption or ceremonial meals near the graves during the burial or on special occasions after burial. Also, many animal bones27 that may have been consumed in similar circumstances were recovered from the same area. Bringing offerings of livestock and cultivated crops was com- mon among later Near Eastern cultures. Bringing the first harvest to the temple was commanded in the Bible {Exodus 34:26; 23:19). Moreover, mourning prac- tices involving the symbolic consumption of vegetables is also mentioned in later Jewish Talmudic sources (Baba-Batra 16b): "after Abraham's death, Jacob prepared lentil porridge to comfort his father Isaac for the death of his father." The Neve- Yam Neolithic burial ground may represent an early example of such activity signifying an association between the dead, the living, food, eating and offering the harvest (and possibly livestock too) to the ancestors or gods. The well defined, pos- sibly preplanned burial ground was probably designed for such activities as part of the settlement. The presence of weeds and wild plants in the seed assem- blages as well as the chronology of the site seem to indicate that the grains were harvested in cultivated fields. The bar- ley and the pulses are harvested in the spring, while wheat is usually harvested in early summer. The fact that barley is the dominant cereal in these assemblages may be of signifi- cance and could be indicative of a spring event. Spring is viewed as a season of rebirth, abundance and recreation in many societies. 26. ALESAN et al., 1999. 27. HORWITZ et al, 2006. COMPARANDA Pottery Neolithic burial practices in the Southern Levant are generally not very well known. Some information is avail- able on the Yarmukian and Lodian burials.28 Later PN Wadi Rabah burials are a little better known. Three adults with intact skulls were found under a house floor at Ein el-Jarba.29 An adult buried in a shallow pit was found at Nahal Beset I, in the upper Galilee. The skull was missing and no grave goods were found.30 A burial of an adult from Kefar Gil'adi in the upper Galilee31 cannot be clearly attributed to the Wadi Rabah culture but it falls within the same general time-range. A few Wadi Rabah burials in small pits were reported from Ha- Gosherim layer IV;32 two burials, an adolescent and a baby (in a jar) were exposed in Teluliyot Batashi layer III.33 Additional Wadi Rabah skeletal remains include infants and fetuses jar burials from Tel Dan34 and Tel Te'o.35 At Nahal Zehora II, a Wadi Rabah jar burial was found, as well as an infant buried in a miniature stone cist. Noteworthy are the Qatifian jar burial from Qatif Y-3,36 and a possible jar burial of a newborn men- tioned by Z. Kafafi37 in the lower levels of Tell Abu Hamid. Of interest here are burials in stone-built cist-like instal- lations in the early PN (NA) of Byblos38 and the Sha'ar Hago- lan cairn may be mentioned here too.39 The idea of box-like stone-built graves, may thus have been as early as the begin- ning of the PN (Yarmukian). In this context, a few stone-built cist graves found in the PN site of Tabaqat al-Buma in Jordan are relevant. They were built of and covered by stone slabs and contained grave offerings.40 The Tabaqat al-Buma cist graves include two clear Wadi Rabah ("phase 2") cist grave as well as two additional, larger, cist graves that are stratigraphically ear- lier ("phase 1") and be related to an earlier PN entity, as noted by the excavators.41 Following the material culture aspects 28.

Nevertheless, while the early two cist graves preceded all PN building on-site, the later Wadi Rabah burials in Tabaqat al-Bûma are between dwellings within the residential area. Also, the burials there display a variety of forms: for example, a child burial in a clay-lined storage bin and another burial in a converted stone silo.42 An important addition to this discussion might be the 'megalithic' stone cist graves from Natzur 4 post-Wadi Rabah, pre-Ghassulian site in the coastal plain of Israel.43 Stone-built graves were also found in the Negev Highlands at Ramat Sha- ronim44 and in the Southern Negev at Eilat.45 Both of these sites cannot be considered classical manifestations of a PN entity, as known in the Mediterranean regions, and they seem to be desert sites reflecting aspects of societies contemporaneous with the later parts of the PN in the North but practicing a different way of life that possibly focused on herding. It is notable, in this context, that 'jar burials', well-known in the PN of the region and especially in Wadi Rabah contexts,46 were not found at Neve-Yam. However, the case of the infant burial (H7) accompanied by pottery sherds could represent a dam- aged jar burial. The PN burial data, and especially that of Neve-Yam, may thus be seen in a wider regional Neolithic/Chalcolithic context of burial customs and the evolution of separate burial grounds and later off-site formal cemeteries. Pre-Pottery Neolithic burials are usually on-site and in many cases within buildings or associated with them - i.e., intramural or within the living quarters of the site.47 A recent interpretation suggested that the PPNB site of Kfar HaHoresh could be interpreted as a common grave site of local farming communities and that some ritual activities were performed there.48 In a more general statement, it was explicitly suggested that "separate cemetery sites remain to be located and iden- tified as such"49 - that is, that some Neolithic sites (in this case of the PPNB) should or could be seen as actual off-site cemeteries. An interesting case here is the PPNB of Tel Aswad in the Damascus basin.50 The excavators point out a burial 42. BANNING et al, 1989 and 1992; BANNING, 1995. 43. YANNAI, 2001. 44.

On-site burials within the dwelling area continued to be the case in many PPNB sites and contin- ued into the PPNC as indicated in cases such as 'Ain Ghazal51 and Atlit-Yam. It is of note that at PPNC Atlit-Yam, 45 out of the 63 burials on-site are concentrated in the Northwest section of the site (Areas К and L) and 23 of these 45 burials are adjacent to or within a single rectangular dwelling struc- ture no. 60.52 We may thus conclude that while the PPNC Atlit- Yam burials resemble the burials of other PPN sites, it is appar- ent that there was a tendency to concentrate the burials in a certain section associated with hearths and megalithic stone features. In PN Neve-Yam which is ca 1,200 years later than Atlit- Yam, the burials may indicate another stage of separation between the living and the dead. They were concentrated in a specific, separate section of the site devoted to burials and associated activities. Neve-Yam is an early example of a Neolithic settlement clearly dividing the occupation zone with rectangular houses from an area with stone-built graves for the dead. The dead now had their own quarter and their own individual "houses" as represented by the stone built graves. During the Chalcolithic period, off-site and well defined formalized cemeteries containing stone-built graves and ossu- aries (made of stone or clay and imitating houses) are a com- mon feature in the Southern Levant.53 The Neve-Yam and these Chalcolithic burial sites may be considered as the earliest evi- dence of established, institutionalized cemeteries that became the major burial tradition for years to come in the region. CONCLUSIONS The PN site of Neve-Yam shows a clear organizational pattern in which the dwellings and the burials are separated. That is, burials are concentrated in an area with no dwell- ings, while in the occupation area there are no burials. The only exception from this clearly emerging pattern is burial H6 located between the burial area (Area A) and the dwellings area (Area B). Neve-Yam thus provides early evidence for an exclusive, separate burial area with stone-built graves and accompanying activities. The presence of graves built of large 51.

Stone-built cists are a clear change from PPN burial traditions and may have started already at the very beginning of the PN (see above, comments on Byblos and Tabaqat al-Bûma). However in Neve- Yam they first appear in an organized burial ground separated from the occupation area. The agricultural products that may be offering or remains of ritual meals next to the graves may reflect the later developed and well-known practices of bring- ing part of the harvest and herd to the ancestors (and gods) as reflected in regional myths and biblical sources. The separated burial ground can be seen, in a symbolic way, as a separation of the dead and the living. This may reflect a changing social organization, or a change in the structure of political power. Although the dead were still close and still on- site, they were excluded from the areas of daily village activi- ties and may be also separated from the conflicts of the living.
