<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES POLITICAL THEORY, HISTORY OF POLITICAL THOUGHT, AND METHODOLOGY The Power Structure: Political Process in Amer- can Society. By ARNOLD M. ROSE. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1967. Pp. 506. $8.50.) Who Rules America? BY G. WILLIAM DOMHOFF. (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1967. Pp. 184. $4.95.) The Emergent American Society. By LLOYD WAR- NER, ET AL. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1967. Pp. 667 $15.00.) All three of these books are best read and re- garded not as the efforts in social science they purport to be but rather as expressions of political ideology. To be sure, each bears respectable meth- odological hallmarks and all present the fruits of impressive empirical homework. Still and all, it is abundantly clear that in each case the authors had their conclusions well in mind before they began to search for materials that would support their points of view. All writing on a subject such as power is bound to be ideological in that an author's selection- and omission-of illustrations and emphases will inevitably reflect his personal judgments about the quality of the society he is purporting to depict. To be sure, it usually remains for the reader to lo- cate these moral premises: part of the fun of the game stems from the fact that certain cards are always kept face down. Arnold Rose, who died shortly after completing his book, sets out to rebut and refute C. Wright Mills and Floyd Hunter. This is not really very difficult once you decide to depict the Mills- Hunter position as a simple-minded monolithism. It is ironic how much academic energy has been expended attempting to lay to rest these two stimulating but hardly research-worthy tracts. Nevertheless, to coin a paraphrase, it takes an ideologue to catch an ideologue. Rose's unstated opinion is that the United States is a pretty good place by any objective or comparative standard: the society is pluralistic, power is dispersed, and political influence is diffused throughout a vigor- ous population. In short, not much is wrong with the way things are. This position-not at all un-</page><page sequence="2">1302 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 62 common among political scientists-combines ele- ments of liberalism and conservatism. That is to say, it supports a New Deal conception of the good society-more or less, a Hubert Humphrey view-with a liberal government in an essentially capitalist culture. However such an outlook is nec- essarily conservative if only because it has so much to defend. New Dealers are compelled to justify the existing contours of American politics and society, for that structure is in large measure a product of the policies to which they have long been committed. To suggest that almost three de- cades of this kind of government has still left the nation in a seriously unsatisfactory state would be to condemn one's own handiwork. Thus The Power Structure is, in these terms, an apologia for the America in which we now live. The status-quo is defined as democracy; and democracy is seen as suffusing the status-quo. It is instructive that an author of Rose's disposition saw fit to invest so much time and effort in attacking critics on his ideological left; yet it is understandable that he do so, as they are claiming that all his successes were in fact failures. Professor Domhoff, in contrast, is a young man with no commitments to the policies or programs of the past. His mercifully slender volume pur- ports to show than an intertwined circle-he pre- fers to call it a "class"-presides over the major instruments of power in American life. The book names names, draws lines of relationships, and concludes that a small and concerted group in fact rules America. Quite plainly, Domhoff considers that United States to be a most undemocratic and inequalitarian society; by his moral measure it is a hypocritical and decadent culture direly in need of thoroughgoing reform. However while he draws on and has much sympathy with the thinking of C. Wright Mills, Domhoff wears at least one of Rose's ideological blinders. For all his radicalism, he is temperamentally too much in the American grain to acknowledge that the power structure he is examining remains essentially capitalist in char- acter. Hence his elaborate preoccupation with the people in high places, but hardly any attention to the institutional complexes which provide the chairs in which they sit. My own judgment is that Rose's description of power in our national life is a very partial picture, having selected for empirical analysis only those areas where in fact a relatively broad and diversi- fied series of publics participates in the making of policy. (No one, not even Paul Sweezy, has ever suggested that PTA's are puppets of a ruling class.) But Domhoff's assiduous mining of the So- cial Registers never comes to grips with the fact that the United States is a system built on private ownership, advanced technology, and a govern- ment which must necessarily expend most of its efforts reacting to conditions not of its own mak- ing. His problem is that he has no coherent con- ception of the macro-structure which elevates all the board-room types he enumerates. I am not suggesting that the answer is somewhere in Vol- ume IV of Capital; however I would assert that until Domhoff and others like him begin to look at American power in its capitalist context, they will only be charting effects rather than causes. (Let me add that those of Rose's persuasion are convinced that capitalism disappeared between the break-up of the old Standard Oil Company in 1912 and the inauguration of Social Security in 1935. They have such an intellectual vested inter- est in the assumed irrelevance of Marx that it is too much to ask them to rethink their conclusions about that mode of perception.) Finally, Warner's non-book-and a $15.00 non- book at that. The formula is of course familiar. First persuade yourself that you are qualified to delve into a very significant subject; next con- vince a foundation that you are the man to pre- side over a research project that will produce the definitive statement for our generation; and then proceed to spend lots and lots of money gathering lots and lots of facts. Here we are presented with fifteen chapters, by different authors, on churches and corporations, unions and universities, trade as- sociations and government agencies. Literally thousands of questionnaires were sent out and their replies sedulously recorded. Some of the facts are quite intriguing. (For example, most reli- gious associations have governing bodies with 50 or more members whereas most groups devoted to the advancement of education are presided over by boards having less than 20 members.) But the general conclusion is a non-conclusion: large and complex organizations in contemporary American society are large and complex. On first glance, it would seem that Warner and his colleagues are not infected with an ideological glaze. After all, no conclusion should be a sign of no ideology. But further scrutiny reveals that what we have here is not simply knowledge that has been produced by mechanical means: more important, the very sub- stance of that knowledge has been shaped by the machines it has employed. Ideology is basically a manner of perceiving reality, and here the distort- ing lens is inherent in the method; for the Warner volume assumes that only information which can be secured by certain mechanical means is entitled to be regarded as reportable knowledge. Needless to say, this limits one's purview. With all deference to Karl Mannheim, I do not believe that scholars can somehow raise them- selves above the ideological smog which infects the senses of lesser men. But I do believe that we can do a lot more to understand the scope of our pre- conceptions and the limits they impose on our</page><page sequence="3">1968 BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES 1303 perceptions. I also have a hunch that if we were not so cautious about soiling our career credentials we might even preface our books by acknowledg- ing our biases about the good, the true, and the beautiful. Certainly to continue to claim that we can immunize our writing from ideology is pre- tentious nonsense.-ANDREW HACKER, Cornell Uni- versity. Political Philosophy and Time. BY JOHN G. GUN- NELL. (Middletown: Wesleyan University Press, 1968. Pp. 314. $10.00.) Plato's capacity to elicit writing of the highest quality from his commentators is instanced once more by Prof. Gunnell's Political Philosophy and Time. It is one of the wonders of intellectual his- tory that given talent and sympathy, a scholar can be raised almost above himself by the force and beauty of Plato's dialogues. They infect the studious admirer with some measure of their own excellence: they insist that a man be at his abso- lute best when he responds to them, and they in- sensibly, mimetically, impart inspiration to him. Aside from Rousseau and Burke, it would be hard to think of any other political theorist who pos- sesses this power of enchantment to nearly the same degree. Naturally, agreement or disagree- ment with Plato (or Rousseau or Burke) is not in question. Rather, it is a matter of honoring with attention imaginative genius wherever it appears. Gunnell's book is the fruit of such devotion. His thesis is that ". . . political philosophy was at its inception, that is, with Plato, a reconstruc- tion, on the level of conscious thought, of the vi- sion of political order as a mediating space, a me- socosm, which would assimilate man to or inte- grate him with that which is most eternal and overcome historical existence, which in terms of the Greek experience meant essentially the fall from order." Long before the time of Plato, sev- eral ancient societies had achieved that "integra- tion" by means of myth. Gunnell gives a chapter to Egypt and Mesopotamia. In each society, a. . . life is lived essentially in the 'present' . . . the 'fu- ture' exists only as a repetition of the 'past'; the uniqueness of events is not perceived, and tem- poral distance contracts into the present. . . . In mythic thought, change in the sense of becoming or the experience of unique events is sublimated in the concrete, recurrent, and spatially grounded rhythms of nature. . . . Primordial time is the time of cosmic creation, and the events narrated in the myth are continually made present and serve as archetypes which give meaning to experi- ence. The unique event or act is meaningful only to the extent that it can be joined to an arche- type. Here life moves not historically, but ritu- alistically between significant points in the cycle of nature and society. . . ." There is no sense of history as a continuous flow full of the possibility of novelty, either for good or bad; there is conse- quently no sense of individuality, no idea of the self, which is dependent on the sense of history. Gunnell does not say why he assumes societies built on such myths survive unaltered for long pe- riods of time. Were the myths sufficiently close to the needs of human nature, sufficiently "true?" Or, would any mythic orientation which enclosed the individual in a social system purporting to be reg- ulated in accordance with the perceived order of nature have been adequate? Or, was it the cun- ning of social devices, made even more cunning by having the sanction of myth thrown over them, which accounted for the longevity of certain an- cient societies? In any case, there the examples of Egypt and Mesopotamia were: they served as precursors, and perhaps as direct influences, on the later Platonic, non-mythic effort to abolish time, and with it, change, disorder, and decay. After ex- amining the reluctance of the Hebrews to associ- ate the rescue from time with a coherently articu- lated political society, and their consequent trust in God's ability to redeem them through the very workings of time, Gunnell reaches the heart of his book, three long and brilliant chapters on the Greeks. First, Gunnell traces the attenuation of "the in- tegral myth" in Greece. He takes up Homer, He- siod, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and a few other poets, and shows through them the steady growth in complexity of the Greek idea of time: a combina- tion of historical and intellectual developments led to a common awareness of the inexhaustible potency which life has for ruining the social struc- tures men laboriously build. The inherited integral myth proved powerless when faced with the rav- ages of time. Though the Greeks' idea of cosmic time was cyclical, their understanding of human time had a different pattern, the pattern of trag- edy. Awe before the eternal yielded to the passion to perform those individual deeds of political and military greatness which earned immortality. The self became the world, though, to be sure, not the modern romantic self in all its depth and culti- vated idiosyncrasy. But just as the self contained passional elements which drove men to aspire and hence to suffer, so it contained the divine element, an element of reason, at last fully recognized, which could serve as the basis for a new vision of order. It fell to Plato, in Gunnell's account, to make a system out of Greek impulses to save men from "the futility of action" and constant political upheaval. Through reason, the philosopher could detect the underlying reason of nature and use it as the paradigm for social order. Reason would thus restore the unity of self, society and nature of the earlier mythic orientation, but now a unity</page><page sequence="4">1304 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 62 founded on genuine knowledge, not merely dim intimations. Gunnell presents an extremely skillful and creative reading of the Republic, and then of the Laws, in the light of his general thesis. Of spe- cial interest is his sustained comparison of the Re- public with the Laws: the latter book emerges as the culmination of Plato's obsession with the problem of order. A far less beautiful book than the Republic, it nevertheless is marked by an ut- terly serious practicality of purpose lacking in the Republic. Several themes stand out in Gunnell's book: the way in which the Philebus and the Ti- maeus provide the bridge between the cosmologies of the Republic and the Laws; the nature of the philosophical understanding which the higher of- fice-holders in the Laws must have, as distin- guished from that of the rulers in the Republic; the meaning of Plato's assertion that the polity of the Laws was "second best" in comparison to the ideal polity of the Republic; the change in Plato's use of the word, "law"; the meaning of Plato's concept of life as "serious play" in the polity of the Laws. One's only complaint is that Gunnell does not deal with the major contention of Glenn R. Mor- row's great book, Plato's Cretan City (1960), that the practices advocated in the Laws were heavily dependent on both contemporary Athenian prac- tices, and the practices of the "ancestral" Athenian constitution. But that is only a small complaint. Gunnell has made a substantial contribution to the history of political ideas. In addition to that -I do not mean to say "more important than that"-he has shown that a reading of some of the major texts in political theory can be, without ar- tifice or strain, perhaps even unintentionally, a substantial contribution to political science.- GEORGE KATEB, Amherst College. Aus Nichster Ndhe: Lebenserinnerugen. Vol. I. 1884-1927. Mit der Kraft des Geistes. Vol. II. 1927-1967. BY ARNOLD BRECHT (Stuttgart: Deut- sche Verlags-Anstalt, 1967. Pp. 526, 496. DM 38 each.) During the German war of liberation against Napoleon, Goethe, in the opening poem in his cycle Der West-8stliche Divan, viewed the turmoil in western Europe with a total lack of engagement and urged his readers to flee these unpleasant real- ities "and in the purer east enjoy the air of sages." To many respectable Germans in the nineteenth century, this seemed sound advice, and they were encouraged by it to abstain from political activity -indeed, to regard politics as a distasteful and de- meaning business with which a cultivated man would have nothing to do. "Politics," according to the popular saying, "destroys character." Essen- tially, of course, this was an irresponsible attitude; it left all effective power in Germany in the hands of people who could not be held accountable for the way in which they exercised it; and in the long run it had catastrophic results. It would be wholly appropriate, Arnold Brecht writes with an allusion to the lines quoted above, to compose an essay entitled "Goethe's Co-Responsibility for the World War." For the first thirty years of his life, Brecht was himself-as he admits ruefully but with a certain nostalgia for lost pleasures and quieter times-a "Goethe-German." Thereafter, however, as if he meant to atone for his long abstention from it, politics became his life. From the birth until the death of the Weimar Republic, he was never far from the center of events; and when Hitler's take- over forced him to leave Germany, it was to the study of the political process that he devoted him- self during his years at the New School for Social Research in New York, where, among other things, he wrote his brief memoir of the last days of the German republic-Prelude to Silence (1944) -and his magisterial study Political Theory: The Foundations of Twentieth-Century Political Thought (1959). Now, in these two big volumes of reminiscence, Brecht tells the story of his years of active service in the Weimar Republic, and it is difficult to com- ment on his achievement without breaking out in a rash of superlatives. Written with a remarkable objectivity and a freedom from rancor that is rare in books by men who have been forced to leave their country, rich in reflection upon the structural defects of the democratic constitution and the per- sonalities and policies of the men who tried to make it work or, alternatively, to destroy it, and presenting a not inconsiderable amount of new data on the political struggles of the 1920's and the permanent crisis of the years 1930-1933, this book will become required reading for all serious students of the period, and will doubtless, because of its wealth of anecdote, be mined assiduously by college lecturers. The uniqueness of these recollections is to be explained in part by the position from which Brecht was able to view the early history of the republic. After completing his legal training and serving for brief periods as counsel in the Reichs- justizamt and the Office of Economics, his investi- gation of the war aims of the allied powers and his attempts to improve German propaganda with respect to claims in general brought his name to the attention of the last imperial chancellor, Prince Max von Baden, who, in October 1918, of- fered him a post in the Reichskanzlei. Here Brecht remained for the next three years, working under seven chancellors (Prince Max, Ebert, Scheidemann, Bauer, Hermann Muller, Fehrenbach and Wirth) and experiencing, and playing a role in, the abdication of the Kaiser, the revolutionary</page><page sequence="5">196S BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES 1305 disorders of 1918 and 1919, the drafting of the con- stitution, the crisis caused by the Versailles peace terms, the Kapp Putsch, the loss of the demo- cratic majority in the elections of June 1920 (which he calls the germ of death for the demo- cratic system), the reparations debate, the murder of Matthias Erzberger, and the beginning of the policy of fulfillment. His account of these events, and of the general history of these years, is that of an insider at the elbow of those making the decisions, and, even when the story he tells is well known, the vantage point throws new light upon it. From his notes of cabinet meetings in November 1918, for instance, we learn what the ministers of state were worrying about on the eve of the revolution that was to make most of their concerns irrelevant. We learn, from one who observed it himself, of the fearful impression that the murder of Rosa Luxemburg made upon Ebert, and of the frustration felt by the much-maligned Gustav Noske when he was compelled to rehabilitate the old military system because the working class refused to provide the volunteers who would have made possible the es- tablishment of a new one. And we learn (with a surprised shock of recognition) of the cabinet's at- tempts to buttress federal authority, end the ex- cesses of private justice, and strengthen the rule of law in the country by working for gun-control laws and the surrender of weapons. One of Brecht's special missions was to go to Munich in 1921 to urge the Bavarian police chief P6hner to cooperate with the federal government in this pol- icy; and it was in Pbhner that he encountered for the first time the political mentality that was to dominate Germany in 1933. "If any commie dog tries to take my gun away from me," Pbhner told him, "I'll put a bullet through his head." Brecht left the Reichskanzlei in 1921 to become head of the division of political and constitutional matters in the Federal Ministry of the Interior. During his term there, Rathenau was assassinated, the French occupied the Ruhr, Hitler made his first attempt to seize power, and the country moved, by way of the Dawes Plan and the Lo- carno Treaties, into the period of stabilization. Brecht has comments on all of these matters, al- though his role in most of them was minor. (He is one of the few survivors of that period, he says, who does not claim to have a hand in the stabili- zation of the currency in 1924.) His real interest by this time was in the question of the relations between the federal government and the states. Because of ill-defined separation of powers, this had, on numerous occasions and particularly in 1923, caused major crises; and it was Brecht's be- lief that a basic reform was needed that would clarify the question of competence and at the same time rectify the gross discrepancy in the rel- ative size of the various states. This question, which in his mind was one of life or death for the republic, continued to hold his passionate interest after he was dismissed from the Ministry of the Interior by a conservative government in 1927, be- cause his views were too democratic, and had en- tered the Prussian service to become that state's representative on the Federal Council. Like many other proposals that might have strengthened the republic, Reichsreform was lost in the rush of events that overcame German politicians after 1930; but Brecht's analysis of the problem and the proposed solutions is highly instructive. The most dramatic aspect of Brecht's official life came in 1932 when, after Papen's dissolution of the Prussian government on 20 July, he appealed to the highest court of the land for a ruling on the constitutionality of the action. Dismissed by Papen but reinstated by the court, he carried on the fight during the short period of Schleicher's chancellorship, only to have his hopes defeated, and to be deprived once more of his seat in the Reichsrat, after Hitler's accession to power. In his lively account of these events, he shows little re- spect for Papen, recalling Briand's comment on the gentleman jockey, that the longer he knew him the more he admired his horse; but he is clear in his own mind that it was this dilettante who made the first serious breach in the Weimar constitution (a view, incidentally, which he shared with Hitler who, in a war-time conversation, ironi- cally thanked Papen for smoothing his path to power). Brecht's portraits of the leading personalities of the period are almost invariably striking and al- ways fair. The best, perhaps, are those of Erzber- ger, Rathenau, Wirth, Bruening, and particularly Otto Braun, the long-term prime minister of Prus- sia. Toward Hindenburg he is more charitable than most writers, feeling that he loyally defended the constitution as long as he recognized the issues at stake; but he feels that the Field Marshal's re- election in 1932 was a tragedy for the country and wishes that his own candidate, Dr. Hugo Eckener, had run in his place. With Stresemann, Brecht seems to have had no intimate contact, and the Foreign Minister remains an almost shadowy figure in these pages. Brecht is not, however, a believer in the great man theory of history. In an interesting passage in his first volume, he talks of his friendship with Kurt Hahn, an assistant of Prince Max von Baden and later the founder of the Salem School in Baden and Gordonstoun School in Scotland. Hahn was always talking about the necessity of educat- ing boys to be leaders, but his constant iteration of the word Fiihrer worried Brecht. It was, after all, leaders that the "Goethe-Germans" wanted, to relieve them of political responsibility. Brecht</page><page sequence="6">1306 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 62 himself wanted more engagement by more people on every level of politics in the interests of a healthy democracy.-GORDON A. CRAIG, Stanford University. The Social Psychology of Organizations. BY DAN- IEL KATZ AND ROBERT L. KAHN. (New York: John Wiley, 1966. Pp. 498. $8.50.) This book might well have been subtitled "A General Basis for the Study of Behavior in Politi- cal Systems." As far as I can judge and know the field, it comes closer than any other work to put- ting into one frame of reference an interrelated body of significant and powerful propositions about the central focus of (much) political study -how people behave in organizations. The treatment is in terms of an open systems meta-theory; organizations are viewed-so far as I can see, almost always successfully and systemati- cally-as in constant transactions with their envi- ronments, receiving inputs, transforming them, and transmitting outputs. "An open system is de- fined by its boundaries for the selective reception of inputs (a coding process) and for its typical transmission of outputs. It is further characterized by such properties as negentropy . . . feedback ... homeostasis . . . equifinality . . . and differentia- tion." As Bennis says in reviewing the book in the American Sociological Review, "no other writers have used (open systems theory) in so systematic and radical a way . . . (In so doing), they have succeeded in removing some substantial road- blocks to further development (of organizational theory) ." For purposes of optimum use by political scien- tists, the book would have to be radically reorga- nized and revised; it is, after all, not addressed to our particular traditions; the writers are social psychologists, whose major focus is on industrial management. So far as I can guess, most political science adaptations would best start off with the seventh chapter on "the taking of organizational roles." Human organizations are defined as con- trived entities, the structure of which consists of acts or events (rather than of physical properties; I found my own long standing concern about the effect of political "structures" upon outcomes greatly clarified by this open-system approach to organizations). Organizations, therefore, attain constancy and stability in terms of relationships between units, rather than in terms of units them- selves. This constancy is provided by role expecta- tions, the prescriptions and proscriptions held by members of a role set (the occupants of offices ad- jacent to a member within organizational space). Obviously, many role expectations are irrelevant to or run athwart the formal job descriptions. "The crucial point is that the activities which de- fine a role are maintained through expectations of members of the role set and that these expecta- tions are communicated or sent to the focal per- sons . . . Acts of role sending can be characterized in terms of such dimensions as magnitude, speci- ficity, intensity, etc." They then proceed to show how the fit or lack of fit between the sent role and the received role may be due to such factors as differential relationships to the productive process, differential reward receipts, noise in the communi- cations channels, etc. Any review or summary of a book of this char- acter is likely to be unjust or demeaning. This is so because a successful synthesis is, taken as a whole, substantially greater than any of its parts; and so whatever the reviewer selects for praise is, taken out of context, less impressive than within it. It happens that Katz and Kahn follow up the discussion of organizational role taking with what I regard as a very useful treatment of power and authority; summarized by itself, I do not know that it would immediately strike the reader as a great advance over everything in, say, March's Handbook of Organizations (Rand, McNally, 1966). But the precise point is that their treat- ment of power and authority is presented in gen- eral and carefully thought-out relationship to role episodes and to open systems analysis in general. This is, of course, only a portion of what they offer; they provide, for instance, the clearest de- scription and definition of policy decisions which I have seen. As the co-author of a book on Ameri- can Business and Public Policy, (Atherton, 1963) I am glad finally to get some clarification on that very popular notion, "policy." Similarly, their treat- ment of communications in organizations seems to me to permit interpreting and generalizing a good many studies of political communications (includ- ing incidentally American Business, etc.). I myself have used the book with satisfaction in a graduate seminar (at Berkeley) on interest groups; it helped make sense out of the loose no- tions of influence and pressure which help to con- fuse that topic. I also found the Katz and Kahn approach helped to clarify my own forthcoming discussion of The Job of Government Relations; Washington Representation (Bobbs Merrill, 1969). I expect to use the book in future seminars in Military Policy and in Problems of Undergrad- uate Social Science Teaching (in the latter case to help illuminate the organizational issues which teachers need to take account of in curriculum construction and course planning). Finally, I fol- lowed the ideas of Katz and Kahn (though I did not use the book itself) in a junior level second course on Administration (Michigan State U.) in order to relate the Case Studies in Public Admin- istration to each other. One of the reasons I did not use it as a text in this undergraduate course was its very wealth of</page><page sequence="7">1968 BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES 1307 ideas. On the fifth reading, I still find myself seeing new implications. Beyond that, non-psychol- ogists will generally be discouraged by its vocabu- lary. And many readers will be thrown off by the fact that the carefully worked out, convincing ex- amples are largely from the field of industrial management (plus, to be sure, some from univer- sity life and a few from hospitals, etc). The au- thors certainly are not as familiar on a day-tc-day basis with state government, political campaign- ing, etc; and, unfortunately, many of the political examples they choose are (as compared with those from business) rather superficial. However, despite a somewhat negative first reaction to this latter circumstance, I have been able to see how exam- ples from state and national government, com- parable to those they cite from business, can be used to show the illuminating character of their theory, meta-theory, conceptions, and generaliza- tions. More objectionable is a kind of compulsive op- timism, which at points Sinclair Lewis would have satirized. "Conflict" they tell us "clarifies." In Biafra? In La Violencia in Colombia? In border warfare in Scotland in 1400? In big city slum gang fights? A wider historical and anthropological per- spective would have aided; most of the examples from outside the United States are from Western Europe, especially from Norway. Or, such theo- rists of tragedy as Thomas Hobbes and Niebuhr would have helped the writers to handle the fun- damental problems of conflict and change; it is not surprising that in this otherwise extraordinary book, their attempt to tackle organizational change fails entirely to handle revolutionary or catastrophic situations. As with many other works -as with any textbook I can think of on Ameri- can government-students need to be warned against the professional, middle-class, Western Eu- ropean-North American focus of the value as- sumptions and interpretations. But, unlike most American government texts, these writers supply a theory and meta-theory which permits correction in the light of incongruous data. These reservations are important and should, since the volume ought to be recognized as classic, in any case be mentioned. But I am emphasizing them here, not in order to criticize the book nega- tively, but merely in order to point out some of the reasons the contribution Katz and Kahn have made has not been recognized in our field (and may not be so recognized) as quickly as it ought to be.-LEWIs ANTHONY DaXTER, Belmont, Mass. Contemporary Radical Ideologies. Totalitarian Thought in the Twentieth Century. BY A. JAMES GasGoR. (New York: Random House, 1968. Pp. 370. $5.95.) It takes courage to devote another volume to the theoretical explication of totalitarian systems of government. Professor Gregor, whose Survey of Marxism (1965) was greeted with critiual acclaim, has that courage. He is also a professional philoso- pher, and the lucidity and severity one expects from men of his discipline stands him in good stead as he takes us over the well-trodden ground, beginning with the founding father, Hegel, on to Marx, Lenin, and the Leninists on the one hand, and to Croce, Gentile, and the fascist spokesmen on the other. Some readers might consider the treatment of the classical elitists (Mosca and Pareto) as "protofascists" too conventional; others will find the space allotted to Apartheid and to na- tive African socialism (more than one fourth of the book) excessive. But the students of national socialism will welcome the addition of the little known figure of Ludwig Woltmann to the gallery of thinkers who informed and misinformed the mind of Adolf Hitler. As a professional philosopher, the author chooses to remain "indifferent to the efforts made to explain empirically the advent and prevalence of any specific ideology and ideologies in general." (4) He is emphatic on this point: "Assessment of the validity of the various theories advanced to account for ideologies is not one of the obligations of critical social and political philosophy." (5) Only at the very end of his trail does Professor Gregor sufficiently relent to admit that "all radical collectivist movements represent a manifest radi- calization of trends . . . increasingly apparent even in nontotalitarian states." He dutifully lists the well-known empirical facts: economic and political centralization and bureaucratization, the develop- ment of mass communications. Indeed, "some of the principal species traits of totalitarianism are already common to all industrially advanced countries . . . Without the rapid technological ad- vance . . . totalitarianism would be impossible." (339) But Professor Gregor does not rely on the usual distinction between terroristic and non-terroristic regimes. Instead, he prefers to contrast Western political pluralism and the one-party state which "fixes upon a unique community as the ultimate and fundamental source of values . . ." (327) That legitimation will be either class origin, or race, or the concept of the nation, and of these three "the nation has become the focal community of con- temporary movements of solidarity . . ." (336). Not class: "the fundamental issue of our century is not the ownership of property but its manage- ment" (340), and we are told that "Leninist par- ties . . . have never succeeded in winning the alle- giance of the proletarian class wherever there was a proletarian class to be won" (338),-a statement which students of French and Italian politics will find more difficult to accept than the observation</page><page sequence="8">1308 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 62 that even in the Soviet fatherland of scientific so- cialism "the critical search for truth is the privi- lege of the elite." (332) Hitlerism, based on the ideas of the racial folk and its leader, appears to be "unique insofar as it was apparently seriously committed to an intui- tionist and mystical epistemology." (Ibid.) But only apparently so, for "one of the principal theses of this work will be that even radical social and political ideologies are in significant measure the products of reason, experience, and observa- tion, and are, consequently, to some degree corri- gible . . ." (vii-viii). Even national socialism comes under these headings. The conventional dis- tinction between the pseudo-rational marxist and the intuitionist fascist versions of totalitarianism is boldly discarded and inverted. "The employ- ment of myths or political formulas calculated to engender . . . the acquiescence to rule, is not irra- tional or transrational in itself." The fact that "the anomic masses . . . can be, and perhaps must be, lead through the manipulation of sentiment does not characterize a political strategy or the movement that employs it as irrational." (329) It is in this sense, then, that "all totalitarian or pro- tototalitarian collectivism share a constellation of diagnostic traits that makes them more nearly like each other than like any other system of govern- ment . . ." (337). They also share in over-all anti- capitalistic tendency: "There is scant data . . . to support the thesis that the totalitarianism of the right, Italian Fascism or German National Social- ism, is the 'creation' of large-scale capitalist inter- ests." (341) All this is presented as an "attempt to provide the exposition of radical ideologies without polem- ics . . . The essential function of this volume is the rational reconstruction of the justificatory ar- guments advanced to support radical ideologies." (ix) But something more than that emerges, something like a very personal conclusion: "In our own time it has become increasingly evident that fascism typifies the form that totalitarianism has taken and in all probability will continue to take during the twentieth century" (334), and since na- .tionalism has proved, at least to the author, its su- periority over the competing ideologies of class and race, it is Italian fascism that emerges as "paradigmatic of twentieth century totalitarianism ... (336). Almost thirty years ago, Professor G. A. Borgese, then a refugee from Italy, proclaimed the same view in Thomas Mann's Princeton home. He asserted heatedly that Mussolini, not Hitler, was the more important, and more dangerous of the two dictators. When Mrs. Mann commented: Borgese, your Italian nationalism is showing I" the distinguished antifascist author was not amused. JAMES H. MEISEL, The University of Michigan. The Logic of Choice: An Investigation of the Concepts of Rule and Rationality. BY GIDON GOTTLIEB. (New York: Macmillan Company, 1968. Pp. 188. $5.95.) This is a book on what judicial decision-making is and, to a lesser extent, what it ought to be. It is written from an analytic jurisprudence point of view by a professor of legal philosophy at the New York University Law School. The book is re- lated to the writings of Llewellyn, Cardozo, and Frank but is more closely related to Hart, Austin, and Wittgenstein. It clearly illustrates the great concern shown for detailed definitions, conceptual schemes, and the use of words by analytic legal philosophers as contrasted to generalizing about judicial behavior from numerous specific instances. According to Gottlieb, the essence of judicial decision-making, at least at the appellate level, is reasoning with rules. Such reasoning consists of a process of deliberation arising out of a set of rele- vant facts designed to arrive at a decision gov- erned by procedural and substantive rules which are based on certain purposes (ch. 3). Subsequent chapters are devoted to defining each of these basic elements ending with a discussion of ratio- nality or good reasoning. Once the facts and rules are given, the process of deciding is essentially de- ductive (ch. 5). Determining what facts are rele- vant depends on the substantive and procedural rules and purposes (ch. 4). Likewise determining the rules or precedents depends on the facts in the precedent cases, the rules pre-existing the prece- dent cases, and the purposes upheld by the courts (ch. 6). To interpret an ambiguous rule involves looking at its language, intent, anticipated appel- late decisions, the reasonable man's common sense, and free discretion (ch. 7). To decide between conflicting rules requires looking to the purposes behind the rules (ch. 8). Where purposes conflict, Gottlieb takes a posi- tion between Black and Frankfurter (ch. 10). He (like Black) advocates making an absolutist in- terpretation of the Constitution or other relevant fundamental document rather than weighing or balancing the values involved. If, however, there is no fundamental document relevant to the dis- pute, he (like Frankfurter) advocates strict judi- cial restraint relative to the legislative. Gottlieb also seeks to escape down the middle of the law and morality conflict by emphasizing how reason- ing from rules applies equally to legal rules and moral rules and by emphasizing how moral rules tend to be part of the purposes behind legal rules (ch. 9). In deciding between conflicting facts, rules, or purposes, Gottlieb recognizes the importance of attempting to predict the impact of the alterna- tives on the parties, society, and future cases (ch.</page><page sequence="9">1968 BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES 1309 5 and 11). He does not, however, recognize the role that social science can play in testing general- izations about the impact of alternative behaviors on subsequent attitudes and behaviors. He goes so far as to say (p. 22): "It is clear that reasoning with rules is manifestly non-scientific. There is nothing testable about a decision, for the conse- quences which it may occasion can themselves be evaluated only in non-empirical terms." In reality most consequences are really means and can thus be evaluated in terms of their observable ability to achieve other consequences. Intuitive accep- tance is only necessary in the rare situations where ultimate consequences or purposes are in- volved. Likewise Gottlieb impliedly recognizes subj ec- tivity in proving facts, but he fails to recognize the subjectivity of choosing among conflicting facts, rules, or purposes when he dismisses Jerome Frank by saying (p. 53): "A defective mode of proof does not impair the rationality of the pro- cess of reasoning on the basis of the facts proved and believed." One does not have to be a Marxist to recognize the importance of class identification and orientation in shaping the legal reasoning pro- cess among different judges in many situations where there are conflicting facts, rules, or pur- poses. In his initial and concluding chapters, Gottlieb defines rationality or good reasoning in terms of reasoning procedure rather than in terms of the relation between consequences and purposes. Thus a judge is deciding rationally if his reasoning is governed by the relevant facts, rules, and purposes as determined by the above-described procedures. The alternative would be to say a judge is decid- ing rationally if the consequences of his decision are in conformity with his purposes. Social scien- tists including political scientists can thus contrib- ute to making judicial decision making more ra- tional by testing generalizations as to the nature of the purposes of judges and the public and the nature of the social conseqences of alternative decisions.-STUART S. NAGEL, University of Illinois. The Social and Political Thought of Karl Marx, BY SHLOMO AVINERI. (London: Cambridge Uni- versity Press, 1968. Pp. 269. $8.50.) As the author himself remarks, yet another book on Marx may be difficult to justify. Not so, however, with this one. In addition to its substan- tive contributions, of which more below, Avineri's concise and thoughtful explications of Marx's basic ideas will serve general readers and begin- ning students alike as one of the more lucid avail- able interpretations of a complex subject. Profes- sional scholars are no doubt perfectly competent to deal with Marx's specialized and archaic philo- sophical vocabulary, but many novices will surely be thankful for Avineri's clear explanations of seemingly arcane passages, like the following from the early writings: "Subject and predicate [in He- gel's philosophy] have, therefore, an inverted rela- tion to each other; a mystical subject-object, or a Subjectivity reaching beyond the object, the abso- lute subject as a process of self-alienation and of return from alienation into itself, and at the same time of reabsorption of this alienation, the subject of this process; pure, unceasing revolving within itself." The author's primary aim, of course, is to pro- vide more than a clear rendering of the complexi- ties of Marx's thought. He has designed this book as a contribution to the historic and continuing debate over what in that thought is vital-human- ism, determinism, liberalism, authoritarianism, neurosis, prophecy, social myopia, or whatever. He believes, and many scholars will concur, that the debate has been slanted by distortions flowing from diverse political objectives and academic vogues. Thus we now have Marx 'a la Engels, Lenin, Lukacs, Hook, Sartre, Calves, Cornu, Fromm, Tucker, and others. Europeans quote Marx to criticize the Soviet Union, Americans re- construct Marx to condemn Communism, and the New Left revives Marx to berate the Establish- ment. The result, according to Avineri, is that par- tisan exegetes have upset the inner balance of Marx's thought, especially by distinguishing sharply the young from the elder man, and we have thereby lost sight of much of the unity and fundamental harmony of the principles he es- poused. The Social and Political Thought of Karl Marx seeks simply to restore the balance, to res- cue Marx from both his friends and enemies. Avineri's substantive and polemical accomplish- ment, then, is his closely reasoned and carefully documented argument that the bulk of what Marx said and wrote remains consistent throughout. His rationale is intricate, covers two hundred and fifty pages, and cannot be summarized with justice here. But two major points of emphasis do deserve mention. The first is the transformative method, which Marx borrowed from Feuerbach and used to upend Hegel. Avineri shows how this philo- sophical device is first expounded in the early writings and then woven into later works. Em- ployed as a critical tool, it provides the constant framework of, inquiry which generates Marx's early interest in alienation and later concern with economics. Secondly, Avineri devotes several chapters to Marx's views on praxis and revolution, tracing them through a variety of sources includ- ing the early writings, the Manifesto, Book III of Capital, letters, speeches, and works on the mid- century revolutions and the Paris Commune. In</page><page sequence="10">1310 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 62 these sources, according to the author, the founder of Marxism-Leninism maintained that the histori- cal consciousness of the proletariat, and an in- creasing degree of managerial control of industry, will develop dialectically. Where the two trends merge, capitalism will gradually transform itself into socialism without the midwifery of either a conspiratorial Communist Party or a Jacobin-style paroxysm of violence. That is to say, Marx never really abandoned his early humanism to a harsh materialistic determinism. This reviewer thinks Avineri's interpretation of Marx a good one, cogently and persuasively argued, never unreasonable or dogmatic. If it stimulates a re-evaluation of Marx, as the author hopes, so much the better. Others no doubt will research the enormous bibliography of writings by Marx, his disciples and students, and deploy a dif- ferent combination of key quotations in order to contradict Avineri's findings. Their conclusions will not decisively refute his, however, for it is in the nature of such inquiry that while facts are readily procured, their meaning in totality cannot be definitely ascertained. Meanwhile, even scholars who question the book's broad theme of consis- tency will profit from scores of well-informed and perceptive comments on important extant in- terpretations ranging from Kautsky, Weber and Lenin to Calvez, Cornu, Meyer, Tucker, and Lichtheim.-DAVID M. Ricci, Pennsylvania State University. America's Political Dilemma: From Limited to Unlimited Democracy. By GOTTFRIED DIETZE. (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1968. Pp. 298. $7.95.) From the preface to the last chapter of his book, Gottfried Dietze asserts and reasserts the argument that the expansion of American democ- racy in the twentieth century has resulted in the undermining of constitutionalism, free government and individual liberties. Embracing the values of the Federalists, he is at a loss to understand how any departure from their political philosophy could rationally be construed as anything less than tragic. The wisdom and insight of Madison, Hamilton and Marshall are contrasted to the naive and foolish views and actions of men such as Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy. One cannot but admire the author's boldness and directness in presenting a position that will find few adherents. Unfortunately, his ar- gument is supported neither by reason nor fact. On the topic of economic rights, he states: "When American popular government, tradition- ally favoring the individual, became one favoring the masses, when the United States came to be considered a democracy rather than a republic, the ethnical melting pot was complemented by a fed- eral one in which the protection of economic rights melted away." (Pp. 73-4). In a typically Federalist manner, Dietze assumes that a govern- ment that expands the economic rights of "the masses" also undermines the rights of "the indi- vidual" (presumably the natural aristocracy) and thus departs from the Constitution and "free gov- ernment." It is no surprise that he believes also that the recently passed civil rights statutes are basic de- privations of individual freedoms and contrary to the Constitution. Overlooking the fact that there is no freedom of contract clause in the Constitu- tion, he asserts, "Freedom of contract is one of the foremost American liberties." (p. 132). In er- roneously thinking that civil rights statutes pro- hibit prejudice (they prohibit discrimination) he declares that, "Although prejudice should not be promoted, it should be permitted out of respect for the dignity of man." (p. 136). In Professor Dietze's view, the Supreme Court has abdicated its role as guardian of the Constitu- tion since, during the past thirty years, it has not had "the courage to seriously challenge [the] ma- jority" by invalidating laws which regulate eco- nomic activities. The fact that during the same period the Court held eighteen Congressional stat- utes, or parts thereof, unconstitutional on the grounds that they infringed personal liberties safe- guarded by the Constitution does not impress Dietze. Clearly, he and the Court fundamentally disagree on the relative importance of economic and human rights. An equally clear difference between Dietze and the Court is that the latter makes a reasoned argument for holding to a double stan- dard while Professor Dietze makes none. Because strong presidents are inclined to favor regulation of property, Dietze advocates an amendment that would restrict presidential tenure to one term of office. He believes that if Hamilton lived today, he too would favor a weak presi- dency. He concludes his indictment of what he considers to be the excesses of democracy with a discussion on foreign policy. If postwar presidents had not been under pressure from public opinion, the United States, he argues, would have rightly gone well beyond a policy of containment of the Soviet Union. In his view a showdown with the Soviet Union would have cleared the air.-PETER BACHRACII, Temple University. The Function of "China" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao. By DONALD M. LowE.

The two books under review have much in com-</page><page sequence="11">1968 BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES 1311 mon. Both were written by intellectual historians who exhibit a firm grasp of Marxist-Leninist theory in general. Both are well-written and thor- oughly documented. Both have a theoretical ori- entation representing a promising direction in China scholarship. The two books neatly complement one another in illuminating the "function of 'China"' in Marx, Lenin, Le Ta-chao, and Mao Tse-tung. They doc- ument, at the same time, a shift of focus from Euro- centric to Asiatic (Chinese, to the exact) Marx- ism. Professor Meisner's sweep is necessarily nar- rower than Professor Lowe's, but the former pain- stakingly draws a consistently informative picture of a major figure in Chinese Communist history and of the Chinese intellectual situation at the turn of the century. Towe's central concern is "the correlation of the changing ideas of China with the changing Marx- ist unity of theory and practice in different, changing situations" (pp. xiii-xiv). Successively and systematically, he gives an exposition of the intellectual situation in Western Europe, Russia, and China and relates each to emerging theory in Marx, Lenin, and Mao, respectively. Marx inherited from his intellectual predeces- sors an image of China as a despotic, reactionary, and static society. The image was gradually transformed into a view of China as caught up in the vast process of universal history. This change was due to Marx's interpretation of the opium war as having introduced capitalism into China, having ended China's isolation, and having made her a part of the international capitalist market. This argument, as Lowe points out, contradicted the materialist interpretation of history and the view of change as instigated by internal forces, rather than being externally induced. Marx further anticipated that the Taiping rebellion in China would lead to an economic crisis in England, since the rebellion would inevitably bring about a dis- ruption of the Chinese economy on which the British economy in part rested. Indeed, Marx pre- dicted that China would precipitate a general Eu- ropean crisis, a series of revolutions on the conti- nent. In his Eurocentrism, in short, Marx was con- cerned with China not in its own right but in its relation to Europe. Lenin's conception of China was ancillary to his constant endeavor "to correlate Western-oriented theory and Russian-preoccupied practice," to iden- tify "Russia's equivalence to the West" (passim). Before the abortive Russian revolution of 1905, Lenin subscribed to the prevalent image of China (and "the East" generally) as stagnant, reaction- ary, and despotic. After the 1905 revolution, and particularly after the October Revolution, Lenin began to see the East as changing, moving, revo- lutionary. In his quest for a revised model of the Marxian revolution, the East suddenly became "politically alive" (p. 67). World War I, Lenin be- lieved, had dragged the East and all colonial and semicolonial countries into the world revolution- ary process. He developed his well-known strategy of the dual revolution in colonial and semicolonial countries, a strategy that permeated the revolu- tionary movement in China. The first major step toward the Sinification of Marxism was taken by Li Ta-chao, who was an ardent nationalist, the first important Chinese in- tellectual to declare his support for the Russian October Revolution, and the foremost interpreter of Marxism before Mao. Li's intellectual develop- ment-from preoccupation with the Chinese clas- sics, to exposure to Western philosophies (particu- larly Bergson's voluntarism and Emerson's tran- scendentalism), to conversion to Marxism, to the advocacy of a peasant revolution in China-is carefully detailed by Meisner. Born in 1888 and secretly executed in 1927, Li is now honored by the CCP as its true founder and greatest martyr. Li became chief librarian at Peking University in 1918, in which capacity he influenced his young as- sistant, Mao Tse-tung. Throughout his intellectual development, Li subscribed to a mystical vision of an imminent global regeneration in which China played a cen- tral role, a vision that was reinforced by the Octo- ber Revolution. China was a "proletarian nation," which although lacking the economic base for so- cialism, was ready for a Marxist revolutionary movement; she would join the forces of world proletariat because China as a nation had suffered under international capitalism. Li's populism made it easy for him to support the Communist alliance with the KMT in 1923; in fact, he be- came the only Communist member of the KMT presidium. Though strong, Li's populism showed reserva- tions toward the urban proletariat. Thus, after the failure of the CCP-KMT alliance, Li was among the first to turn his attention to the peasantry and the countryside. As early as 1919 he had called upon the Chinese youth to go to the villages in order to liberate the peasants as a revolutionary force. In a 1925 article on "Land and the Peas- ants" (highly suggestive of Mao's "Hunan Re- port") Li assigned the peasantry the central role in a communist revolution in China. This strategic modification of doctrine became a key factor in Mao-Tse-tung's thoroughgoing Sini- fication of Marxism. Mao became progressively disillusioned with the efficacy of the Soviet model for China and he increasingly stressed the unique features of the Chinese situation. Mao retained the nationalist and populist ideas of Li but he was a far more astute student of Lenin than his men- tor. Li did not appreciate the pivotal role of the</page><page sequence="12">1312 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 62 Communist party in organizing and leading the peasants. He did not fully perceive the importance of military organization and military activity. And he did not see the unity of peasant revolutionary activity in the countryside and proletarian revo- lutionary activity in the urban centers. These two books represent a step in the right direction in China scholarship-a move toward a theoretical approach to an understanding of com- munism in China. The studies of China-as the early studies of the Soviet Union-have been ov- erburdened with descriptive and historical detail, Franz Schurmann's brilliant Ideology and Organi- zation in Communist China (1966) being a major exception. What is needed is a more conceptual treatment of China as a type of communist re- gime-the kind of treatment now well under way in Soviet studies and best exemplified in the work of Alfred G. Meyer and Robert C. Tucker, among others. It is time, in short, to begin the crucial task of incorporating the mass of available data into a theoretical structure for the study of Com- munist China in the context of the comparative study of communist political systems.-MOSTAFA REJAI, Miami University. Bolingbroke and His Circle: the Politics of Nos- talgia in the Age of Walpole. By ISAAc KRAM- NicK. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1968. Pp. 321. $6.95.) This book should do much to disabuse students of political thought of the notion that Augustan England was, as dismissed in Sabine's classic guide, "a period of quiescence or even of stag- nation." For, in seeking to determine reasons for the Bolingbroke-Walpole feud-and the appeal of the former, reputedly a philosopher to later To- ries, Professor Kramnick bares an ideological divi- sion in English political life in the years from Locke to Hume. The struggle betwen Walpole's government and Bolingbroke's opposition did not, he finds, turn mainly upon a concern with the dig- nity and emolument of public office; more impor- tantly, it involved a clash of different sets of ideas about society and politics. Thus the central figure of this study emerges, not as a mere opportunist inventing principles to suit the exigencies of the moment, but as the "full-blown spokesman" of gentry discontent with basic social assumptions "from which he never wavered" (p. 37). The author interprets Bolingbroke's political at- titudes, and those of his coadjutors-principally Swift, Pope, Gay, and Lyttleton, as, in a negative way, "inextricably bound" to the financial revolu- tion of 1690-1740. The Viscount assailed the new world of liberal capitalism-endorsed and, in part, sponsored by Walpole's regime-because, in cor- rupting political life and undermining a traditional society, it was threatening the fundamental consti- tutional balance. Here, Bolingbroke is seen as a "frightened Harringtonian" who knew that, with the rise of moneyed and decline of landed property, the law of the balance, which had elevated the gentry-led Commons and perfected the Tudor constitution, now militated against nobility, gen- try, and family. Yet he abandoned Harrington for Machiavelli in "the summation of his political writings and career" (p. 163), and looked to a great man, above politics, to again restore the constitution and reform a corrupt society. "The Patriot King, the great testament of Bolingbroke's Opposition," Kramnick concludes, "explains . . . the movement's failure . . . Bolingbroke, because of his . . . obsession with morality, example, and the just ruler, befuddled his institutional insights" (p. 168). To support his claim of an Augustan ideological conflict, the author compares positions in the Bol- ingbroke-Walpole confrontation. In almost all areas, they are seen as opposed. Bolingbroke, e.g., used traditional Whig conceptions of the past to argue, against-paradoxically-Tory interpreta- tions in the Walpole press, that 1688 had but re- stored and renewed the liberties of an immemorial constitution; he challenged Locke because the lat- ter, "given the official stamp of the government and the Whig Establishment" (p. 117), was being used to negate the institutions and values of a 'genuine' polity; he rejected Walpole's two-party- struggle view of politics and distinguished between a faction (the 'anti-constitutional' Whig regime) and a national 'party' (his 'constitutional' opposi- tion); and he espoused the right of constituents (reflecting the national consensus) to instruct their delegates (being corrupted by the ministry and moneyed interest) while Walpole's apologists denounced the radical theory of representation. Thus is explained Bolingbroke's role as both con- servative and 'populist' spokesman for the declin- ing gentry, and his appeal to later Tories-and radicals. Professor Kramnick's is, on the whole, an excel- lent book-erudite, penetrating, and extremely well-written. But, while his knowledge of Boling- broke is most impressive, when he moves away from the fulcrum of his inquiry, he is, in places, on somewhat less sure ground. Defoe is a case in point. To credit his "huge literary output" with consistently liberal views and then assert that all that he wrote "paid tribute to the ideas, institu- tions, and society . . . over which Walpole pre- sided" (pp. 188-189) needs explaining. On one side, Defoe clearly "embodied the projecting spirit" (p. 193). Yet his was a bifocal mental out- look; he, too, could, on occasion, condemn the 'villainy' of projecting and stockjobbing, attack the big companies for various forms of 'knavery' including 'parliament-jobbing,' and demand cor-</page><page sequence="13">1968 BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES 1313 rupt-practices legislation. And, rather than being mere popularizations of Locke (p. 189), his serious views on the origins of government are closer to Bolingbroke's. Both, e.g., saw family groups as the fundamental units in a pre-political condition, landed property as the basis of legitimate power, the state as formed by an association of families, and the contract as between people (family heads) and prince. Furthermore, both scored party gov- ernment. Finally, the author's ignoring of Defoe as a link in the revival of the radical theory of repre- sentation (pp. 169-174, 243-250) is perplexing; for, in his prime, he was the foremost exponent of the theory-and of the doctrine of the 'original power' of the people (both flatly rejected by Walpole). All of this, Defoe's and Swift's simultaneous coun- seling of the same minister (Harley), and Defoe's service, in 1713-1714, to Bolingbroke himself (on the Mercator) suggest that the total Augustan ideological situation was even more badly tangled than is conceded in the last chapter ("The Ambiv- alence of the Augustan Commonwealthman") of this valuable study.-JAMES V. ELLIoTT, Tufts University. The Origins of Modern African Thought: Its De- velopment in West Africa During the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries. By ROBERT W. JULY. (New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1967. Pp. 480. $10.00.) It is with a great deal of interest that one picks up a book which sets out to examine the origins of modern African thought-a subject of consider- able relevance and interest at the present time. Professor July suggests that modern Africa has been shaped largely by "two of her most recent invasions," Islam in the mid-seventh century and the "scientific-technological revolution introduced from Europe at the beginning of the nineteenth century." (p. 15) Of these two major influences the author chooses to examine the latter in detail since "the more recent arrival of western scientif- ic-technological thought seems more completely to have influenced the institutions and ideas of the modern states of mid-twentieth-century Africa." (p. 15) The geographic emphasis of the study is the West Coast of Africa, in particular the areas of what are now Senegal, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ghana, and Nigeria. The focus on origins of modern African thought poses serious problems for Professor July. He does not tell us how he wishes to use the term. On the basis of the author's Preface (and especially the book jacket) we are led to assume that he means "origin" in the sense of the source or determinants of modem African thought. We expect that the author will set out these themes and show us the links between nineteenth and early twentieth cen- tury thought and modern African thought. Except for a brief effort in the Epilogue, we are destined to disappointment. By "origin" it appears that the author means that which came before the modern period. If he means more than this, it is not evi- dent in his presentation or analysis. Professor July devotes the major part of his ef- fort to an examination of the thought and writing of important West African thinkers and activists. All of these men had at least a limited "western" education and had accepted the legitimacy and to some extent the necessity of British and French influence in Africa. Some, such as Paul Holle and Blaise Diagne, regarded the contact with Europe as providing the means for the betterment of Af- rica. Indeed we see the paradox of Africans like Holle and Abbe Boilat viewing with disdain the efforts of Frenchmen like Governor Faidherbe to study and guard local customs. In sharp contrast, other Africans like Edward Blyden were concerned about the maintenance of African values and the debilitating influences of much of what came with the benefits of external contacts. Some of the studies of these early thinkers and writers are very well done, showing great sensitiv- ity and understanding. It is here that The Origims of Modem African Thought makes a significant contribution. A number of important conflicts be- come clearer-that created by the contact between relatively highly modernized societies and non- modernized societies; the disruptive influences as well as the contributions of western education and religion; the identity crises of those torn between traditional ties and a strong attraction to foreign ideas and religions, and their often torturous ef- forts to justify and come to grips with their new roles. Men like Bishop Crowther tried to resolve some of these conflicts in arguing (in his early writings) for a synthesis of European ideas, Chris- tian teaching, and indigenous African customs (p. 187). These studies of West African thinkers also con- tribute to an understanding of the diffusion of ideas along the coast of Africa, especially the major influence of the slaves returned to Sierra Leone who later moved up and down the coast, and the strong assimilationist influences of both the French and English. Unfortunately the studies of individual thinkers are of a varying quality. All too often we are at a loss to know what the author thinks and why he deems a particular writer worth quoting or sees his work as significant. Can we accept what "X" says as valid? We are seldom told. What was his contribution to modern African thought? Often one must guess. Only two paragraphs, for example, are devoted to "the significance of Africanus Hor- ton" at the end of a chapter on his work. In addi- tion, the way in which secondary sources are used is often confusing. We find statements like this:</page><page sequence="14">1314 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 62 "Everywhere Christian worship became standard, and European schooling was much sought after. . ." (p. 131). While I do not think that Professor July believes this as a general statement in the light of what he says elsewhere, comments such as this one are confusing at best. Again and again we are confronted with the problem of lack of defini- tions. The author talks about "the modern African mind" (p. 22), the "unusual turn of the Gallic mind" (p. 28), or English and French "national character" (p. 30), without ever specifying what it is that differentiates them from each other. To un- derstand their influences we must first know what they are. The importance of the individual thinkers stud- ied in this book is not questioned here. What is generally lacking, however, is a systematic effort to relate their activity to modern African thought and to set out general themes which ought to emerge from this study. As it is, we can only infer many of the author's conclusions. We must our- selves draw most of our conclusions from the material-sadly, without the benefit of the exten- sive and impressive work that went into the prep- aration of this study. Perhaps as political scien- tists we are asking too much of Professor July who is an historian speaking no doubt to an audi- ence consisting largely of historians. Yet in this instance, I think we are not. The author sets out to examine origins, the relationship of the contact between individuals in societies with fundamen- tally different ideas and traditions, and the influ- ence of western ideas on modern thought in Af- rica. It is in the analysis of these questions that the work is most deficient. In short, this study is of uneven quality. At times the author shows considerable sensitivity and insight, at other times he is oblique and lack- ing in clear analysis. Despite its shortcomings, The Origins of Modern African Thought will be useful as a reference work for those interested in the po- litical thought and influence of nineteenth and early twentieth century West African thinkers who had extensive contact with the West.-FRED M. HAYWARD, University of Wisconsin. Freud: Political and Social Thought. BY PAUL RGA- ZEN, (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1968. Pp. 322. $6.95.) The author notes at the outset that a theory of human nature has been an integral part of politi- cal philosophy throughout its entire history. In the Republic, for example, Plato offers not only a theory concerning the nature of the human psyche but also (books VIII and IX) the first social psy- chology in Western thought. Very little of subse- quent political philosophy is as explicit as Plato is on this point, but the theme is never entirely ab- sent and is always of fundamental importance. Although the significance of the theory of human nature is quite obvious, it is often over- looked or not fully appreciated in writings on po- litical philosophy. Periodic reminders are thus not inappropriate, and Professor Roazen's book ought to be welcomed on this account. Nothing in twen- tieth-century Western thought can rival Freudian theory as an original contribution to the historical concern with the problem of human nature; it fol- lows that no serious work in political philosophy can fail to come to terms with Freud's thought. Professor Roazen has attempted to remind us of this fact and to show in systematic fashion the relevance of Freudian theory for present-day work in the social sciences. The author's main contention in this book is that Freud's work has been divided into two dis- tinct strains: the clinical tradition on the one hand, which concentrates on a narrow therapeutic approach, and social theory on the other, which puts exclusive emphasis on Freud's metapsycho- logical writings and neglects his clinical contribu- tions. Prof. Roazen argues that this situation is detrimental to both psychoanalysis and social theory, and especially to the latter; he writes (p. 19) that it is "impossible to understand these late social and political speculations of Freud's without fitting them into the context of his theories of clinical psychoanalysis." By examining Freud's clinical writings Prof. Roazen tries to demonstrate that Freudian theory can supply a vital ingredient for social science: a "systematic notion of human motivation" and a theory of the human personal- ity. By far the most valuable part of this book for political scientists is the section (pp. 59 if.) deal- ing with an application of the insights afforded by psychoanalysis to the research techniques widely used at present in political science. Prof. Roazen shows that, if the data gathered in questionnaires and surveys and in the analysis of political behav- ior (e.g. voting) is evaluated without the sophisti- cation in the understanding of human motivation made possible by psychoanalysis, such empirical studies are likely to be of little value. Since much effort is currently invested in these studies, his challenge is quite important. Unfortunately his discussion of this point is too brief, and one would hope that the author would publish a more exten- sive account of this topic in the future. Certainly further pursuit of this aspect of Prof. Roazen's analysis is necessary for political science. But the main contention of this book is more problematical. He wants to rescue Freud from mistreatment by philosophers and metaphysicians who, he claims, have distorted Freud's work by emphasizing his metapsychological theories and ig- noring his clinical writings. He does not only want to restore the balance, but to reverse the priority</page><page sequence="15">1968 BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES 1315 of attention; and he argues that "clinical psycho- analysis has a logical independence from Freud's own social theories" (p. 112). It is hard to know just which philosophers and metaphysicians the author has in mind in making this indictment, for he does not mention any names. In fact much creative work has been done in applying psychoanalytic conceptions to social theory, even by philosophers. Outstanding exam- ples are: some of Wilhelm Reich's writings, stud- ies by individuals associated with the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research, Herbert Marcuse's Eros and Civilization and his essays in the volume Freud und der Gegenwart, and Norman 0. Brown's Life Against Death. The interpretations of Freud by Brown and Marcuse are just the op- posite of Prof. Roazen's. They maintain that Freud's metapsychological inquiries cannot be sep- arated from his earlier clinical work: "the psy- choanalytic theory of therapy has to be a theory of culture" (Brown); "Freud's theory of civiliza- tion grows out of his psychological theory" (Mar- cuse). As a result Brown and Marcuse have been able to indicate quite clearly the interconnections between Freudian theory and the traditional con- cerns of social theory. If Prof. Roazen thinks that they have done Freud a disservice, he ought to show us where they have gone wrong. One cannot establish the "logical independence" of Freud's earlier and later work by quoting his private comments expressing dissatisfaction with his metapsychological efforts or by suggesting (p. 102) that Freud's later writings represent his at- tempt to "stave off his own personal disintegra- tion" by "appealing to society through social theory." What is required is a much closer exami- nation of the texts. Such an examination reveals a great many complexities and indeed difficulties- for example, in the problem of the relationship between the individual and society; but that is what makes the study of Freud so valuable for the political theorist-WILLIAM LEISS, University of Saskatchewan, Regina. Democracy's Dilemma: The Totalitarian Party in a Free Society. BY BENJAMIN E. LIPPINCOTT. (New York: The Ronald Press Company, 1965. Pp. 293.) Professor Lippincott's main thesis is that the presence of a "totalitarian" party in a "free" soci- ety poses no genuine dilemma for democratic po- litical theory. The Communist Party in western countries is not a bona fide party according to the author, but a revolutionary conspiracy masquerad- ing as a party. As such it stands outside the pale of liberal politics, especially as it would abrogate political pluralism and tolerance if it ever cap- tured state power. Thus the problem of the CP in a liberal democracy is never one of freedom of speech of individuals, but rather a problem of ille- gal action by a conspiratorial association. As a consequence, the Communist Party has no moral right to exist and can be outlawed or otherwise controlled without involving democratic theory in self-contradiction. What specific measures are taken against the Party is a matter of mere expe- diency, having no implications for the civil liber- ties of genuine democrats. A subsidiary argument of Lippincott's seeks to demonstrate that the failure of democratic theory to recognize the "true" nature of the Communist Party and the liberals' preoccupation with rights and disregard of duties have impaired the ability of democracies to withstand the internal and ex- ternal onslaught of Communism. The third pur- pose of Democracy's Dilemma is to provide evi- dence of the democratic theoretical shortcomings by a survey of the writings of American and Brit- ish socialist, liberal, conservative, and Catholic in- tellectuals and political leaders between 1917 and 1952. The structure of the book reflects these three concerns. Lippincott opens with a short historical chapter purporting to demonstrate the awesome and evil power of Communism in America and to link it to the inappropriate scruples of liberal democrats whose paralyzing sense of an insoluble dilemma has prevented them from dealing with the situation self-confidently and with a good con- science. The following three chapters are devoted to a report on the results of an examination of 6,000 books and articles that deal (or at least might have dealt) with democracy's dilemma, and to an account of the position of traditional ("or- thodox") liberals and so-called "realistic" authors. (The "realists," unlike the "traditionalists," recog- nize in the "totalitarian" party an agency for rev- olution which-given a chance-would deny the very freedoms on which it relies to promote its subversive aims.) Lippincott finds that only few writers dealt fundamentally with what he thinks is "the most crucial internal dilemma confronting democracy in the twentieth century." Forty-four American and British authors who did confront that "dilemma," however, receive more extensive treatment. The account of their arguments is reli- able, fair, and unpolemical. These chapters-the distillate of a prodigious amount of reading-con- stitute a handy summary on an important subject and are the most valuable part of the book. The central core of Professor Lippincott's concern, however, is reached only in the following three chapters in which the traditionalist liberal view of the dilemma is severely criticized and the author's own thesis is presented according to which the suppression of "totalitarian" parties in democratic states does not involve democratic theory in self- contradiction. The work concludes with recom-</page><page sequence="16">1316 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 62 mendations for meeting the danger of internal subversion by, and external threat from, the sup- posedly world-wide Communist conspiracy. We can do here no more than merely suggest briefly some of the major difficulties that vitiate Lippincott's book. Underlying them all is the ideologically distorted view of the world as a bat- tlefield on which the forces of Good (the "free" world) are locked in mortal combat with the forces of Evil (the centrally directed Communists, bent on enslaving mankind). Constrained by this mythology, Lippincott remains unaware of the ideological content and the role of the concept "totalitarianism" whose use blinds him to the differences between Fascism and Communism, and to the analytical distinctions between revolution and counter-revolution. Indeed, except for two pe- ripheral comments (pp. 38 and 221f), there is no indication that Lippincott is aware of the dynam- ics of social revolution. On the contrary, much of his argument depends on the implicit judgment that the maintenance of the status quo, tempered by incremental reformism, is a good in itself which the United States has a moral commitment to uphold all around the globe, and that the world-wide forces of radical social change can be understood only as the agents and dupes of the Kremlin. The reader will search in vain in Lippincott's book for a realistic analysis of the post-industrial state, or for an inkling of the pervasive crisis of confidence in liberal pluralism, in its compatibility with democracy, and in its capacity to organize a just and authentically free society. Rather, when Professor Lippincott speaks of "democracy," "free society," or "equality," these terms remain purely formal, devoid of any realistic content. He never defines freedom at all and confuses the notion of the correlative nature of rights and duties (which holds that the rights of one person create neces- sarily obligations in another person, and not, as Lippincott would have it, in the person claiming the rights) with a theory of contingent rights (which insists that the valid claim to a right de- pends on the fulfillment of certain conditions). A more exhaustive review would have to ques- tion Lippincott's almost total disregard of the rel- evant Supreme Court decisions (Yates, Lightfoot, and Albertson are not even mentioned; Scales and Noto receive one footnote each); his dubious in- terpretation of the Dennis case (Lippincott sees no difference between the "clear and present dan- ger" and the "grave and probable danger" doc- trines); his failure to use the many recent studies on the politics of integration and the dynamics of economic development (indeed, of all the books cited, only twenty three were published after 1956, only twelve of them in the 1960's, and the most recent systematic political science source used is Duverger's Political Parties of 1959 !); and Lippin- cott's parochial analysis of political parties. A more extended criticism would, finally, have to take issue with Lippinuott's unbalanced version of the history of the Cold War and with the nu- merous misjudgments concerning European, espe- cially German and Austrian, political events of the interwar years; his disregard of important changes in, and profound divergencies among, Communist states; his very incomplete account of the role of revolution and violence in Marxist and Leninist theories; and his championing not only of the data developed by the House Un-American Activities Committee, but also of its record of "expos[ing] for the sake of exposure," without even mentioning the Watkins decision.-KURT P. TAU- BER, Williams College. The Revival of Democratic Theory. By NEAL RIE- MER. (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962. Pp. 190. $2.25.) The Democratic Experiment: American Political Theory. By NEAL RIEiIER. Vol. I. (Princeton: D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc., 1967. Pp. 245. $2.85.) Riemer's main purpose in The Revival of Dem- ocratic Theory is "to analyze the decline and to suggest a case for the revival of democratic theory." Drawing principally from the writings of Strauss, Easton, Brecht, Cobban, and Morgenthau, he adduces five reasons for the failure of political theory "to unify and undergird political science." All of this consumes some 17 pages. Next, he ex- plores "democratic theory in particular" in light of the more general malaise that has overtaken politi- cal theory. He writes: "Democratic theory lacks a conceptual scheme which unites the values, facts, and policies of a democratic society. Conse- quently, a major task of the democratic theorist is to relate harmoniously the normative, empirical, and prudential components of democratic political life." This is a recurrent theme of the book and the very task to which Riemer devotes himself in the remaining chapters (3-7). What is the function of the "prudential" com- ponent of political theory? In the main it serves "to harmonize the values relevant to the good po- litical life and the empirical realities which inevi- tably affect our strivings to fulfill these values." What is the good life? It comes down to a "com- mitment to individual realization within the frame- work of the common good." There is some discus- sion and analysis of the perplexing questions that arise from such a formulation, though not nearly enough to guide an individual intent upon fol- lowing Riemer's prescriptions. What is more sig- nificant at this juncture, however, is Riemer's evi- dent concern to avoid being labelled an "absolutist"</page><page sequence="17">1968 BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES 1317 or one possessed of "THE TRUTH." On the other hand, he evidences a queasiness towards moral "relativism" (as perforce he must unless he wants to pull the cornerstone out of his entire enterprise). Whether he really negotiates this channel or not (we need not ask here the broader and more inter- esting question of whether any such "channel" exists) is certainly open to debate. Ultimately his commitment to his formulation of the good life is a matter of "reasoned faith." In a chapter entitled "Umpiring the Struggle for Power," Riemer stresses the need for "democratic and constitutional accommodation" for the reso- lution of conflicts that inevitably arise in the body politic. Here we find a defense of majority rule in conjunction with a textbookish examination of the role and functions of American institutions-par- ties, the Presidency, the Supreme Court, and the Congress. The last of the substantive chapters deals with what Riemer perceives to be two of the major challenges confronting a modern democratic the- ory: "the lonely crowd and world disorder." There is a plea for a "theory of transition" which will guide underdeveloped countries, if they so desire, to move in the direction of becoming mature and stable democracies. We are informed that accom- modation between the Soviet Union and United States is quite likely because the two powers "will in actuality move closer to the meeting ground of democratic socialism." The final and very short chapter repeats and expands upon the theme that "the seeming decline and apparent ineffectiveness of democratic political theory may be attributable fundamentally to the failure of political theorists to view theory as the harmonious relationship of its normative, empirical, and prudential compo- nents." The Democratic Experiment represents the first of a projected "three volume study of the political theory of American Democracy." The "theme" of this volume "is the creative Democratic experi- ment in reconciling Liberty and Authority in a large state." Riemer sets out to deal with a num- ber of recurrent problems in the "American politi- cal community." "What is the nature, and what are the uses, of political theory?" (We already know the answer to that question.) "To what ex- tent are we captives of, or emancipated from, our inheritance?" "Does Puritanism produce the good political life?" "What has been, is, and should be the theory of revolution in democratic Ameri- ca?" "Is just republican government possible in a large state?" "Upon what principles can we build a strong and prosperous nation?" "How do we perceive the American vision?" To answer these and related questions Riemer examines-in seven chapters, a "Prologue," and an "Epilogue"-the writings of Roger Williams, Edmund Burke, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, John Marshall, John Quincy Adams, and, among others, Andrew Jack- son. Chapter 2, "America's Inheritance: Two [the Judaic-Christian and British Constitutional] Tra- ditions," is designed to give us some historical and theoretical background for a better understanding of the American tradition. The very scope of the book precludes detailed analysis here. What can be said of these two works? If they were intended, and we cannot be at all sure of this given the claims made for them by the author, to be simply texts designed to introduce the under- graduate to some of the enduring problems asso- ciated with democratic and American political thought, then something positive can be said about them. The Democratic Experiment is com- parable in scope and depth to the major texts in the American theory field, and the Revival vol- ume does raise a number of salient questions and issues, so that it, too, is suitable for assignment in undergraduate courses that center on democratic theory and practices. Beyond this we cannot go. Neither volume advances the existing frontiers of thought in the realm of democratic or American theory. Surely one who can see fit to write "Locke, with superb common sense, sums up the best in Coke, the Levellers, and Harrington. He reaches back to Hooker, Aquinas, Cicero, and the best in the medieval and classical traditions. . .." is to- tally unaffected by a vast corpus of scholarly liter- ature that interprets Locke in a totally different way. And this is no small point, for a reassessment of Locke might well have served to change the thrust of Riemer's arguments, particularly those in The Democratic Experiment. Or one who views Jefferson's stance toward the Alien and Sedition Acts as libertarian (a) is probably wrong, but more importantly (b) glosses over a complex of issues that would lead us to a better understanding of the American tradition. Or, again, for one who claims that Madison ranks among the very best of our "modern political philosophers" but cannot conjure up intelligible reasons why Madison be- lieved "rightful [rather than factional or "bad"] majorities . . . will normally have their way" in our extended republic (a crucial point in Madi- son's theory), certainly cannot be awarded any merit badges for either imagination or intensive theoretical analysis. And, finally, the presumed "revival" of democratic theory which was prom- ised never materializes. The problems treated, as Riemer's footnotes and bibliography will amply attest, are not original or novel. All of them have been explored with greater sophistication and depth than we find in this particular volume. In fact, off of Riemer's own showing, we can only conclude that democratic theory was never-not until now, anyway-in a somnambulant state.- GEORGE W. CAREY, Georgetown University.</page><page sequence="18">1318 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 62 The Political Creature. By PETER ZOLLINGER. (New York: George Braziller, Inc., 1967. Pp. 303, $7.50.) Like some of the classics of political philosophy, Peter Zollinger's tract in political theory begins with the state of nature. This time, however, we start not from a jungle, whether nasty or idyllic, but from a negatively charged, dynamic, miniscule electron orbiting around a relatively huge, immo- bile proton. What is important about this primal state, if you will, is that in 1927 it was discovered by Heisenberg that it is impossible to isolate p (position) and q (momentum) of subatomic parti- cles. The two are aspects of a single event, related in such a manner that the more precisely p can be obtained, the vaguer becomes q and vice versa. According to Dr. Zollinger it is not merely the fact that the physical base of the universe is inde- terminate that is critical to our fate as social and political man. Even more important is the princi- ple derived by Niels Bohr in analyzing Heisen- berg's findings, namely the principle of "comple- mentarity," the fact that position and momentum were complementary aspects of a single unitary event, not separate realities. It is the universality of complementarity, the fundamental interdepen- dence of everything with everything within any system from the microphysical to the macroscopic, which is the law that is the basis of all matter, both living and non-living, and is the force that has pushed the evolution of things from the hy- drogen atom to our own civilization. The author takes us on a journey, one almost wants to say a Space-Time Odyssey, through the negatively and positively electrically charged mi- crophysical particles to the negative dynamic sper- matozoon and positive, static ovum to static, im- mobile, protonic plants and dynamic, electronic animals. The journey, and I am paraphrasing the author in following it continues into the social sphere with its conventions and domesticity, dom- inated by the vegetative-protonic sex, the women, and the dynamic-electronic sex with its trade, sci- ence, technology, the life military and political, the animalic male sex. Thus, the author tries to show the repetitiousness in evolution with the principle of complementarity the basis of all stages. In this way Dr. Zollinger traces evolution as it is driven onward by the principle of complemen- tarity. He discusses the emergence of organic and biological life in its most primitive forms and shows the development into more advanced forms, conscious life. He suggests that one must under- stand social and political life by the same princi- ple and shows, for example, that social life must be understood in terms of the need for both self- preservation and species preservation. From an evolutionary point of view species preservation is of supreme import with functional diversity and integration, the bases of complementarity, allow- ing for more and more advanced stages of civiliza- tion. Dr. Zollinger tells us that it is only when men understand and act according to the principle of complementarity that they can utilize this principle to preserve civilization and species de- velopment. There are a variety of questions that must be asked in evaluating a book of this kind. The first has to do with what new insights or understanding this effort at political theory attains. Dr. Zollinger himself, one expects, would suggest that the most important achievement of the book is the connec- tion he has tried to establish between a social and political ethics and the fundamental principles of the universe. One wonders, however, how the com- plementarity of proton and electron bears on the nature of an ethics that we search for. The nature of diversity, functional integration, and comple- mentarity at the subatomic level has a formal similarity to the diversity and integration that one finds and tries to encourage among men, but one learns little about how men ought to act in merely saying complementarity is important, even essential. Dr. Zollinger places great importance on Heisenberg's not being able to isolate different as- pects of the same microphysical phenomena. For some mysterious reason he concludes from this in- determinacy that somehow there is "freedom" at this level. The physicist should and usually does realize that to speak of the "freedom" of the atom because of its indeterminacy is to say very little about ethics or will. Surely the political theorist or that matter, any man, does not depend on the findings of men like Bohr and Heisenberg to dis- cover his freedom and the freedom of his species. It is this fear of the loss of freedom (or, for that matter, the hope of finding freedom) in scientific work that limits people's understanding of science, particularly in the academic community. Thus, the complementarity and freedom that Zollinger dis- covers in the physical world seems to be of mar- ginal worth in the problem of social and political ethics. One might also ask of this book what contribu- tion it makes to political philosophy. Using his "new understanding," Dr. Zollinger concludes that a tension between self-preservation and species preservation is desirable, that a tension between the individual and the state is desirable, that a tension between law and ethics is desirable, etc. The discussion of the nature of these tensions which must be resolved through complementarity adds little to what has already been written by the great political philosophers. The contributions to political and social theory found in this book add little to what we understand.

The Notion of the State: An Introduction to Po- litical Theory. By ALEXANDER PASSERIN D'EN- TREVES. (London: Oxford University Press, 1967. Pp. 233. $2.95.) D'Entreives implies that it is the shortcomings of "certain modem theorists," indeed, of "contem- porary political science" (p. 9), which motivates him to defend a more inclusive theory of the State. The new political science "bears a striking resemblance to certain old notions of the State as merely a relation of force" (p. 9), whereas in truth this force must be regularized through legal rules and these rules themselves stand in need of legiti- mation, i.e., a feeling on the part of the people that they 'ought' to be obeyed. His book is in- tended to redress the modern imbalance by reas- serting the need for political philosophy as the guide to legitimacy. Since no work more recent than David Easton's Political System (1953) is cited, one can hardly say the "contemporary" literature has been ex- hausted. One would think, e.g., that some of the recent studies precisely on legitimacy would have attracted d'Entreives' attention. But if he does less than justice to modern political analysis, this does nothing to detract from his generally incisive as- sessment of the contributions of the major politi- cal philosophers to one or more of his three cate- gories of the State. He devotes a chapter each to Force ('Might'), Legality ('Power'), and Legiti- macy ('Authority'). It is not surprising that Thrasymachus becomes the first spokesman for the State as Force. D'Entreves' analysis is good. He does not mistake Thrasymachus' embarrassed withdrawal from his Socratic confrontation for a withdrawal of force from the ruler. On the contrary, "Strength must be joined to wisdom" (p. 16). Socrates and Thra- symachus are both essential to the State. The treatment of St. Augustine is less clear. Ac- cording to d'Entreves' earlier definition, legitima- tion involves "a sense of obligation," "'agreement' on the ends to be pursued," "a civic sense, love of country, complete dedication to the common cause" (pp. 5-6). Nothing is said of the quality of the ends. But later, Augustine's state is denied le- gitimacy. It is "'ethically neutral,"' "strictly fac- tual," one in which "all consideration of values is left out," as is "any reference to its ends." While for Augustine it is a state even though unjust, for d'Entreves, without justice it is "a simple organi- zation of force" (pp. 23-24). From legitimacy con- sisting in what people do in fact accept as obliga- tory, d'Entreves moves to what they ought to ac- cept. Legitimacy is impossible without knowledge of this 'ought.' This is a hard, perhaps impossible, demand, though a noble one. It would seem to call not only for political philosophy but for em- pirical studies of possible factual 'oughts.' The State thought of as Legality, the limitation and direction of Force by law, takes d'Entreves through Aristotle, Cicero, the Romans, the Middle Ages, Bodin, and Hobbes. Space does not permit detailed coverage. One should say, however, that in building his case in this part, the author has done a masterful job of mustering the evidence with no distortion of the sources. Thus, for exam- ple, he covers accurately and to the point the dif- fering stages of law as "declaratory" or as "cre- ative"; Bodin's origination of the word "sover- eignty" to express supreme legal power in an inde- pendent national territory; and the legal criteria for Hobbes' force, in contradistinction from Ma- chiavelli's. Also good is his timely reminder that the divided exercise of power does not challenge the principle of unified sovereignty. As for Legitimacy, we have learned that the State depends not only on its acceptance by the people but on its pursuit of 'right,' of 'just,' ends (pp. 24, 159). What happens if people do not ac- cept this pursuit of justice, d'Entreves does not discuss, any more than does Locke in posing as the criteria for legitimacy the twin concepts of consent, on the one hand, and action in accor- dance with the law of nature, i.e., reason, on the other. But with the consequences before us of the German Nazi plurality vote in 1932, can any theo- rist any longer ignore this question? In terms of 'just' and 'right' ends, Aristotle's conception of the polis as natural, with its own ends but also instrumental to human virtue, was a normative concept. When this natural standard for the State was no longer accepted, the normative need was attached to the state of nature and the social contract (p. 166). D'Entreves is correct in this attribution, but it would have added to his book had he evaluated the seeming paradox in- volved in considering as normative a state of na- ture which men found it necessary to leave, or, al- ternatively, which was only a construct to begin with. Contrary to inegalitarian elitists, d'Entreves argues that the origin of legitimacy is in the fun- damental equality of rights of all men. As with Madison, presumably this would not preclude in- equality of political function as long as based upon consent. Indeed, seemingly only this kind of democratic elitism could actualize the justice es- sential to his legitimacy. The book ends with a discussion of the ambi- guity of individual rights and interests, on the one hand, and the common good, on the other, as legit- imations of power. He rightly cites Locke in this</page><page sequence="20">1320 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 62 respect, but surprisingly considers it worth noting how strongly rooted was the idea of the common good "still in Locke's day" (p. 224). Since he had already shown familiarity with Madison, he might have lengthened his "still" by one hundred years and noted some of Madison's references to the public interest. Madison boldly joined in the same sentence the "permanent and aggregate interests of the community" and the "rights of other citi- zens" (Federalist No. 10), and believed that be- cause of social pluralism and the separation of powers the two could be mutually reinforcing. D'Entreves might have explored this possibility, especially since we live in an age stressing individ- ual rights and he is heavily committed to the common good. Though subtitled 'An Introduction to Political Theory,' this revised English version of the origi- nal 1962 Italian edition would be hard going for a beginner. It would be most rewarding at the end of a course using original sources. Both its insights and its omissions could then be appreciated. It is one of those rare books which, good as it stands, would be better were it longer.-MAYNARD SMITH, Hobart and William Smith Colleges. Organizational Effectiveness: An Inventory of Propositions. By JAMES L. PRiCE. (Homewood, Illinois: Richard D. Irwin, Inc., 1968. Pp. 212. $3.75.) The relevance of organizational theory for polit- ical theory has not escaped recent notice. Wolin in Politics and Vision complained about the assump- tion of identity between elments in contemporary organizational and political theories. Kaufman in a piece in this Review several years ago was in- trigued by the "parallels between organization theory and political theory." And recently, Den- hardt in the Public Administration Review has re- minded us that "citizenship" and "membership" may refer to the same phenomena. It thus should not surprise the reader that Price has utilized a conception of the organization's "political system" to order a major part of his inventory. The propo- sitions there justify political scientists giving it a try. Those who study bureaucracies or political or- ganizations should find the book even more worth the effort. My choice of words is deliberate for Price's purpose and style (which is in part a consequence of his purpose) make this book diffi- cult no matter the interest of the reader. Those who prefer a more systematic and cumulative so- cial science ought not complain about the pur- pose; for those same reasons they may rightfully complain about the results. The author's purpose (with acknowledgement to Berelson and Steiner) ". . . is to present the core of what the behavioral sciences now know about the effectiveness of organizations: what we really know, what we nearly know, what we think we know, and what we claim to know." (p. 1). Fifty studies of "administrative organization" (". . . an organization composed primarily of full-time members" p. 8.) were inventoried for "information pertinent to effectiveness." Productivity, morale, conformity, adaptiveness, and institutionalization were presumed to be more positively than nega- tively related to "effectiveness" and hence "func- tional" with respect to it. (In the final model these are listed as "intervening variables.") The format of the propositions is designed to alert the reader to the level of measurement presumably at- tained on each variable as well as to inform him of conditions imposed on the relationship. Accept- ing the conceptualizations and findings of his sources as given, Price casts those materials rele- vant to his interests into a series of primarily bi- variate relationships with "effectiveness" the de- pendent variable. (Effectiveness is defined as the degree of achievement of "operative" as opposed to "official" goals.) Five sets of "determinants" are discussed: the economic system, the internal polti- cal system, the external political system, the con- trol system, population and ecology. The resulting schemata also delineate potential relationships for future inquiry and are called "models" of effec- tiveness in organizations. The propositions are subsequently summarized and ordered in terms of the variables most likely to be related to "high ef- fectiveness." Ordinarily it is not fair to fault an author for more rather than less rigor. In this work, however, the author's attempted precision complicates ex- plication and comprehension. Some examples should illustrate the unfortunate results. Proposition 3.3 reads: "Except where there is a high degree of complexity, organizations which have a low degree of centralization with respect to tactical decisions are more likely to have a high degree of effectiveness than organizations which have a low degree of centralization and respect to tactical decisions." (p. 60). Later, on page 90, we read: "Therefore, when Katz, Maccoby, and Morse note that close supervision is inversely re- lated to productivity, this inventory interprets this to mean that a very high degree of centralization is negatively associated with productivity. Propo- sition 3.3 refers, not to very high, but merely to a high degree of centralization. Data which suggest that a very high degree of centralization is dys- functional or effectiveness thus do not necessarily contradict the proposed relation. . . ." To be sure, the relationship may be curvilinear. But then again it may not be. Comparable feats of extrica- tion by degrees appear elsewhere and highlight the fact that the concept "degree" and the differences between a low degree, a "mere" high degree, and a very high degree are cause for more concern than the author has shown them. The use of "positive" and "negative" illustra-</page><page sequence="21">1968 BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES 132T tions must be carefully followed for "positive" means high x, high y, while "negative" means low x, low y. The concept of organizational "size" is defined as "volume of output" and is also mea- sured in "degrees." At another point, the invento- ry's propositions refer to "degrees" of sanctions while the discussion refers variously to numbers and supplies. The costs of concision are no better illustrated than on page 132 where we find: "The type of ex- ternal political system most likely to result in a high degree of effectiveness will have a high de- gree of autonomy; an ideology which has high de- grees of congruence, priority, and conformity; co- optation; major elite co-optation; a high degree of representation; major elite representation and a major elite constituency." The author must mean to say something like "Organizations are more likely to be more effective when their external po- litical systems foster. . . ." Indeed he ultimately says as much on page 204. Several minor notes as well. Surely there is a typo in Proposition 3.1 (page 49) which now reads: "Organizations which have a high degree of legitimacy are more likely to have a degree of ef- fectiveness than organizations which have a low degree of legitimacy." And we need not be re- minded to the point of irritation that illustration is not proof. Synthesis and systematization of a literature as voluminous as that surveyed by Price is no mean chore. And while I have quarreled over several features of the final product I would also take issue with any who would disparage this or any other equally comprehensive review of a litera- ture. We truly need to know what we know about a lot of things. Price had contributed to our knowledge of organizational effectiveness through his efforts.-DALE A. NEUMAN, University of Mis- souri at Kansas City. The Industrial Society: Three Essays on Ideology and Development. By RAYMOND ARON. (New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1967. Pp. 183. $4.95.) The three essays comprising this volume are linked more by M. Aron's remarkable person than by any systematic presentation of ideas. Thus, however one may wish to resist the temptation to indulge in the sociology of political knowledge, to examine such a volume otherwise is simply not to take seriously perhaps the most important singular factor in the book as such: Aron's aesthetic vision. The three papers are also connected by a system- atic attack on the Left. The first paper is a cri- tique of the thesis which unites the underdevelop- ment phenomenon with the fully developed na- tions. The second paper is a stong assault on evo- lutionary theory, or at least those forms of evolu- tionary theory which feed the flames of histori- cism. The third paper is an assault on the conver- gene hypothesis, which maintains that capitalism and socialism are beginning to approximate one another. However limited much of the writing is, and al- though Aron remains a prisoner of the ideological parameters he so detests, important coordinates are raised. While Aron's book is not the first effort to attack the idea that socialism is necessary to initiate the developmental process in the Third World, it is one of the few attempting to relate problems of development to those of international peace and order. In his first paper Aron shows how developmen- tal theory raises a series of causal issues that con- tinue to plague the field. He centers on what is perhaps the major problem, whether underdevel- opment is caused by or necessarily responsive to the fully developed and advanced nations. While he takes issue with those who would deny that every nation, like every man, is responsible for the consequences of his own behavior, he does not really show how national behavior is autonomous. For example, he fails to explain why nations which were not impoverished in previous epochs, nonetheless remain backward. Nor does he explain how the widespread monopoly of research and de- velopment gives advanced nations leverage over the underdeveloped nations despite intensive ef- forts on their part. And while Aron realizes that the single crop economy is a weak point in under- developed economies, he does not indicate why, these single crop economies seem to persist-al- though all reasonable evidence indicates the wis- dom of diversification. As in so many of his works there is emphasis on ideology at the expense of economics rather than as a consequence of eco- nomics. Too often Aron tends to see the problem of underdeveloped areas in terms of administra- tive strategy rather than as a matter of social structure. The second study in the volume, ostensibly a response to the tenets set forth by Morris Gins- berg, that the evolutionary or rationalistic in- terpretation of development has lost ground, per- mits Aron a statement of his own faith and rea- son. He makes some shrewd observations about what he terms the "schedule of development." He notes that whether one starts from a Marxian or Rostovian premise, development seems to imply a range of choices and decisions. The volitional character of development thus means that the quality of existence will be differential no less than the goals sought. Aron's position is that rational choice should not be equated with a plan for social life to pro- ceed through inexorable stages of history or devel- opment, but rather as a chance to live in the modem world without having to confront "devel- opment" and force it upon the political processes. Unfortunately, Aron, while describing the schedule</page><page sequence="22">1322 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 62 of development, does not take note of when and how this developmental process is to be realized. Since developmental theory no longer accepts any historical explanation, it remains more rooted than ever in teleology. In hunting for the future by ar- guing with the past, Aron's volume must be seen as a justification for the continuation of a middle class growth pattern. While the basis of a reliable schedule of growth remains the touchstone of de- velopmental strategy, Aron would prefer to think that it is the cultural artifacts produced in the West that remain the essential model to be em- ployed by the underdeveloped world. However, Aron does draw our attention to the problem of determining just what can be measured in the de- velopmental process. As an extreme rationalist he is unwilling to accept that forces outside human volition determine the outcomes of the develop- mental process. Too often he allows his own detes- tation of determinism to drift off into dramaturgy. Just as God seems to lurk behind the rationalist philosophes of the eighteenth century, so too Cul- ture seems to lurk behind the idealist social thought of Aron. As readers of Aron well appreciate, if his critical acumen can at times rise to oracular brilliance, his constructive skills remain pedestrian and at times even absurd. In his criticism of Anglo-American theorists such as Aiken, Lichtheim, and Rostow, Aron exhibits both of these elements. When he criticizes these men, we have some sterling writ- ing, but when constructive alternatives should be posited, he gives us nothing. The conclusion to the book is a series of dreary banalities, such as the following: "The breakdown of ideological syntheses does not lead to insipid pragmatism or lessen the value of intellectual controversy. On the contrary, it encourages a recurrence of rational discussion of problems which, in any case, must be solved pragmatically." Then, in complete denial of the premises upon which his book is built, he notes that: "We are more fortunate than previous gen- erations in that we are not forced to make a choice between conservatism and fanaticism." Pre- sumably what will save us is that, "We know that modern methods, scientific and technological prog- ress, and the rational organization of labor enable us to achieve the objectives to which liberals and socialists of previous centuries aspired." And finally, as if his palliatives were insufficient, we are given a set of prognostications which have the predictive force of Chinese fortune cookies. "His- tory from now to the end of the century will be dominated by two facts: the hydrogen bomb and the population explosion." And on the very last page we are told that: "On a political level, human liberties will never be guaranteed by pros- perity. The single party system and the indoctri- nation of the masses are and will remain threats or temptations." All of Aron's longings and mus- ings get wrapped up into a gnarled bundle of twine that he seems too impatient to bother un- raveling. The book is more a study of developmentalists or at least some developmentalists than it is of development. This would not be so bad had Aron acknowledged this to begin with; however his fail- ure to appreciate the limits of the text inclines one to ponder the depth of analysis. To appreciate how thoroughly out of tune Aron is with recent developmental literature, one has to keep in mind that his notion of Western developmentalists does not extend beyond Walt Rostow and James Burn- ham, neither of whom can be considered as re- cent; and Henry Aiken and Herbert Marcuse, nei- ther of whom can be considered developmen- talists. The work of modern developmentalists, the books by people such as Adelman, Apter, Pye, Moore, Verba, et al., and on the Soviet side, Li- berman and Kurakov, simply don't exist for Aron. The tragedy is that so many conflicts which are real for him no longer exist in the political world. Although Aron's book can be read either for fun or for profit, it is not likely that contemporary American social scientists will turn to it as an ex- ample of how to deal with the relationship be- tween modern industrial processes and develop- mental orientations. Perhaps M. Aron will yet favor us with the big book on this subject.-IR- VING LouIS HOROWITZ, Washington University at St. Louis. Systems of Political Science. BY ORAN R. YOUNG. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1968. Pp. 113. $4.50.) Young's book is so very badly done that I would not, ordinarily, agree to review it. Yet it il- lustrates a trend in contemporary publishing in political science whose implications for the disci- pline are worth careful examination. Since Young is not responsible for that trend, it is perhaps un- fair to use him as a whipping boy, but the point I am trying to make is, I believe, sufficiently impor- tant to justify what has been done. First, the book. Young sets out to expound crit- ically a variety of "approaches" to the study of politics-general systems theory, structural-func- tional analysis, communications theory, etc. He fails, for reasons that are both procedural and sub- stantive. First, the writing is atrocious. Cliches abound, often in most unusual form: ". . . pin down the level of interdependence which forms the breaking point. ..." [p. 25] Clauses dangle; punc- tuation is erratic and often incorrect; there is even an incomplete sentence [p. 211. Overall, the writing is repellant, and what is more important, con- fusing. The substantive inadequacies of the book are equally serious. Key concepts are ambiguously de- fined, or even remain undefined. The methodologi-</page><page sequence="23">1968 BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES 1323 cal assumptions implicit in the treatment of in- quiry are hopelessly naive. The descriptive ac- counts offered for the various "approaches" are grossly inadequate if not positively misleading. The criticisms offered for these "approaches" are trivial or merely confusing. Space does not permit more than a bare enumeration of the worst faults and a few illustrations. The methodological confusion is so severe that it is hard to illustrate. The treatment of "theory," for example, makes use of a concept identified as "inductive testing" without in any way spelling out what is meant by the term. The distinction between logical and empirical limitations on in- quiry is simply ignored. The general conception of the goals of inquiry is idiosyncratic to the point of being bizarre. A single illustration-the treatment of "description"-will illustrate the difficulties: Probably the roost basic set of variables and organizing concepts in any discipline can be labeled descriptive. The subject matter of much work in political science falls into this category of description, whose effort is more to de- lineate relevant phenomena, to generate useful classifica- tions and breakdowns, and to pinpoint the important char- acteristics of political activities than to explain complex patterns of events, to extrapolate and evaluate trends, or to make predictions. [p. 5] The confusion of meanings here is quite hopeless. Some of the more substantive inadequacies of the book can be illustrated from the treatment of "general systems theory"-a topic on which Young has written earlier. The content, if any, of general systems theory is left unstated; we are told some- thing of the kind of propositions included in the theory, but not given the propositions themselves. We are warned [pp. 20, 25] on three occasions that "the propositions" of the theory are badly scat- tered through the literature, but provided with no examples. In one place [p. 19] we learn that . . . above all, the communication and transfer of insights along the channels of isomorphisms (sic) and interlocking systems provided a real impetus for empirical work. A few pages later [p. 26] it appears that Young has changed his mind, for he asserts that: . . .general systems theory proper has been utilized very little in the social sciences and (that) it is very difficult to judge its utility at this time. The manner in which the book's poor organization and conceptual inadequacy is reinforced by ex- tremely poor writing is well demonstrated by the treatment of the very important notions of "iso- morphism" and "homology." The concept of isomorphism has been defined as "A one- to-one correspondence between objects in different systems Which preserves the relationship between the objects."8 An isomorphism is therefore more than an analogy since it refers to relationships that are closer than simple likenesses or partial similarities. In this sense, the notion of homology corresponds more nearly with the meaning of isomorphism in general systems theory. Both concepts can refer to im- portant structural correspondences across systems. But the notion of isomorphism has a broader reference than that of homology. In fact, from the standpoint of general systems theory, the most important isomorphisms are functional (rather than structural) correspondences across systems or fundamental similarities in the governing principles or processes of systems, and not homologies at all. [pp. 16-17] That paragraph contains all of the information supplied on the subject of homology! Young has written a very bad book. But what is striking about the whole affair is not the quality of the book but the fact that it appears on the open market, is expected to be successful, and has been chosen for review by at least one of the prime journals in the field. How can this be? The answer, apparently, is that books are judged by sponsorship rather than content. Young's volume appears in a series marketed by a major publisher and edited by one of the more prestigious bell- wethers in the political science flock; that alone is enough to sell the book to a great many political scientists. But if academic sponsorship is so impor- tant for sales, then academic sponsors have some responsibility for the quality of the product they endorse, for the books they include in "their" se- ries, unless caveat emptor in the name of mone- tary gain is to be the rule. Those who offer us books dealing with the "foundations" of our disci- pline should not package an edifice of sand and market it as an item of steel and concrete. In the case of Young's book, that responsibility has been shirked by all concerned.-EuGENit J. MEEHAN, University of Illinois (Urbana). The Political Philosophy of Spinoza. BY ROBERT J. MCSHUA. (N.Y.: Columbia University Press, 1968, Pp. 214. $7.50.) The dust-jacket announces this book as "the first systematic treatment of Spinoza's political thought to appear in over half a century." The author more modestly disavows novelty or the ex- plication of "knotty problems," but claims to pro- vide clarification of some central political ideas and an explication of Spinoza's "system" (vi, vii). Unfortunately he begins from an ambiguous dis- tinction between Spinoza's "metaphysics" and his "ethic of personal salvation" (30-31). McShea claims that Spinoza is not primarily interested in politics or metaphysics, "but in an ethical program for the achievement of personal autonomy" (30; cf. 204). This distinction assumes the indepen- dence of ethics from metaphysics, or at least the subordination of the latter to the former. It seems to reduce political philosophy to a means toward the end of individual perfection. What then are we to understand by Spinoza's "system?" What of the claim in the Improvement of the Understand- inq that all sciences are directed toward one goal? If the goal is personal autonomy or salvation, how is this deducible from the "philosophy of science" which McShea sees in Spinoza's metaphysics? (42; cf. 33-34). McShea himself says that Spinoza's po-</page><page sequence="24">1324 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 62 litical philosophy is derived from his metaphysics by way of his ethics (32). This would seem to imply that ethics is subordinate to metaphysics, and to confirm the cognitively low status of poli- tics. McShea quotes as the central statement of Spi- noza's political thought: "I start from the natural rights of the individual, which are co-extensive with his desires and powers." To this, he adds: "if there is any point at which one could separate [Spinoza's political] thought from his metaphysics, it would be here, although only in the light of the metaphysics can the full force of the point be seen. Spinoza knew how critical was his natural right theory to his system; he spoke of it as being the principal distinction between his own political theory and that of Thomas Hobbes" (58). Because McShea underestimates the importance of Stoi- cism on Spinoza's own teaching, he does not real- ize that the natural distribution of power is Spino- za's version of the classical doctrine of a hierarchy of natural kinds. The equation of right and power is precisely the point of connection between Spi- noza's metaphysics and his politics. One cannot distinguish between his ethics and his metaphysics because salvation or freedom is identical with knowledge of the natural order. This is the key to the metaphysical difference between Spinoza and Hobbes. For Spinoza, man is one natural being among others; the study of man proceeds pre- cisely as does the study of non-human nature. For Hobbes, natural right is essentially and peculiarly human, a result of the specific patterns of human motion. Hence man cannot be explained exclu- sively in terms of non-human motion; the "natu- ral order" is a political or anthropomorphic in- terpretation. The philosopher therefore has no special political status for Hobbes, whereas for Spinoza, freedom is identical with philosophy. For this reason, it is false to say that "Spinoza was a more consistent Hobbist than Hobbes" (138, 142). McShea means by this that, whereas Hobbes ille- gitimately restricts men's right in the state of na- ture by some form of political obligation, Spinoza does not (138-39, 172). But he also observes that Spinoza is not a narrow utilitarian egocentric (167), and that he is "more than a Hobbist" in preserving the right of the individual to rebel against the government (193), although he fur- nishes "no rule . . . for determining when and how much to resist government" (194). McShea cannot unify these assertions because his conception of Spinoza as a systematic philoso- pher of science leaves no room for the ethical par- tisan of personal salvation. Even when he equates freedom with "power to know," he obscures the absolute dependence of self-preservation (=freedom) upon philosophy as the highest (=most powerful) human activity. Thus he says that our ability to grasp the truth of Spinoza's teaching "is a matter of 'chance' or 'grace'," whereas it is obviously a function of our power to know, or natural intelligence (62-65). So far as the political teaching is concerned, McShea cannot ex- plain the basis for the differences between Spinoza and Hobbes, nor can he account for the link be- tween personal salvation and political obligation in Spinoza. His analysis of this link seems almost to rest upon a quotation from Locke (194, fn. 67); the ambiguity as he presents it is exactly as it is criticized in Hobbes. To summarize: this book has some helpful pas- sages (e.g. 168, 173, 185ff., 201), but too many de- fects. Almost all the remarks on "metaphysics," natural law and pre-Machiavellian philosophy are intolerably vulgar. (Slightly better are the com- ments on Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Locke; but Rousseau is taken exclusively as the author of the Social Contract.) The summary of Spinoza's polit- ical teaching is incomplete, and while pleasantly written, superficial. McShea radically overestimates the ease with which Spinoza may be understood at first reading (7, 180); that is, he fails to appreciate the complexity of Spinoza's rhetoric. And this in turn is because he does not grasp the complexity of traditional philosophy and religion, which he seems to regard as beneath rational consideration (13, 17-18, 42, 53-54, 132, 137, 179ff.). He shares some of Spinoza's conclusions without possessing Spinoza's Seasons. His treatment of Spinoza's atti- tude toward religion, although not altogether wrong, is altogether inadequate. He never clearly explains why it is permissible for a contemporary student to disregard the long polemic with Ju- daism generally and with Maimonides in particu- lar. He naively accepts Spinoza's assurance that political control over religion would be public or external rather than private or internal (182); that is, he has failed to ponder over Spinoza's statement that "men are to be so led that they think themselves not to be led but to live by their own mind and their own free opinion" (TP, X, 7), and that, by the equation of right and power, freedom of thought is necessarily restricted to the philosopher or free man. He therefore cannot un- derstand why Spinoza is relatively silent about "the civil rights or liberties of citizens," and is forced to disregard Spinoza's ipsissima verba in order to retain the notion of democratic individu- alism so appealing to contemporary readers (188-89). Finally, McShea's misunderstanding of Spinoza's metaphysics leads him to underestimate the degree to which Spinoza was a political revo- lutionary (cf. 196, fn. 73). He is therefore unable to speak with force or certitude on the contempo- rary relevance of Spinoza's naturalistic ethics (176, 202).-STANLEY ROSEN, Pennsylvania State Uni- versity.</page></plain_text>
