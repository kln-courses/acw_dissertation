<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAPTER II Mental and Motor Development from Two to Twelve Years' NANCY BAYLEY The Development of Intelligence DURING THE PAST three years studies have placed considerable emphasis on curves of growth and especially on the growth of individual children. Richardson and Stokes (269), applying Thurstone's absolute scaling tech- nic to test scores for children of from six to fourteen years of age, found a "g" curve which they extrapolated from birth to twenty-four years. This curve showed positive acceleration at first, with an inflection point around four years of age, and with negative acceleration becoming more marked at about thirteen; continued growth occurred to twenty-four. R. B. Cattell (116) has constructed a curve on his tests for the age range eight to fifteen years. McManama (219), using Spearman's method, found that means of test scores from nine to nineteen years increase regularly with age. Pintner and Stanton (258), testing 140 children repeatedly at yearly intervals in Grades I to VIII with the CAVD tests which have been scaled for absolute units of increment, found the curve of growth to be negatively accelerated and parabolic in form. Freeman and Flory (137) presented a curve of the mean scores for 469 children who were tested repeatedly at yearly inter- vals from eight to seventeen years. This curve shows "a slight acceleration in preadolescence." Bayley and Jones (6) gave curves of the mean ab- solute scale values for two sets of thirteen children who were tested re- peatedly from birth to four and a half years. These curves show rapid early growth, with an inflection point and slightly negative acceleration ap- pearing around four years. Although there is variation in the forms of the various curves reported, some are very similar and all of them show ap- proximately equal yearly increments of growth between the ages of six and twelve years. There are several studies on the nature or "organization" of intel- ligence-of the functions which are being measured by "intelligence" tests as they are manifested in the process of growth. Anderson (92) main- tained that during growth behavior changes from generalized responses to more specific ones; he discussed the functional relation of the organism to its environment, and pointed out the limitations imposed on behavior by structure and by developmental level. Werner (306) held that learn- ing is not a unitary function but is achieved by increasingly complex 1 Bibliography for this chapter begins on page 114. 18</page><page sequence="2">DEVELOPMENT FROM TWO TO TWELVE YEARS process-patterns, which change as the child grows older. Piaget (255) divided intellectual evolution into three levels-sensori-motor, egocentric thought, and rational coordination. Thompson (292) called attention to three aspects of growth which should be recognized-augmentation, differen- tiation, and conjugation or integration. Biihler and Hetzer (13) distin- guished six fields in which development takes place throughout the first six years: sense reception, bodily control, social reactions, learning, ma- nipulation, and mental production. Statistical analyses of the data in this field point out more explicitly the complex nature of children's intelligence. For children of ages eight to fifteen years, Monnin (234) found with increasing age a decreasing independence in the functions measured. She used the method of tetrad differences, and in one study (234) differentiated verbal and numerical abilities; in another (233) she compared tests designed to measure com- prehension, invention, criticism, and attention to a sensori-motor task. Conversely, however, Garrett's summary (140) and further analysis of a number of studies made at Columbia University indicated that such func- tions as verbal, number, and spatial abilities and memory are much more closely related to each other in children than in adults. The studies on which he based his comparisons included one on memory in five-year-old children, and one on verbal, number, and spatial abilities in third- and fourth-grade children, as well as similar studies of adults. His results were in substantial agreement for both the method of tetrad differences and Thurstone's centroid method of factor analysis. Schiller (275) gave a series of twelve tests to 400 nine-year-olds, and by Thurstone's method found four factors to account for 65 percent of the variance. Wenger and Freeman (305) made a factor analysis of a nonverbal test given to chil- dren ten and one-half to thirteen and one-half years of age and factored out memory ability and a "power" factor. Individual Rates of Growth: Constancy of the IQ In accord with the findings on the complex nature of "intelligence," many recent studies have disclosed evidence of an inconstant IQ and of wide variations from the mean curve in the rates of growth of individuals. In these studies we still find examples in which the author has grouped together individuals of varying ages and with varying intervals between tests. There is an increasing tendency, however, for investigators to attempt the control of age and interval differences, and to report longitudinal studies in which the same children have been tested repeatedly at regular intervals over a fairly long time. Outstanding among the longitudinal studies are those of Freeman (138, 139) and Freeman and Flory (137). In these studies 469 children were tested at yearly intervals between the ages of eight and sixteen years on a carefully selected battery of tests which exhibited practically uniform increments in difficulty of the scores over the age-range studied. They found 19 February 1939</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. IX, No. 1 large and consistent individual differences in the rates of growth of ability among the children tested over a period of six to ten years. Individual curves illustrate these differences as definite trends, and correlations be- tween tests given five to ten years apart are so low that it is obvious that adequate prediction of later ability cannot be made from tests given at early ages. The individual curves usually show consistent growth rates for short periods of two or three years, but a child is very likely to deviate from such a trend and develop more rapidly or more slowly at a later period. In the preadolescent period the brighter children tend to develop more rapidly than the average, and the duller tend to develop more slowly, but this does not hold true at later ages. Honzik (171) made a study of 252 children who were tested repeatedly at yearly or six-month intervals from twenty-one months to seven years of age. She found test performance to be relatively constant over short intervals of time, but decreasing in constancy with increasing time be- tween tests, particularly at younger ages. Retest correlations varied in magnitude according to the ratio between CA at the first test and CA at the second test. The correlation between this ratio and the retest co- efficients at the various age and time intervals was .92 for one form of the California Preschool Scale and .78 for the other. There were marked individual differences in test constancy; some children maintained their relative position in the group throughout the five-year period, while others shifted radically in their scores. Wellman (302) presented further data on studies of Iowa children who had been tested repeatedly from preschool to college. Correlations, in- dividual curves, and other comparisons showed wide individual differ- ences in rates of mental growth. Bayley and Jones (6) presented individ- ual curves of several children tested repeatedly from birth to four and one-half years. These curves of absolute scale scores are not steady but show inconstant rates of growth. E. A. Lincoln (202) found for chil- dren in the Harvard Growth Study that there was a tendency for greater changes in IQ when the intervals between two tests were longer. Changes were also greater for children with high initial IQ's. Rosenfeld and Nemzek (271) compared IQ's on the Detroit First Grade Test with twelfth-grade IQ's of 200 pupils and found a correlation of .31 be- tween the two sets of scores. Pintner and Stanton (258) found wide fluctuations in individual gains made by 140 elementary-school children who were tested annually for periods of from two to six years. Asch (95) has shown, by testing a group of children at nine years of age and again at twelve, that the organization of mental abilities has not remained constant over this period, but that the various factors tested change in their interrelationships. Mowrer (238) reported an average change of 13 IQ points in nursery school children tested on the Minnesota Preschool Scale and the Stanford- Binet, where the Stanford-Binet retests were given after an average inter- 20 REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. IX, No. 1</page><page sequence="4">DEVELOPMENT FROM TWO TO TWELVE YEARS val of twelve months. Seagoe (278) obtained r's of .50 and .65 between first-grade and fifth- and seventh-grade test scores. She concluded that the earlier performance tests measure different functions from those of the verbal tests given in the later grades, and that therefore the early tests are not valid measures of later school performance. Town (294), avoiding numerical comparisons, felt that the IQ is not adequate for prediction of mental ability. In spite of this overwhelming evidence that mental growth is not steady and constant throughout the span of growth, a few studies report in favor of constancy. Lorge and Hollingworth (207) found that the very superior children studied by them remained so, and that superior status on the Stanford-Binet at seven to nine years in predictive of status on the Army Alpha at sixteen to nineteen years and on the CAVD tests at or near maturity. Perhaps if one selects sufficiently high IQ's, even fairly large fluctuations downward leave a child still in the upper 5 percent of the population. Arthur (94) gave the Kuhlmann-Binet to 155 children from kindergarten through the second grade and retested them with the Kuhl- mann-Anderson in Grades V to VII. She obtained a median change of five IQ points, the most usual change found for retests of school-age children, and concluded that the predictive value of the test scores is satisfactory. When she divided the children into IQ groupings of ten-point intervals 47 percent remained in the same group on the later test, 47 percent changed one step, and 7 percent changed two steps. Gesell (143) gave examples illustrating the essential stability of mental growth. Hoakley (170) and Bradway and Hoffeditz (110) presented data show- ing the greater constancy of the "personal constant" over the IQ. Manwiller (225) found the group averages of tests given in the elementary schools in Pittsburgh over a seven-year period to remain practically unchanged for the total school system. To those who are concerned with prediction and prognosis of individual children the fact that there are so many cases whose growth is not constant looms important. If, in our attempts to predict later mental growth, we are able to discover the factors which are related to constant or variable rates of growth we may then, perhaps, decide which cases are predictable and which are not. Factors Related to or Affecting Intelligence Cultural Environment Considerable recent research has been conducted on the relation be- tween cultural or socio-economic environment and intelligence. Coffey and Wellman (118) classified 400 nursery school children according to their fathers' occupations and parents' education. These children's cul- tural status was related to their intelligence test scores, but it was not a significant factor in the changes occurring in the children's IQ's during 21 February 1939</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. IX, No. 1 their preschool attendance. Bayley and Jones (6) studied the relation of socio-economic factors to the intelligence scores of 61 children who were tested repeatedly from birth to six years of age. Correlations did not become significantly positive until two years of age but after this age some significant r's were found. The highest r's were with parents' education; these were approximately .5 at all ages from two through six years. The next highest r's were with fathers' occupation; low positive r's obtained with family income, a "social rating" of the home and neighborhood, and a socio-economic scale composed of all of the factors considered. The r's with these three latter variables tended to increase with the age of the children. (Results for this study with reference to the younger ages are discussed in Chapter I.) Pieter (257) obtained the unusually high r of .80 between ratings of social status and IQ for 1,500 Polish children. The correlation was less for children with extremely high or low IQ's, suggesting to him that in extreme cases genetic factors are more effective than environmental factors. Lichtenstein and Brown (201) found an average IQ of 92 for 500 children of Grades IV to VIII in a delinquency area in Chicago. Zadrizil (318) computed mean IQ's for children from different occupational groups, and found a difference corresponding to the cultural ranking; the mean IQ of children of day laborers was 91, of children of university trained persons it was 117. Skeels and Fillmore (280) compared siblings from homes of low socio- economic status who were tested at the time they entered an orphanage. The older siblings, who had spent a longer time in their poor home environ- ment, had lower IQ's than their younger siblings. The authors showed that in normal children there is a similar trend toward lower IQ's with advancing age, but they do not make the indicated correction for their data on the orphanage group. Spielerein (283) compared scores on a translated Binet test given to Russian and European children in the same town with scores on a revised test in which the items were equally familiar to all of the children. The Russians did poorly on the first test but were as good as the Europeans on the second test. This, he felt, is due to the importance of cultural differences in affecting test scores. Cuff (122) found that vocabulary was significantly related to cultural status. Lazar (196) found that environmental opportunities to read corresponded with intelligence groupings of children. Stout (284), on the other hand, selected a group of ten-year-olds with normal intelligence and found them to vary widely in socio-economic status, mechanical ability, musical ability, school achievement, and be- havior tendencies. Lowen (209) found no differences in writing creative poetry between children from schools in good and poor communities, when taught by the same teacher, and when the same methods were used. Better poetry was written by children with IQ's from 112 to 126. Peatman and Greenspan (251) found no differences in superstitious beliefs among 22 REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. IX, No. 1</page><page sequence="6">DEVELOPMENT FROM TWO TO TWELVE YEARS Negro children from rural and urban environments. Other studies have been made by Pieter (256) and Reichenberg (265). Schooling and Intelligence The effect of the school curriculum on intelligence has been the object of several studies. Wellman (301,302) matched preschool children for IQ and then compared the subsequent IQ's of those children who attended the University of Iowa training schools for a shorter time or not at all. She found that marked increases in IQ coincided with attendance at the university school, while gains for children attending other schools were small or negligible. These differences are remarkable in comparison with earlier studies and theories on this subject and call for further study and explanation. Lamson (195), on the contrary, found no gains in IQ for children attending the fourth grade of a demonstration school with a greatly enriched curriculum. Peterson (252) compared twenty children who had attended the University of Iowa preschool (nursery school) with fifteen who had not attended nursery school, both groups enrolled in the university's junior primary class. The two groups had similar IQ's and socio-economic backgrounds. Tests of reading readiness, vocabulary, and information yielded no differences between the two groups, but the nursery school children were more aggressive, independent, and sociable and more mature in social competence. Malloy (224) found that after a year in the nursery school, 21 children were more advanced in social behavior and had longer attention spans for both materials and children. Blanton (107) compared Texas children in rural one-teacher schools with urban children and found the rural children to be not only inferior in intelligence and school achievement, but also in socio-economic and physical status. Foster Homes and Institutions A number of investigations concerned with the nature-nurture problem have made studies of children in foster homes and of children in institu- tions. Schott (276) found that gains in IQ made by children after place- ment in foster homes were not significant when compared with gains on retests made by children from normal populations. Leahy (197) matched 194 adopted children with control "own" children for sex, age, and fathers' occupations and education. The adopted children were placed in the foster homes before the age of six months. The distributions of ages, school grades, and IQ's of the two groups were practically identical. The r's between IQ and cultural status average .18 for the adopted and .51 for own children. Skeels (77) found that correlations between foster children's IQ's and the cultural status of the foster home were near zero, but that the children's IQ's averaged much higher than would be expected from their cultural status. (See also Chapter I of this Review.) Snygg 23 - February 1939</page><page sequence="7">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH (80) correlated the IQ's of 312 foster children aged one to five years with the IQ's of their true mothers and obtained an r of .13. In part of this age range, however, it is usual for correlations between the abilities of even true parents and their children to be zero, while in another part of the age range the correlations are usually positive. Skodak (281) studied the scores of sixteen children whose own mothers were feeble-minded. The children had been placed in foster homes before the age of six months. Their mean IQ on the first test was 116, on the second 108. These IQ's were very similar to the means of a large group of 154 foster children from which the sixteen cases were selected. When divided into two groups on the basis of foster fathers' occupations the average scores of the two groups differed significantly at both tests. The discrepancy between the findings of this study and that of Leahy (197) is difficult to explain; it may be due in part to difference in methods of treatment of the data. There is no statement made in Skodak's study of the mothers' types of feeble-mindedness, or the conditions under which they were tested. If the mothers' low mentality were primarily hereditary one would expect a certain amount of regression toward the mean in the offspring but not an average above 100. It is notable that the children's IQ's drop, as they grow older, and as they reach the ages at which other investigators have found positive relationships between childrens' scores and their parents' socio-economic status. Even with these considerations, however, there remains evidence for a definite relation between children's test scores and the cultural status of the foster homes in which they are living. Studying children living in institutions, Crissey (17,121) found that borderline cases increased in IQ if moved from a home for the feeble- minded to an orphanage, while children of similar mentality, if moved from the orphanage to the home for the feeble-minded lost in IQ. The assumption was made that the more stimulating environment of the more intelligent children in the orphanage seemed to keep the IQ's at a higher level, while the lack of stimulation in the other environment allowed them to drop. (See Chapter III for a discussion of Crissey's findings as related to older children.) Hinton (169) studied IQ's of children who had lived in the superior environment of Moosehart for five years, and found no reliable difference resulting from this environment. Nine months of pre- school attendance was found by Skeels (279) to make a group of orphanage children superior in social maturity, but not in intellectual ability, to their fellows who did not attend the school. Smith and Hixon (282) found insignificant differences in intelligence and achievement between orphanage and non-orphanage children. Little and Williams (205) also studied orphans. 24 Vol. IX, No. 1</page><page sequence="8">February 1939 DEVELOPMENT FROM Two TO TWELVE YEARS Identical Sibs In the field of twin resemblances, Newman, Freeman, and Holzinger (244) have assembled their studies, especially on identical twins reared apart, and found that environment made most difference in temperament and personality, less in ability and achievement scores, and least in physical traits. Luria and Mirenova (211, 212) trained identical twins, five and one-half to six years of age, by different methods and obtained differences in achievement. After a period of eighteen months the differences began to break down. Luria (210), in another place, stated that the ratio of hered- ity to environment does not remain constant, but as mental functions pro- ceed (with growth) from simple to complex the nongenetic factors become more influential. The studies of the Dionne quintuplets by Blatz and his associates (9, 10) have not been carried sufficiently far at present to yield much of significance for this age period. In spite of "identical" heredity, definite individual differences are present and appear to be due in large part to differences in the children's environments and physical status. On the other hand, the differences are small, and there is great similarity in their growth curves in many respects. A study of siblings by King (188) showed that their scores are more similar when they are compared for the same ages rather than at the same time of testing. Practice and Instruction on Tests The effect of practice on mental test scores is still being studied, with some new light on specific factors. Adkins (90) reported the increased scores on repeated tests made by children at Moosehart. The SD's increased with practice, and an analysis of the changes indicated that the children who made the highest scores on their first test profited most by the test experience. Anastasi (91), after giving five tests to 200 sixth-grade children, gave them instruction on methods of performance related to three of the tests, and then retested with parallel forms of the five tests. Factor analyses showed that the factor loadings were very different for the two sets of tests. She concluded that factor patterns may be determined by experience, and that they may differ in the same subjects at different times as well as in different populations. Hawk (165) gave training in speech, emphasizing its motor processes; marked increases in IQ resulted. Rodger (270), using a battery of six tests administered from two weeks to three and a half months apart, found that in general the IQ's increased and the more intelligent children were more variable in their IQ's. Bilingual Pupils Studies of intelligence scores of bilinguals are not in entire agreement, but the predominant evidence points to a degree of handicap of bilinguals 25 DEVELOPMENT FROM TWO TO TWELVE YEARS February 1939</page><page sequence="9">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. IX, No. 1 on verbal tests. Among children of Italian immigrants, Hill (168) com- pared Stanford-Binet scores, given in Grade I, with Otis and National Intelligence Test scores, given in Grades V and VI, and concluded that bilingualism did not appear to diminish the IQ, and that the correlations were high enough for practical purposes in the prediction of scores be- tween the two grade levels. Mitchell (232), on the contrary, got a mean difference of 13 IQ points on tests of Spanish-speaking children, using two forms of a nonverbal test and giving the directions for one test in Spanish and for the other in English. The author concluded that bilingual children work under a serious handicap on American test scales. A care- fully controlled study was made by Barke and Williams (99) on Welsh- English bilinguals in which tests were given in both languages, and English- speaking monoglots in the same schools were given tests in English. Both groups were also given a nonverbal performance test. On the non- verbal tests the two groups were similar, on the verbal tests the bilinguals were distinctly inferior to the monoglots, and more inferior in the Welsh than in the English tests. Monoglots had larger vocabularies. Miscellaneous Studies P. Cattell (114) found large differences among IQ's earned by the same children when tested by different persons; some testers consistently gave higher IQ's, others lower. O'Neill (249) selected cases whose retest IQ's varied more than five points and assigned a reason for each shift but did not examine the incidence of these causal factors in the cases showing a smaller change. Davis (127) found "only" girls to be superior in intelligence. Wolf (317) found that girls who were successful academically differed from girls who were failures, in tests of personality and in certain items of the Binet tests. Greig (157) discussed the effects of emotional conflict. Effect of incentives on scores-Brill (111) found that well-adjusted children made better scores on the Goodenough drawing tests when in- centives were offered. Ferguson (134) and Benton (103) both found that prizes and other strong incentives did not increase scores but seemed to have a negative effect. C. Meier's study (227) on word learning gave varying results. Differential birth-rates-R. B. Cattell (115) and Popenoe (261) reported evidence of declining average intelligence because of the differential birth- rates of high and low socio-economic groups. Nature and Nurture: Comments It is apparent, from the various studies here reviewed, that inheritance is not the sole determiner of a child's intellectual status, and that many factors in his environment serve either to stimulate or to retard his mental development. It is extremely difficult, however, to control or to take ac- 26 REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. IX, No. 1</page><page sequence="10">DEVELOPMENT FROM TWO TO TWELVE YEARS count of all of the determiners of mental test performance so as to study the influence of any one of them; and most experimenters resort in part, at least, to hunches or preferences when interpreting their material. Wellman (304), for example, showed a strong preference for cultural environmental determiners of the IQ. She concluded that the IQ is highly susceptible to modification and that IQ trends can be predicted if one has knowledge of the cultural status of a child's home and the curriculum and practices of his school. Such information obviously increases pre- diction-to the extent that these factors operate. But the effects of "en- vironment" are exerted in complex ways. Homes of the same general cultural status may differ widely in their actual stimulus to intellectual development; emotional and other personality differences in children will alter their response to their environments; chance experiences may change attitudes and interests; and all of these factors interact with one another in various ways. We shall need much more specific information in regard to which factors in the environment are most influential in mental develop- ment, and their relation to innate abilities, before we can accurately predict changes in the IQ. Sex Differences in Intelligence Small sex differences have been shown for certain tests by several in- vestigators. Lichtenstein and Brown (201) have found girls to excel on several tests. Menzel (229) found East Indian boys to excel on the Good- enough scale. Louttit and Stackman (208) reported higher r's for girls between the Porteus maze and the Stanford-Binet tests. Lincoln's studies (202) of Stanford-Binet retests on the Harvard Growth Study children showed greater gains for boys and greater losses for girls in IQ. Racial Differences Studies of racial differences have been, for the most part, carefully controlled and of a nonverbal nature. Chinese children tend to be superior to American standards on the Goodenough test (172) and on the Porteus test (266) and superior to Japanese on the Leiter International Performance Scale (200). American Indians are inferior to whites in most tests, although less on the Pintner nonverbal than on a verbal test, according to Garth and Smith (141), and less inferior if reared in a white foster home (142). In the Seashore tests of musical talent Indians are below the white norms. They are least inferior in rhythm and time, and most in pitch, tonal memory, intensity, and consonance. Japanese, on the other hand, are close to the white norms (272). Negroes continue to test inferior to whites in intelligence, although cultural and other environmental factors could not be completely ruled out (201). Long (206) studied the relation between the IQ's of Negroes and their school achievement; within single grades, he reported a tendency for these to vary inversely. 27 February 1939</page><page sequence="11">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. IX, No. 1 Arsenian (93) found Jewish children superior to Italians on the Spear- man Visual Perception Test. Harmon (162) found speed of reaction to be fastest and most stable for Italians. Great individual differences were present in all races. American whites are intermediate in these racial comparisons. Superior Children E. A. Lincoln (203) compared retests of children whose IQ's on the initial test ranged from 119 to 145. The retests were made after intervals of from one to five years. The IQ's of these children dropped substantially, especially those of the girls. H. Lincoln (204) found little correlation between scores on the Cornell-Coxe and the Stanford-Binet tests of superior children, the deviations from the Stanford-Binet ranging from -26 to + 46. In general there was a tendency for the Cornell-Coxe scores to increase. MacMurray (220) gave the Pintner-Paterson tests to fifty chil- dren with IQ's ranging from 120 to 189 on the Stanford-Binet. There was a mean drop of 10.8 IQ points; while for fifty dull children (IQ's from 63 to 107) there was a mean increase of 9.4 IQ points on the Pintner- Paterson scale. The low ceiling on some of the Pintner-Paterson tests invalidates the scale for the high deviates. Gifted children have been tested and observed for characteristics of personality in which they might deviate from average children. Nevill (242) selected 78 clinic cases with IQ's from 140 to 180, and found that of the thirty-five problem cases many of the problems were like those of children with normal intelligence, including scholastic backwardness. Street (285) selected 93 superior children in Grades IV, V, and VI. They were three years advanced in both MA and social age, took part in extra- curriculum activities, and in general were much better adjusted to the environment than the average. Zorbaugh (320) studied five cases with IQ's above 180 and found no evidence for the association of giftedness with instability. In general, these researches corroborate earlier findings that mentally superior children usually also have the advantage in other traits of personality. Witty (316) found, however, that very few among fifty children with IQ's over 140 developed drives which were adequate for them to achieve conspicuous creative production. He concluded that the schools' standards are inadequate for such children. The subject of gifted children is treated by Bentley (102). Noonan and Norris (245) have reviewed the literature on research in this field. Gold- berg (148) presented a clinical study of a superior child. Retarded Children Kinder and Humphreys (187) reported the value of the observation- room method in studying mental defectives. Kinder and Hamlin (186) found that subnormal subjects usually tested higher on the Pintner- 28 REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. IX, No. 1</page><page sequence="12">February 1939 DEVELOPMENT FROM Two TO TWELVE YEARS Paterson scale than on the Stanford-Binet. Gordon (153) analyzed defec- tives' scores on the Merrill-Palmer scale into the types of performance in which they did best, poorest, and so on. Wile and Davis (308) found that mental defectives have basal ages closer to their MA's than do normal and superior children. The defective children's basal ages were also closer to their reading ages than to their age-grade status. C. Meier (227) in- creased word-learning in subnormal children by offering prizes, but the prizes lost their effectiveness when they became familiar to the children. Ramer (264) found a large number of background factors operative in 464 mentally defective children, and showed the need to consider other than measures of intelligence. Glueck (147) compared the mental retar- dation of juvenile delinquents with that of delinquency areas from which these children come and found them to be similar. He concluded that these children were delinquent not because of their low mentality, but because they came from inferior environments and from families which were incapable of supervising and directing their children. Doll and McKay (130) gave a social maturity scale to two groups of children of the same mental and chronological ages and found that those in an institution for the feeble-minded tested lower in social quotients than those not in the institution. They concluded that social competence, as well as IQ, must be considered in diagnosing mental deficiency. Unstable Children Uhler (295), Oberlin (247), and Glanville (146) reported studies in which they selected children whose intelligence test scores had a wide range of successes and failures. The cases in which scores on verbal and on motor abilities were widely disparate showed marked tendencies toward personality defects and psychoses. Those with higher motor abilities usually were delinquent; those with higher verbal ability usually had personality defects. Oberlin recommended training to bring the poorer ability up to the better as a method of effecting adjustment. Somewhat in keeping with these researches are those of Abrahamson (87) who found that unstable children had poor scores in quality of vocabulary, though not in quantity, and that they tested normally in tests of simple memory and spatial relations, but very low in other tests. Piotrowski (259) found different profiles on the Stanford-Binet for psychotics and nonpsychotics. A psychotic profile on a test should be interpreted as an inadequate measure of the sub- ject's ability. Summaries of research on exceptional children have been made by Baker and Stullken (97) and by Good (149). Other Aspects of Mental Development The following sections are concerned with several aspects of mental development which are not measured specifically by intelligence tests. 29 February 1939 DEVELOPMENT FROM TWO TO TWELVE YEARS</page><page sequence="13">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. IX, No. 1 These fields are all important in any study of intellectual development, and a number of valuable researches have been reported. Lack of space, however, necessitates only brief treatment of them. Learning Retroactive inhibition was studied by Foran (136) and by Lahey (193). Both used lists of twenty-five verbs as the original learning material. Foran used a variety of interpolated tasks and found that inhibition occurred only when the interpolated task was learning nouns, and that there was no relation with age. Some retroactive inhibition was found for the younger children, eight-year-olds, when spelling was interpolated. Lahey found that retroactive inhibition is a function of degree of intelligence and of the length of time devoted to interpolated study. (See Chapter III for a further discussion of these studies.) Adams (89) compared five methods of serial learning and found fewest errors if the children went back to the beginning after an error. Jenkins (177) had children associate nonsense syllables with nonsense drawings. They used very little visual imagery and the formation of new concepts was important for recall. Eidetic images, when present, did not appear to reduce errors. Togawa (290), repeating one of Kohler's problems of securing food by means of a stick, found two- to five-year-old children to be inferior to apes, and that understanding seemed to appear in children at about six years. Lambercier and Rey (194) gave a similar problem to four- to eight-year-old children. They found that the direct attack had a strong attraction for the children, and only after failure in this method set up a sufficient negative reaction did the children direct their attention to the detour and indirect way to the goal. Nelson (240) found that children as young as three years of age were able to use a rational method of learning, and that ability increases with age. Maggia (222) trained chil- dren in speed exercises, increasing their speed greatly, but after practice the skill lapsed rapidly and was almost gone after two weeks. Mast (226) gave a learning test to nursery school children, presenting a disturbance in the form of a bell, and motivation in the form of a toy which the child could keep. Those who were disturbed by the noise of the bell took longer, regardless of age. The reward of the toy was, however, stronger than the unpleasant sound of the bell, and all of the children learned the puzzle. Cousinet (120), from observing a four-year-old boy, concluded that children reenact their experiences with monologs in order to understand them; for example, a child acting the part of his mother learns her reasons for praising or blaming him. Memory Two studies are reported on changes which occur in remembered ma- terial. Hall (161) compared reproduction of diagrams and of pictures 30 REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. IX, No. 1</page><page sequence="14">DEVELOPMENT FROM TWO TO TWELVE YEARS of real objects for immediate and delayed recall, using eleven- and twelve- year-old subjects. The children changed the diagrams to more symmetrical figures; changes in the pictures were influenced by the children's con- ceptual knowledge. The diagrams were changed after shorter time intervals, and accuracy of recall was related to intelligence and to interest of the material to the child. Northway (246) studied recall for stories and found that children tended to transform unfamiliar names and idioms to familiar ones. (Northway's results with older children are discussed in Chapter III.) Gilbert (144) found that the hedonistic tendency in memory is more evident in adults than in children. Susukita (287) found that as the school year progressed more of the children's memories were of unpleasant things. Boys remembered more pleasant things than girls, and children from higher cultural environments remembered more unpleasant things. McElwee (214) found that feeble-minded subjects with a mental age of six years were better in a test of visual memory than were normal six-year-olds. Binet mental age correlated .336 with scores on the test. McGeoch (217) found no reliable evidence of reminiscence in an ex- periment with five-year-olds after twenty-four-hour intervals. In another study by McGeoch (216) nursery school children were compared with adults in materials of about equal difficulty of learning, with tests of recall immediately and twenty-four hours later. There were no significant age differences, and no tendencies for reminiscence to vary with intel- ligence, speed of recall, the individual learner, or intentional rehearsal. Reasoning, Concepts, and Percepts A large number of studies have been reported on the development of reasoning, judgments, and various concepts and percepts. Berger (105) found development with age in ability to differentiate between objects or ideas in terms of genus, cause, and generalized ideas. City children dis- tinguished more often in terms of values and consequences, while rural children were more likely to make their distinctions by example and description. Blonski (108) asked children to write twenty-five words that occurred to them. Younger children, eight to nine years, wrote mostly names of people they knew; the next older ones named objects of their immediate surroundings; abstract words appeared with puberty. Similar results were found when the children were asked to write on various topics. The develop- ment of logical argumentation and proof comes with puberty. Deutsche (129), investigating children's concepts of causal relations, concluded that the adequacy of the answers is related to age, sex and socio-economic status, and that they do not fit into Piaget's classes. Wilson (312) com- pared five-year-old children and adults in their responses to "action agent" words. The children gave a greater variety of specific concept responses, were more personal, general, and loose, and had more incorrect concepts. When Gozzano (154) presented children with a series of absurd and 31 February 1939</page><page sequence="15">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. IX, No. 1 logical sentences to explain, the percent of correct responses increased with age and suggestibility decreased with age. Gupta (159) tested chil- dren's responses to a story, and concluded that children's reasoning is not a miniature form of the adult's but has the possibilities of growing into adult reasoning. Kaltofen and Simon (182) studied the ability to grasp relationships when material was presented in two different ways. Maier (223) found reasoning ability to develop at about six years of age and to be related to mental age. Rey (267) experimented with tests of pre- hension with various obstacles and found that the child tends to adapt himself and to coordinate his organization with the environment, utilizing rather than submitting to experience. Pyle (262) scaled reasoning ability in arithmetic problems and reading selections. The latter depended for success more on the difficulty of the thought than on vocabulary. Reason- ing was also considered by Muller (239) and Piaget (254). Stuart (286) studied sensori-motor and conceptual thinking in a battery of tests and found most rapid development between nine and twelve years. He also studied interrelationships between the various aspects of thinking. Wilson and Flemming (313, 314) compared abilities in a variety of tests on first-grade children. Zietz (319) found that children's theories tended to be in terms of mechanical and natural forces rather than anthropomorphic and that they had a tendency to reason in circles. Huang, Chen, and Yang (174) found that neither children nor adults had mysterious conceptions of causality such as Piaget has formulated but based their explanations on previous experience. Giltay (145) found that two-year-olds can distinguish between one and many, but the first manifestations of analysis and synthesis do not occur until the age of four years. Russell (273), studying children in kinder- garten and first and second grade, found that their first concept of number is a "manyness," and that quantity and serial aspects develop later. This is a gradual process. At seven years children have concepts of "most" and "more" but not of "same" and "equal." Szeminska's (289) research showed that children learn arithmetic first by automatisms and do not comprehend the principles involved until later. These are accepted as absolute truth until twelve or thirteen years of age. Other studies in concepts of number are by Morton (236) and Oehl (248). Hildreth (167) studied the success of young children in constructing letters and numbers. Bandura (98) read children a fairy story with many references to time and found them to be primarily interested in the present with no clear concepts of different time intervals. Mott (237) studied children's concepts through their drawings, Kobayashi (189) by the accuracy of their copies from models, Newhall (243) by orienting visual forms differently and Hsiao (173) by tests of number, time, and spatial perception. Meyer (230) pointed out the bearing of the child's small stature on his perceptions of his environment. 32 Vol. IX, No. 1 REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH</page><page sequence="16">February 1939 DEVELOPMENT FROM Two TO TWELVE YEARS Chemelar (117) studied optical attention to nonsense syllables in chil- dren six to eleven years. Although there were wide individual differences, the length of attention periods increased with age. The most frequent at- tention spans of six-year-olds are from one-half to two minutes. After eight years of age girls have longer spans than boys. Some of the older children could have concentrated for longer than an hour. Gutteridge (160) found that the attention span in free play of two-year-olds averages 9.4 minutes, and for five-year-olds, 23.8 minutes. Other factors related to attention span were found to be sex, intelligence, temperament, home care, health, and the origin of the activity engaged in. Harris (163) worked out a method for studying attention during clinical examinations. Griffiths (158) studied imagination in five-year-old children by en- couraging them to talk freely in a situation in which they drew, looked at ink-blots, told stories, recounted recent dreams, and reported visual imagery with their eyes shut. When the situation was repeated daily for several weeks the children expressed fantasies which were considered to be reveal- ing of intellectual and emotional characteristics. In the field of children's interests there are few recent studies. Children's wishes, reported by Boynton (109) for Grades I to VI, were most fre- quently for such material objects as a bicycle, a universal favorite, autos, and clothing, with many very individual wishes. In preferences for form or color Engel (133) found that children under three and a half usually chose on the basis of form; after this there developed a strong predilection for color, 70 percent in the lower primary grades, after which form again became predominant. The largest percent of form reactors were of the highest intelligence group. Studies of maturity of behavior in children were reported by Hattwick and Sanders (164), Joel (180), and Iwai and Sonohara (175). Keister and Updegraff (184) studied preschool children's reactions to failure. Im- mature behavior such as asking for help or whining gave way to mature "attempts to solve alone" and persisting interest during a training period. The development of moral judgments was studied by McGrath and Hughes (218) for preschool children, and by Beun (106) for girls eight to nineteen years of age. Language Developmental changes of different parts of speech were studied by Goodenough (152) for pronouns, Davis (123) for proper names, and Bain (96) for "self and other" words. Davis (125) also found that distributions in parts of speech change very little between the ages of three and one- half and nine and one-half years. Development in structure of speech is reported by Neuhaus (241), in sentence length by Davis (126), in enuncia- tion and complexity of speech and in erroneous speech sounds by Williams (309, 310). Jersild and Ritzman (178) studied loquacity and vocabulary 33 DEVELOPMENT FROM TWO TO TWELVE YEARS February 1939</page><page sequence="17">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. IX, No. 1 in children two to five years of age; the greatest increases were between two and three and one-half years. Loquacity increased more rapidly than vocabulary. Vocabularies were reported by Williams and McFarland (311) and by Uhrbrock (296). Davis (124) compared twins, singletons with siblings, and "only" children, finding the latter to be definitely superior, and the younger twins and twins of lower socio-economic status to be definitely inferior in linguistic development. Other studies are by McGehee (215), Kohler (190), Grau (156), and Lewis (52). Esthetic Development In the field of children's esthetics, investigations have for the most part dealt with appreciation, or with the development of skills, in drawing or painting. Only a few of these can be listed here. In appreciation, K6rperth- Tippel (191) studied children three to fourteen years of age. The rudi- ments of esthetic appreciation were present even among the youngest sub- jects; marked age changes in esthetic orientation were noted at around ten and eleven years. Miller (231) secured preferences for various illustra- tive technics among children in Grades I to III. In order of preference they rank: first, full color, then red predominant, photographs, blue pre- dominant, wash drawings, line drawings, and black and white pictures. Kubo (192) found developing appreciation among Japanese children for the "rough and subtle" pictures considered by the experts to be good. Both Voss (299) and K6rperth-Tippel (191) found that children's ap- preciation of pictures could be greatly increased by good instruction. Voss (300) extended to lower grades the McAdory Art Test. Saunders (274) found that artistic ability could be radically changed through training. Tiebout and Meier (293) found that artistic ability is only somewhat related to intelligence. Graewe (155) described the develop- mental changes in children's drawings of animals. All children reach the stage of a synthetically correct schema, but only those with artistic ability advance beyond this stage. N. Meier (228) presented an interesting case study of an artistically gifted boy who had been blind. Bergemann- Konitzer (104), observing children in free construction of plastic form, found sex and maturity differences at all chronological age levels. Four studies reported musical ability in young children. Updegraff, Heili- ger, and Learned (297) increased both singing ability and interest by train- ing. Colby (119) found that success in learning depended on several factors, and that children had a tendency to simplify a melody, and to per- sist in familiar patterns when learning a new one. Higginson (166) studied children's affective experience with different musical forms. Musical enjoy- ment was not closely connected with high associative power of the stimulus. Drexler (131) found increase with age in ability to carry a melody, and a relation between the abilities of mother and child. Young children could sing descending intervals with more ease than ascending intervals. 34 REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. IX, No. 1</page><page sequence="18">February 1939 DEVELOPMENT FROM Two TO TWELVE YEARS Baruch (100) concluded from her studies that nursery school and kinder- garten children preferred unrhymed verse, and first-graders preferred rhymed verse; however, the differences were not great. Studying reactions to odors, Peto (253) found that a majority of chil- dren under five years were indifferent to, or appeared to like, smells re- acted to by adults with disgust. The transition occurs in the fifth and sixth years when the children are obliged to submit to the demands of culture. Development of Motor Abilities Several batteries of tests of motor abilities have been presented in the literature during the last few years. These have been used for obtaining a total score, or motor age or motor quotient; and the separate tests have also been compared for intercorrelations and for factors in motor ability. Ozeretzki's tests (250) have been published in French and discussed by Abrahamson and LeGarrec (88). They analyzed these tests into the fol- lowing elements: static and dynamic coordination of movements, rapidity and precision, simultaneous and alternative movements, and the presence or absence of synkinesis. Correlations between MQ's and IQ's are .31 for girls and .30 for boys. The authors believe that the tests are better adapted for boys. Wellman (303) described a series of tests for nursery school ages on ascending and descending ladders and stairs; throwing, catching, and bouncing balls; and hopping, skipping, and walking on paths. She re- ported a retest r of .98 after one week, with r's between tests at a one-month interval of .94, a two-month interval of .93, and a three-month interval of .85. These same tests have been presented in more detail by McCaskill and Wellman (213) with tentative age norms for each item. Correlations between partial scores (where similar types of performance were grouped together) range from .54 to .79 for an age range of two to six years. For more restricted age ranges the r's were somewhat lower, with the excep- tion of the scores for jumping. In most instances there was a significant gain in ability with age. There were small sex differences in certain of the tests, but there was no correlation with ascendance-submission scores. Several studies have been reported on abilities in more restricted areas. Moore (235) gave norms for ages six to sixteen for an eye-hand coordina- tion test which consisted of dropping marbles into holes in a box. Key (185) devised a scale for scoring nursery school children on the process of learn- ing to dress. She concluded that training was less important than chrono- logical age or maturation. Quinan (263) measured speed of writing in girls between the ages of eight and seventeen and found that speed in- creases gradually with age. Age changes in reaction-time were compared by Goodenough (150) for children aged from three and a half years to college students. Improve- ment occurred both in speed and in voluntary control. A slight sex dif- 35 DEVELOPMENT FROM TWO TO TWELVE YEARS February 1939</page><page sequence="19">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. IX, No. 1 ference in favor of males held throughout. Only slight correlation was found with intelligence, with height and weight, and with degree of activity (in the younger children) as observed in the nursery school yard, and none with socio-economic status. Jones (181) also presented data which showed a decrease in reaction time with age for subjects aged from four and one-half to nineteen and one-half years; age changes were most marked before age ten. Motivation in the form of knowledge of results was found to be important; for a single age group scores improved from the first through the fifteenth trial, especially in the first five trials. Pomeroy (260) compared reaction time of children five and one-half years old with adults on five trials a day for five successive days. The children improved their scores, and some of them did as well as some of the adults. Fessard and others (135) gave norms for reaction times for children aged seven to thirteen years. They also found that on the average speed increases with age. Rhythm-There are reported several studies on rhythmic responses of young children. Leibold (198, 199) observed children three to six years of age for their spontaneously tapped-out rhythms and for their ability to imitate rhythmic tapping. He found the easiest and earliest was a "primitive rhythm"; and other related forms were added to this. Between three and six years there is an increasing ability to adapt to rhythm. The three-year- old's tapping was not imitative but self-expressive, and was the playful mov- ing of the whole body, not in rhythm. Five-year-olds were able to imitate rhythms. Jersild and Bienstock (179) compared children of from two to five years of age with adults, in walking and beating time with their hands to piano music. There was steady improvement from two to five and the adults' scores were twice as high as the children's. There was some relation of this ability to the number of tones a child could sing. Scores increased with in- creasing tempo, were little affected by the complexity of the music, and not related to the time in which it was played. There was a small increase in score with practice. Wight (307) showed a gain of 18 percent with prac- tice over a period of two months as compared with an increase of 2 percent in a control group. The subjects in this study were ambulatory cases in a convalescent hospital for crippled children. They were tested for speed of tapping and rhythmic tapping. Van Alstyne and Osborne (298) compared Negro with white children, two and a half to six and a half years, on tapping rhythms. The Negroes excelled, especially at the younger ages and for simpler rhythms. They found that a child can maintain a pattern at an earlier age than he can maintain a set pace. Interrelations of motor abilities-Using tests previously reported upon by Goodenough and Smart (151), Rhodes (268) tested motor abilities of a group of Negro children. Age changes were presented. Intercorrelations between the tests were low and positive. Factor analysis tends to agree with Goodenough and Smart, showing a general ability factor and one "akin to carefulness or attention." Negroes and whites were similar in scores. 36 REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. IX, No. 1</page><page sequence="20">February 1939 DEVELOPMENT FROM Two TO TWELVE YEARS McNemar (221) tested the relation of practice to "general" motor ability, and found that the r's indicate a small general factor of motor ability which in some tests tends to increase with practice, but in other tests practice had no effect on their interrelations. Baumgarten (101) classified manual movements. Relation of motor abilities to other factors-Burckhardt (113) found a group of feeble-minded children to be definitely retarded in their motor functions. Winter (315) found children in a German opportunity school to be inferior to the Russian norms of Ozeretzki's tests. Brody (112) found identical twins to score much more alike than fraternals on the Minnesota spatial relations test. As there could have been little chance for differential practice he concluded that this points to a strong hereditary factor. Durost (132) found age changes in relative skills of the two hands in children in Grades IV to VIII. As they grow older tests involving relatively gross co- ordinations tend toward equalization of the hands, while tests involving a high degree of control tend toward greater differentiation between the hands. Summary of findings on motor abilities-These recent studies of motor abilities tend to agree in reporting age changes in the abilities measured, although most of the data are for young children; in positive correlations between scores on different tests, although the size of the r's is widely variable among the different abilities compared; in absence of correlation with socio-economic factors; and in improvement with practice on certain skills. Sex differences vary widely according to the specific ability under consideration. 37 February 1939 DEVELOPMENT FROM TWO TO TWELVE YEARS</page></plain_text>
