<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS OF BOOKS 109 have read that Nupe religion in contrast to Yoruba religion does not represent its ideas in anthropomorphic form and that the two exceptions to this are the bronze figures on Jebba island and the masks used in a dance at Mokwa called elo (a meaningless word in Nupe) which is ' quite unlike any Nupe dance or ritual '. Nadel claims that these masks, of which he provides an illustration similar to the one collected by Frobenius, are reminiscent rather of the Yoruba or of the Ibo and other tribes of Southern Nigera. (Nupe Religion, p. 214 and plate 28). The price of Tribes and Forms (?6. 6s.) places this book out of the range of most students of African art and its size and shape make it more suitable for display on side tables than for fitting into a normal bookshelf. Westafrikanische Plastik I, forms part of a series published by the Museum fur Volker- kunde, Berlin, and this volume is the second on West African sculpture. Like the first, which covered masks (and which was reviewed in Africa, xxxi. 2, 196 ), it consists of an illustrated catalogue which, in this case, covers the museum's collection of West African statuettes and carvings; 330 are described and 272 of these are illustrated in page or half-page plates. The notes give the following details for each of them: the tribe and country of origin, the museum number, the collector and the date of collection, the size, any remarks recorded in the index, a brief general description of the piece, and references to any publications which may refer to it. This is an admirable and valuable production which other museums could do well to follow. It should form part of the library of any institution or person concerned with the study of African art. Artfrom the Guinea Coast is a well illustrated catalogue of a very successful exhibition of West African sculpture arranged in i 965 by the Pitt-Rivers Museum, Oxford. It gives some indication of the wealth of African sculpture hidden away in this museum, but not enough, for the exhibition was of necessity a small one, and some of the more striking exhibits were on loan from elsewhere. One could also have wished that the brief notes on each item could have been expanded to include the same details as those provided in the Berlin Museum's catalogue. Kalabari Sculpture really requires a review to itself. It is a study made by a social anthro- pologist whose special interest lies in West African religions and philosophies and who has been able to make a detailed study of Kalabari religion and of Ijo art. The result is the most stimulating study of a ' tribal art' that has yet appeared. It gives a concise and yet detailed summary of Ijo religion and of the Kalabari ' way of life ' and of the part played by sculpture in Kalabari society. This is followed by an analysis of the meaning and forms of Kalabari art and of the association of particular motives with the different cults and institutions. Some are universal, some are exclusive to ancestral spirits, others to non-ancestral, that is Oru (' heroes ') and Owu (water spirits), others to water spirits alone. There are three appendixes one on materials and tools, the second on Kalabari and neighbouring art styles, the third on Kalabari sculpture and social change, and all this is compressed into 46 pages of text. There are 72 plates, 5 5 of Kalabari, i6 of other Ijo peoples which support his suggestion that we can distinguish two Ijo styles, a Western and an Eastern (Kalabari). The author's conclusions will shatter many of the fond illusions held by those who postulate a Pan-African cultural unity in the field of art and aesthetics, as he shows that Kalabari ideas and practices in this field differ completely from those of the Yoruba and Bini or for that matter of other Southern Nigerian peoples. This is again an essential volume for any library concerned with West African art. G. I. JONES Federation in East Africa: Opportunities and Problems. Ed. by C. LEYS and P. ROBSON. Nairobi: Oxford University Press, I965. Pp. viii, 244. 26s. (U.K.). THE contributions to this book were originally written as Papers for a Conference held at</page><page sequence="2">University College, Nairobi in November I963, which was the second in a series of three conferences on public policy in East Africa organized by the University of East Africa with the support of the Ford Foundation. In the time which has passed between the preparation of the Papers and the writing of this review (in the summer of 1966) much has happened to the economic and political relationships between Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania which makes it a rather sad experience to read the Papers. Many of them were prepared bearing in mind the declaration by the East African Heads of Government in June 1963, pledging themselves to the achievement of a Political Federation of East Africa by the end of the year. Now, however, not only does Federation seem a very long way off but there has been a significant deterioration in the extent of economic integration between the three territories, symbolized by the decision that each country should have its own Central Bank and currency. The volume contains Papers dealing with many aspects of Federation. Some are concerned with the political and administrative aspects: some with the economic, commercial, and fiscal aspects: and some with the legal aspects. There are in addition reflective introductory and concluding essays by the editors which, respectively, set the stage and emphasize the main points emerging from the Papers and discussions. There are also a number of appen- dixes; one of which by Mr. Dennis Lury entitled the Statistical Background enables the reader to grasp very quickly and almost effortlessly the distinguishing economic characteristics (contrasts and similarities) of the three countries. Most of the Papers are only likely to be of interest to those concerned with East Africa. A significant exception is a masterly con- tribution by Professor A. H. Birch (Opportunities and Problems of Federation) which sets out the conditions that must be satisfied if federal arrangements are to be successful. He em- phasizes that Federation has to be regarded as a means to an end and not an end in itself, and will not work and persist unless the people in the various component countries agree upon the objectives the federal arrangements are designed to achieve. Roughly half the volume is concerned more or less directly with economic matters. Peter Newman (Economics of Integration in East Africa) argues-at least implicitly-the case for an economic plan for East Africa as a whole, pointing out on the way that 'if the untram- melled workings of the Common Market are unlikely to make for optimal growth the path of national autarchy is not likely to do so either '. Newman agrees that by making use of the device of 'Designated Product Common Markets 'it is possible to get some of the advan- tages of planned development without a central government but emphasizes that even this requires a considerable measure of agreement between governments and peoples. Dharum Ghai from Makerere considers the distribution of the benefits and costs of the trading pattern resulting from the existence of the East African Common Market and reaches the conclusion that Kenya has been the main beneficiary, that Uganda has gained rather than lost, and that Tanganyika had suffered a net loss. This last conclusion, which contrasts with the findings of the Raiseman Commission and the views of many other observers of the East African scene, seems well founded and, though by itself it does not necessarily justify the departure (on economic grounds) of Tanganyika from the East African Common Market -for it neglects not only long-run dynamic considerations but also fiscal transfers and the advantages derived from the Common Services-it helps to explain what has sometimes seemed to be an inherent inconsistency in Tanganyika government policy: how, on the one hand, it has been an ardent supporter of Federation and, on the other, and in default of Federation, an advocate of limiting the trading freedom of the Common Market. Mr. Belshaw's chapter on the agricultural aspects of the Common Market breaks a good deal of new ground and adds significantly to our understanding of the issues involved. Of particular interest is the way he shows the extent to which there is not a Common Market in agricultural products and explains the benefits that could be obtained from changes in the marketing and trading arrangements. REVIEWS OF BOOKS IIO</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS OF BOOKS I I The other economic chapters (Mboya on Labour, Hazlewood on Transport, Robson on Federal Finance, and Van Arkadie on Central Banking) all contain much of interest, though perhaps more than the others they have a slightly dated appearance due to the changes in the political situation since they were written. I have no doubt that it was well worth while to hold the Conference and most desirable that the Papers should have a wide circulation in East Africa. With a few significant exceptions, however (e.g. the Papers by Birch, and Belshaw), it is doubtful if they require very close attention outside East Africa at the present time. A number of the authors have, indeed, already published more extended treatments of the topics they discuss in the volume and this combined with the appearance of other volumes (notably the East African Studies by Paul Clark and Philip Ndgedwa) and the changed political atmosphere make it difficult to recommend the volume to a general international readership. DAVID WALKER The Supply Responses of African Farmers: Theory and Measurement in Malawi. By EDWIN DEAN. Amsterdam: North-Holland Publishing Company, I966. Pp. xiv, 174, map. G 25. 50S. $7.00. THE applicability of economic theory to African producers, and others who still live in tradition-bound societies, is an old argument to which this work makes a notable contribu- tion. It is remarkable in being one of the few attempts, and one of the most thorough, to apply statistical techniques to the problem of such producers' responses to price changes. This approach is often discouraged or prohibited by the paucity or uncertainty of the data. The title, however, is somewhat misleading, since the study is confined to detailed exam- ination of a single case, tobacco production by Africans on trust land in Malawi. In this case the statistical data, though incomplete, cover a longer time period and are more reliable than those relating to most African cash crops. The author starts with the hypothesis that these tobacco producers respond to price changes in an ' orthodox ' manner; that is, in accordance with the expectations of economic theory. He tests this hypothesis by regression analysis of the data, taking tobacco production as the dependent variable and the probable determinants as independent variables. These probable determinants are the potential producer's expectations regarding the price for tobacco, the rates of return to alternative uses of resources (migrant labour wages), and the price level of the cash goods he buys. The case is proved. The statistical results are consistent with the hypotheses, and with the prediction that the level of tobacco output is determined by the levels of the independent variables. When returns from tobacco rise or fall, relative to wage-rates abroad, more or less labour is allocated to its production and fewer or more prospective growers seek work in South Africa and Rhodesia. Thus, wage-rates in these countries influence the number of growers and the total output of tobacco, but not the production per grower. There has, however, been a strong upward trend in total tobacco output and in production per grower which is not accounted for by the price and wage variables. This is explained by increased productivity and greater incentives, due respec- tively to technological improvements and growing preferences for and greater availability of European consumer goods. This explanation too is consistent with economic theory. All of this is convincing enough but the author's attempt to generalize his findings is less convincing. It seems unlikely that students will be induced to withdraw completely 'their endorsement of the target worker concept and the backward bending labour supply curve'. The concept of the 'target worker' was intended to apply to migrant workers whose home commitments limit the time they can spend in employment abroad. Such workers, and in certain situations cash-crop producers also, may be willing to sacrifice</page></plain_text>
