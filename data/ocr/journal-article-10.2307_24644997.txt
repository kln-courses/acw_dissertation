Visitors to Egyptian temples, particularly Edfu and Dendera, cannot fail to notice the leonine gargoyles perched in the upper registers of the exterior walls. Some might even ponder whether the Egyptian sculptures influenced the architectural guardians adorning later European cathedrals, or note that in Modern Persian, coincidentally, the word shir means both 'water faucet' and 'lion'. The present book does not discuss such tangential questions, but it does thoroughly investigate the form, function, and theological significance of gargoyles in ancient Egypt. This book, an expansion of a 2010 dissertation submitted at Tubingen, is the first independent publication by the author, but scholars will recognize the name from contributions to various studies by Christian Leitz (notably the Lexikon der àgyptischen Gotter und Gotterbezeichnnngen) and the late Philippe Derchain. An expert in Graeco-Roman religious texts and member of the research team 'Der Tempel als Kanon der religiôsen Literatur Agyptens', the author is excellently qualified to translate and interpret the detailed inscriptions and representations accompanying these lions. Yet while the majority of this book is devoted to texts, the author also pays great attention to architectural context, religious symbolism, and above all the natural phenomena described in this corpus. The book opens with a comprehensive overview of precipitation and storms in ancient Egypt. In the following chapter, the author describes the technical aspects of all known gargoyles in Egyptian temples, from the Old Kingdom through to the Roman Period,1 contextualizing these lions among other architectural mechanisms designed to facilitate drainage and prevent water damage to the painted reliefs, wooden furniture, and other valuable materials kept within the temples. Towards the end of the book, the author analyzes the epithets occurring in this corpus as careful observations of lions To this catalog, one should also add two leonine statues subsequently discovered at Dime (Sokonopaios), one of which is certainly a gargoyle: &lt;http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/9/4i/59724/Heritage/ GrecoRoman/Lionshaped-statues-unearthed-in-Fayoum.aspx&gt; accessed 21.01.2013.</page><page sequence="2">20I4 REVIEWS 531 and their behaviors, following similar studies by Philippe Derchain, Christian Leitz, and Christophe Thiers. Beyond these disparate subjects, the concluding chapters focus on the theological significance of rain, gargoyles, and apotropaic lions in general. According to the texts from this corpus, the author concludes that rain had a primarily negative connotation in Egypt, closely associated with non-Nilotic regions such as Syria-Palestine, which depended on rainfall for sustenance. As such, precipitation upon temples was likened to foreign invasions, aggressively descending upon the temple roofs. Perched above the temple roofs, the defensive cadres of lion-gargoyles would figuratively devour these 'enemies' and spit out 'blood and gore' onto the ground outside the perimeter. Related to this theme, one might also compare a recent article on ritual purity in the temple.2 Since rain falls upon the temple's firmament decorated with astronomic figurations, it sullies the celestial purity emphasized in numerous hymns, threatening the solar cycle.3 While the relevant texts dwell heavily on the destruction of enemies, they simultaneously laud the benefits of the proper Egyptian inundation (Hapi), presenting a yin-yang view of water and flooding. Despite the prominence of this dualistic theme, the author downplays any conceptual links between equatorial rainfall and the inundation (pp. 10-15, 218-23), at least in the corpus under discussion. Yet while the author mentions a study of texts 'vom AR bis zum NR' and the testimony of ancient authors, no mention is made of the multiple texts from the Twenty-Fifth and -Sixth Dynasties (e.g. Kawa V, Defenna Stela) that clearly attribute beneficial inundations in Egypt to rain in Nubia (Ta Sety) or Punt.4 The core of the book (pp. 55-188) analyzes the distribution, decoration, and, most importantly, the inscriptions on the extant gargoyles of the Graeco-Roman Period. At first glance, the texts may seem formulaic and repetitive, and indeed they are; many close parallels can be drawn, even between gargoyles at different temples (discussed in detail, pp. 195-6, 202-4). Generally, the lions relate how they attack, maim, kill, devour, and spit out enemies, often employing assonance or other wordplay. The lions represent masculine pendants to the apotropaic female uraei that traditionally surrounded shrines and temples. Nonetheless, the inscriptions also feature unexpected challenges, from cryptographic tableaus (pp. 62, 67, 73), confusing palimpsests (p. 121), obscure zodiacal-astrological allusions (p. 176) to various lexicographic puzzles. Readers may be surprised by the frequent references to the hours of the day and night (pp. 116-17),5 or picturesque language resembling J. R. R. Tolkien or George R. R. Martin (e.g. p. 154 = Edfou IV, 111, 8-10): Turn back (from) the Chapel of the Child, [rebel], enemy or ghost! It is a dangerous journey, its roads are made of snakes, all (its) paths are made of brambles, its branches can kill, its roots prick, and its thorns pierce through to the bones! Overall, the translations are convincing and the commentary is reliable. In the textual notes, the author meticulously justifies even the smallest restorations or emendations, and often invokes parallels from within the gargoyle corpus. The texts have all been collated, usually based on archival photographs. For lexicographic or philological questions; however, the notes generally restrict themselves to the most relevant reference works ( Wb; LGG; P. Wilson, A Ptolemaic Lexikon; D. Kurth, Einfiihrung ins Ptolemàische), whereas citations of comparative texts, even other temple inscriptions, appear only sporadically. Despite the formulaic nature of the gargoyle inscriptions, many grammatical and lexicographic challenges still remain, especially in the Roman-Period inscriptions recently published in Dendara XII.6 The following observations and suggestions should not detract from the considerable merits of this excellent book, as they only seek to improve upon some minor details.

(a): The author's translation (wnn.i rs rwt, 'Ich bin der Wachter der AuBenwand') is grammatically unlikely, here and in the other examples where it occurs (listed on p. 223, n. 112); for such a statement of identity, one would require the 'm of predication'. Instead, this could either be a pseudo-verbal construction (wnn=i (hr) rs), or a sdm—fiorm (wnn=i rs=i), with the second lion writing the first-person suffix-pronoun, as elsewhere in Dendera (p. 108) (cf. text D-8.b (p. 104): rs.i sk r hw.t, 'Ich wache iiber den TempeP). The other examples should be corrected accordingly (pp. 58, 63, 72, 78, 82, 83, 86, 102). Moreover, although the author interprets this epithet as a compound (rs-rwt, 'Naos-Wachter'), rs is usually intransitive, and the other texts from Dendera employ various prepositions after this verb (m [p. 63], m-hnt [p. 72], r [pp. 74, 78], hi [83, 86]), followed by a synonym for Dendera. The elaborate sign ( ) should thus represent a preposition (a possibility the author considered less 'sinnvoll' here, but accepted elsewhere: p. 75, n. 106), which one could transcribe in various ways (rwt, (r)-rwt, (hr)-rwt, (hr)-sl,'1 si), all meaning: 'on top of; outside of; in front of; around'. To read this sign as a substantive, one could restore: 'who watches (over) the roof (rs (hr) rw.t)', but this would differ syntactically from the similar texts mentioned above. p. 60, n. 31: ^ I Vk I (T P The author reads the group ( Q | | |) as scw.t, 'Kuchen', but notes that the context suggested understanding 'Pfianzen'. However, a parallel example (Dendara XII, 315, 7) uses the term iht, 'food; products', a word which appears elsewhere as: III* (Dendara XII, 321, 5; cf. p. 76). Similarly J. F. Quack, WdO 43/2 (2013), 254. p. 62: As the author discusses, Re and Chonsu must here write 'day and night (rr grh)', contrary to the conventional interpretation 'every day (rc rib)'.

(a), and 216: For the bird sign, the author argues against De Wit's proposal to recognize snm, 'to swallow up', preferring to read this phrase: hrw him nsny, 'am Tag des Fangens des Unwetters', an allusion to the gargoyle trapping the rain before it can damage the temple. Yet in the parallel formulations (conveniently gathered on pp. 213-14), the lions simply mention 'the Day of Bad Weather' (similar to the more common 'day of battle', Wb. II, 500, 9), not the apotropaic activities they perform on that day. Accordingly, one could retain De Wit's reasonable transliteration, but translate differently: hrw snm nsnj, 'the Day of the Raging Storm', an intensified variant of the more frequent: hrw snm, 'the Day of the Storm' (see pp. 213, 216). The supposed verbal example that the author mentions (p. 216) can be read differently (cf. infra, note on p. 154). ***** „ xy .. p-8o: fLin. Rather than 'desgleichen es nicht gibt bei der Schopfung der Seienden (iwty sn.nwj hr ms.t ntyw)', this * 8 appears to be the rare term msnty.w, 'foundations (of the earth)' or 'fertile ground'. Thus: 'without his peer upon the entire earth (hr msnty)'. Another example of this word occurs in Dendara XII, 90, 5, with the same determinative. p. 80, n. 134: The author proposes various readings for the nursing woman (lt.t, mnc.t, hnm.t), but for purposes of alliteration, one might also suggest sd.t: 'the august one who nourishes plants (sps.t sd.t sny.w-tl)'. p. 84, n. 145: For more Roman-Period examples of the verb pnq, 'to nourish', see S.

(a): The author tentatively suggests reading this as Belt, 'Not, Mangel, Unheil', but one would expect a final dental for that word. Alternatively, this could be the nearly synonymous iw/lw, 'calamity' (Wb. I, 45, 8-10), which can also employ the pustule determinative (e.g. Edfou VIII, 145, 3), or less likely, the similarly written iwty.w, 'putrefaction' (Wb. I, 48, 15). PP- 9i, 135: This passage finds an almost exact parallel at Edfu. For the Dendera version, the author reads: wnm.i st Imw m ibwt nbt nt nbd: 'Ich fresse sie, (namlich) die, die verbrannt sind in jeder Gestalt des Bosartigen'. However, the direct pronoun (st) should not precede the noun to which it refers {&gt;m.w\ cf. Gardiner, EG, §507, 1). Accordingly, the referent should occur before the pronoun, as follows: I am a lion whose face is flame and whose eyes are fire. As for ( )9 any enemies I have found in my path, I eat them {wnm=i st), they being burnt {im.w; stative) in every image of the Rebel. The object is placed in anteposition here because of its complexity {sbi.w gm.n=i m ri-w3.t=i), as in other Ptolemaic texts.10 p. 93, n. c: This phrase modifies a formulaic description of the king providing food to the temple. The author emends the first group to , obtaining an unlikely variant of &gt; SP fdw&gt; 'viermal'. Yet the cat hieroglyph, with its distinctively shorter face and ears, is clearly discernible in the published photograph {Dendara XII, pi. 219). Furthermore, gods usually receive food three times a day, 1 whereas hymns and spells are recited 'four times {zp-fdw)', once for each cardinal direction. One can thus translate this group without emendation: zp-hmtmi rr-nb, 'three times every day'. For the fixed expression: mi rc-nb, see Wb. II, 38, 5. p. 95, n. (a): The author asserts 'Das intransitive Verbpr muss dem Zusammenhang nach eine kausative Bedeutung haben', and thus translates: 'Er lasst die Flammende ... hervorkommen {pr.n.fNby.t)'. However, since the causative meaning is not common for the verb pri, 'to come forth',12 and since this statement is preceded and followed by participles, this is more likely a relative construction:13 pr{.w) n=f Nby.t r-gs ich hnt ti-n-tm, 'He for whom the Flaming-One (Tefnut) comes out (of exile back) into the Land of Atum (Dendera) beside the moon (Thoth)'. The author correctly recognizes the reference to the Wandering Goddess: the gargoyle embodies Shu-Onuris, the warrior lion whose qualities Thoth praises in order to entice Tefnut back to Egypt. p-IOO: ojfOi'isabsir-D Read: 'he who produces its products for her (Hathor), in order to provision the storage-magazine (r sps sn^)','4 rather than 'fiir (?) die Kostlichkeiten des Magazins {r spsxv snr)'. p. 139, n. c: The author correctly suggests reading this group hr.tw, 'one says', but notes the unusual spelling of hr. The first circle is probably a mistake for @ , the determinative one would expect after he preceding toponym (Bw-bhn-hftyw), just as in the preceding mention of S.t-wnp {Edfou IV, 264, 4). For this spelling of the particle ir, see D.

While this particular nuance of kip is attested elsewhere (Wb. V, 104, 16), the interpretation of n hry.t=f (fbecause (he is aware) of his own terror') is unconvincing. Rather, this epithet seems to express the fear lions inspire in humans and animals alike (Wb. V, 104, 14-15; cf. also p. 235 for similar epithets). Thus: nw (hr) kip n hry.t=f 'the hunter hides himself out of terror for him (the lion)'. In both instances, the texts describe the lion prowling through desert regions, so an allusion to terrified human scouts is fitting. 1 1 p. 159, n. 147 : ^ The author transcribes this toponym as mn nb and suggests it could be a designation for Edfu.

However, a nfr hr construction after a sdm=f statement would be a syntactical non sequitur. To connect the clauses logically, one must supply a first person suffix pronoun, either following rnw?,r8 or more likely as a sdm=f verbal form, creating a Wechselsatz: Just as I sharpen (my) knife against the enem(ies) of your Majesty, so do (I) scratch (my) claws (ihr(—i) rnw.t (=/)) in their hide. The same observation applies to the parallel texts (pp. 157, 160) and other passages at Edfu: pp. 151 and 155 (spd=i (...) nhd(=i)...rs(=i)). For a good example of a Wechselsatz in this corpus, see p. 156 (Edfou IV, 131, 1: nh=i (...) mk=i (...), 'Just as I guard (...), so do I protect (...)'. pp. 153, n.

Since the other gargoyle inscriptions predominantly employ active participles or verbal forms, one might parse this entire section differently: I am the great guardian who removes rain, who sends (it) to the ground during a storm (rdi r ti hft znm), who throws down the fierce rain (shr znm nsny) on the day of storm in the sky. 15 J.

However, the text seems to imply that both astrological events (heliacal rise of Sothis, sun entering Leo) occurred in the same month of Epiphi, something which never occurred under Augustus or his sucessors, but which may have been possible under the late Ptolemies, due to the wandering calendar. In this scenario, the text would have been composed earlier, only to be inscribed, anachronistically, under Augustus. Although it is true that Sothis typically rose while the sun was in Cancer (noted by the author, p. 178), the Inundation only arrived later under Leo. This phenomenon finds an excellent illustration in the circular zodiac at Dendera, where Isis-Sothis (a celestial cow) appears under Cancer, but Satet sits under Leo holding two vases of inundation water.25 This interesting astrological coincidence may simply be an astute observation by Philae scribes, but it could also reflect deeper conceptual links between lion-gargoyles and the Inundation, at least in the Graeco-Roman Period when the zodiac was fully integrated into Egyptian temple decoration. p. 179, n.

Nonetheless, the author does not mention the similar verb qnh, 'to become dark'.28 Although the determinative would be unusual at Philae, one could translate instead: nn qd qnh.tw hr knh, 'never sleeping (even when) it grows dark upon the temple'.

At Hibis, 111 r , the latter sign appears to be an elaboration of the more common thn-sign ( ^ ) as it occurs elsewhere in that temple (Hibis III, pi. 32, upper left, cols 3 and 4).30 Both examples may relate to the Egyptian conception that the 'heads' (tp.w) of stars are the observable luminaries in the night sky.31 pp. 229-31:/?:i , o C.^c; Based on certain variants in this corpus ( &lt;?w" ' ) , the author proposes a new reading for this lion word, namely tqr, 'der Starke(?),' to which one may raise various objections. First, the egg would have the phonetic value q (or k, g), otherwise only attested in the divine name Geb ( ^jj^j); but there it sportively substitutes for the standard goose, and does not have the unilateral value g. Furthermore, the author did not consider spellings from outside the corpus, where the first element is clearly spelled: r (Edfou IV, 342, 12; 354, 4; VII, 319, 14; 323, 5).32 Dieter Kurth recently discussed these lion words again, distinguishing between 8-m-rw ( *^33^ ), 'young lion,' (not t&gt;m) and tim/tmw I ^y: )• One wonders if either word might record the same Semitic term preserved in Arabic: dirgam, 'lion'.33 The throw-stick ( ) that occurs in two examples (Edfou IV, 117, 9, bis) could indicate the foreign origin or serve as a phonetic complement (Jan, km, gm). In this list of gargoyle names (pp. 224-31), the author does not mention another term, nrs ( ), used substantially twice at Philae (pp. 183, 187).34 Rather than simply translating 'der Starke , the determinative suggests comparison with the most common Akkadian word for lion: nesu (CAD 11, N/2, 193-7), most likely the origin of Late Egyptian ncs, 'strong', an adjective that frequently describes lions.35 The incorporation of foreign loanwords for 'lion' would reflect the animal's geographic distribution in Syria, Nubia and the deserts (cf. p. 236), and emphasize Egypt's dominance over all those regions. p. 242: The term hkn/hkn.t, 'lion-shaped door-bolt' ('kommt erst in ptolemaischer Zeit'), occurs already on the striding statue MMA 1996.91 (Thirtieth Dynasty), where the owner holds the remarkable title: 'priest of the door-bolt (hkn.t) of the Great Portal of Busiris'.36 This latter office, along with the similar 'priest of the lion-shaped door-bolts (qrr.wt)',37 reveal that these apotropaic lions were considered independent divinities (cf. p. 250), who may have enjoyed cultic services such as food or incense offerings. David Klotz 30 The cryptographic text is difficult, but the surrounding passage appears to be an epithet of Amun: 'he who enters within Thebes, with the result that its entire circuit scintillates (thn) by means of the fire of his eye (rq m-hnt Wls.t, thn sny.t=s m nbi.t n ir.t=f)'. A new study of the enigmatic texts is in preparation by the reviewer. 31 For the importance of stars' heads in the 'Book of Nut', cf. von Lieven, Grundriss des Laufes der Sterne, 88-92, 168. For anthropomorphic stars in general, one might also compare the inverted stars in the tomb of Ramesses IX: J.C. Darnell, The Enigmatic Netherworld Books of the Solar-Osirian Unity (OBO 190; Fribourg, Gottingen, 2004), 280, n. 28 (comparing them to the Hibis figure), pi. 32. 32 Collected by C. de Wit, 'Some Values of Ptolemaic Signs', BIFAO 55 (1955), in; Wilson, A Ptolemaic Lexikon, 1159. 33 H. Wehr, Arabic-English Dictionary, 632; E.W. Lane, An Arabic-English Lexicon, I, 1788. For the phonetic change from tlm &gt; trm, cf. J. C. Darnell, 'XCOPM', 'to Train', and 'Timy.t', 'the Bit', Enchoria 24 (1997/98), 159-61. 34 Cf. Wb. II, 209, 22: 'als Beiname des lowengestaltigen Wasserspeiers'. 35 Wb. II, 209, 13, 19-20. J. E. Hoch dismissed any connection between the two words because of the 'ayin which only occurs in Egyptian (Semitic Words in Egyptian Texts of the New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period [Princeton, 1994], 183-4), a curious objection since Akkadian never writes 'ayin (cf. Egyptian: brr, 'Ba'al', vs. Akkadian: belu, 'lord'); D. Meeks, meanwhile, argued for an inner-Egyptian etymology from the rare tern nrh/nrh (BiOr 54 [1997], 44).
