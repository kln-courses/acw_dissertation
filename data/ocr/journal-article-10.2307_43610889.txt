<plain_text><page sequence="1">Avatars and Robots The Imaginary Present and the Socialities of the Inorganic Henrietta L Moore, University of Cambridge This paper explores the frailty of particular notions of 'actanť and 'affecť for an understanding of the emergent socialities that cross virtual and actual worlds. It uses work on robots and avatars to explore a humanly grounded theory of sociality. It discusses the virtual character of selves and social relations, and how forms of presence apparent in robotics and virtual worlds both enhance and augment our understanding of specifically human forms of sociality. It suggests that critiques of subject-object dualisms do not depend on a rejection of the distinctiveness of anthropos.

These ideas are most often a combination of periodizations with their attendant forms of progression, underpinned by organizing concepts which form the basis for models and guide critical thought by acting as quasi-organizing principles for certain pre-theoretical assumptions (Moore 2004). Where once we spoke of dialectics and structures of society and mind, we have now largely eschewed the world of scaffolded representations to embrace the digital, bio-informatic age where all talk is of potentialities, emergent properties, forms of becoming and modes of attachment and affect (e.g., Braidotti 2006; Thrift 2008; Bennett 2010; Connolly 2011). In this important and beguiling moment, questions of immense interest are thrown out as challenges: is agency restricted to humans; can we speak of cellular subjectivities; is social change the product of vital forces largely outside of human control (e.g., Deleuze and Guattari 1987; Massumi 2002; Latour 2004, 2005; Coole and Frost 2010)? Two developments seem particularly salient. The first is the way that changing technologies enable new forms of data which are then turned into meaningful information through the application of new metaphors. These metaphors, in their turn, change the character of our objects of enquiry, our approaches to them, and WĚ Cambridge Anthropology 30( 1), Spring 2012: 48-63 © Cambridge Anthropology doi: 1 0.3 1 67/CO.20 1 2.300 1 06</page><page sequence="2">The Imaginary Present and the Socialities of the Inorganic the way we think about them. Once we assign scallops agency (Callón 1986) and claim to be able to hear yeast cells scream (Roosth 2009), it is inevitable that we see new connections, ask alternative questions. However, metaphors do not necessarily characterize the way the world is, but rather how we choose to talk about it. In the eighteenth century we fantasized about men as machines, and in the twenty-first we take a different tack and speak of assorted connections between humans and non- humans with novel propensities. Methodological and theoretical approaches redefine our objects of enquiry. One element in recent developments that illustrates this point well is how the boundaries between the human and the non-human are being breached - some would argue erased - through the extension of agency to non-human animals and to inanimate objects. In anthropology, the larger project of criticizing subject- object dualisms has perhaps been most salient in approaches to material things that argue against privileging language and representation, and seek instead to explore the intelligence of non-human actants (e.g., Miller 2005; Henare et al. 2007). The dominant inspiration here is Latour, and Actor-Network Theory (ANT) more generally. The result is a series of interrogations about the category human, and its relation to, and difference from, the non-human: For the thing we are looking for is not a human thing, nor is it an inhuman thing. It offers, rather a continuous passage, a commerce, an interchange between what humans inscribe in it and what it prescribes to humans. It translates the one into the other. The thing is the nonhuman version of the people, it is the human version of things, twice displaced. What should it be called? Neither object nor subject. An instituted object, quasi-object, quasi- subject, a thing that possesses body and soul indissolubly. (Latour 1996: 23) More broadly, however, such interrogations reconfigure the relation of humans to the natural world and to other living things, where embodiment involves a generative capacity as opposed to a finished form: Behaviour can no longer be localized in individuals conceived as preformed homunculi; but has to be treated epigenetically as a function of complex material systems which cut across individuals (assemblages) and which transverse phyletic lineages and organismic boundaries (rhizomes). This requires the articulation of a distributed conception of agency. The challenge is to show that nature consists of a field of multiplicities, assemblages of heterogeneous components (human, animal, viral, molecular etc) in which creative evolution' can be shown to involve blocks of becoming. (Ansell Pearson 1999: 171) A focus on the agency of human and non-human actors in hybrid networks has in its turn stimulated ideas both about context and environment, and about interrelations and affects. Our worlds are full of encounters - moments of co-presence, affect and contagion - that involve many things that are non-human. The relational connection and movement between things conjoins with ideas about intensity and potentiality. The cornerstone in this approach is matters capacity for self-organization: the potentiality of form that works through sets of intensities that come before, but are only realized in specific encounters between the human and the non-human, life and matter. As Massumi would have it: Affect is as good a general term as any for the interface between Cambridge Anthropology • 49</page><page sequence="3">Henrietta L Moore implicate and explicate order (Massumi 2002: 37). The movement of affect is always indeterminate, vital, open to new possibilities, part of a series of potentialities that continually generate differences and divergences in what becomes actual. Affect as a term, and as an analytic concept, has diverse philosophical and disciplinary roots. But perhaps what is most significant about what has been called the affective turn is that it wishes to inaugurate not just new theories, but new ontologies (Moore 2011: 170-205). At the present time, fields as apparently disparate as genetics, the biological sciences, astrophysics, neuroscience, narrative analysis, philosophy, media, informatics and cultural theory are all animated by the possibility of a common ontology that would link the social and the natural, the rational and the affective. The models and pre-theoretical commitments of this emerging ontology are grounded in ideas such as becoming, assemblage, relationality, autopoiesis, information and differentiation, its vitalism inhering in cellular capacities for replication. The resultant impact is not just on our understanding of the category human, but also on the more fundamental issue of life itself. We have been used to thinking of the category human, and the notion of life, as foundational in the sense that they are conceived of as natural kinds. But, as the quest for new understandings of living things and life forms proceeds, we should recall that biology itself is not a natural kind and it has not always existed in its present form. As a grid of knowledge', it emerged in the eighteenth century (Foucault 1970: 139), and contemporary views of life are now overdetermined by the development of bio and information technologies that extract information and resources from bodies - human/non-human, organic/non-organic - and cast them into new frames. Life no longer has a single form or essence; it is not even necessarily the defining property of 'living' things (Helmreich 2011). Biological knowledge, biotechniques and biology 'itself' reshape each other. Life is changing as it gets remade, informatics have become constitutive of contemporary understandings of life and matter, and consequently the structure of our knowledge - its models, metaphors, frameworks - come more and more to resemble biological processes or 'life itself' (Moore 2011: 174). This has unhinged life from its self-evident manifestations, we are seduced by the realization that we do not know all the forms in which life might exist, and life has inexorably become something that can be abstracted from its forms (Helmreich 201 1: 682-683). The result is that human capacities are no longer contained within the human, and life is no longer a feature only of organic things. It is not surprising that how we think about the human is connected to how we think about life, but framings and classifications are always about politics. Politics, that is, in the sense of human purposes, and this is the second development that seems particularly salient. For example, when Donna Haraway (1991: 149-182) set out her cyborg manifesto, she envisioned a future when the cyborg's combination of the organic and the machinic would rupture the dichotomy between the human and the non- human, the natural and the artificial, and free the human subject from the imposed categories of biology, gender, and race. A developed version of that vision continues to underpin much recent work in feminist philosophy (e.g., Braidotti 2006; Colebrook 2010). Like Haraway, these theorists focus on an escape from the bounded individual body and/or subject, and on the opportunities provided by sets of new relations to transcend the human, and to build new kinds of networks and/or collectivities for 50 • Cambridge Anthropology</page><page sequence="4">The Imaginary Present and the Socialities of the Inorganic enhanced agency and cooperation across lines of culture, language, race, and gender, as well as across the human, non-human, post-human, and inhuman. The ethical good in the vision of humanity operationalized here resides in the notion of radical relationality. Humans are envisaged as being at one with their world, but need to enter into relations with multiple others. In this project, the 'minoritarian, the other-than, women, gays, ethnic and racialized others, the natural, animal and environmental others - all that has been excluded from the rational, humanist subject - are the site or locale of political transformation (Braidotti 2010: 46-47). The transcendence of social categorizations and sedimented lines of power is one that is given particular imaginative force by the adherence to metaphors drawn directly and indirectly from biology: replication, cellular generativity, vitality, the limitless alterity of life as a form of becoming. This then is a theory of humanity at a particular moment in history, a theory taking form within a certain politics, where the social is reimagined for particular human purposes in the idiom of biological processes. William Connolly sums it up well, when he declares that neuropolitics is all about attachment to the earth and care for a protean diversity of being that is never actualized completely in any particular cultural setting (2002: 197). Humanity, like life, is not a natural category, because our ontological categories are tied up with our representations, and regulatory ideals frame our descriptive and analytic languages (Moore 201 1). In a certain sense, and starting from a broad anthropology perspective, there is nothing new in any of this. The idea that humans are not the only things imbued with agency is a commonplace in many other cultures and philosophical systems where unstable connections between the human, the non-human and the inhuman can be equal sources of joy and concern. Anthropology has a large archive of communities of people whose ideas and beliefs extend the capacity for agency to non-human things and inhuman or post-human entities. In the 1940s, Maurice Leenhardt argued that the Canaque of New Caledonia regarded the person as being connected to other persons, both human and non-human, material and non-material (Leenhardt [1947] 1979), while Anne Strauss, for example, also suggested that for the Cheyenne the concept of the person extended beyond human beings to include other non-human persons (Strauss 1982: 124-125). Evidently, humanity has not always been synonymous with persons or agency, and humans are certainly not the only actants or agents shaping human/non-human relations. For example, in many contexts in Africa and Melanesia, artefacts are not just tools, but things that effect transformations through their agency. Constructions such as houses or the more famous Malanggan are regarded as extensions of bodies or persons, made up of parts of humans and animals, evidence (one might even say forms of mediated information) about the ways that bodies and things have affected each other in the world (e.g., Strathern 2001). In Latin America in recent years, new political actors have forced themselves onto the scene; these so- called earth-beings and/or earth-practices embody and enact the respect and the affect between humans and non-humans, including animals, plants and landscapes, that maintain the possibility of a life-world. The 'things' (forces of nature, sentient mountains, etc.) that are now being made public in this form of politics are not simply non-humans, but sentient beings whose existence is threatened by the intersections between capital and the state, such as mining (de la Cadena 2010: 341-342). As de Cambridge Anthropology • 5 1</page><page sequence="5">Henrietta L Moore la Cadena makes clear, the public emergence of such earth-beings upsets the locus of politics (2010: 343), because having been excluded historically from nation-state institutions, defined, and thus confined, as little more than cultural beliefs, they are now becoming significant political agents within the emergence of a regional indigenous politics that both interacts with and makes claims upon the nation-state (Moore 2012). The decentring of the human subject and the notions of actant and aifect in some ways hold no surprises, so why has contemporary anthropology turned to ANT, biology and informatics to re-theorize ideas about materiality, humanity, sociality and life, rather than to its own resources? There are perhaps two reflections that might be relevant here. Its easy to comprehend that our accounts of what life or humanity are or could be are necessarily bound up with the stories we want or feel compelled to tell, but in the present moment those narratives have been both amplified and destabilized by the development of new bio and information technologies which provide new means of seeing and imagining, new ways of visualizing and recording the interiors of bodies and other spaces, and subsequently of categorizing and re-categorizing the information we uncover (Latour 2010). In this sense, new reproductive technologies, biology, evolutionary models, informatics have all been good to think with, they have enlarged our imaginations, provided new metaphors, reinvigorated our objects of study. This in itself is seductive, and most probably we find it particularly alluring because ideas about aifect, oneness with the natural world, idioms of the shared planet, and the emancipatory pull of theories that privilege affective dispositions over rationalist thinking, are in tune with politics of the moment (Moore 2011: 170-205). The second reflection, however, concerns the appeal of moving definitely away from dominant models of language, signification and representation, where the postmodern transmogrifies into the post- human (Hemmings 2005; Leys 2011). The importance of human engagement with a world of non-humans, both organic and inorganic, cannot be overstated (see below), and key to these engagements is the body, as well as emotions and affects. Certainly, what is attractive about theories of affect is their attention to somatic experiences and forms of communication that are outside or below linguistic registers, their insistence on how bodies stay in touch with other bodies and attuned to the many others who people the material worlds humans inhabit and share with others (Moore 2011: 180). But affect in the work of many writers is held to be prior to and external to all social meaning. Massumi defines it as both Trreducibly bodily and autonomic' (Massumi 2002: 28), and Barnett describes it as a form of practical attunement to a lived world that is autonomous of propositional intentionality (2008: 188-189). It is the autonomy of affect, its ceaseless escape, that is the guarantee of both its vitality and its changeability (Massumi 2002: 35). Social constructionism and the humanist subject now seem arrogant intellectual formulations/preoccupations, and suddenly we have a problem with anthropos being the centre of our world. The long history in anthropology of the critique of the subject-object distinction, and its immense archive of empirical data notwithstanding, we have slid away from the notion of others who are rational in context' since we no longer wish to make them or us the centre of explanation. While babies and bathwater come to mind, as has been cogently pointed out (Navaro-Yashin 2009), it seems impossible to resist the move away from social determinism towards 52 • Cambridge Anthropology</page><page sequence="6">The Imaginary Present and the Socialities of the Inorganic the decentred freedom of affect, where the vitality of affect is confused with freedom itself (Moore 2011: 182). What Can we Learn from Robots and Avatars? I suggest that turning afresh to the notion of sociality is a productive way to consider what we might know about being human and being alive. One starting point for a renewed theory of sociality would be to ask ourselves what we have learnt about human sociality from the general gamut of theories of affect, co-presence, networks and assemblages. Is there something about a focus on anthropos that still requires a genuine anthropology? It may seem counterintuitive, but starting with robots and avatars is useful because it allows us to begin an enquiry without necessarily assuming a divide between the human and the non-human, the organic and the inorganic. Robotics is an especially provocative terrain because many of its practitioners believe that building robots tells us something both about how humans function, and also about what makes them distinctive. What is evident is that at the present time new personal relations are arising between humans and robots. New generations of robots, rather than being designed to replace humans - for example, by assembling cars or packing food in a factory - are being designed specifically to interact with humans, and to perform human tasks such as caring for children and the elderly, performing domestic tasks and providing companionship. Japan is the largest producer of robots in the world, and according to Jennifer Robertson there is already an established market for "intelligent," autonomous humanoid robots that can: operate power shovels and forklifts (Enryuu), patrol premises and extinguish fires (ReBorg-Q, Guardrobo Dl), replace human service sector employees (Actroid, Asimo), babysit and tutor children (PaPeRo, Wakamaru), housesit (Nuvo), nurse the infirm and elderly (Ri-man), provide companionship and entertainment (ifbot, Pino, Posy, Robovie), and even provide sex (Kaori)' (Robertson 2007: 372-373; see also Sabanovic 2010). What is perhaps equally surprising is that robots and humans are co-developing in new ways. For example, Noby, short for 'nine-month-old baby', looks and feels like a human baby, with soft urethane skin and flexible joints. Developed by Yasuo Kuniyoshi and his team at Osaka University, Noby is powered by a powerful computer, and has 600 body sensors to feel touch, and cameras and microphones for vision and hearing. Research on child development enabled Noby s creation, but now researchers are using Noby to test theories of human development (e.g., Cowley and MacDorman 2006; Demiris and Meltzoff 2008).2 We make the world as the world makes us. Modern robots have to be designed to operate - not just function - in changing human societies. Key to this process is the question of embodiment. Both humans and robots are enabled and constrained by their particular morphologies. Physical constraints shape the dynamics of interactions between the embodied system and its environment; linked sensorimotor activity and body morphology (shapes of body and limbs, placement of sensors/organs) induces statistical regularities in sensory input and prioception. Biological systems respond to their environments and continuously improve their capabilities. There is a continuous and dynamic interplay of physical and information processes. Robotic engineers have taken inspiration from many Cambridge Anthropology • 53</page><page sequence="7">Henrietta L Moore biological systems - insects, lobsters, slime mould, salamanders, mice, dogs, monkeys, and human beings - in their quest to develop autonomous, self-organizing robots (Lindblom and Ziemke 2006; Pfeifer et al. 2007: 1088). One result is that many robots that need to operate in human environments and interact with humans have a human or anthropomorphic morphology. Yet humanoid resemblance is not quite enough (Lindblom and Ziemke 2006: 334). Real world contexts are uncertain and contingent, and while human embodiment actively promotes intelligent information processing for human purposes because sensorimotor coordination working alongside a specific body morphology shapes the resulting information structure, it does so in the context of the specific way in which human bodies and brains construct themselves into persons by attuning to patterns and norms in their social environment. Body and brain co-evolve. Designing a robot that can do this is difficult for many reasons, but one is that social context or environment cannot be predefined, it emerges from interaction. This is why humans are so good at sensing - often without conscious thought - the feelings of others, or how to orient themselves in a particular context. Affect and emotion laid down through experience and interaction can precede conscious thought, as Damasio suggests (1994, 1999). Yet humans do more than simply react to social environments; they have biologically evolved capacities for linking affect to higher order cognitive states, and they can change and reflect on their cognitive states, as well as use others as cognitive resources to develop their capacities. One of the major challenges for social robotics is how to design a control architecture that can adapt in order to benefit from other agents knowledge. Human babies develop these capacities long before they can talk. Touch, affect, and the carer s use of cultural values or norms prompts the infant to orient to what they value. Language use shapes adult interactions and so infants are immersed in a world of language before they can speak. The intersubjective nature of human sociality is built up through these processes; affect, emotion and touch play key roles where adults and others prompt infants to develop sensorimotor patterns and neurologically and biologically based routines that scaffold on intersubjective interaction, and they do so by drawing on cultural values and norms (Cowley et al. 2004; Cowley and MacDorman 2006; Cowley 2007). Human babies use affect to orient themselves to caregivers who respond by using verbal, vocal, tactile and expressive means. Certain patterns of behaviour become associated with affect and with visual and vocal stimuli that the baby later recognizes as symbols that are consistent, and around which the child can begin to organize actions and interactions with others. Human socialization is based on affective, neurological and biological development, but in ways that allow humans to augment their bodily and cognitive capacities. Biology becomes enmeshed with social life.3 Human cognition and intelligence are not just embodied, but become embodied within a biologically cultural body (Enfield and Levison 2006). This formulation takes us well beyond theories of affect, and indeed phenomenology, as they are usually deployed in the humanities and social sciences. What robotics demonstrates - perhaps unsurprisingly - is that human sociality as an emergent property of the interaction of biologically cultural bodies is foundational to social life and cognition. Humans are acutely aware of social and cultural norms, they identify with their conspecifics more deeply than other non-human primates do. The human child has a biologically inherited capacity for living culturally. One crucial 54 • Cambridge Anthropology</page><page sequence="8">The Imaginary Present and the Socialities of the Inorganic difference between human infants and other non-human animals is 'the capacity to 'tune in to others and to get others to tune into them (Lindblom and Ziemke 2006: 336). These capacities - part empathy and part discernment of motivation and intention - are developed intersubjectively, and are then gradually elaborated and ultimately form the basis for further coordination and communication. According to Tomasello (1999) only humans are able to understand other persons as intentional agents like themselves, and to use intentionality as a means of augmenting the capacity for changing both their cognitive states and the world. Key to this is that humans strategize, but also that they develop and share with others ways of paying attention to the world, and learn how to do this partly by interactive imitation, and the result is a unique human ability to identify with others and their objectives and desires. If the ability to orient action to another s mental state is, as many now suggest, the defining feature of human sociality and cognition then clearly affect theories founded on cellular reproduction and/or swarms in nature are too thin to serve as adequate models for human sociality, and by extension human agency. This would apply also to those theoretical formulations that simply define sociality as a by-product or outcome of co-presence or interaction because to be powerful those theories would need to explain how and why affect links to intention and agency. ANT, with its emphasis on distributed forms of agency and actants (human and non-human) in assemblages returns us forcibly and profitably to a focus on the material world and to larger concerns with context and environment. When allied to general theories of affect, these ideas are persuasive because of their focus on emotion, embodiment, vitality and the movement of affect, but where their purchase is fragile is in understanding how and why human sociality - underpinned as it necessarily must be by affect - is nonetheless distinctive. There is a certain irony in the fact that it is those who make robots who should have most persuasively and powerfully found a means to understand how higher order cognition and values are linked to biological systems, neurological structures and affect in ways that are humanly distinctive. One of the important aspects of this argument is to understand that affect is not autonomous in the way that Massumi (2002) and other theorists suggest. Cellular replication, vitality, life itself are processes that are constitutive of the human and non- human worlds, but biological systems are constituted as much through structures and hierarchies as they are through ceaseless vitality, and this is because they are emergent systems that develop in specific environments. Ants are well organized and live in large colonies, but it would be a mistake to imagine that their actions within their pheronomically constructed universe can best be explained by appeal to autonomous forms of affect. In much of the literature on affect, as explained earlier, its so-called autonomous character is held to be a consequence of the fact that emotion and affective processes occur independently of intention and meaning. Affect and cognition are held to be separate realms, with affect connecting to or operating, in the view of many, processes that are prior to language. However, work on animals demonstrates that affect and cognition are not separate realms. In humans, what binds them together is first that within a social world or environment affect is developmentally connected to language, norms and values from the earliest interactions of neonates and carers, and second that learning and the struggle for representation is productive of affect (Leys 2011: 122). Cambridge Anthropology • 55</page><page sequence="9">Henrietta L Moore Affect can potentially attach all over the place within a particular environment, but within human environments it does not do so randomly (Hemmings 2005; Navaro- Yashin 2009). Humans assign meaning to values, spaces, actions, gestures, objects, etc., and human environments are touched and formed through specific forms of human agency which can be recalled, reflected on and reinterpreted (Venn 2010). This does not mean that all affect is under human control, far from it, but it does mean that human patterns of intersubjective interaction assign values and meaning iteratively to patterns of affective response within particular environments, and so while affect may surprise, it equally often serves to drive and satisfy social norms, meanings and desires (Hemmings 2005: 559-562). Affect and its structured precision (Hemmings 2005: 562) are part of what makes a human body biologically cultural. In short, symbol recognition and manipulation emerge out of the childs history of coordinating and interacting with others; they are intersubjectively produced. In this process caregivers get babies to attend to particular aspects of the environment, and action-guided representations affect the developing brain. Certain patterns of behaviour are prompted and learned, then become salient and are saturated with affect. Over time, children learn to reflect on words and objects and stabilize their value, and this leads finally to speech-mediated communication and then context-free conversation (MacDorman 2007). Cowley (2007) argues that by four months, babies begin to use cultural capacities in response to caregiver wants (e.g., shut up!). Body-world interaction and sensorimotor coordination thus develop alongside social skills. The growing use of action regulated by social convention extends action-guided symbols. The infant observes - and begins to mimic - the fact that adults use gestures, voice, words and gaze to stand in for action, for things in the world, and for the intentions and motivations of others: as for example, when an adult shakes their head at a child to prevent them from performing a certain action. Gradually the infant learns to use action and symbols to get others to do things, and to get them to respond in particular ways. Consequently, infants develop styles of autonomy and agency that depend on value-guided actions accompanied by affect. The developing brain and neural systems of the infant become sensitized to arbitrary forms of signalling which incorporate cultural norms and expectations. Extraordinarily, human babies are able to exploit cultural signals and values even before they are capable of acting in self-directing ways (Cowley 2007). Infants at this stage do not understand language, leave alone cultural values or propositions, in the way that adults can, but are aligning themselves through mimetic action and affect to caregiver responses and demands. The result of this process of biological development through learning is an increasingly integrated neural system, body and brain that are closely attuned both to affect and to culture. Symbol systems as they are slowly acquired both stand in for aspects of the world, and also allow for recategorization of the environment and other peoples motivations and responses. Cognition and affect are bound together, and while sensorimotor skills and patterned perceptions allow humans to automate many tasks and responses so that they do not necessarily have to be thought about consciously, enabling us to act before we think, it is also the case that higher order cognitive tasks are scaffolded upon lower order ones. One of the things that is distinctive about human sociality is the way that humans use representation and signification to coordinate conscious and unconscious 56 • Cambridge Anthropology</page><page sequence="10">The Imaginary Present and the Socialities of the Inorganic knowledge, higher order cognition and affect. Both verbal thought and meaning become increasingly systematic, generative and internally coherent over developmental time, and this is quite likely a consequence of biologically cultural brains aligning us to symbol systems and cultural norms as part of the process of becoming a human person (MacDorman 2007: 145). It is also likely that our ability to use such things as symbols, metaphor, allegory is a consequence of the way conscious and unconscious thought interpenetrate and combine. Much depends - even in academic life - on that fleeting sense of a connection, something half glimpsed, 'a sense sublime of something far more deeply interfused'.4 The presumption that we are biologically - that is developmentally - cultural in no way vitiates cultural difference or distinctiveness, in fact it makes it essential to the process of becoming. Humans are world-oriented in a distinctive way, but symbol systems or cultural norms do not make persons in the way that cultural analysis has so often assumed - via some unspecified process of social or cultural determination - rather such systems and norms emerge out of a biologically cultural engagement with an environment. If this is so, and if this is something that we have in part learnt from robotics, what is it that we might learn from avatars? One of the unique features of human sociality and cognition is its virtual character. Its not just that we learn to recognize that symbols stand for things in the world, but that we can also refer to those things when they are not there and bring them to mind. The character of our visual engagement with the world means that once we have an object in front of us, we can envisage doing a number of different things with it, actively visualize what might be the outcome of our actions, and decide not to pursue some or all of them. It is the symbolic nature of our engagement with the world that means that we do not just receive communications or other forms of stimuli, but we extract the intended meaning or significance through interpretation. Certainly, often when we do this we employ patterned behavioural responses, autonomic and affective responses to guide us and orient us, but we also have the capacity to use culture to amplify our capacities. For example, the oracle at Delphi exerted considerable influence throughout the Greek world, and no major decision was taken without consulting her. Yet after falling into a trance she is said to have uttered words incomprehensible to mere mortals, and even after the priests of the sanctuary had interpreted them they were always open to further interpretation, often containing dual and opposing meanings. Much effort was expended on the vagaries of the Gods, demonstrating, if nothing else, the human capacity for finding meaning in the world, as well as the all too human desire for attachment to the world through rendering it sensible to meaning. We make ourselves in social environments and within worlds of objects, and yet we dream of things we can only dimly discern, worry about things as abstract as fate, expend energy on the intentions of beings that do not exist and try to discern the meanings of fleeting utterances. The relationship of belief, intention and symbol to the world are also subject to theorization and problematization by individuals and communities. Cultural and historical variation in such things as theories of transcendence, divinity, and representation can and do have a profound effect on modes of perception, action and critical reflection: for example, Modernisms revolutionary assertion that imaginative representation was superior to merely imitative or mimetic art. It is said that when Picasso painted his portrait of Gertrude Stein, and Cambridge Anthropology • 57</page><page sequence="11">Henrietta L Moore he finally managed, after eighty or so failed sittings, to render her features through the planed features of an African ceremonial mask, he was asked whether it really looked like her, and he responded that in time, it would. He was right, in the sense that modern art did indeed make people see things differently, and not all forms of representation are merely mimetic or formal. The anthropological record is replete with examples. Any view of human sociality has to take account of these capacities, not just their peculiar propensity for forward and backward projection in space and time (memory, regret, aspiration, hope) - thus extending any notion of environment' or cultural ecology' well beyond the presentism of many theoretical formulations of affect or assemblages of actants - but also crucially their ability to imaginatively ascribe attributes and qualities, and subsequently to form attachments, to things of the imagination. These may be Gods or myths, or more prosaic things such as communities, nations and other social imaginaries. This means that in the realm of human agency, there remains a question about what exactly constitutes an object, and indeed about the relation that objects have to acting, perceiving, affective, willed subjects. Avatars are instructive here because they are objects that we endow with meaning and value. Avatars come in many shapes and forms, and users have the ability to manipulate the appearance, attributes and characteristics of their avatars. In much of the literature on avatars the dominant discussion is about identity and identities. A lingering question remains about how avatars relate to the selves of their creators.5 Some create their avatar in their own image, others engage in whimsical, bizarre and even outlandish constructions. For some individuals, the avatar is an idealized projection of self, while for others it is a way of experimenting with new identities. Some online users celebrate the fact that avatars allow their creators freedom from the constraints of biological, social and cultural determinants, such as disability, ethnicity, race and gender, while many analysts tend to demur, pointing out that avatar identities often reproduce and reinforce conventional and highly problematic ideas about social and cultural distinctions, such as race and gender (e.g., Nakamura 2002). Regulators in their turn worry about impostors, scammers and those intent on doing harm by misleading others. Sometimes, this results in a kind of moral panic, where commentators see paedophiles behind every virtual bush. Virtual worlds are often portrayed in the media as dangerous, addictive and escapist, a form of social pathology. What do people do in virtual worlds? The short answer is that they drive cars, go shopping, take the dog for a walk, fall in love, have sex, fly, raise sheep, vanquish opponents, swim, go to gay bars, earn money - real money - dance, discuss and take university courses. Cybersociality is not insignificant; people create worlds and in the process create themselves. In February 201 1, Farmville had 62 million active users, and 10 per cent of all facebook users play the game.6 World of Warcraft has 11.4 million subscribers, and Second Life 1.5 million. Some individuals already spend twenty- five hours a week in these virtual environments, roughly equivalent to a day per week. In the future, if you live to be seventy years old, you might have spent nearly ten years of your life in a virtual environment. Virtual reality is now part of life, and interestingly new research on university students shows that anonymity is not something they seek through online engagement: their current perception is that there is continuity between online and offline worlds, and that you will be held to account for what you do online 58 • Cambridge Anthropology</page><page sequence="12">The Imaginary Present and the Socialities of the Inorganic just as much as you will be in the offline world.7 Tom Boellestorff, who conducted ethnographic research in Second Life, regularly appears as himself in discussion fora in that world, and he is not alone, as many universities and companies move their activities online (Boellstorff 2008). Avatars are now much more likely in these contexts to be representations - even if augmented - of actual named individuals who are living a segment of their lives online. This blurring of the informatic and the biological, the virtual and the actual creates new contexts for human sociality, new kinds of social actors, new narratives for relations between self and world, and new languages in which to discuss such matters. However, reframing the question of the relation between self and avatar requires further reflection. Recent research on violence in virtual worlds demonstrates that those whose avatars are stalked, killed, raped, assaulted and/or tortured experience great distress. Being affected by online harm is most certainly a consequence of emotional engagement with the online world and the avatar (Wolfendale 2007). What is clear is that individuals form attachments to their avatars. In one particularly complex set of relations, a male individual created both a male and a female avatar who then fell in love with each other inside the virtual world. Media commentators poke fun at such situations, and indeed at those who get married in Second Life and divorced in Texas as a result of virtual infidelity. However, the partners involved do not always take these betrayals as virtual, or rather if they do, it is because betrayal always has a virtual character even in the actual world. Upright soccer mums who work as pole dancers in Second Life and Harvard- trained economists who pretend to be elves all raise questions about whether the online avatar is an aspect of self, a form of role playing, or an object like a doll or a puppet to be manipulated at the controllers whim. Individuals have many motivations for becoming involved in virtual worlds, and those motivations are becoming more complex and differentiated as more and more aspects of life move online or rather can be performed both online and offline. Many people now make a living in a virtual environment, and, of course, the vast majority of those do not actually inhabit a so-called virtual world. Humans have historically always used objects and technology to extend their reach and to augment their cognitive and affective capacities. But what avatars reveal is that humans in their interactions with objects animate them, project through their interactions with them aspects and attributes of anthropos, seek out aspects of intentionality. Researchers working on humanoid robots report that provided the robots can perform tasks that mimic humans, individuals treat them as if they were sentient beings like themselves, even apologizing for standing too close to them (Shaw- Garlock 2009: 254). What is curious about avatars however is that they are involved in social interactions with other avatars in a symbolically rich world, and, as many participants report, actual world sociality does not completely explain virtual world sociality. This is because the sociality of the virtual world develops in its own terms, within its own cultural ecology, with avatars interacting with other avatars, and the results are unpredictable; they emerge from interaction in context. Many participants report instances of what has become known as the Proteus affect, where the actions or characteristics of the avatar produce changes in the creator/controller (Yee and Bailenson 2007). These may involve changes in self-esteem or in attitudes, but often Cambridge Anthropology • 59</page><page sequence="13">Henrietta L. Moore involve a perception that the avatar is an independent agent or that rather than being the representation of a human self, the avatar is the locus of agency and the human the embodied referent of the avatar. Just as in the past, the puppets were said to control the puppeteers, and inanimate figures (Pinocchio, for example) were thought to come alive and revenge themselves on their makers. Sherry Turkle has discussed the ways humans use objects - many of them technologies - to develop and enhance a sense of self, to evoke aifect, to find ways of engaging with the world, and to enhance cognitive functions (Turkle 2007). Such objects become closely intertwined with the self. Avatars exist on the boundary between the self and the object world, they implicate the forms of engagement and attachment that characterize human sociality, they draw on the pleasure of imaginative power for rethinking the world and our relations with others. The very fact that they are a virtual creation of our embodied engagement with objects and with the world - as we type them into existence on the computer - makes them imaginatively powerful for us. Virtual engagement is still a sensory experience (sights, sounds, touch), and our avatars as products of our imaginations are developmental objects: they develop over time as they acquire new appearances, powers, objects and experiences. They become the in-world embodiment of our in-world experience, and as such they generate aifect and attachment. Conclusion Following Latour, we can agree that avatars are neither object nor subject, but if indeed they are things that possess 'body and soul indissolubly', it is because we animate them with these properties. Much of human sociality is and always has been virtual. Human life may be no longer confined to the organic, as people begin to live their lives - or part of them - in virtual worlds. However, peoples ability to use digital representations of themselves depends on the much older human capacity for virtuality, for endowing things of the imagination and the mind with meaning and significance. What makes avatars distinctive arguably is that they create their own forms of sociality within online worlds in ways that are not completely under the control of their creators. However, as I have argued in this paper, while human sociality is underpinned by aifect, it is nonetheless distinctive, and it is humans, not avatars, who hold views about social relations, values, and ideas, things that have to be brought into being through acts of the imagination. The avatar is a kind of extended metaphor, an allegory of the relation between images of the human body and actual human bodies, between the self and its relation to the world. What avatars demonstrate are many things of which we are already well aware: there is no fixed subject/object divide; humans form attachments to objects; objects, non-humans, and the inhuman are actants in the world. However, agency is not the same thing as sociality. I happily reserve judgement on slime mould, but certainly ants and the non-human primates - among many other organic things - have forms of agency and sociality. However, they do not have human sociality. The biologically evolved capacity for linking affect to higher order cognitive states ensures that in humans affect is not prior to and external to social meaning. Human representation and symbol-making are productive of affect, which is then imbued with value and meaning, as avatars themselves so amply demonstrate. The ceaseless vitality 60 • Cambridge Anthropology</page><page sequence="14">The Imaginary Present and the Socialities of the Inorganic of cellular reproduction, the vitalism of the living world, may be seductive metaphors for our relations with the many non-human others with whom we share our world as we face the challenges of environmental and financial policies gone horribly awry. But we should not imagine that models and metaphors of biological processes profitably capture the character of human sociality, whose defining characteristic is that it depends on things that are not of this world.
