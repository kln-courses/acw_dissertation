<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FAERIE KING'S KUNSTKAMMER: IMPERIAL DISCOURSE AND THE WONDROUS IN SIR ORFEO BY ANNE MARIE DARCY The meaning and composition of the figures that litter the forecourt of the Faerie King's palace in the Auchinleck Manuscript version of Sir Orfeo have been the topic of considerable debate. This article suggests that the full effect of this Kunstkammer can only be understood in the light of the persistent, mistrustful distaste for sculpture in the round, which is rooted in patristic writings and popular belief, but also informed by contemporary ideological clashes between the Papacy, the Holy Roman Empire and the English state. The numinous power of this outdoor sculptural gallery - which seems measureless to man and includes Orfeo's wife - is palpable, but whereas Orfeo feels wonder, the modern reader's response tends to be refracted through the lens of organic body horror, or a seemingly obscure sense of Das Unheimliche. It is, however, in combination with a number of other telling features of the Faerie King's framing of himself, an important part of a series of demonic simulacra referring simultaneously to both the pretensions of the devil and the pretensions of more earthly powers - imperial and papal. All the artifice of the Faerie King's seat creates a deep disquietude, arising from the ultimate nature of its causation. It is not created out of love as is God's creation made manifest in the poet's vision of Winchester, but as an assertion of power by which the beautiful is sundered from the good in the spectacula, or works and pomps, of this tyrannical, demonic usurper. The Faerie King's crown of one stone, with its conscious debt to the orphan stone motif, even the tabernacular niche in which he sits, recall the imperial and the papal in contexts which stress the overreaching corruptibility of power in the recent past of the Auchinleck narrator. Perhaps the most intractable problem that the reader of Sir Orfeo encounters is the precise nature of what confronts the protagonist on entering the Faerie King's palace: Pan he gan bihold about al &amp; sei3e liggeand wip-in ?e wal Of folk bat were kider y-brou3t, &amp; pou3t dede, &amp; nare nou3t.

Through anaphora, variation, and a potentially endless catenulate structure, the narrator imposes a rhetorical plan on an experience so horrible that words indeed might fail.3 Indeed, it would seem that in expending such skill on crafting this description, the Auchinleck narrator wishes to highlight the importance of the passage to our understanding of the poem. However, are Lerer and others correct in assuming that this is a horrible experience for Orfeo? Any sense of horror that the audience might experience is directly related to their respective assumptions as to what exactly he sees within the walls. Thus it is important to note that the narrator does not register horror on the part of Orfeo, even after he sees 'his owhen wiif,/Dame Heurodis, his lef liif' (11. 405-6), but rather a sense of strangely detached wonder (11. 409-10): &amp; when he hadde bihold ?is meruails alle, He went in-to le kinges halle.4 We become all the more keenly aware of this abstraction of empathy when we reflect on the emotional toll exacted by his earlier recognition scene with Heurodis, now one of the sixty ladies on horseback hunting with the Faerie Host: 'Allas!' qual he,'Now me is wo!' Whi nil del now me slo? Allas, wroche! - Pat y no mi3t Dye now after Pis si3t! 1 Sir Orfeo, ed. A.J. Bliss, 2nd edn (Oxford, 1966), 11. 387-402.

Although the text remains tantalisingly opaque as to whether this Heurodis has been compositionally altered from flesh and blood, it would appear that she forms part of a potentially vast Kunstkammer of figural representations that reveal the interstice, no thicker than a fissure in a rock in contemporary sensibilities, between the corporeal and the marmoreal. The figures are drawn in the most literal sense from nature, and bear silent witness - in a manner that recalls at least on the aesthetic level Rilke's Archaischer Torso Apollos, or Keats's Elgin Marbles - to the revenant potentiality trapped in 'these wonders'. I propose that the Auchinleck narrator consciously presents these figures in terms of statues in the round, in just as deliberate a manner as he deploys precise architectural terminology in the description of the castle. In addition to the references to 'butras' and 'vousour' (11. 361-3), Lerer draws particular attention to the 'diuers aumal' (1. 364), which does not seem to refer to 'true enamel work'; rather, 'an artificial enamel made by painting on glass or foil' The enamelled effect produced, originally developed in Byzantium and called pictura translucida, 'alerts the reader to the status of fairyland as a world of artifice'7 Moreover, this sense of the castle as an artificer's masterpiece, a painted simulacrum of paradise designed to deceive by ornament, is not only borne out by the note of artificiality introduced into the seemingly celestial castle by the emphasis on the role of craft in producing the wondrous effects of light and colour,8 but also by the presence of what appears to be statuary. It might be argued that if these figures are statues - in contradistinction to statuesque bodies - they evoke a sense of the uncanny because of the unseemly and distressing pathos gestures ascribed to some, but certainly not all, of them, and that is certainly the principal effect they have had on modern critics of 5 Sir Orfeo, 29,1. 323: '3ern he biheld hir, &amp; sche him eke' See P. J. Lucas,'An Interpretation of Sir Orfeo' Leeds Studies in English, 6 (1972), 1-9: 4: 'One of the reasons why these lines stand out in the poem as being so moving is probably that the word 3ern, when construed with &amp; sche him eke, contains the only description (as opposed to expression) of emotion on Heurodis's part in the poem? 6 Sir Orfeo, 30, 11. 331-4. 7 Lerer,'Artifice and Artistry', 100. 8 The locus for this image is the heavenly Jerusalem which will be lit by 'the glory of God, and the light thereof was like to a precious stone', thus will have 'no need of the sun, nor of the moon, to shine in it' (Revelation 21: 11, 23).

But for a contemporary audience they would have had a theologico- political significance that may not be immediately apparent to us unless we understand how statues in the round were viewed throughout the medieval period. If these figures are statues in the round, whether the subject matter is indecorous or not, they could be read as indicative of the suspect nature of the demiurgic potentate who has prised them from their temporal settings only to exhibit them, albeit significantly transmuted, as testament to his seemingly all-encompassing power. Throughout the middle ages idolatry was particularly identified with the worship of statues in the round, and the creation and display of such images was associated with the works and pomps of the arch dissimulator himself.9 However, this doctrinal commination did not preclude the fact that the capture and display of free-standing statues also had a long-established history as an important propagandistic tool in the process of translatio imperii.10 While Michael Camille is correct in stating that in 'all cultures images are set up by rulers as signs of control'" appropriation of the classical inheritance of statues in the round has been associated with a declaration of imperial magnificence since the sack of Athens by Xerxes in 480 BC. Thus, while statues in the round are frequently considered idolatrous and demonic in a Christian theological context from late antiquity to the autumn of the middle ages and beyond, they were also deployed in a political context as wondrous exhibits indicative of imperial power by such holy and eminently Roman rulers as Constantine, Charlemagne, Frederick II, and indeed, Boniface VIII. I propose that the Faerie King in Sir Orfeo is consciously presented as an imperial figure, but one untrammelled by the theological concerns and sacerdotal duties of these rulers of Christian polities. Thus his interest in translating and transmuting the Taken into statues can be read as a powerful demonstration of his demonic status as an artificer, a status which is reflected in his imperial assertion of power over humankind in general and Orfeo and his kingdom in particular. The Auchinleck 9 The condemnation of statues in the round as idols is particularly associated with classical statuary, as evinced by the existence of free-standing cult statues of the Virgin in Majesty (many of the earliest examples being designed to hold relics such as that made by Adelelmus for the cathedral of Clermont-Ferrand (after 946) or the eleventh-century examples from Essen, Hildesheim and Paderborn); cf. I. H. Forsyth, The Throne of Wisdom: Wood Sculptures of the Madonna in Romanesque France (Princeton, 1972), esp. 31-60. There is also the reliquary of St Foy at Conques, however, the initial response of the eleventh- century scholasticus Bernard of Angers was that it resembled an idol, specifically a classical statue; cf. J. and M. -C. Hubert,'Piete chretienne ou paganisme?

Fletcher describes it,12 is not only a powerful way of warning the reader that the union of ethics and aesthetics embodied in the concept of Kalokagathia is notably absent in this society, where all that glisters is not gold (or even true enamel), and certainly not good though superficially beautiful, but also that the ruler's imperium is unabashedly Luciferian. From the fifth century to the later medieval period we witness an aversion toward sculpting figures in the round, which stems ultimately from an atavistic fear of pagan antique statuary and 'the Jewish reluctance to tolerate sculpted (including embossed) images but willingness to accept flat or engraved ones'.13 For the patristic period the repugnance toward statues inherited from Platonic philosophy was reinforced by selective Jewish interpretations of what constituted a graven image. According to the version of the Decalogue that appears in Exodus 20: 4, sculpted images are specifically regarded as idolatrous.14 Allied to this inherited theologico-philosophical aniconism was the resonant belief that statues have the potentiality to become animated, that is, ensouled, which in turn became inextricably linked with demonology in the early Christian period. Thus for the middle ages, as Ernst Kris and Otto Kurz remind us, 'The classical figure in the round, "which already had an aura of darkness and magic in late antiquity", must have seemed the very embodiment of the devil's handiwork of deception.'15 Patristic writers were aware of the nexus of concepts encapsulated in the word daimon,16 including the idea that statues could be animated by daimones, that is, good or bad spirits who mediate between the 12 Cf. A. J. Fletcher, 'Sir Orfeo and the Flight from the Enchanters', Studies in the Age of Chaucer 22 (2000), 141-78: 142, n. 4, who uses the term to 'emphasize the sense of their being displayed like so many statues in an exhibition'. 13 D. Freedberg, The Power of Images: Studies in the History and Theory of Response (Chicago and London, 1989), 389. 14 The divine institution of the brazen serpent proved problematic from an aniconist perspective and it was later destroyed as part of the iconoclastic policy ascribed to Hezekiah (Vg Ezechias) because of its idolatrous potential (4 Kings 18: 4). However, in keeping with the divine institution of the cherubim on the Ark (Exodus 25: 18), figurative images also featured in the Solomonic Temple; cf. 2 Chronicles 3: 7, 10-13; 4: 3-4. The specific reference to sculpted forms in Deuteronomy 4: 15-18 may be an interpolation dating from the Josianic Reform. Cf. also Margaret Aston, England' Iconoclasts I: Laws Against Images (Oxford, 1988), 109, who points out that in the case of Lollard iconomachy, 'The imagery seen as proscribed by the law was primarily three-dimensional.' 15 E.

The hands and feet of pagan statues were broken; their faces and genitals were mutilated'26 and while the preservation of statues on aesthetic grounds, albeit some suitably drained of their daemonic power due to the pre- sence of the sign of the cross on their foreheads,27 was later enshrined in the Theodosian Code, Gdtterddmmerung for statues in the round had already begun. As Michael Greenhalgh points out, free-standing anthropomorphic sculpture 'appears to have died a slow death through an increasing lack of interest in its nature or possible applications (an attitude common even before 400 AD)'. 22 F. Norwood,'Attitude of the Ante-Nicene Fathers Toward Greek Artistic Achievement' Journal of the History of Ideas 8 (1947), 431-48: 442. 23 Oratio ad Graecos, 33: 'What lesson in nobility did you learn from Glaucippe who bore a monstrous child, as we know from the statue of her which was cast by Niceratus son of Euctemon, an Athenian by birth? For if she became pregnant with an elephant what reason was there for Glaucippe to enjoy public honour?... Euthycrates cast in bronze Panteuchis when she was pregnant by rape. Dinomenes contrived that Besantis, queen of the Paeonians, should be remembered through his art because she bore a black child' (Whittaker, 62-3). See also G. F Hawthorne, 'Tatian and his Discourse to the Greeks', Harvard Theological Review 57 (1964), 161-88; D. Karadimas, Tatian' Oratio Ad Graecos: Rhetoric and Philosophy/Theology (Stockholm, 2004). Apart from these attributed statues, we may also note the tradition of depicting women in the act of childbirth in Hellenic funerary sculpture; cf. N.

That this type of mirabilia narrative, also preserved in the Gesta Romanorum, was known in twelfth-century England is evinced by William of Malmesbury's description of the subterranean treasurehouse of Octavian with its 'wonderful great golden horses with riders too all of gold;31 which not only recall the medieval legends surrounding the gilt bronze statue of Marcus Aurelius and the bronze of Theoderic translated to Aachen by Charlemagne,32 but also 28 The Survival of Roman Antiquities in the Middle Ages (London, 1989), 202. Indeed,'Roman prefects towards the end of the fifth century ordered damaged works (once dissociated from pagan cults) to be restored' but 'manufacture was in decline: the latest recorded in Rome is that of Phocas in 608' (ibid.). However, there is considerable argument as to whether this statue is actually of seventh-century manufacture. 29 Apart from various pilgrims' descriptions of Rome we may note the reaction to the statues in the Hippodrome ascribed to the retinue of the Norwegian king Sigur6r J6rsalafari in the Konnungasogur; cf.

Furthermore, the figures within the walls of the castle, unlike their purgatorial analogues in Sir Owain for instance,33 are endowed with an air of numinosity which stems from their translation. Their abduction and subsequent exhibition as statues make a statement about the appropriation of power through the appropriation of statuary which has many historical precedents. We are not only reminded of the Roman capture of Hellenic statues from at least the sack of Syracuse by Marcellus in 211 B.C. onwards,34 but also of Xerxes' capture of the statues of Athens (especially those in bronze of Harmodius and Aristogiton by Antenor), and their subsequent exhibition at Susa which constituted the 'visible expression of Persian triumph'.3 We may also note Alexander's reappro- priation of these statues,36 and the exhibition of pharaonic Egyptian statues at Alexandria under the Ptolomies.37 In each of these cases, as Sarah Bassett points out,'the plunder and subsequent display of statuary in a new setting was a way to express a hierarchical relationship between one population and another'.38 Similarly, in Sir Orfeo the captured human figures are preserved and displayed as spolia: a mute yet resonant testimony to the imperium of the Otherworld. Although some of these statues would seem to stand as cautionary exercises in the grotesque which serve to illustrate what fools these mortals be - as opposed to a governing principle of Kalokagathia at work in the Faerie realm - their presence within the walls is an assertion of power. As spolia these figures recall in particular the reason why statues, almost inevitably the fodder for limekilns and bronze foundries elsewhere, continued to be preserved in late antique Rome and especially in Constantinople.39 Emperors.

It would seem that Henry, or rather 'a certain grammarian' speaking on behalf of the bishop, suggested that it was only his Christian duty to despatch them to England, thus depriving 'the Romans of their gods to prevent them restoring the ancient rites of worship, as they seemed all to ready to do, since their inborn, inveterate and ineradicable creation of the emperor and his advisors, this collection, composed largely of antiquities of pre-fourth-century manufacture, was created by transporting the sculptured riches of the cities and sanctuaries of the Roman Empire to the newly founded capital' 40 Contra orationem Symmachi, 1, 502-5 (Prudentius, trans.

However, even if statues were no longer regarded as demonically possessed, now exorcised by the imprint of the sphragis or a sprinkling of holy water, they were still 'feared and destroyed because they were considered inimical to the Christian religion, and also because the old myth of Prometheus taught that a man was a statue into which life had been breathed'.45 Greenhalgh goes on to point out that this nurtured the idea that 'their limbs might move, and they could probably think - hence the plentiful legends with which they were surrounded during the Middle Ages'.46 Throughout the medieval period such distinctions as whether a statue moves on its own, or is caused to move mechanically or animated by supernatural agency; whether it speaks spontaneously, or is caused to speak by supernatural agency; whether it was manufactured as the representation of a god or a mortal, or came into being through some process of petrifaction, became markedly blurred. Indeed, the exact composition of the statues in Sir Orfeo is similarly ambiguous. Even if we accept that they are compositionally altered from flesh and blood, whether they have come into being through some process of petrifaction or metallization of the organic body, now transmuted into an inanimate sarcophagus for the living soul, or whether the souls of the Taken inhabit stone or bronze simulacra, is as much of a wonder as the process of their translation to the Faerie realm.47 However, the persistent belief in the ensoulment of statues accounts for the reason why very often it is the limbs and the head of classical statues which are destroyed,48 thus disabling - as opposed to extin- guishing - the souls locked into stone or bronze simulacra. 44 John of Salisbury, Historia Pontificalis, 40 (Memoirs of the Papal Court, ed. and trans.

According to the thirteenth-century Dominican chronicler Martin of Troppau (following Magister Gregorius), Gregory the Great is cred- ited with the destruction of the salvatio Romae, that is, the magically animated statues of the Capitol, having 'caused all the heads and limbs of the statues of the demons to be</page><page sequence="12">THE FAERIE KING'S KUNSTKAMMER 21 Perhaps the habit of preserving antique torsos accounts for the fact that among the Faerie King's statues 'sum non armes nade'. Certainly the popular belief that even mutilated torsos retained the spark of life within them would go a long way to explain how a figure 'wi]-outen hade' could be described as '?ou3t dede, &amp; nare nou3t'49 Moreover, there is a curious echo of the preservation of antique torsos in the Faerie King's chilling assertion of authority over Heurodis: 'Loke, dame, to-morwe patow be Ri3t here vnder Pis ympe-tre, &amp; pan Pou schalt wil ous go, &amp; liue wi4 ous euer-mo; &amp; 3if lou makest ous y-let, Whar Pou be, Pou worst y-fet, &amp; to-tore Pine limes al, pat noping help pe no schal; &amp; pei Pou best so to-torn, 3ete Pou worst wip ous y-born' (11. 165-74) The fact that Heurodis as a mutilated torso with head is still thought worth capturing (and perhaps displaying in the company of those who 'non armes nade') is an ample demonstration of the hierarchical relationship between the Faerie realm and Orfeo's kingdom. Thus, while this threat of dismemberment 'may seem to indicate a desperate need to have Heurodis in the Otherworld',50 reminiscent of the behaviour of such chthonic deities as Hades or Pluto, or indeed, the daemonium meridianum of Psalm 90 as Friedman suggests,51 'it is actually designed to gain Orfeo's attention. In fact, Heurodis holds little interest for the fairies other than for her addition to their collection of "taken" mortals'52 So, why does the Faerie King capture, immobilise and exhibit Heurodis as a living statue? Because he can. In the manner of Xerxes, Alexander, Marcellus, Ptolemy Soter or Constantine, his seizures are displayed as testament to the superior power of the Faerie realm and to his own imperium. This superiority is emphasised by the fact that although Orfeo faces the threat of her abduction with 'wele ten hundred kni3tes wi? him' (1. 183), resistance proves futile in the face of the Faerie King's very Roman sense of raptus whereby enlevement broken, so that from the crushed roots of heresy, the palm of Christian truth might more fully manifest itself' (ibid., 47). The most popular of the medieval guides to Rome gives the best known account of the salvatio Romae; cf. Mirabilia Urbis Romae, 46-7. 49 Sir Orfeo, 34, 1. 390. 50 A. B.

Indeed, the apparently subaltern status of Orfeo may be inferred from one telling detail in Heurodis' first impressions of the Faerie King: Pe king hadde a croun on hed; It nas of siluer, no of gold red, Ac it was of a precious ston - As bri3t as Pe sonne it schon. (11. 149-52) Orfeo's crown is by contrast unremarkable, merely the most emblematic insignia of kingship that he must relinquish in the wilderness.54 The fact that the Faerie King's crown consists of a single refulgent jewel not only heightens the numinous aura surrounding him, but also recalls the traditional association of orphan stones with imperial magnificence. We have only to think of the medie- val accounts of al-Yati'ma, the unique or orphan pearl that 'became the Abbasid royal insignia', though later came into the possession of the Fatimids, the brilli- ance of which 'was said to be whiter than the brightness of the planet Venus'55 or the numerous Western legends surrounding the Orphanus, also known as the Pupillus. In De mineralibus, Albertus Magnus identifies the Orphanus with what appears to be a luminous fire opal of unique beauty set in the Reichskrone of the Holy Roman Emperor.56 In the first complete Middle High German version of 53 Here, it is important to note that Roman law did not view raptus as a crime perpetrated against the woman herself, rather against her husband or guardian; cf. J. Evans-Grubbs, 'Abduction Marriage in Antiquity: A Law of Constantine (CTh IX.24.I) and Its Social Context', Journal of Roman Studies 79 (1989), 59-83. Cf. also J. B. Post, 'Ravishment of Women and the Statutes of Westminster', in Legal Records and the Historian, ed. J. Baker (London, 1978), 150-64. However, in the specific instance of Sir Orfeo, as opposed to Sir Degard for instance, I do not see any evidence of the blurring of the distinction between raptus and rape that sometimes occurs in medieval legal texts in particular. See C. Saunders, Rape and Ravishment in the Literature of Medieval England (Cambridge, 2001), 233 and N. Cartlidge, 'Sir Orfeo in the Otherworld: Courting Chaos?'

For Otto von Botenlauben, the Waise is a carbuncle, rather than the lost cabachon opal that Albertus Magnus seems to describe. Although the exact gemological properties of the carbuncle as under- stood by classical authorities is the topic of some debate, the term seems to have referred to any red crystalline stone cut en cabochon.61 For Chaucer the carbuncle is synonomous with the ruby and the imperium of Fame, who sits enthroned 'in a see imperiall': That mad was of a rubee all, Which that a carbuncle ys ycalled.62 (Stuttgart, 1976); G.

The claustral magnificence suggested by the 'tabernacle blisseful &amp; bri3t' (1. 412) and the dazzling regalia of the ruler and his consort belie the darkness at the centre of this phosphorescent pomp of state. The use of the word 'tabernacle' in this context is interesting, as it is deployed with a technical precision that recalls the earlier use of 'butras' and 'vousour'.66 In architectural terms a tabernacle is a canopied niche, housing a figure or group of figures raised up on a bracket or corbel acting as a platform. Indeed, as Jack Bennett points out, the presentation of the royal couple 'is that favoured by thirteenth-century sculptors and artists, who regularly placed royalty in such crocketed tabernacles' 67 Thus a distinction is drawn between these hieratic, almost anaglyptic figures, enshrined in a baldachined niche which serves to heighten their lithic stateliness, and the all too human plasticity of the free-standing figures, captured almost au vif. Camille describes 'the dialectic in medieval art between the abstract schematic forms of the good - the frontal hieratic figures of saints - as opposed to the vigorous, lively gestures of their tormentors'68 In this context he discusses the moral import ascribed to the handling of space in the thirteenth- century reliefs of the Virtues from Amiens cathedral, which are 'hieratic, frontally viewed, seated figures with all the connotational authority of the enthroned divinity' while those of the Vices are 'exemplified in lively actions, their profile and three-quarter forms entering into and projecting from the spaces'. Moreover, just as each of the human figures in Sir Orfeo is caught Shakespeare, King Henry IV, Part 1, I. ii. 207-10; Richard III, v. iii. 250-1; Richard II, I. iii. 266-7 and II. i. 46. 63 The carbuncle was lost from the papal tiara on the day of Clement V's coronation at Lyons, 14 November 1305, an event invested with portentious doom by German and Italian chroniclers in particular; cf. Etienne Baluze, Vitae Paparum Avenionensium, ed. G. Mollat, 4 vols (Paris, 1916-22), I, 91. 64 Les textes de la Chanson de Roland I: La version d'Oxford, ed. R.

However, just as the 'wide wones / Al of precious stones' (11. 365-6) are counterfeit of the dilecta tabernacula in Zion - with its many, spacious mansions, terribilis est locus iste (Genesis 28: 17) but not in a good, or truly beautiful way - this ornamental tabernacle work, reminiscent of that enhanced by pictura translucida on the Westminster retable,71 is an artificial imitation. It is a mere trompe l'oeil of the tabernacle sanctified by the most High.72 That the sacralized posture of the Faerie King in his simulated Castle of Paradise is fashioned after the manner of the enthroned Judge of the World is made evident by the inexorable conclusion of his doomsday words to Orfeo: 'What man artow, Pat art hider y-comen now? Ich, no non Pat is wil me, No sent neuer after pe. Se~pen Pat ich here regni gan Y no fond neuer so fole-hardi man Pat hider to ous durst wende, Bot pat ic him wald of-sende' (11. 421-8) Like the minstrel king David, Orfeo seeks to 'give praise upon the harp' (Psalm 42: 4), but he is sternly rebuked because he has not received what is pre- sented as the eschatological summons of a pantokrator, or rather, an apparently 69 Ibid., 9-10. 70 Ataraxia was an important component in fashioning the self as a royal effigy, as in the case of Philip the Fair cited by Camille, Gothic Idol, 291, which has precedences in Byzantine court ceremonial. 71 As P. M. Macek,'The Discoveries of the Westminster Retable' Archaeologia 109 (1991), 101-11: 101, puts it: 'the "gold" is but gilded wood, the "gems" and "cameos" are made of glass and paste, the enamels are simply paint under glass'.

The Faerie King's words and demeanour not only recall Ahasuerus and his ordinance in Esther 4: 11 that any who approach him without being summoned will be punished by death,73 but also the satanic hyper- bolae ascribed to the Prince of Tyre in Ezekiel 28: 2: 'I am God, and I sit in the chair of God'. Like the King of Babylon in Isaiah 14: 14, interpreted as a type of Lucifer as Satan in patristic exegesis,74 the Faerie King aspires to being 'like the most High', which was understood by exegetes to mean likeness, as opposed to equality. The Faerie King may look good in divine similitude, but he is far from good; rather, like Satan who 'transformeth himself into an angel of light' (2 Corinthians 11: 14), he strives to have imperium over others by the potestas of his own nature. We witness the clearest divergence between the beautiful and the good in the Faerie King's response to Orfeo's request to recuperate his wife. The actions of the ruler prove that goodness of spirit is not reflected in beauty of body, which is only an integument deep, rather like the applied decoration that typifies the architectonics. Like the sponsa of the Song of Songs, interpreted by such exegetes as Bernard of Clairvaux, or indeed, Gilbert Foliot, bishop of London, as mirroring the suffering Christ,75 Orfeo is misliked and ridiculed for his blackened complexion: A sori couple of 3ou it were, For 1ou art lene, rowe &amp; blac, &amp; sche is louesum, wipouten lac: A loplich thing it were, forgi, To sen hir in Pi compayni. (11. 458-62) Similarly, the human suffering embodied in some of the statues is presented as a mere curiosity, only validated by its aesthetic form and the numinous function ascribed to that form. From a medieval Christian perspective, the principal demonic preoccupation is the emulation of the divine. This belief would seem to inform the construction of the castle itself. It is an inflated, albeit eminently haptic, architectural maquette, puffed with pride and featuring lifesize demiurgic statuary in the round, pointing ultimately to the Faerie King's 73 'All the king's servants, and all the provinces that are under his dominion, know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, cometh into the king's inner court, who is not called for, is immediately to be put to death without any delay' Cf. Esther 15: 9-14. 74 The earliest occurrence of this identification in a precosmic context would seem to be found in Origen, De Principiis, 1, 5, 5 (GCS 22, 75-8), though Justin Martyr and Tertullian had previously made this connection; cf. H. A. Kelly, 'The Devil in the Desert' Catholic Biblical Quarterly (1964) 190-220, 203-4; J. B. Russell, Satan: The Early Christian Tradition (Ithaca, NY, 1981), 130; N.

If the Faerie King is a type of Lucifer as imperator mundi, who has bound the soul of Heurodis to a body transmuted for short time into a potentially endless monument, then the fact that Orfeo uses dissimulation, claiming that he is 'bot a pouver menstrel' (1. 430) in order to win her back, is in accordance with the topos of cheating the devil.78 Orfeo has already been established as a type of David due to the therapeutic effect of his harping in the wilderness (the recovery of his harp marking a progression from the initial, politically charged evocation of Nebuchadnezzar in his madness),79 and like David, Orfeo is able to enter the ruler's court only because of his musical skill. But whilst David's harping was capable of casting forth a demonic spirit from the reigning king,80 in the case of Orfeo, his music is possessed of a merely momentary capacity to neutralize demonic power. However, as is customary in cheating the devil, Orfeo trusts that the Faerie king will keep his promise, however rash, 76 Cf. Ephesians 6: 12: 'For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places' Cf. also John 12: 31. It is Ireneaus who first uses the title 'ruler of the world' in the singular (Prologue to Adversus haereses, PG 7, 435-6), which he applies specifically to the gnostic demiurge, who is both the creator and ruler and identified in this context with 'Diabolus et daemonia' However, it was adopted by Septimus Severus, in identification with Sarapis and in imitation of Alexander the Great, and ascribed to Roman emperors from Caracalla onwards; cf. E Cumont,'Mithra ou Sarapis KOEMOKPAT2P ', Comptes rendus des slances de lAcadimie des inscriptions et belles-lettres, 4 ser. 47 (1919), 314-28, esp. 318-28; A. M.

Sir Orfeo, 1. 146,'As white as milke were her wedes'), and distinguished by 'his power and unapproachability' (M. Lazar, 'Theophilus: Servant of Two Masters.

As Cartlidge points out: 'the emphasis on the uniform whiteness and brightness of the fairies and their livery is so studied as to provoke at least the suspicion of some sort of camouflaging of horrors - a literal whitening of something sinisterly sepulchral' ('Sir Orfeo in the Otherworld', 202). 79 Daniel 6: 28-30.

For Augustine, as for Tertullian, the devil is the primigenial fabricator of simulacra. Commenting on Porphyry's description of theurgy he states: What of it that those who work these sordid purfications by irreligious rites behold with supposedly purified spirits certain visions of angels or of gods... if indeed they really see anything of the kind? It is as the apostle says: 'For Satan transforms himself to look like an angel of light? For those phantoms come from him who, hoping to ensnare unhappy souls... 'transforms himself' as was said of Proteus,'into every shape'.81 Augustine certainly believes in demons and the power of the devil to ensoul statues with demons through the practice of theurgy.82 Although the role of sta- tues in theurgy was given fresh impetus in the Renaissance due to the rediscovery of the Corpus Hermeticum, and had a profound effect on the concept of sculpture during this period,83 it is important to remember that the key hermetic text which describes their empsychosis was as familiar in the later middle ages as it was in the age of Augustine. The Asclepius was known to the medieval West in the Latin translation of the pseudo-Apuleius, and was 'widely influential in the period'84 The Latin Asclepius was 'cited by Thierry of Chartres, Bernardus Silvestris, John of Salisbury and Alan of Lille'.85 While the Hofmannian comparison of Heurodis' position to that of 'a clockwork doll, usually left unwound, though occasionally allowed respite from her state of arrested mobility'86 is adroit, the fact that her reanimation is effected as mysteriously as her former immobile state is less sug- gestive of the body as a curiously wrought automaton than a demonically con- trolled autonomous statue, albeit one possessed of a soul that is not the Faerie King's to take.87 When we consider the probable date of the Auchinleck Manuscript, which, according to Helen Cooper 'cannot have been produced 81 Augustine, De civitate Dei, 10, 10 (The City of God, trans.

Perhaps in the wake of the notorious charges of idolatry and idolmaking levelled at Boniface VIII and the whiff of frankincense and sulphur surrounding the statues promoting his imperial cult of personality,89 we may note what Camille terms the 'veritable craze for accusations of image magic' particular to England and France during the early fourteenth century.90 This is indicative of a response to figural representation 'at the highest, most educated level of society, and not just for the illiterate masses of so-called popular religion', which had 'not changed radically since Augustine': The image is as terrifying as ever, now even more so, because making a portrait of someone entailed the possibility of manipulating them by magic... Balancing on the borderline between licit image-making and heretical idol making must have made the early fourteenth century a rather tentative time for both artists and patrons, and yet this was exactly the period when artistic innovation was at its height and secular rulers as well as popes sought to make representations that retaliated against their enemies, statues that announced their power and prestige on the model of the Romans.91 while demons might inhabit the human body', the source of a variety of phenomena,'only the Holy Spirit could dwell within the soul' 88 'Lancelot, Roger Mortimer and the Date of the Auchinleck Manuscript', in D'Arcy and Fletcher, Studies, 91-9: 95. 89 See L.

The otherworldly setting gives the Auchinleck narrator licence to explore the total identification of the demonic and the imperial embodied in its ruler, which is given poignant expression in the tragic potentiality of the statues within the walls. In this context, his presentation of these statues as emblematic of both demonic and imperial power is untrammelled by the dichotomous response to free-standing statues that characterises the Christian polity since its foundations, built from the spolia of classical culture. This has interesting connotations when we think of the contemporary state of church-state relations. The Auchinleck narrator is crafting his version of the Orfeo narrative in the wake of the imperium exerted over France and England by a self-fashioned icon already consigned in his own lifetime by Dante to hell as an idolatrous simoniac,92 who decreed that every human being must submit to his will because 'Ego sum Caesar: ego sum Imperator.93 Orfeo might well ask the Faerie King 'cur ita facis?' (Job 9: 12), to which the answer might well be that ascribed to the plenitudo potestatis of papal authority by such hierocratic theorists as Aegidius Romanus, James of Viterbo, Hostiensis, and Augustinus Triumphus: 'Because I can.'94 Yet, as J. R. Strayer points out,'When Boniface VIII, alarmed by the growing power of lay governments, tried to limit their authority, he found that he was too late. The people of France and England remained loyal to their kings'95 That Orfeo's people (typified by his faithful steward) stay loyal, coupled with Orfeo's defiance of the oppressive Faerie King point to the lambent, silent perseverance of 92 Inferno XIX, 112-14; cf. The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri I: Inferno, trans. J. D. Sinclair, rev. edn (Oxford, 1961), 36-7. 93 Francesco Pepino, Chronicon 47, Rerum Italicarum Scriptores, ed. L. A. Muratori, 28 vols (Milan, 1723-51), IX, 745. Whether or not this early fourteenth-century account is entirely accurate in wording has been the topic of some debate, but as A. Osiander points out, it 'does show what Boniface was thought capable of' ('Before Sovereignty: Society and Politics in ancien regime Europe' Review ofInternational Studies 27 (2001), 119-45: 129, n. 32). 94 Cf. B. Tierney, Foundations ofthe Conciliar Theory (Leiden and New York, 1998), 81-2, who notes that extreme papalists suggested that the Pontif's 'very will, without any rational justification, was sufficient to establish a binding law, and even his unjust commands were to be obeyed for no one on earth could say to him cur itafacis?' On the development of the concept see G. B. Ladner, 'The Concepts of "Ecclesia" and "Christianitas" and their Relation to the Idea of Papal "Plenitudo Potestatis" from Gregory VII to 'Boniface VIII', in Sacerdozio e Regno da Gregorio VII a Bonifacio VIII, Miscellanea Historiae Pontificiae 18 (Rome, 1954), 49-77; W.

That is the most wondrous of the 'meruails alle'. Moreover, the triumph of Orfeo has interesting implications in the light of the conflict between regnum and the twin swords of imperium in the early fourteenth century. Boniface's claim to plenitudo potestatis, pumped up by the hierocratic theory of the extreme papalists, is in turn challenged by Emperor Henry VII and his jurists, who spun the imperial assertions of Unam sanctam to their own equally convoluted ends, arguing that the holder of Roman imperium had rights, de jure and de facto over all western monarchies; such rights as the right of property because, as he puts it in the constitution Ad reprimendum, 'every human spirit must be subject to the Roman prince'96 Indeed, Henry VII, in the manner of Frederick II, issued a number of documents 'ex nostre plenitudine potestatis'.97 The principal political outcome of this posturing came in the wake of Henry's unsuccessful attempt to assert his overlordship over King Robert of Naples, swiftly followed by Clement V's bull, Pastoralis cura (14 March 1314) in which 'the universal overlordship of the emperor over kings and princes' was 'formally repudiated by the curia'.98 Thus it is possible to read Orfeo's repossession of the living body of his wife as a potent statement of sovereignty which is mirrored in his subsequent repossession of his body politic. This is not to suggest that a strict correspondence can be drawn between Boniface VII or Henry VII (or any other pope or emperor) and the Faerie King, any more than we can draw a strict correspondence between Orfeo's faithful steward, intrinsic to the fabric of the composition, and any one particular English regent during the latter half of the thirteenth century.99 However, as Charles T. Wood points out, the imperial assertions of Boniface's reign and Philip the Fair's subsequent demand for a posthumous heresy trial under Clement V (in addition to the arguments concerning sovereignty that reach their zenith in Clement's wranglings with Henry II) 'were recent, and that they were especially well known in England is suggested by the extent to which even modern knowledge of them depends on English reports and sources'.100 England had been resisting the fullest temporal implications of papal 96 W.

As to imperial assertions of dominion over England, such Anglo-Norman canonists as Alanus and Ricardus Anglicus or Richard de Mores, in addition to Vincentius Hispanus, voiced clear declarations of at least defacto independence of England from the emperor as early as the mid-twelfth century. By the mid thirteenth-century the maxim Rex in regno suo est imperator regni sui (the king in his domain is as the emperor in his) had become a commonplace found in English canonists and chroniclers, in one form or another, countenancing claims made on the part of pope and emperor alike.102 It is this spirit of sovereignty, which is rooted in a vision of Winchester as the source of native, ancient natural custom - as opposed to the imposition of an artificial imperium in imperio by the Faerie King - that is initially threatened then reaffirmed in Sir Orfeo: Now King Orfeo newe coround is, &amp; his quen, Dame Heurodis, &amp; liued long after-ward, &amp; sekpen was king pe steward. (11. 593-6) The idea of sovereignty embodied in Rex in regno suo est imperator regni sui was further developed in the early decades of the fourteenth century by such jurists as Bartolus of Sassoferrato, especially during the debate that ensues after the conflict between Henry VII and Robert of Naples, which leads Oldradus de Ponte in his Consilium 43 'to deny that an emperor had plenitudo had found imitation of papal precedent an attractive way for increasing the likelihood that Edward II's downfall would be seen, understood, and above all accepted within a context which included more than mere diffidation' (50-1).

However, it was not only known by Alanus Anglicanus, but also in England 'in the first decades of the thir- teenth century'; cf. Matthew Paris, Chronica majora, ed. H. R.

However, at the close of Sir Orfeo the Faerie King still inhabits his role of a demonic kosmokrator who will continue to grant himself the de facto power as self-appointed lord of the world to expropriate at will those whom he considers subaltern in status to him, or even their chattels. Indeed, there is nothing in the poem to indicate that his collecting days are over just because of his unprecedented encounter with Orfeo: the adage that once a collector always a collector has an intensely atemporal resonance in this instance. Yet Orfeo's double act of repossession challenges his de jure authority; it endorses the maxim rex in regno suo est imperator regni sui which underpins the idea of sovereignty nurtured by a succession of Anglo-Norman and British canonists from the anonymous author of the Summa Lipsiensis to Alanus, Gilbertus and Ricardus, John of Wales, and also the Irishman John of Fintona. However, in the context of Sir Orfeo it is important to remember that such maxims were not confined to the rarefied concentric spheres inhabited by canonists and theologico -political theorists: Innumerable statements of a similar sort could be found in official records. This means that everyone who attended a royal court, everyone who did business with the government, was exposed to the new theories. This must have done a great deal to spread the idea of the supremacy of royal government, and hence, to make laicization easier.104 The reappropriation of Heurodis from the human bricolage of the Faerie King's Kunstkammer that we find in the Auchinleck Manuscript is a bravura act of diffidatio in the face of the most unjust ruler of all. It is also a powerful symbol of personal and national sovereignty in the face of the imperial overreaching of any princeps 'Al were he mytre, croune, or diademe' and the demonic potential inherent in the misappropriation of that truly other- worldly concept of plenitudo potestatis.105 University ofLeicester 103 Ullmann, 'Development' 28.
