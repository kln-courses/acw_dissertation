<plain_text><page sequence="1">Derek Cohen. Searching Shakespeare: Studies in Culture and Authority. Toronto and Buffalo: University of Toronto Press, 2003. xvi + 195 pp. index. bibl. $50. ISBN: 0-8020-8778-7. Cohen's introduction is a stirring preview of his book: "Literary criticism is always about undercurrents and implications .... Attempting to lay bare this</page><page sequence="2">1522 RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY concealed but teeming life in the plays, the critic finds himself drawn into strange, dark, and exciting places by the agency of words" (xi). With such a resounding declaration of purpose, the book is bound to seem disappointing. Although Cohen is always passionate in his arguments and writes well, the book doesn't reveal any "strange, dark, and exciting places." Cohen places a strong emphasis on history, and he is indebted to the anthropological theories of Ren6 Girard, especially on the scapegoat. One of the problems of Searching Shakespeare is that Cohen's magisterial arguments sometimes slide over an accurate reading of the plays. It is a small point, but one worth making, that Gloucester's eyes in act 3, scene 7 of King Lear are not both gouged out or plucked out, as Cohen says. He is carried away by his own rhetoric when he says: "Yet, as Gloucester's eyes are torn from their sockets, they instantaneously become objects of horrible revulsion: their innate properties are gruesomely exposed - they are glassy, bloody, venous, and squishy" (166). This has no relation to any possible staging of the scene. In the text, Gloucester's first eye is sadistically crushed by Cornwall: "Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot" (3.7.69). Only his second eye is gouged out by Cornwall: "Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly" (3.7.84). It seems unlikely that in the theater the eyeball could actually be prized or plucked out, as Cohen asserts. A more serious problem of sliding over what the text actually says is in chapter 3 "Slave Voices: Caliban and Ariel." Here Cohen goes beyond the wildest post- colonialist interpretations of The Tempest by claiming that both Caliban and Ariel are slaves, seemingly in the nineteenth-century sense of the word, like black slaves in the Belgian Congo. There is a good deal of theory about slavery in this chapter, especially the views of Hegel, but essentially Cohen exploits contemporary terrorist rhetoric when he speaks of Caliban's rape of Miranda as a political act. In other words, it is "an indirect means of hurting someone other than the actual victim. The rape of Miranda was also, surely, a direct attack on the tyranny of her father" (59). Cohen skips over Caliban's servility to Stephano and Trinculo - surely this has little semblance to a political act. What I object to is the way that Cohen makes Caliban into a strikingly sympathetic if not actually lovable figure. About Ariel as a slave I think that Cohen is badly off. Ariel is a spirit like Mephistopheles in Marlowe's Doctor Faustus and not a human being. Ariel spe- cifically advises Prospero in act 5, scene 1 to feel sympathy for his captives. Ariel's "affections / Would become tender" "were I human" (5.1.18-19, 20). But, of course, Ariel is not human. In his avidity to pursue his argument about slavery, Cohen fudges Ariel's status as a spirit: "While it may reasonably be argued that Ariel is defined by the text as a spirit, not as a human being, it must also be recognized that Ariel has a strange but surely real corporeal identity, which makes judging him in anthropomorphic terms inevitable" (47). Which is also true of the corporeal identity of the actors who play the Weird Sisters in Macbeth and the Ghosts of Banquo, Hamlet's Father, and Julius Caesar.
