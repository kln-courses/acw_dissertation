A solo ecology: the erratic art of Andy Goldsworthy David Matless and George Revill Introduction This Goldsworthy essay draws (Figure on an 1) interview in Penpont, conducted Dumfriesshire, with the British Scotland, land in sculptor March Andy 1993. Goldsworthy (Figure 1) in Penpont, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, in March 1993. Goldsworthy grew up on the edge of Leeds, attended art college at Bradford and Lancaster, and lived in Brough and Langholm before moving to Penpont in 1986.1 We found him in his studio, an old two-storey mill building near his house. Works and children's toys lay around the floor. The interview was recorded in the small adjoining office. The conversation proceeded in a natural light veering from bright to gloomy during hail showers. After a couple of hours' talking, Goldsworthy drove with us up the Scaur valley, showing sites of recent work, and visiting his small plot of land, Stone Wood. Unless otherwise stated, quotations in this essay are from the interview. Figure 1 ~ 'Frans Hals Museum, Haarlem, August 1984'; repro- duced in Friedman and Goldsworthy, Hand to earth, p. 24. Ecumene 1995 2 (4) Goldsworthy talked freely to us about his work. On occasion, though, particularly early on, his language echoed previous pub- lished statements. When faced with the same old questions repetition is reason- able, but such precise phrasing indicates Goldsworthy' s thinking through of his work, and his strong hand in its interpretation.

Goldsworthy was curious that we were geographers, and while this essay does not claim any distinct geographical reading of his art, it raises matters of place, land- scape, and physical process which most typically emerge from the culture of geogra- phy. Studying Goldsworthy's work, and especially meeting him to discuss it, can be a disarming exercise. Goldsworthy has a disarming outlook on things. While not uncrit- ical of the world, he inhabits it with a sense of wonder and trust in physical and human process. As such he can be awkward to write about, tending to elicit either uncritical praise or dismissal as a naïve nature-artist turning away from the contempo- rary world. In seeking a different stance we take a cue from his own practice, in devel- oping a criticism which works not on but through the material. We begin by outlining the methods, materials, and social environment of his art, allowing the language of individual works to take over as the essay proceeds. Such a procedure is best caught by an acoustic metaphor. Our intention has been to draw out Goldsworthy's work, allowing it to resound. In writing through the material, the essay seeks to parasitically inhabit the work as both critical bug and useful amplifier, broadcasting it onto differ- ent ground and critically connecting it into concerns of geography: place, society, time, physical process. Goldsworthy's art does not answer questions of geography, somehow offering a truth we've all missed, but erratically connects discrete areas of enquiry. Enquiring of the world through an echo chamber, through the call and response of different places and substances,3 Goldsworthy offers an erratic sounding geography. Working place 'No ideas but in things' Goldsworthy adopts a practical approach. Art is to be gained through a routine of hard work: 'I go out and I make my work ... I am not a great teacher ... all I can say is, do your work first. I go out and I work every day. It is very important just to touch, touch, touch.' When not engaged on a commission elsewhere, he works close to his Penpont home, leaving the house early to work outdoors in all weathers and seasons, walking or driving to the surrounding hills, farms, estates, and rivers. Goldsworthy welcomed the move to Penpont as taking him beyond England's trespass law - in Scotland there is no equivalent general legal restriction - yet a picture of free-roam- ing access ('In Scotland you can go anywhere') may be overly simplistic. His work depends on the co-operation of farmers and landowners, notably the Buccleuch Estates, from whom he has leased two-and-a-half acres at Stone Wood for thirty-three years. The Earl of Dalkeith, son of the Duke of Buccleuch, has commissioned his work. Goldsworthy developed his outdoor methods while an art student at Lancaster.4 The sands and mudflats of Morecambe Bay drew his art: 'it felt real whereas the stu- dio didn't feel real, as if I wasn't dealing with real things. Just the idea of things.' Goldsworthy contrasts a partitioned and competitive art college to a freedom of the beach: Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="3">A solo ecology: the erratic art of Andy Goldsworthy 425 I felt the sand, I knew the sand somehow in a way that I didn't know before I had worked. I knew the tide, I hadn't before I worked ... I was beginning to learn because of what I was making ... up to then my art had just been expressing ideas, whereas now it became an art that taught me . . . through my hands. Goldsworthy's claim to generate art through a direct engagement with materials simultaneously foregrounds the artist's hand yet withdraws from preconceived design. Goldsworthy rates the modernist William Carlos Williams as his favourite poet, and his art practises Williams' dictum 'No ideas but in things'.5 Goldsworthy also looks to the modernist sculptural tradition of Constantin Brancusi (1856-1957), whose direct carving rejected distinctions of conception and execution, the engage- ment of hand and material producing a form out of the moment of carving.6 The stress on intellectual generation through material labour distances Goldsworthy from the more historically referential environmental art of a sculptor like Ian Hamilton Finlay.7 A high modernist purity and sparseness is recalled in Goldsworthy's formal reper- toire. On Morecambe Beach he adopted a basic geometry to focus on material rather than design: 'So I don't think about the shape. I am just interested in the making.' Striking geometry highlights both tactile and visual texture. As in Richard Long's landart, a limited geometric vocabulary highlights differences of material and site.8 Goldsworthy has deployed the cone, the arch, the patch, the circle, the line, the hole. Holes break and highlight earth, slate, brick and mud, linoleum, peat, clay, leaf, stone.9 Goldsworthy and Long connect to a longer tradition, strong in Britain, of grounded abstraction, of which the landed geometry of Paul Nash's landscape paint- ing and photography is the strongest twentieth-century example.10 Osmosis : art and place Goldsworthy shapes his routine as an engagement with the rhythms of a rural society: 'the rhythm of my own life, the rhythm of the daily life of the village and the rhythm of the day and the season, within the rhythms of nature. I can't possibly understand those rhythms if I don't have rhythm in my own work.' Through such harmonic reso- nance Goldsworthy sees his art as working the land, setting his work up as emerging from a practical engagement rather than a detached objectification. Goldsworthy seeks to cultivate such rhythm in all his workplaces. Cyclical agrarian rhythm - diur- nal, seasonal - is held to cut across cultural boundaries. The village rather than the city appears as a global form of settlement.11 The film Two autumns1 2 portrays Goldsworthy working in and alongside farming communities in Penpont and Japan. Structured as a day, the film shows places' work, rest, and play through 'Early morn- ings', 'Mornings', 'Middays', 'Afternoons', and 'Evenings'; the rhythm of rural rou- tine is joined to a work-ethical contact with material. Goldsworthy's approach to place works through a dialectic of familiarity and fresh- ness. Routine is valued, and immediately sought when encountering somewhere new. Research is, however, resisted: 'I like to solve all the difficulties and problems in the new place in the work ... I would forfeit the joy of freshness if I tried to spend a month researching first.' New places are not, however, explored as uncharted territo- ry: 'Before I move to a place I read the map. Before I came here I discovered this place by looking at the map.' Goldsworthy reads maps as codes which do not lay a Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="4">426 David Matless and George Revill place bare: as signposts, possessing the reticence as well as the eloquence of the names on a signpost. 'People have asked if the titles to my work are intended as poet- ry and I usually say no, they are intended like place names. If they have a sense of poetry then it is the poetry of place names.' Two autumns offers a social picture of a local Goldsworthy. Children in Penpont school assembly are told of Mr Goldsworthy's 'special eye ... He sees things that we don't see'13 Goldsworthy's art works socially through particular figurations of the artist. At times he appears a naïve catalyst for random process, hurling sticks in the air to see what happens, letting snowballs melt and seeing what flows. Elsewhere he comes over as a figure of craft, whose dextrous hands make leafworks and ice sculp- ture beyond the ordinary mortal. In both roles Goldsworthy appears to produce spe- cial knowledge, doing things others would be too worldly-wise or clumsy to attempt, a figure of both intricate knowledge and wondering innocence. Goldsworthy takes on aspects of the mystic and the fool,14 an innocent outside conventional modes of knowing yet not necessarily subverting them. Foolish practice can inhabit the same ground as local farming, living in the everyday yet marked out from it. Goldsworthy professes a general sympathy towards the Green movement,15 and his engagement with place is a consciously social one. Rather than marking his terrain as 'politicar, however, he aims to inhabit society as an artist in ecological relationship: 'My aim is to make a work, a good work, as good a work as I can, that can speak for itself and that takes all my energy. I can't dress the work up as community action.' Goldsworthy's art emerges from everyday space, yet is marked out from it in order to enter into dialogue. Art and everyday life constitute parallel spaces of constant osmo- sis.16 The sometimes barely perceptible permeable barrier between the two is crucial to both sides: 'I have worked in some places where I have felt intimidated by the place, or haven't felt comfortable with people . . . and the work has become very, very small.' Goldsworthy is less concerned to broadcast to the world than connect to it in an ecological web: 'I don't feel as if I am trying to convert anybody, or tying to put across anything. The social nature of my work runs much deeper than that, it is an everyday living, breathing part of what I make. I am not interested in doing work- shops.' The environment of art Goldsworthy's work forms a dialogue with land: 'I suppose the counterpoint for me is the land. It really is the thing by which I measure most things.' Land for him is worked nature, and to remake nature in art is in no sense 'unnatural': I am part of nature, I don't see myself as being in opposition, and I think it's a strange idea to see us as separate from nature. Our lives and what we do affect nature so closely that we cannot be separate from it ... It is the way of nature to be used, worked and touched . . . This is a good thing if it's done well, with respect . . .17 Goldsworthy's art is not a naïve celebration: 'In many ways my approach to the earth has been a reaction against the abuse of the land by the industrial farmer'.18 If he seeks to encourage change though, it is via joy rather than anger. The works bring out particular pleasures, which might reconfigure senses of environment. There is an attempt to appeal directly to the senses, through pattern, colour, incongruity. The Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="5">A solo ecology: the erratic art of Andy Goldsworthy 427 work signals itself through a pleasant disturbance of expectations, after which the world, in an altered state, resettles. Goldsworthy's emphasis on the local echoes the work of Common Ground, whose work since 1983 has offered a culture and aesthetic of the local environment cutting across distinctions of urban and rural, traditional and modern.19 Goldsworthy has produced several works for Common Ground, sharing their emphasis on beginning where you are, tapping and making local knowledges. The modernist vernacular of William Carlos Williams' Paterson catches such localism: To make a start, out of particulars and make them general, rolling up the sum, by defective means-20 This is no withdrawn localism, no beginning locally never to move, but an assertion of the local as a universal particular: 'itself, locally, and so like every other place in the world'.21 A local is everywhere, and different locals may come together in their difference on a general, plural common ground. Goldsworthy's sense of the local is both highlighted and challenged by the eco- nomic environment of his art. His work might appear and appeal to many as a lived critique of contemporary urban existence, a critical retreat from the city. Yet it exists within a set of wider economic relationships, which interrupt yet underpin and enable local routine. His works are an increasingly valuable commodity on the inter- national art market; commercial success enables him to prosper in Penpont yet increasingly takes him around the world to work other rhythms of culture and nature. Goldsworthy gives such travel a guarded, almost grudging welcome: My own place is the most important to me and all these trips abroad shouldn't give people the impression that I need to go to exotic or foreign places to make things work . . . Left to myself, I work here . . . This is the place I can see through the seasons and when I travel I lose a chance of change. I see different places but I don't see real change. When we visited he was about to travel to London on business, having enjoyed, for the first time in five years, spending three months in Penpont watching 'winter becoming spring': T am going to time travel down there. I resent that.' Goldsworthy supports the local routines of home by working other spatial rhythms, flows of capital culture. Northness Goldsworthy lived and worked in the north of England before moving to Scotland. The move was less to a new country than to another part of north Britain. The north- ward biographical trajectory is echoed in Goldsworthy's presentation of northness as a constant companionable direction for his work, an almost archetypal sense of place connecting particular sites to the orientation of the earth. Northness is most obviously expressed in the iceworks made on an Arctic trip in March and April 1989: 'The further north I go the stronger its presence. I want to fol- low north to its source - to try to come to terms with it'.22 In three days at the North Pole Goldsworthy sculpted 'Touching north', four vertical rings looking into a cen- tral point, a compass rose with all points south. Northness is sculpted as a magnetic Ecumene 1995 2(4)</page><page sequence="6">428 David Matless and George Revill archetype, the Pole 'more of a feeling than a place ... the earth's common'.23 Goldsworthy's archetypal cardinal geography again conjures up a childlike eye, with Jack Frost blowing a snowy enchantment down from the north. Goldsworthy terms the pole 4 the place that generated the cold that made winter'.24 Strict adherence to scientific meteorology is not the issue here; Goldsworthy figures his enchanted world through a sense of north. Northness also inhabits parts of everywhere in the northern hemisphere, at or above temperate latitudes: 'North is an integral part of the landscape that I already work with. I can touch north in the cold shadow of a mountain, the green side of a tree, the mossy side of a rock ... its energy is made visible in snow and ice'.25 The geo- graphical archetype might be extended historically, taking in the moulding cold of glaciation coming down to scour the hills and valleys around Penpont. Monument to production: seven spires Beside a rough track in Grizedale Forest stand seven tall, pyramidal towers of spruce, just visible within an enclosing stand of mature pines (Figure 2). 26 Each Spire is formed from twenty or so poles. At the base each is 1-1.5 metres in circumference; at the top the Spires taper to touch the crown of the forest. Undertaken in 1984, this was Goldsworthy's first large-scale commission. Grizedale, in the southern part of the English Lake District, is a commercial forest run by the Forestry Commission. Currently holding more than sixty sculptures by various artists, it has become a model for ' multiple-use' forestry, combining public access, tourism, the arts and wildlife management with economically viable timber production.27 The Seven Spires echo the rectilinear working landscape of commercial forestry. Formed from productive surplus, tall, straight, sound timber arranged vertically, the sculpture displays Grizedale's productive capacity. The form reflects both the storage of spruce poles, cut and dressed for agricultural use, and the verticality of the living plantation. The Spires respond to the forest's role in tourism, functioning as an elab- oration of forestry and an invitation into the forest. One Spire is visible from the path, beckoning the visitor into the site of production. To encounter all seven you must leave the track and walk in the dull light among the trees. The calculated arti- fice of the work guides the experience of the forest. During our visit a school party scavenged the site, making artwork from the debris of the forest floor; twigs, leaves, discarded wire, pine-cones, fencing stakes. Duration Goldsworthy presents his work as contributing to and playing off the landscape, echo- ing W. G. Hoskins's notion of landscape as palimpsest,28 his own work adding the lat- est layer in a creative processing of land: 'layers, that is probably a word I use as much as you do . . . the difference is that I am a participant' (we dissented from the latter) . Goldsworthy regards his temporary and permanent works as dialectically bound: 'The permanent works . . . draw from the ephemeral . . . There has been a lot of graft in leaves and ice and stone . . . before I touch the stone for a permanent work'.29 Goldsworthy is preoccupied with temporality, and shows little interest in materials Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="7">A solo ecology: the erratic art of Andy Goldsworthy 429 Figure 2 ~ 'Seven spires', Grizedale Forest, Cumbria; photograph by George Revill, March 1993.

Different senses of time, however, are operative in the temporary and permanent works, and in the photography which records them. Realization and decay Goldsworthy is perhaps best known for his temporary work; delicate constructions of leaves, sticks, ice, and sand which are bound to collapse or decay. Works may be made for a 'peak' moment of realization, brought to life, for example, at a particular angle of the sun. A chain of leaves launched into a stream enjoys only a brief com- pleteness. But such realization is always within an acceptable cycle of erosion and decay. Leaf constructions sag, snow works melt, and he returns to document their biodégradation. While Goldsworthy's permanent works remain on the topography, the temporary works linger in the humus of the land: 'I don't feel as if the work has ever entirely gone, even though it has melted, or decayed. It hasn't gone completely, it is still there, it is still somehow part of that place.' Such work is presented as enriching the existing organic litter of the land, adding to its potential. Goldsworthy recalled visit- ing an archaeological dig: 4 It was ten feet deep. This was how deep life had been . . . and it is not just human life. Each season leaves a layer, each year leaves a layer, each animal does, so my works are just like that.' History progresses here through living and dying continuities. Photography Temporary works are documented and sold through photography. Goldsworthy first employed photography as a student to explain his work; it has since become his art's chief conveyance. Most photographs are taken by himself; others, mainly those show- ing him at work, by an assistant, often his wife, Judith. Image-enhancing techniques are avoided. One or two images showing the work at its 'peak' are selected for public consumption and sale.30 While Goldsworthy is typically reflective on his photographic practice,31 he has yet publicly to address the impact of the photograph-as-commodity on the aesthetic of his work. The photograph presents a work made away from a public eye. It is preferred to the painting or drawing as 'it never leaves the moment it was taken'. Change and decay are absent but implicit. To reach its 'peak' the work must have been built up, and after peaking can only decay. Goldsworthy cites as an early influence a 1960 pho- tograph of the avant-garde 'New Realist' Yves Klein leaping off a wall, 'le saut dans le vide', ('into the void'), caught in mid-air fall, while an old man obliviously bicycles 32 past; 'a suspended moment that intrigued me'. While the photograph neglects senses other than the visual, Goldsworthy suggests that such absences might ring the viewer's memory: 'If they have the memory of run- ning water, or the wind, or the leaves of the trees . . . They can often draw from that well of experience.' The viewer can both admire and take some of the finish off the image. The photograph's temporality calls up a supplement. Goldsworthy regards photography as central to contemporary memory: 'the photograph is such a complex part of the way we live ... it has become part of a way of defining time passing'. The 'photoworks', sharply co-present with the viewer yet stained with another time, open Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="9">A solo ecology: the erratic art of Andy Goldsworthy 431 a space which may or may not be easily filled. The viewer is obliged to follow Goldsworthy' s practice of working through the material. The integral role of photography extends to pieces displayed indoors, for example the intricate leaf constructions shot against a bare background in strong light (Figure 3).33 For Goldsworthy the camera here enlivens the object, restoring life to a thing made outdoors and brought in, dry and static. The photograph is 'the liquid* refreshing a ł dried-out' object, much as a drab dry shell or stone becomes vivid when placed under water: 'Wet is a word I could apply to the photograph, moist, full of water. The one thing that you lose when you come inside with anything is the mois- ture . . . the photograph retains its moisture.' The technology of the camera restores outdoor vapour to a leafwork's surface and veins, restoring it to its moment of mak- ing, dewing it back to its dawn. A postcard, rather than the object on the table, brings you closer to the original.34 Figure 3 ~ 'Drumlanrig sweet chestnut', autumn 1988, 13 in. tall; reproduced in Goldsworthy, Leaves , p. 39. Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="10">432 David Matless and George Revill Monuments Permanent works in stone, earth, and wood work their space for longer duration:35 'I am making something which is going to be here for a long time and I don't take that responsibility lightly. I spend a lot of time at the site, I draw a lot, I do everything that I don't normally do.' Goldsworthy considers it no 'accident' that the majority of such works are within his home region, planting personal meaning across north Britain, and plans a sequence of works 'far enough apart so they can be reached in a long, hard, single day's run. If in years to come a five-monument fell run was established I would be delighted.'36 In embracing decay Goldsworthy has participated in a critique of monumental sculpture, yet his permanent works have their own monumentalism. These durable works are made to hold their form, unlike, for example, the mutable woodworks of his friend and sometime teacher David Nash; the seasoning of timber in Nash's oak boxes alters their form, while the growing, bent-over trees of his 'Fleched over ash dome' directs the work's evolution.37 Goldsworthy's more rigid monuments owe more to American land artists like Robert Smithson, whose 'Spiral jetty' he cites as an early influence.38 That said, formal rigidity can itself be used to comment on external forces of change. Goldsworthy has built cairns to record flood levels,39 and unsuccess- fully proposed a grimly humorous time-marking line of stones running perpendicu- lar from an eroding cliff edge towards a threatened town.

Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="11">A solo ecology: the erratic art of Andy Goldsworthy 433 and passing time are also combined at Ile de Vassivière in France, where two stone- walled folds on a lakeshore enclose trees on the land and a patch of the water (Figure 4); the one will be undermined by roots, the other by liquid. The reservoir drowned the landscape of eight villages; a fold extends into the water and back, turning from the fate of other walls but itself set to be eroded by 'the tension between lake and land.'40 Goldsworthy's durable work departs from conventional notions of monumentality: 4 1 would use the word monuments ... as a way of turning on its head the idea of mon- uments, because they are not made in the spirit of wanting to rather arrogantly mark a place.' These are not to be monuments to their maker: 'Monuments are usually to people and not to places . . . my monuments are monuments to walling, to places, to the wind, or the season.' Such works hope to sustain the processes to which they refer, not to become future memorials to lost vernacular arts. They engage with topography in part through formal resonance. Walling works bring existing forms in the landscape to a higher pitch. At Stone Wood, Goldsworthy was bound by contract to mark the boundary with the neighbouring farmer's land, and hired local waller Joe Smith to construct a looped, dry-stone 'Give and take wall'41 which effectively places a part of Goldsworthy's land on the farmer's side of the wall, and vice versa, a transgression limited and bounded. The wall appears almost knotted, emphasizing contract, a monument to practical property relations. Sheep have cropped the turf on the closed-off part of Stone Wood, while willow saplings sprout in Goldsworthy's loop. Monuments also connect through historical reference. At Gateshead, Goldsworthy made a 10-foot cone of circles of scrap steel in a public park, on the site of a former foundry overlooking the Tyne, which in its subsequent rust would stand for the area's de-industrialization.42 The latter point ironically struck home when the sculpture almost entered the post-industrial economy, two local men being caught in the act of loading it onto a lorry for sale as scrap. Only after arrest did they learn of the £34,000 43 pnce tag. Reference and resonance combine in two earth works in Co. Durham, on the line of a disused railway. The quarter-mile serpentine work at Lambton and the circular maze at Leadgate44 have an archaeological air, seeming excavated as much as raised. Paul Nash's reading of a modernism in the geometry of earthworks and hill-forts again provides a parallel.45 Historical resonance builds a distance and enigma into a contemporary art of local abstraction: The earthworks . . . are made along ... a disused railway which I have begun to see as a river of earth. If the Lambton Earthwork is made on a fast-flowing part of the line, then at Leadgate the earth has formed a deep pool, dammed by the road. The rings are as ripples from a thrown stone - an echo of a maze formed by the coalmining directly below it, deep down.46 At Lambton, Goldsworthy's reluctance to research local history produced a curious lacuna. The earthwork was made without knowledge of the longstanding local ser- pent legend of the Lambton Worm. While generally happy for his works to attract local names and meanings, Goldsworthy might resent a loss of symbolic openness if the work were labelled a giant worm. Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="12">434 David Matless and George Revill Land form: Barfil Farm In a field by Barfil Farm, off the Dumfries-Castle Douglas road, there is a circular dry-stone wall, about 20 feet in diameter, 5 feet high, with a small gap allowing entry into a space of bare rock (Figures 5 and 6). Outside the wall is pasture, inside is bedrock. We drove down the farm track in late afternoon, the sun beginning to go, the odd hard sleet shower blowing over. We had been told how to reach the piece. There are no signs: this exposed work is secluded, for the private view of those who work on the farm, a vernacular version of a landed estate's folly or temple. We asked at the house where it was. A farmworker enthusiastically lent boots for the mud and led us to the work, saying what a brilliant thing it was, and telling us of its making. The landscape is low pasture, bumpy but horizontal, old but lush, low Silurian. The piece is on a downslope west from the small farmhouse, facing south, working with but at the same time enclosing the aspect. In the late March afternoon the piece shadowed along the slope. We walked to it to see inside, to view the geology under the pasture: T have just finished a work where I started with the tip of a rock in the field and dug down. I knew this was bedrock and I dug the bedrock out. It was a geological dig.' The piece took two weeks to make, the earth stripped around the tip, the rock display extended for the diameter, the wall built from surface stones of the same geology by Joe Smith, Goldsworthy's regular waller. D: This is open-cast sculpture/ A: T could think of better words for it.' The dig was documented, like any archaeology, by photographs, which show a process like the opening of a barrow. The piece is Goldsworthy's, the labour of it necessarily shared: the craft of the waller, the artist's design. The work sits in Barfil's field as monument, as shelter, as rock. How will it be known in the future? It seems nothing if not permanent. It could take on the air of visually similar prehistoric British sites, simply formed, with mystery attached, or might suggest something sacred in the protected rock, a Dome of the Rock in a Dumfriesshire field. Goldsworthy has no church affinities, but he says of the piece: Tt is very spiritual. You can go in there and it's this feeling of being back at the beginning.' How does it work monumentally, and what is it a monument to? The wall's masonry contrasts with the rough, fused, jointed rock inside. Barfil's is a region of upper Silurian grits, greywackes, flags, and shales. The wall closes and shel- ters a display of its own source. A person of average build can squeeze into the marked-out space through a gap, from the terrain of the grazing sheep onto that of the mountain goat. Like the Spires, this is a monument to its own material; to land- forms, to local rock. Not a geological showpiece, but a look at the vernacular archi- tecture of the earth.47 The piece is also a shelter. The gap makes it a sheepfold; the wall shields the rock as others shield stock. The piece nurtures through a masculine notion of care: of husbandry, shepherding; a monument to local farming as well as geology. Closure also makes of it a dark piece, shadowy. Walking in, you pass out of the green into that below, descending onto the rock. The sense of descent, though, is quickly reversed: the slope of the piece, the detail of the rock, suggest ascent. The piece brings a lower layer to the surface, to light. There is more emergence here than descent, rock laid down in an old sea waking. Ecumene 1995 2(4)</page><page sequence="13">A solo ecology: the erratic art of Andy Goldsworthy 435 The work has a strong verticaiity, of rock denied air poking up, accentuated by the south sun-facing aspect: 'When you are standing there you realize all those rhythms underneath you that you are not aware of, the stratas, the . . The wall makes it a pastoral fairground rotor ride, the rock feeling as though it might rise or fall away when you stand inside.

Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="14">436 David Matłess and George Revffl This could be said to go against the rock's sedimentary grain, making it more an igneous work, a Wurlitzer organ of a piece, rising from some earth's centre. The form works to suggest a metaphorical depth of geology, of rock being about deep earth rather than something popping up, mole-like, from just below the turf. The earth's inside announces itself, but the wall makes it only viewable from close up. From a few yards away the rock is hidden. Is this geology caged, on show? Yes and no. Seeing the enclosure gives a different sense to turf elsewhere, a sense that any out- crop is a glimpse of the writhed rock just under the green. The piece also works horizontally, translating vertical layers of land into surface spaces: ' there is a sheepfold in the field and you walk to the sheepfold, and then walk inside the sheepfold back to the beginning . . . There is no soil inside and there is soil outside.' Time is travelled through surface texture. Different durations adjoin, the time of rock formation and of soil formation. Different layers of the palimpsest are juxtaposed, divided by the wall. A cross-section diagram has been cut up and layers laid alongside, the wall dividing. And just as diagrammatic divides suggest quiet peri- ods, the wall is appropriately stoic. Erraticism: works of physical process G: Do you get anything from the Surrealists, the idea of displacing that which is common- place, trying to knock it sideways a little bit? A: Well I do it, but I don't know if it comes from Surrealism. It comes from glacial boul- ders. D: Erratics. A: I am definitely into the aesthetic of the erratic. Erraticism characterizes much of Goldsworthy's work. Elements of the incongruous, the surreal, that which is out of place but somehow in place, figure in his temporary and permanent endeavours. Goldsworthy's erratics are matter out of place, but celebrated rather than despised;48 indeed, they gather around them the space which they occupy. A glacial boulder wanders hundreds of miles in ice, sits down on new turf, and eccentrically belongs, a new found object, harmoniously transgressive Figure 7 ~ 'The Baron's Stone of Killochan: a granite boulder in the valley of the Girvan'; from Geikie, The scenery of Scotland , p. 344. Ecumene 1995 2 (4) (Figure 7) . Erraticism is at the heart of Goldsworthy's works of physical process. Such work can play on temporal disturbance, the erratic altering the flow of events by its presence. The governing princi- ple, however, is spatial eccentric belonging. Again, Klein's frozen leap provides a precedent; Goldsworthy also cites the influ- ence while a student of the American creator of 'Happenings', Allen Kaprow, and the wrap artist Christo. There is a</page><page sequence="15">A solo ecology: the erratic art of Andy Goldsworthy 437 further echo of Paul Nash, especially his photography of incongruous found objects and standing 'Stone personages'.49 Roger Cardinal describes Nash's 'green Surrealism'50 as being at once concerned with 'the surfaces of the workaday world . . . the jDoetic virtue of commonplace textures' and with 'dislocating the object of inter- est'. Nash's photography provides a catalogue of the erratic. The geologist Archibald Geikie wrote of the erratic granite boulders of Galloway, just west of Goldsworthy' s region: 'Some of these blocks make conspicuous landmarks or have received special names.'52 Goldsworthy's interventions, whether permanent or tempo- rary, make the contemporary erratic. Goldsworthy's working through material differs from Baconian science: 'I am not interested in categorizing nature, the scientific approach. I have the countryman's basic knowledge of it.'53 Goldsworthy is not anti-scientific, and values the dialogue of different knowledges. His own experimentalism draws on a wilfully inductive approach, cultivating an observational naivety. In Australia he made works in the morning in the shadow of a tree, aiming to catch the light in the afternoon: 'But the sun went the other way.' Goldsworthy delighted in learning about the hemispheres through naïve practical error: 'a wonderful way to find out . . . The moon was upside down too.' Happy not to know exactly what will happen when he does something, Goldsworthy embraces contingency and indeterminacy. His works are 'compositions' only in the sense of a 'composer' such as John Cage, whose music Goldsworthy admires, parameters being set only for the work to escape control. The degree of release given to a work varies; often indeterminacy is set up with care. Recent tempo- rary pieces, however, increasingly make themselves. Towards the end of our interview we discussed physical process. Goldsworthy's sense of geography was primarily as a physical science, and while he, like us, is no sci- entist, common imaginative ground soon appeared. The following passage may or may not display the unity of geography, as two human geographers fumble for mem- ories of the processes of coasts and soils: G: Have you ever thought of working with much slower process, for example, something like soil creep? A: Great idea, 'soil creep'. Wow. Can I use that title for an installation some time? Is that a technical term? 'Soil creep'! D: Those little ridges down a hillside ... A: I've got the idea for an exhibition. It can be a big wall, I will put wet sand up against one side and compact it a bit. Then I will cover it with a different colour sand and as it dries out it will begin to creep. Then there will be different fissures, would that be soil creep? G: Yes, that would be soil creep. D: I don't know the first thing about soil, but it's that kind of thing, very slow and differen- tial movement. The surface layer will obviously move quicker than the layer under- neath. G: And different sized grains move at different speeds ... I don't know whether you have ever worked with, for example, longshore drift . . . D: Tracing the movement of tides and currents with coloured floating markers . . . G: ... geographers put coloured balls into a stream or river [A: They do?] to examine rates of flow. A: Sounds very familiar to me. Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="16">438 David Matless and George Revill Goldsworthy then fished out transparencies of recently dyed streams: 'How do you think these pools are coloured?' Later he showed us the deeply incised stretch of the Scaur Water where the works happened. He had stained the stream with mud, scoop- ing handfuls from the bed and hurling them high to splash their orange-red into the flow.54 Grounddown local red sandstone had also been placed in the stream, either loose or coated around a stone. In the mud throws, the stain pauses on landing before shooting downriver. The red-rock coating can linger, let out in sudden bursts or drip action, like a rock itself doing the drawing, responding to flow and turbu- lence. Goldsworthy termed the placing of ground rock into water 'like drawing a stream', concurring with a comparison in method and aesthetic to Jackson Pollock. The river expresses its own force of abstraction. Colour is violently stretched and turned. Goldsworthy' s carefully placed gestures tap and show the force and texture of the Scaur. Patterns emerge and perish with speed, the water consuming that which it generates, showing the stream's ravelling and unravelling, its becoming turbulence. In a calmer stretch of stream Goldsworthy stained pools with the deep orange-red of stone scratched into dust. Colour extracted from the place stands out from the place. Goldsworthy talks of 'getting to the source of the red'; such works seek to bring a place to a higher pitch, paradoxically appearing almost as pollutants. The stained pools have a toxic beauty, malignant patches smothering the water, false colour garish in the dull valley. Goldsworthy presents the bright erraticism of these streamworks as part of a new strain in his work, concerned less to make an object than to instigate through incisive intervention. Such work connects to place less through osmosis than through surgery, less a new layer than an incision, a scar or stitch in its texture. Parallels have been drawn between such work and contemporary science, particu- larly chaos theory: 'Every so often I need to break the structures in which I work, lose control, and explore the unknown and random . . . The intention is not to tame chaos, but to tap its energy.'55 Richard Bright sees Goldsworthy sharing chaos theory's concern with nature as 'process and creative evolution':56 'There is always a delicate balance between stability and instability, between order and chaos, and this balance is never static, it is dynamic.'57 Energy proceeds from the unpredictability of process and form, heightening the need to work through the material rather than setting up an advance model of the work. Goldsworthy works not on a discrete object but in an already relational space: 'The energy and space around a material are as important as the energy and space within . . . When I touch a rock, I am touching and working the space around it. It is not independent of its surroundings.'58 Erraticism stands out only in interdependence. Goldsworthy taps physical process for parallels across scale and material: I think what I am trying to get underneath to is the driving force behind the stream, behind these things that are moving. That nature moves, that continents move is something that I know by what I know in ice, the way ice moves, the way ice flows come together and make mountains, the way a stone will melt under heat. I have made an installation with stones that are put into a kiln, that just begin to open up and I arrest the heating, and these cracked stones are put all over the floor. The idea of stone being like snow being like ice, these things interest me enormously, the movement and change in nature.

When, however, he refers to his work occasionally 'looking into the heart of nature',59 he is not calling up some secret hidden deep down, some grail or pot of gold. Goldsworthy's essentialism is one of transience, process, energy, and movement, to be touched in resemblance and reso- nance. His experimentalism aims not to discover scientific principle through artistic method but to produce other kinds of truth about physical process. His enquiry con- nects through transgression over different processes, different materials. Connect, through happy disturbance, via the erratic. Stains and debris: ice and snow drawings Goldsworthy's 'Ice and Snow Drawings' (Figure 8) bring together erraticism, memo- ry, place, topography. They depart from two earlier works. In April 1989 at Grise Fiord, Canada, Goldsworthy made drawings in seal and caribou blood, dripping onto paper the melt of snowballs made around the blood of beasts shot by his Innuit assistant and guide.60 From July to August 1989 Goldsworthy installed erratic 'snowballs in summer' in Glasgow's Old Museum of Transport.61 Eighteen large snowballs, made in Perthshire in late winter and packed around different materials, melted over five days, leaving their innards and a pool, making different stains and debris. A snow drawing was in its final stages when we visited Goldsworthy, lying on a bench being dried by a heater. A book, Ice and snow drawings , was published in 1992. Geology, soil, and topography are discussed and mapped in explanatory dialogue with the drawings. Four series are shown: Teaks and foothills' of the Lowther Hills; clay pits at Drumlanrig; Borrowdale ice and icicles; and the 'source of the Scaur'. Drawings proceed through a mix of intervention and indeterminacy. Material - earth, stone, berries - is mixed into a snowball or coated onto ice, and placed on paper to melt and stain. The process is documented photographically, and the draw- ing is not touched while in process: 'randomness has a very strong part in the work'.62 Drawing makes itself topographically: 'The paper reacted to die melting snow - buckling and forming a landscape in itself with hills, ridges and valleys.' The staining of paper corresponds to physical process outside: 'it's not that I am trying to mimic nature but they are the same processes, I am making these drawings the same way that the landscape is made, the action of snow and cold and water on paper.'64 An image of substance ('not only do they represent the Lowthers; they are the Lowthers'65), the drawing becomes a material metaphor for physical land-sculpture. The contours flatten when the work is dried and hung vertically. Goldsworthy directs the work through the material gathered, the type of paper chosen, the placing of snow or ice: 'Those drawings that did not match my experi- ence of a hill were rejected and in this respect I see them representing a place in the tradition of landscape painting and drawing.'66 Early attempts were mostly unsuccess- ful: 'They were not strong enough.' Mixed in the field, most colour had drained by the time the ball reached the paper: 'The resulting stains were too weak.' Later, earth and snow were joined 'just before their being given to the paper'.67 A small heater dries the melt: 'I dry the water off and you are left with this landscape with all shore- lines . . .'. Loose earth is brushed from the drawing with a feather, adding another Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="18">440 David Matless and George Revill Figure 8 ~ 'Peat', from the 'Source of Scaur' series of snowball drawings; reproduced in Goldsworthy, Ice and snow drawings , p. 58.

Heat prevents mould, and echoes the outside: 'heat is . . . important in these works . . . heat on the earth . . . draws out these processes . . . it's in the spirit of the work to be dried.' Heating resonates with seasonal change, bringing spring to release stored energy. G: You said that if you do not warm your ice drawings they go mouldy, do you think this would be such a bad thing? A: That would become another thing . . . but you only have to go one or two steps at a time. There is a wary indeterminacy here: 'I am cautious about introducing too much varia- tion in the way they are made. It could weaken the drawings and obscure the enor- mous differences between snowballs and places. I need to progress slowly even though I am aware of so many possibilities.' Work begins with a slight incision: The snowballs are put into the middle of the paper and all I do is stop them running over ... I am the initiator of the act but not the controller . . . my touch is a very slight but incisive touch, that goes in deep.'69 Strength does not proceed from stridency, or brawn, or bombast, but from working with flow, from tracing event, from containing and letting. The drawings take up a tenancy in the studio, Goldsworthy retaining the choice to keep or discard. Titled with their place-name, the drawings are made to echo physical geography. The Lowther Teaks and foothills' series pairs dark blacks and browns from hilltop peat and rock with wan yellows and quiet browns from below. The 'Source of the Scaur' series melt onto a sloping surface, echoing the river's setting off: 'After mak- ing the first of this series, I took the train from Kirkconnel to Glasgow . . . the river was in spate, bursting its banks . . . and flooding the fields. It was like travelling through a drawing.'70 The drawings hint at a distillation of place, supplementing rich- ness, as in any distillery. Bold or pale, rich or thin, these are concentrates of a place laid down; peat black, stone crimson, stone yellow, berry blue, slate grey, clay orange, a curious colour catalogue of nature. Goldsworthy admires Yves Klein's monochrome paintings, images of vivid 'International Klein Blue';71 Penpont holds a similar inten- sity. This is not dead pigment, torn from substance; the drawings retain an energy, showing the flow patterns of their formation, veins, and traces. Less relic than embry- onic, these are specimen pictures of places caught in a half-life, solids made fluid, blood out of stones. Conclusion In conclusion we wish to highlight some actual or potential contradictions in Goldsworthy' s work deriving from his own strong presence in his art. Performance There is a strong performative strand in Goldsworthy' s art; technique is often detailed in the title of a piece, and Goldsworthy frequently shows himself at work (Figure 9). Goldsworthy various appears as a loner in all weathers, private family man, delicate leaf-stitcher, hard-headed farmworker, committed Green dripping seal Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="20">442 David Matless and George Revill Figure 9 ~ (a) 'Wet sand cupped, squeezed, thrown out of water', Lake Michigan, August 1991; photograph by Judith Goldsworthy; reproduced in Goldsworthy, Stone , p. 58.

Such multiplicity may create tensions in a work consistently presented as forming one body. We turn to these below, but it is worth highlighting first the common though varied masculinity of his presence. Goldsworthy produces his art through variants of masculinity. In his more gestural works he exercises the solo masculinity of the avant garde, alone in nature, standing out from society, though always able to return to a family home. Goldsworthy cited in interview the early influence of performance art, notably of Joseph Beuys's 1965 'How to explain pictures to a dead hare': Beuys, head coated in honey, cradled the hare, silently mouthing on art.72 Goldsworthy' s early outdoor performances in the mudpools of Morecambe Bay are prefigured by Beuys's 1971 'Bog action', the artist skipping over or submerged in a boggy landscape.73 Peter Wollen argues that in rela- tion to environmentalism Beuys shifted 'the optical 4 and semiotic field of art towards a new, and potentially troubling, theatricality'. 4 Again, Goldsworthy's environmental art connects beyond obvious horizons. A certain masculinity also guides Goldsworthy's more crafted works, whether the sturdy wall or the delicate leafwork; the work takes place in an artisanal sphere away from the domestic. Goldsworthy would seem wary of senses of decoration convention- ally deemed feminine: 'It is difficult for a sculptor to work with petals, flowers, and leaves because of their decorative associations.'75 In sculpting flowers Goldsworthy would seem not to challenge distinctions of masculine formality and feminine deco- ration but to gather new material into a masculine sense of sculpture. Flowers and stone are worked in common as 'the flesh and bones of nature'.76 The fleshing out of the flower is echoed in a substantiation of colour: 'Colour for me is not pretty or dec- orative - it is raw with energy.'77 The resistance to a particular version of the feminine here may be echoed in a resistance to seeing environment as a realm of sentimentali- ty; Goldsworthy deals in seal blood as well as flowers. Northness, too, might be read as the most masculine of cardinal points, historic direction of a male romanticism in art and exploration. Goldsworthy does not, however, overtly feminize nature. He does Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="21">A solo ecology: the erratic art of Andy Goldsworthy 443 not present an artistic masculinity ranging and working over a passive or tempestuous female material. While he works forces conventionally regarded as both feminine and masculine, his resistance to formal anthropomorphism and his wariness of the figura- tive extend to a caution over any gendering of nature. The erratic artist Tensions appear in relation to Goldsworthy's place as an individual in a community, and between the avant-garde and craft strains in his work. Both, however, may be negotiated if Goldsworthy himself is figured as an erratic. Goldsworthy inhabits Penpont as an erratic fixture come from outside; moving around the world, he touches down in temporary osmosis, an erratic carried on com- mission. Harmoniously transgressive as a glacial boulder, Goldsworthy asserts a con- cerned connection to place while resisting a commitment to a community art. The social-ecological connections emphasized in his political Greenness proceed through an individual artistic practice; erraticism enables him to work the paradox of a solo ecology. Erraticism negotiates the working of both careful craft and avant-garde gesture by giving the latter particular senses of care and purpose. Goldsworthy's stress on inci- sion denotes a careful touch; precise, deliberate, a careful lying down on a rock in the rain to leave his own outline, an exploration of throwing technique. An air of experimentalism connects these works to his more familiar emphasis on careful crafting. Pictures of throws invariably include Goldsworthy, rather than, say, show- ing sticks silhouetted alone against sky. The hand of the artist is shown releasing the work. An exception here are his recent Scaur streamworks; in these splashes and stream drawings, Goldsworthy's hand retreats as the work produces itself. A sense of experiment and deliberation is held to raise these erratic works above the shock tactic: 'There is a shock in seeing a river rock pool turned red by the rub- bing of two stones together. If to shock were my sole purpose, then it would not have mattered how the colour had been made. It is important to me that beyond this ini- tial shock is the truth that it is a colour of the river . . .,78 Erraticism is not arbitrary, and is to intrigue rather than repulse or confuse. This is a friendly avant gardism, not without humour, but it is the wise and wondrous humour of the fool rather than the con-artist's trickery. Goldsworthy offers erratic foolish 'truth' rather than magician's illusion, insisting on his distinction from a more frivolous gestural art. Work and artist may be erratic, but they are serious and genuine, with the photographs to prove it. Fame Goldsworthy becomes famous; his photographs economically as well as aesthetically liquid, his permanent works places to visit. International fame and fortune begins to generate contradictions in the local, and may demand a revision of the homed-in localism which has surrounded his work. It would be wrong to see the travelling Goldsworthy as global rather than local. Returning to the same sites around the world, he builds up a portfolio of places. The proliferation of bases to touch may, however, begin to strain his desire to elevate Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="22">444 David Matless and George Revill Penpont as the bedrock home. The map of his art redraws itself, no longer a chart of flights from the centre and back but a mesh around the world; Penpont less the cen- tre of a web than an especially strong knot. While Goldsworthy' s work emerges from local points around the globe, it circu- lates through a metropolitan global art market, its buyers perhaps attracted precisely by its non-metropolitan content. In exhibitions and linked books, he packages his local art in sophisticated fashion for metropolitan sale; indeed, his work of the past few years has been made very much with the book Stone in mind.79 His working method, though, asserts a different global-local circuit, beyond the metropolis. His earlier provinciality within Britain - ordinary northern man working ordinary north- ern places - is transposed to a global scale. Goldsworthy provincially works the regions of the world. Back in Britain, however, provinciality and fame may combine to undercut local humility. While he welcomes a popularity beyond a narrow art audience, and a place on school curricula, a popular place-based art can be double-edged. If art, artist, and locality are so bound up, then what better way to understand Goldsworthy than to visit his places? The permanent works can become destinations, making a circuit in north Britain, with Penpont the ever less humble heart of things. Given the British propensity for associating artist and landscape - Hardy country, Bronte country, Scott country - Penpont could be marked, counter to Goldsworthy' s philosophy, as Goldsworthy's place. In a nightmare future of popular success, the traveller approaching Penpont sees the sign: 'You are now entering Goldsworthy country. Please respect the environment. Leave no litter.
