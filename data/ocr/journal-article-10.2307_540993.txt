<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS around the manipulations of anthropomorphic gods. "Myth" is consequently an obsolete and ethnocentric translation for a whole panoply of culture-specific forms. "Myth" is quite simply "descriptively inadequate" to any deep understanding of American Indian traditional texts and deserves to be purged from our American scholarly lexicon. Finally, if Hymes would in the future annotate his prodigious linguistic analyses with avail- able ethnographic and ethnohistoric data on Northwest Coast peoples, his work would be con- siderably more powerful and speak to a much wider scholarly audience. As it is, there is so much effort expended on texts for their own sake that we are seldom invited to make connec- tions between these texts and their performances on the one hand, and (borrowing a phrase from Foxfire) "the further affairs of plain living" from which they sprouted, on the other. An- ticipating such criticism, Hymes defends himself in the "Introduction" for not attempting to be all things to all people, but we might ask that in the future he try to speak as often to fellow folklorists and ethnographers as he does to his own lost tribe of Lower Chinook philologists. We still have much to learn about ethnopoetics, and Hymes is one of the few who can truly teach us, but it's doubtful that we will become much wiser or more sensitive to the coding of texts until he starts grounding them in the real world. In his own words, "the material re- quires some understanding of a way of life" (p. 5). The "Ethnological Note" that prefaces the book, while terribly brief, is at least a gesture in that direction.

By Gary Urton. (Austin: Uni- versity of Texas Press, 1981. Pp. xx + 248, foreword, preface, introduction, maps, figures, tables, appendix, notes, bibliography, index. $30.00) Ethnoastronomy focuses on the astronomical understandings and techniques of traditional cultures in both the past and the present. It is concerned, on the one hand, with people's con- ceptions of the cosmos and with the many ways in which they integrate these conceptions into facets of their lives and, on the other hand, with the various means they develop to record, predict, and thus, in a sense, control these important phenomena. Both of the above-listed books may be described as breakthroughs in ethnoastronomical and even ethnographical studies, for their authors view astronomical knowledge and practices as in- tegral parts of the way in which traditional peoples conceptually organize the world around them. In both groups, astronomical events provide the template for ordering the universe- binding together the mythology, folklore, and material culture. The authors look, therefore, for clues to the shape of this astronomical knowledge both in oral tradition and in its interrela- tionship with information embedded in items of material culture. A striking similarity of both books is their delineation of the way in which these divergent peoples incorporate principles of astronomy and cosmology into every aspect of their lives, for both the Skidi Pawnee and the Quechua-speaking occupants of Misminay perceive the celestial and terrestrial spheres to be patterned after one another. The arrangement of Pawnee villages mirrors the groupings of important stars in the sky, while the intersecting footpaths and 483</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS canals of Misminay reflect the intersecting axes of the Milky Way. For both groups the impor- tant orienting directions are the intercardinals that point to the solstice positions of the sun. Both authors treat in depth the symbolic associations that develop in these cultural groups, for whom perceptions of cyclical astronomical events provide the central theme of existence. In When Stars Came Dou,n to Earth, Chamberlain carefully paints a picture of the Skidi Pawnee of Nebraska and Kansas-a people whose world, in both day-to-day existence and sacred rituals, centered on the stars, from which they believed all human and animal life had come. The chapter titles suggest the context of a play, revealing the extent to which Chamber- lain views as a brilliant performance the interaction of earth and heavens in the experience of this Native American group. According to the author, an understanding of the part astronomy plays provides "one methodological perspective that can be used to try to recreate some of the intellectual motivations and operations underlying the Skidi existence" (p. 207). And indeed, the role of astronomy is extensive, for it appears as an organizing principle for all other aspects of Skidi life-political hierarchy, village layout, agricultural practices, socioreligious activities, and the embellishment of material culture. Thus the stars are mapped onto all areas of the early domain in what Chamberlain calls a "complex star theology." This mapping in turn gives rise to an intricate system of symbolic associations, explored throughout the book, for the Skidi perceive one-to-one relationships between important stars, intercardinal directions, colors, animals, and village patterns. The earth lodge is a prime example of the incorporation of such associations, for "there is no part of it that is not symbolic" (p. 155); at the same time, the lodge functions on another level as a shelter and an observatory. Chamberlain also discusses the Skidi Pawnee sky chart painted on leather, a "symbolic work of art" that was "of great spiritual meaning to a vanished priesthood" (p. 205). The author includes part of a text recorded in 1902 from a Pawnee man who spoke directly of the star chart; significantly, this text contains the following phrases, which emphasize the connection between Skidi folklore, mythology, and cosmology: Groups of stars were to be standing here and there. They were made by him who gave the stories ... The stars, or at least some of them, are men who died of old age. All stars have stories and old men used to gather and tell these stories. [p. 202] Chamberlain concludes that this text not only describes how the chart was made but also points to its use over the generations: "to recall and pass on ideas about the important Skidi deities and their relationships to one another" (p. 202). This book is of importance to readers from a large number of fields, and the ideas in it are quite accessible, even to those without a formal background in astronomy. The author, a pro- fessional astronomer at the Smithsonian Institution who has long been interested in Native American anthropology and astronomy, has compiled this ethnohistorical work from pub- lished and unpublished ethnographic data, including accounts of Pawnee myths and ceremonies. Because of his background, Chamberlain is able to make reasonable identifications of many of the stars, planets, and constellations mentioned in these records. The appendix in- cludes a glossary of Pawnee terms referred to throughout the text, as well as charts and other material abstracted from ethnographic records to supplement the main text. The book is beautifully illustrated with drawings by contemporary Pawnee artists, ethnographic photo- graphs, and the author's own photographs of night sky phenomena. Urton's At the Crossroads of the Earth and Sky is an in-depth treatment of the cosmology of the Quechua-speaking villagers of Misminay in Peru and is based on his several years of field- work. Although this study is unique as the first to describe and analyze the astronomical system of a contemporary community in the Americas, the author also uses ethnohistorical 484</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS data to relate these present-day astronomical practices to those of the community's Inca predecessors. Urton's skillful treatment of this cosmology gradually unfolds into a complex picture of in- terrelated domains that is breathtaking in its detail. The terrestrial and celestial spheres are such clear reflections of one another that every object in one has a counterpart in the other. Perpen- dicular footpaths, paralleled by irrigation canals, divide the village of Misminay into four quarters, oriented toward the intercardinal directions, with the cross-containing chapel in the center. So too is the celestial sphere divided by the alternation throughout the year of the two axes of the Milky Way passing through its zenith, the central point of which is also termed "a cross." Significantly, the Milky Way itself is viewed as the extension in the heavens of the Vilcanota River that runs through the village, thus underscoring the importance of water as a mediating principle between sky and earth. This correlation is further elaborated with the ap- pearance in the sky of animal (dark cloud) constellations that behave in a way which cor- responds to the biological behavior of their species on earth, particularly in regard to mating cycles. These relationships are summarized by an old man from Misminay, who responds to Urton's questions about the sky and stars by asking whether he has come to understand the land and the community yet. The implication is clear: in Misminay "one cannot understand the sky without first understanding the earth" (p. 37). The activities of the villagers themselves, especially in regard to agriculture, are also integral to this correlation of cycles, particularly in the male/female division of labor, of space, and of time. Even the astronomical phenomena are classified as male and female; thus the sun and stars are male, the moon female. Urton's book begins with an excellent ethnographic and calendrical description of Misminay, followed by a discussion of the organization and structure of space according to cosmological principles. Astronomical phenomena treated in detail are the sun, the moon, meteorological lore, the stars, and the planets. The appendix contains a chart listing stellar con- stellations reported by other Cuzco-area ethnographers. Although trained as an anthropol- ogist, the author demonstrates facility with sophisticated astronomical concepts, which he is able to phrase in terms intelligible to readers from a wide variety of backgrounds. Throughout the text Urton's clearly expressed ideas are illustrated by diagrams, many of which relate this indigenous system of astronomy to Western astronomy and cosmology. University of Texas M. JANE YOUNG A ustin Afro-American Folklore Black English and the Mass Media. By Walter M. Brasch. (Amherst: University of Massachu- setts Press, 1981. Pp. xxix + 345, acknowledgments, introduction, appendix, notes, selected list of works cited, index. $25.00) Brasch claims to have discovered five cycles of media concern with Black English in the United States, each of them lasting "between twenty-five and forty years," and each "fol- lowed by an intercycle lasting between ten and twenty years. The lone exception was the Civil War intercycle of about seven years, the explanation being that war, at any moment in history, changes and accelerates the processes of society." (Brasch doesn't explain why he ex- cludes from social process the business of war, nor does he explain why none of these accelera- tions followed the War of 1812, World War II, the Korean War, or the Indochina war.) The cycles have been identified, Brasch says, by a systematic examination of publications in 485</page></plain_text>
