IN THE WALTERS COLLECTION BY GEORG SWARZENSKI Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Whoever feels attracted by the early eglo mis? panels will be puzzled by two facts easily perceived but hard to explain: the sudden spon taneous appearance of that art in the last third of the Ducento and the increase of the production in quality and quantity during the fourteenth century in Italy. Its abrupt appearance at this time is particularly surprising since the tech nique reminds one so strongly of late Roman and Early Christian gold- glass that one must suppose the tradition to have continued somewhere. The tenth-century writer, Theophilus Presbyter, speaks of it in his Schedula Diversarum Artium ( an entirely literary book) and the technique was known in Islamic art; but in the west from the whole period extending from 400 a. d. to the thirteenth century (1267) nothing of this kind remains?not a single object or fragment, or at least none has been found thus far. It will not be out of place to include here a brief description of the technique of Trecento verre eglomis?. Behind a transparent glass plaque is pasted a very thin gold leaf. On this the draw ing is incised with a fine needle which produces lines of clear glass. Finally, the back is painted. A single color, generally black or dark blue, pre vails so that the scratched-out drawing appears in contrast to the glimmering gold or viceversa. The modelling is rendered, as in the early draw ings or paintings, by hatchings only. This splendid effect is sometimes delicately enriched by a few colors?red and green. * Still more remarkable than the suddenness of its first appearance is the development and dif fusion of eglomis? technique in Italy during the Trecento as an extensive production of exceed ingly high quality and popularity. There are only a few isolated pieces of earlier date,1 but in the Giottesque period and later a large produc tion in Italy is evident. It is true that the objects preserved total only about sixty pieces, includ ing those made during the following century in the same technique and in an unbroken tradition. This number represents but a small part of the original production. Considering the fragility and?in comparison with fine metalwork and * The word "eglomis?" as a historical or technical expression is rather arbitrary.

The correct expression? gold-leaf drawing or engraving behind glass?is too cumbersome, and such terms as "gold glass" or "painting behind glass" are misleading. The term "eglomis?" has been used for at least a period of one hundred years and is derived from the name of a craftsman called Glomy, who lived in Paris in the second half of the eighteenth century. One of his many activities was con cerned with the revival of an analogous or even identical tech nique, which became the fashion in almost every country. 11, e.: Brussels (Mus.

While northern Europe has given us a very few rare examples, the art of eglomis? undoubtedly became a specifically Italian craft in the Trecento. Although the basic technique and even the general character of the objects is very nearly the same in all Italian eglomis? plaques of that per iod, they must have originated in several centers. The character of the drawing reveals a consider able variety of style and indicates that the mak ing of verre eglomis? became naturalized in differ ent schools, places, and regions of northern and central Italy. There are single works and groups of works pointing to the leading centers and also to provincial ateliers. Furthermore, not only does the style vary, but the quality of the draw ing is very unequal. Some eglomis? plaques, rivalling in quality the best of the rare Trecento drawings, even deserve attribution to well known painters, others are obviously mediocre wholesale productions made in workshops for commercial purposes. Among the treasures in the Walters Art Gal lery are two fine examples of Trecento eglomis?. One of them, a reliquary tabernacle,2 has in ad dition to its artistic merit an almost unique im portance (figs. 1,4). Its origin is not recorded, but it is one of the very few objects of this kind whose connection with a certain school and known artistic personalities can be established. Strangely enough, there are no documents what ever relating to the manufacture of eglomis? ob jects at any place or region in Italy, and among all extant Trecento examples, not a single one bears a statement concerning its origin. The first dated eglomis? work is as late as 1408; the first ones with an artist's signature belong to the advanced Quattrocento (1460). Thus only by stylistic comparison with other arts is it possi ble to localize and date Trecento eglomis? plaques, although everyone knows how mislead ing is the rapid spread of the so-called Giottes que style through all Italy. The reliquary in the Walters Gallery goes far toward compensating for the lack of documents and inscriptions, since it is one of the two known objects showing eglomis? plaques combined with tempera panel painting attributable to known artists. Fortunately, each object happens to point to a different locality, both of which ought to be recognized as centers of eglomis? production. The reliquary tabernacle in the Walters Art Gallery is a starting point for the localization of the craft in northern Italy. The other in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin is signed by the Sienese painter, Francesco di Vanucci, and dated 137- (the last figure is destroyed). As Francesco di Vanucci's painting in Berlin3 (figs. 2-3) has been well known for many years, only certain general considerations need be noted here. It is a two-sided processional pic ture; on one side the "Crucifixion" is painted as usual in tempera, on the other side, in eglomis? is the "Madonna," both with assistant figures. The signature is to be found on one side only? on the tempera picture, but in spite of the differ ence of material and technique, both paintings were made or, at least, designed by the same hand. We are thus enabled to conclude that eglomis? pictures were at times executed by panel painters. This conclusion is supported by Cennino Cennini, whose Treatise is the best contemporary source not only for the making of eglomis? objects, but also for the many diverse 2 No. 37.1686; acquired 1902; 17% in.

THE LOCALIZATION OF MEDIEVAL VERRE EGLOMIS? activities in a medieval painter's studio.4 Fur thermore , Francesco di Vanucci ' s processional pic ture proves that the art of eglomis? work was practised in Siena. No one knows, however, why in old collections?long before the dis covery of this picture?eglomis? objects were labelled with an obstinate predilection as "Sienese." In reality this is the only documented Sienese piece, and it does not seem possible to localize a considerable group of eglomis? panels definitely in Siena. The Walters tabernacle also gives substantial enlightenment, although, as a whole, it poses some puzzling questions. It is a reliquary in the shape of a small Gothic altar-piece carved in gilt wood. Here the tempera paintings (cf. Mme. Sandberg-Vaval?'s article which follows on page 69) are found in the qua trefoils and in the arches of the framework and the top, while the central feature is a large eglomis? plaque5 form ing the cover and adornment of the enclosed relics (fig. 4). A second smaller eglomis? panel6 in the uppermost arch at the top represents the single figure of the Virgin Mary in the attitude of the ' 'Annunciation' '?without the angel. Thus it appears that the present object once had a pendant. There is, indeed, a rather numerous group of eglomis? reliquary diptychs showing on one wing the ''Crucifixion" and on the other the "Nativity," both surrounded by busts of saints, and at the top of the wings, Mary and the angel of the "Annunciation." The Walters Gallery also possesses another eglomis? reliquary that is a typical example of this kind, which we shall discuss later (fig. 8). Unlike Francesco di Vanucci's processional picture, the Walters tabernacle is not signed and its original provenance is unknown, but the character of the whole object is north Italian. The carved frame alone, with its rather heavy details, suffices to show an origin north of the Apennines, and the paintings are attributed in an accompanying article by Mme. Sandberg Vaval? to Tomaso da Modena, one of the best artists in this region. The eglomis? panels are not by the same hand as the paintings. This statement cannot be supported by any precise facts of technique or quality. Even though the small busts of the saints which alternate with the written labels of the relics, are subordinated and rather carelessly done, the "Crucifixion" in the center is excellent. Its draftsmanship is masterly, the expressive movements of the Vir gin7 and of St. John8 are very unusual. Never theless, the style and manner of the eglomis? sec tions are rather different from that of the tem pera paintings and indicate the individuality of another master. Therefore, caution is necessary in interpreting the relationship between the eglomis? and paint ed sections. It is possible that the former were made by an artist associated with the painter, working in the same place or even in the same atelier. But, theoretically and technically, it is not impossible that the eglomis? elements came from another locality to be incorporated into this tabernacle. Without doubt, eglomis? ob jects were made in many places and exported; on the other hand, the local styles in northern Italy are not so individualized as the Florentine or Sienese?Tomaso da Modena himself was active in places as remote from each other as Modena and Treviso, and even Prague. Without reference to attribution, the general style of the painting would be not at all out of place in 4 Cennino d'Andr?a Cennini, // libro dell'arte, ed. Daniel V.

THE JOURNAL OF THE WALTERS ART GALLERY . Bologna. However, in this case the eglomis? sections were, ab origine, part of the object and there is no reason to doubt their north Italian origin. Wherever the plaques may have been made, both artists were contemporary and be longed to this region, where the various schools were intimately connected. There are indeed some other eglomis? ex amples attributed or attributable to northern Italy. They are not as frequent as those from other regions (see below) and cannot be placed in a definite group or be localized in one place. I do not know any two which can or should be ascribed to the same hand, but they are all con nected with each other and with the Walters reliquary by certain links in style and by icon ographical formulae. The north Italian origin of some eglomis? ob jects has already been claimed by Pietro Toesca, who first drew critical attention to these things.9 One of the most significant examples is a "Crucifixion" in the Victoria and Albert Mu seum (fig. 5).10 The whole arrangement of this masterpiece corresponds closely to the Walters reliquary; if one reconstructs the missing lower border on the eglomis? panel in London and cuts off the carved crest of the tabernacle in Balti more, the analogy between the objects is strik ing. The style of the drawing in the two also re veals relationships; the unusual movement of the Virgin in the Walters Gallery and of the St. John in London, and the faces of both figures show a more than casual likeness. The eglomis? plaque in London is attributed to a Bolognese artist, and was thought by Toesca to be of the school of Nicolo.11 However, the rare attitude of St. John?the arms and open hands expressively stretched downward?and the less significant flying angels are almost exactly the same in a Romagnole fresco of the Rimini school,12 a re semblance that illustrates the difficulties of locali zation, rather than necessarily refuting Toesca's attribution. The Walters plaque also is related to another example of typically north Italian character: an eglomis? diptych in Turin.13 Again the artist is certainly connected with the school of Bologna, although his relation to the Bologn ese painter, Jacopo Avanzi, should not be exag gerated.14 In the Walters eglomis? plaque the busts of the saints in the border especially recall the style of the Turin diptych, but the drawing of the "Crucifixion," distinguished by its fluent, expressive character, is comparable to the only signed panel-painting by Avanzi in the Galleria Colonna.l? Finally, a third and hitherto unknown eglomis? panel in the Thyssen collection in Lugano shows a relation to the "Crucifixion" in the Walters Gallery (fig. 6). Its original provenance is unknown, but its membership in this apparently widespread family is unquestion able. In spite of the individual features of the drawing, not only is the obvious similarity of the attitude of St. John remarkable, but also the drapery of the Virgin reveals characteristic el ements of the same school or tradition. The loose but recognizable connection be tween these three verres eglomises and that in the Walters collection might be supported by a glance at the few other eglomis? plaques at tributable to northern Italy.

The whole object, being part of a dip tych10 in a carved frame with relics, represents a liturgical type similar to the Walters reli quary. Although it was executed by a very dif ferent hand, its advanced and agitated style is to be traced to Nicolo da Bologna and his school, while the rare anthropomorphic representation of the apocalyptic beasts on the upper edges re calls a picture of Barnaba da Modena in London.17 Another hand again appears m a little taber nacle altarpiece in the Victoria and Albert Mu seum (no. 102.82) and again its northern, or more precisely, northeastern character is ob vious as much in the framework as in the main representation, the "Crucifixion" with many people.18 The subject is a favorite one in this re gion. As distinct from the Bologna plaque men tioned before, the composition and single icon ographie motives correspond particularly to fresco paintings in Verona. Finally, an interesting later piece in Lyons should not be omitted in this brief review of north Italian Trecento eglomis? production. It is one of the few existing examples showing the use of eglomis? glass in a large carved architec tonic reliquary tabernacle, and it is the only one which employs a standing single figure of a saint. Its style has little to do with that of any of the other pieces gathered here, but it also illus trates the complex inter-action of influences which characterized much production of this region: the Giottesque tradition has been modi fied, the general style is the result of the inter relations of artists of Bologna and Modena, with those further to the north in centers such as Verona, Padua, and Venice. And from both these regions a strong current streams to the Adriatic ?through the Romagna southward into the Marches. Difficult or even impossible as the exact localization of these eglomis? panels might be, there is abundant evidence that the craft was practiced in northern Italy. Apart from stylistic considerations, which have their pitfalls, there are many general indications which permit the localization of even outstanding works of this kind in this region. The part played by the glass-making centers of Venice and Murano should be rated highly, even though it is im possible to reconstruct it. And for all we know, the special knowledge and appreciation of verre eglomis? recorded by Cennino Cennini might well be the result of his activity in near by Padua. However, by far the greater part of all the eglomis? panels preserved originated in the dis trict south of the Apennines. Contrary to what might be expected, the great center here was not somewhere in Tuscany, such as Florence or Siena, but in Umbr?a. We are dependent on the objects remaining today since literary docu ments are wanting, but it cannot be entirely by chance that the very few eglomis? panels of more or less pure Tuscan style are single, isolated pieces, while among the many eglomis? plaques whose style is Umbrian or connected with Um br?a, a considerable number can be assembled into coherent groups. Some of these obviously were produced by very active ateliers and one may even distinguish particular hands. It is a fact that?with one exception, a diptych in Volterra, in the southernmost portion of Tus cany?all the early eglomis? objects which are still in their places of original ownership are to be found in this general region?Umbr?a and the adjoining area of Abruzzi: Assisi, Gubbio, Todi, Recanati?a further one was probably in Arcevia, and one is in Sulmona (Abruzzi).

The extent of the production may have been greater here than anywhere else. An examination of this hitherto little-known material would probably show that the share of the Marches in quantity at least was larger even than that of Umbria. However, it is difficult to be certain about many such localizations. Objects produced in Umbria show much influence from her northern neighbor, Tuscany. On the other hand, the contribution FIGURE 7 VIENNA, KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM HalfofDipych N?tivity which Umbria made to the region of the Marches, on her east, mingled there with stylistic cur rents coming along the Adriatic coast from the V?neto. Nevertheless, despite such confusing in terrelations, there are many eglomis? pictures so very definite in style that they can be assigned without hesitation to Umbria or central Italy. They are quite distinct from the north Italian products which have been discussed previously. Despite distinctions between the style of northern and central Italy, Filippo Rossi in the first attempt to reconstruct the importance of verre eglomis? in Umbria, attributed the Walters reliquary tabernacle to this region.19 As a matter of fact, the Umbrian objects which he assembled are only a portion of those still extant, and, moreover, he has included among them some more properly attributable to the Marches.20 But in any case, none of these groups can be connected convincingly with the Walters piece so as to indicate its localization in this region. The stylistic similarities which misled Rossi in placing the Walters reliquary are features which are due not only to the interplay of artis tic influences which we discussed above, but to the peculiar traits imposed by the craft itself, without relation to locality. Not only technical qualities, but the limitation of eglomis? decora tion to liturgical objects, entailing a preference for certain subjects and iconographical formulae21 resulted in characteristics common to ateliers both north and south of the Apennines. Apparently it was the combination of eglo 19 Un reliquiario con vetri dorati del Museo Nazionale in Firenze in D?dalo, IX (1928), 707. 20 The fine diptych in the Metropolitan Museum collection, no. 17.90.922, connected by Rossi, op. cit., p. 714, with the Walters tabernacle and included in his Umbrian group, repre sents a style very different from both. It belongs to a Marchigian atelier together with another example in the collection of Baron Goldschmidt-Rothschild in Frankfort. 21 The rare motive of St. Peter carrying a cross-staff (besides the keys) is to be found among the busts of saints on the Wal ters tabernacle as well as that of a leaf of a diptych in Vienna, referred to later. 64</page><page sequence="12">THE LOCALIZATION OF MEDIEVAL VERRE EGLOMIS? mis? elements with a reliquary that caused Rossi to attribute the Walters tabernacle to Umbria. But Cennino Cennini, describing the making of verre eglomis?, says directly it is "un membro di gran devozione fer adornamento d'orliquic santc," and the extant objects confirm the fact that this use of the material was not a specialty of one school or region alone. It is true that the particular ar rangement of the eglomis? panels and relics in the Walters reliquary may be found in many productions of the southern region, but at the same time, I see no reason why it should not have been known in northern Italy. Hence, Rossi's attribution of the Walters tabernacle to Umbria cannot be sustained. The most striking analogies of arrangement are not in the Umbrian, but in the Marchigian pro ductions. Of particular interest in this respect is a group of reliquary diptychs whose origin is not established, but which has to be sought in a district further removed from the centers and borders of Umbria, somewhere in the Marches.

The definite, and cer tainly provincial, dialect of these works shows some retarded archaistic features. These should not induce us to place the production too early; probably the actual date is about 1400.

In central Italy there are many holy shrines, and apparently one or more of these sanctuaries offered relics for sale to pilgrims in these attractive "packages." Wherever these diptychs were made, the pro ductions must be connected with the Order of St. Francis, since St. Francis and other Francis can saints occur in almost all existing eglomis? diptychs that include representations of saints. As works of art, the productions in this par ticular group are rather modest. The very distinctive style and the attractive icono graphie motives derive from Umbrian sources, and only the Volterra diptych presents in the Madonna a subject not repeated in the other examples. Apparently the activity of this atelier was entirely imitative and had no pr?tentions to originality. The sacred contents were more im portant than artistic merit. But this is no reason for disdain. The diffusion may have contributed to the increasing popularity of eglomis? objects in Italy and it may explain certain typical feat ures which occur even in the finest examples of other schools. After all, most painting and sculp ture of the early days is no more creative than these, but is to be considered also as the product of pious industry frankly imitating and modify ing the recognized older models.</page></plain_text>
