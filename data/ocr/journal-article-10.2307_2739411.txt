<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sublime Moments and Social Authority in Robinson Crusoe and A Journal of the Plague Year GARY HENTZI THE KINSHIP BETWEEN DEFOE S NOVELS and the aesthetic of the sublime is not an obscure one. Robinson Crusoe and A Journal of the Plague Year both testify to their author's fascination with the power of natural catastrophes, and Maximillian Novak has observed that in this respect they anticipate such popular examples of the sublime as Thomson's The Seasons and the theatrical spectacles of Philip James de Loutherbourg.' Yet the sublime is more than just a taste for cataclysmic events; indeed, its ambiguities are a major theme of eighteenth-century writers. And while Defoe showed little interest in the kind of aesthetic speculation that intrigued so many other major figures of his era, Robinson Crusoe and A Journal of the Plague Year exhibit some striking parallels with the reflections of his contemporaries, which underline the larger cultural significance of their ideas. More specifically, I will suggest that these two narra- tives reveal a social and political dimension of the sublime that has too often been ignored in recent discussions. Perhaps the most prominent characteristic of the sublime moments in Defoe's narratives is fear; however, if the association of fear with 1 See Maximillian Novak, "Imaginary Islands and Real Beasts: The Imaginative Genesis of Robinson Crusoe," Realism, Myth, and History in Defoe's Fiction (Lincoln: Univ. of Nebraska Press, 1983), pp. 27-46; and also his remarks on the sublime in Eighteenth-Century English Literature (New York: Schocken Books, 1983), pp. 54- 64. 419</page><page sequence="2">420 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES the sublime immediately calls to mind Burke's Enquiry, it must be remembered that Burke was not the first to see a relationship between the two. Most notably, in his unfinished 1704 treatise on The Grounds of Criticism in Poetry, John Dennis investigated the role of the "Enthusiastick Passions" in producing the experience of sublimity and assigned an important role to terror, which he described as "a Disturbance of mind proceeding from an Apprehension of an approaching Evil, threatning Destruction or very great Trouble ei- ther to us or ours."2 When this "disturbance" comes on suddenly, it is called terror; when gradually, fear. With typical straightfor- wardness, Dennis then goes on to observe that terror is inspired by things "that are powerful, and likely to hurt" (p. 356). The greater the terror, "the more it is joined with Wonder, and the nearer it comes to Astonishment," and thus to a feeling of the sublime. Ultimately, he asserts that the strongest feelings of sublimity are inspired by reli- gious ideas, for "what can produce a greater Terror, than the Idea of an angry God?" (p. 356). The sense of a link between fear and the sublime was in the air, then, well before Burke gave the theme its most influential treatment in the 1750s; and as Dennis's final remark suggests, its prominence is traceable to some of the same theological currents that shaped Defoe's mind. In a recent essay, Paul Fry has interpreted the idea of fear that plays so large a role in English theories of the sublime as a historical transformation of the literal fear of God and the Devil characteristic of anthropomorphic religion. "The word 'fear,"' he argues, "is released from its Aristotelian moorings in the history of criticism at just the point when theological fear gives way to spiritual anxiety ."I Like Robinson Crusoe itself, Dennis's account of sublime fear thus represents an attempt to negotiate the coexistence of reli- gious and secular tendencies in a period of profound cultural change.4 2 John Dennis, The Grounds of Criticism in Poetry, The Critical Works of John Dennis (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ.

I refer to the notion of "vast- ness," the sense of boundless extension that is typically produced by the sublime object. Versions of this concept occupy prominent places in all the major eighteenth-century accounts of the sublime, including those of Dennis, Addison, Baillie, Hume, and Burke; and it is linked to the theme of terror as early as 1677 by Saint-Evremond in his "A Discourse Upon the Word Vast."'5 Perhaps the most useful way to grasp the relationship between this basically empirical idea and its religious antecedents is, as Thomas Weiskel suggests, to view it as a displacement of traditional attributes of the divine, like immensity or infinity, onto the world of sensory experience and especially such natural phenomena as seem to approximate those qualities.6 Landscape in particular-the dizzying grandeur of mountains or great stretches of space-becomes a regular point of reference, and this interest in the dramatically uncontained or overwhelming aspects of nature constitutes a notable exception to the dominant aesthetic values of the period. Here we encounter a key paradox of the sublime. Though de- scended in part from religious tradition, it nevertheless reflects the movement of secularization that is the signature of Enlightenment thought. Yet while the dominance of such neoclassical ideals as unity and decorum is a complement of the growing belief in the power of secular reason, the sublime also represents an acknowledgment of the limits of rational control and the continuing presence of other, more ambiguous powers. As Samuel Monk has observed, from the late seventeenth century to the end of the eighteenth, the sublime "grew more and more into a catch-all for elements in art that the Cartesian aesthetic had suppressed or had not accounted for." Out- side of the "orderly garden of the Augustan age" lay a fearful but strangely enticing wilderness.7 S See Samuel H.

Indeed, certain later analyses of the sublime - those of Burke and Kant, above all - display their commitment to the dominant cultural values of the Enlightenment in the very terms with which they theorize seemingly non-rational phenomena. Consider, for example, the inclination of these authors to introduce that most abstract and rational form of description, quantification, into their discussions of the sublime by treating the idea of infinity in its strict mathematical sense. Thus, while Burke observes that "greatness of dimension is a powerful cause of the sublime" (a statement that, by the 1750s, was "too common to need any illustration"), he includes vastness of quantity as well as vastness of extension among those causes and assimilates it to the concept of the "artificial infinite" - the sense of boundlessness or indefiniteness of number in an object that is not literally infinite.8 Of course, the idea of quantity, as well as the self-conscious intention to incorporate the sublime into a rigorous system of thought, is given pride of place in Kant's later notion of the "mathematical sublime."9 As in the case of fear and terror, these tendencies derive from habits of mind that have a complex history. And here as elsewhere the uniqueness of Defoe's narratives lies in the extent to which they accommodate - however uneasily - a broad spectrum of intellectual motifs, shifting from one to another in an effort of negotiation that reflects the dynamic and heterogeneous character of eighteenth- century culture. For example, in the matter of quantification, Rob- inson Crusoe and A Journal of the Plague Year are exemplary En- lightenment texts: they count everything from stalks of rice to dead bodies and in the process underscore the relationship between the reflex of calculation and the interests of an expanding commercial class. Thus, even Crusoe's most offhand geographical measurements tend to be estimated with reference to his own position in the land- scape of the island, as when he notes that the stranded ship full of 8 Edmund Burke, A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful, ed.

Let us therefore examine one such passage, which is also one of the most famous moments in Robinson Crusoe: It happen'd one Day about Noon going towards my Boat, I was exceeding surpriz'd with the Print of a Man's naked Foot on the Shore, which was very plain to be seen in the Sand: I stood like one Thunder-struck, or as if I had seen an Apparition.... how it came thither, I knew not, nor could in the least imagine. But after innumerable fluttering Thoughts, like a Man perfectly confus'd and out of my self, I came Home to my Fortification, not feeling, as we say, the Ground I went on, but terrify'd to the last Degree, looking behind me at every two or three Steps, mistaking every Bush and Tree, and fancying every Stump at a Distance to be a man; nor is it possible to describe how many various Shapes affrighted Imagination represented Things to me in, how many wild Ideas were found every Moment in my Fancy, and what strange unaccountable Whimsies came into my Thoughts by the Way. (p. 121) This episode is, I believe, a notable precursor of what Weiskel has described as the "sublime of the signified," an instance in which the sublime object is not in itself vast but rather seems to echo with a multitude of resonances or implications that the mind cannot immedi- ately take in."1 The result is that the entire landscape is transformed from a state of benign, if empty, familiarity into a kind of sinister no-man's land, teeming with unseen threats. And while the chief emphasis of the passage is on Crusoe's terror, the other key word here is surely "innumerable," which refers not only to Crusoe's "fluttering thoughts" but also to the imagined "shapes" and "ideas" (here to be understood in the Lockean sense as mental impressions or images) 10 Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe, ed.

The effect of the experience is to leave Crusoe "perfectly confus'd and out of [him] self," just as his earlier attempt to circumnavigate the island had left him "hurry'd out of [his] Knowl- edge by the Currents" (p. 121) and alarmingly adrift on "the vast Ocean, where to be sure, there was no Shore, no main Land, or Island, for a thousand Leagues, at least" (p. 110). Along with the specific insights it affords into passages like this one, the sublime can also help to focus a more general historical analysis of the relationship between secular forms of representation and traditional religious habits of mind in Defoe's narratives. For the emergence of the sublime is not a simple linear progression, moving steadily onward from decade to decade. Rather, it is a multilayered history, which traces the elaboration of the concept alongside of the older religious experiences to which it bears a demonstrable relation; and a noteworthy feature of Robinson Crusoe is that it contains two separate and distinct moments of this history within the bounds of a single text. Early in the novel, when Crusoe is suffering from a violent illness, he has a dream that has long been recognized as the narrative's strongest link to the genre of spiritual autobiography, and is in fact its closest equivalent to a traditional conversion scene. 12 In this dream, Crusoe imagines himself sitting outside of his fortifica- tion, where he sees the figure of a man "descend from a great black Cloud, in a bright Flame of Fire, and light upon the Ground": He was all over as bright as a Flame, so that I could but just bear to look towards him; his Countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for Words to describe; when he stepp'd upon the Ground with his Feet, I thought the Earth trembl'd, just as it had done before in the Earthquake, and all the Air look'd, to my Apprehension, as if it had been fill'd with Flashes of Fire. He was no sooner landed upon the Earth, but he moved forward towards me, with a long Spear or Weapon in his Hand, to kill me; and when he came to a rising Ground, at some Distance, he spoke to me, or I heard a Voice so terrible, that it is impossible to express the Terror of it.... (p. 70) 12 See George S. Starr, Defoe and Spiritual Autobiography (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1965).</page><page sequence="7">SOCIAL AUTHORITY AND ROBINSON CRUSOE 425 This last phrase, along with his earlier remark that the angel's counte- nance was "impossible for Words to describe," is the most resonant in its foreshadowing of the terror and speechlessness that Crusoe later experiences when he comes upon the footprint. Moreover, his use of the earthquake as a point of comparison, reinforced by the observation that, in his dream, Crusoe was sitting "where [he] sat when the Storm blew after the Earthquake" (p. 70), underlines the continuity between the sublimity of nature and the violent, supernatu- ral figure with whom he is here concerned (the footprint passage offers a similar comparison, although it moves in the opposite direc- tion: Crusoe feels "as if [he] had seen an Apparition"). Yet the great difference between this sequence and the later one is that this is a familiar kind of generic episode, which details the narrator's encounter with an anthropomorphic figure, both terrible and divine, rather than a natural phenomenon - an experience to which Crusoe responds by repenting his sins and instructing himself in religious doctrine. Thus, the footprint episode can be understood as a transformation of the kind of scene represented in Crusoe's dream. For it is, in a sense, this angelic figure whose footprint Crusoe discovers in the sand: the footprint is the natural trace of a supernatural presence that has been dispersed and banished from the realm of practical affairs. Nevertheless, while in Crusoe's mind that presence still resides potentially in "every Bush and Tree," his ac- count of the experience departs decisively from the tradition of spiri- tual autobiography, omitting the otherworldly figure and instead presenting a moment of sublime astonishment, as he struggles with his "innumerable fluttering thoughts." It is true, of course, that the sublimity of the footprint becomes evident only in its effect on Crusoe; and there is little in this passage to suggest the attractive sense of "wonder" or "astonishment" (to use Dennis's terms) that plays so prominent a role in many accounts of the sublime. Such is not the case, however, with the second example that I would like to consider, this one taken from A Journal of the Plague Year; for although the great pit at Aldgate inspires an overwhelming feeling of dread in the narrator, he deliberately seeks it out with an interest so strong that it emboldens him to defy a "strict Order" forbidding entrance to the churchyard where it lies (p. 60). "A terrible Pit it was, and I could not resist my Curiosity to go and</page><page sequence="8">426 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES see it," the narrator remarks, thus directly linking the horrors with the paradoxical attractiveness of the spectacle. For this "dreadful Gulph" (p. 59), a sight that is "awful, and full of Terror" (p. 62), plainly exerts a kind of irrational fascination over him, from which he at first attempts to distance himself by giving a second-hand report of the pit's dimensions and the precise number of bodies thrown into it over the two-week period of its existence. Moreover, from a different perspective, he seeks to justify his curiosity on traditional religious grounds by suggesting to the sexton who guards the church- yard that the pit may be "an Instructing Sight," whereupon the sexton replies that it is indeed a "Speaking Sight" with "a Voice . . . and a loud one to call us all to Repentance" (p. 61), recalling Dennis's elevation of the idea of an angry God over all other sublime objects. Nevertheless, this orderly tally and humble affirmation of the pit's ability to communicate in the familiar language of religion are ulti- mately subordinate to the narrator's haunting evocation of the specta- cle itself, with its torches flickering in the darkness and naked bodies tumbling from the dead cart; and he finally confesses that the scene "almost overwhelm'd" him, so that, like Crusoe, he went away "full of the afflicting Thoughts, such as I cannot describe" (pp. 62-63). While in the vastness of its dimensions, the enormous number of bodies that it contains, and the curiously attractive terror that it inspires, the great pit at Aldgate possesses all of the features that eighteenth-century English writers attributed to the sublime object, there is a good deal more to be said about the narrator's response to this spectacle, which forms a crucial part of the experience. Dennis had argued that our feeling of terror in the presence of a sublime object is related to the instinct of self-preservation, and Burke would repeat this claim. Moreover, the latter's physiological account of how the sublime causes "an unnatural tension of the nerves," which differs only in degree from the state of a person in real danger, increases our sense that the experience involves a struggle of some kind.13 The most ingenious description of this struggle would not appear, however, until the end of the century, when Kant was to argue specifically that the sublime is an encounter in which the mind comes to master its own inadequate representations of the infinite. 13 Burke, A Philosophical Enquiry, pp. 38-39, 132.</page><page sequence="9">SOCIAL AUTHORITY AND ROBINSON CRUSOE 427 "The sublime is that," he writes in a famous passage, "the mere ability to think which shows a faculty of the mind surpassing every standard of sense."14 In the experience of the sublime, the mind "feels itself raised in its own judgment," since although it cannot perceive the sublime object as a totality, it is nevertheless able to form an idea of that totality and thus comes to recognize its own kinship with the supersensible laws of reason.15 Still, over seventy years and the cultural distance from England to Germany separate the Critique of Judgment from Defoe's novels, and the early history of the sublime suggests a more direct interpreta- tion of his narrators' responses to the experiences they have under- gone. If sublime fear is an offspring of the literal fear of God and the Devil, then Kant's even more sophisticated concept of "respect" for the law of reason can be understood as a further transformation of this same emotion, which could no longer be adequately described in religious terms. 16 From anthropomorphic religion to Kantian ide- alism, the history of the sublime thus reflects both the movement of secularization and a persistent, deeply ambiguous desire to master the threatening object in the name of some higher power. In the earlier part of the century, however, the theological language re- mains dominant; and the struggle that Kant was to explain as a recognition of our higher rational nature and devaluation of the world of the senses was more likely to be expressed as an allegiance to God and repudiation of the Devil. It is therefore a matter of some interest that the sublime moments in Robinson Crusoe and A Journal of the Plague Year are both followed by scenes of stern moral judgment, with the protagonists of Defoe's narratives taking it upon themselves to chastise the behav- ior of others. Thus, after leaving the churchyard, the narrator of A Journal of the Plague Year finds that he cannot stop thinking about a bereaved man whom he saw at the edge of the pit, and goes into a nearly tavern to inquire after him. "It is with Regret that I take Notice of this Tavern," he continues; for although the owners were "civil, mannerly, and an obliging Sort of Folks . . . there was a 14 Kant, Critique of Judgment, p. 89. 15 Kant, Critique of Judgment, p. 95. 16 "The feeling of our incapacity to attain to an idea which is a lawfor us is respect."

(p. 64). The narrator strongly reproves these libertines for their blasphemy; however, they merely ridicule him, and as a result of their temerity (or so the narrator implies), they soon fall ill and eventually are "every one of them carried into the great Pit . . ." (pp. 66-67). A passage like this suggests that the feeling of elevation character- istic of the sublime may have been closer to the "enthusiasm" of a true believer doing God's work than enlightened thinkers like Burke were willing to admit. Yet if Defoe thus presents the sublime as inducing an evangelical attitude, the episode as a whole displays considerable evidence of what Fry calls our "cultural ambivalence toward the patriarchal"; for "in the very vehemence with which the 'fear of God,' always the Hebrew God, persists, one can suspect the suppression of the Devil, who has been exiled from the polite world as a peasant bogey and whose force indeed continues unabated only in populist religions. 917 Like Freudian primal words, the imagination of a supreme being implies the presence of its opposite number; and the experience described by the narrator of A Journal of the Plague Year can be understood as a confrontation with just this sort of ambivalence, resulting in a powerful identification with God and rejection of the Devil, whose attributes are detached from the sublime object, projected onto a convenient scapegoat, and duly excoriated. Such ritual expulsion is above all a social gesture, an assertion of authority in relation to others; and the parallel sequence from Rob- inson Crusoe suggests that it can have a political resonance as well. Crusoe's initial assumption upon discovering the footprint is note- worthy in this context: he suspects that it is the work of the Devil and spends the better part of a page arguing himself out of this extravagant hypothesis. Yet having concluded that the print was probably made by savages, he discovers that his religious faith has been threatened no less than his physical well being, and only after preparing to defend himself is he able to regain his composure. Even this spate of activity does not set his mind entirely at ease, however; 17 Fry, "The Possession of the Sublime," p. 192.</page><page sequence="11">SOCIAL AUTHORITY AND ROBINSON CRUSOE 429 for "the Aversion which Nature gave me to these hellish Wretches, was such, that I was fearful of seeing them, as of seeing the Devil himself' (p. 130). He therefore considers several possible schemes to kill some of them, an idea that he abandons only when it occurs to him that the commission of such a bloody act might offend God. Still, for Crusoe, the cannibalism of the savages remains a "hellish Degeneracy" (p. 133); and his only consideration is whether its punishment ought rather to be administered by God, since "the Crimes they were guilty of towards one another . .. were National" and should be left "to the Justice of God, who is the Governour of Nations, and knows how by National Punishments to make a just Retribution for National Offences . . " (p. 135). As a nation, then, the savages are effectively demonized, even though they may be subject to conversion individually, as the case of Friday shows. And while Crusoe, in a gesture of humility, refrains from personally dispensing divine justice at this point, his scruples do not prevent him from launching just such a campaign later in the narrative, when he discovers that the savages are preparing to make a meal of a Christian (pp. 179-86). For Crusoe's recovery from his state of sublime confusion is, no less than the tavern scene in A Journal of the Plague Year, an assumption of social authority; and because this authority is exercised over an entire nation, his attitude takes on an imperial character that is highly suggestive in the context of the early eighteenth century, when the English had already eFtab- lished an empire in the Caribbean and North America and were trading regularly with parts of Africa and maritime Asia as well. Although it was not yet a widely held belief that England was destined to rule over large parts of the non-European world, attitudes like Crusoe's nevertheless played an important role in furthering that project. It may, of course, be objected that Crusoe's behavior is not simply an expression of arrogant self-interest or a desire to dominate, but is rather the necessary response to a genuinely threatening barbarism. After all, these savages do not seem inclined to discuss terms of peaceful coexistence. Yet even if we ignore Defoe's dubious inclina- tion to portray native peoples as fundamentally barbaric, there is still abundant evidence to suggest that Crusoe's acts are motivated by sentiments at least as "primitive" as anything he attributes to the</page><page sequence="12">430 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES savages. At this point, our analysis of the sublime moments in De- foe's novels and their attendant psychology intersects with a familiar strain of psychoanalytic and phenomenological criticism, which is relevant to the issue at hand. As early as Eric Berne's 1956 essay on the "psychological structure of space" in Robinson Crusoe, critics have noted how closely Crusoe's explorations and measurements are related to his sense of self, beginning with his fortification and eventually extending outward in concentric circles to include the whole of the island. 18 It is not difficult to recognize in these fantasy structures the workings of what Jacques Lacan has described as the "imaginary" register, with its binary logic of inside and outside, self and other, and more specifically that crucial early experience in the formation of human identity, the infant's discovery and exploration of its own physical capacities in the "mirror stage" of psychic devel- opment. Just as the young child finds in the image of its own body a stimulus to "the maturation of his power," as Lacan puts it, so the mastery of these unified physical spaces brings new confidence and security to Defoe's narrator; and in this sense an enclosure like Crusoe's makeshift fortress or, indeed, the island itself can be viewed as a figurative extension of the human body's organizing capacity. 19 The usefulness of this theoretical parallel becomes evident when we recall the point of Lacan's idea. Such body images are invaluable tools of psychic organization; however, they are also by nature provisional and fragile, caught up in a fluctuating movement of narcissistic gratification and threatened collapse, as when Crusoe sees himself alternatively as "my Majesty the Prince and Lord of the whole Island" (p. 116) and "a Prisoner lock'd up with the Eternal Bars and Bolts of the Ocean" (p. 89). His discovery of the savages is another such moment of violent despair, which finds characteristic 18 Eric Berne, "The Psychological Structure of Space With Some Remarks on Rob- inson Crusoe," Psychoanalytic Quarterly 25 (1956): 549-57. Other critics who have used conceptual models organized around the idea of the "self' to interpret Defoe's writing include John Richetti, Defoe's Narratives: Situations and Structures (London: Oxford Univ. Press, 1975); Everett Zimmerman, Defoe and the Novel (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1975); and Homer 0.

Norton &amp; Company, 1977), pp. 1-7.</page><page sequence="13">SOCIAL AUTHORITY AND ROBINSON CRUSOE 431 expression in the remark that he can no longer think of anything but how he might "destroy some of these Monsters" (p. 132). Lacan's term for this contrasting state of mind is aggressiveness, and he describes it as looking backward to the earliest period in the history of the child's development, when the world is experienced as a kind of decentered space, unmarked by any sense of self and other, but supremely heterogeneous in the matter that it contains -body parts, organs like the breast, and all of the other primary forms known as "part-objects." This archaic imagery is caught up in the fury of the aggressive state and provides the raw material for some of its most unsettling fantasies, which tend to feature prominently the class of images that Lacan calls "imagos of the fragmented body": "These are ... images of castration, mutilation, dismemberment, dislocation, evisceration, devouring, bursting open of the body...."20 From the perspective offered by these remarks, Crusoe's response to the appearance of the savages can be recognized as a significant psychological manifestation, which appears often in Defoe's writing. "Sometimes," Crusoe tells us, "I contrived to dig a Hole under the Place where they kindled their Fire, and put in five or six Pound of Gun-Powder, which when they kindled their Fire, would conse- quently take Fire, and blow up all that was near it . . . " (p. 132). This plan is quickly rejected, although it bears a striking resemblance to any number of other evocations of the "fragmented body" in De- foe's narratives that are in fact brought to violent fruition. In A Journal of the Plague Year, for example, we are told of a group of people who, desperate from being quarantined, "blow'd up a Watchman with Gun-powder" (p. 53). The logical culmination of this imagery occurs, however, not in any of Defoe's major works but in his journalism; for if Crusoe's island is a version of the fantasy of the body as a figure of ideal unity, then it follows that the corre- sponding fantasy of aggressiveness should involve the image of an exploding island, which is precisely what Defoe describes in a piece entitled "The Destruction of the Isle of St. Vincent," written just prior 20 See Lacan, "Aggressivity in Psychoanalysis," Ecrits, p. 11. I have followed Stuart Schneiderman's suggestion in rendering Lacan's aggressivite (as opposed to aggression-the distinction is between intention and action) as "aggressiveness," avoiding the awkwardness of "aggressivity."</page><page sequence="14">432 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES to Robinson Crusoe and closely related to such earlier journalistic exercises in the sublime as "The Storm" (1704). While "The Destruction of the Isle of St. Vincent" suggests a kinship between sublime imagery and the images of fragmented or exploding bodies in Defoe's work, an analogous episode from Cap- tain Singleton returns us inescapably to the question of colonial violence. Once again Defoe's narrator finds himself threatened by hostile savages, who so resent the presence of Europeans in their country that his men must "perfectly discover every Bush and every Tree" when they search for plunder, just as Crusoe suspects "every Bush and Tree" after he comes upon the footprint.21 Later, enraged to find himself "baulked by a few naked ignorant Fellows," Singleton uses gunpowder to vanquish his adversaries so thoroughly that some are left with "no Arms, some no Legs, some no Head" (p. 213), even though he is aware that this carnage achieves nothing other than his own "Satisfaction" (p. 214). Comparable but even more bizarre is the scene from The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe in which a righteous Crusoe blows up a heathen idol, offering yet another version of the same fantasy, this time under the pretext of evangelical Christianity (Crusoe argues that worship of this "Hobgoblin" has been "wrought up into hellish Devotion by the Devil himself').22 With their unmistakable signs of infantile aggressiveness, these epi- sodes reflect the extent to which the actions of Defoe's characters issue not so much from any justifiable allegiance to God or the laws of reason as from a regressive indulgence of the human potential for violence in the face of alterity. Thus, if the history of the sublime can help to focus certain issues in the study of Defoe's novels, these novels may also serve to illus- trate aspects of the sublime that have often gone unremarked in the many insightful discussions of the topic that have appeared over the last fifteen or twenty years. Until quite recently, the emphasis in this literature has not been on historical analysis along the lines of the 21 Daniel Defoe, Captain Singleton, ed. Shiv K. Kumar (New York: Oxford Univ.

For these episodes are not offered in the con- text of aesthetics, but rather present the sublime as an experience that can also take place in socially and politically charged situations. Viewed in this light, the feelings of aggressiveness and mastery that are such an important part of the narrator's response to the sublime object seem as potentially destructive as any other appetite for power and control; and in this context it may be useful to recall the emblem- atic significance attributed to one of those moments in the title of a recent book by Patrick Brantlinger, who sees the footprint in the sand as triggering the very desire to master other people and other cultures that much contemporary thought is seeking to expose.26 In contrast to the view of the sublime as a productively disruptive force, the example of Defoe's novels ought to call our attention to the politics of response to such moments of overwhelming distur- bance. It may be that the incommensurability of the sublime moment 23 Recent exceptions include Peter de Bolla's The Discourse of the Sublime (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1989), which draws fascinating parallels between writing on the sub- lime and the literature surrounding the National Debt, as well as the work of Jonathan Arac.

Either way, it is less helpful to generalize about the politics of the sublime than to examine individual cases in specific historical situations, and Defoe's novels offer just such a noteworthy instance. Appearing at the crossroads of secularization and the beginnings of English imperialism, they reflect some of the most expansive and liberating impulses in eighteenth-century English culture, and simultaneously link those impulses to the cul- ture's worst abuses. In the case of the sublime, Robinson Crusoe and A Journal of the Plague Year succeed in making visible the connections between an emerging area of aesthetic experience and the seemingly distant issue of social authority. Our task as readers is to ensure that those connections are not overlooked. Baruch College/CUNY</page></plain_text>
