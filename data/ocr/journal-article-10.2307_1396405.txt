<plain_text><page sequence="1">Barbara E. Galli ROSENZWEIG AND THE NAME FOR GOD* Am I a God at hand, says the Lord, and not a God afar off? Jeremiah 23:23 THE RELEVANCE OF THE QUESTION OF TRANSLATING THE NAME FOR GOD Of what relevance today is the question of translating the name for God? And, if relevant, can a pre-Holocaust thinker be a resource for answering it? The particular event of the Holocaust is claimed to be, by Emil Fackenheim and many others, a unique event, an historical rupture. Each of the events of the six million unique murder-deaths of Jews is and remains always as unique and as rupturing as the Holocaust event as a whole. The notions of uniqueness and rupture have led many thinkers to raise questions of meaning and meaning- lessness, and of how to proceed in philosophical and theological thought. We ask questions. And we do not understand. Our post- Holocaust philosophical and theological responses, in terms of gram- mar, comprise the interrogative. Where was God? Why was He silent? The pre-Holocaust philosopher, Franz Rosenzweig, in his philos- ophy of speech, does not develop the grammatical mood of the ques- tion. He nevertheless recognizes this mood in significant ways that can carry import for the postmodern thinker. Robert Gibbs sees in Rosenzweig's system, particularly with regard to his treatment of the concept of Revelation, a connection with current post-Holocaust struggles. In his excellent book, Correlations in Rosenzweig and Levinas,' Gibbs notes that Rosenzweig's analysis of the Song of Songs as the focal book of revelation concludes "with the issue of the publication (Veroffentlichung) of the miracle of love. This desire to publicize itself is expressed in the scream (Schrei), for the lovers' dialogue goes beyond itself, yearning for an opening up of the world for their love."2 Gibbs agrees with Rosenzweig in characterizing this scream as an open ques- *A paper based on one of the last articles Franz Rosenzweig wrote, in July 1929: "'Der Ewige': Mendelssohn and the Name for God" Modern Judaism 14 (1994): 63-86 ? 1994 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">Barbara E. Galli tion. Gibbs sees the scream as constituting a transition from revelation to redemption, expressed in the cohortative mood.3 "The scream is a cry for redemption, an open question to the redeemer-Why does God tarry?"4 Rosenzweig consistently connects the problem of the name for God with the problem of human suffering. Gibbs acutely observes that Rosenzweig's two questions, "God's Where are you? and the human's Where are You?, are not questions of essence but instead problems of existential or spatial experience. Gibbs suggests the development of a theology of the interrogative mood. The overarching grammatical mood in Rosenzweig's essay," 'Der Ewige': Mendelssohn und der Gottesname," is the imperative: we must bring into translation the Tetragrammaton. Again, with sensitive in- sight and clarity, Gibbs writes: "But between the question and the command there is a complex interchange, one which Rosenzweig no- tices but does not develop. The possibility for discovering theological insight in a postmodern world seems to lie here, in the intersection of the two moods of human speech."5 The following study of Rosenzweig's work on the name for God is undertaken with Gibbs' insights and suggestions always in mind. THE NEW THINKING AND THE NAME FOR GOD With Franz Rosenzweig's "new thinking" philosophy, the question of the name for God takes on non-traditional hues. For Rosenzweig, questions of divine revelation and of the divine nature are bound firmly together in interrelation and interdependence with the ques- tion of how to translate God's name from the biblical instances of it. Rosenzweig circumvents the philosophy of religion's three classical ways that attempt a naming or a describing of God: the via negativa, via positiva, and analogy. Rosenzweig, who sees himself as neither a theologian nor a philosopher of religion, but entirely as a philosopher who is also a believing Jew, gives full rein to the biblical word as informing authority. Rosenzweig enters into the question of the name for God from the viewpoint of the basic principles of his philosophy. He insists that three separate elements comprise reality, namely God, human, and world, each of which is equally transcendent to the other, and none of which can be reduced to any of the others. He maintains that truths are arrived at through the relating of these elements under the frame- work of creation, revelation and redemption. Rosenzweig therefore asks what God Himself, through his self-revelatory relationship with 64</page><page sequence="3">Rosenzweig and the Name for God human beings, tells of His name. Thus, the voice of God, God's self- revelation, may not be separated from an enquiry into God's name, and human logic alone is inadequate to initiate or to conclude the enquiry. Rosenzweig finds that philosophy is reluctant to admit its limits of knowing. It is unwilling to relinquish its claims that human logic can know all. To Rosenzweig, anthropocentrically angled questioning based primarily on logic may impose upon non-human elements in- correct characterizations. He battles against the prevailing reductionist theories that reduce everything back to the self. He thinks that these theories are distortive of reality. As a corrective to this distortion, Rosenzweig sets forth his principle of the three irreducible elements of God, man, and world. With this corrective, Rosenzweig makes the contingent claim regarding the irreducibility of the three elements' respective experiences. So entrenched and embroiled is philosophy in its reductionist attempts that Rosenzweig discovers his proposals for "new thinking" involve a battle for credibility. In his supplemen- tary essay to The Star of Redemption, "The New Thinking," he writes that "the pet idea of the [anthropological] modern era, the reducing everything back to 'the' self, this reduction or 'motivation' of the ex- periences of the world and God to the I that has these experiences, is so matter of course to scientific thinking even now, that anyone who does not believe this dogma but prefers to reduce his experience of the world to-the world, and his experiences of God to-God, is simply not taken seriously."6 Rosenzweig persists in emphasizing the importance of the sepa- rateness of the elements of God, man, and world in order further to clarify what he perceives to be the limits of anthropocentrically based modes of knowing. The separateness of [the three elements'] existence is presupposed here [in the "new thinking"], for if they were not separate, then they could do nothing to each other; if 'in the deepest core' the other were identical with myself, as Schopenhauer wants it, I could not love him, I should be loving only myself; if God were "in me," or "only my higher self," ... then this would be no more than an un- necessarily obscure formulation of an otherwise clear relationship, but above all, this God would hardly have anything to tell me other than what my higher self has to tell me, what I know anyhow.7 Apparently Rosenzweig kept up with contemporary Kantian schol- arship through a quarterly journal, where he found continued stren- uous efforts being made to reduce things to other things. He shows his impatient irritation with the persistence of the "old thinking": "... if I may trust my sacrificial perusal of Kantian studies every 65</page><page sequence="4">quarter, the ravens are still flying around the mountain (and regret- tably still find young finches who, notwithstanding their own beautiful beaks, try hard and, unfortunately successfully, to caw like them)."8 In conscious opposition to the Kantian critique, then, Rosenzweig holds that anthropocentrically angled questioning which is based on experience, that is experience of relationships, which in turn are de- pendent upon time, better opens the way to knowing about God than does reason which aims (and claims) to be timeless. Rosenzweig ob- serves that not only for everyday matters does the sequence of time play a part in knowing, but that "this is equally so of ultimate and lofty matters which one thinks one can know generally only timelessly. What God has done, what he does, what he will do, what has happened to the world, what will happen to it, what happens to man, what he will do-all this cannot be set loose from its tie to time."9 With regard to outside authority for knowing, which opens the otherwise closed bounds of human reason, Stephane Moses observes: As far as Rosenzweig is concerned, the delimitation of the field of knowledge could not be based on the autonomy of reason. Left to itself, reason would not agree to let itself be locked in the boundaries of experience. As Hegel's example shows, it would inevitably end up by claiming to "think the Absolute." On the contrary, it is the het- eronomy of thought, the submission of subjectivity to an outside authority, that makes possible defining the field opened to our ra- tional knowlege.'0 God's name, then, as revelation, will by no means be a mere humanly devised label attached to a datum, nor can it become a name associated with magical powers for coercing God. As revelation, the name will nevertheless say something about God. But that saying will demon- strate "the submission of subjectivity to an outside authority." The humanly spoken name for God, in its submissive saying, then conveys both something of the divine, and something about revelation to a listener of that saying. This limitation, this "something" of the divine and of revelation, means that the name by which we call God will be restricted to that which God reveals, but can contain, and convey, no less than that. Revelation brings to light the aspect of God that human experience is capable of containing; the remainder withdraws and can only remain concealed. In this sense Revelation does not negate the fi- niteness of human knowledge; on the contrary, it founds it. Its ab- solute Truth escapes man, it is not in spite of Revelation but because of it." Nothing may be added to-or removed from-the name as given. The point in the givenness of God's name is twofold. First, God gives 66 Barbara E. Galli</page><page sequence="5">Rosenzweig and the Name for God His name to us. By this He alleviates for us the onus of choosing, through any system of logic, one for Him. The onus of translating His name nevertheless remains. Secondly, the name for God is unique in that God alone named Himself at the same time that He gives His name to us. When we disclose our own names, we, to the contrary, give the name given to us by others than ourselves. If we do name ourselves, varying degrees of psychological disturbance are usually evident. In his reflection on a poem by Jehuda Halevi, "Gebet" ["Prayer"], Rosenzweig considers the problem of the giving and the givenness of names. In this consideration, he indicates as well as the chief error that is committed in attempts to translate the Tetragrammaton by means of logical processes. An attempt to arrive at a right name for God by applying scientific reason to the Tetragrammaton fails pre- cisely because reason is not the right tool for translating names or anything else of great importance. For translating the name for God, one key wanted is that which will turn the ear of the one being ad- dressed. Reason alone effects only the creation of a (false) name, and cannot convey the three essential contours of what is really to be translated. One of the essential contours of names is similar to a function of labels, that is to designate who is being referred to or spoken about. Names, unlike labels, have also the functions of invo- cation and evocation. One calls out another's name in the expectation that that other will respond. One also calls out in one's own name. But does God have a name? Are not all names here nothing but attempts to name the unnameable? Is one thus permitted to take any name, even if it is the name 'God' itself-for even this is a name, and today The Name-as seriously, that is, as being as real as the names that man has? This is a very serious question. But then does man "have" his name? Is it not also only given to him? And does he have it elsewhere than on the lips of those who give it to him? Does his name have a reality other than-to be named? IfJehuda Halevi and the Judaism of the millennia address God with the familiar name of this poem [Adonai] through which the mys- terious and ineffable shines, as is likewise quite clear in this poem, God is so called only when he is the living God and not a dead idol, really so as He is addressed. And when Shabbatai Zvi dares to force the arrival of the kingdom of heaven into this world by expressing the name according to its letters, his failure is shown plainly in this: that he can express only the vowels which do not at all have the meaning of giving the right pronunciation, and that thus the attempt to force ahead the end of Jewish world history fails for him exactly as for those today who try by saying the declared "scientific pro- nunciation" instead of God, to get again out of the circle of this Jewish world history, which has already encircled them.12 67</page><page sequence="6">Barbara E. Galli Stephane Moses interprets Rosenzweig's concern for the name in the Star at its farthest remove from any "scientific pronunciation" of it. Moses convincingly contends that Rosenzweig here relies on the Jew- ish mystical tradition. This reliance brings to light in Rosenzweig's system, according to Moses, its sharpest distinction from the idealist system. In the Star, God, as originator of creation and revelation, remains as always transcendent to the whole system. Thus, even be- yond the ultimate All of the Star's conclusion, God "designates a ho- rizon that is always pushed back, a hidden that by definition cannot be reached and that conceals itself always more deeply as it reveals itself."13 Moses holds that Rosenzweig connects these apparently paradox- ical divine movements to Jewish mysticism in its theory of the names for God. Moses perceives that Rosenzweig distinguishes three fun- damental aspects of the name precisely in accordance with Jewish mysticism. As will become evident, these three fundamental aspects, and especially the third, are the prime concerns of Rosenzweig's essay on Mendelssohn's translation. But, neither in the Star, nor in the essay in question, does Rosenzweig state indebtedness to Jewish mysticism for any of his argumentation. Whenever he makes reference to the Jewish mystical tradition, in the Star, in the notes to the Halevi poetry, or in the Mendelssohn essay, it is never with the thrust with which he refers to the Bible. The Bible is explicitly authority, in the Star notably Genesis and the Song of Songs. Notions from the Kabbalah are men- tioned from time to time as wise and true insights, but are never used as integral links in his philosophical expositions.14 The three fundamental aspects of God's name as theorized by Jewish mysticism which are clearly apparent in the Star according to Moses, are as follows: "First, Revelation is for him identical with the presence of the Name of God in the world. We do know that, in The Star, the order of Revelation is defined by speech and that within speech the proper name most clearly symbolizes the presence of the Revelation."'5 The human being recognizes, through being called by name in the experience of revelation, that he is an irreducible element of reality, and from that moment on: "The Name of God will then be conceived as the Name, the one from which all others are but emanations. Rosenzweig borrows here from [sic] his own philosophy one of the most fundamental ideas of the Kabbala according to which the Torah, the medium of Revelation, is nothing but a weave of divine names and that it really represents the Name of God itself, namely the Tetragrammaton."'6 It should perhaps be noted here that Rosen- zweig holds that the "problem of the name of God ... is only part of the logic of names in general.""7 He means this statement as illustrative 68</page><page sequence="7">Rosenzweig and the Name for God of the mutually helpful dependence between philosophy and theol- ogy, which he urges so strongly. That is, he maintains that each dis- cipline is aided when theological problems are translated into the human sphere, and when human problems are driven up to the the- ological. Thus, besides theories of Jewish mysticism, other factors are behind Rosenzweig's enquiry into the name for God. The second aspect of God's name that Moses discerns as being connected with Jewish mysticism in Rosenzweig's work is demon- strated in the move from Part I to Part II in the Star. Here Rosenzweig develops the Jewish mystics' notion that the transcendental essence of God, which remains hidden, needs to be differentiated from the name as revealed. In the Mendelssohn essay, as will be considered further below, Rosenzweig argues, with implicit reference to this sec- ond aspect, that the unity of the Bible depends on the demonstration of the connection between the name and revelation of the name. The third aspect of God's name which Moses sees Rosenzweig dealing with in the Star is indeed the prime focus of the essay on Mendelssohn, for this aspect relates directly to the task and imperative of translating the revealed name into speech. It is the aspect of ... the speakable Name, the one thatJewish tradition substitutes for the revealed Name considered unspeakable. For him, the apparently paradoxical nature of this prohibition, which pertains to the revealed Name, disappears when one understands that the prohibition aims at making man conscious of the fact that this Name is not a substitute, that it sends back, beyond the world of speech, to an unnamable essence. 18 Whether or not Rosenzweig is relying on the Jewish mystical tradition, he was certainly somewhat versed in it. Definitely, however, his de- pendence on the Bible, that is his acceptance of the authority of the biblical word, demonstrates a striking dissimilarity to previous West- ern philosophies which is also in keeping with the new thinking's, non- totalizing character. The philosophy of the new thinking operates under the principle of seeking and welcoming help from theology. Traditionally, theology's prime area of investigation, revelation, re- mained an area outside the interests of philosophy. Philosophy tended to shun or to swallow up the particular, be that particular an event or a human individual.19 The new thinking reverses the idealist move- ment of thought, and proceeds from the particular to the universal, in this case from the particularity of revelation to the universality of redemption. In an enquiry into the asking about the name for God, Rosenzweig sees both the Bible and the individual human heart as wholly appro- 69</page><page sequence="8">priate resources. The Bible, to Rosenzweig, is different from all other books. One comes to know all other books by reading them. The Bible is open to a second way. One can come to know what is written in the Bible in two ways; first, in hearing what it says, second, in listening to the beat of the human heart. ("Induction" is both.) The Bible and the heart say the same thing. That is why (and only why) the Bible is "Revelation."20 Thus, the name for God as revelation must be consonant both as it resonates in the human heart and as it is read in the biblical instances of the name. Although Rosenzweig wants, as a philosopher of the new thinking, to depend on the theological concept of revelation, the heart takes precedence in the area of ultimate truth claims. In the note to the poem "Hier bin ich" ["Here I am"] by Jehuda Halevi, Rosenzweig writes, with hints not only of the interrogative mood, but of an interrogational one: The human heart has the inalienable right to deny again and again the great truth of Revelation, that suffering is a gift from God, whenever it becomes a theological schematization, as it does again and again, and to reinstate against this the primeval position of nature. For this position suffering is suffering and nothing else. God answers only the word that rises out of the depth of all human powers, of the created as well as of the awakened.21 Rosenzweig clarifies here what he means by the heart's understanding of revelation: the distressed heart expects and demands God's helping and healing presence, and it expects an answer when it lays itself bare to God. God responds to a sincere call to Him, whether uttered from created (pagan) sensibilities, or from awakened. The Bible, as written, must correspond to the heart's understanding, or the heart's reception of revelation. The Bible, however, even if it constitutes a uniform expression of the name and revelation of the name, offers no description, no definition of God. More than anything else, it tells stories, it tells of events. Metaphors for God and apparent anthropomorphisms are plentiful, but a list of attributes is absent. Fruitful pointers for arriving at a satisfactory name would seem scarce here, but Rosenzweig finds something of great revelatory import in the so-called anthropomorph- isms: they tell of meetings between always the one and same God and human beings. In his article on biblical anthropomorphisms, written in 1928, Rosenzweig emphasizes that "the 'anthropomorphisms' of the Bible are throughout assertions about meetings between God and man. God is never described . . . never are two or more 'attributes' put in relation to each other, as is after all the basic principle of every 70 Barbara E. Galli</page><page sequence="9">Rosenzweig and the Name for God description...."22 In its desire for knowledge, however, the new thinking is less concerned with description and essence than it is with storytelling and time. And for a narrator, "time becomes... entirely real.... When for example the old thinking poses the problem of whether God is transcendent or immanent, the new tries to say how and when He turns from the distant to the near God and again from the near to the distant one."23 The name for God in the Bible consistently occurs under the suppressed form of the Hebrew characters of the Tetragrammaton, the Trigrammaton, or the Digrammaton. That is, God's name seems to be more concealed than revealed, or at least it protects itself well from would-be detectors of definitions.24 With which words, then, does one translate the biblical instances of God's name, and based on which criteria? How does one determine a translation of the name which is accurate to the extent that the philosophical and theological content derived from it echoes through to, and in, the voices that pick up that translation in liturgy, in private prayer, in references to God in the third person? MENDELSSOHN'S STRUGGLE IN DECIDING ON A TRANSLATION Rosenzweig holds Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786) in especially high esteem on two counts. The first is that, according to Rosenzweig, Mendelssohn was the first Bible translator to pose correctly the ques- tion concerning the translation of the name for God. The second count is that Mendelssohn's intended meaning of, and his reasons for the choice of the Eternal One as the name for God, are entirely correct. The choice itself, however, Rosenzweig argues, is wrong. Mendelssohn asks: How does one tie the rendering of the name to the revelation of the name? With this correct posing of the question, Mendelssohn concentrates on the one place in the Bible where the telling of God's name occurs through God's own speech, Exodus 3:14. Mendelssohn's choice of this verse as the deciding instance for his translation of the name for God is, to Rosenzweig, "in embryo Men- delssohn's entire merit concerning this problem and his decisive pro- gress beyond Calvin and the Reform Bible, and also his lead over the later Jewish translators who took from him this name for God."25 At Genesis 2:4, where the first instance of the Tetragrammaton occurs, Mendelssohn suspends comment, merely pointing in a note to Exodus 3:14, "for there is the place for it."26 The length and breadth of Mendelssohn's commentary demon- strate the depth of his struggle for the right expression. He is fully 71</page><page sequence="10">Barbara E. Galli aware that his choice of the Eternal One falls short of inclusively conveying the divine self-disclosure at Exodus 3:14. He is aware that he omits, with the expression of eternality, equally important disclo- sures, namely providence. Odd as it may seem to twentieth-century sensibilities, however, Mendelssohn believed that the meaning of providential would indeed be disclosed through the meaning of eter- nality of being. Rosenzweig juxtaposes in his essay his own and Men- delssohn's renderings of Exodus 3:14, followed by Mendelssohn's commentary: To the fourteenth verse of the third chapter of Exodus then, which in the original reads something like: But God spokes to Moses: I will be there [dasein] as I who will be there And said: Thus shall you speak to the sons of Israel: I AM THERE sends me to you and in Mendelssohn, broadly paraphrased, reads: God spoke to Moses: I am the being [Wesen] which is eternal. For he said: Thus shall you speak to the children of Israel; "The eternal Being, who calls Himself: I am eternal, sent me to you," Mendelssohn's commentary notes: In a Midrash one can read: "The Holy One, praised be He, said to Moses: Speak to them: 'I am He who was and now am the same one and I will be the same one in the future!' And furthermore our teachers say, may their memory be blessed: 'I will be with them in this need, I am the one who will be with them in the slavery under the rest of the kingdoms.' "-Their intention with this is the fol- lowing: 'Because past and future time are wholly present in the Creator, for with Him there is no "alteration or dependency,"27 and of His days there is no passing away, therefore in Him all times will be called with a single name, embracing past, present and future. Through these He points to the necessity of existence and points at the same time to the unbroken lasting providence. Thus He says with this name as it were: 'I am with the people: to be favourably inclined and to have mercy on whom I have mercy; speak then now to them, to Israel that I am the one who was, is and will be and exercise dominion and providence over the universe, I am the one and will be with them in all their need: will be with them in this need and will be with them at all times when they call to me.'" -But there is in German no single word that at once grasps the meaning of the all-the-time with the meaning of the necessity-of-existence and the meaning of providence, as this holy name ("the eternal necessary 72</page><page sequence="11">Rosenzweig and the Name for God pro-viding Being"28). Thus we have translated: 'the Eternal One' or 'the Eternal Being.'29 Onkelos30 translates: "I will be with whom I will be" (according to the version which Nachmanides produces), in the sense of "I am favourable to whom I am favourable and have mercy upon whom I have mercy" (below chapter 33). He intends to translate it from the viewpoint of providence alone, similar to the second Midrash. -The Gaon Saadia writes that the explanation is: the one who is not past and will not pass away because He is the First and the Last. His words are related then to the first Midrash, which points to eternity. Maimonides in the "Guide for the Perplexed" explains it: the existing one who has existence in Himself. So his intention aims at the meaning of necessity of existence. -The truth is that it em- braces all those meanings like this holy name. That is why each in his way interpreted according to one of those meanings. And the German translator decided to interpret it in the sense of eternity because the other meanings derive from it. Thus also in Jonathan ben Usiel I have found that he translates it in accordance with this meaning; I-who-I-am-and-will-be sent me to you.31 Exodus 3:14, with few words, is replete with categories of great phil- osophical and theological interest and import, notably those of time, eternity, presence, otherness, and revelatory utterance about divine- human relationships. There are clearly enormous stakes involved in the translation of this chapter, for the philosopher, for the theologian, for the "simple" believer. If, as to both Rosenzweig and Mendelssohn, the translation of the Tetgragrammaton should be informed by how one reads Exodus 3:14 and must embody the full thrust and content of the verse, then a choice of one aspect over others is hazardous. Not only may the other, equally important aspects be submerged, leaving the translation correct but incomplete, but the predominance of one aspect may result in a distortion of even that aspect itself. The concept of eternality, disassociated from time and event, for example, deters notions and perhaps possibilities of relationship between tem- porality and eternality. But, even if the predominant "characteristic" of God to be gleaned from Exodus 3:14 is eternality, then the pre- dominant action of God here is the promise of that eternality breaking into temporality. How does one join the two? How can the charac- teristic and the action mutually be displayed, so that each is equally prominent? The late Chief Rabbi of the British Empire, J. H. Hertz, in his commentary to Exodus 3:14, stresses the promise of divine action disclosed in the Tetragrammaton. Whereas the name discloses notions of self-existence and eternality, rendering it "a declaration of the unity and spirtuality of the Divine Nature, ... [it] is, however, not merely a philosophical phrase; the emphasis is on the active manifestation of 73</page><page sequence="12">Barbara E. Galli the Divine existence."32 On the traditional translation of the Tetra- grammaton into English as the Lord (Adonai), Hertz reiterates: "Here, too, the words must not be understood in the philosophical sense of mere 'being', but as active manifestation of the Divine exist- ence."33 Mendelssohn, with careful explicitness, states in his commentary that he holds equally valuable the two meanings which prevail in Exodus 3:14: the abstract philosophical concept of eternally necessary and the popular traditional view of providential. His aim and intention are therefore of course to find a word which would embrace both meanings. He believes he achieves this, because he has faith that the meaning of providential will be logically deduced from the explicit Eternal One. Rosenzweig observes: In the decision lies then a bit of that eighteenth-century faith, which we cannot follow anymore after the "destroyer of everything," which is just what Mendelssohn called Kant, that faith in the possibility of a "rational theology," for which-in flagrant contradiction to the philosophical-historical experience-the "provident being" would result with conclusive logic from the "necessarily existing being." Today we would, if at all, sooner agree to the reverse "conclusion" -from the one who cares to the one who exists. But for Mendels- sohn, the pre-Kantian man, it was in "the Eternal," or as he says in particularly important places as just here: "the eternal Being," that the God of praying appeal was meant as well and named as well.34 In terms of post-Kantian interpretation, then, Mendelssohn's choice is wrong. But Rosenzweig pushes the argument further as to why the Eternal One is a distortion of the divine speech. He agrees with Benno Jacob's conclusions about the third chapter of Exodus as a whole. To Rosenzweig, Jacob's treatise, "Moses at the Thorn Bush,"35 proves that the telling of the chapter speaks for the meaning of "providence" and against the meaning of "necessity of existence." When the text is considered even purely liguistically, the name for God revealed by God Himself "does not have the static sense of being but the dynamic one of becoming, entering, happening."36 Before God tells His name to Moses, Moses has been attempting to refuse the leadership which God commands him to assume. But God re-assures him, saying: "Yes, but I will be there with you." Moses then gives in and replies: Let it be then: I will come to the sons of Israel, I will say to them: The God of your fathers sent me to you. they will say to me: What is his name? What should I say to them?37 Rosenzweig penetratingly asks what sense at this point would a lecture on the necessity of God's being have on people in despair? "They 74</page><page sequence="13">Rosenzweig and the Name for God need, just like the fearful leader himself, an assurance of the Being- with-them of God; and they need it, in contrast to the leader, who has heard it from God's own mouth, in the form which attests the divine origin of the assurance, the form of the illumination of the old dark name."38 But can we, in post-Holocaust time, still accept the first claim at all, that is that God cares, from which we then deduce that he exists? Or does eighteenth-century faith once again make better sense, that is that if we can assert that he exists we can deduce that he cares? Neither direction of the logical deduction seems readily to make sense since the rupture of the Holocaust. Both God's caring and His exist- ence have been sharply questioned. Is it possible, or perhaps even important now, without denying the uniqueness or the rupture oc- casioned by the Holocaust, to retrieve worldviews pertaining to human suffering, from before the rupture, and to learn something from them? Does anything less than the notion of the continuity of God, or the concept of monotheism, depend on this? These are some of the difficult questions with which we struggle, and with these in mind, a careful study of Rosenzweig's choice for the name may help to lead, not to understanding it, but to futher possibilities for post-Holocaust responses. ROSENZWEIG'S CHOICE FOR THE TRANSLATION Only one translation is justifiable to Rosenzweig: the personal pro- noun. The personal pronoun possesses the capacity to express the three dimensions of addressing, being addressed, and being talked about. I (God) address; I address You (God); He (God) is being talked about. Only by means of the pronouns I, You, He, and their gram- matical cases, God can be shown to be by turns, speaker, the one spoken to, the one spoken about. The name for God is to be translated, is made transparent, through the pronoun. In his essay on Mendels- sohn, Rosenzweig refers to a letter he had written to Martin Goldner two years previously, in which he outlines how the disclosure in Ex- odus 3:14 of God's being-there-for-you and with-you, in the present and in the future is condensed to the rendering of the name in the personal pronoun. He writes: How can this now be translated? It would be quite wrong to replace the secondary adjective eternal by, for instance, a primary, e.g. pres- ent. Then still the most important point would be missing, the re- sonating "with you." And the one who is present would just be only a meaning not different from the Eternal One or the Lord and not, 75</page><page sequence="14">that which is the essential thing in the Tetragrammaton, a name which carries meaning. A name is alive only in the being called, the vocative is its sole casus rectus, the nominative is already casus ob- liquus.... The relationship, the two-sidedness, which is once in the name for God as a name generally and then especially through its meaning, must be rendered from the other end of the relationship, from the one who addresses and names, the being-present-to-you of the orig- inal through a being-present-to-me of the translation. And now there presents itself, as the vocative solution is obviously not possible as too grotesque, the personal pronoun, which after all in its three persons designates nothing other than the three dimensions of the being-present-to-me: the addressability, the audibililty, the discuss- ability. Whereby the second person is to be placed in front, for it is the source of the personhood of the two others: only the one whom I am ready to address, only he is considered as an I for me, only he whom I have once addressed, only he counts as a person for me, even in his absence; and on the other hand there comes to me only from the being-addressed my objective and subjective self-confi- dence, my He-and my I-consciousness, -not only in the psycholog- ical singular but in the sociological plural. Only because He is my You do I perceive the one who is present to me out of His I and may talk about Him.39 Everett Fox, in his remarkably fine achievement of translating Genesis and Exodus into English,40 carries forward the labors and legacy of Rosenzweig and Martin Buber, by following their principle that the Hebrew Bible is meant to be read aloud. While disagreeing with Buber and Rosenzweig in many places, Fox explicitly acknowledges an in- debtedness to them with regard both to their translation and the theory behind it, and particularly with regard to their work on the name for God in Exodus 3:14. Fox's agreement with the Buber-Ro- senzweig interpretation and translation of Exodus 3:14 is striking, however, because it is set against the contrasting background of his general disagreement with their translation of the name elsewhere. Fox not only finds them on shaky etymological ground with their decision to use the personal pronoun, but sensitively critiques their introduction of "an overly male emphasis through [the] constant use of 'HE,' an emphasis which is not quite so pronounced in the He- brew."41 Fox prefers YHWH, desirous of "leaving open the unsolved question of the pronunciation and meaning of God's name,"42 a pref- erence which of course diametrically opposes Rosenzweig's (and Bub- er's) specific aim to uncover the Tetragrammaton. On the decisive verse in question, however, Fox's commentary reads: God's answer is one of the most enigmatic and widely debated state- ments in the Hebrew Bible (the reader will want to consult Childs 76 Barbara E. Galli</page><page sequence="15">Rosenzweig and the Name for God 1974 for a full bibliography). What does ehyeh asher ehyeh mean? One's suspicions are aroused from the outset, for the answer is alliterative and hence already not easy to pin down; the poetics of the phrase indicate both importance and vagueness or mystery. There is some scholarly consensus that the name may mean "He who causes (things) to be" or perhaps "He who is." Buber and Rosenzweig, taking an entirely different tack (of which one ocasionally finds echoes in the scholarly literature), interpret the verb hayoh as signifying presence, "being-there," and hence see God's words as a real answer to the Israelites' imagined question-an assurance of his presence. The B- R interpretation has been retained here, out of a desire to follow them on at least this significant point of theology, and out of my feeling that it also fits the smaller context. For of the several times that Moshe tries to wriggle out of his mission God answers him all but once with the same verb, in the same meaning: "I will be-there with you".. .43 Thus, Mendelssohn, Rosenzweig, Hertz and Everett, while they differ as to how the name should be translated, all agree as to the meaning of Exodus 3:14. Still, to Rosenzweig, only one translation is justifiable: the personal pronoun, that which does not privilege the being eternal, "but rather the being present, the being there for-you and being there with-you and being there in the future."44 The privileging of the being-present by the pronoun nevertheless avoids obfuscation of the being-eternal. Unlike Fox, Rosenzweig wants a translation. He wants a translation which will distinguish the YHWH of creation from the YHWH of revelation. In response to Fox's charge that his translation is etymologically unsound, Rosenzweig might counter that his trans- lation by the personal pronoun, is according to his grammatical phi- losophy nevertheless linguistically correct, and does, according to his philosophy of translation, convey accurately the contours of the divine speech. The personal pronoun, while always meaning the same God, in its different persons is at the same time capable of linguistically showing relationships. Rosenzweig certainly prefers an attempt at translating or para- phrasing YHWH over no attempt at all. He again and again insists that, because Exodus 3:14 is God's self-revelation of His name, something must henceforth shine through that name when those to whom the name was given speak it. If one does aim at translating the name for God other than by transliterating the Hebrew characters to the vo- calized Yahweh or to the unvocalized YHWH, the dangers and pitfalls ultimately fall upon the recipients of the translation. To illustrate how important it is for the translator to bring to expression in translation that which he himself recognizes in the text, Rosenzweig reminds us of Philo, "the first of many who have used the great privilege of 77</page><page sequence="16">Barbara E. Galli humanity, to read the book of humanity in the servant's cloak of a translation as if it stood before them in the regal garment of the holy language. Philo gathered from his Septuagint only 'The Being One' is God Himself, the 'Lord' is only a subordinate divine power! and- naturally-the divine sternness, not the divine gentleness!"45 Rosenzweig's concern with regard to Mendelssohn's not bringing expression in translation that which he clearly recognized, then, is less a concern about Mendelssohn's error than about the impact it was having on the generations of German Jewry since Emancipation. Apart from Mendelssohn's style-shaping effect on German literature, Rosenzweig notes that ... the Mendelssohn translation had an effect only at one point on the German and the world Judaism: with its name for God "the Eternal One." It has not merely been taken over by most of the later Jewish Bible translations, but has penetrated also into the currently used prayer translations, into sermons and into everything else that is said in German in worship, and in connection with worship. In this way it has coloured Jewish piety everywhere in the age of Eman- cipation, even up to orthodox circles.... 46 Fox profoundly understands the recipient side of the translator's task, and a marked strength in his translator's reasoning lies just here. Not only does his commentary to Exodus 3:14 attest to divine providence, divine eternality, and an emphasis on being-there, but he carries through the notion of God's being-there for the individual reader of the Bible with the following reason. By using YHWH throughout, he is able to invite the reader to pronounce all instances of YHWH ac- cording to his or her custom, or to substitute one of the standard options: Adonai, Eternal One, Lord. Moreover, Fox suggests that those who are uncomfortable with the occasions where "he" is used should substitute "God."47 Thus Fox is not at all, on any principle, against the use of the various possible names by individuals in reading the Bible. Rosenzweig, however, works out of his philosophy of trans- lation, maintaining that there is only one language and hence that everything can and must be translated. He writes in his Nachwort [Afterword] to his Halevi translations that: "There is only one lan- guage.... Upon this actual oneness of all languages and upon the dependent commandment, namely that of universal human under- standing [or, accord: Verstindigung], is based on the possibility as well as the task of translating, its Can, May and Should."48 In the Star of Redemption he writes that "while there may be many languages, there is but one speech,"49 and that: The word as heard and as spoken is one and the same. The ways of God are different from the ways of man, but the word of God and 78</page><page sequence="17">Rosenzweig and the Name for God the word of man are the same. What man hears in his heart as his own human speech is the very word which comes out of God's mouth.50 Thus, to Rosenzweig, what God speaks can be translated, and he therefore examines closely these possibilities of translating the name and the ramifications of each. One wonders, if we did not have available to us Rosenzweig's reasons for the choice of the personal pronoun, would the illumination he seeks to show still shine through? The commentaries of Mendels- sohn, Rosenzweig and Fox all agree in the key feature of being-there; each commentary illuminates the respective choice. Does the Bible always require another text alongside it, Oral Torah? ROSENZWEIG S CONSIDERATION OF THE POSSIBLE NAMES The prime reason why Rosenzweig wants particularly a translation for the Tetragrammaton is that, to him, YHWH or Yahweh standing untranslated within another language, becomes like any other name. The Tetragrammaton ... is name and name of an attribute in one, -therein it is like all "names of gods: and yet separated from all of them in that with it, that which is namelike and that which is like an attribute completely coincide so that no part of the name remains unilluminated from the meaning...."They shall know that I am Yahweh," "Yahweh is a war hero, Yahweh is his name," this makes no sense at all and becomes meaningful only when one somehow renders the name as a bearer of meaning, entirely immaterial how: whether with "Lord" or with "Eternal" or otherwise.51 Rosenzweig prefers some translation over none. He even writes of the Eternal One as a favoured possibility when it clearly shows a connec- tion with-a breakthrough into-temporality. When Hermann Cohen said: "The Eternal is my shepherd," then this "the Eternal One" was only like a momentary upsurge of longing, which was overflooded by the blissful consciousness of the divine bending down, of the divine "humility," in the biblical "is my shep- herd." ... And how the great originator of the word, Calvin, labours, in his Commentary, to raise the eternally "Being" beyond Plato's "Being" to the eternally Mighty and eternally Redeeming.52 Rosenzweig understands that Mendelssohn eliminated the possibility of "the Lord" as the name for God because of its strong Christian overtones. Rosenzweig, however, prefers this choice over the Eternal 79</page><page sequence="18">Barbara E. Galli One. Insofar as "the Lord" is a paraphrase, Rosenzweig maintains that it does justice to the uniqueness of the divine name and that ... it renders the transparency of the name, its being illuminated by the meaning. And "the Lord" was an even better rendering than "the Eternal One," as it at least did not have a meaning which was closed in itself but one which pointed beyond itself: "the" Lord is always the Lord of the one opposite him at any given time and the one meeting him at any given time, always a word of relationship.53 In his letter to Goldner of 1927, Rosenzweig is less lenient with "Lord" as a possibility. "At the start we wrote Lord. This grew increasingly unbearable for us, because it is quite simply wrong. We told ourselves that one actually would sooner have to say the reverse: God for the name, and the Lord for Elohim. For God has for us something name- like, whereas Lord has the general notion of Elohim.... Then sud- denly, when the translation Lord had become desperately unbearable for us, the present translation occurred to us."54 Not surprisingly, "my Lord," appeals much more to Rosenzweig than either simply Lord, or the Eternal One. The term denotes vo- cativity and expresses a relationship with a God from whom the speaker experiences help. "The Hebrew Adonai as it had become in the mouth of the Prophets... retained (and retains to this day in Jewish usage) this heartfelt sound with an undertone of vocativity, of address and call, as indeed it is written quite predominantly in the vocative in the post-biblical prayer literature. ... And in Adonai there lay, to distinguish it from 'Lord,' visible every time, the real name with its connection to the moment of its revelation."55 MONOTHEISM AND THE REVELATION OF THE NAME Rosenzweig repeatedly stresses that Mendelssohn's clarification of the connection between name and revelation can never be overrated. For, by showing this connection in translation, one at the same time makes manifest biblical monotheism and the unity of the Bible.56 What depends on the demonstration of this connection is no less than the unity of the Bible. That is to say its unity as a uniform expression and outflow of the revelation of the one God. Expressed more learnedly and therefore more understandably: its unity under the principle of monotheism. The biblical "monotheism" does not after all consist in the recognition of a unity of the divine being. If it were, then it would lack any particularity: there is no "paganism" that has not ... combined its "polytheism," that is to say the fullness of its religious experiences, in the unity of something "religious" 80</page><page sequence="19">Rosenzweig and the Name for God altogether, be it in a hierarchy of gods, be it in a pantheon of gods, be it in identification of gods. Rather, the particularity of biblical faith in God consists in the fact that it indeed presupposes this "pagan" unity-to speak with the Kuzari: the god of Aristotle-but experiencing this God in his being-one most personally and di- rectly-again spoken with the Kuzari: recognizes the God of Abra- ham.... [H]eathen unity receives its, as it were, monotheistic point only through this Jewish identification of the far with the near God, the "whole" with the "particular" God.57 Rosenzweig's views on biblical anthropomorphisms are similar to and support what he is saying here about biblical monotheism. The ar- gument there follows the same main thrust as here: the lines of re- lationship between God and human being, approaching near and withdrawing afar. The so-called anthropomorphisms in the Bible are the safeguard of monotheism because they always depict an aspect of the divine- human relationship. As noted above, Rosenzweig contends that the "anthropomorphisms" are rather events of meetings, time-related, experiential events. From this, Rosenzweig concludes that the meet- ings are a verification, through experience, of encountering the same God again and again. The biblical "anthropomorphisms," then, teach us to whom to pray, that is the God who meets us in time, and time and time again. A meeting, however, means that (at least) two sepa- rable sides come together, but do not (cannot) unite. Each side draws near, walks away. When one experiences again and again a meeting with the divine side, along with "the courage to trust that the really experienced experiences of God also come really and immediately from God,"58 which both history and the "anthropomorphisms" attest to, then these "anthropomorphisms" are a testimony to monotheism. When God is believed to be utterly distant, or in the case of Men- delssohn's translation, is in danger of being only eternal, monotheism requires "protective armor." Rosenzweig writes: "The more God is banished into the distance all the more easily does man think that he may people the divine space, which is full of divine power-currents between God and himself, with half- and quarter-gods."59 Rosenzweig suggests that the usual definitions of biblical anthro- pomorphisms be abandoned. He suggests the following replacement which claims that biblical anthropomorphisms . . . stem from the unspoiled knowledge of the way in which God meets man: namely that He enters into his, the creature's concrete, i.e. momentary bodily-spiritual [leiblich-seelische] reality with equally concrete momentary corporeal-ensouled [leibhaft-seelenhaftem] meeting .... The assumption that they make is none other than the double one that the Bible commonly makes: namely that God is 81</page><page sequence="20">Barbara E. Galli capable of what he will (thus even of meeting the creature from time to time in fully bodily and spiritual reality) and that the creature is capable of what he should be (thus even of fully understanding and recognizing God's self-embodying or self-spiritualization turning to- wards him from time to time). For human beings, to express it now also psychologically, they are the single protection against the back- sliding into polytheism which indeed is nothing but consolidation of a genuine present revelation of the real God to a lasting image of God precisely by this means: resisting the ever-new will of God's revelation. What they could be for God Himself, however, the words of the Talmud were perhaps the first to indicate: that in each case God dispatches none of his messengers with more than one mes- sage.60 The divine-human meeting in which God Himself is the unmediated messenger and in which He reveals His name as revelation to Rosen- zweig is "the seed of the revelation of the Bible and that which makes it the Jewish Bible."61 This identification of revelation with name is that which, ... with its fire leaping forth from the burning bush out of the I AM THERE-call into the name of God, forges the whole Bible into one, in that it everywhere effects the equation of the God of Creation to the one present, to me, to you, -this equation whose fire burns hottest in the places where the name of God and the word for God rebound against each other, as in the Paradise chapters of Genesis or in the unifying call of "Hear, oh Israel," altogether the places where "the Eternal One" was not enough for Mendelssohn and he tried in his own way to secure entirely by the "the eternal being" the relationship to the revelation of the name in Exodus.62 Rosenzweig's final note in his essay is that, quite literally, the last word on translating the name rests in the Bible itself. [The Bible] is capable of chiming in with a tone which is foreign to it, which yet is a genuine human tone.... If the Bible did not have this hidden power to transform our errors into its truth, then it would be an even more hazardous enterprise than it already is. But that in itself is why the enterprise becomes imperative and a goal worthy of any effort. For this power of the Bible for transformation is the secret of its world-historical impact.63 Can this be so? Rosenzweig here confers upon the Bible full powers on the condition that human effort to translate its meaning never ceases. Upon the human being he imposes the imperative to attempt again and again to answer the most difficult questions of faith. Should our answers go astray, the Bible will lead us to the right path again. Is this persuasive today? With regard to Rosenzweig's philosophy as 82</page><page sequence="21">Rosenzweig and the Name for God set out in the Star, Robert Gibbs states that whatever else the book may be, "it is not a persuasive tract."64 But, as noted at the beginning, Gibbs sees in Rosenzweig's characterization of the scream as an open- ended question possibilities for postmodern and post-Holocaust think- ers. He sees relevance in Rosenzweig's two corollary questions (screams), which form today a nearly unbearable tension between each other: God's Where are you? and the human's Where are You? These two questions are implicit in Rosenzweig's conclusion of his Men- delssohn essay. On their relevance, Gibbs writes: We may benefit from Rosenzweig's two questions. They are ours. That scream is so eerie, most of all to our ears and eyes, because the scream is the very category that writers of the Holocaust invoke. EdmondJabes, the master of the question, writes, "The light of Israel is a scream to the infinite". For Jabes, the scream is the speech left us after the destruction, but like Rosenzweig he sees this as the speech of Israel. Rosenzweig would write that Jews are always survivors, and his identification of the scream may help to displace our as- sumptions that everything written before the atrocities of this century cannot address us after. We interrogate God most when God seems absent. We are not awaiting an answer, and we are still speaking to others. We are imploring both ourselves and others to hurry re- demption, to save our common humanity from itself. And yet we ask it of God, must as we name the first lover/commander God, because that redemption transcends the merely human, even though it appears only in the human.65 CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY NOTES 1.

Particularly with regard to Rosenzweig's notion of language as revelation, and to his carrying into his own philosophy the Kabbalist perception that "the Torah, the medium of Revelation, is nothing but a weave of divine names and that it really represents the Name of God itself, namely, the Tetragrammaton" (pp. 267-268), Moses is not to be dis- puted. In his essay on Mendelssohn, however, Rosenzweig is discussing the unity of the Bible and monotheism from a very earthbound and concretely experiential point of view. 57.
