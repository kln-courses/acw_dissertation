<plain_text><page sequence="1">OPINION Spread of allusions Bernard Dixon Times change. Thirty years ago, when I was doing my biology at school and varsity, the most heinous offence you could commit while speaking or writing was to use a phrase even remotely suggesting that there might be purpose or human connotation in biological phenomena. Teleology was an affront to rationality, anthropomorphism a naive idiocy. The most reviled concept of all was the notion that evolutionary changes could occur "for the good of the species." Beyond the pale altogether was the pan psychism of Jesuit palaeontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, whose 1959 best seller The Phenomenon of Man located the origins of human love in the propensity of sodium and chloride ions to unite as molecules of salt. Back in the mainstream of orthodox bioscience zoologist Colin Pittendrigh intro? duced the inoffensive, genteel term "tele nomic" so that biologists could without embarrassment state that the purpose of a nest, for example, was to protect young birds and mammals during their early weeks. As Sir Peter and Lady Medawar put it in Aristotle to Zoos (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1984), telenomy was "teleology purged of all its pr?tentions to providing causal explanations, and restricted exclusively to putting on record the purposes which biological structures and performances do in fact fulfil." Then in 1976 came what Peter Medawar described as "an exhilaratingly good book"? The Selfish Gene?by Oxford zoologist Richard Dawkins. A work whose very title would have given my former teachers apoplexy, The Selfish Gene traced natural selection down to the level of the gene, portraying the unit of survival as the self replicating DNA molecule, and individual organisms as surviving only to reproduce themselves with their cargo of hereditary material. As Richard recalled: "I conceived the metaphor?perhaps more than a metaphor ?of the individual body as a throw away survival machine existing only to preserve and propagate the genes." Selfish gene Dawkins repudiates those critics who have interpreted his thesis in terms of sociobiology and determinism. "To talk about a selfish gene is far less likely to give rise to mis? understanding than to talk about a selfish individual," he insisted in a recent interview. "To say that you are biologically programmed to be selfish really does lend itself to un? fortunate misuses. It can, for example, seem to endorse the sort of cut-throat market oriented society we in Britain call Thatcherism. DNA molecules, on the other hand, cannot have selfish or any other emotions, so the expression 'selfish gene' is obviously intended to be understood in its own spirit rather than be taken literally." So selfish genes and selfish DNA have taken root and become common parlance. The new Chambers Science and Technology Dictionary, published just a few months ago, confidently defines selfish DNA with as much certainty and lack of qualification as it defines constipation and haemoglobin. "Parasitic DNA" has attracted attention too, after the announcement by Francis Crick and others at the Salk Institute in 1980 that some plant and animal DNA is there purely "for the ride." And in his second book The Extended Phenotype, published in 1982, Richard Dawkins extended his own analysis to talk not only of selfish organisms and selfish spermatozoa but also of selfish mito? chondria and even selfish n?cleo tides. Now meet "the promiscuous steroid hormone receptor," which is causing dif? ficulties these days for our conventional understanding of how these hormones work. Although steroid hormones differ consider? ably in their effects, that model is all elegant simplicity. A steroid hormone traverses a cell membrane and binds to its corresponding receptor protein?and to no other. The "activated" complex of hormone and receptor then binds to a particular stretch of DNA laying close to the gene(s) regulated by that specific hormone. This action, in turn, affects the rate of transcription, and hence the expression, of the relevant genes. As with the matching of antigens with antibodies, or the lock and key docking of an enzyme and its substrate, the cardinal principle at work here is the specificity of molecular recognition. "Things ain't that simple" Nevertheless, as David Moore from Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, reports in the current issue of Trends in Neurosciences (1989;12:165) things ain't that simple. Different proteins in the thyroid hormone receptor family, for example, can interact functionally with a single DNA binding site. Likewise, a single DNA sequence can bind either the glucocorticoid receptor or the mineralocorti?oid receptor. In one sense these phenomena, which have been termed promiscuous bindings, are hardly surprising. The aminoacid sequences of the DNA-binding domains of the proteins concerned are similar. In light of the totally different biological effects of gluco corticoids and mineralocorticoids, however, such promiscuous behaviour is hard to square with the orthodox model of hormone action. The mouse mammary tumour virus pro? vides one of the most extreme and surprising examples of an inability to discriminate between various steroids. The promoter of this virus can be induced not only by gluco corticoids but also by androgens and pro? gesterone. This, it seems, is a consequence of the binding of the different receptors to either the same or overlapping sites. "Although these transfection experiments may not recreate the kinds of specific inter? action that would occur in more normal conditions," Moore writes, "they certainly suggest that the promiscuous binding obser? ved with purified proteins reflects a real possibility for unanticipated, overlapping biological effects. ' ' Nor is promiscuity restricted to steroid receptors. Another recent finding is that one of the thyroid hormone receptors in the rat has a similar DNA binding domain to that of human retinoic acid receptor alpha, and can indeed bind to the same DNA sequence. Moore sees this cross reaction as "surprising and interesting," though its importance will not be fully understood until we know more about the precise (or imprecise?) role of the retinoic acid receptor. We have come a long way from the arid objectivity exemplified by biology textbooks of the 1950s. Even allowing that, of course, these words are not supposed to be taken literally the spread of allusions of selfishness and promiscuity throughout the biological literature is remarkable. What on earth would Teilhard de Chardin have made of it all? 1528 BMJ volume 298 3 june 1989</page></plain_text>
