<plain_text><page sequence="1">Flcweró EDITORIAL A Threefold Cultural Bouquet Alberto Ruy Sánchez Lacy That form of life we call the flower, a fleeting moment of beauty, an apparition, an untamed yet perfect geometric structure, a cyclical being (the aesthetic measure of time); elixir and poison, exotic and familiar, a single color evoking blood and hope, a goddess and fecund flesh; the promise of death and the renewal of life, eternal youth and the plague of time; to science, a genus and species, but also a fiery sun god transformed into a diminutive and delicate being; a chained animal that thinks itself a plant, a receptacle of sacred sexuality; a message written in a secret language or the object of pure, aimless contemplation; a model of the universe or a fragile and insignificant trifle; an olfactory image, a provocative metaphor for the female sex... the splendid form we call a flower roams the cultures of the world, taking on distinct meanings and appearances for each. This issue of Artes de México is an introduction to a vast and fascinating topic: the role flowers play in Mexican culture. Here we offer a threefold bouquet of interpretations of this motif, corresponding to unique moments in our history. To begin with, the symbolism of flowers in the pre-Hispanic world is considered from three different perspectives. Next we discuss efforts during the Age of Enlightenment to document and classify American plant species. Two centuries later, an important scientific discovery has added yet another Mexican flower to this catalogue: Lacandonia schismatica, the only known species with inverted reproductive organs. To conclude we present a bird's-eye view of Mexico's thriving hothouse of artists who have used this motif from colonial times to the present. One up-and-coming painter illustrates Salvador Novo's poem A Floral Eulogy, which serves as a poetic garland to this issue. And so, we touch on Mexico's ancient floral mythology, demonstrating that it is still a vital topic today; we then revise our near-legendary botanical history, which continues to have an impact in the field; and finally we come to the late twentieth century, when the pictorial tradition as regards flowers is already classic in a sense but remains eternally fresh in the work of new artists who are increasingly attentive to the enduring expressive and symbolic power of the floral motif. In short, this is a three-pronged approach to a universe that resembles a mixed garden with multiple levels or terraces, and containing impeccably laid-out beds as well as plots of undergrowth where secrets are cultivated. Flowers of every order grow in the garden that is Mexican culture. They are a key symbolic element, at once ancient and vital, as well as ready material for the imagination.

He opened his sketchbook and with all the colors of the flowers he illustrated and brought into being everything that is born, lives and dies on the Earth. The mys tery of the flower that becomes a fruit, a seed, a sprout, the renewal of life, metaphor and song, a cherished reality that must also wither and die. Flowers meant innumerable things in the verbal expression of in digenous cultures. It could be said that the Mesoamerican universe was woven through with flowers, and indeed, they have not disap peared from what remains of it today. I will recount several stories of xochitlalpan, the land of flowers, and its close ties to indigenous beliefs, world view, rituals, celebrations, poetry, tales and oral history—in short, the very essence of life in pre Hispanic Mexico. In the world of the gods, our mother and father appeared under var ious guises. Among them we find those of Xochiquétzal, the pre cious flower, and Xochipilli, the prince of flowers. Both also bore the name of the calendar date Macuilxóchitl, or Five-Flower. The Mexicas left us beautiful sculptures of Xochipilli and Xochi quétzal. The former is seated in a position suggestive of an ecstatic state, his body and chair decorated with a multitude of flowers, some of them perhaps recalling hallucinogenic mushrooms. Also forming part of the National Museum of Anthropology's collection, a female figure with a face of particular beauty and depicted crouched in in digenous fashion seems to represent Xochiquétzal. In books of paintings and glyphs there are a number of representa tions of Xochipilli and Xochiquétzal. For instance the Codex Borgia depicts her playing a rattle and a turtle shell while he, in front of her, plays a wooden kettledrum. In the Codex Borbonicus, Xochipilli presides over the fourth thirteen-day cycle with the sign One-Flower. Scrolls representing speech issue from his mouth. The largest one ends in a flower and symbolizes singing. In turn, accompanying the nineteenth group of thirteen days bearing the sign One-Eagle, Xo chiquétzal appears on her throne of precious flowers. Two flowers also blossom from her mouth, representing rhythmic speech. These books were studied at the calmécac or priests' colleges where songs, speeches and stories were also composed and memorized. The first page of the Tonaldmatl or Codex Fejérváry-Mayer—the astrolog ical calendar of the pochteca or armed Aztec merchants—bears a rep resentation of the Mesoamerican conception of the universe. It is di vided into four major cosmic directions, in addition to the central region ruled by Xiuhtecuhtli, the Lord of Fire. In each cosmic quadrant there are two gods and, towering over them, a tree with flowers. These are the flowering world trees. In the east ern quadrant we see above them a quetzalcuahuitl or quetzal tree with striking blue-and-yellow flowers. To the left in the north, a mesquite bearing yellow-and-white blooms has an eagle perched in its branch es. Down below in the west stands a majestic quetzalpóchotl or ceiba tree with its unmistakable white flowers and a hummingbird in its crown. To the right in the south we see a dog and a cacao tree, whose flowers are also white and have open corollas. Mixtee books of history and genealogy also contain drawings of flow ers skillfully rendered in vivid colors. Accompanied by the glyph for mountain which also means geological formation or town, flowering plants and trees refer to place names. Flowers shown held by a hu man figure, in religious images or inside or on top of houses, palaces and temples may symbolize precious offerings, the development of life, wonder and mystery. These codices are so densely sown with flowers that they could easily be considered xochiamoxtli or flower ing books. And the chroniclers who recited the books' contents aloud must have also been considered true xochitlahtoleh, masters of "flowery" or poetic speech. The connotations bestowed upon flowers in the universe of Meso american ceremonies were as varied as their petals. Florid language resonates time and again in songs. Certain flowers also performed the double role of offering and metaphor in ritual ceremonies, dan ces and as part of the attire of both gods and humans. The sacred cycle of holy days was governed by calendrical calculations that es tablished a system of twenty symbols, the last one being xochitl or flower. Flowers are also present in many forms in the eighteen twenty day cycles of the solar calendar on which Mesoamericans based their liturgy. Thus the first twenty-day month was called Xilomanaliztli, "offering of the unripe corn cob's efflorescence;" the ninth month was Tlaxochimaco, "the time when flowers are given;" while the name of the last month varied regionally, sometimes called Xochilhuitl, "festival of flowers," or else Izcalli, "return to life." In the codices, multicolored flowers, garlands and necklaces arranged in different ways represented holy days and rituals. Their names are a litany of marvels: cacahuaxóchitl, "cacao flower"; cempoalxóchitl, the brilliant yellow marigold; tlilxóchitl, the climbing vanilla orchid; chimalxóchitl, "shield flower"; oceloxóchitl, the tigerflower; ayoxóchitl, the squash blossom; cocoxóchitl, "turtledove flower" or wild dahlia; omixóchitl, "bone flower" or tuberose; aztaxóchitl, "heron-colored flower"; yoloxóchitl, "flower of the heart"; cacaloxóchitl, "crow flow er" or frangipani; coyolxóchitl, "rattle flower" or salsilla; chilpanxóchitl, "flower that grows in the chili field" or fuchsia; neucxóchitl, "honey flower"; huitzilxóchitl, "hummingbird flower"; macpalxóchitl, the hand tree; tecomaxóchitl, the chalice vine; tepexiloxóchitl, "wild corn-silk flower"; xiloxóchitl, "young corn flower". This list of Mesoamerican flowers could go on if we recall the xochi milla or cultivated flower beds and the xochitlalli where wildflowers grew. Moreover, some heartfelt memory may summon up an enchant ing xochicuicatl, "flowered song," or xopancuicatl, "song of spring." In indigenous languages, flowers are associated with music, dance and singing. The meaning of the compound expression xochitl-cuicatl or flower-song is similar to our present-day concepts of poetry, metaphor, art and beauty. Preserved in old manuscripts, mostly in Náhuatl but also to a lesser extent in Maya and other tongues, these songs still contain magic and mystery. Flowers also evoke the community of friends, the power to speak the truth on Earth, in war and in sacrifice. They evoke the memory that mortals leave in song when they depart from this world. They symbolize love and sensuality, the search for the Giver of Life, the desire for happiness, and also death. Like the flower, all of these can be pleasurable and sometimes even intoxicating, but must eventu ally fade and wither. In a brief poem attributed to Nezahualcóyotl, xochitl-cuicatl acquires its deepest meaning: one can surround oneself with flowers and song and yet only by discovering what is truly xochitl-cuicatl—poetry, met aphor, art and beauty—may one be happy on Earth. "We adorn our selves, we are enriched/ with flowers, with song,/ with the flower of spring;/ we adorn ourselves with them here on Earth.// In the end my heart knows:/1 listen to a song,/1 gaze upon a flower,/ and I only hope they will not fade!" (Romances de los señores de Nueva España). Having glimpsed the possible significance of flowers and song, many cuicapicque or Nahua poets were led to conceive of their existence as a quest for that which provides roots and at least fleeting joy in this world. In the words of one lyricist: "I ask my heart,/ Where will I find beautiful fragrant flowers?/ Who will tell me?/ The brilliant green hummingbird?/ Or perhaps the golden butterfly?/ Surely they will know/ where lovely fragrant flowers bloom.// I shall go deep 82 Miguel León-Portilla</page><page sequence="3">niiiiiwn.ii into the wood of blue-green firs/ or into the forest of flame-colored flowers/ where they bow to the dew-damp soil,/ where in the radi ant sunlight/ they reach perfection one by one./ Perhaps I will see them there/ when the creatures show them to me;/1 will put them in my cloak/ and thus hail the nobles/ and with them court the princes" (Cantares mexicanos). Other paths will take us to the cacao flowers, the toasted-corn flow ers, the shield flowers and the flowers of the heart: "Priests, I ask you,/ where do the flowers that agitate hearts come from?/ Where do the intoxicating songs come from?// The beautiful songs come only/ from their house, from heaven./ Only from their house do the manifold flowers come,/ the Giver of Life causes them to descend,/ the young corn flower is strewn./ On the flowers sings the quechol bird/ whose neck is of rubber./ It rejoices, it is happy" (Cancares mexicanos). Beautiful flowers and songs are bestowed by the Giver of Life but, as another poet states, "our desire makes them ugly, our inventive ness spoils them." Nonetheless, it is already something to know that flowers and songs, being divine gifts, bloom deep within the heart. The following was said of the wise Lord Nezahualcóyotl: "On a car pet of flowers you paint your song, your words,/ O! Prince Nezahual cóyotl./ Your heart is in the painting./ With flowers of every hue/ you paint your song, your words,/ O! Prince Nezahualcóyotl" (Ro mances de los señores de Nueva España). A poem by another lyricist reiterates the idea under a different guise: "I come, I have arrived,/1 come from the sea, from under the water/ where the dawn shines brightly./1 am a bard,/ my heart is a flower,/ I make an offering of flowers" (Cantares mexicanos). Flower offerings are made in many different ways. In wartime they are the hearts of warriors whose lives are surrendered like flowers: "There bloom the cacao flowers,/ the toasted-corn flowers, in Mex ico they grow/ and their corollas open./ It is only there that nobil ity is found,/ the eagles and tigers [...]// The shield flower/ will thus wither/ on the plain of Anáhuac./ He will cut it down [...]/ Flowers of precious water,/ flowers of fire: combat./ They are our shroud,/ the flowers of war./ Friends, eagles,/ jaguars, adorn yourselves./ He cuts them down on the plain:/ they are the flowers of war" (Romances de los señores de Nueva España). The subject of flowers is as complex as a symphony, so I will touch on only a few recurrent motifs as illustrated in the following verses: "The corollas of the flowering tree of friendship are opening [...]/ I have come here to delight in the frangipani and the marigold [...]/ Only with flowers will our song rise up [...]/ The eagle flower has sprouted buds [...]/1 yearn for the flowers that intoxicate [...]/ Must I go like the flowers that have died?/ Are flowers taken to the land of the dead?/ You hold us in esteem like a flower [...]" This article offers but a mere glimpse at this vast domain. We are in xochitlalpan, the land of flowers where to this day there are vital cul tures that speak Náhuatl, Maya, Mixtee, Zapotee and Otomí, and which have produced many masters of flower and song. Juan Grego rio Regino, a Mazatec poet from Oaxaca, reaches an eloquent con clusion in these lines he wrote in Mazatec and then translated into Spanish: "Where did the power/ of magic and words die?/ Under what spell has our sensibility/ for the flower and for the seed fallen?// Is it true that all God's creations must perish?/ Then how is it that the Sun disappears only to return?/ How is it that the Moon changes but does not die?/ Might our lives be lights/ that flare up and then fade away?" Regino himself provides an answer to these questions. The ancient power of magic and speech, the magical emotions expressed by flow ers and seeds, have not really perished. The indigenous word is a light that flares up again, a sun that vanishes but returns. Whether in Ma zatec, Náhuatl, Maya, Zapotee or any other Mexican language, the ancient literary heritage and new poetry and prose stand as proof of this. &amp; Translated by Richard Moszka. REVELATION OF WAR Reaping Flowers jjcr Huitzilcpcchtli Dominique Dufétel For a long time I dreamt of war every day, but I can't remem ber those dreams ever having taken on a distressing tone. They were a horrifying part of my oneiric life and I came to accept them entirely. Reading Julio Cortázar's short story "La noche boca arriba" (The Night Faceup), I felt for the first time the fear of a hunted man in wartime. "There was no sound," the narrator recalls, "but fear lingered like an aroma, that sickly sweet incense of the wars of flowers." Like the Mayan raids of the Classic period—illustrated in a sec tion of the Bonampak murals—and the ritual abductions of the Quiché Maya, the Aztec wars of flowers did not endeavor to con quer peoples or new territories but to procure more sacrifice vic tims. For this same reason, the character in Cortázar's story is over come by terror—more than a warrior's natural fear of death in combat, it is the dread of falling prisoner, of being torn to pieces alive and offered to the gods, of being cooked and even eaten. In his book La Conquéte divine de Michoacán, writer Jean-Marie Le Clézio provides a clue as to the possible origin of this warrior ritu al, which he aptly refers to as a fiesta. "Michoacán's war fiestas recall the well-known Aztec ritual of the War of Rowers," he writes. "But the Purépecha rites were so powerful it is conceivable this Michoa cán civilization influenced Anáhuac. In fact, they are likely a hold over from a common culture, attesting to the existence of a no madic Chichimec civilization perhaps originating in North America as forerunner to the great empires of Middle America. The first of these war fiestas is linked to a religious belief prevalent through out Central America: the cult of the New Fire, associated with the end of calendrical cycles. [...] First, firewood and small pellets of fra grance were taken to the temple pyres. Then the priest pronounced the name of all [the Purépechas'] enemies, 'starting with Mexico Tenochtitlán,' so the gods might assist in their defeat, resulting in many captives. [...] Next, 'they tossed all those pellets of fragrance onto the fires burning in front of the cm [an altar in the form of a mound]' [...] The pyres and incense burned and smoked for two nights and at the end of this ecstatic carnival of fire and fragrance, the cruel ceremony of ritual war began. Then the cazonci, clad in his lordly insignia, convoked all the warriors of the province and sent squadrons of 'brave men' to every border with the mission of bat tling the kingdom's enemies. The warriors were expected to return with a great number of captives who would be confined in a place called Curuzequare, where they awaited the day they would be sac rificed on the altars of the gods." Cortázar shrewdly integrates the dimension of smell into his nar rative, and curiously, Le Clézio also detects it in the origins of the Purépecha ritual. But is scent not an integral dimension of the very nature of the flower? However, no reference was ever made to flowers by the Purépechas, the Maya or the Quichés when dis cussing that same bellicose custom. It appears to have been the ex clusive privilege of the Nahua to associate them with ritual war and sacrifice. Thus it was the people of "flowers and song" who imbued the practice with a poetic dimension which from the perspective of contemporary Western culture may strike us as paradoxical for its inherent cruelty. Mexica poets made constant reference to the flow ers and songs of their own literary production but also to that other lethally fragrant flower—the flower of war. "The war of flowers, the shield of flowers,/ these flowers have blos somed./ They are creating a clamor;/ they are sweet-smelling and fall like rain..." (Xicoténcatl). "It is only turning, the shield flower// the richly fragrant flower./ We hold it in our hands,/ close to the water, upon the still water,/ 83 Dominique Dufétel Richard Moszka</page><page sequence="4">it will be harvested by God.// Flowers of the divine liquor,/ flow ers of the home fires:/ they are our only adornment,/ the flowers of war" (Romance de los señores de Nueva España). In his book La Fleur létale: Economie du sacrifice azteque, Christian Duverger attributes a more ancient origin to the war of flowers, and suggests yet another meaning for the flower: "As war was a strictly observed duty, the Aztecs were obliged to create an unusual insti tution: the xochiyaóyod, or wars of flowers. It is believed that Tla caélel devised this practice in the wake of the devastating famine of 1450, believed to have been sent by discontented gods due to a dearth of sacrificial victims. By mutual consent, two alliances were organized: Mexico-Tenochtitlán, Tlacopan and Texcoco on the one hand and Tlaxcala, Uexotzinco and Cholula on the other. The two sides agreed to wage war against each other at regular intervals with the sole objective of capturing prisoners to offer in sacrifice. The truth of the matter was that the Pax Azteca had spread throughout the Mexican Altiplano and the Nahuas found it impossible to keep up a steady flow of human victims for their altars. The river of blood had to continue flowing down the pyramids' stone steps at all costs, and thus emerged the xochiyaóyod or 'war game' (as xochid or flower invariably has the connotation of 'game'), placing in sharp relief the fact that the ultimate goal and primary motive for war was none other than sacrifice." "They have returned to their homes, the owners of withered flow ers,/ the possessors of feathered shields,/ those who guard the high lands,/ those who take prisoners alive,/ they are already dancing [...]// The flower of the liquor of war/ has intoxicated my prince,/ the yellow Lord of the Cuextecas./ Matlaccuiatzin is bathed in the florid liquor of war./ Together they go to the place where one still exists in some form" (Colección de cantares mexicanos). It is clear the nectar extracted from that ancient flower was hu man blood and in particular, the blood of sacrifice (the sickly sweet odor of Cortázar's "flowery war" emanated from ritual censers as well as from bloodstained altars). Though the association of blood with fire, heat and life may be prevalent in most societies, in modern times it is often tied to a feeling of repulsion or of the imminence of death. Mesoamerican societies cast it in an entirely different light. Blood was not only valued as a symbol of life but as a divine element we carry within us—"precious water" (chalchihuatl) that could serve as food for the gods. As such, flower petals—ethereal as bird feath ers or a butterfly's wings—were closely linked to blood, fire, the sun and holy wars. "I have arrived: I, Deer Two-Rabbit;/ Rabbit who bleeds, Deer of large antlers. [...]// The bloodstained Rabbit has come;/ upon his ar rival flowers are scattered over him./ Gaze upon him, my nephews./ The golden butterfly is sipping the nectar/ of my heart which has opened into a flower, my friends./ It is a fragrant flower and I scat ter it far and wide.// I scatter flowers of war, I of the smiling face,/ because I come from the war" (Colección de cantares mexicanos). Thus the blood of sacrifice flowed on a daily basis, "fragrant flowers were scattered" to appease the mysterious desires of the gods—the creators of the world—so the delicate balance of the cosmos might not be upset, so the sun might return every day and so there might be fire, rain and corn. But something seems to be missing from this common interpretation of the wars of flowers and their corollary, human sacrifice: a deep er meaning, as if we were seeing only the outer, visible facet of the phenomenon of flower worship. Researcher Laurette Séjourné considers Aztec ideology and ritual practice to be a degeneration of the spiritual beliefs of the ancient Nahua peoples—principally the inhabitants of Teotihuacan, for merly called Tollan. In her view, the Aztec wars of flowers were an atrocious imposition. "This occurred," states Séjourné, "when Tlax cala was forced to surrender after a debilitating siege by the Aztecs. What tribute could Tenochtitlán possibly levy from such a poor city? At that point it was decreed that Tlaxcala be converted into a permanent battleground to capture men whose fate was to be come food for the Sun." Séjourné sustains this thesis throughout an essay which, after an alyzing the ruined city of the gods (Teotihuacan) as well as codices and chronicles, attempts to capture the essence of Nahua thought, based on a mainly symbolic reading of signs appearing primarily in paintings, murals and on ceramics. Her interpretation is that the Nahua people were constantly seeking their spiritual salvation— a hypothesis which has often been rejected in past decades but whose value is undeniable as an alternative to all other possible and necessary readings of pre-Hispanic history. According to both Séjourné and the parable of Quetzalcóatl, king of Tollan, salvation is easily attained: "For an individual to reconcile his spirit with the matter from which he is formed, he must wage a painfully conscious war throughout his life, converting himself into a battlefield where these two enemies clash without respite. The victory of one or the other will determine the individual's life or death: if matter is the victor, his spirit is annihilated; if the spirit is triumphant, the body blossoms and a new light is absorbed by the Sun, adding to its strength." Later she adds, "The purpose of the schools where nobles were initiated into the mysteries of their religion was to 'cause flowers to grow out of the body.'" This is the other facet of sacrifice: it was not about wrenching out the hearts of foreigners, prisoners and slaves; rather, to the Aztecs it meant "wrenching the heart out of the destructive multiplicity." The Aztecs inherited and assimilated a profound spiritual tradition and perverted it to suit their tastes, but in myths and rites docu mented by the Spaniards, the original source of the ancient reli gion could still be detected. An example of this is the myth re garding the foundation of Mexico-Tenochtitlán: "Why would the Aztecs have built their capital in the place where they discovered a stone that gave forth flowers and a spring whose 'nearly blood red' water 'divided into two streams, and in the second the water flowed so thick and blue it was frightening.' What could these por tents signify but the doctrine which instructs us that matter 'grows and flowers' by means of the struggle to nullify adversaries? To be gin with, in Aztec art the fruits of that miraculous stone [the prick ly pears growing on cacti] take on the form of human hearts. In ad dition, the 'wars of flowers' that men must wage within themselves to gain their freedom are symbolized by two streams similar to the ones mentioned. The trophy that the warrior pursued [or was sup posed to pursue] was none other than his own soul." Thus, for Séjourné, the flower of the body could refer only to the soul, but in a pure, primitive sense. The association of the flower with the Sun is unquestionable; indeed, a four-petal flower is one of the hieroglyphs referring to the sun: "During the ninth month, festivities dedicated to Huitzilopochtli [the preeminent solar god] consisted exclusively of floral offerings. It is no coincidence that the only monthly ceremony not involving human sacrifice was dedicated to the sanguinary Huitzilopochtli. Clearly, flowers were souls generously offered to the Sun." In the Florentine Codex we read that "when prisoners died [in sac rifice] Motecuhzoma was said to be revived: through them he was fortified with tonalli (a psychic force equivalent to the soul), through them he could stand erect [...] as if rejuvenated by them, and thus he lived longer; through them he was filled with glory and became powerful: thus he inspired fear." Thus, it would appear that the maximum and ultimate instigator of the wars of flowers—the principal cause of human sacrifice in pre-Hispanic Mexico—was capable (or believed capable) of avert ing the ancient law of the soul's liberation, not for the sake of a cosmos that ran smoothly but for personal and physical gain. In this 84</page><page sequence="5">way a correspondence was established between the two facets of the sacrificial flower: the pure image proposed by Séjourné (though she perhaps states her case in overly Westernized language) and the tra ditional finalist image, whose legitimacy was established not only by the Aztecs but by every militarist in history who has recognized war and its consequent sacrifice of human life as a necessary evil. Lately, to my misfortune, I have again begun to dream of war. A. Translated by Michelle Suderman. COSMIC REVELATION Flcweró of) the Soul Xavier Lozoya A traveler's aid: pulverize dried mecaxóchitl, tlixóchitl and hueynacaztli flowers [...] and place the powder in the hollow of that well-known and fragrant flower, huacalxóchitl [...] or take a bloom from the celebrated yoloxóchitl, carefully make a hollow and in it place the restorative powder and hang this little container around your neck. Martín de la Cruz and Juan Badiano Libellus de Medicinabilus Indorum Herbis The flower was one of the basic elements of symbolic communication between Mesoamerican peoples. Archaeologists and historians have shown that in pre-Hispanic Mexico, flora represented life, death, creation, the gods, man, language, song, art, friendship, nobility, war, Heaven and Earth, as well as being a calendrical emblem. The world was conceptualized as an enormous terrestrial platform that took the shape of a four-petal flower upon which lived humans and animals, surrounded by mountains, caves, rivers and lakes, grasses and trees. Basic education in Mexican schools, even during the post-war pe riod, taught that some cultures—Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, India or China, for example—imagined that elephants or giant turtles sup ported the Earth, yet no reference was made to the cosmogonic vi sion of the ancient Mexicans. This was due partly to the fact that there was still a lack of knowledge on the subject and also because research and diffusion of such matters was (and continues to be) the domain of very few. The Mesoamericans viewed the cosmos as a rectangular paral lelepiped and Earth as a platform surrounded by a sea forming four giant walls of salt water that extended to heaven at the outer lim its of the universe. Above the platform of Earth they visualized thir teen heavens or celestial planes. The first four "lower heavens" com posed Tlaltipac ("belonging to the surface of the Earth") and their combined height corresponded to that of the saltwater walls origi nating in the sea. The following nine "upper heavens" formed Chic nauhtopan ("nine places that lie above us"). Beneath the Earth in habited by man lay Chicnauhmictlan ("the nine places of death") composed of an additional nine terrestrial planes that were cold un derworlds, dark and dank, abounding in latent riches (seeds and met als) as well as being the source of drinking water, the fundamental el ement for the generation of life. In this cosmic schema, the roof (corresponding to the two uppermost heavens) was called Omeyoa can and was the seat of duality, the pivotal concept behind Meso american cosmovision. The explanation for the diversity, order and movement of the cosmos was based on the concept of the con frontation of dual opposites; everything was brought into existence through the action of Heaven and Earth, hot and cold, light and darkness, man and woman, strength and weakness, above and be low, rain and drought—opposite and complementary poles, mani festations of a dual entity that governed the cosmos. The roof men tioned earlier was supported by four gigantic trees (ceibas in the Mayan world; amates on the central Altiplano) which marked the vertices of the parallelogram. Various colors, gods, birds and sym bols identified each corner of the basic quadrilateral that made up the world. The gigantic cosmic trees also indicated the four points of the compass or the sectors that divided the horizon as seen from the terrestrial platform. As such, the East was symbolized by the color white, the West by red, the South by blue and the North by black. Using the same four colors, these regions were represented schematically as the petals of a flower whose vertices joined in a circle drawn at the center—the navel of the world—represented as green in color. The different peoples or tribes originated at this central point which, depending on the culture, was also symbolized by a tree, hill, rock, spring or cave, or abstractly by a circle that al lowed communication between the four directions and the upper and lower cosmic planes. This model was governed by a complex dynamic given that every thing was conceived as being in perpetual movement. This was evi dent in the cyclical changes in position of some of its elements: the Sun's trajectory across the third heaven, Venus and the stars in the second heaven and the Moon which transited the first heaven. Clouds were born in the subterranean levels, rising to the Earth's sur face from within the mountains and continuing through the heaven ly planes until they crashed into the roof of the uppermost heaven and subsequently descended in the form of rain, thus giving life to terrestrial flora and to the plants and animals of the sea. Thus each flower was the image of the cosmos in miniature: the dynamic forces that ruled the macrocosmos were present even in the most unassuming of wildflowers. Medicinal Aroma The complex thought system of ancient Mesoamerican cultures con ceived of a force called tonalli that animated living things. This noun has various interrelated meanings, including radiation, solar heat, light and destiny. During the colonial period this was trans lated into Spanish as alma (soul), a term suffused with Catholic reli gious doctrine. Today tonalli is seen as being closer to the current concept of energy, manifested for ancient Mexicans as light-heat which bathed the Earth's surface and filtered into all inhabitants of the cosmic flower. Time and transformation—in other words, earthly existence itself—were also produced by the action of this energy. Each day a new tonalli emerged from among the four cosmic trees to link the mythic time of heaven &gt;vith human time. Each tonalli had a name produced by the union of a number with a particular image (i.e. reed, house, flint knife, rabbit). There were twenty figures that combined with thirteen numbers to form the cycle of 260 units (One-Reed, Two-Reed, Three-Reed...Thirteen-Reed; One-House, Two-House, Three-House.. .Thirteen-House and so forth), which in turn corresponded to the number of days in the calendar used for divination. Thus each day had its own tonalli or particular energy. Each individual was energetically determined by the tonalli of his or her day of birth and thenceforth was subject to the daily fluctua tions in the energy that flowed through the world. The days dif fered on an energetic level and these oscillations could alter an in dividual's state of health, producing certain illnesses. Doctors were thus obliged to know the dominant influences for each person and find healing methods that would restore the tonalli of those suffer ing from an "energetic imbalance." Only in recent years has Occiden tal medicine begun to understand the condition known as "losing tonalli" or "loss of soul"—still recognized by pathologies incorpo rating indigenous knowledge—which medical anthropology has identified as equivalent to depressive states, mental fatigue, in somnia, anxiety and so forth. Flowers were the most frequently used medicine for treating these unbalanced states, and even in the re mote past they appear to have fulfilled their purpose from both a theoretical and a practical point of view. The most valued property of flowers was their fragrance, which in pre-Hispanic medicine seems to have exerted a primary healing 85 Xavier Lozoya</page><page sequence="6">C *ay»íi it*, Á &amp;3L \ S I Í i ( I \ kingdom allowed them to perfect their techniques in agriculture, fruitgrowing, horticulture, forestry and—most importantly—med icine. The goddess Ixchel, often represented in ceramic figurines, as well as the hermaphroditic Chortf god Ah Vincir Dza'car ("Man of Remedies") were invoked during the curative practices of this advanced and learned society of southeastern Mesoamerica. Mayan knowledge of the ontogenetic, hermaphroditic and pluri sexual character of flowers—as confirmed by eighteenth-century Linnaean taxonomic philosophy—was reflected in the medical func tions which were attributed to the androgynous nature of the god Ah Vincir Dza'car, whose male aspect cured men while the female aspect cured women. In another context and time, Fray Bernardino de Sahagún docu mented the worship of Toltec goddess Temazcalteci, considered "the grandmother of baths, the goddess [...] of medicine and medicinal herbs; doctors and surgeons and blood-letters worshipped her, as did midwives and the women who administered abortive herbs, and also oracles who foresaw the good or bad fortune of children ac cording to their date of birth." With their worship of these deities and their proficient use of the substances they had discovered, Mesoamericans constructed a uni verse of magico-religious, medical, horticultural, ornamental, pic torial, passionate, poetic and literary meanings which continue to be expressed in the work of artists and artisans. Intolerance The first works on Mexican flora find their antecedents in some of the few codices preserved to this day. Judging from historical sources such as the Badianus, Borgia and Florentine Codices, the art (or science?) of healing was the most extensive field of knowledge in Mesoamerican cultures. With naturopathy, plants were considered a primal component of healing and their constitutive elements were seen as substances which, once modified, could be used to treat im balances in the human organism. function. Their aroma accompanied and protected travelers as they crossed rivers and estuaries; it cured and comforted those who suf fered from fatigue or from insomnia. Medicine for the melancholy and the unhappy, it eased the pain of an unbalanced tonalli and opened up communication with cosmic forces. The medicinal flowers of ancient Mexicans are now classified ac cording to pharmacological properties, dividing them into two major groups: those containing substances that modify the chemical con tent of the brain, thus inducing altered states of consciousness—such as toloache (Datura stramonium), casahuate (lpomoea arborescens), te coma (Solandra grandiflora), floripondio (Burgmansia arbórea), picietl or wild tobacco (Nicotiana rustica) and mecapatli or common morning glory (lpomoea purpurea)—and those used to produce essential oils with aromatic properties exerting a powerful effect on the nervous and endocrine systems, such as ttixóchitl (Vanilla planifolia), cacaloxó chitl or frangipani (Plumería alba) and yoloxóchitl (Talauma mexicana). Recently, scientific research into brain function has extended our knowledge of the complex workings of the sense of smell and its di rect anatomical and functional relationship to the nervous struc tures responsible for emotion and behavior. The olfactory nerves are connected to the limbic system, seat of the cerebral organization controlling behavior. This system coordinates the operation of the nervous structures regulating emotions. In modern times we have begun to elucidate the complex nervous and hormonal relationships determining physiological responses to the odors we perceive as well as the medicinal and aromatic prop erties of the "flowers of the soul."

Since the nomadic tribes first dis covered corn and became sedentary agricultural communi ties 5000 years ago, native peoples found in the properties of plant roots, stems, leaves, branches and petals an indispensable compan ion. Their importance remains evident in various artistic expres sions, in indigenous cosmogony, ritual ceremonies, magico-religious invocations and in the discovery of nutritious foods. The aesthetic qualities of plants were a source of inspiration to the tlacuilo, scribes who with the aid of a painting nib illustrated the amoxtli or "reading books." On paper made from cotton, maguey or amate bark fibers and even on hides, they recorded everything from the history of the different tribes to the medicinal properties of plants and flowers. But it is perhaps in Mesoamerican poetry where flowers—symbol of fertility, aroma of love and passion, final companion at the mo ment of death—found their most intense expression. The signifi cance of these texts seems even more vital today as we witness an insidious process of environmental destruction. Mesoamerican Roots In the cosmovision of the Quiché Maya (from the Quiché region of present-day Guatemala), humankind was thought to have been created from corn, the basic staple of the Mexican and Central American diet. Quiché civilization cultivated a system of thought drawn from a mixture of magic, religion and science.

During the 300 years of colonial rule, the obscurantism introduced by the Spaniards drastically undermined botanical knowledge in Mesoamerican societies. Because medical practice and awareness of the properties of plants were so closely tied to rituals, ceremo nies and other customs, the conquistadors systematically destroyed the fruits of indigenous efforts to conserve and document the uses of plants. Determined to impose a new religion, the Spaniards sup pressed expressions of aboriginal culture. The cultivation of a wide variety of products such as tobacco and amaranth was either con trolled or outlawed, and their use in rituals was fiercely persecuted by the Inquisition. Between Imagination and Light Military, religious and spiritual subjection was followed by the ex ploitation of natural resources until complete economic control was achieved. Scholars, lawyers, legislators, doctors, pharmacists and naturalists followed in the footsteps of swordsmen and evangelists. In the late sixteenth century, tales of the peoples, plants and ani mals of America intensely (though briefly) piqued the Spanish mon archy's interest. There was talk of miraculous potions made from plants, legendary fountains of youth and vitality, mythic animals unknown to Europeans, Edenic landscapes, exotic fruits with aphro disiac powers.... All this spawned a new teratology, with literature and visual art that depicted outlandish monsters such as those de scribed by Munster in 1544, Gesner in 1560 and Aldrovani in 1642, among other European scientists. The boundless imagination of col onists sparked a feverish quest for precious metals to exploit and new experiences to be had through the use of medicinal plants. One source that sheds some light upon indigenous naturopathy is the Codex Badianus, Libellus de Medicinabilus Indorum Herbis (Book of Indian Medicinal Herbs, Tlatelolco, 1552), recently returned to Mexico by the Vatican and now held at the library of the National Museum of Anthropology. Originally written in Náhuatl by Martin de la Cruz and known as the Codex Badianus due to the fact that Xochimilco native Juan Badiano authored a Latin translation of the text, it is a post-Conquest compendium of medicinal plants and their applications. The book captured the attention of Philip II of Spain, and on Jan uary 11, 1570, he sent his personal physician, Francisco Hernández, to prepare a detailed report on New Spain's mineral resources, abo riginal customs and the curative properties of native plants. During the nearly seven years he spent studying the colony's flora, fauna and minerals, Hernández journeyed to Michoacán, Colima and Querétaro, and south to Oaxaca and the Isthmus of Tehuan tepec. He scoured the present-day states of Morelos, Guerrero and Puebla, visiting monasteries, haciendas and convents, enduring ill ness and disastrously inclement weather, traveling in litters and on muleback. He was accompanied by copyists and artists who made botanical illustrations using pigments extracted from the plants they documented, later to be compiled in Hernández's monumental work consisting of seventeen handwritten volumes, of which La natura leza y virtudes de las plantas y animales de Nueva España (The Nature and Properties of the Plants and Animals of New Spain) is espe cially noteworthy. Compelled to return to Spain, both by the king and by the many illnesses he was suffering, he took his books and transcripts of oral accounts, as well as a large shipment of seeds in flowerpots and crates, many of which (as documented by historian Germán Somolinos d'Ardois in 1982) have grown to be stout trees still standing in the gardens of Seville's Alcázar Palace. One hundred years later, Hernández's valuable work had been rec ognized by botanists and naturalists throughout Europe but remained unknown in Mexico. On June 17,1671, the library of the El Escorial monastery, which held his original manuscript as well as an inde terminate number of plant and animal drawings, fell prey to a fire which burned for two weeks before it could be extinguished. Her nández's manuscripts were lost—along with other extremely valu able works such as the 400 Arabic manuscripts taken from the Moors in the Reconquest, Chinese manuscripts, hundreds of incunabula and the Turkish standard, won in the Battle of Lepanto. This was another great loss to Mexican natural history. Fortunately, we can still refer to Germán Somolinos D'Ardois's magnum opus published by the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM)—the most thorough review of Hernández's work available. The Royal Botanical Expedition, 1787-1803 Spanning fifteen years of work on the part of scientists, artists and naturalists, the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Spain was a mile stone in the history of the identification and study of Mexico's nat ural resources—if nothing else, for its very magnitude in terms of time and effort. Led by José Mariano Mociño and Martín de Sessé, it covered over 30 000 kilometers of terrain in an effort to discover, classify and sketch plants, mammals, fish, insects and minerals new to Western science. They also described autochthonous customs, geo graphical features, volcanic eruptions and other relevant details by means of illustrations and scientific texts which have proved invalu able to the fields of ethnography, anthropology, art and science. The expedition bequeathed us a legacy of graphic material that con stitutes a vital contribution to scientific historiography, as well as bearing witness to the great artistic skill of the pioneering illustra tors trained at the Academy of San Carlos in Mexico City, which opened its doors in 1781. They created the first pictorial records in which science and art complemented each other, paving the way for modern documentation of natural history. Aragonese physician Martín de Sessé y Lacasta was assigned to track down any copies of drawings, paintings and manuscripts left in New Spain by the medical examiner Francisco Hernández; this search would eventually be the motive for a botanical expedition led by Sessé. While in New Spain, he would establish a chair in botany at the Royal Pontifical University of Mexico and create the coun try's first botanical garden, product of the new taxonomic philosophy initiated in Europe several decades earlier by Carolus Linnaeus. In October 1786, Charles III of Spain decreed "that the Spanish do minions in the southern Americas be explored and that the study of plants and their applications be fomented in Mexico." Anxious to get the inventory and cataloguing of natural specimens under way, the king delegated the project's organization to Casimiro Gómez Ortega, director of the Madrid Royal Botanical Garden, who in turn commissioned Martín de Sessé to lead the Mexican expedition, ac companied by two pharmacologists, Juan del Castillo and Jaime Sen seve, botanist Vicente Cervantes and the naturalist, surgeon and skilled anatomist, José Longinos Martinez. Besides the economic profit to be gained from the exploitation of natural resources such as spices and hardwood, the Bourbon monar chy was also interested in discovering their medicinal properties. In the mid-seventeenth century, the ports of Spain and America were opened for international trade and the Bourbons began pro moting expeditions of different kinds to their overseas colonies. These included Malaspina's Scientific Expedition around the world, the New Granada Botanical Expedition under the leadership of eminent botanist Celestino Mutis, Hipólito Ruiz and José Antonio O - Pavón's expedition through Chile and Peru, and among the most important, the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Spain. Such was the panorama of royal expeditionary interests at the time. Mexico, meanwhile, was on the verge of forming its independence movement, and the criollo and mestizo intelligentsia was busy con structing cultural circles around notable personages including José \ 87 i rf</page><page sequence="8">ÚMi Antonio de Alzate y Ramírez, a science writer and member of the Academy of Sciences in Paris who had sparked passionate contro versy for his role in laying the foundations for the rational sciences in Mexico, as well as opposing the new Linnaean philosophy. While in exile in Italy, Francisco Javier Clavijero published his historic es say in defense of Mesoamerican cultures. The physician and jour nalist José Ignacio de Bartolache published the journal El Mercurio Volante, which focused on the scientific and technical advances of the time. As for Joaquín Velázquez de León, he was at the heart of many a heated debate and published papers on astronomy and math ematics. These scholars stood out from among a plethora of scien tists, inventors and artists, gaining recognition for the relevance of their work on the Americas at that time. In other parts of the world, the Enlightenment was confronted with alternative streams of thought. It was a turbulent period of transi tion which, decades later, would spark certain reforms in the over seas colonies. In genteel artistic, social and scientific circles, the physiognomy of a nascent nation was being determined. Amid the prolonged death throes of a millennium-old tradition—of an unknown origin and destiny, and marked by its denial of the Other—the Church imposed the tenets of the Catholic faith by means of a sword concealed be hind a cross. The freedom to travel overseas was restricted to a small segment of the population belonging to the affluent classes. While social discontent slowly germinated, rationalism sprang from within the confines of industrialization and "the ordering of the world" to sweep across Europe. In America, there were those who suffered from historical trauma and corruption—encouraged by the distance from the imperial metropolis—among encomenderos (feudal-style landlords) and the empowered bureaucracy, while others enjoyed the pleasures of life amid an unsullied geography new to European eyes and canvases and witnessed the spread of "Castilian", a language ex pressed not without caution and restraint under the ever watchful inquisitorial eye. Thus, the Enlightenment in Mexico underwent a distinct histori cal process from that of France and the concept of universal hu man rights, that of Anglican Protestantism or that of Germanic cul ture's vigor, force and clarity (die Aufklarung). Here it took a different course through other imaginary turbulent waters that were also for eign to the Iberian Peninsula. THE ILLUSTRATOR. This naturalistic venture was the colonial pe riod's longest scientific expedition through the Americas, reaching Nootka Sound (on the west coast of what is now Canada) by sea, traveling overland from San Francisco, California, to Costa Rica and then setting sail for the Caribbean islands. Two individuals in par ticular stand out for their scientific and artistic contributions: José Mariano Mociño y Lozada, a native of Temascaltepec in the present day state of México, and Atanasio Echeverría, who at an early age began drawing the first botanical samples collected in the environs of Mexico City—to the amazement of professors and foreigners. Although no reliable documentary evidence remains concerning the character, passions or artistic interests of Atanasio Echeverría, born in 1772 at the height of the Enlightenment, Sessé does provide an indirect impression in a letter to Gómez Ortega written seven months into the initial exploration of the Valley of Mexico: Vi cente de la Cerda and Echeverría "are both talented men," he wrote, "but the latter greatly outshines the former [...] As a sample of this young man's great ability (though he is not yet fifteen), 1 submit to you a drawing done so deftly and so rapidly that in a single day he completed four plants and a butterfly which looks as if it wants to fly off the page." Besides recognizing Echeverria's artistic ability, Sessé also pointed out his integrity and dedication to his work, which led him to predict a state of "uninterrupted peace throughout the expedition." Indeed, this young man—who had no formal preparation other than an eight-month course taken to comply with the require ments of the recently established Academy of San Carlos—pos sessed the freedom and freshness to appreciate the universe of plants, animals and geographic features they were to encounter during this fascinating adventure, and to record it following the conven tions of scientific illustration. For his youth and isolation from other artistic milieux, his work could well be considered naive, but his genius was confirmed during the trek across California with Mo ciño, and more notably on Nootka Island, where he captured beau tiful settings, landscapes and vistas, as well as local customs. Botanical and zoological illustration gave little free rein to the imag ination; subjects could not be chosen at will and works generally went unsigned. Nevertheless, artists frequently had a better percep tion of the natural world than did botanists—particularly in Eche verria's case. Thanks to their detailed watercolors, it is now possible to differentiate classes and species of plants previously unidenti fied by taxonomists. The naturalists were accompanied on these expeditions by artists taking notes and making hasty sketches of specimens. Part of their task was to indicate intensity of color, leaf characteristics, stalk size, quantity of seeds produced and the temperature of the plant in flower; and in the case of bird and animal species, their range, beak shape, density of plumage, skin texture and differentiation in re productive organs. Scientific standards required that illustrations be done to scale "to show the true measurements, and including indications as to the color," and that "nature should be copied accurately, never presum ing to correct or embellish it as some illustrators do, appealing to their imagination to elaborate upon the specimen's true form." Still, these artists freely applied their talents to transposing the beauty of life to paper, re-creating it in just a few colors and brushstrokes. By incorporating Linnaean taxonomy into scientific illustration, the expedition's artists pioneered a style unlike anything produced by their indigenous and Spanish predecessors, recording the char acteristics as well as the beauty of Mexican plants. They were the forerunners to the new conventions of scientific illustration which would thenceforth prevail in botany and zoology, and the natural sciences in general. Echeverria's work is particularly noteworthy, displaying a mastery without precedent in the field. His paintings differ from earlier works such as those of Juan Navarro's Historia nat ural or Jarán americano (1801), certain illustrations salvaged from Fran cisco Hernández's body of work (1576), part of Bernardino de Saha gún's Historia general de las cosas de Nueva España (General History of the Things of New Spain, 1560-1590), the sketches of Martín de la Cruz—a tepatiani (herbalist) and author of the Codex Badianus (1552)—and indeed, the iconography of Mesoamerican codices in general. His work even preceded that of Humboldt, Bonpland and Kunth—chronologically, if not in publication. This flora is revolutionary for anyone able to appreciate its value in terms of beauty, artistic skill, scientific precision—for example, the inclusion of the species' reproductive organs to one side of the draw ing so as to facilitate the identification of the corresponding taxon— and for the early stage at which it was produced. However, contrary to what some researchers have claimed, none of this was recog nized at the time, as only a handful of specialists had access to the drawings. Written and graphic testimonies (the exquisite plates of New Gra nada's flora executed during the expedition led by Celestino Mutis, based in Bogotá, Colombia, or the ones from Malaspina's expedi tion, for example) demonstrate that Echeverria's artistry—or that of De la Cerda and his colleagues, for that matter—was compara ble to that of his American and European contemporaries. His skill was acknowledged by eminent scholars such as Augustin Pyr 88</page><page sequence="9">amus de Candolle—one of the greatest authorities on European botanical drawing and the founder of Swiss botany, living in Paris at the time—who saw the original drawings during Mociño's pil grimage to the Old World in search of someone with an apprecia tion for the most important collection of Mexican plants produced in the eighteenth century. THE NATURALIST. With a temperament that more than likely cor responded to the fiery climate of his birthplace, Mociño was the first modern botanist in Mexico and yet another of our unsung heroes of science. As a naturalist and a pioneer in Mexican botany, taxon omy, medicine, vulcanology, geography, anthropology and folk art, his name was placed alongside that of the leader of this enterprise dubbed either the Mociño-Sessé Expedition or the Sessé-Mociño Expedition, depending on whether one is in Mexico or in Spain. A Bachelor of Philosophy among the first generation of students (Nemine Discrepante) to graduate from the new department of bot any and hired in 1790 as a collaborator in the expedition, Mociño embraced the new movement in scientific illustration promoted by the recently arrived Spanish disciples of Linnaeus, and devoted his life to this adventure, despite certain ugly disputes over salary and his status in the expedition. At a little over thirty years of age, Mociño became one of the team's official botanists in 1793, and par ticipated in the explorations for almost sixteen years. He is consid ered one of the first Mexican scientists to display a keen awareness of the need to document the country's natural and cultural wealth. Mociño made one of his most important anthropological and ethno graphic contributions when he was commissioned, along with Ata nasio Echeverría, to trace the northern limits of the territories of New Spain (which at one point extended as far as present-day British Columbia). His study of Nootka Island, Noticias de Nutka, describes aboriginal customs, religion, language, music, poetry, hunting tech niques and forms of government, and contains copious notes and studies on social and natural history. During this journey both men came into contact with scientists and artists from Malaspina's expe dition. By the time Alexander von Humboldt arrived in Mexico, the explorations had been in progress for over a decade and had gained recognition on both sides of the Atlantic for the magnitude of the project and the quality of the illustrations. As the first scientists and artists to apply Linnsean taxonomy in Mexico, the scope of their undertaking is evident in the more than 8000 specimens collected, over a thousand of which were new to European scientists. With the assistance of students from the Acad emy of San Carlos, over 2000 illustrations were done of plants, ani mals, insects and fish. Spain was the beneficiary of the first Mexi can plants to reach Europe, including the genera Dahlia, Cosmos and Zinnia, which in cultivation have produced countless spectac ular varieties that today enhance gardens throughout the conti nent. During the following generations, seeds propagated in Madrid were distributed to the principal gardens of Europe, changing the face of Old World horticulture forever. Today, two centuries after the expedition was realized, this scien tific and artistic magnum opus has yet to be published—a great loss to Mexican natural history. The only attempts at salvaging some thing of value from that enterprise were Plantas Novae Hispana and Flora mexicana, published between 1887 and 1894 by the Mexican Natural History Society. But neither of these two works compare to the original concept envisioned by the authors. Indeed, after thirty years of research, botanist Roger MacVaugh postulated that "had Flore du Mexique been published as planned, it would now be con sidered a key study of neotropical botany, preceding such monu mental works as Humboldt, Bonpland and Kunth's Nova Genera et Species Plantorum Americanorum." In this same issue of Artes de México, Augustin Pyramus de Candolle recounts aspects of this dramatic odyssey, which has still not drawn to a close: botanists from around the world have documented inci dents of unscrupulous behavior and outright theft on the part of Mociño's colleagues—Ruiz and Pavón, to be specific. On learning that Mociño had been imprisoned, unjustly accused of commiser ation with the French army during the invasion of Madrid in the early nineteenth century, they sold copies of the herbarium to di verse collectors at less than their real value. Today, most of this material has been scattered among various in stitutions (most of them official) in Europe and the United States. &amp; Translated by Richard Moszka and Charlotte Broad.

Burdet The library of the Botanical Conservatory and Garden of Geneva has in its keeping a document that is both curious and remarkable. It is a set of thirteen thick volumes bound in red morocco leather, containing sketches of plants rendered partially or entirely in uiatercolors. The first volume bears the handwritten title Flore du Mexique. It includes an introduction, a catalogue of illustrations, an alphabetical list of Mex ican floral genera and a list of the artists who copied the original illustra tions. This unusual collection—popularly known as "Flora of the Ladies of Geneva"—is a scientific document of prime importance, particularly fen- the study of Mexican plants. It is a priceless one-of-a-kind manuscript, a moving account of the scarcely believable misfortunes, hardships and disappointments suffered by a group of brave explorers in the eighteenth century, and also evidence of the civic spirit and interest in science dis played by the people of Geneva in the nineteenth century. The story of the Spanish scientific expedition to Mexico known as the Royal Botanical Expedition (1787-1803) has been recounted many times. Less widely known are the trials and tribulations to which its members were submitted following their return to Spain during the troubled times when control of the Spanish Crown was being disputed by the Bonapartes and the Bourbons while rebellion was fermenting in Spain's colonial empire. For reasons that are the subject of ongoing historical and scientific inves tigation, the brilliant results of this expedition have for the most part remained under wraps, or were divulged only partially and belatedly. How was it that Geneva, the weakest of colonial and maritime world pow ers, became the final port-of-call for a prestigious scientific expedition to Spain's overseas possessions? What role did the ladies of Geneva play in this affair? What was at stake for the botanical sciences in that series of exotic, fabulous and at times tragic episodes? As one of the key players in this epic, Augustin Pyramus de Candolle was witness to many of the acts and circumstances and well-situated so as to appreciate their meaning or import. He was in Montpellier when Spanish partisans of the defeated Bonapartes took refuge there in ¡813, and was among those who endeavored to aid exiled scholars. Four years later in Geneva, it was he who inspired the ladies of that city to take up pencils, pens and brushes in the name of science. And it was thanks to him that some of the expedition's results finally entered the realm of published bot anical knowledge. Not only did De Candolle play an important part in the adventure but in 1819, once the curtain had fallen on the last act, he also took the trouble to recount what he knew about the drama, what he had been told by its protagonists and the incidents he had witnessed directly. The text we transcribe here—which De Candolle dictated and had placed at the beginning of the first of the thirteen volumes conforming the Flore du Mexique—is by far the most direct and authentic account of the Royal Botanical Expedition available. Hervé M. Burdet Subdirector of the Botanical Conservatory and Garden of Geneva FLORE DU MEXIQUE Desiring to have the natural riches of his vast American posses sions explored, King Charles IV of Spain divided the territory into three parts and named a commission of naturalists to travel the length and breadth of each, reporting on the different things they observed, with special emphasis on the plant life. [In reality, it was Charles III who in 1786 ordered the realization of this expedition.] There is perhaps no other sovereign more deserving of the recog nition of scholars for his contribution to the advancement of the botanical sciences. However, unforeseen circumstances prevented these brilliant efforts from achieving their expected useful results. Hipólito Ruiz and José Antonio Pavón were assigned to explore the kingdoms of Peru and Chile. Joseph Dombey [a Montpellier physi cian] joined them in the noble enterprise, during which they gath ered an immense quantity of specimens, most of them little studied or entirely unknown. Dombey died on their return to Europe before he was able to publish their discoveries. He entrusted this task to Charles L'Héritier, Crown Attorney in charge of water and forests— himself taken by an early death stemming from the horrors of the revolution and thus unable to carry out his friend's wishes. More for tunate than him, Ruiz and Pavón initiated the publication of Flora Peruana et Chilensis: the first volume contains descriptions of new genera while the following three broach the task of describing species. But both men died before completing this important work, victims of the revolution in Spain. Around the same time, Celestino Mutis established a school of bot any and other natural sciences in Bogotá. There he trained painters and engravers, and devoted his life to studying the natural resources of that beautiful realm. Mutis had paintings or engravings made of all the specimens he observed and had he lived to a slightly older age, Europe would have been the recipient of an herbarium pro duced entirely in America (indeed, in a country it considered bar baric), whose excellence would have rivaled the finest works of its kind in the Old World. Mutis's death interrupted that noble enter prise, and his collected works have yet to be published—a project that was initiated many times only to be abandoned amid the wars and revolutions that racked America (though a handful of articles extracted from Mutis's research papers did appear in the Semanario of the kingdom of New Granada in 1813). Recently however, a sub stantial part of his collection, including many drawings, reached Spain; their publication has been entrusted to the enlightened and exacting care of Mariano Lagasca—a celebrated botany professor from Madrid. The third expedition, destined for Mexico (or for the entire king dom of New Spain, to be precise) was led by Martin de Sessé. Following fifteen years of difficult travel and laborious investigation, Sessé, accompanied by José Mariano Mociño, journeyed to Spain in 1803 with the intention of presenting the expedition's results and getting their publication under way. It is quite comprehensible that some extra time and effort was needed to complete such an immense work, which furthermore had been carried out so far from Europe and amid the constant unrest of travel. Many years elapsed while the nomenclature and descriptions of Mexican plants were revised and the drawings completed, engraved on plates and printed. Had these latter stages attained the same degree of perfection as the orig inal drawings, the work would have transcended all others of its kind. But this vast project failed as did its two predecessors, and for sim ilar reasons. All investigation was suspendéd in the wake of Sessé's death and Spain's revolutions and internal strife. Despite the trou bles and uncertainty faced by his administration shortly after as cending to the Spanish throne, Joseph Bonaparte took measures to encourage the completion of the project, of which Mociño was now the sole leader. Thus began the initiatives to accelerate the pub lication of Flore du Mexique. 90 Hervé M. Burdet</page><page sequence="11">However, in view of the fate that befell his military forces, Joseph Bonaparte was forced to quit Spain. Hasty orders were given to Mo ciño to pack up his drawings and manuscripts and follow the French army. Arriving in the southern French provinces after the battle of Vittoria, he and Francisco Antonio Zea [a Colombian botanist and Mutis's student] decided to seek refuge in Montpellier. I had met Zea in Paris on several occasions, and I knew Mociño by reputation, for his as yet unpublished work. I welcomed them as celebrated though unfortunate colleagues, and offered Mociño every means I had at my disposal to complete this important work. He showed me approx imately 1400 drawings of plants, nearly all of them unknown, and an equal number of drawings of animals—all executed with uncommon perfection. Given the situation in Spain, Zea knew it would be dif ficult to publish such an immense number of new laminae and urged Mociño to allow me to include descriptions of the plants he, Sessé and Cervantes had discovered in the Universal System of the Plant Kingdom [Regni Vegetabilis Systema Naturale] 1 was elaborating at the time. Mociño had realized that his nomenclature—established far from European libraries and herbaria—contained a great number of errors and thus quickly commiserated with the idea. He offered me his drawings and manuscripts on the condition that after the two of us had finished rectifying the nomenclature, I would include all the new species from the Flore du Mexique in my work along with their discoverers' names. But Mociño no longer had the manuscripts with the descriptions realized in situ in his possession: in the wake of Jo seph Bonaparte's disastrous retreat, they had been taken to Paris in a jumble of other documents. Zea eventually managed to locate them and forward them to me. Having thus become the sole depos itory of the manuscripts and drawings, I undertook a detailed exam ination of them, devoting about a year to that task. 1 never neglect ed to consult Mociño whenever 1 considered that his memories could help resolve the problems I encountered. But eleven years had gone by since his departure from Mexico, and during that time he had been more taken up with the description of animals than of plants. In addition, he had recently faced distressing hardships, at an ad vanced age when a man aspires only to rest. This had little by little effaced some of his memories and the vitality necessary to complete the project, and in most cases I had to rely solely on drawings and written descriptions. The descriptions 1 had in my possession were incomplete, perhaps because several volumes of them had been lost (as those that did reach me contained articles pertaining to drawings that were miss ing), or because the expeditionists had refrained from describing any specimen they believed was already known, or, finally, because the system of description adopted was insufficiently detailed. What I was able to extract from these manuscripts was a somewhat more ex plicit description of the organs of certain plants, some notes on their flowering season, as well as information on local uses, common names and the synonymies proposed by Francisco Hernández [a Spanish doctor who realized the largest scientific expedition to the Americas in the sixteenth century, from 1571 to 1577] in his Rerum medicarum Novae Hispaniae Thesaurus. This work was of utmost value to my studies. Before being informed of the existence of Flore du Mexique, it had seemed impossible to link Hernández's abbreviated descrip tions to any known species or even to a known genus in many cases. Indeed, it was difficult to fully confide in a work that presented so many unknown and extraordinary specimens. As such, one of the first results of my research was my greater regard for the Thesaurus, having discovered the means to link some of the species designat ed there with their respective genera. The common names of plants, I insist, proved to be of great use to me in this task, and I cannot overemphasize the importance of taking note of them on journeys to distant lands as a means of establishing communication between naturalists and the inhabitants of those countries, as well as with other travelers who, unversed in the language of science, resort to this popular nomenclature. Plant names in New Spain are almost invariably composed of diverse expressions describing their nature and appearance and as such can sound frightfully long to European ears. (Some examples Mociño gives of this are tomahvactlacopatli, coa patlisdatepequaquilco and iztacpaltitepuzcullula.) Such names pertain to three main dialects: true Mexican, spoken among the indigenous population of the Valley of Mexico and Tlascalla [Tlaxcala] region, which Hernández almost always used; the Otomi dialect, spoken among the indigenous population in the provinces of Valladolid [today Morelia], Querétaro and Zacatecas; and the Tarasca dialect of Sonora and Durango. [Early nineteenth-century geographic and eth nographic knowledge of Mexico was at best fragmentary, and De Candolle's attributions here are somewhat inaccurate.] To these must be added the names the Spaniards gave to the species they found in their new holdings, forming them either based on a com parison with European specimens or from indigenous names in a more or less altered state. The drawings done in Mexico contributed to facilitating the work. As I mentioned above, they were executed by a number of different painters and reveal a great disparity in artistic skill, but they all appear accurate in terms of general forms and even botanical details. This may be judged by the precision with which even the most minute features of their flowers and often of their fruit were depicted, and the ease with which most drawings could be linked to known families or genera. Indeed, with regard to those known species that were fortunately included in this col lection, it was possible to verify the drawings' accuracy by com paring them to published descriptions and plates of the same plants and frequently to living specimens, as in the case of the nasturtium and the sunflower, among others. I must say the drawings of plants common to Europe were of equal or greater value to me than those of new species, because they confirmed that I could regard the oth ers as true representations of existing specimens. Relating them to some of Hernández's drawings further supported this conclusion. I dwell on this point because lacking such confidence in the draw ings' veracity, all my work would be utterly useless. Some drawings bore names corresponding to the accompanying written descriptions or to Hernández's work, but most were unidentified. After examin ing them in detail, Mociño and I established their nomenclature based on the different specimens' characteristics and interrelation ships. Wherever possible we conserved the names originally adopt ed by the authors themselves, and when I found myself in the posi tion of having to either change a name or create a new one, it was always with Mociño's approval. The result of this study was a collec tion encompassing around 110 new genera and 1200 species unknown to modern naturalists—even though we had in our possession only a fraction of the drawings and descriptions gathered during the expe dition! The remainder had either been left in Madrid or had sadly gone astray during the war. Certainly, several of the genera or species we consider to be new may appear in Alexander von Humboldt's vast botanical work, which had not yet been published at the time of our research. As soon as I am able to familiarize myself with the Nova Genera et Species plan tarum Americanarum, I will hasten to compare Humboldt's proposed nomenclature to our own, and I will regard this concordance as yet another proof of the fidelity of the drawings composing the Flore du Mexique. Moreover, 1 showed the drawings of new genera to Hum boldt and his colleague Karl Kunth, and even they recognized very few of them as forming part of their collection. This fact gives an indication as to the prodigious number of species pertaining to this botanical region. But before speaking of Mexican vegetation, it is necessary to say a few more words as to the methods adopted in our work. The names assigned to genera that we believed to be new often differed from those imposed by the authors, as the original 91</page><page sequence="12">MMoraorn names had in the meantime been assigned to other genera. The first were selected with a view to honoring the memory of Mexicans who had rendered some service to science or played an important role in the history of Mexican civilization. Thus we dedicated the most visually stunning genus in the collection to the Emperor of Mexico, Montezuma (or as the Indians say, Moctezuma), famed for his luxuriant gardens. Thus, too, Mociño wished to consecrate the names of Juan de Palafox y Mendoza, one of the first bishops in volved in the reformation of Mexico and founder of the University of Mexico; Antonio Maria Cobarrubias, Pablo de la Llave, Juan Pa lacios de la Campa, Ignacio León y Pérez, Luis Montaña y Ríos and Andrés Manuel del Río—all distinguished amateur botanists and in many cases, friends of the authors—as well as of the viceroy Miguel José de Azanza and the vicereine Alegría [protectors and patrons of Mociño's botanical expedition to Nootka, during which he encoun tered the celebrated traveler Vancouver]. Finally, Mociño wished to honor Echeverría and De la Cerda, two artists forming part of the ex pedition to New Spain. Once these names so dear to the authors of Flore du Mexique had been duly consecrated in the annals of science, we designated the remaining genera according to their characteristics, using mytho logical allusions or dedicating them to botanists deserving of such a distinction, as was the usual practice. When the study of Mexican genera was complete, I had their gener ic traits meticulously copied—with Mociño's approval—respecting the method used in the works of Charles Plumier [a French mis sionary, explorer and botanist who executed 6000 remarkable draw ings of American plants] and Johann Reinhold Forster [a German explorer and botanist]. My plan had been to publish simple line drawings and descriptions of the genera discovered by Sessé and Mociño as a way of fomenting public awareness as to the scope and relevance of their research. The copies realized by Node-Véran, a talented artist and engraver from the Montpellier botanical gar den, give a very accurate idea of the original drawings. This project was interrupted by a number of circumstances and left incomplete. I will perhaps resume work on it one day, if Mociño does not publish Flore de Mexique himself. The determination of species has required more time but has pre sented fewer difficulties. I should mention that I was assisted in this task by Michel Félix Dunal and Jules Cloquet, two doctors of med icine known for their important research. Independently of the spe cies documented here, Mociño permitted Dunal to include in his monographs of Solanaceae and Annonaceae all the related species from his collection. He conceded the Genevan doctor Louis Colla don similar permission for the canafistula species. As a rule, Mociño always sought—in a completely disinterested manner—to create a collection that would be of utility to science. It was in this spirit that, at the time of my departure from Mont pellier, Mociño gave me a precious token of his esteem and friend ship. I had wanted to return the drawings, which had been in my possession for two years, but he refused to take them back. "No," he told me, "I'm too old, too ill, too wretched to ever put them to good use in the field of botany. Take them to Geneva. I place them in your care, along with my future scientific glory." I received this priceless collection as a symbol of this excellent individual's friendship, and took it upon myself to someday make his important research pub lic. I returned to Geneva with the drawings in the fall of 1816 and stored them for more than six months. Meanwhile, the acrimony that had long kept Mociño exiled from Spain was gradually mitigated. A more generous spirit took over from such harsh measures, and this dignified old man, faced with the likelihood of dying on foreign soil after devoting his life to use ful works, was finally summoned back to his own country. He found friends among persons of political convictions that ran counter to his own, and I am pleased to report that even when the persecution of Spanish partisans of Joseph Bonaparte was at its height, Lagasca —head of the Botanical Garden of Madrid, who throughout the war had borne arms in defense of Ferdinand VII's cause—proclaimed his esteem for Mociño by dedicating a plant genus to him on the same page as one dedicated to Prince Ferdinand. Having resolved to go back to Spain, Mociño was unwilling to leave the drawings behind. In April 1817, he wrote to request their return; in view of his scheduled date of departure, there were few days remaining be fore I would have to turn them over to him. [Mociño recovered his valuable collection in time and set out for Spain.] I regretted losing forever the opportunity of studying this beautiful work and wished to conserve at least some treatises on the princi ple plants forming the collection. To that end, I appealed to cer tain individuals who had already copied some of the plants as a drawing exercise. I would have considered myself lucky to obtain copies of even twenty illustrations, but what was my surprise and gratitude to observe the kindliest and most energetic reaction among the artists and amateurs of our city, eager to conserve in our midst copies of as many of the drawings as possible from the Mexican collection. Not only those who had some kind of association with me, but even people I had never had the pleasure of meeting came forward with uncommon enthusiasm to offer to lend a hand with pencils and paintbrushes. More than a hundred people (108 known to me, not counting the 46 drawings made by anonymous individuals), all driven by the same fervor, set to work simultaneously. Beginners traced the out lines, amateurs colored them one by one, and trained artists saw to the more difficult specimens. Drawing professors supervised their students' work while those who did not know how to paint tried to be helpful by seeking out other possible collaborators among their acquaintances. The enterprise rapidly took on almost national dimensions, with so many willing souls joining forces in its realization, displaying a solidarity only to be found in such a republic as this, where we are all like a single family. Thanks to our city's multitude of undiscov ered talents ensconced in every level of society and to the remark able goodwill that the people of Geneva were so quick to demon strate, I obtained astounding results: in under a week, the outlines of 860 drawings had been traced in every detail, and were more or less complete with regard to color, while another 119 had been con served in the form of sketches. To this collection I added another 71 drawings which I had had time to get copied in Montpellier, and 305 duplicates that Mociño was kind enough to leave with me. In the end, there were only 98 drawings from the Mexican collection of which I conserved no copy; however, the species already known to botanists were included in this number; consequently the real deficit is smaller than it may seem. In this manner I assembled a new collection of approximately 1300 drawings of varying quality but adequate for the purposes of study, and holding for me a charm beyond measure. It was particularly the ladies who displayed that degree of talent and enthusiasm to which I have referred, and I beg they accept this heartfelt expression of my gratitude, which I also extend to every person who participated in this undertaking. The illustrations were methodically ordered in the thirteen volumes forming the Flore du Mexique, whose introduction I compose here. I will cherish this collection as a precious token of the goodwill and public-spiritedness that characterize our nation. It is also my in tention to take measures so that when I am gone this opus will re main in Geneva for all time, not only as a permanent teaching tool for botanists, but also serving for the advancement of the arts, especially drawing, and as an inspiration to our community spirit.

They are ephemeral crea tures, displaced in time, and arouse an interest—first on the can vas and then in blissful spectators' imaginations—stemming partly from their meanings hidden to the uninitiated eye. Their fragrance is that of eternity. Flowers have always been a fundamental aspect of human culture. They have been present in artistic creation from cave painting to the contemporary visual arts. Greco-Roman, Medieval and Renaissance literature immortalized their names, applications and symbolic sig nificance, and artists captured those same elements in paint. The pharmacopoeia of alchemy, the emblems of European royal houses, Arcimboldo's astrological botany and other esoteric schools left a legacy of paintings, illustrated texts and assorted works about flow ers, which were notably enriched by contributions from the Amer icas, following the Spanish Conquest. During the colonial period, the irises, gladiolas and lilies of Christian offerings were transposed onto canvas and given a pious and mys tical tone. During the posterior boom in baroque art, the purity of saints, martyrs, angels, Christ and the Virgin was depicted with the obligatory luminous white flowers placed against the gloomy back grounds of tenebrism. During the eighteenth century, Miguel Cab rera's Cristo en el jardín de las delicias (Christ in the Garden of De lights) placed the Messiah upon a bed of flowers of different species, each labeled with its allegorical meaning. Since its creation during an era of strained relations between the sensuality of forms and the wrath of God, the painting has always had an enormous impact. It presents an alternative Prince of Flowers, master of transcenden tal botany, reunited with God the Father in the Garden of Eden, Christ resurrected, victorious, wearing the mantle of nobility, in a state of tranquil contemplation—and recalls not only the paradise of Tláloc but also its antipodes: the gardens of an ecstatic Buddha and Krishna's magnificent surroundings. The garden is universal. Christ reclines on a bed of flowers and thus crowns the effort of reaching the heart of immortal inner truth. From the same era we cannot forget the ayate (maguey-fiber cloth) in which Juan Diego gathered the roses that the Virgin of Guadalupe caused to bloom on the Cerro de Tepeyac. The miraculous appearance of her image on the cloth captivated the religious sentiment of natives and for eigners alike, and the gaze of all appreciators of art. Later, in Romantic painting, the marigold, the arboreal bloom of the agave and the maguey—that strange stelliform flower with potent fermented sap—were all included as subject matter in a desire to vindicate the indigenous cultures which the Academy exalted with particular virtuosity, ingenuously transporting that world to an idyllic plane beyond the realms of logic. Flowers were also masterfully represented in the botanical water colors of our most famous landscape painter, José María Velasco and during the twentieth century, in the exhaustive ceuvre of Helen O'Gorman. Joaquin Claussel's studio walls and canvases depict a lush Mexican landscape with Impressionistic influences. In con trast, there is the case of Juan Tablada, an "exotic" poet whose water colors create a lovely Oriental naturalism where squash blossoms and the black efflorescence of the huitlacoche fungus illustrate a whole menu of culinary delights to satisfy not only the appetite but also the most exacting gaze. In a different format, the murals at the National Palace and La Raza Hospital (both in Mexico City) are the result of a wide-ranging aes thetic exploration of pre-Hispanic flora and its use in medicine, food and trade. Calla lilies, fresh and white as snow, are carried on the backs of mythical dark-skinned women while flower tattoos adorn the bodies of more worldly women. Suns are painted like astral chrysanthemums in the Siqueiros Cultural Polyforum, and flowering cacti are transformed into dancing deer in yarn-paintings fixed in place with wax, as in an astral map of expeditions through lands where strange flowers dream and converse in the millenary tongue of the Huichol Indians. Flowers symbolize the atemporal beauty of form and the inexorable mystery of time, our ephemeral life on Earth and our participation in eternity. Flowers bring joy and extend sympathies; they reconcile and seduce, and speak for both guests and their hosts. A flower is the best way to compliment a woman whose beauty outshines it, and accompanies her in portraits as an almost obligatory compositional element, while placing their own significance in relief. They are a metaphor for feminine charms and have certain virtues attributed to them: the white rose of friendship and virginal purity, the red rose of passion, the yellow rose that humbly implores forgiveness and reconciliation; birds-of-paradise pay homage to the imagination and intelligence. The possibilities are infinite, and depend solely upon the sensual creativity of the person who designs the bouquet and determines the model's pose. For centuries, nudes have been depicted with flowers, presenting a great challenge and enormous pleasure for painters. We are the beneficiaries of their talent. The twentieth century seems to have begun by discarding flowers and ended by recognizing them as an essential theme in the face of ultranationalist and fundamentalist barbarities. In revolution ary Mexico (the decade of 1910) they were conspicuous for their ab sence, having been displaced by historical and ideological circum stances. The time was not ripe for painting flowers, and they were certainly never placed on the common graves of those killed in the conflict. However, perhaps as a consequence, they did become the mandatory subject matter of private academies and the domestic practice of amateur or commercial painters. "I find this whole aca demic-political-touristic business truly disgusting," complained José Clemente Orozco, while David Alfaro Siqueiros cursed, "This ill ness we've called Mexican Curious manifestly initiated the debili tation of Mexican painting on the whole." Nevertheless, various art ists dared to paint flowers in the context of a new pictorial space, and artisans from every region of the country continue to render them in glass, palm leaves, copper, brass, gold and silver. The flow ers that Diego Rivera painted on a Lerma River fountain (since re stored and left dry) were eventually dissolved by water and swal lowed up by the city. Rufino Tamayo molded flowers out of cosmic iron crystals which refracted distant rays of light, coloring the way the century viewed the world. In Siqueiros's paintings, enormous flowers explode like new stars, harbingers of expressive and political freedom, and Orozco transformed them into the flames of a destruc tive Prometheus-like irony. Frida Kahlo also made flowers sprout in her bath, bedroom and studio. Dressed in the typical costume of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, she herself was a strange blossom with a large white corolla, bringing to mind another Tehuana—Saturnino Herrán's full-body portrait of a seated woman with a despondent and dreamy air. Throughout the twentieth century, many painters have incorporat ed flowers into their work, either as the central subject or to create the context of a piece. Leonora Carrington's mysterious botanical creations are unforgettable, submerged in a dreamlike atmosphere where only mist seems to thrive. Remedios Varo placed flowers in various settings. In La planta insumisa (The Unsubmissive Plant) an odd figure with hair that grows in sequences of mathematical and chemical formulas extracts the floral quintessence in a magical lab Pedro Schneider</page><page sequence="14">oratory. In La música solar (Solar Music), a musician plays luminous rays of sunlight like the strings of some strange instrument, caus ing a flower to grow in the midst of a gloomy forest. And finally, the flower in Descubrimiento de un geólogo muíante (The Discovery of a Mutant Geologist) is observed through a telescope as if it were an unknown planet. María Izquierdo transports us not to dreams but to their recollection, the image of a strange event that fades in the memory like the flowers withering in her dramatic and intimate canvases. Ricardo Martínez creates a mimesis between women and flowering cacti, both hurled into the desert of the soul. He also discovers a metaphysical proposal in the magic of a vase holding a single flower set upon a windowsill, and envisions a sheaf of wheat in efflorescence as a radiant offering in the hands of a primordial woman. Arturo Rivera offers us his head on a silver platter, a force ful self-portrait in which the empty gaze of the decapitated artist appears to have been riveted in the final moment of life by the beau ty of a flower descending from the upper limits of the composition —as John the Baptist perhaps glimpsed his cruel executioner Salomé before dying. At once severe and extravagant, Rivera's work dis plays the grace of a Renaissance painter and the eye of a twenti eth-century poet as he offers himself in sacrifice to the voluptuous art of painting. The 1960s were marked by the initiation of a radical social transfor mation which was reflected in creative production, above all in the visual arts and literature. Curiously enough, in Mexico—the Mecca of psychotropic plants—psychedelic painting never found the seri ous following it had in Anglo-Saxon countries, where les fleurs du mal inundated the world of clean living with their exotic, tantalizing fra grances. Flower children and five-pointed leaves permeated the en tire era, and some painters began to contemplate and copy nature with their pupils and minds dilated by natural and chemical sub stances. "The poet is a copyist who prefers to make copies in a state of ecstasy," wrote José Lezama Lima. Landscapes produced by the younger generation of painters from Oaxaca—many of them students of Francisco Toledo, the witch doctor of Juchitán—display a metaphysical luminosity, emanating an aura similar to that given off by a flower's corolla bathed in sun light. In urban settings, conflicts with the economic and political en vironment lead artists to re-create the present in an intense, tragic and anti-conventional manner. Abstract painting and Tachism tried to establish a distance between flowers and art, but even there we find colors and textures strangely reminiscent of that undesirable theme. Taking a leaf from Leonardo da Vinci's book, flowers emerge from walls inadvertently, accidentally, painted in salt stains, rust and other natural media. More accessible to rational minds, gouaches, palette knives, brushstrokes and an infinite synthetic surfaces re create the lilac's transparency and the rose's inevitable thorn, which appear and disappear at will. There are also meadows constructed with screws and scrap materials: virtual flowers. Manuel Felguérez's abstract paintings challenge non-associative thought, but memory plays tricks on us. A wildflower blooms next to an imposing indus trial plant: the eternal quality of nature. Rather than flowers and their erotic and expressive connotations, however, many artists have opted for painting personal impressions of the city as a way of pos sessing and inhabiting it. They paint real walls to transform them into aesthetic fictions: urban flowers. It is never too late to let flow ers fill our eyes and our brushes once again, to intoxicate ourselves with their shapes and colors, to give them new meaning. Every painting is a flower of the gaze. Every gaze, a thought. Today, having left the Aztec wars of flowers and Mao's hundred flowers in the past, we cultivate the holistic efflorescence of planetary democ racy and paint all its possible aesthetic variations. In art, one flower is all flowers, an archetype of beauty. A branch is synonymous with the conjunction of different types of beauty. Men and women freely place their moral beauty at the service of others. Lovers unite their inner and outer beauty like poppy stems intertwining in a vase, their petals contrasting with the blue of the sky. From the tropical jungle of Bali to mesquite-inhabited deserts, from the tulips of Europe's par liamentary monarchies to the simple daisy of direct representation in Chiapas, every floral painting is an aesthetic and political vin dication of life. Art is the answer to the flower's fleeting existence: it never withers. áÁ. Translated by Richard Moszka and Michelle Suderman. IMAGINARY REVELATION Flowers: The Sen&amp;ual Mirror ojj Contemporary Painting Sylvia Navarrete The natural world has traditionally been a preferred theme in Western painting. Though religious iconography long held Mexican artists in its grip, the nineteenth century witnessed a boom in landscape painting and scientific and decorative illus tration of local flora. During the first half of the twentieth centu ry, these genres helped regain a sense of national values in the col lective consciousness. Today, the artistic depiction of flowers and plants has produced a fairly diverse repertory of images and forms of representation. It may be that landscapes and still lifes have fallen by the wayside but it is also true that plant life as a decon textualized element has become a metaphor for our own inner sensory dimension, as well as a symbol of existential doubts regard ing the body and identity. In the realm of painting and non-repre sentational art, most if not all contemporary artists have made use of floral motifs at some point, though only a handful have adopted them as a lasting visual code. It is this last group that interests us here. Still-life painting today has a scarce following. One of its most stead fast supporters is Pedro Diego Alvarado (b. 1956), who has been un wavering (but one wonders for how much longer) in his devotion to orthodox Mexican traditions, continuing to handle composition in a conventional manner with themes drawn from his native soil and a luminous, festive palette of colors. Alvarado chose flowers as his subject matter from the outset, drawing from nature as an exercise while learning his craft. This naturalistic tendency persists in his work to this day, perhaps out of inertia on his part but also due to a superb technical mastery which allows him to play, if not with form, then with effects of light and color. His balanced and stolidly ordered compositions of flowers, fruits and objects arranged on a table are im maculately rendered so as to achieve the velvety texture of marigolds and squash blossoms or the smooth skin of a mango. Their juxtaposi tion on canvas creates intense combinations of red, purple, indigo, chartreuse and lime green, lending magic to these somewhat ana chronic yet lush paintings, still prized by collectors. They are a far cry from the milky fruits and plants—"sweaty and lubricious," as Cuban poet Orlando González Esteva might have called them in his book Cuerpos en bandeja (A Carnal Platter, illustrated by Ramón Ale jandro, Artes de México/CNCA, 1998)—which abounded in the dan gerously anthropomorphic still lifes produced by Manuel González Serrano (b. 1917, d. I960) in the 1950s. We cannot fail to mention this painter from Jalisco for his unnerving audacity in a genre that may sometimes seem banal or even insipid. On another front, Elena Climent (b. 1955),captures the spontaneous simplicity of row-house balconies lined with plants potted in re cycled motor-oil and Coca-Cola cans, or the warmth of a diminutive altar set in a mechanic's shop or a corner store. Raquel Tibol states that this "detailed compendium of objects, systematically collected with sincere fondness for a certain aesthetic sensibility that is ex tensively shared among underprivileged Mexicans" re-creates—with 94 Sylvia Navarrete</page><page sequence="15">MMOiaAlKI a photographic memory and a certain nostalgia—glimmers of pro vincial life in the big city. An apotheosis of plant life is what is staged in the paintings of Maria Sada (b. 1954) and Luis Argudin (b. 1955). Each offers an indi vidual interpretation of the tropical landscape of mangroves and jun gles that characterizes their vision. Sada does so by basing her work on photographs, lending uncanny precision to her large-format oil paintings and "superimposing landscapes with geometric frames that allow her to play arbitrarily with expansive views while at once paying attention to detail," observes critic Luis Martín Lozano. How can one not feel enraptured before such frenzied brushwork at tempting to depict the immensity of foliage and luring our gaze to penetrate a calm and suffocating space of incredible verdancy and realness? Luis Argudin's recent oil paintings may appear less "ex cessive" perhaps because the central figure is the female nude. Here the exotic landscape functions as a background resolved in two con tradictory fashions: using a palette overloaded with brilliant tones of green or else relying solely on a monochromatic scale of grays. Though we may first perceive the mass of reeds, trees and brush wood much like wallpaper, these fields of "no-color and shadow of color" (as Argudin describes them) strive "to use the traces of paint" to punctuate the nude figure and its bodily imprint. Flowers and plants become an intimate diary in the work of Magali Lara (b. 1956). Her early works projected states of mind using a veg etation with a capricious will of its own in the space of an empty bedroom. Later, her paintings grew in size to unleash a prolifera tion of riotous vegetation. Then the artist returned to fragile lines and the synthesis of organic forms in an introspective process that took the female body—especially the reproductive organs—as well as sprouts, roots and trunks, as metaphors for inner states combin ing violence, pleasure, melancholy and eroticism. Marisa Boullosa (b. 1961) produces oil paintings and prints in this same intimist vein, with mangled flowers and broken toys (dolls, rattles and cup-and ball toys) reflecting the longing for lost innocence. In the 1980s, Rocío Maldonado (b. 1951) began making ink drawings on large irregular sheets of rice paper. These pieces possess the deli cate refinement of Japanese calligraphy and recall illustrations from old botanical treatises. Diaphanous lines of black ink with gray auras form superimposed rows of leaves, shells and starfish to evoke an or ganic subterranean world where fleshy leaves and blossoms reach to ward gossamer skies. Maldonado usually draws from nature but pre fers to imagine underground strata, root and rock formations instead of rendering the plants in her immediate environment. The ephemeral and vulnerable flora of Estela Hussong (b. 1950) bears a certain likeness to Maldonado's work, especially her drawings on paper—so much so that both artists participated along with Geor gina Quintana in an exhibition at the OMR Gallery in 1985. But Hus song has even more in common with Magali Lara, from whom she inherits the withdrawn ambiance and similarities in composition. Hussong's drawing is deliberately awkward, the lines sometimes even shaky. This nervous ambiguity of roots, stems and leaf veins is un derscored by labyrinthine structures, random proportions and con trasting color planes. The quivering line—almost graffiti-like in her early work—gradually lost its scribbly appearance as contours ac quired firmness. The space is saturated with signs and, as in Fauvism, blues, purples, reds and ochers delimit motifs and order them on the canvas. Hussong's work experienced an interesting upsurge in the 1980s and its absence is regrettably conspicuous in the present decade. Regarding the work of painter and installation artist Teresa Serrano (b. 1936), her early drawings included flowers and birds alluding to sexual and spiritual issues rather than to female virtues. Artists— especially women—frequently stress the relationship between the plant kingdom and biological, morphological and psychological as pects of femininity. Flowers and plants are identified with specific female anatomical features (the calla lily transformed into a vulva, for instance) but also with other elements that correspond to the realm of sensation and emotion. The work of painter and installation artist Betsabée Romero (b. 1963) manifests an obsession for flowers, particularly roses. It exhibits a twofold concern for the environment and aesthetics, focusing on our surroundings' state of devastation and on landscape painting as a bankrupt genre. Romero paints vistas of the Valley of Mexico to which she adds folk and sacred emblems (a figure of Our Lady of the Lakes, angels, milagros), architectural details of sixteenth-century convents, Pop Art icons and household items. "As a symbol of love traditionally associated with youth and beauty," explains the artist, "[the rose] led me to meditate on the need to reconstruct and rein terpret the symbols of the discourse of love." Her work speaks mainly of the body and by extension, of the desire for motherhood in the form of a subtle dialogue between daily life and the sublime. Nature is also sometimes a pretext for a quest to liberate the form. This is obviously the case of Isabel Leñero (b. 1962) and to a lesser ex tent Mauricio Sandoval (b. I960) and Roberto Turnbull (b. 1959). Le ñero began by depicting natural phenomena (whirlwinds, fires, tun nels through the undergrowth, marshes) and has lately been painting huge majestic flowers in heavy brushstrokes and splashes of vibrant color. In the early 1990s, Sandoval's semi-abstract paintings were con cerned with evoking a subjective experience of the landscape, al luded to in large canvases where, for instance, concentric waves pro duced by a leaf falling into a puddle of water create wonderfully poetic echoes. In Turnbull's serene landscapes peopled with human figures and simple objects, flowers and animals are sketched in mas terfully schematic lines, giving rise to a type of representation which demands we establish connections between image and concept. Flowers can also be a mere accessory in the composition, a decora tive detail used by so many artists that it would be impossible to men tion them all. As such, we will discuss four chosen at random. An tonio "Gritón" Ortiz (b. 1953) groups together objects such as flowers, pineapples, vacuum-cleaners and small flags, depicted with sketchy or even bristly lines, and fragments them in his psychedelic acrylic paintings where flowers appear as gadgets, scraps of Pop wallpaper. On the contrary, Carla Rippey (b. 1950), Nahum B. Zenil (b. 1943) and Lucfa Maya (b. 1953) produce beautiful drawings in which flowers are perverse creatures that sweetly torture martyred human figures. Exquisite, ambiguous, bleeding, wilted or offered as gifts, flowers are the obliging reflection of a state of mind: their physical qualities lend themselves to fantastic associations and interpretations. Flowers al ter a work's content and can be a sometimes ineffectual attempt at achieving visual coherence. They gain new life on paper and on can vas—an artificial life that allows some license in terms of experi mentation with artistic values and the limits of imagination. An en during theme in artistic creation, flowers have been and continue to be for most artists "a way back to paradise"—as Octavio Paz once said of the representation of fruit in poetry. £ Translated by Richard Moszka.

If you spring from the earth, hostile with thorns, avid for sky, in a vigorous thrust and offer a bud to the caress of a gentle breeze, a warm day, I know you will open to the sorceress morning your ephemeral perfection in the Rose. 1 know your perfume, your destiny, maiden's skin, myriad Host, your brief day, your gift. I watch the moment when you offer your wedding bed to the bees or a hummingbird paints itself in your colors and your silken petals droop: seashells of the air where your rose perfume and your brief life founder. vY v I repeat your name when 1 see, magnificent bird of plants, your nest anchored in the tree that nurtures you. The plumes of your petals, Orchid; the silence in which your colors sing. And 1 look for you in the shadows, under the wing of the tree that conceals you, where in the round branches you intone your chorus of blues, Hydrangea. But 1 also admire you and salute you, and 1 repeat your proletarian name, when you unfold, Nasturtium, your fragile parasols, your tremulous parasols, disciplined and round, where the dew trembles and you venture the simple offering of your yellow cones to the childish hand that immolates you. And you, humble Cortina, opening to the sun, closing to the night your dreams of becoming a Bougainvillea; And you, in a furious howl of yellow, with color you flaunt, Calendula, the perfume denied you in your poverty. And I contemplate your face, Daisy, your impeccable starched collar, your school uniform for the party, your round, innocent face. 1 salute your older sisters the Zinnias who have already learned the art of makeup and copy the Petunia's painted lips as it proffers its kiss stretching its lithe flirtatiousness from among the throngs of Cielo Raso that abduct it. 1 watch as the Acanthus sends up the erect towers of its spikes and how the Delphiniums raise, blue music, their belfries. What intangible liquor, is offered, tall Calla Lily, by your white goblets? What heavens do you multiply, Agapanthus, when you yield the seed of your universe from the outstretched arm of your stem? I watch you, Canna Lily, jaunty crest of a rooster with green wings; such a prolific family that you could not be a Gladiola, and you resign yourself to your fate as the poorest relation of that wealthy proprietress of shops, cellophane and bows. Nearby is the Retama, its long needles capture butterflies, yellow and small. The pollen from their captive wings hangs tiny grapes from the neighboring Mimosa. The least 1 can do to thank you for existing, O flower, multifold miracle, is to learn your name and repeat it. The Geranium's gypsy skirts dance motionless in a simple pot. When winter arrives; when the Dahlias sleep their stone gestation; when the Lilies snow sincere white buds; when the Poinsettia unfurls its stars, the Azaleas will don ballerina costumes, floating tulle skirts and languid pistils. The Azaleas will be your aristocracy, Geranium. 1 watch you climb, eminent flower, Gloriosa or Jasmine or Leadwort, surrendering your slender pale vine to the wayfarer; 1 see you, Bougainvillea, building a nest for men as if you were inviting them to be birds. 1 see you, Flameflower, anoint walls and windows with sunlight; and if I am filled with a childhood perfume with the afternoon condensed in its sweetness, 1 know you must be near, Honeysuckle. I admire you, tough, strange, hostile, glorious, dry and bitter and vivid like the hardy plant you adorn when your red bloom bursts from the Bisnaga which you crown with minuscule stars; when from the Nopalillo creeping among boulders of frozen lava, you spring like an alabaster star or bleed like a wound in the stone. "Forget me not!" cries the Forget-me-not gathering its astral shavings in the meadow where the Juanitas play while minding haughty Pansies; in the joyful meadow where the bright fireworks of the Snapdragons' run-of-the-mill organdy assail the eye, where the Wallflowers, drunk on aroma, paint their smiles red, white and purple and where the Violets, as befits their reputation, bow their heads and shrink in modesty. And 1 watch you, flower, spread your wings and perch in the branches of a tree; I watch you blaze with the passion of the Flamboyant that ignites Mérida's day. And cover with your sad twilight veil the Jacarandas of Guadalajara laying down tenuous carpets in lovers' paths. I watch you, Jacalasúchil, Frangipani, redeem the poverty of your stalks with a perfumed and perfect geometry; I watch you, Marigold, flower of the dead and of the poor, bringing new life and new wealth to my people. I breathe you in, Gardenia, Jessamine, Night Jasmine, Starflower; Heliotrope, Madonna Lily, Tuberose; because you are form, color and perfume; because, flower, you are life's essence, the world's youth, the air's beauty, the coded music of the planet; because you are fragile, brief, delicate, racing toward death: your sacrifice, consecration and eternal life. The least 1 can do to thank you for existing, to praise God who has created you, O flower, multifold miracle, is to learn your name and repeat it in a litany of colors and a symphony of perfumes.
