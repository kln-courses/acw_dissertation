<plain_text><page sequence="1">Artistic Practice and Education in India: A Historical Overview SAMUEL K. PARKER This essay is intended to provide a brief, general overview of the historical transformations in the identity and education of artists in India from ancient times to the present. 1 This will require some consideration of how one becomes an artist, what it means to be an artist, what exactly it is that the artist makes, how it is made, for whom, and for what purposes. An- swers to these questions will be developed within a dialectical, historical model of the valorization and transformation of cultural categories. The most dramatic historical transformations of the ancient Indian system of art and artistic production occurred when political sovereignty was assumed by rulers who identified with a set of foreign cultural values, resulting in a transformational synthesis of different artistic orders. The two major instances of this process to be considered here will be the relation of the Hindu Sanskritic art tradition of the first millennium A.D. (as represented by the ancient texts on art, the Silpaiastras) with foreign artistic values brought to India by Islamic conquerers early in the second millenium A.D. and later in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by the British. In ancient Indian terminology there is no precise equivalent for the English word 'artist.' Stella Kramrisch observes that the closest corres- ponding Sanskrit term, silpin or silpi, is not adequately translated by any of the corresponding English categories 'artist,' 'artisan,' or 'craftsman.' This is due to the fact that the practice of temple and image making in- volves more than just the production of objects and is believed to possess a "magic power" to effect specific transformations in the nature of its makers, sponsors, and users.2 According to abundant references in the Silpasastras, image making is the hereditary occupation of the descen- dants of the five mythic sons of Visvakarma, the divine artificer. Today in Samuel K. Parker is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Anthropology of the University of Chicago. He has published in Pacific Studies and is pursuing research on the hereditary temple architects of South India.

Parker South India those who claim such descent still form a distinct community known as the Visvakarma Brahman, or Kammalar, caste, many of whom continue to pursue the occupations of their ancestors. Most of what is known about the traditions of the jsilpis has been gleaned from the Silpasastras, not from the study of actual practices. One of the few exceptions is A. K. Coomaraswamy's The Indian Craftsman.3 Al- though it is not intended to be an ethnography, it was written partly on the basis of the author's familiarity with traditional hereditary South Indian and Sinhalese artists. He provides a few glimpses of the traditions of practice which are rather different from the theoretical analyses presented in the ancient texts. He notes that the young silpin was traditionally trained from childhood in the workshop of a master, who was usually the father or other close relative, but not necessarily so. Most importantly, he was able to observe that the relationship of student and master was one of reverent devotion and service: "In the workshop, technique is learnt from the beginning, and in relation to real things and real problems, and pri- marily by service, personal attendance on the master."4 Birth into the Visvakarma Brahman caste establishes only the nature and potential of the individual. That nature must be transformed and realized not only through the teaching of the master, but also by means of a literal incorporation of the master's being (in a very concrete sense) through the direct and in- direct physical contacts entailed by devoted service, formalized in gestures such as in touching the master's feet and eating his leftovers. This method of instruction apparently follows from an epistemological conviction that what the master knows and practices is inseparable from what the master is, part and parcel of the very substance of his body, reflecting a pervasive South Asian point of view which McKim Marriott has described as the nonduality of code and substance.5 This master-disciple dimension of the training of artists is not included in the ancient texts. It is only observable in practice. In contrast, the Silpasastras tend to give the impression that artistic practice simply follows from the prescriptions of textbooks. It would be a mistake, therefore, to use the Silpasastras uncritically as if they accurately represented the processes and results of practice; but as yet there is no alternative to their use since no ethnography of the actual prac- tices of traditional south Indian artists has ever been done. For present purposes, then, the ancient texts will be used to obtain the sort of infor- mation for which they are most valuable: that is, to identify certain cul- tural values and intentions of artistic practice. The products of the silpin are known as silpa and kala. Both are usually translated as 'art'; however, their semantic values are more comprehensive than their English counterpart. In ancient texts such as the Saivatantra, the Sukranitisara, and the Kamastitra, 'kala' is analyzed as sixty-four dif- ferent kinds of skilled activities and knowledge, including not only the</page><page sequence="3">Art and Education in India 125 visual, musical, and theatrical arts, but also such skills as acrobatics, cook- ing, barbering, and lovemaking.6 The meaning of the word 'silpa' gener- ally overlaps with that of 'kala,' except that it tends to be applied more specifically to skills involving manual labor as opposed to theatrical arts.7 According to the Sukranitisara, images may be differentiated according to substance, guna (quality), and proportion.8 The significant differences of substance are temporal: "Images made of sand, dough, or painted, or of stucco, or terracotta, or wood, or stone, or metal are of relative durability in the same order." Furthermore, the text specifies the use of specific metals for image making according to the cosmic age, or yuga: gold, silver, copper, and bronze for the satya, treta, dwapar, and kali yugas, respective- ly. The difference of quality, or guna, is determined by the posture and the nature of the activities represented: figures seated in padmasana (lotus posture) or standing perfectly straight in the samabbaniga posture are sattvika (which may be roughly translated as having the quality of stillness or balanced harmony); those exhibiting a variety of ornaments or weapons and standing in the triflexed tribbanga posture or on a vehicle are rajasika (having the quality of activity); and those shown slaying demons and ex- pressing dread are considered tamasika (having the quality of inertia or obstruction). The importance of correct proportion is said to increase relative to the permanence of the image's substance; irregularities are more or less innocuous depending on the ephemerality of the image.9 The signif- icance of proportion is further temporalized in the Sukranitisara through a correlation of the prescribed measurement of images according to cosmic age, although this (and the similar injunction about the use of metals) was obviously never followed in practice. 10 The significance of these criteria is related to the temporal, transforma- tional purposes of the work. The Silpa~astras list in great detail the good and bad effects that accrue to the silpin, the donor (or yajamana), or to the worshiper from the excellences (guna) or defects (dosa) of a work of architecture, sculpture, or painting. The statements of the Pratimamanalak- sanam are typical: The head made like an umbrella brings prosperity of wealth and grain. The beautiful line of the eyebrow and forehead give eternal prosperity. If the idol is well modeled the subjects become happy.... If the image is deficient in length or breadth, there would be famine and national breakage ... If the face is not made according to the Sastras, the yajamana [donor] would be killed. If the face is made according to the Sastras, he flourishes with his relatives. 11 The products of silpa not only represent a world, they construct and transform it; not only do they demonstrate the perpetual transformation of the world (as for example, through swaying and dancing images swirl- ing around the axis mundi rising from the heart of the temple), but they</page><page sequence="4">126 Samuel K. Parker also effect the transformation of those involved in their construction and use.12 According to the Silpapraka-a, through the knowledge and mastery of art (silpavidya and silpasiddbi) the artist gains bliss, inexhaustible merit, and freedom from rebirth.1 3 The practice of disciplines that specifically involve the making of images are described as a form of contemplative yoga in the Sukranitisara. 14 Like the building of temples, yoga is also intended to produce the spiritual transformation of the individual. The sculptor/painter is expected to per- form dbyana (meditative visualization) on the form of the being to be represented, thereby harmonizing, ideologically at least, the method of production with its intended purposes. 1 For the yajamana the erection of temples is said to confer fame, the dissolution of countless sins, and spiritual liberation: When a Raja, endowed with a hundred kingdoms, with hundreds of villages, with a hundred bags of gold, when that best king with a hundred wives of golden limbs, with the power of a hundred arms, does not erect a temple that will stand forever, all this will be fruit- less. All things, wealth, grain, and children vanish with the passing of time. Everything vanishes with time, only a monument will last forever. 16 The paradigmatic statement of the transformational power of art is given in the Aitareya Brahbmana (6.5.27) which states that "Silpani, works of art of man, are an imitation of divine forms; by employing their rhythms, a metrical reconstitution is effected of the limited human personality." These primal rhythms are represented in their most pure form in numerical systems of proportion and the geometric yantras called paiijaras which are used to organize compositions. 17 Except for the concentrated, geometric images utilized as supports for meditation by the practicing yogi, such structures are invariably cloaked in the organic forms of mountains, plants, animals, and, most of all, human beings. Virtually all the textual injunc- tions concerning the nuances of proportion are given in reference to the human form. One of the fundamental examples of this is the vastupurusa mandala, a fusion of an anthropomorphic form and a geometric structure which is used to formulate the basic ground plan of the Hindu temple. 18 The construction of a temple (which is simultaneously a world and a body) possessing an ideal organization in stone is an act that serves to bring the natural world (and the bodies of those involved in its making and use) into harmony with the divine order. Aesthetic experience of the products of such activities (i.e., the tasting of rasa, the emotional 'juice' of the work) is considered to possess an analogous nature and purpose. Abhinavagupta describes the experience of rasa as "similar [literally 'twin'] to the tasting of the supreme Brahman."1 9 The temple and its images are therefore intended as more than representations; they are</page><page sequence="5">Art and Education in India 127 instruments having the power to transform human beings and their exper- iences into the divine essence of what is being represented through their production and use. Just as the temple/image is a fusion of geometric structure and organic form, the master artist is similarly a conjunction of cultural knowledge and a physical body. What he knows is inseparable from what he is as a physical being. Structure is incarnated in the master just as it informs the objects he produces. Through metonymic service and devotion to a living master, the junior apprentice is transformed into the paradigmatic repro- duction of the object of his devotion. Likewise, through devotion to his work, he is substantially transformed into its essential, divine nature. In this epistemology, what one knows and does is literally incorporated into the substance of one's being. The practice of visual arts at the levels of training, production, and use may be effectively understood to be organ- ized by this cultural perspective. If the incarnated master artist is the primary factor in the education of artists, what is the nature and role of the Silpasastras? A number of con- temporary stbapatis (architect/sculptors) in South India own and revere inherited Sanskrit manuscripts of various Silpasastras; however, they are not using them in the making of images. Instead, the artists follow systems of production they learned as apprentices. In fact, since very few of them read Sanskrit, they do not even understand the methods prescribed in the texts they possess.20 Is this due to the modern degeneration of the tradi- tion? It seems not. According to P. N. Bose, it is extremely difficult to find examples of ancient art anywhere in India that seem to conform strictly to the prescriptions of the Silpaiastras.21 Even the texts them- selves sometimes acknowledge the priority of the living tradition. For ex- ample, the Sukranitisara expresses two seemingly contradictory views on the subject of correct proportion. On one hand, correct proportion is said to be that which is prescribed by the Silpakastras; on the other hand, the standards of pleasing proportion are established by "such images as have been made by experts."2 2 This contradiction makes sense, however, if the apparently absolute prescriptions of the Silpasastras are seen to have de- veloped through a dialogue between literary practice on the one hand and the visual art production of the silpin on the other. The construction of temples and images traditionally required the par- ticipation of a yajamana (sacrificer/patron), a silpin, and a Brahman priest.2 3 The Silpasastras were certainly not the products of the yajamana, and perhaps not even originally that of the 'ilpin, but more likely the work of the Brahman priest, whose usual function it was to produce such texts. One might speculate that the Brahman priest could exercise a greater degree of power and control relative to the patron and the artist by pro- ducing and referring to authoritative written texts. Later on the artists</page><page sequence="6">128 Samuel K. Parker themselves probably began to produce such texts as part of an effort to raise their social status. The Visvakarma community's claim to Brahman status was primarily based on their sacred ritual practice and knowledge, which, by some as yet uncertain time in the first millennium A.D., appar- ently included knowledge of Sanskrit and the production of palm-leaf manuscripts after the example of the high-status Brahman community. In any case, the Silpa~astras should not be thought of as fixed textbooks used either in the education of artists or as manuals for practice, but as the products and instruments of a dialogue among donors, priests, and artists in which a symbolic world of monuments and social identities was being constructed. This view is supported by a unique Orissan text, the Silpapraka-a, in which the author specifically identifies himself as an architect (stbapati). Unlike the broad generalities typically contained in other Silpa~astras, this text is devoted to the production of a specific type of Tantric temple with which the author is intimately familiar. The text is singular in that its typological descriptions are so precise that they may be correlated with the ruins of a couple of extant Orissan temples dated approximately to the twelfth century. The surviving manuscripts are also unique in that they provide actual drawings of the yantra-like diagrams used to structure the temple and to order the figural compositions on its walls. The author lavishes great praise on the Silpasastras because they owe their origin to Visvakarma, the divine ;silpin. However, he also makes a very interesting comment on the purpose and limitations of written texts such as his own: This Silpapraka-a book is meant only for the instruction of disciples. No knowledge or even a part of knowledge can be conveyed in such an abridged form . . . By the order and influence of my Sadguru Madhava Bhatta, who is conversant with various silpas (this book was written) for the (benefit) instruction of disciples only. In the understanding of various best sastras there are differences due to local customs, the temples are of various types, according to regions and canons. Since there are different methods in the local ways of work, these sastras are founded on the practice of the kaulacara (on local practice). Although I am poor of knowledge, on the strength of practical experience and with the knowledge given by my Guru, as it was heard (and read), this book is made.., .to be re- vealed to disciples.24 This text is thus produced for the benefit of those who already know, or are learning, its contents through the method of discipleship. An impor- tant structural opposition within the ancient artistic dialogue is clearly identifiable in this text as the absolute nature of the cosmic order, as codi- fied in the Silpa~astras, opposed to the relativity of local practice. The author explicitly privileges the local customs of artistic practice over the SilpaJastras, implicitly endorsing the primacy of education from the living guru over that which is recorded in texts.</page><page sequence="7">Art and Education in India 129 It may be reasonably hypothesized that the guru-disciple system of art education and production in ancient India gradually entered into a dialec- tical relationship with written texts on the visual arts beginning sometime in the middle of the first millenium A.D. Since certain local traditions must have formed the basis for the written texts and since they are by nature idealized statements, their dissemination naturally resulted in a sub- stantial dissonance between written theory and observable practice. This dissonance produced subtle transformational pressures internal to the indigenous Indian system on both the writing of such texts and the making of temples and images. The introduction of Islamic rule in India brought a set of artistic values and purposes that significantly modified the training and practices of affected groups of artists. According to R. Lewcock, little is known about the traditional education of painters, sculptors, and architects in Islamic countries since it was apparently not considered a noteworthy subject for Muslim scholars; however, it seems that they, like their Hindu counter- parts, were apprenticed in their hereditary occupations to master artists, received a strong training in mathematics and geometry, and travelled widely in the course of their careers.2 5 The first major Islamic monument in India, the Kutb Minar and its asso- ciated mosque, was evidently built by Hindu workmen under the verbal instructions of their patrons. Aside from the calligraphy, its relief sculp- ture is quite similar to that which might have appeared on a contemporary Hindu temple, with the important exception that it is purged of all zoo- morphic and anthropomorphic imagery in conformity to the Islamic in- junctions against such representations. Furthermore, the mosque's arches are constructed in such a way as to leave little doubt that no Islamic builder was involved in the work.2 6 Later improvements to the site in 1199 A.D. are accurately constructed in the style of the Saljuqs, an Islamic empire centered in Asia Minor, from where Kutb-ud-din apparently imported workmen who either constructed or closely supervised the work. From then on, Islamic architecture in India was either executed by artists from the Middle East, or, as increasingly came to be the case, by Indians trained to work in foreign styles. The dialectic of Sastric literature and the visual arts operating under the Hindu kings was supplemented under Islamic rule by a dialogue of indig- enous and foreign artistic values. It is widely held that the Hindu architec- tural tradition, in which a building was essentially conceived as a work of sculpture, and the Middle Eastern traditions of structural engineering were gradually synthesized to produce the unique character of Indian Islamic architecture which flourished under Mughal rule. E. B. Havell argues, for example, that it is precisely the Hindu sense of figural sculpture fused with</page><page sequence="8">130 Samuel K. Parker the Islamic sense of architectural form which accounts for the unique posi- tion of the Taj Mahal within the Islamic art world.2 7 The requirements of mosques and tombs made possible a specialization of designer, stone carver, painter, and laborer which did not exist in the same form in Hindu architecture. Muslim buildings were raised by differ- ent classes of craftsmen on the basis of precise plans provided by salaried master builders. The A 'in-i-Akbari lists a variety of workmen involved in building projects, including lime masons, stone masons, bricklayers, and tile makers, and the amount and basis of the wages they received.2 8 This division of labor was made possible partly through an objectification of architectural projects in the form of models and detailed drawings.29 In the Hindu system such a variety of duties might be performed by appren- tice-disciples who, in the course of their careers, would acquire compe- tence in all dimensions of their work in the process of becoming masters themselves. Since the Hindu temple was conceived as a sculptural mass, the carvers would each have had to internalize the whole project in relation to the task at hand without reference to objectified plans. This is especially apparent when one considers the requirements of the numerous rock-cut caves and monolithic temples carved in situ by Indian silpis. The Mughal use of architectural plans allowed the patron to be highly involved in the specification of details. This relationship is graphically memorialized in a well-known miniature which depicts Babur discussing a drawing for a formal garden with his master builder.30 In the case of a traditional Hindu temple the donor, or yajamana, might specify broad aspects of the project such as the type and size of the structure, but both the detailed planning and the execution of the work would be the job of those whose substantive knowledge and powers (silpavidya and jsilpasiddhi) corresponded to the task. Painting under the Mughals also became specialized and strongly influ- enced by patrons through monetary and other incentives (such as robes of honor). The royal Mughal workshops were founded with the employment of the Safavid miniature painters Mir Musavvir and his son, Mir Sayyid Ali, by the emporer Humayun during his exile in Persia. They were later joined by Abd al-Samad from Shiraz after Humayun had regained the throne in India.3 1 The two younger painters presided over the flourishing school of painting patronized by Humayun's son Akbar. The earliest work of their Hindu students was not surprisingly Persian in character, but it also exhib- ited a subtle tendency toward what is often called an Indian "naturalism" or "realism." This quality was apparently encouraged by Akbar, and the products of his workshop gradually drifted farther and farther away from Middle Eastern prototypes. It is specifically the Hindu painters who are praised by Abu'l Fazl as unsurpassed in the mastery of their art. In refer- ence to their mimetic skills he favorably compares their work to the excel-</page><page sequence="9">Art and Education in India 131 lence of European painting.32 An interest in the faithful representation of an object's appearance is even more highly developed in the reigns of Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and, to the extent that painting was tolerated, under Aurangzeb. This particular trend in Mughal art suggests an objectification of the locus of knowledge (i.e., the correspondence of the work to an ex- ternal standard observable in nature) similar in significance to the objecti- fication of architectural plans. It seems that the Hindu theory of the substantiality of the artist's knowledge and skills was also part of the Mughal synthesis. This is sug- gested by Abu'l Fazl's identification of the artist with the material ele- ment of "air" within the constitution of the "political body" of the state (which may, in turn, be understood to coincide with the physical body of the king).33 The robes of honor, and even the monetary receipts of the artist provided by the Mughal king, possessed the value of the actual sub- stance of that "political body." This is similar to the way in which the Hindu apprentice incorporates the physical form of his guru, but here an important transformation has occurred: in this case it is the patron who has become the primary object of devotion. The careful representation of an external natural world in Mughal paint- ing should not blind us to the fact that it was no less involved in the con- struction of a cultural vision of reality than Hindu art. This is obvious in the case of architecture. The Mughal tomb is a cosmological statement in some ways analogous to the Hindu temple. It forms a tangible reality, not only of the social identity of its builder, but also of his or her moral and spiritual position. The tomb is conceived as a divine palace in the center of a primordial paradise garden which represents the eternal destiny of the deceased. The expression of wealth and temporal power through an elabor- ate tomb reproduces the relative social status of its owner in the next world. This purpose would not be completely foreign to the Hindu silpin for whom the construction of a temple is also intended to affect the future destiny of its builders. However, for the Hindu, the effect of a building is mediated by the temporality of moral action (i.e., karma). For the Mus- lim, a tomb or mosque is the effect of a political and moral commitment to Islam. British political power in India brought the traditions of silpa into a fur- ther dialogue with European artistic values, which were themselves at a particular stage of development at the time. The ancient Latin term 'ars,' like its Greek counterpart, was originally used to signify a range of skilled activities similar in breadth (though not in specific content) to 'kala' and 'silpa.' In the eighteenth century, European writers began to distinguish between the "fine arts" and the "useful arts," defined according to the criteria of beauty and function, respectively.34 The "useful arts" further</page><page sequence="10">132 Samuel K. Parker shifted in value during the Industrial Revolution to include a distinction between handicrafts-literally made by hand-and manufactures. By the mid-nineteenth century George Birdwood noted that the category of manufactures had come "to lose well nigh all trace of its true etymological meaning, and is now generally used for the process of the conversion of raw materials into articles suitable for use by man by machinery.'" 3 The problematic criterion of beauty was gradually undermined as the defining feature of 'fine arts' during the nineteenth century and came to be replaced by the categorical criteria of 'genius' and 'creativity'. In the last two hun- dred years or so the Western idea of creativity has come to be almost synonymous with novelty. The dominant creation mythology of the West (which we of course believe to be a universal psychology of creativity rather than a cultural mythology) entails a belief in unprecedented, discon- tinuous acts of pure creation which are the private property of the creative ego. Subsequently the categorical content of the "fine arts" has been re- valued with increasing frequency in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to the point where revalorization itself has become an essential feature of the category, each new artistic movement necessarily proposing a novel re- definition of fine art which, if successful, insures the historical significance of its author(s). Since they were informed by quite different myths of cre- ation, these Western artistic values did not apply easily to the anonymous traditional artistic practices of India. In 1878 Birdwood noted that the official classifications of 'art' and 'industry' adopted at the European Universal Exhibitions of Art and In- dustry were not relevant to India, since everything in India at the time was still produced by hand and was, therefore, a kind of art. But he also argued: "On the other hand, it is impossible to rank the decorative arts of India, which is a crystallised tradition, although perfect in form, with the ever living, progressive arts of Europe, wherein the inventive and creative genius of the true poet, acting on his own spontaneous inspirations, asserts itself, and which constitute the Fine Arts, as they are called."36 The author here makes explicit the "inventive and creative genius" that was becoming definitive of fine arts at the time. Although he was a great admirer of Indian decorative arts, Birdwood claimed that sculpture and painting as fine arts were unknown in India due to the ill effects of Indian mythology; rendering the monstrous shapes of Puranic deities prevented the develop- ment of the "higher forms of artistic representation."'7 British interest in Indian decorative arts appeared in the context of a widespread dissatisfaction with the generally poor quality of goods being turned out by increasingly mechanized industries in Europe. In 1835 the industrialist Robert Peel introduced a motion to the House of Commons for the establishment of a national gallery of art in order to improve the aesthetic tastes of both manufacturers and consumers, thereby raising the</page><page sequence="11">Art and Education in India 133 artistic standards of industry and contributing to the success of British commerce. Also in the same year a select committee was formed to study and propose means of raising the educational standards of designers and craftsmen in England. Their report recommended the establishment of Schools of Design that would lead to "the direct practical application of the Arts to Manufactures."3 8 Toward this goal a sincere but unsuccessful movement developed, centered in the art school at South Kensington, to unite art and industry in a practical cooperation. While the Indian section of the Great Exhibition of 1851 was generally well received, the British manufactures on display proved to be an embar- rassment to British industry. The man in charge of this exhibit was Henry Cole, who had founded an art-in-industry firm called Summerly's Art Manufactures in 1847. He and his colleagues were among the most vocal critics of the British display which they themselves had organized, citing the poor showing as proof of the mismanagement of the Schools of Design. Through his Journal of Design and Manufacture, Cole and his associates waged a successful campaign to gain control over the schools. During his controversial tenure as Director of the Schools of Design from 1852 to 1873, Cole's major "reform" was to institute a program of rigidly con- trolled training in drawing as the primary emphasis of the curriculum. There was very little cooperation with industry, in spite of Cole's stated objectives, and the graduates of the program were not prepared to become either designers, fine artists, or technicians.3 9 It was Cole's vision of the art school which came to be reproduced in India. Just as a nostalgic, idealizing appreciation of traditional handicrafts was developing in mid-nineteenth-century England in reaction to industrial manufactures, schools of art were being set up in Madras in 1853, Calcutta in 1854, and Bombay in 1857 to promote the modernization of Indian handicrafts and to adapt their designs to suit British taste, reflecting the evangelical and utilitarian agenda of the British administration in the first half of the nineteenth century. The curriculum of these institutions was directly patterned after the South Kensington program with the inten- tion to improve the aesthetic quality of Indian design for the benefit of industry and commerce. As at South Kensington, the course work insti- tuted to achieve this aim was essentially devoted to drawing and sketching, which were believed to be the foundation of all the other disciplines: painting, sculpture, architecture, and design. Casts of classical statuary, undistinguished drawings, paintings, and reproductions of older Euro- pean work were provided as examples. The Indian student was expected to learn proper perspective, shading, and anatomy by copying these images and sketching from nature. Some twenty-five years after the establishment of these schools George Birdwood observed in his Handbook to the British Indian Section of the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1878 that British</page><page sequence="12">134 Samuel K. Parker "meddling" in India's traditional arts had been "anything but encourag- ing."440 These schools did not attract the sons of working artists, but rather students who had received a literary education in other government schools and were attempting to imbibe elite British culture. Although many of them came from "artisan castes," they proved to have no inten- tion of pursuing their family occupations, nor indeed even to make a living with their hands. In 1876 not a single student of any of the art schools could be found who had gone into any form of art as a career. Instead, they either entered government service or one of the professional occupa- tions considered suitable for an educated Indian.4 1 If Cole's program of art education had little success in England, its application to India was even more disappointing. Meanwhile back in Great Britain, Cole's South Kensington effort to marry art to industry was being severely criticized by John Ruskin who argued that the failures of this approach were due to the fact that its aims were materialist instead of moral and social. He insisted that production should be judged in terms of human happiness instead of material criteria. Mechanical industry dehumanizes workers; devoid of the opportunity to be responsible artists, they would be able to obtain no satisfaction or spir- itual sustenance from their labor. Ruskin's prescription was socialism. According to his "Political Economy of Art" lectures delivered in 1857, innate "art-intellect" is a fixed, scarce quantity in any nation. It is the responsibility of the government to manage this resource effectively by adopting a paternalistic role deliberately modelled after British domestic relationships. The government should provide "trial schools" in which art- intellect can be observed and strictly disciplined, followed by an enno- bling liberal arts education in order to produce the refinement of character necessary for the making of art; and finally the state should provide secure, unhurried employment to artists on as wide a variety of projects as pos- sible. He also proposed that the state establish qualitative standards for manufactures and reestablish the medieval guild system.4 2 In the absence of any satisfactory official response to his proposal, Ruskin founded the short-lived utopian commune St. Georges Guild in 1871. It was this socialist/traditionalist vision represented theoretically by the likes of Ruskin, William Morris, and Charles R. Ashbee, and expressed in practice by the Arts and Crafts movement, which provided the basic theoretical paradigm reproduced and adapted for the Indian arena by J. L. Kipling, E. B. Havell, and A. K. Coomaraswamy. The Indian side of the controversy reflexively participated in the British polemics. Certain idealized aspects of Indian artistic production were held up as a model for the industrialized West. In his foreword to Coomaras- wamy's The Indian Craftsman Ashbee writes: It is a curious and suggestive thought that the spiritual reawakening</page><page sequence="13">Art and Education in India 135 in England, which goes now by the name of the higher culture, now by the name of Socialism, which has been voiced in our time by Ruskin and Morris, which has expressed itself in movements like the arts and crafts, or is revealed in the inspired paintings of the Pre- Raphaelites, demands just such a condition as in India our commer- cialism is destroying . . . Here once more we are learning from the East. The English craftsman and the English village are passing, or have passed away . . .Not only [in] England, but [in] all Western countries that have been touched by the green-sickness of industrial machinery ... Who knows, perhaps Vilvakarma is the god for whom we in the West, in our spiritual reawakening, are in search; possibly he can help us.43 Following the 1857 revolt and the establishment of British Imperial rule in India, a new official concern for the preservation of Indian antiq- uities, traditional institutions, and the reconstruction of Indian history gradually appeared as elements of the British paradigm of empire: India was seen to stand in relation to Britain in much the same position as Greece had to ancient Rome. This new official attitude harmonized nicely with the paternalistic and traditionalist outlook of the Arts and Crafts move- ment at home and bore fruit in the careers of J. L. Kipling (father of Rudyard Kipling) and E. B. Havell, whose directorships of Indian art schools in the last quarter of the nineteenth century introduced the goals of preservation and revival into the purposes of art education in India. Nevertheless, their views never became hegemonic, in fact they always represented a minority opinion during their careers, a circumstance which perhaps fueled their obvious sense of mission. C. Burns labelled them the "archaeologists" who had "pinned their faith in a possible revival of the crafts upon a strict adherence to the ancient traditional types of design and practice" in contrast to "the practical men" like himself who "based their hopes of improvement upon the introduction of European methods."44 After he became director of the Mayo School of Art in Lahore in 1872, Kipling attempted to reorganize the curriculum according to his concept of a traditional crafts workshop rather than a drawing school. While West- ern standards of efficiency and precision were encouraged, indigenous forms and styles were promoted as models for production. When Havell assumed leadership of the Government School of Art in Madras in 1884, he also reorganized the program there following Kipling's example. He got rid of the examples of European imagery which had been used as teaching aids in the drawing classes and replaced them with indigenous models.45 Both Kipling and Havell realized that in order to preserve, and in some cases revive, traditional Indian art, it would be necessary to promote a demand for it. Architecture was seen to be the key to this objective, since the traditional arts of painting, sculpture, and various sorts of furnishings were closely integrated with the production of traditional kinds of build-</page><page sequence="14">136 Samuel K. Parker ings. "Architecture is the principal door through which the artistic sense of the people finds expression. If that door is choked with rubbish, as it is in India, it is surprising that art industries should decline?"'46 The "rub- bish" that Havell refers to is the much-despised utilitarian civil archi- tecture produced by the colonial public works department and the equally deprecated eclectic European-style homes being raised by the Indian upper classes. Throughout his career Havell relentlessly agitated, with little suc- cess, for the Indian government to hire traditional Indian artists to design and execute all public works projects in India. F. S. Growse, a colleague of J. L. Kipling, who was intimately involved in the promotion of traditional Indian architecture in Mathura, reports a revealing conversation with an upper-class Indian who had recently con- structed a home in Bulandshahr utilizing a conglomerate of European styles. The native gentleman clearly understood architecture to be a sign of political and class distinctions and politely considered the British tradi- tionalist a curiosity: The works which are carried out under your direction, however pleasing in themselves, have the one fatal drawback that they are not stamped with official approval. . ... Your buildings fitly express your own peculiarity of temperament, but this personal predilection for Indian forms is only a weakness or eccentricity; such designs would be out of harmony with my own more advanced views which are all in favor of English fashions. The trading classes do well to adhere to the Hindustani types, but the landed gentry prefer to range them- selves with their rulers and thus emphasize their distinction from the vulgar.4 7 When Growse pursued the question further, arguing that the combina- tion of decorative elements on the new home was not even appropriate from a European point of view, the Indian gentleman could not under- stand how that was possible. "In the same way as Christianity is popularly identified with any denials of religious obligation, so the essence of Euro- pean architecture is supposed to consist in a reckless disregard of all recog- nized canons of ornament and proportion .. . any ugliness in a building is accounted European."48 Apparently to the educated Indian gentleman the distinction between indigenous and European architecture was not only one of politics and social class, but also of structure versus anti- structure. Educated Indians were not alone in their unsympathetic reaction to the British view of the traditionalist cause. The lower classes, and even tradi- tional artists themselves, were not really supportive of the cause simply because it made no sense to them: "The people themselves, if questioned as to the existence and prospects of an indigenous art, entirely fail to com- prehend the purpose of the enquiry . .. and true artists, capable of really beautiful design, will sometimes humbly apologize for it as a poor 'country'</page><page sequence="15">Art and Education in India 137 effort, and look with admiration on a neatly ruled and colored mechanical drawing by an engineering apprentice."49 Constituting an indigenous Indian tradition of "fine art" in the sense of European cultural categories became an important part of the traditional- ists' mission. Havell in particular pressed for the promotion of Indian painting, sculpture, and architecture, both ancient and modern, to the status of "fine arts." In this context he was able to get a sympathetic hearing from the more nationalistic of the Indian upper classes. On one hand, the distinction of handicrafts and fine arts was an appealingly mod- ern European notion which carried the distinction of moral and class dif- ferences; and on the other, it coincided with the nationalistic political interests of Indian elites for whom the apparent continuity of an ancient and modern all-Indian tradition of "fine art" served to signify a legitimate national identity. Ironically, Havell's educational efforts were never instru- mental in the production of any traditional Indian artists; rather, his major contribution was in the emergence of an elite, urban, nationalistic modern art (through his support of Abanindranath Tagore and the Bengali school) and a European-style art history of India (through his own writings and encouragement of scholars such as A. K. Coomaraswamy). These projects were European in form but insistently Indian in content. Of course, an Indian content in European form is not anything traditionally Indian in the sense that it was intended, it is Indian tradition as dialectically consti- tuted by such a form. It is a contemporary construction of a traditional world through metonyms of its prior existence. Since Independence, the semantic and social distinctions between fine arts, handicrafts, and industrial arts have been institutionalized through the establishment of the Lalit Kala Academy for fine arts and the All- India Handicrafts Board for traditional crafts and cottage industries. The Lalit Kala Academy encourages research into ancient Indian art and directs training, exhibitions, and research in the field of contemporary art. This does not include contemporary traditional artists such as the South Indian silpin, but rather those who produce "art" in the Western sense of an on- going exploration of personal expression and visual possibilities. Successful contemporary artists in India are maintained through the sale of their products to wealthy individuals, corporations, and the state at substantial prices, in some cases similar to international standards. Like their Western counterparts, those who are less fortunate supplement their income by retainer fees from galleries, teaching positions, or commercial designing; others languish in want.s 0 At the upper socioeconomic level of Indian society art objects are sold as atomized, high-cost, high-status con- sumer goods, ostensibly for the direct purpose of aesthetic contemplation and indirectly as investments. Support of "creative arts" has become a sign of a cultured, enlightened government and of the status and legitimization</page><page sequence="16">138 Samuel K. Parker of wealth for individuals and corporations. The official statement of Indian government policy toward the arts reported to UNESCO admits that the central academy has only a marginal association with the art departments of schools, colleges, and universities (which largely follow the lead of their Western counterparts) and has done little to promote contact between creative artists and the traditional artisans.5 1 Traditional artisans and their work belong to a lower social and com- mercial status. Their separation from contemporary "creative arts" is insti- tutionalized through the All-India Handicrafts Board (AIHB). The AIHB conducts surveys of crafts, does research into improved production tech- nology, and provides marketing, exhibition, and credit facilities. It runs a craft museum, centers for the revival of handicrafts and the training of craftsmen and salesmen, and also operates design improvement centers where new forms are deliberately produced and old forms modified in order to enhance their marketability.5 2 It constitutes its charges according to a scheme of fine, useful, and industrial arts similar to that developed in nineteenth-century Europe. Fine arts, delegated to the Lalit Kala Academy, are officially distinguished from the AIHB's handicrafts (e.g., carpets, in- cense, perfume, and traditional low-status forms of temple architecture, stone and bronze sculpture) and village or cottage industries (e.g., carpen- try, fruit processing, aluminum utensils, oil and soap production, and so forth). The producers of village industrial arts are classed as "artisans" in official AIHB documents, whereas the producers of handicrafts are re- ferred to as "craftsmen." Handicrafts are distinguished from village indus- tries by the use of traditional materials, emphasis on decoration, and the nature of their marketing. Since they are thought to possess more the character of decorative, luxury items, handicrafts are produced for both export and domestic consumption, while the more utilitarian village industries are primarily intended only for the latter.s 3 In the context of the modern Indian market economy, time has become a monetarily valorized commodity. It is a medium of productive efficiency and sales. As consumer goods, the designs of handicrafts are subject to the relentless changes of fashion. This places traditional crafts in a paradox, since their status as traditional requires the persistence of forms, whereas their status as consumer goods requires adaptation to the changing market. The measurement of time in terms of production and marketing efficiency also forces the producer to negotiate a course between the contradictory aims of quantity and quality. The pursuit of quantitative efficiency in handmade production normally entails a sacrifice of quality and vice versa. In the silpa mode of production these particular contradictions do not arise. Time is instead a medium of transformation in which apprentices are transformed into masters, substances are transformed into potent con- structions of reality, and the patrons, makers, and users of art are all mor- ally transformed in the direction of its divine harmonies.</page><page sequence="17">Art and Education in India 139 There are indications that at some levels of artistic production and edu- cation the traditional values of silpa and kala continue to be practiced in some form. Among the Visvakarma Brahmans of South India the ancient arts of temple construction and image making are still being transmitted from father to son through the guru-disciple method of instruction.5 4 Al- though the AIHB categorizes their work as handicraft, it classes the ancient sculpture produced in very similar styles by their ancestors as fine art. This is a categorical distinction which the Visvakarma Brahmans themselves do not recognize. To them, both their own work and that of their ancestors is seen in terms of the ancient, broader conception of kala.5s s Thus it seems that Western artistic values have not simply eclipsed those of the indigenous system; rather, the contemporary methods of art production and education in India are a complex, historically generated synthesis of cultural categories in which some domains appear to express a preponder- ance of traditional values while others seem to have adapted the artistic categories of Western countries to suit a contemporary Indian view of the world. NOTES 1. This is admittedly a rather vague specification of a time frame. It derives from the nature of the ancient Sanskrit texts on art, which do not provide a fine- grained historical pattern. Most of the extant manuscripts are seventeenth- to nineteenth-century copies of texts which are believed to have been rendered in written form mostly between the sixth and twelfth centuries; however, the tra- ditions they record are probably much more ancient.

This view presupposes a theory of representation as illustration and mimesis; presumably, if Indian mythology had provided artists with more naturalistic subject matter, their art might have been able to progress toward a more faithful representation of nature. Actually, the descriptions of gods in the Puranas probably owe at least as much to the practice of the visual arts as the reverse. 38. G.

Even in South India, a trend has developed in the past twenty-five years toward establishing degree-granting schools after the Western model to train students in the traditional visual arts. The most prominent of these schools is the Govern- ment School of Architecture and Sculpture at Mamallapuram under the direc- torship of Ganapati Sthapati, who is one of the most widely respected of the traditional temple architects in South India. Most of the students belong to the caste of hereditary artists. Such schools notwithstanding, it is still possible to observe the direct transmission of local artistic traditions from father to son in many places in South India. Even the sons of traditional artists who receive degrees in the government art schools often return home to work for their fathers and continue their education as apprentices. 55.
