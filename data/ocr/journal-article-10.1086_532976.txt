 best practitioners, such as Bruni, Scaliger, Justus Lip- 
 sius, and Richard Bentley, it engaged fully with "na- 
 ture," praxis, politics, or social life. Secondly, a vibrant 
 community of scholars, Europe's "Republic of Let- 
 ters," kept up an intense discourse by means of 
 publication and private correspondence, and Latin was 
 their common language. Hence the intellectual 
 achievements of the age were, in a sense, a collective 
 production. 
 The two essays, "Civic Humanism and Scientific 
 Scholarship at Leiden" and "Those Humanists," high- 
 light the influence of learned communities on the 
 intellectual labor of individuals. The first treats Lipsius 
 and Scaliger in the context of the international Uni- 
 versity of Leiden. The second, a review of Anne 
 Goldgar's Impolite Learning: Conduct and Community 
 in the Republic of Letters, 1680-1750 (1995), examines 
 the editorial side of the learned-book trade in the late 
 seventeenth century, looking especially at the large 
 numbers of contact men and correctors involved in the 
 production of scholarly books. In "Jean Hardouin: The 
 Antiquary as Pariah," we find Hardouin taking philol- 
 ogy and antiquarianism to fanatical extremes and 
 rejecting much of classical literature as the spurious 
 concoction of an "impious" coterie, only to be de- 
 nounced by the scholarly community's saner heads. 
 From its very beginnings as a journey of discovery, 
 philological humanism could be free and "creative" in 
 its use of classical sources. In his famous De re 
 aedificatoria, finished in the 1430s, Leon Battista Al- 
 berti was already critical of Vitruvius, his major source. 
 Over the course of the fifteenth and sixteenth centu- 
 ries, establishing the topography of ancient Rome was 
 the work of many humanists who explored texts, did 
 some of the digging, read and compiled inscriptions, 
 and scrutinized artefacts. But the seventeenth century 
 brought the revolt of the new science against the 
 "dead" study of the past; now nature and the surround- 
 ing world beckoned. Grafton, however, has no trouble 
 showing that humanism was still charged with fierce 
 energy and innovation, in "the systematic effort to 
 reconstruct the institutions and mores, religions and 
 rituals of the Greek and Roman world" (p. 115). The 
 "Polyhistors" of his chapter nine, relying on a mastery 
 of classical rhetoric, went even further: they sought to 
 survey the whole of knowledge by means of an under- 
 standing of structures, classification, and study of the 
 different spheres of learning. Was their enterprise 
 serious? Leibnitz himself pursued it. 
 The author's skills are sharply displayed in his study 
 of the reception accorded to part of Petronius's frag- 
 mented Satyricon (chapter eleven), which went from 
 being seen as a forgery, because of its flagrant sole- 
 cisms, to its complete acceptance by a more sophisti- 
 cated seventeenth-century philology. Interestingly, one 
 of the keys to its acceptance lay in the new sense of the 
 ways in which Europe's vernacular literatures were 
 developing. Grafton's concluding studies-"Profiles" 
 of Lipsius, Descartes, Giambattista Vico, and the 
 nineteenth-century classicist Jacob Bernays-also ex- 
  
  
 hibit his imaginative verve. Lipsius, for example, striv- 
 ing to move beyond his brilliant editions of Tacitus and 
 Seneca, was so concerned to demonstrate the practical 
 utility of classical learning-as in his writings on a 
 science of politics and on Rome's arms and armies- 
 that he verged on sacrificing a firmer knowledge of the 
 past to a policy of instrumentalizing it. But most 
 ingenius, perhaps, is the take on "Descartes the 
 Dreamer" (chapter thirteen), which identifies a strik- 
 ing link between the philosopher's grounding in clas- 
 sical rhetoric and Ignatius Loyola's Spiritual Exercises 
 on the one hand, and, on the other, his individualistic 
 resolution to write off all past philosophy in the name 
 of a rational system based on his own perceptions. 
 Descartes is here freshly anchored in his time and 
 place. 
 All told, these studies add up to a sparkling perfor- 
 mance for readers from across the spectrum of histor- 
 ical and literary scholarship.

 God's Two Books: Copernican 
 Cosmology and Biblical Interpretation in Early Modern 
 Science. Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame 
 Press. 2002. Pp. viii, 319. $39.95. 
 In 1616, the Holy Office of the Roman Inquisition 
 announced its judgment of the system of the universe 
 published by Nicholas Copernicus in 1543. In a ringing 
 endorsement of the unity of knowledge, it condemned 
 the doctrines that the sun rests and the earth moves as 
 formally heretical because they were contrary to scrip- 
 ture, and absurd or rash in philosophy because op- 
 posed to Aristotelian cosmology. Kenneth J. Howell 
 provides a fine survey of ways in which early modern 
 thinkers held their faiths and philosophies together 
 against the challenges of Copernicanism. 
 Howell stresses that the problem of reconciliation 
 hit hardest those who interpreted biblical accounts and 
 astronomical systems realistically: an obvious point, 
 but worth signaling because respectable epistemolo- 
 gies then existed for compartmentalizing knowledge. 
 Exegetes who practiced the technique of accommoda- 
 tion (interpreting awkward passages, like those in 
 which God walks and talks, as fictions accommodated 
 to rude understandings) could explain Joshua's order 
 to the sun to stop as more suited to the philosophical 
 attainments of his people than the correct Copernican 
 command, "Earth stand Thou still." Symmetrically, 
 Aristotelians often found it convenient to dismiss the 
 details of planetary motions that disagreed with their 
 cosmology as mere mathematics, useful for describing 
 appearances but not for founding a philosophy. 
 Realists on either side could use the exegetical 
 technique employed by the other to clear objections to 
 their point of view. Thus the Catholic Galileo Galilei 
 urged the theologians of the Holy Office to interpret 
 all scriptural passages appearing to confirm the quies-

 cence of the earth and the motion of the sun as 
 concessions to ignorance, and the Protestant contro- 
 versialist Andreas Osiander, who saw Copernicus's 
 book through the press, contributed to it an unsigned 
 preface warning readers against seeking truth in as- 
 tronomy, "lest you go away from this book a greater 
 fool than when you came to it." 
 Howell's contribution is an analysis of the positions 
 of moderate realists who sought solid principles on 
 which to unify their knowledge and beliefs. Many of 
 them tried to buttress and refine their natural philos- 
 ophy by reference to scripture. Howell points to Tycho 
 Brahe and Johannes Kepler. Brahe worked out a 
 compromise so adroit that the Jesuits adopted it: by 
 placing all the planets in motion around the sun, and 
 the sun (and moon) in orbit around the stationary 
 earth, Tycho had a system with most of the advantages 
 of Copernicus's and many fewer openings for the 
 literal scripturalist or dogmatic Aristotelian. As for 
 Kepler, his numerological expressions of his belief in a 
 triune God and a world created by weight, number, 
 and measure inspired him to find mathematical rela- 
 tions that, in Isaac Newton's hands, would underpin a 
 new world view. 
 These examples concern the protagonists of the 
 scientific revolution. Howell has looked at secondary 
 actors as well; for example, on the Protestant side were 
 the mathematician Georg Joachim Rheticus, who 
 helped pry Copernicus's manuscript from him, and 
 Christoph Wittich, who professed Cartesian cosmology 
 in the Netherlands. Rheticus upheld creation but 
 otherwise found nothing in scripture, properly con- 
 strued, to constrain his cosmology. Wittich wrote 
 widely and subtly about accommodation and ended 
 with a double fragmentation of knowledge: scripture 
 and natural science differ both in content and in 
 method, the one concerned with salvation and sense 
 perception, the other with reason and natural knowl- 
 edge. On the Catholic side, Howell discusses Libert 
 Froidmont, professor of theology in Louvain and the 
 successor of Cornelius Jansen, and the maverick Do- 
 minican Tommaso Campanella, who refined his epis- 
 temology as a prisoner of the Inquisition. Froidmont 
 applied accommodation to God's anthropomorphic 
 attributes but not to cosmology: had Joshua been a 
 Copernican, he would have issued his command to the 
 earth. Joshua was not a Copernican; Froidmont would 
 not be one either. In contrast, Campanella undertook 
 to improve the fit between natural philosophy and 
 theology begun by St. Thomas Aquinas. An apparently 
 patent passage in Deuteronomy links the sun, moon, 
 mountains, and hills (Deut. 33:13-15). Campanella 
 applied Galileo's discovery of mountains in the moon 
 to find a deeper meaning in the text and to censure the 
 theologians who had censured Galileo: "after so many 
 centuries he vindicates the Scriptures from ridicule 
 and distortion by observable evidence." 
 For Brahe and Kepler, the desire to preserve old 
 scripture and embrace new philosophy was a source of 
 creativity in natural science. Wittich found the combi- 
  
  
 nation untenable and compartmentalized his truths. 
 Froidmont, who had inclined toward Copernicus's 
 ideas before the Holy Office's ruling of 1616, preferred 
 dogmatism to relativism. Rheticus, Campanella, and 
 the many others Howell treats complete his demon- 
 stration that the usual dichotomy drawn between 
 friends and foes of Copernicus does not do justice to 
 the inventiveness of the human mind.

 Alcohol, Sex, and Gender in Late 
 Medieval and Early Modern Europe. (Early Modern 
 History: Society and Culture.) New York: Palgrave. 
 2001. Pp. x, 200. 
 A. Lynn Martin documents and interrelates the sexual 
 double standard and the drinking double standard in 
 England, France, and Italy from 1300 to 1700. Premod- 
 ern Europeans expected women to preserve chastity 
 and secondarily sobriety. His book provides abundant 
 evidence that men were more in need of the prescrip- 
 tion for sobriety. Martin judiciously examines studies 
 of household accounts and statistical charts of drinking 
 consumption, yet concludes that inebriation was a 
 common popular condition in premodern Europe. 
 While women brewed much of the ale, with the 
 dominance of beer in the sixteenth century, male 
 brewing became more dominant. The daily lives of 
 women,.as well as of men, included ale and beer 
 drinking in the north and wine drinking in the south. 
 Martin argues that premodern Europe was more 
 heavily inebriated than modern Europe; and while 
 anecdotes of disorderly behavior fill his book, his 
 overall view is that male and female alcohol consump- 
 tion led to "social integration and jollification" (p. 
 118). He portrays a world where alcohol marked 
 lifecycle events and civic and religious ritual, served as 
 a pharmacy and as source of nourishment, and con- 
 tributed to the integration of social groups. He might 
 have discussed the Catholic Church limiting the wine 
 during the Eucharist to the priesthood, and the Hus- 
 site to Protestant sharing of the wine with the laity. He 
 does discuss the Puritan disapproval of alehouses. 
 In most of his chapters, Martin's sources are pre- 
 scriptive literature and fictional sources, as well as 
 court cases. He includes women authors Christine de 
 Pizan, Margery Kempe, Marguerite de Navarre, and 
 Madame de Sevign6 and is careful to indicate that 
 most of the time he is documenting men's views and 
 expectations. In particular, Martin elaborates the pop- 
 ular images of drunken men and drunken women: the 
 man as either violent and sexually aggressive or impo- 
 tent in a stupor, and the woman as unruly or promis- 
 cuous. Men perceived men drinking as forging bonds 
 of identity and solidarity and women drinking as 
 encouraging insubordination to men. Male stereotypes 
 of unruly women included the gossiper, the scold, the 
 infant-killer, and the witch. With regard to images of
