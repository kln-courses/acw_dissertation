PATERSON Department ofSociology and Anthropology West Virginia University Although there is general agreement that the Upper Paleolithic images of hu- mans (anthropomorphs) portrayed on the walls of many European caves are rel- atively rare, there is disagreement on what counts as a "real" anthropomorph. While differing numbers and identifica- tions are found in the literature (Ucko and Rosenfeld 1972; Ripoll-Perello 1958; Kiihn 1936; Saccasyn-Della Santa 1947), counts of reported anthropomorphs from Leroi-Gourhan (1967:503), Naber (1976), and L'Art des Cavernes (Ministare de la Culture 1984) indicate they are only 3-4% of the total animal (including hu- man) images on cave walls. The meaning ofanthropomorphs is also elusive. Leroi- Gourhan (1982:51) suggests that "the fig- ures of humans have not yet yielded much information on their role in the paleolithic message .... [Explanations for human figures] are based solely on the reminis- cence of western thought." This research will explore the interrelationships among anthropomorphs, animal art, and archeo- fauna in an attempt to explain the role of these human images in that elusive "'pa- leolithic message." The Data Base To acquire a data base for the study of anthropomorphs, a photocopy or tracing was made of every human image reported in the literature as being portrayed on a cave wall in western Europe that can be dated reasonably as Upper Paleolithic, spanning from 35,000 to 10,000 years BP.' Because dating of parietal art is ten- uous at best (Straus 1982:71), the por- trayals are not treated chronologically but as a single unit. Since the context in which human figures are portrayed is an important aspect of this research, all por- table human figures that are sculpted (Ve- nuses), or engraved on bone tools, plaques, or cobbles, are purposely omit- ted from the study, since their portability suggests they were not necessarily found where artists originally intended them to be.2 In addition, lines or strokes that have been interpreted by some to be sexual symbols are not included, as their status as anthropomorphs is particularly sub- jective. Forty-four caves in western Europe contain a total of 217 images for which anthropomorph status has been reported. Geographically, the caves range from southern Spain to northeastern France, a span of some 1,300 km. While some geo- graphic regions have more caves with hu- man images than other regions, in general wherever there is cave art there are an- thropomorphs. Overall, one of every five caves has at least one reported human im- age, with the number per cave ranging from 0-33; only five caves have more than ten reported anthropomorphs, but with the exception of Marsoulas-where re- ported anthropomorphs are 31% of the art-humans are rare relative to animal images. Once all reported anthropomorphs were located in the literature, the initial problem was to eliminate those reported anthropomorphs that are unlikely to be human images. An anthropomorph is de- fined as an image whose visible traits are specifically human, or at least partially human, and not totally animal. By re- stricting anthropomorphs to those show- ing specific or generalized human traits, Ucko and Rosenfeld (1972:155-156) re- duced the number of reported anthropo- morphs in their data set from 180 to 106. 664</page><page sequence="2">RESEARCH REPORTS 665 Since the human images in the Ucko and Rosenfeld data set were not individ- ually identified, each of the reported 217 anthropomorphs was assessed for inclu- sion in this data set, using a variation of the Ucko and Rosenfeld criteria.3 This re- sulted in dismissing 101 of the reported anthropomorphs and retaining a total of 116, which reduced the number of caves with anthropomorphs from 44 to 32. In- terestingly, the final number in this data set is not unlike that reported by Ucko and Rosenfeld, although there is no guar- antee the samples are identical. Figure 1 shows the geographical distribution of the final sample of anthropomorphs. This research focuses on four main questions. First, what can be learned by examining the distribution of anthropo- morphs: (1) in general, (2) in relation to the human fossil record in the same geo- graphic areas, (3) in comparison with the distribution of animal art portrayed in the same caves, and (4) in comparison with the archeofaunal record of nonhuman an- imals? Second, what can be learned by examining the nature of the anthropo- morphs themselves: (1) their gender, if assessable, (2) any activity being por- trayed, and (3) the nature of the "other species," if the human image is assessed as a hybrid or as masked? Third, what can be learned by examining the larger art context in which anthropomorphs are found: (1) to what extent are humans por- trayed alone, away from other images, and (2) if other portrayals are near, what species tend to be "nearest" to the an- thropomorphs, and what might such as- sociations mean? Fourth, does anything associated with the art-style, media, technique-aid in understanding the likely intent of the artists? In all of these questions, an assumption is made that the artists' portrayals were intentional, non- random behaviors. Findings The Regional Distribution ofAnthropomorphs The distribution of the anthropo- morphs in this sample is shown in Table 1 in relation to the total art counts and ar- cheofauna (PI Index)4 for the six major animal species in the art: reindeer, horse, bovine, deer, ibex, and mammoth5 (see Rice and Paterson 1985, 1986). Each re- gion represents one of the ten sub-wa- tershed areas of the Garonne-Dordogne river in southwestern France (numbered 1-10) or one of the four geographic areas in Cantabrian Spain (lettered FW to E). The data represent the entire Upper Pa- leolithic. The human fossil data use MNI (Minimum Number of Individuals) val- ues, and are thus exact counts. There is a highly significant correlation between the number of reported anthropomorphs and the total number of animal portrayals (r = .89, p &lt; .00002) across the 14 regions of France and Spain. The human fossil and archeofaunal data in these regions are also significantly correlated (r = .48, p &lt; .04, one-tail test), but as the animal bone data in Table 1 are reported in a Prevalence Index, not in MNI values, the data are only roughly comparable. The number of human fossils is also signifi- cantly correlated (r = .38), with the num- ber of human portrayals using data from the 24 regions of France and Spain, in- cluding the ten regions listed as "other" in Table 1. In sum, the relationship be- tween the amount of human and animal art is stronger than either the relationship between human and animal bones, or that between human art and human fossils. Anthropomorph Characteristics Table 2 provides cave-by-cave data on anthropomorph traits: assessed gender, masked or hybrid status, and action. Also identified are the species portrayed near- est each target anthropomorph within ap- proximately 1 m. Based on assessments of gender traits (e.g., penis, beard, mus- tache, breast, vulva), and in a few cases on general appearance, 67 of the 116 hu- man images could be assessed by gender: 52 (78%) as male and 15 (22%) as fe- male. Assessments are more difficult to make when trying to determine the intended ac- tion of human images. Artists apparently were not overly concerned with realistic placement of images, as some are shown upside down or "standing on their noses."

Note that the behaviors of the last two fig- ures are most easily interpreted in the context of other portrayals (the musk ox and the bovine).6 When cross-tabulating assessed gender and behavior, all of the walking, running, or "dancing" anthropomorphs that could be assigned a gender (N = 15) are male. Of the standing anthropomorphs that could be assigned a gender (N = 18), nine are male and nine are female. All three of the speared images are male; all six prone figures are female; the figures being charged and brandishing an object are both male; and one sitting anthropo- morph is male. In summary, only males are shown in an active mode (or as vic- tims); females are always portrayed as in- active (standing or lying prone). Many of the anthropomorphs in the sample appear to be wearing animal masks; others appear to be part human, part animal (hybrid). Experts disagree on whether particular images should be called masked or hybrid, and on the na- ture of the "other" species represented. Twenty-five human images were judged in this research as being masked; two im- ages were judged to be hybrids.

If Table 3 is collapsed by combining all the "actives" and "inactives" (ignoring masked/hybrid status), the resulting 2 x 2 table gives a chi square of 16.06 (df = 1),p &lt; .00006, which means that this gen- der pattern could have occurred by chance only 6 times in 100,000! The Context of the Anthropomorph Art A cave-by-cave analysis was done to determine if the anthropomorphs were described as near or superimposed upon any particular species of animal or an- other human image (see Table 2). The species of the figure nearest to each an- thropomorph was recorded, if within 1 m.8 Nonfaunal art was not considered. There are only six cases where anthropo- morphs appear "alone" with no other hu- man or animal portrayals nearby. For the remaining anthropomorphs, the proba- bility of a particular species (animal or human) being nearest the target anthro- pomorph was calculated based on the fre- quencies of human and animal portrayals in that cave. In most cases, the probabil- ity of a specific species being portrayed nearest a target anthropomorph would be classified as a chance event given the im- ages found in that cave. Overall, the most common "nearest" portrayals are of other anthropomorphs (N = 39),9 fol- lowed by horses (N = 32) and bovines (N = 19), the two animal species most fre- quently portrayed in cave art. Other "nearest" species are nine deer, four ibex, two mammoth, one or two musk oxen, and two boar. It is intriguing that boars and musk oxen show up as "nearest" por- trayals (the boars in Altamira and the musk oxen in Roc-de-Sers and perhaps in Pech-Merle), as these species are very un- likely to be found in cave art at all. Of the 2,657 animal images found in the 32 caves used in this study, only two boars and one or two musk oxen are reported, and yet all of these images appear as the species nearest a human image. All of the assess- able humans portrayed near the rare boars and musk oxen are male; two are masked. There are ten cases where the nearest species portrayals have a probability of less than 5 in 100 (p &lt; .05) of occurring by chance: in three of these cases, the un- likely images are of animals (deer or boar); in the other seven cases, they are of other anthropomorphs. Table 4 lists all of these unlikely cases. It is interesting that all caves with five or more anthropo- morphs are on this table except Marsou- las (where the probability of the six near- est anthropomorph portrayals isp = .07). In six of the seven cases in Table 4, those nearest anthropomorph images are so statistically unlikely that they would be expected no more than five times in 1,000 (p &lt; .005). Such results strongly suggest that the artists intended to portray humans in groups. There is also evidence for anthropo- morph groupings to be of only one gen- der, especially for females. While only 10 of the 52 male figures have another hu- man image as the nearest figure, 12 of the 15 females are portrayed near other (fe- male) anthropomorphs. Of the 25 caves where some figures can be assessed by gender, only females are portrayed in four Table 3 Cross-classification of all anthropomorphs that could be assessed by gender, behavior, and masked (or hybrid) status.

Even in the three caves where both genders are portrayed, anthropomorphs are not shown in mixed-gender groups; only at Les Combarelles are the two genders lo- cated as close as 5 m.1o Further analysis of female groups shows females in the same cave to be of the same general age. All three age groupings are found: young, middle-aged, and old. The three females in Les Combarelles are assessed as "young," the two at Magdeleine and the three at Roc-Aux-Sorcerer as "middle- aged," and the four at Pech-Merle as "old." (See Rice 1981 for age assessment methods.) Interestingly, there are no pregnant females represented. The Media and Style Of the anthropomorphs 70% are en- graved, while 30% are painted in black or red. While male images are both en- graved and/or painted, females are al- ways engraved. Unlike animals that are usually shown in a realistic manner, hu- mans are more likely to be stylistically rendered." Those anthropomorphs de- scribed as "stick figures" are usually painted and likely to depict action, and, when gender can be assessed, all are male. In Pileta, both stick and rounded male figures are found. Summary of Findings The summary profile that emerges from the empirical assessment of the an- thropomorphs is as follows: 1. Anthropomorphs, although less common than most animal species in cave art, are distributed among caves in a manner highly correlated with the fre- quency of animal portrayals. The distri- bution of human images in French and Spanish caves is also significantly corre- lated with the distribution of human fos- sils. 2. Anthropomorphs are rarely por- trayed alone: only 6 of the 116 figures have no other human or animal figure within 1 m. Most frequently, anthropo- morphs are portrayed near animal spe- cies (about two-thirds of the time) or near other human figures (about one-third of the time). Human groupings, to the ex- tent that they can be assessed, are always composed of same-gender members.</page><page sequence="8">RESEARCH REPORTS 671 3. Both males and females are por- trayed in the art, but with important dif- ferences. Females are seldom portrayed alone, are most commonly in groupings, are never painted or rendered as stick fig- ures, are always engraved, are never masked or hybrids, are always inactive, and are never near rare animal species. By contrast, males are shown both alone and in same-gender groups, but more commonly alone, can be painted or en- graved, and may be rendered as stick fig- ures. Males are often portrayed as masked or hybrids, are either active or passive, and are unexpectedly found near rare species. 4. When the nearest "other" figure to each target anthropomorph is examined, the most likely nearest figure is another anthropomorph, which is surprising, given the relatively few anthropomorphs in the art. When the nearest figure is an animal, it is most likely to be one of the more frequently portrayed species, espe- cially horse or bovines, although two very rarely portrayed species-musk ox and boar-also show up near human figures. Discussion Given these summary data, what con- clusions can be drawn about the place of anthropomorph portrayals in Upper Pa- leolithic life? We suggest the following conclusions are empirically supported: 1. Cave artists were much more inter- ested in portraying animals than them- selves. The focus on animals is apparent in the much larger number of animal ver- sus human images as well as in the higher quality of artistic treatment given to ani- mal portrayals. Animals likely were a fo- cus of concern because of their impor- tance to the survival of the entire human community.12 2. When humans were portrayed, they were frequently (one-third of the time) shown in the company of other humans, suggesting cave artists were clearly con- scious of their species' tendency to form groups. There is no evidence in parietal art that individual human portraits (male or female) were intended. Males, how- ever, were more often portrayed near an- imals, not other humans, suggesting the deliberate depiction of hunting-related activities, perhaps to recognize hunting feats on those occasions when large groups of humans aggregated and cele- brated special events (Hammond 1974; Conkey 1980; Bahn 1982). 3. Comparisons of animal and human portrayals by cave also turned up an un- expected relationship: the number of an- thropomorphs per cave was found to be significantly correlated (r = .50, p &lt; .001) with the number of portrayed fe- lines and/or bears per cave (even though none is a "nearest" image).'" Curiously, the number of anthropomorphs is not sig- nificantly correlated with the number of images of any other animal species, in- cluding other rare animals such as boar, musk oxen, or rhinoceros. However, as there are felines and/or bears in only 11 of the 32 caves in this sample (all but three in France), this finding may be an anom- aly. Across France and Spain generally, feline and bear portrayals are equally likely to be in caves with or without an- thropomorphs. Two patterns have thus been found be- tween human and rare animal images: (1) the tendency for musk ox and boar to be portrayed "nearest" male anthropo- morphs, and (2) the tendency for the number of images of feline and bear to be associated with the number of human im- ages-an association found with no other species. The first finding is consistent with the familiar hunting theme, with the art perhaps demonstrating how rare spe- cies were or should be hunted. The sec- ond finding would have different impli- cations. Given their relative rarity in liv- ing site archeofauna (and never being "nearest" portrayals), it is unlikely that felines or bears were important as food re- sources. But, like humans, both were cave dwellers. The association of human por- trayals with these two animals suggests the purpose of the bear and feline por- trayals may have been symbolic rather than economic. 4. Differences in the art itself lead to more questions than answers. What could account for the cluster of details that include the fact that females are al-</page><page sequence="9">672 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [90, 1988] ways engraved, while males are both painted and engraved, or that stick fig- ures are likely to be male, painted, and showing action?'4 If painting is easier than engraving, and stick figures quicker to draw than rounded figures, one partial explanation may be that the purpose of painted and stick figures was for fast com- munication, perhaps about hunts. In- struction of the young or quick recounting of hunting events both would fit the data. 5. Previous research (Hammond 1974; Rice and Paterson 1985, 1986) provided empirical evidence to tie animal portrayals to the subsistence patterns of Upper Pa- leolithic people. The new data on anthro- pomorphs are fully consistent with the previous findings, but add the important element of the human community. Since the core of Upper Paleolithic life likely re- volved around hunting, the bulk of the art predictably is of hunted animals, and the majority of the anthropomorphs are in- dividual males portrayed near commonly hunted species. Where rare (and danger- ous) musk oxen and boars are portrayed, there too male portrayals are close by, perhaps signifying the rarity of human contact with those species. Both ordinary and extraordinary hunting events appear to be portrayed in cave art. Cave artists also portrayed themselves in social groupings. Females, especially, are portrayed in passive social groupings, their economic activities apparently not depicted in cave art. For neither males nor females is there evidence in parietal art of individual portraits: the crude ren- derings of humans preclude individual identification. It is group memberships, most often by gender but also by age for females, not individual identities, that are portrayed. Cumulatively, the cave art itself reveals a portrait consistent with our 20th-cen- tury understanding of Upper Paleolithic life-a life in which both females and males participated, where economic ac- tivities were often gender-segregated, and where special attention was given to male hunting activities in the parietal art. That "elusive paleolithic message" becomes a bit clearer. Notes Acknowledgments. The data collection seg- ment of this research was supported by a West Virginia University Senate Grant.

Portable human figures are presently undergoing separate analysis. 3First, a list was made of specific human traits: presence of long legs, bipedal posture, flat face, human-appearing hands and feet, collarbone, shoulders, frontal eyes, and specif- ically human gender traits. In addition, a list of nonhuman traits was used to separate hu- man from nonhuman images: presence of tail, fur, beak, muzzle-like face, and antlers. These two lists provided criteria for inclusion and elimination of anthropomorphs. Initially, if the total number of human traits was larger than the total of nonhuman traits, that anthro- pomorph was retained in the data set. If the portrayal did not allow for an assessment of a trait, no assessment was made. On this basis, 112 anthropomorphs had more human than nonhuman traits and 105 had more nonhu- man than human traits. In a subsequent as- sessment of each human image on its general appearance, 68 were judged to be human, 46 were judged as possibly human, and 103 were judged to be nonhuman images. In most cases, the general and the specific trait assess- ments were the same. Provisionally, the 114 images identified as possible anthropomorphs by either assessment were retained in the data set. These initial assessments were made by the first author. To minimize personal subjectivity, 36 stu- dents, who were not specialists in art but who were in a class on primitive art taught by the first author, individually assessed 202 anthro- pomorphs. The assessment was done during the first week of class before students had an opportunity to be influenced, by the instruc- tor's perceptions. Photocopies or tracings of each anthropomorph were put on individual</page><page sequence="10">RESEARCH REPORTS 673 cards and students were given checksheets on which to indicate assessments by asking, "Do you believe the artist intended this figure to be human?" There was unanimous agreement on only 13 portrayals: 8 were intended to portray humans, and 5 were not. There was high agreement (more than 90%) that 19 addi- tional images were human and that 20 were not, leaving 150 images that ranged from 10- 90% agreement, pro or con. If at least 50% of the students agreed with the initial assessment of the first author, it was accepted; if at least 75% disagreed with the assessment, it was re- jected. Students and the first author also judged masked or hybrid status of the anthro- pomorphs. (Subsequent to these assessments, 15 additional human images were reported in the literature. After assessment by the first au- thor, three images were added to the data set.) 4The archeofaunal data are reported in a Prevalence Index (PI) that is a constructed in- dex (not bone counts) based on nominal, or- dinal, and/or interval level data as available from archeofaunal reports. See Rice and Pa- terson (1985) for a complete discussion. Bo- vines include both aurochs and bison. We have consistently combined the two species under the generic name, as they are difficult to distinguish in the archeofaunal record. 5While there is no unanimity among experts as to the species identification of some cave art animals (including anthropomorphs), where there is disagreement, we have followed the majority (see also footnote 6). 6Although there is current controversy over identification of any musk oxen in cave art, the curved horns particular to musk oxen are quite evident on the animal at Roc-de-Sers (Ministbre de la Culture 1984:579). Lemozi identifies a musk ox on the scraped ceiling at Pech-Merle as being nearest an "enigmatic figure" of a male (Ministire de la Culture 1984:471), although Breuil identifies the ani- mal as a bison (Sieveking and Sieveking 1962:117). Since we were unable to discover a photo of this animal, we are not confident of this association, and its association with the anthropomorph must remain provisional. Calculations were based on two musk oxen. There is also controversy as to whether there are any boars in cave art. The two boars from Altamira used in this study are identified as boars by most experts and the authors. 7The masks appear to portray ten birds, two turtles, and one each of ape, lion, "mammal," dog, and ibex; no assessment could be made on eight masks. 8An assessment of one anthropomorph's nearest portrayal is not possible (Altamira), as the figure has been "destroyed" (Ripoll-Per- ello 1958:179). 9If the entire set of reported anthropo- morphs is considered, the number of humans nearest other humans is increased three-fold. loPales and Saint Pereuse (1976:153-156) have also reported the tendency for male and female figures to be differentially located in caves: female figures more likely in areas of daylight and males more likely in total dark- ness. l Realism and stylism are both aspects of "style" in prehistoric art. In contrast to ani- mal images in cave art, human images are var- iously described as "stick figures," "crude and clumsy" (Ucko and Rosenfeld 1967:38), "de- formed" (Leroi-Gourhan 1982:51), or "in- complete" (Grand 1967:24). Whole segments of human figures are often missing, details are generally lacking, and individual traits are often exaggerated. They are generally ren- dered stylistically. While animal art shows some examples of exaggeration and missing segments as well, in general, animals are ren- dered realistically. 12See empirical evidence for this argument in Rice and Paterson (1985, 1986). 13Although the La Marche humans are not used in this study, the presence of humans and bears on the same slabs at that site is a tanta- lizing parallel to our finding. 14The painted, active, stick figure, male pattern is more true of Spain than France, suggesting possibly regional variation or a dif- ference in time periods.
