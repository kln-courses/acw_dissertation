Too often, one gets the feeling that some contemporary Irish poetry tries to advance itself into realms it has no business touring and by so doing elevate itself towards a more intellectual world view. Parnassus, they need reminding, was the abode of very earthy and even morally bankrupt gods and intellectual argument was not one of their entertainments. Patrick Kavanagh, famously, knew this. Lorca knew it. But in an era where poetry has become too often merely another tool in some personal advancement, where camps and cliques have turned the whole event of creating poetry into another branch of a literary industry, wherein winning obscure prizes is more important than writing a good poem and who you know is infinitely more important than whether you can write, finding poetry which is earthed in the real and ordinary is a small revelation. Thus does Liam Ryan's poetry renew the parched heart. Ryan, born in Tipperary in 1955, rates with the middle generation of poets: those between Heaney and the dreadful 'slam' exponents. In some ways it is an oddly lost generation, and one might have thought that it would have produced more politically and socially engaged poets than it has done; rather it has produced a cautious and three-monkeys kind of poetry, happier to identify itself epigraphically with universal or domestic suffering than to fight against it. But that is a meal for another day. This is Ryan's first collection, though the quality of the work presented here is such as to beg the question of why we have not heard more of him before now. He is an architect - the same training given to playwright and novelist, John Arden, incidentally - and not unnaturally he has a poem celebrating the calling and its ikons: His amazingly detailed houses squat, eaves stretched out against the heat, almost touching the massive trees; doorways invitingly hidden ... Frank Lloyd Wright's Oak Park The poem metastasises into a love poem, which gives it a sort of additional grandeur. Any poem about Wright could possibly have looked at the very 356 Studies volume 98 number 391</page><page sequence="3">Autumn 2009 : Book Reviews odd circumstances of the fire and murders at his home, Taliesin, at the start of the Great War, which themselves contain a sort of mythic fierceness. Not surprisingly, Filippo Brunelleschi, a Florentine goldsmith and sculptor whose first work as an architect was the magnificent dome of Santa Maria del Fiore, receives honourable mention; he was a mere advising onlooker in the design of the dome at Santa Maria Novella, not its designer nor builder, and one senses a little confusion here. Nonetheless there's a wonderful light-filled painterly quality to Brunelleschi's Dome: The Sunday evening in Florence, the sun low coming across the wide brown Arno lighting up the already golden bridge... Ryan's long sequential poem, Enamel Chippings, is a sort of family album, creating a small odyssey out of the ordinary comings and goings: After the Christmas I had the measles the toy cars already dismantled the balloons going soft in the kitchen a bottle of Fanta standing on the window. There is an argument that the lines and form here are too prosaic and that poetry has a sound, a music, to which it can and must aspire. It is not prose. But Ryan knows what poetry is and reminds us of this in his nod towards Antoine 6 Raifteiri's CHIAodain (a poem often sung to the air of The Bould Thady Quill) in his Rafferty's Mayo: Killaden is the town where everything grows, raspberries, strawberries, everything at its best; being there with my people banishes my sorrows and being with the drive of youth again I am blest Overall, this is a good and encouraging collection and one might hope not to wait quite as long for another. Noel King's Doghouse Press gives the lie to any stuffy notions about the chief poetry publishers residing within the Pale; though lamentably, when it comes to funding, the cyclopean Arts Council seem not to be able to bring themselves to view that part of the island out of reach of the DART. Studies volume 97 number 383 357</page><page sequence="4">Autumn 2009 : Book Reviews Many years ago I met briefly, poet and cleric, the late R.S.Thomas, a curmudgeonly soul, who had been brought to poetic prominence reluctantly and whose work reflected so unsparingly the Welsh darklands. I think rather I encountered him. It was in a Galway pub. I had been tempted to ask whether one feels a contradiction or a clash in being both cleric and poet, even though clearly the examples of John Skelton, John Donne, Gerard Manley Hopkins and George Herbert, to name a few, should have provided the answer. In the ancient world a priest was of necessity a poet also. If God and Muse have already shaken hands over the issue, then the question is moot. But this is simplistic reasoning. To what do religious turn when they seek insipiration to create poetry? If God is present in Thomas, His is a tough and almost unmentionable presence, and the poets cannot interpret Him: Christmas Eve! Five hundred poets waited, pen poised above paper, for the poem to arrive, bells ringing. It was because the chimney was too small, because they had ceased to believe, the poem passed them by on its way out... Nativity (1992) Thomas, an unforgiving realist, seems to suggest that poetry fails where imagination or faith might win out. So the question remains as to where the poet-priest places his faith when confronted with the notion of creating poetry. What does one get with Brother David Hodges, a Cistercian monk at Caldey Island, Wales, who has been a practising lawyer and read law at Cambridge? This is Hodges' fifth collection and it is billed on the back cover as 'reflecting the monastic life of prayer in an island setting,' which line alone might have deterred Thomas. But so much for jacket blurbs. The poetry here has more in common with Thomas' rough meditations than one might at first expect. There is something of him in the exquisitely frail and human litany expressed in The Old Priory. 358 Studies volume 98 number 391</page><page sequence="5">Autumn 2009 : Book Reviews A sanctuary filled with prayer in every space, from cobbled floor to barrel-vaulted roof. Requests for prayer, on scraps of card and paper left stacked on altar and piscina, on every stand and ledge... Far from being in any sense removed from the world or from knowledge of it, Hodges sees its most violent aspects as being all too present and threatening, even in terms of the pagan world. And one might wonder, of course, how anyone who has practised as a lawyer could not have experienced the real world! I am reminded, in his From the Giant's Chair, of attending a street procession for the Feast of St. John in a Breton Village a couple of months ago, where, in the midst of old chant and song, two fighter aircraft from a nearby base flew thunderously low over the rooftops, a sound, in that solemn peace, as violently apocalyptic and intrusive as one could imagine: .. .the height and distance pull the soul, until the peace is rudely broken by Jaguar strike planes snaking through his lair below. The 'his' in this case is the pagan Welsh giant, Idris. Hodges offers us, gently and without argument, a God-in-the-world experience, where the sacred is in the everyday and in the ordinary. This, conversely, permits us to see his evocative and often quite stunning poems as prayer, which perhaps answers part of the dilemma. When a poet composes a poem, is he praying? The answer must lie in the affirmative, whether he prays against war or offers a threnody to daffodils - or, indeed, whether he cares. Not surprising, then, that Hodges, like any true poet, takes a distinctly paganistic anthropomorphism for granted: Rhubarb curls and flaps its ears, gurgles with pleasure. Parsley is frisky like a lamb,.. . Summer Watering. Studies volume 97 number 383 359</page><page sequence="6">Autumn 2009 : Book Reviews When the poet turns to more immediately recognisable Christian themes, they are of their nature extensions of his spiritual experience as a counterpoint. Crucifixion is as close to common-or-garden prayer as we can imagine: "He thirsts for our/loving will/sets up His cross/within us,.." and this seemingly has little to do with the jets booming over the giant's chair. But one feels that it is merely the other side of the same mirror, that one experience reflects the other in a religious sensibility and that therefore one is justified in saying that, put simply, the religious experience is present in poetry. Many poets will acknowledge that, or strive, at a push, to acknowledge it. Hodges' poetry reminds us of it, at any rate. In doing so he comes perilously close to the thought of a poet like the late Kathleen Raine or, dare one suggest it, William Blake. The poet who imagines he is writing outside or ignoring of religious experience is like Thomas' five hundred poets, who wait to see something miraculous, but can not recognise it when it arrives.
