      <p>The recent publication of draft sequences of the human and chimpanzee genomes, spectacular new finds of hominid fossils, and the demonstration of “cultural traits” in free‐living chimpanzee communities have projected the study of nonhuman primates into international headlines. Although the comparative anatomy of primate body forms was an established area of research going back at least to Edward Tyson’s dissection of a chimpanzee in 1699, “primatology” is still a new science. The Yale anatomist Theodore Cedric Ruch is generally held to have coined the term only in about 1941. During the early decades of the twentieth century, before a unified field of primatology had emerged, its concerns were pursued by physical anthropologists, anatomists, embryologists, and zoologists. Introducing their preoccupation with typological morphometric analysis and phylogenetic modeling, they often hindered rather than furthered the development of a comparative understanding of primate relationships.</p>
      <p>The Swiss‐American anthropologist Adolph Hans Schultz (1891–1976), whose life and work is the subject of N. J. Chaoui’s Zurich doctoral dissertation, was a prominent figure in the institutionalization of primatological research, although his conservative and mistaken model of primate phylogeny remained unchanged well into the 1950s (pp. 163, 168). Joining the Embryological Research Laboratory of the Carnegie Institute in 1916, he was appointed the first professor of physical anthropology at the Medical School of the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in 1925. Until his return to Switzerland in 1951, Schultz not only served as an intellectual middleman between European and American anthropologists but also helped to found the American Association of Physical Anthropologists in 1928; he became its second president in 1932. Although he was a prolific writer of research papers, Schultz summarized his findings in only two books of a general nature. He did, however, distinguish himself as an organizer of science. Apart from the extensive collections and research laboratories that he founded in Baltimore and Zurich, he made physical anthropology and primatology a special concern of the Wenner‐Gren Foundation from 1946 on, edited a multivolume international handbook of primatology (<italic>Primatologia</italic>) in 1956–1957, and became the first vice president of the International Primatological Society in 1964.</p>
      <p>Firmly rooted in the academic conventions and colonialist attitudes of nineteenth‐century European anthropology, Schultz was a painstaking empiricist with a mania for collecting as many specimens as possible. There is no doubt that his debt to the biometric method developed by Paul Broca (1824–1880) and his own teacher, Rudolf Martin (1864–1924), rather than his own erroneous phylogenetic convictions, was the source of his success as an organizer of science. He also had a sense for the anthropomorphic popularization of his subject, inviting journalists to exploit the sensational aspects of his research. It is not easy to synthesize so many different and contradictory facets of one personality within a cohesive text.</p>
      <p>Chaoui, whose research was supported in part by the Swiss National Fund, has drawn from a very wide selection of published and unpublished sources, particularly Schultz’s correspondence in the archives of the Zurich Anthropological Institute, the minutes of several nomination procedures for academic positions, and the Schultz files at the archives of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, as well as popular newspaper articles dating from 1925 to 1970. The chief value of her work must be seen as having brought these sources together for the first time; her bibliography of twenty‐seven pages is ample proof of the task accomplished.</p>
      <p>Given Schultz’s emphasis on empirical research and his denial of grand theories, Chaoui chose wisely in arranging the documentary material not as an illustration of Schultz’s development but, rather, as a “microhistorical case study” of the “structure and sphere of influence” of the Zurich school of physical anthropology—which, in the person of Schultz, bridged Continental and American physical anthropology before and after World War II. While Chaoui is convincing in arguing that Schultz’s strict application of the morphometric principles of the Zurich school helped him to find a home in America and to lend an appearance of coherence to a new field of study for which accepted general theories were still lacking, she is less persuasive in explaining his continuing success in America and what, finally, led him to return to Europe.</p>
      <p>Too many questions remain. Very often the author restricts her analysis to a retelling of the source materials she has read. I also miss a firm statement of Schultz’s lasting theoretical contributions to the emerging science of primatology, although the author extensively reviews various competing phylogenetic models (pp. 74–90). Several breaks in the chronological continuity of the text and nonstandard quotation styles make the reading cumbersome at times. Nonetheless, the specialist will be grateful for a brief overview of the sources available for this important phase in the history of physical anthropology and primatology.</p>
