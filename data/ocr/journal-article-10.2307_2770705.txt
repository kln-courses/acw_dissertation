<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIAL CAUSATION' FRANK H. KNIGHT Professor MacIver's book is more a philo- sophical discussion of the meaning of causa- tion, with reference to social phenomena, than an essay on scientific method, or even "methodology," in social science. What can be done in reviewing such a work, in a com- pass about one-twentieth that of the book itself, must be limited to indicating its gen- eral character and briefly discussing the au- thor's position on a few major issues. To be useful, one must necessarily be somewhat negative; and to be brief, one must be some- what dogmatic. The difficulties are rather especially great in the present case because of the unusual extent to which the reviewer finds himself in general agreement with the author's position and yet dissatisfied with its development and exposition, while recog- nizing the high intellectual and literary qual- ity of the book. It is likely that the major differences of viewpoint between the re- viewer and the author are connected with the reviewer's approaching the general prob- lem more from the standpoint of a social sci- ence other than sociology-namely, eco- nomic theory, which in its methodology re- sembles natural science of the theoretical and quantitative type, represented by me- chanics. The problem set by the title is, of course, to bring out what social causation has in common with causation in other fields of inquiry, and the important differences. Thus, the author's task calls for a survey of the whole field of knowledge and for an ef- fort to distinguish its main divisions, from the standpoint of the types of explanatory thinking involved. In the reviewer's thinking, the philosoph- ical issue in the interpretation of causality centers in the ambiguous and varying rela- tion between knower and known, or, in phil- osophical jargon, between "subject" and "object." That is, the difficulty in the anal- ysis of knowledge lies in the varying kinds and degrees of opposition or assimilation be- tween these two entities. At one extreme we have the direct self-knowledge of the in- dividual subject. Here the primary fact is assimilation or identity; and, while separa- tion and interrelationship are evidently in- volved in the knowing relation, they present a peculiar difficulty for discursive thought and linguistic expression. At the other ex- treme we have the matter-of-fact knowl- edge, through sense-perception, of the ex- ternal physical world of inert objects. Here the primary fact of common sense-espe- cially in the modern, scientifically sophisti- cated variety-is opposition between know- er and known. Yet philosophical analysis is forced to recognize that man is also a part of nature; and the superficial opposition also breaks down from the other side, for physi- cal objects have an ultimate kinship with mind. Between and around these two poles of thinking lie many complications and per- plexities. Of these, the most important cen- ter in the intermediate and ambiguous po- sition, for the individual knower, of other knowers, who have to be recognized as both objects and subjects, in a relationship which is fully as puzzling for the individual, though in a different way, as the relation between himself as knower and as known in his own self-consciousness. The crux of the difficul- ty here is that the individual must immedi- ately recognize, as soon as he begins to think seriously about it, that all knowledge is it- self "social"; it is based on intercommunica- tion between individuals, each of whom is both subject and object, both to himself and to all others in the thinking community in which knowledge has its being. Apart from society, we can perhaps conceive of I Boston: Ginn &amp; Co., I942.

Certainly, nei- ther would be "knowledge," to say nothing of understanding. It seems to the reviewer that the first, and perhaps the major, hiatus in Professor MacIver's treatment is his complete failure to confront this fact of the social character of knowledge. From this point of view, hu- man society is fundamentally intellectual activity. But modern thought cannot en- visage man in any aspect without being driven back to a genetic and evolutionary view; and, from this standpoint, overt ac- tion is unquestionably prior to thinking, both in social life and in that of the individ- ual. Our author fails completely (at least in this book) to give any explicit consideration to conduct, either individual or social, in its relation to thinking and knowledge. He does not mention the fact that in the animal kingdom, particularly in the "social" in- sects, we have empirical knowledge of so- ciety without thinking, as far as we know and must assume, while human association also is conscious only in part. In short, he ignores the functional significance of knowl- edge and thinking. Moreover, he has writ- ten a philosophical treatise without any ex- plicit reference to the great historical schools of thought in the field of his subject -pragmatism, positivism, and idealism, to mention only the major divisions and con- trasting positions. The result is, to this reader, confusing and difficult to interpret. To come to grips with causation as the principle of order in the object-matter of knowledge, we begin by confronting the re- lations between subjectivity and objectiv- ity, in the form of activity and passivity. This opposition enters into all interpreta- tion of persistence and change. The final impression of the book upon the reviewer is that of a kind of vain twisting and turning, almost a squirming, through four hundred pages, in an effort to "have it both ways," in the conception of reality. There is equal insistence that causality is an active princi- ple, and, on the other hand, upon concrete methods of problem-solving which are "sci- entific" in the sense of natural science as purely empirical, phenomenalistic, and posi- tivistic. The main criticism of the book is that the author sees both horns of this in- tellectual dilemma but fails to recognize it and to see that it has no real solution. The issue arises in connection with every type of subject matter, from physical science through psychology and sociology to the study of "values" in logic or epistemology, aesthetics, and morals. The author wrestles with it over a large part of the field, but he never makes clear either the issue itself or his own position toward it. Rather, he seems to take first one side and then the other, in bewildering confusion. In the mind of the reviewer the only tenable position is to rec- ognize that causality always has both as- pects; it is at once an empirical and a dy- namic concept. Yet the two principles are logically opposed, even antithetical, in meaning. The nearest we can come to a so- lution is through a kind of pragmatism. For "practical" purposes-and this includes the purposes of knowing as well as of acting- we must adopt the empirical, descriptive view; causality is a matter of discoverable and describable order in phenomena. But it is also true that this empirical or positive knowledge is never satisfying and that, fur- ther, we never really stop with generalized phenomenal description; in the discussion of any subject matter we always use interpre- tive principles of a nonempirical, metaphys- ical, more or less dynamic, character. This is conspicuously true in physical sci- ence, where the metaphysical principles in question take the form of "forces." (In mod- ern physics these are replaced by "field the- ory," running in terms of some conception of "hyperspace," which is even further from empirical knowledge than is the concept of force.) "Force" has bothered students and thinkers from the beginning of modern sci- ence, and they have struggled to get rid of it (on the principle of "Occam's Razor")</page><page sequence="3">48 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY and to use only equations of motion. But this simply cannot be done. Prerelativity physicists, notably Poincare, made it clear that a purely empirical mechanics is impos- sible. The conception of some kind of "real interaction" between physical bodies is in- dispensable to thought. The simplest me- chanical phenomenon-that of impact- cannot otherwise be pictured or thought of as real. Professor MacIver himself really ar- gues for this position, throughout chapter ii, and effectively criticizes such phenomenal- ists as Pearson, Russell, Cohen, Ogden, and Richards, and the sociologist Lundberg, as well as Hume, who "reduce" causation to uniformity or regularity of sequence (p. 63). But he himself remains ambiguous as well as halfhearted. He really comes out with the positivist position that causality is sim- ply "the ways of things" (an expression quoted from Montague), though the last section of the chapter insists upon the real- ity of the principle of causation as some- thing more than empirical sequence (or ac- companiment). MacIver's position is weak in his refusal frankly to recognize that the positivists are right in insisting that causality in this "real" sense is "anthropomorphic" or animistic, epithets which to the scientific mind are even more damning than "metaphysical." Men cannot think about anything in wholly unanthropomorphic terms. This is hardly a mystery. Long before the advent of Ward and Whitehead, Huxley pointed out in con- nection with Hume's example of the billiard balls that we cannot finally picture physical objects as real-as persistently and actively real-without reading into them some rudi- ment of mind, some kinship with ourselves. Pure existence cannot be thought of entirely without activity, and the only intelligible meaning of activity is that of will. If one is determined to have a "monistic" theory of reality (which to this reviewer is absurd as well as dogmatic), it must certainly be for- mulated in idealistic terms. The difficulty with this position is that if it is carried to its logical conclusion it results in solipsism, or perhaps in the sheer dogma of an "absolute" cosmic mind into which the reality neither of individual minds nor of "objects," as known to experience, can be fitted intelligi- bly. The ambiguity and untenability of Pro- fessor MacIver's position-or his lack of a position-come out in his repudiation of in- determinacy with reference to the Heisen- berg principle (p. 32), and most clearly in a long chapter on "Cause as Responsible Agent," where he comes nearest to confront- ing the fact of will (Part III, chap. viii). Here, while formally insisting on the nature of human beings as "dynamic participants" (p. 236) in the causal order and on the real- ity of the act of choice (p. 240), the sub- stance of the argument reduces to the con- ventional positivistic "explanation" of free- dom of choice as an illusion. The contradic- tion, or equivocation, is apparent through- out Parts III and IV, which present, respec- tively, the author's "Analytic Approach" and his "Interpretation." He argues nobly, effectively, and correctly for the reality of motives and for the necessity of taking them into account for the understanding of hu- man behavior and social phenomena. But the nearest he ever comes to interrelating the two factors, empirical uniformity and "real" cause, is in the presentation of a sharp antithesis between the physical and the so- cial realms. "The chain of physical causa- tion does not need mind except for its dis- covery. The chain of social causation needs mind for its existence" (p. 263). The antithesis is false in both its parts. Physical causation also ultimately needs mind, of a sort, to be "real"; and social causation does not need it and cannot use it for the purposes of "science," properly in- terpreted. The author presently adds: There is no point in seeking to apply to social systems the causal formula of classical me- chanics, to the effect that if you know the state of a system at any instant you can calculate mathematically, in terms of a system of co- ordinates, the state of that system at another time. We simply cannot use such a formula. It fits into another frame of reference.</page><page sequence="4">SOCIAL CA USA TION 49 But social "science," in so far as it goes be- yond mere taxonomy and attempts to ex- plain events and at the same time sticks to scientific concepts and methods, does use precisely this formula and no other. If it also recognizes conscious states or attitudes as a factor in its subject matter, these are treated as "epiphenomena," as simply "par- allel" to the empirical order, without adding anything to the latter, and as superfluous for scientific discussion. Motives in human behavior play the same role in discussion as forces in mechanics; they are essential for ultimate intelligible interpretation, and in this case we know them as directly and as certainly as we know physical objects; but they are supernumerary, for science itself is descriptive and analytical. As far as science is concerned, free will, which is the only real dynamism, is either an illusion or simply a methodological limitation. Social science should recognize this limitation and admit that it has nothing to say about it beyond recognizing its existence as a limitation upon regularity and its place in our interpretive thinking. In so far as the activities of will are to be made intelligible, it is the task of philosophy and, perhaps, of literature and art. However, the limitation due to freedom is relatively unimportant in a quantitative sense and with reference to any phase of so- cial phenomena which anyone would think of discussing in scientific terms, in sober, nonfigurative language. Free choice, based on genuine mental activity and not finally explicable in terms of antecedent conditions, is of very limited scope even in the individ- ual life, even though infinitely important. Its significance as a limitation of scientific treatment is greater the narrower the area within which one may be interested in "pre- dicting," i.e., describing, in terms of reliable and stable patterns of uniformity of coexist- ence and sequence. But, even in the nar- rowest range, factors which we must call "caprice"2 and "accident" are indubitably more important than will or free choice in setting limits to scientific generalization, though the two categories cannot be clearly distinguished. The great bulk of individual conduct, bodily and mental, must be con- formable to established patterns as a condi- tion of the individual's own effective func- tioning, specifically as a "free" individual; and this is more pronouncedly true of that part of his conduct which is properly called "social." For the most part, social phenom- ena come under the "laws" of physics and chemistry; of biology and psychology, in- cluding logic; and of anthropology, as the general science of culture. If we examine social phenomena and our knowledge about them, with a view to dis- covering the differences between social and natural science, as science, the major differ- ence will undoubtedly be found in the enor- mously greater role played by "history" in contrast with nonhistorical science. That is, the "independent variables" and the forms of their interrelations are to a vastly greater degree "functions of time"-of chronologi- cal as well as clock time-in comparison with the constant or recurrent features. Professor MacIver refers to history several times, particularly in section ii of chapter ix (from which we have quoted just above), which is entitled "The Special Case of the Social Sciences." He mentions "the unre- turning stream of history" (p. 256) and here and elsewhere stresses the "uniqueness of historical configurations." But what he is interested in is the limitations of the experi- mental method, and he nowhere discusses the relation between history and science, in the narrower meaning in which it contrasts with history, or the relation between social science (in this narrower meaning) and hu- man history. There are, of course, historical sciences dealing with nature, inanimate as well as animate; such are historical astronomy or cosmology, geology (in contrast with physi- cal geography), and evolutionary biology. But, when we speak of "science" without qualification or explanation, we naturally think of laboratory science or of statistical induction. The propositions of such sci- ences are hypothetical for the most part;</page><page sequence="5">50 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY they describe associative relations among phenomena or events, not phenomena or events as actual, at a particular point in space-time. They run in the form of "if this, then that"-or, correctly speaking, if "this" is present in a certain magnitude or degree, "that" is to be expected to accompany or follow in some corresponding magnitude or degree. Professor MacIver's weakness with respect to the quantitative aspect of science will call for notice presently, in another con- nection. Our point at the moment is simply that the historical character of social data presents a difference from natural science only in degree, and no difference in the ulti- mate meaning of scientific method. The propositions of history, natural or human, are also essentially "timeless," in the meta- physical sense, in so far as history itself is scientific. This quality of science, even when it describes irreversible changes and nonre- current sequences, is surely familiar to any- one who has made any serious study of the philosophy of science. It is often expressed by saying that, for science, time is essential- ly a spatial dimension. The philosophy of Bergson in particular centered around the contrast between such time-mere duration -and "real time." The latter, as Bergson also emphasized, is intelligible only in terms of will-really active or creative change. We have mentioned, as an important lim- itation of Professor Maclver's treatment, that he has so little to say about quantity and quantitative relations. This comes out particularly in his discussion of the notion of equilibrium and most specifically in his references to economics, which he uses as the main illustration of "error" in the use of the equilibrium concept (see especially chap. vi, sec. i, "Equilibrium and Precipitant"). The entire chapter, entitled "Cause as Pre- cipitant," shows a predilection for the "ro- mantic" view of causality, as centering in catastrophic events or discontinuities, and a repugnance for the conception of it as order- ly process, and particularly for stable quan- titative relations. The meaning of the very concept of an "event" is interpreted in this way, which, of course, is in harmony with everyday usage, reflecting the interests of the man in the street. Numerous examples are cited, such as the spark which starts a forest fire, the assassination which precipi- tates a world war, etc. It is true that there are such phenomena and that they present a certain difficulty for the quantitative conception of causality fa- vored by scientific thinkers. That the diffi- culty is not insuperable for scientific method in general is proved by the simple fact that men are able to predict the consequences of such events, and even the events themselves and their magnitude, accurately enough to make such knowledge useful for action. The root of the apparent anomaly-the fail- ure of quantitative correspondence between cause and effect-is well brought out by the case of a spark and the resulting conflagra- tion or explosion. The phenomenon centers in the release of stored "potential energy"; this is admittedly a nonempirical, metaphys- ical conception and is somewhat repugnant to the scientific mind, but it has to be recog- nized and used in scientific thought. All the higher phenomena of life, everything beyond photosynthesis (which is the opposite phe- nomenon), consist essentially of the release of potential energy. All animal life is a spe- cies of combustion, including all that goes on in our own bodies. And practically all our control over natural phenomena, all our ability to use nature for human purposes, centers in the mysterious capacity of thought and will to direct the mode of re- lease of potential energy in living and non- living nature, beginning with our own nerves and muscles. To a limited extent we are also able to direct its accumulation, especially in agriculture. But the growing plant is fi- nally no exception to the downhill flow of energy. Like a hydraulic dam, the fixation of a certain amount of carbon merely catch- es and temporarily imprisons a minute quan- tity of energy radiated from the sun. Physical science recognizes unstable as well as stable equilibrium, but it is no exag- geration to say that in fact the latter is in- finitely more important. And it is also vast-</page><page sequence="6">SOCIAL CA USA TION 51 ly more important in biological phenomena, and even in those of psychology, where ap- parent discontinuity and the absence of dis- coverable quantitative equivalence are most striking. Modern electronic physics is, in- deed, based on the notions of ultimately un- stable equilibrium and ultimate discontinu- ity. Here quantitative theory runs in terms of statistical probability. But for all "gross" phenomena, for all change subject to any kind of direct observation (with possible reservations for thought itself), an event, in the everyday meaning, is simply a case of ex- ceptionally rapid change, and quantitative relations still hold between what happens and its "conditions." What Professor MacIver says about eco- nomics tends to confirm the reviewer's im- pression that it is futile for an economic the- orist to discuss the problems of this disci- pline with a sociologist. One or the other seems to lack those primary perceptions of fact and principle in this field which make relevant communication possible-and the question of which one it is can hardly be fruitfully discussed by the parties them- selves. To begin with, the writer does not know of any expression by economists which has the implications criticized in the section referred to-e.g., that "change advance[s] by a series of jumps and halts as disturb- ances successively interrupt states of equi- librium" (p. I64), or that "change itself [is] the incidental and temporary interruption of a persistent order" (p. I69). We do not be- lieve there is any implication in the writings of any recognized economist that the con- cept of equilibrium implies either stationari- ness or that change is "slow," whatever that may mean. And the word "normal," as used in the writings of reputable economists, has (as far as known) no other meaning than the reference to equilibrium under condi- tions defined with respect to the problem under discussion-and entirely different ac- cording to the problem. Consequently, such theory does not "minimize change in favor of the status quo" (p. I69) except as all sci- entific explanation of change runs in terms of the unchanging. If one were to look for the "cause" of the sociologist's attitude to- ward economics (which is virtually that of the man in the street), it is not far to seek; it roots in the abhorrence of the romanticist for anything that can be interpreted as de- fending anything that exists, and the natu- ral suspicion that this is what others are doing. However, it is true and important, if unfortunate, that scientific explanation of what is demonstrates that it is inevitable under the given conditions, which is easily interpreted as a defense. The meaning of equilibrium in economic theory is best shown by a mechanical anal- ogy. The explanation of a price (or, in fact, any other economic variable) is closely par- allel to the explanation of the level of water in a tank or reservoir where water flows in by one pipe and out by another. Given the head of the inflow and the relevant charac- teristics of the outflow (and the density of the fluid), it is fairly easy to calculate the head in the tank itself which will equalize the two. But it goes without saying that this head will actually prevail only "at equilibrium," when the two rates of flow are in fact equal and the head is stationary in relation to the given conditions. There is, to repeat, absolutely no implication that these conditions will be constant over time. The intellectual confusion in denying the rele- vance of these equilibrium concepts centers in ignoring the practical significance of the role of time. If a change is introduced in any of the conditions taken as given, the actual level of the water in the tank at any moment could be predicted from all the given conditions; but it would be a compli- cated function of time, in relation to the "conditions" themselves as functions of time. The equilibrium method is practically indispensable in the interpretation of reality because the given conditions are changing, not because they are stationary. It is neces- sary because changes in the value magni- tude to be predicted lag behind changes in the given conditions which ultimately de- termine it. It is not usually possible to predict the</page><page sequence="7">52 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY actual magnitude of a dependent variable at any moment, as a function of time, be- cause the necessary data are not available. The use of the method is chiefly to predict the direction of change and to give some idea of the magnitude and speed of the change to be expected; this is possible to the extent that the changes of the independent variable themselves are predictable. These changes, in turn, can often and to a useful extent be predicted through the use of the same method, by bringing them into rela- tion, as dependent variables, with others which are treated as independent, or causal, in relation to them. Thus, the method of economic theory on the whole proceeds by steps or stages from the variables of pri- mary interest back to others which those who apply the theory-businessmen or statesmen-must know, as constants or as functions of time, deriving their informa- tion from factual data of the situation in which they act. Of course, it is a part of eco- nomic science as a whole to give instruction as to these data or the sources from which they may be obtained; but it is not a part of the task of general theory. A vitally important fact which is almost systematically ignored by the critics of eco- nomic theory-including most specialists in other social sciences and many who are called economists, as well as the man in the street-is that the subject as expounded in modern times has been developed with defi- nite reference to the practical needs of free society. This means that "society," repre- sented by the statesman, is not interested in the concrete content of the economic con- duct of individuals. The practical relevance of economic theory is chiefly to the prob- lems of social action. But in free society the objective of social control is not usually to make individuals behave in one particular way rather than in another; it is simply to create the conditions under which individ- uals will be able to realize their individual objectives to the maximum degree, i.e., to act harmoniously, with a minimum of con- flict and mutual frustration. Economic theory is the science which deals with general principles, first, of indi- vidual conduct, from the point of view of quantitative means and ends. This is the meaning of "economic behavior," which is one meaning of rational behavior. It takes individual ends as given and is concerned with the rational use of means in realizing ends, i.e., in realizing them to the maximum extent possible with the available means, in- cluding knowledge of the ways of using means (technology) as well as concrete re- sources, material and human. There seems to be some innate repugnance in human na- ture against this whole point of view, against rationally facing the problem of choice as a comparison of possible alternatives. Human nature seems to be fundamentally romantic in this regard; men in general hate any refer- ence to "costs," which means simply the de- liberate comparison of alternatives. This attitude (prejudice?) is reflected in such statements as that made by Professor MacIver to the effect that the works of an artist or a prophet are primary values be- cause some people get direct satisfaction from them, while "a similar statement does not hold for the trader or the manufacturer or the banker or the engineer or the arma- ment maker" because "the utilities they pro- vide remain also means for those who pro- vide them" (p. 278). To this writer such a statement is a sheer absurdity, a distinction without a difference. Books and pictures, and manufactured products, mercantile services, and anything that is salable are patently alike in being sources of direct sat- isfaction to their "consumers," who pay money for them and so give up other satis- factions because they prefer these. What Professor MacIver presumably means is that "the direct satisfactions" in the one case are in some sense "higher," on a scale of absolute values, than they are in the other. We need not enter into a discussion of the question raised, beyond suggesting that the author might have said what he meant and observing that it does not fall in the field either of economics or of any other social science, unless this field is made to in- clude all philosophy as the theory of ulti-</page><page sequence="8">SOCIAL CAUSATION 53 mate values. And the answer to the ques- tion would not in any way affect the validity or significance of economics as a special sci- ence. Only in a provisional and preliminary sense, however, is economics a science of in- dividual behavior. In its main content it is a social science. It deals with interindivid- ual relations, with co-operation or organiza- tion between individuals for increasing effi- ciency in the use of means to realize their ends. Modern economics treats chiefly of a particular form or mode of co-operative or- ganization-that which is worked out through the exchange of goods and services in markets (more accurately, their purchase and sale against money as an intermediary in exchange). When economists approve or condemn the system, they are speaking as social or moral philosophers, or as ordinary human beings, and not as scientists. Whether they "ought" to do this or not is another problem of values. (But we may note again that any scientific explanation presents a superficial appearance of justify- ing the results which it explains, since it treats them as necessary consequences of causes.) It is worth noting also that all "free" co- operation takes the general form of ex- change. Moreover, it is difficult to discuss social relations in purely hypothetical or fac- tual terms, entirely free of value judgments, especially if motives are taken into account. In particular, it is difficult to discuss social relations in the context of our own culture without assuming or implying that individ- ual freedom is a good as well as a fact; hence, that the individual has a right to be the judge as to his own wants. It might be bet- ter if even these normative judgments were kept more clearly separate from scientific analysis than is usually done in economics textbooks; or it might not; that, again, is a question of values. But sociologists would hardly claim to be in a position to throw stones at economists on this point-and the statement applies to the work under review. As a sociological datum we may throw in the observation that the traditions of literature and learning as well as religion manifest a romantic-aristocratic prejudice against "the market"; practically anything that has a connection with money is regarded as "sor- did." But the market is simply a mecha- nism for organizing relations of mutual ad- vantage, which is assumed to be a good; and, incidentally, the free-market organization leaves any persons who do not like the terms of co-operation established in the market, by the meeting of minds of all interested parties, free to adopt any other terms on which they can agree as better. These more detailed criticisms bring us back, by way of conclusion, to the larger issues raised by Professor MacIver's treat- ment as a whole. This discussion must be reduced to the briefest compass and most summary form. The main issue centers in the relation between science and interpreta- tion and the corresponding implications of the concept of causation. As already noted, Part IV, which comprises the last third of the work, bears the title, "Interpretation." It starts out in the same general way as the book as a whole. The first section (of chap. x, "The Realm of Conscious Being") deals with "The Dynamic Realms" and presents a classification more or less parallel with the "Modes of the Question Why," distin- guished in chapter i, section ii. As in the rest of the book, the author constantly in- sists on "real" causation, here under the name of "The Dynamic Assessment" (mean- ing essentially the rational evaluation of ob- jectives); but, at the same time, whenever he gets down to the brass tacks of concrete problems, he insists on sociology's being a "positive" science of descriptive analysis and generalization. This dualistic view is, in the mind of the reviewer, philosophically correct. The procedure is open to criticism, first, in the detail (but surely a very impor- tant detail) that the treatment of scientific method seems to strive to ignore the quanti- tative aspects of cause and effect and the logical method of "concomitant variations," which has become nearly the whole proce- dure of modern inductive science. The au-</page><page sequence="9">54 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY thor's theory of method ignores the concep- tion of "function and variable"; and, even when he is explicitly discussing statistical procedure, he seems to strive to avoid quan- titative correspondence as far as possible. In fact, of course, the "all-or-none" rela- tionship is extremely rare in nature, if it oc- curs at all; and it is logically a special case of the broader principle. But our author pre- fers to think in terms of the methods of agreement and difference, with the main em- phasis on difference (see especially p. 65 n.). The more general criticism has to do with the failure to distinguish between science and interpretation and to bring out the rela- tion between the two. In the abstract, or logically speaking, the method of science is the same, regardless of the nature of the sub- ject matter. It consists in the discovery of uniformities of coexistence and sequence, regularities or stable patterns in the time and space relations of observed data, which are not apparent in the data themselves. The main differences in the meaning of caus- ation in natural and social science center in two facts. The first is the meaning of obser- vation. Strangely enough, our author does not mention this difference in either of his discussions of the major divisions of the field of knowledge. If the fact that social data are derived through intercommunication rather than through direct sense observa- tion may be regarded as not belonging to the nature of causation, this certainly cannot be said of communication as an essential fea- ture of the social process-unless one adopts the position of physical behaviorism, which the author is throughout particularly con- cerned to combat-and it is one of the most useful features of his book. Moreover, if in- tercommunicative activity is relegated to the realm of interpretation rather than to that of observation and induction-a kind of quasi-behaviorism-it nonetheless calls for explicit discussion in a book of this sort. But communication seems to be mentioned but once, and rather cursorily (in the con- cluding paragraph of the last chapter of Part III, p. 264), as incidental to the notion of "imaginative reconstruction." With respect to the division of the field of knowledge, from the standpoint of princi- ples of interpretation, the schemes given in chapters i and x are difficult to reconcile, and both seem vulnerable at many points. Attempts of this sort are, of course, familiar, especially from the hands of sociologists, back to the famous hierarchy of Auguste Comte. The results differ widely from one author to another, and the problem raised, however important, cannot be discussed here. But the writer would offer two or three criticisms of MacIver's second scheme (pp. 272-73), with only brief reference to the more elaborate (and more confused?) layout given in chapter i. The first step is a division of all "Being" into three realms: the physical, the organic, and the conscious. These must be interre- lated in some way with the scheme of four "nexi" (p. 27I): the physicochemical, the biological, the psychological, and the social; presumably they correspond to the first three. The third is said to have three vari- eties, or aspects, "exhibiting, respectively, objective, motivation, and design"-all modes of "teleological activity." The au- thor continues: In this form of activity we introduce for the first time the relation of means and ends,. the emergence into the realm of consciousness of the relation of organs and functions. As this form of activity becomes socially articulate, two interdependent systems or orders gradually be- come distinct, the system of apparatus or means, and the system of values or ends. These we designate respectively the technologi- cal order and the cultural order. The social order itself is the scheme of relationships be- tween social beings ..... In the social order the .... social nexus for the first time appears [p. 2711. Then we are told explicitly that the three orders-cultural, technological, and social- lie "within .... the realm of conscious Be- ing" (p. 272). After close study the reviewer finds much of this scheme unintelligible. We can under- stand the ideas of physical being, with and without life, and of life with and without</page><page sequence="10">SOCIAL CA USA TION 55 consciousness. But the relation between conscious being and society is quite obscure. For symmetry, the meaning would be that conscious being may be either social or non- social; but in that case "social being" should be introduced as a fourth level. The intent of the discussion, in this chapter and in the book as a whole, seems to be rather to iden- tify the social and the conscious. But the facts surely call for recognition both of con- scious being, which is not social, and of so- cial being, which is not conscious. Specifi- cally with reference to human society and- to its scientific discussion, in sociology and anthropology, conscious activity plays a highly various, problematic, and, on the whole, rather limited role. The distinctive interpretive conception would rather be habit, formed in the individual and trans- mitted in the group by unconscious imita- tion. And a place must certainly be made for social forms and changes which result un- intentionally and unconsciously from acts which are individually conscious, in the sense of purpose or (conscious) teleology. If teleology is not restricted to conscious pur- pose, then the biological nexus of function all comes under this head. It would seem that the bulk of social process and change consists of activities which fall within the realm of behavior which lies somewhere in this region of the "functional" (in a broad, loose interpretation) but unintentional, whether conscious or unconscious. The author's scheme not only leaves the order of categories confused and obscure but finds no place for conduct which is at once consciously social and consciously pur- posive, i.e., for all deliberate group activity. That is, it excludes the phenomelna of demo- cratic political action and the similar activi- ties of the infinite variety of voluntary, pri- vate associations-unless, again, these are to be dealt with in physical-behavioristic terms, in accord with the canons of positive science in the strictest and narrowest inter- pretation. If they are to be dealt with "real- istically," in the higher meaning of the term and in accord with the position our author so ably espouses in the central section of his book, it is clearly necessary to recognize the category of "social mind," of group feeling and knowledge, and of group deliberation and choice. Finally, the identification of values with ends conceals or denies one of the most im- portant distinctions which has to be made in any realistic discussion of conscious teleol- ogy. This is the distinction between think- ing or deliberating about the procedure for realizing given ends (the appropriate use of means) and deliberation about what ends to pursue, in terms of more general purposes or ideals. (Confusion on this point has been noticed in connection with the author's mis- conception of the meaning of the economic as a behavior category.) Partly, no doubt, because popular usage and thinking eschew anything resembling careful analysis, there is no established terminology for clearly re- ferring to this distinction; but the minimum departure from general usage would seem to call for the use of the words "end" and "val- ue" for the purpose-though value has other meanings, including both economic value (relative magnitude of different given ends) and even pure mathematical magnitude as such.
