Marc Silberman 'Der letzte Mann' ist international, weil er ein deutscher Spitzenfilm ist, wie der amerikani- sche international ist, wenn er ein amerikani- scher Spitzenfilm ist.1 propose that raising the issue of Germanness in the cinema may dislodge some of the clich6s and truisms about national cinema history. Culture has traditionally been seen as an important, if not the primary domain for the constitution of national identity and in so far as the development of the modern nation-state can be regarded as a crucial component of modernity and modernising tendencies (i.e. emerging with the notion of the citizen in the French Revolution), culture is closely tied to the factors defining a nation. Germany's tardy political unification in the nineteenth century and subsequent repeated ex- periences of political division during the twentieth century have often been compensated for in a self-proclaimed, more abstract unity of the 'Kultur- nation' (meaning variously a cultured nation and a nation unified through its cultural achievements). If nothing else, this concept reveals the exagger- ated centrality assigned to cultural representations in the past understanding of Germanness. Indeed, as far as cinema is concerned, the notion of culture itself - referring both to artistry and to craftsman- ship - may be the simplest way to define its Germanness. Certainly, vis-6-vis Hollywood, Ger- man cinema (and European cinema in general) represents a source of that artistic leavening called 'culture', the ingredient that connotes sophistica- tion and prestige for the American public. It is not surprising, then, that German films yield histori- cally conditioned signifiers for national identity both in content and in the discourse about the nature of film as a medium. From production to distribution, from import to censorship policies, from marketing to reception, from film subsidies to film criticism, the cinema apparatus in Germany has articulated national interests and constructed national tradition. I hope to suggest with a few examples that this aspect of national identity is neither coherent nor a given, but rather the product of an ongoing struggle between local culture(s) and global pressure(s). For geographers, political scientists and histo- rians, Germany has never been easy to define. Since the Middle Ages the borders of Central Europe have been especially pervious and vari- able. Located at the crossroads of travel routes from east to west and north to south, Germany's position on the map at any given time manifested volatile relations between a given centre and its peripheries, between a perceived inside and the outside of its borders, between those who were included and those who were excluded. As a result, for social scientists the study of Germany has usually been explicitly ideological because the nation or the people ('das Volk') in their discourses is an eminently political concept. Whether oriented toward a rationalistic, Enlightenment no- Marc Silberman Professor of German, Ph.D. Indiana University 1975.

Literary historians, art historians, music historians and cinema historians have been relatively comfortable with a coherent idea of Germany. Franz Kafka writing in German in his Czech language environment under the Austro- Hungarian monarchy belongs to the canon of twentieth-century German literature; Hans Hol- bein, who lived and painted in Basel and London for twenty-five years, is referred to as a sixteenth- century German Master; the German-born com- poser Georg Friedrich Handel wrote his compositions for 48 years in London during the seventeenth century; and many German film- makers like Fritz Lang and Wim Wenders spent crucial years in the United States. Notwithstanding the perturbations of historical canon formation, all of these artists are considered to belong to German culture and they are only the tip of an iceberg consisting of those many cosmopolitan travellers, immigrants, exiles and colonised peoples who are usually integrated into German cultural history. Any consideration of the Germanness of the German cinema immediately encounters problems of various dimensions which are directly related to the facts I have just mentioned. On the most abstract level and hence applicable to the general status of nation and cinema, are questions con- cerning the drawing of boundaries. At the very least, national identity is a formulation of co- herence charged by distinctions, by notions of exclusion and inclusion. National cinema as con- ceptual category relies on similar operations, most obviously in the construction of a canon of films that would illustrate or constitute the national as- pects of a specific cinema. But what may or must be excluded in order to speak of the German cinema? the mass of mediocre films that do not exemplify stylistic innovation but yet enjoy popular reception? the pervasive import/export relations that have always characterised the distribution and exhibition markets, not to speak of the inter- national movement of ideas and talent among film producers? the Otherness against which the na- tion's cinema is maintained? Less abstract but still within the conceptual realm of Germanness are considerations as to what is gained and lost by defining the German cinema as a historical or cultural entity. For example, is the Germanness of the German cinema simply a fictional or imagined unity that conceals equally powerful forces in the development of local traditions such as interna- tional competition on ideological, economic and/or stylistic levels? As to more concrete aspects of national cinema history, the very question con- cerning the nature of the object under discussion is relevant. What indeed constitutes the object of German national cinema?: certain formal struc- tures shared by a corpus of films? common nar- ratives or genres? social experience or historical processes already defined as nationally specific and then reflected in film stories? the economic and technological developments that enable the pro- duction of films? the unconscious anxieties and hopes of a national population articulated in films? Finally, the elusively straightforward question 'what is a German film?' resonates with all the complexities tied to the historical entity known as Germany: is it defined by language, territory, history, culture, mentality and/or myth? Did the Austrian cinema - that integrated much talent from Hungary and Czechoslovakia during the 1920s - become German in 1938 when it was annexed and then Austrian again after 1945? Where does the German-language cinema from Switzerland fit in? And what about the series of early sound films produced by American studios in Hollywood or Paris for the German audience in German? or the films produced by exile Germans during the Third Reich that were never even screened at the time in Germany? That such issues can have practical conse- quences beyond the speculative activity of defining national cinemas becomes obvious in the context of quotas, an exclusionary measure that was used for the first time after World War I to protect national cinema markets. After Germany com- pletely banned foreign films during the War, the first negotiations to control imports were com- pleted in late 1920 with the goal of restricting 298 Marc Silberman</page><page sequence="3">What is German in the German cinema? 299 foreign imports to about 15 per cent (although annual overruns came to about 20 per cent).2 To maintain a competitive exhibition and distribution market despite a crisis in production, the system was refined in 1925, allowing one imported film for every domestic feature distributed. The penetra- tion of the German market by international capital and personnel in the second half of the 1920s made necessary a legal definition of what con- stituted a domestic film production, e.g. what was to be considered a German film.3 In 1930 a further revision of the quota system spelled out the details: Previously, a feature film had been classified German so long as it was made in Germany in no less than fourteen studio days and was at least 1500 metres long. Effective 1 July 1930 the production company had to be German; the script writer, composer, director and majority of personnel in each production area had to be German speaking residents; all studio work and if feasible, all outdoor scenes had to be shot in Germany. In 1932 these stipulations were considerably sharp- ened: the producer and seventy-five per cent of all production personnel had to be German and most importantly, a German was re- defined as a legal citizen of the Reich.4 More important than the criteria of language and geo-political borders as the basis of determin- ing Germanness for these restrictive purposes is the fact that the notion of 'German' itself was subject to historical transformation and interpretation. The next step, the racially discriminatory practices based on blood and ethnicity instituted by the National Socialists shortly after taking power in 1933, signaled what can only be regarded with irony as Germany's most distinctly national period of film production. More recently the controversy between the European Union and the United States government concerning free trade and open ac- cess in the communications market (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or the GATT talks, concluded in December 1993) once again placed on the agenda the issue of restrictive import quotas to protect national cinemas or - in a new twist - the European film from unfair competition. And of course, 'European' itself is a term remaining to be defined, a term resting on borders, membership, erasure of inner borders and expansion of outside borders. Out of these questions the crux of the matter emerges with particular clarity. In reflecting on the difficulty of discussing the British cinema as a national phenomenon, Edward Buscombe sug- gested years ago that any national cinema is caught between the alternatives of imitating Holly- wood or contradicting it, between conforming to it and emulating it, because Hollywood has become a kind of phantasm synonymous with the cinema.5 From this perspective the simple (and not incorrect) answer to the question 'what is German in the German cinema' must be: it is the defensive position vis-a-vis 'Hollywood', whatever that has meant at specific historical junctures to the Ger- mans. Indeed, in Germany the discourse about cinema and nation has developed almost exclu- sively from 1921 on to the present through com- petition with American films, technology and marketing. Yet this simple answer is misleading for two reasons. First, the Hollywood (or American) cinema is to a large extent the product of interna- tional talent, in so far as personnel and technology are concerned. From the earliest Hollywood years - in contrast to other industrial and entertainment fields - it was characterised by openness to immi- grants. After it had conquered the international market in the mid-1920s, the studios were even more aggressive in buying or coopting talent from Europe. Thus, the American cinema represents not so much the Other but rather a successful integra- tion of its own cultural 'others' into a new amal- gam. Second, the European cinemas have not only been victims of the American juggernaut and its superior financial resources; they have also been challenged in the positive sense to develop strategies that respond to conventions and expec- tations schooled in their domestic audiences through popular American films, reintegrating in a complex exchange forms, genres, styles and themes that originally emerged from a specific national context.6 Films, in other words, play with cinematic traditions and viewers' desires that have been formed, at least in Europe and certainly in Germany, by non-national standards. In this re- spect the cinema has always been a global phe- What is German in the German cinema? 299</page><page sequence="4">300 Marc Silberman Fig. 1.

While the Euro- pean proponents consider the cinema to be an artistic medium with claims to the same kind of government support and protection accorded to literature, theatre, opera, museums and historical architecture, their American adversaries insist on film as a commodity that moves within market structures of investment and amortisation. To be sure, the recognition of film's status as an art has been, at least in Germany, a controversial achieve- ment that in some ways even defines the German cinema's Germanness. To agree that this status is worth defending as the decisive contribution of the European cinema to the global market is in itself noteworthy on the part of its European proponents; it also indicates where a more complicated answer to the central question of my deliberations might be sought. From a retrospective view national cultures within a larger, pluralistically structured global network have maintained themselves by negotiating locally the contradictory intersection of art and commerce in a markedly differentway than 'Hollywood' does. Equally essential, however, is the recognition that national identity itself has been subject to change, the product of imaginary activ- ity and competing local communities. At this point it would be simply speculative to push the question further and to ask whether the German cinema is or will continue to be German. My goal is rather to understand how the answers emerge depending on the way the question is understood and even formulated. I considered, for example, various periods of German film history that would lend themselves to working through some of the problems delineated above. If the cinema of the Third Reich offers the most unmedi- ated alignment of national interest, national ident- ity and nationalist ideology, then one could elicit here the characteristic German features of the cinema, provided one could bracket its fascist support structure. Because state authority and the film industry, social needs and art coalesced in the affirmative ideology of an autarchic society, all films produced during the twelve years of the Third Reich aimed at establishing and maintaining a group identity that would differentiate or exclude the Other. By extending Siegfried Kracauer's his- torical sweep in From Caligari to Hitler, one could argue that the latent 'German' characteristics of the Weimar cinema came into their own only after 1933, displacing the internationalism that domi- nated the 1 920s.7 This resolves the terminological controversy of naming the period (the Nazi cinema, the fascist cinema in Germany or the cinema of the Third Reich), since political content recedes as the distinguishing factor, while themes, spaces, narrative structures and language patterns become decisive features.8 The East German cinema shares with the cinema of the Third Reich the historical coherence of a clearly marked political beginning and end (1933/1945 in the one case, 1949/1990 in the other) and the coherence of a state film production company with an explicit cultural policy. It offers nonetheless a rather different access to the ques- tion of Germanness. Embedded within the rhetori- cal internationalism of the Comintern on the one hand, and the concept of a national, German heritage of socialist culture on the other, East Germany's official ideology sought to distinguish itself from West Germany, seen as heir both to German imperialism and National Socialism. Yet, curiously, both East and West German societies, emerging from the trauma of the Third Reich with its racial determinism and national sense of mission, repressed the issue of nation and nation- alism.9 The apparent vacuum of national identity was, of course, not really a void and both the positive and negative emotions associated with Germanness were displaced in other directions. In the East German cinema the commitment to nar- ratives about antifascist struggle, the central and founding proposition of the governing regime, explicitly divided guilt and innocence among the characterisations of 'bad' and 'good' Germans. And the strong tradition of historical and bio- graphical films traced in the choice of the events and figures represented the effort to construct a 'German' history for the cinema public. In West Germany the New German Cinema of the 1970s gained an international reputation to a large ex- tent owing to its historicising discourses of German guilt, i.e. its critical resistance to the often cited 'inability to mourn' and to come to terms with the fascist past during the 1950s and 1960s. The What is German in the German cinema? 301</page><page sequence="6">302 Marc Si/berman frequently voiced scepticism within West Germany about the popularity of these films among the domestic audience and the suspicion that the New German Cinema was a creation of foreign cine- philes suggest other ways of mediating German- ness in the cinema. Film as cultural commodity, sustained by governmental subsidy programs and distributed worldwide by governmental agencies as a prestige product for self-representation, shifts attention from production practices to market strategies for the purpose of cultural legitimation. In what follows I will concentrate on an earlier period of German film production and at the same time resist the traditional convenience of political caesuras to define that period. My comments will focus on the developments from 1912 with the onset of the long narrative film in Germany to the introduction of sound in 1929. I am attracted to these years for a number of reasons. First, German film history tends to regard the founding of the UFA production firm as a government agency in 1917 and its postwar transformation into the largest commercial film production unit as the decisive event in the evolution of a German national film industry. As a result, the Weimar cinema has become a familiar, well-ploughed field of inquiry, offering some particularly salient propositions about national style. I propose that shifting the periodisation will shed some light on the way such categories evolve. Second, the years 1912-29 offer an especially rich discursive field for broader controversies about modernity and new visual modes of expression in Germany. The technical and aesthetic achievements that came to charac- terise the long narrative film in Germany show how the new mass medium not only helped transform the very meaning of nation and nationalism as cultural signs, but also how it became the medium of representation that could better articulate the contradictions of modern cultural crisis. II Uberhaupt ist es bezeichnend, dab der na- tionale Charakter der Filme am deutlichsten im Stil der Photographie zu Tage tritt. 0 'Weimar cinema' has become the shorthand de- scriptor for the classical period of German cinema, that apogee when art, technology, biographies and commerce combined to create, at least retro- spectively, a span of years identified by its quality and influence. It refers to German film productions between 1918 and 1933, a periodisation that should immediately raise suspicion because of its reliance on political ruptures - the collapse of the monarchy with the end of the Great War in 1918 and the accession to power by the National So- cialists in March 1933 - to define an aesthetic, narrative or stylistic coherence. From institutional and socio-cultural perspectives there is good rea- son to accept these politically determined paren- theses. Both the government's involvement in establishing the UFA company in 1917 and the official policies instituted in 1934 to regulate racial exclusion, censorship and cultural synchronisation ('Gleichschaltung') do mark hiatuses in cinematic production that followed directly political realign- ments within the state. Similarly, the emphasis on beginning and end privileges the aspect of social vulnerability, the two breaks suggesting a sym- metry of loss and transformation, of crisis and inversion. Eliciting the narrative correlatives or cinematic reflections of these social upheavals has been, since Kracauer, a popular and forceful interpretative model for the Weimar cinema. Yet this politically determined periodisation obscures other continuities. First, a sophisticated discourse on the fundamental cultural shift intro- duced by modernity and modernism began al- ready in the 1910s. The cinema was widely perceived as the paradigm of modern experience, assuming a new and an essential role in the mediation of culture in capitalist society. Both domestic productions (a diverse spectrum from cheap potboilers to art films) and foreign im- ports (prior to the war from Scandinavia and France, in the 1920s from the United States and the Soviet Union) became the catalysts for dis- cussions about the cinema's power to subvert traditional oppositions between high and low cul- ture, art and commerce, the urban and the domes- tic ('Heimat'). Second, the introduction of sound cinema in Germany in 1929, well before the end of the Weimar period, accounts for another set of dynamics. The mechanical dimension of the new medium once again became especially apparent and demonstrated very quickly in a new develop- 302 Marc Silberman</page><page sequence="7">What is German in the German cinema? 303 mental trajectory that technology did not inhibit aesthetic claims, no matter how they may have been understood. In Germany the onset of sound suggests, then, an end to a specific evolution in the formal properties of visualisation that began in the early 1910s with the introduction of the long narrative film. Third and finally, the forced exile of many left and Jewish artists and intellectuals at the end of the Weimar Republic can not conceal the continuity in cinema personnel, genres and styles beyond 1933, qualifying the assumed political break with the demise of the Weimar Republic. Owing to Germany's relatively late political unification in 1871, its subsequent, delayed mod- ernisation was experienced with exaggerated harshness. Here as in no other country the cinema encountered resistance as a threat and antagonist to 'culture' in its tendency toward standardisation, democratisation and internationalism. This discur- sive site reveals in turn the defensive class charac- ter and elitist assumptions of those who wished to control imagination. The fact that one of the most public discussions in Germany around the nature of the silent cinema as art began in the 191 Os and continued into the 1920s indicates as well the extent to which it entered into the very experience of modern life. The cinema came to provide the most intense aesthetic articulation of the urban environment with its spectacles of the masses, its technology and its display of consumerism and fashion. Indeed, the history of the long narrative film between 1912 and 1929 documents the evo- lution of a specific model of cinematic repre- sentation that ushered in new conventions for visual experience. The German silent film compen- sated the absence of verbal language by devel- oping remarkable strategies of image composition, acting and camera movement. While promising the utopia of universal communication within the tradition of idealist aesthetics, it regis- tered with particular acuity the slippage from an understanding of art's signfying or meaning func- tion to the notion of culture as commodity within a system of circulation. In this guise the cinema came to define a national discourse and a discourse on national culture. Reconsidering this phase of German cinema brings two aspects to the fore: its putative innova- tive features are thrown into relief, and the tradi- tional art historical distinction between the expres- sionist films and the later realist films of the classi- cal period begins to dissolve. I will examine these two aspects within the context of the changing status of the image in the long narrative film and in the process will touch on some of the central issues that in my view define its specifically Ger- man features. These include, on the one hand, the insight into the technological contingency of aes- thetic production in the new medium with conse- quences for an emphasis on technical professionalism and, on the other, the utopian conviction that gesture and physiognomy in the silent cinema constituted a modern equivalent of universal language and hence the guarantee that cinema is a legitimate art. The period 1912-29 is too diverse to be categorised adequately either by specific motifs and content or to be reduced to a studio style or vocabulary of mise-en-scene. Individual bio- graphies alone elide such neat divisions. Some, like director Ernst Lubitsch, producer Erich Pommer and actor Emil Jannings began their cinema careers in the mid-191 0s with successful features, produced a variety of films after the war (in style, genre and quality), then were invited to Hollywood and - in the case of the latter two - returned to Weimar Germany to continue their cinema careers. Others came to Germany from around the world, bringing with them 'national' cinematic traditions and blending them into the German cinema. Actress Asta Nielsen and producer Urban Gad from Denmark, for example, were pioneers in the German studios of the 1910s. Some of the most remarkable directing careers that found a temporary domicile in Germany after the War included Dmitri Buchovetzki from the Soviet Union, Carl Dreyer from Denmark and Josef von Sternberg from Hollywood (viz. Austria).1' In a real sense, one can speak of the integrative power of the German cinema, then, just as the American cinema at this time was marked by its international vitality. Indeed, based on biographies, it could be argued that the German cinema came to be char- acterised first and foremost by professionalism and technical craftmanship. The film industry had de- veloped by the early 1920s a reputation for the intense collaboration of directors and actors, set and costume designers and lighting and camera What is German in the German cinema? 303</page><page sequence="8">304Marc Silberman Fig. 2. Asta Nielsen and Poul Reumert in Afgrunden ( Danish production was the first film distributed in Ger vehicle. crews, a reputation supported by the increasing international marketability of their skills. This may seem all the more astonishing since the diverse German studios did not hold a set of production values or practices in common prior to the Third Reich. I propose, rather, that the cinema's co- herence is to be found on a more abstract plane, as a response to the change in the aesthetic consciousness of modernism and as the search for adequate means to transform this consciousness into images. Contrary to the traditional view of the classical German cinema, then, I see it not simply as the sum of two polar styles - expressionism in the first part of the 1 920s and realism in the second - but rather as an ongoing search for a visual language that began in the early 1910s. The first long narrative films - those of 750 to 900 metres (45-50 minutes) - were produced in Germany in 1911 in response to the popular reception of imported multi-reel films.12 These in- cluded a series of American boxing documentaries screened in early 1911 (a sport allowed in Ger- many only after 1910) as well as the immensely successful Danish production Afgrunden by Urban Gad that launched Asta Nielsen as a 'star'. Of course, multi-reel films had been produced and circulated in Italy ..... ! ii b(monumental epics) and France (theatrical 'films mn a aa9 wd'art') since at least 1907, but in Germany the breakthrough to long films presupposed changes in the distribu- tion and exhibition sec- Y e t tors that in turn had far-reaching conse- quences for the entire film industry. In contrast to the monopoly model of production and distribu- tion in France and the oligopoly model in the United States, the Ger- 2Nordisk 1 910). The man film industry before many as wla star 1912 was to a large ex- tent controlled by the many small distributors that bought up shorts on the international market and composed weekly programs for rental to the cinemas. The introduc- tion of the multi-reeler had displaced within a year's time the short film from the market, leading among other things to the temporary disappear- ance of documentaries and actualites.13 The multi- reeler's emergence in 1911 went hand in hand, however, with a general boom in the film industry. Audience interest in the longer, more complex stories led to a jump in the number of cinemas after a slump of several years; the number of distributors doubled between 1910 and 1913 to service the new exhibition needs; and within a year the num- ber of productions firms in Berlin grew from 1 1 to 26 for the expanding market of long films.14 It is noteworthy that these were almost exclusively in- dependent production facilities, no longer tied to companies that also produced or sold cameras and projectors. The growth in the production sector led as well to a noticeable rise in the number of employees working under better conditions. The extended shooting time required by the long fea- ture film not only demanded a more rational, cooperative division of labour among the produc- tion team with clearly identified responsibilities for producer, director, cinematographer, designer 304 Marc Silberman</page><page sequence="9">What is German in the German cinema? 305 and actor but also allowed for more intensive, directed attention to the final product, since the pressure of delivering the weekly short-film pro- gram no longer determined the production sche- dule. Finally, the long film engendered new marketing strategies. Nielsen's unprecedented success in Afgrunden (the first film distributed as a star vehicle in Germany) led to strategies of block bookings based on her star recognition and the construction of audience identification through an assortment of promotionals like postcards, maga- zine feature articles and personal appearances. Serial productions, especially the popular detec- tive films by Joe May (Stuart Webb), Max Landa (Joe Deebs) and Richard Oswald (Sherlock Holmes) were another means to ensure audience loyalty and continued ticket sales. The shift from shorts to long narrative features had aesthetic implications too. German short-film production was a cinema of attractions that drew on the sensationalism of the spectacle and the reportage of the documentary.15 The long film, in contrast, was oriented toward the narration of events and psychological representation. The detective films mentioned above were, of course, useful for devising visual and narrative conventions of continuity in time and space with their chase sequences and suspense scenes, but more typical for the evolution of film language - camera move- ment, shot punctuation, framing and image com- position - was the distinctive theatrical 'look' of the German feature film. Given the extraordinary level of international exchange and imitation that char- acterised the film industry prior to 1914, this can hardly be explained by technical ineptitude or ignorance. Rather it was an effect of the unusually strong competition the cinema faced from more traditional media in Germany. The rapid transition to the longer film was accompanied by a gain in prestige for the new medium. As early as 1910 the construction of luxurious cinema palaces in the large cities had anticipated the competition with the introduction of promenading lobbies, differen- tiated ticket pricing for balcony, loges and orches- tra sections, comfortable seats (instead of folding chairs) and doormen. For middle-class audiences the cinema began to offer an ambiance that com- pared favourably to the theatre, the opera and the public lecture, and they in turn expected a certain level of cultural sophistication. With the long nar- rative film the producers found an opportunity to respond to this lucrative audience by fusing the desire for entertainment with the more traditional sentiment for moral improvement that charac- terised the taste of the educated elite in Germany. The 'Autorenfilm' or literary film, modelled on the French 'film d'art', represented the first domes- tic attempt to integrate high profile artists from the literary world as a source for script material (Ger- hart Hauptmann, Arthur Schnitzler, Hugo von Hof- mannsthal) and from the theatre as directors (Max Reinhardt) and actors (Alfred Bassermann, Paul Wegener). The short-lived undertaking produced few films, but nonetheless the cooperation sym- bolised an important advance for a cultural dis- course in which the cinema was generally seen as the antagonist or utter opposite of artistic endea- vors.16 Moreover, in films like Der Andere (191 3), Die Landstrasse (1913), Der Student von Prag (1913), Insel der Seligen (1913) and Der Golem (1914) it is possible to identify traces of the ex- pressive acting, the exaggerated visual meta- phors, the ponderous editing rhythm and the domination of space over time that would typify the postwar films in Germany. Here, too, are the roots of the fantastical narratives and doubling scenarios that endow images with metaphysical significance, as if they were resisting the reification of the modern world conveyed by the lack of depth in the two-dimensional space of the movie screen.17 Of similar symbolic import was Kurt Pinthus' Das Kinobuch, a collection of prose sket- ches by younger writers identified loosely with the expressionist avant-garde that appeared in early 1914.18 Their texts were not scripts but did strive to adapt a filmic style with the drastic sensational- ism and popular, burlesque elements associated with the cinema. Only one text was actually filmed, which reflects as much on their cinematic quality as on the producers' lack of eagerness to cooper- ate with avant-garde authors, but Das Kinobuch nevertheless presages the fundamentally modernist gesture that would inspire five years later the first expressionist films: a deliberate test of the aesthetic implications of a new medium for representing a new reality. While these efforts revealed a willingness to integrate entertainment with the arts, others feared 305 What is German in the German cinema?</page><page sequence="10">306 Marc Silberman Fig. 3. Die Landstrasse Deutsche Mutoskop- und Biogl traces of expressive acting and the domination of spa that the growing popularity of the mass medium among all classes would marginalise the tradi- tional, elitist arts. Theatre organisations called for boycotts against actors who appeared in films; religious groups demanded effective censorship measures to control the violence, crime and politi- cal subversion they saw dominating the imagin- ation of those who watched films; and teachers organisations wanted to counteract what they saw as the nefariously passive attitude instilled in spec- tators when they watched images projected in dark rooms. The debate about various reform measures to contain the threat of the new mass medium or to harness its power for educational purposes reached its climax in 1913-14 and certainly would have continued, if the war had not intervened.19 That it was carried out with more vehemence than in other countries, such as the United States, where women's leagues and tem- perance committees also railed against the debili- tating, demoralising effects of the movies, is an indication of the shock-like experience connected with the cinema's sudden intrusion into the con- sciousness of the German middle class.

Just as significant for the blossoming of film culture after the military defeat of 1 91 8 was the strong economic infrastruc- ture of the film industry with studios, technicians, film laboratories, distributions networks and cinemas waiting for the celluloid to roll. 306 Marc Silberman</page><page sequence="11">What is German in the German cinema? 307 Ill Diese Intensitdt ist ein neues, verborgenes Verstaindigungsmittel. Ist eine interationale Sprache ... eine neue Sprache wie der Film Oberhaupt.21 The experience of the First World War accelerated the modernist crisis and the search for strategies to confront it. An entire generation of Germans endured the war as the quintessential modern experience with its effects of fragmentation, alie- nation and loss of autonomy. In a society charac- terised by political upheaval, social disjuncture and economic misery the cinema promised its audience escape in exotic adventures, a means to displace anxieties in melodramas and titillating erotic tales and compensation for national shame in heroic narratives projected on to the past. From this perspective the German expressionist films represent one strain, and a crucial one, in a complicated encounter with modernism that sought to imagine answers to the crisis of subjectivity with new forms of visual expression. The attempt to define film expressionism is exacerbated by a number of factors. First, it appears to be an anach- ronism within the broader inter-arts context of the 1910s. The avant-garde art movement peaked before the war broke out. Literary expressionism, especially lyric poetry, was strongest in the early war years. Expressionist plays were written and already performed with characteristic expression- ist staging and acting during the war and tri- umphed in Berlin within a year after the revolution of 1918. In architectural design expressionism was largely limited to utopian and visionary struc- tures on paper that were circulated after the war but owing to the impoverished economy were never realised, except in some stage and film sets. In other words, expressionist cinema emerged on the scene when the experimental energies of the movement were beginning to dissipate and at a point when expressionist aesthetics were filtering into daily life and cultural consumerism. Second, very few films actually rendered the elusive ideal of expressionist cinema, integrating the charac- teristic vocabulary of set design, lighting and ac- ting associated with its style. Expressionist plots, directing style or editing are hard to enumerate with precision and certainly do not suffice as traits for defining an entire film period. Similarly, the presence of some expressionist stylistic elements in fantastical and fairy-tale films, in historical pa- geants and exotic adventure serials, as well as in the visionary, hallucinatory horror films associated with 'Caligarism' yield neither a workable body of themes nor a stable genre. Finally, drawing chro- nological boundaries also encounters problems. Motives of interiority, stylised acting and psycho- logised set design considered to be typical for the postwar expressionist films predate them in the earlier 'Autorenfilm' and can even be traced to other European cinemas prior to 191 8; moreover the 'end' of expressionist cinema has been dated anywhere from the production of Das Wachsfi- gurenkabinett (1923, released 1924) or Die Nibe- lungen (1923-24) or Variet6 (1925) or Faust and Metropolis (1926). The union of expressionism and cinema as a descriptive category seems to have emerged con- temporaneously as part of the extensive and, for German standards, unusual pre-marketing strategy of what has come to be considered by film historians as the originative expressionist film, Robert Wiene's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (pre- miere on 26 February 1920, in Berlin).22 Between August 1919 and February 1920 several articles appeared in film journals and newspapers suggesting that the film medium and expressionism were particularly compatible, with references even to Caligari, which was still in production.23 The film's producer, Erich Pommer, went so far as to claim later that precisely such money-making schemes underlay the stylised (viz. expressionistic) films; it was the German film industry's competitive edge over the Hollywood Goliath.24 To a large extent this retrospective legend has continued into the present to influence the subsequent film histori- cal category of German expressionist cinema: a body of art films with stylised features that came to be identified with German cinema as such. Rudolf Kurtz (editor of one of the major Wei- mar film journals, Lichtbildbuihne) presented the first contemporaneous, critical overview of ex- pressionist cinema in 1926 under the title Expres- sionismus und Film.25 The study's promising point of departure - a purposefully restricted corpus of only six films produced between 1919 and 1923 as well as a consistent refusal to recognise film What is German in the German cinema? 307</page><page sequence="12">308 Marc Si/berman Fig. 4. Psychologised set design in Die Nibelungen: K (Decla-Bioscop, 1924). Does the period of expression expressionism as assorted stylistic effects- became mired in a metaphysics of idealistic, spiritual re- demption through 'a will to art'. Kurtz's insistence, however, that film expressionism is the product of a constructivist rather than a mimetic impulse, focused attention at an early juncture in Germany on a major aspect of the visual power of Weimar cinema. Since then Siegfried Kracauer's and Lotte Eisner's two standard commentaries on Weimar cinema fatefully determined the post-World War II reception of German expressionism. Arguing in terms of psychological mimesis, Kracauer in his English-language study saw in expressionist films the reflection or externalisation of the tortured German psyche, which he then proceeded to generalise as a psychosocial disposition that char- acterised the entire production of the German film industry from 1913 to 1933.26 Eisner's French- language study only aggravated this inflationary usage by equating expressionism with a universal aesthetic of the eternal 'German soul', which then, despite her attention to visual imagery and motifs, was understood by many readers to characterise the entire silent cinema.27 Since then 'expression- ism' has taken on a life of its own in cinema history. In English commen- taries the usage is doubly muddled be- cause it refers to a German period style or body of films as well as to all films characterised by the expressive (rather than realistic) techni- cal means of the cinema.28 In Ger- man usage film ex- o h G n cine pressionism at least is restricted to the films of the Weimar Republic that emerged from the tradition of Expres- ,iremhilds Rache ist cinema end here? sionistic literature, fist cine ma end here? Epaining and painting and theatre, but such a definition, too, avoids both their media specificity and the actual content and canon of the expres- sionist cinema. As a result, film expressionism entered critical discourse with multiple meanings: to describe a body of films with fantastical motifs, to define the technical effects of artificially stylised images and/or to describe an umbrella concept that includes expressionst narrative films with fan- tastic and with realistic tendencies. For the German cinema the expressionist films proved once and for all the ability of the camera to move beyond the function of simply recording reality. Their particular combination of technology and aesthetic imagination derived neither from references to literary or real sources but from the desire to find visual means of representation that - in a typical modernist strategy - focused on formal issues of the image. Expressionism in all the arts was committed to abstraction, to highlighting the artificial, precarious identity of image and referent. The cinema offered a new scale for the abstraction of referential meaning through the presence of the image. Stark lines and lack of depth are traits that characterise the two-dimen- Marc Silberman 308</page><page sequence="13">What is German in the German cinema? 309 Fig. 5. Essential character traits are conveyed in the rr the eyelids: Conrad Veidt in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligc 1920). sional sense of surface and space in these films. Expressionist acting with its obsessive interiority seems to contradict this surface quality, yet a consideration of the dynamics of body and space in these films reveals on the contrary that the distinctive movements within space were an inte- gral aspect in the search for new, modern forms of expressivity through a new body language corresponding to the more familiar attributes of expressionist mise-en-scene. Expressionist acting owed its formal language primarily to the stage, where acting was con- sidered to have a special affinity to expressionist aesthetics and was reinforced with metaphysical qualities.29 Derived from a critique of the superfi- cial psychological exactitude of naturalist acting and the trivialisation of emotions in neo-romantic acting, expressionist acting was much more stylised and intense in the quality of movement than conventional 'large' gestures or melodramatic act- ing styles. Of course, the actor did not possess any fundamentally new acting instruments. The body, however, was not used to imitate reality or psycho- logical detail but rather to express intense interior states in the form of an abstraction from sensual experience. Hence, gesture was equated with body and the physical body was employed only as the point of departure for a metaphysics of the soul.30 The actor's body, a work of art, became the reservoir for identity and truth. The chal- lenge was to integrate the 3n(Decla organic body into a radically anti-naturalistic aesthetic without having it simply ....s a become an ornament. As in high_ ~ d spexpressionist painting and lit- erature, reduction and con- densation were the main techniques. Coupled with rhythm and tension, the ex- pressionist performance con- sisted of sharp contrasts and oppositions produced by ac- iere raising of celerating or interrupting ri (Decla, movements. Among accom- plished actors the expressio- nist acting style produced intense and rhythmically charged figures with a high degree of suggestivity; poorly trained actors looked like marionnettes with their cramped move- ments. In contrast to theatre actors, the expressionist film actors assumed a rather different role in the hierarchy of aesthetic elements in the film. Here the body was not so much a metaphysical cipher as a formal element within the mise-en-scene that could be coupled with or set off against other elements like set design, objects or spatial relations. The expressionist directors heightened this aspect by extracting individual details of movement in order to reveal hidden meaning or feelings beyond a narrative function. Bending a finger, raising a hand, opening the eyes slowly in Caligari are separate gestures, magnified by close-ups, that are meant to convey essential character traits. The contrast of explosive and catatonic movements in Danton or Raskolnikov corresponds to the climactic narrative moments, creating a mechanical, artifi- cial rhythm rather than an organic one. At other times the actor's body conforms to architectural lines, for example, in Caligari's hesitant shuffling or Cesare's gliding movement along the garden wall. Abrupt, non-organic movements can rein- force the graphic quality of the expressionist What is German in the German cinema? 309</page><page sequence="14">Marc Silberman image, as when the porter in Der letzte Mann is pressed at an oblique angle against the buildings that seem to be collapsing on him. Expressionist film acting was, moreover, a contrastive element within the mise-en-scene. The most expressive movements tended to develop out of static, tranquil moments or in a decelerated rhythm that opposed the body to realistic elements and objects in the image. Similarly, this distinctive acting style was used almost exclusively by the main characters, by the decentred males who needed a special vocabulary for the body to express their erratic psyches. In calculated contrast the secondary characters (and usually all female characters) relied on a naturalistic acting style that positioned them also as the most readily accessible figures for spectator identification. In fact, in some expressionist films even the 'abnormal' protagon- ists resorted to more conventional poses and non- intensive acting in less spectacular moments. These incongruities are not mistakes but rather a strategy that highlights difference, that draws attention to abstraction and focuses for the spectator the con- stitution of the narrative's characters. The integra- tion of stylised movement, mechanistic rhythms and architectural space marks the expressionist cinema as an original and innovative solution to the demands of the cinematic medium before mon- tage emerged as a means of creating meaning and rhythm independent of image composition. The expressionist film actor abstracts from the referential meaning of gestures in order to translate inner, psychic feelings into corporeal intensity, aiming at a new body language beyond the con- ventions of social reality. Hence, the role of the actor and the new acting style within the expres- sionist cinema was central to the modernist strategy for reasserting the autonomy of the subject beyond language. This modern body aimed at dissolving identities and oppositions like in- side/outside, passive/active, awake/asleep or re- ality/hallucination. In other words it became - like the embedded narratives and frame stories, the mise-en-abime effects and the figures of doubling - a vehicle for the representational instability that marked expressionism in general. Exaggeration and excess throw into question the epistemological stability of that which is to be expressed, drawing attention to the 'acting' as performance and thus making obvious the problematic distinction be- tween appearance and truth. Screen presence, be it the actor's face in close-up or the materiality of an object, becomes here the medium of repre- sentation, a semantic vacuum or empty signifier that functions as spectacle, foregrounding the pro- duction of the image. The expressionist cinema in Germany, then, marks a decisive departure from traditional psychologised notions of character derived from the theatre and a specific historical, national contribution to the role of the image in the cinema. Symptomatic for the contemporaneous dis- course concerning the centrality of the body in the cinema was its focus on the metaphysics of the image. This was neither a new nor an original tendency. In the context of the pre-1914 'Autoren- film' already the cinema was variously compared to other pre-linguistic systems of representation with the implication of its freedom from the con- straints of language. The performative and ex- pressive aspects of the human body in modern dance, the synthetic nature of pantomime, the non-verbal emotive power of dreams, the collective consciousness behind folklore and fairy tales were all cited and compared to the cinema's silence as a liberatory feature. Lack of verbal language was not considered to be a deficiency but rather com- pensation for the elitism of book culture and an opening into imaginative playfulness. The sharp division between literary culture and mass enter- tainment predisposed German intellectuals in the early1920s to project their own desire for access to the popular audience into the utopian potential of the cinema as a universal language beyond the constraints of verbalisation.31 Ignoring the indus- trial and technological basis for the production of images, critics understood the gesture as a prime- val linguistic sign and the face as the mirror of the soul, the site of identity and transcendence. They stressed the anthropomorphic, humanist ground- ing of cinema's language; freed from the con- straints of fragmentation and alienation, it promised redemption and human community. B6la Balasz's early theoretical treatise, Der sichtbare Mensch (1924), is a remarkable document of the sophisticated level this discussion reached but it also illustrates how the idealist grounding of the image (in his terms, the physiognomical ex- 310</page><page sequence="15">What is German in the German cinema? 311 pression) maintained the origin of cinematic meaning in the presence of the actor and thus misconstrued the new medial re- lationship between reality and representation that the express- ionist film already presup- posed.32 If the expressionist film's contribution to the German cinema was its ability to articu- late the anxieties of modern sub- jectivity through a profound rethinking of the nature of repre- sentation in image and gesture, it was able to do so only by denying the modernity of the cinema apparatus. Machines, the city - cinema's most adequ- ate metaphors - threatened the autonomy and authenticity of the subject invested in perspectival vision. The cinema's shift away from the psychological and fan- tastical themes of ego destabili- sation to realistic and socially differentiated narratives after mid-decade has been identified with a more general trend to- ward a new objectivity ('Neue Sachlichkeit') that corresponded to economic and political stabili- sation. While the turn to the re- alism of everyday themes and to the world of objects indeed sug- gests a change in the Weimar cinema, the continuities should not be underestimated. Themes Figs. 6 and 7. of urban alienation, stories set in Brooks in Die E the claustrophic family life of the o e emale petty bourgeoisie, even the focus on details and objects within the image remained relatively constant throughout the Wei- mar period. Two developments, however, did usher in a fundamentally new perspective that definitively recognised the realism of the medium in the technology of the apparatus.

The camera's unchaining, demonstrated to such spectacular effect by cameraman Karl Freund and director Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau in Der letzte Mann (1924), achieved a highpoint in ex- pressivity for dynamic space relations and passion- What is German in the German cinema? 311</page><page sequence="16">312 ate emotions. The expressionist abstraction of ges- ture and image encountered here a technological advance that transformed the quantitative intensity of feeling into a new quality of psychological mimesis. Simultaneously it replaced the actor (the human being) with the camera (the technical ap- paratus) as the producer of meaning. The smooth transition between physical spaces and psycho- logical spaces showed that the camera had become unchained not so much from its mechan- ical constraints but rather from the anthropomor- phic, humanistic model of perspectival representation inherited from nineteenth-century painting. Similarly, the Soviet model of montage was enthusiastically embraced by spectators and film producers in Germany after the release of Sergei's Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin in 1926 as a promising alternative both to the pictorial expressionist style and to the melodramatic Ameri- can style of filmmaking. Despite the documentary quality of the image posited in the objective, registering perspective of the camera's eye, mon- tage editing was not primarily concerned with the reproduction of the object or event in its detail but rather with connecting them through movement and rhythm between images. The new visual con- ventions that began to emerge in the German cinema around 1925 extended the constructivist, dynamic principles of mise-en-scene in the early Weimar period into the calculated effects of anti- thesis, collision and elliptical intervals introduced by montage principles. Thus, both the unchained camera and montage aimed at activating specta- torial activity by means of optical dynamics that worked against contemplative lethargy and emo- tionalism. The abstract rhythms and compositional con- trasts between images did not reproduce reality but constructed spectatorship as a way of en- countering the modern world. The tempo of space and time flow itself revealed the realism of the apparatus, paradigmatically so in the case of Walter Ruttmann's constructivist study Berlin, Sym- phonie einer Grof3stadt (1928). This had enor- mous implications for the spectator's relationship to the actor's body. Intentional acting and the camera's focus on affective movement were con- fined to the aesthetics of the image and this image assumed its significance as an independent ex- pression through gestural language. With the dissi- pation of expressionist interiority the body became a construction site for staging the personality that consists of parts molded together by the camera. It is no accident that this shift in the function of the actor's body is most evident in the fetishisation of the female star. The construction of female beauty, e.g. Brigitte Helm in Metropolis (1927) or Louise Brooks in Die Buchse der Pandora (1929), reflects the radical fragmentation of the modern person- ality, no longer conceived as the autonomous individual. It reveals as well the new quality of the cinematic image that disassembles its object in order to reconstruct it for the spectator in the quintessential position of the modernist, prepared to consume social experience as an aesthetic one. IV Der nationale Held der ganzen ibrigen Welt ist Charlie Chaplin.33 With the introduction of sound a new source of technology determined the next phase of the cinema's development. Germany had become in the course of the 1920s Hollywood's major Euro- pean competitor in the production of long silent features. The combination of professionalism, careful attention to mise-en-scene and a dynamic sense of editing did not escape the guarded busi- ness sense of the American studio bosses who throughout the decade tried to control the German market by cooptation or cooperation. The German producers were in turn both fascinated and re- pulsed by the efficiency and technical ability of the American studio films. Their ambitious spectacles, the international productions of the 'Film Europa' movement, the sophisticated art films were all aimed at the export market. In fact, the movement of ideas, personnel, styles, genres and influences was so globalised that the very notion of national cinema particularity had to be sought at the level of content (literary and dramatic sources for screenplays) and politics (historical and contem- porary allusions to the increasingly polarised so- cial situation). Meanwhile, the real national (i.e. local) achievement of the German silent cinema was to construct a line of historical continuity from the traditional arts to the new medium against the Marc Silberman</page><page sequence="17">What is German in the German cinema? 313 resistance and fear of dehumanisation on the part of literary and intellectual elites. Industrial produc- tion, mechanical reproduction, commodity circula- tion and commercialisation had no place in the conventional understanding of art's autonomy from the metaphysical perspective of German idealism, but the cinema became during the 1920s the most convincing argument for a modernist perception of culture that at one and the same time reproduced the experience of modern life and offered strategies for surviving it. Sound technol- ogy changed the equation in two important ways. No longer a mere supplement to the silent cinema, it demanded a new aesthetics that could combine sound and image to produce the dimension of acoustical space. The process proceeded quickly in the German cinema and proved once again that technology inspired rather than hampered aes- thetic progress. Equally important, the new tech- nology led to a reorganisation of the cinema distribution and exhibition markets. Initially it seemed as if the sound film would throw the international cinema back into national spheres of production based on language compatibility, but in fact this was not the case. More serious for the relationship of global and local developments was the retreat to political protectionism and censor- ship with the rise of fascism in Europe. The German cinema is German, but have I succeeded in showing what makes it German? As I stated at the outset, the issue is not so much to deny or qualify the various answers that have been proposed in the past but rather to demonstrate how the very formulation of the question, the form of the question, tends to determine the way it is answered. Germany's historical trajectory in this century during which the cinema has come of age may strike many as extreme and therefore unrep- resentative for the general issue of national cinema history. Yet its encounter with modernism through the cinema brings into high relief a set of factors and contradictions which bound together the dis- courses of cinema and nation, of global interest and national identity. Tracing the way in which these discourses sought to make sense of a speci- fically historical and national development sheds light on the categories which constitute national cinema histories.o Notes 1.
