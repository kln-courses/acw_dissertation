As Lippard noted in a footnote, the article provided the basis for lectures she gave at the University of California in Berkeley and at the Los Angeles County Museum in the summer of 1966 as well as the exhibition at the Fischbach Gallery in the autumn. There was a similar text expounding the basic ideas of the show that accompanied the pink soft vinyl announcement for it, and this Lippard quotes from later in her book Eva Hesse, (Da Capo Press: New York, 1976). 2. Lippard, 'Eccentric Abstraction', p. 28. 3. Lippard, 'Eccentric Abstraction', p. 34. For the critic Lucy Lippard, Louise Bourgeois held a special position in the 'Eccentric Abstraction' show which she organized at the Fischbach Gallery in New York in 1966. Thankfully the title did not stick, but the exhibition brought together the work of a group of artists including Eva Hesse and Bruce Nauman, mainly younger artists except for Bourgeois, whose resonance continues to be intensely felt in the work of any number of artists. If objecthood was a term used to describe the literalness of the object, its mere thing-like status, then this work moved beyond objecthood, not by repairing the rift and returning to the object its aesthetic plenitude, but by taking it even further down the road of literalness itself and into a realm of excessive, bodily materiality. In so doing, it laid the ground for a whole range of work which has subsequently come to be labelled Postminimalist. The moment is mythic in so far as it has come to be charged with the significance of revealing all that Minimal art itself had sought to repress. Certainly Lippard initially set up the show as an alternative to 'dead-set Minimalism' and to the 'rigours of structural art'.1 As she described it in the essay she wrote in Art International, whilst 'Eccentric Abstraction' shared some common ground with 'primary structures', it also shared some of Pop's perversity and a fundamentally Surrealist concern with the 'reconciliation of distant realities'.2 The opposition to Minimalism, that has since become rather too firmly entrenched in the critical imagination, must have been vividly staged, not least by the coincidence that 'Ten', the show Ad Reinhardt helped to organize, was showing at the same building at the Dwan Gallery, and showing some of that 'dead-set' minimal art at its best, with Judd, Morris, LeWitt and so on. Small as her works were, just visible on the left hand side of the installation photograph and completely dwarfed by Frank Viner's hanging pieces, Bourgeois' position in the show as an older artist made her both participant and precedent. According to Lippard, her work had tended in the direction of 'Eccentric Abstraction' since the 1940s because of its visceral bodily qualities, as well as a direct link to European Surrealism and work such as Meret Oppenheim's Fur Teacup. 'Organic', 'erotic', 'sensuous': these were the words Lippard used to describe the work in this idiom and the 'near-visceral identification with form' that has the capacity to activate the most powerful physical sensation.3 Yet it was Eva Hesse whose work seems to have been at the back of Lippard's mind throughout, especially pieces like Several (Fig. 1) and Ingeminate, both of which ended up in the show. She refers to this as the 'organic' work which Hesse had been producing over the previous year to explain why initially she was unprepared for the very large piece Metronomic Irregularity (Fig. 2) which Hesse also exhibited. Several was made by laying papier-mache over rubber hose and painting over it with shiny acrylic black through to matte grey. It hangs on strings, hooked up to the top of the wall. Its shapes as well as its textures, like the painted papier-mache or the straggling bits of rope or the shapes bound round and round with string, signalled very clearly the alternative to 'dead-set' minimalism.

But of course, the formal is intimately bound up in a language of description, in this case a vocabulary of description which invests form with a palpable sense of bodily states, bodily parts, and bodily functions like breathing. It was also a show that was adamantly abstract, with Lippard claiming that abstraction could be a 'more potent vehicle of the unfamiliar' than figuration.5 Artists like Westerman and Kusama, though she talks about them in the article as close relations and even precedents for some of this work, were left out because they were figurative. And she famously claimed 'In eccentric abstraction, evocative qualities or specific organic associations are kept at a subliminal level, without the benefit of Freudian clergy. Ideally a bag remains a bag and does not become a uterus, a tube is a tube and not a phallic symbol.'6 l For all its critical force, by the early 1970s Lippard was taking this back word for word, picking over the very phrase as if to make clear the bench mark it represented. In an essay of 1975, she says she can simply no longer support that claim: ' . . . the time has come', she wrote, 'to call a semisphere a breast if we know damn well that's what it suggests, instead of suppressing the association and negating an area of experience that has been dormant except in the work of a small number of artists, many of them women' .7 That is, damn it, a breast is a breast, or so it seemed as she looked back and accused herself of too much compromise with a Minimalist aesthetic (she was also writing by now about artists like Judy Chicago whose work demanded a different kind of language). Lippard's politicization as a feminist demanded precisely, at that ng. 1.

That is, what seems interesting now is not to think in terms of a subject matter but of how the work places the subject or spectator, how it might incur the coming-into-being of the subject - in particular the feminine subject. If Lippard's sense of what was pressing was to place the body and the erotic at the centre of contemporary art, then the question which presses more urgently now is this: where is the subject to be placed? That is, the question which arises now is not so much how the work of these artists fit together, but instead something of the strange encounters that were set up, principally in the encounter of Bourgeois and Hesse and what I want to suggest are their quite different ways of situating the subject or spectator within the field of vision. A starting point might be Mel Bochner's comments, the tone of which Lucy Lippard grants gets closer to the work than her own epithet 'eccentric abstraction'. Admiring Hesse's work as the best in the show, Bochner came up with a stark observation of its emptiness: 'Regular, remote, lifeless. Her other pieces, atrophied organs and private parts, encased in string and painted black are not garish and horrifying'. They had, he said, a sort of 'detached presence'.9 This remark is suggestive precisely because it points away from the continual re-play of bodily empathies towards what we might describe in terms not of an encounter replete with meaning, but one in which there is an element of detachment, in which something is taken away, almost a piece taken out of the encounter. A detachment that interrupts the constant circling of bodily empathies; not a filling up but a making a hole in; not a directness but a kind of opacity. Contradictorily, then, to be in the picture is to be out of the picture. What seems interesting now is not simply how the body comes to be placed in the work, but how it does so only to expose a fundamental absence in the bits and pieces of subjectivity that seem to get detached in the process. The whole question of 'Soft Sculpture' would invite a language of anthropomorphism, of bodily projection and empathy. Bulbous forms, organic forms, seemed deliberately to inscribe an erotics of the body. Even when most insistent on the qualities of form, she cannot avoid the literalism demanded by Bourgeois.0 Lippard talked of Bourgeois' 'overtly sexual membranes'. She tries in her language to make equally explicit the sexual connotations of '"crowds" of breast-phallus protrusions, finger-like growth ... ', like Double Negative (Fig. 3), as she writes in her 1975 Artforum article on Bourgeois. Of the latex pieces one has 'a slit into a labial interior', referring to Le Regard (Fig. 4). She used hyphens a lot: 'breast-phallus protrusions' or 'hill-breast-clouds' of Cumulous. 1 It is as if these linguistic contractions were needed to express the heightened sense of the bodily, visceral presence of the objects, to circumvent the problem of likeness they embody and express the more-than-likeness, the lack of representation. In a way, it is not the recognition of suppressed imagery that requires such condensation, even for Lippard, so much as the sheer literalness of Bourgeois's work as it is experienced by the viewer. For example, Le Regard is a latex sculpture which insistently figures the eye as a sexual organ, and vice versa. A devouring eye is also devoured, it appears, from within, in this hollowed out cavity which metonymically elides bodily orifices. The eye is libidinized and voracious, the very act of looking pathologized as scopic for the feminine subject. It is the scopic rather than the optical which concerns me, the ways in which the subject is torn apart by the scopic drive in a way that runs quite counter to a notion of bodily empathies and what, in the language of the 1960s, was called 'anthropomorphism'.

(Photograph: Peter Bellamy.) Oldenburg was the artist whose work most readily seemed to exemplify the term 'anthropomorphic'. The critic Max Kozloff was one of many to elaborate a rich repertoire of bodily empathies and identifications in his essay 'Poetics of Soft Sculpture', which he wrote for an exhibition in Los Angeles in 1967. Putting in question the familiar objects of a domestic interior, Oldenburg transformed a fan into a giant, collapsing bodily form - suggestive of fatigue, inertia, deterioration. All bodily affect, yet even Kozloff at one point has to ask what if all this squirming stuff makes the spectator feel not more but less organic?12 Oldenburg was the focus of such criticism, but not exclusively, and the same litany of artists that featured in 'Eccentric Abstraction' in 1966 would feature again, culminating in 1968 in Lucy Lippard's 'Soft and Apparently Soft Sculpture' that would travel all over the States and include, once again, Bourgeois, Hesse, Sonnier, Nauman as well as Kusama and Oldenburg. Oldenburg was seen as a prototype and Lippard placed him at the beginning of her essay 'Eccentric Abstraction' essay in relation to Dali, who had made a fur-lined bath for a window display in 1941: 'The viewer was invited figuratively to immerse himself in a great fur womb, as he was 25 years later invited by Claes Oldenburg's gleaming, flexible blue and white vinyl bathtub'.13 It seemed clear that this kind of relation to the object came from Surrealism, just as it seemed clear that it entailed breaking with certain fundamental protocols of modernist distance and disinterestedness. Anthropomorphism is a loaded and ubiquitous term; it veers from something very very good to something very very bad. The same year, 1967, 12.

Caillois discusses the three types of mimicry which he defines as camouflage, travesty and intimidation in 'Les Trois Fonctions de Mimetisme' in Meduse et Cie', p. 81 et passim. See also 'Mimicry and Legendary Psychasthenia' translated in Annette Michelson, Rosalind Krauss, Douglas Crimp and Joan Copjec (eds.), October The First Decade, (MIT: Cambridge, MA and London, UK, 1987), pp. 58-74. Michael Fried proffers the most anthropomorphic reading of Minimalism in order, precisely, to establish its 'latent anthropomorphism'.14 That is, the anthropomorphism of Minimal art lies not in its residual connotations of bodily form but in the looming presence of objects which appear as actors might on a stage. The literalness of the object, mere objecthood, is sustained only by recourse to a highly metaphorized account of the encounter with the object - a theatrical encounter involving a monstrous body. On the other hand, Robert Smithson was equally insistent that Hesse avoided the anthropomorphic in her Laokoon.1s Whatever we make of claim and counter-claim, what is obvious is that the anthropomorphic mattered, though quite why is less clear. In an obvious way, this has to do with the associations of certain kinds of 'organic' form- straggly bits as opposed to straight bits, soft, bulging surfaces as opposed to hard ones and so on. Yet these oppositions tend to keep the conventional relationship between subject and object intact, even though they may be now tuned to a rhythm of echoes in bodily states and movements. It was precisely a kind of superficial anthropomorphism from which Judd and Smithson and Hesse and even Bourgeois wanted to distance themselves. On the other hand, we might think of another kind of anthropomorphism, the kind claimed as central by the Surrealist writer Roger Caillois, whose understanding of the anthropomorphic was entirely in terms of the spatial lure of the subject, the way in which the subject could inhabit their surroundings. Anthropomorphism, to Caillois, is the very antithesis of anthropocentrism, which is the presumption of the individual and the centrality of man. In his model of mimicry, Caillois describes the way an insect which changes colour through camouflage does so in order to become invisible; as it disappears, it loses irreparably its distinctness.16 Rather than a sign for its surroundings, camouflage acts as a negative signifier, a sign of non-being, which effaces rather Flg. 4.

This desire for self-effacement is the opposite of the kinds of bodily empathies I have been describing so far as anthropomorphic, but corresponds far more closely with the spatial lure of the objects under discussion here. It runs quite counter to the kinds of erotic identification that Lippard had intended, and requires us to think rather differently the disjunction between desire and drive, especially as it might be played out in relation to femininity. This sense of mimetic compulsion is not a matter of the art object carrying associations to or connoting things in the world, as we might understand resemblance; rather, it has to do with the coming-into-being of the subject in the scopic field, on the understanding that the scopic field is something we inhabit and which we cannot view from outside. It is Bourgeois' latex works from the 'Eccentric Abstraction' show, and a small group of works produced shortly after it, that I want to think about from this point of view. Bourgeois had exhibited her latex pieces before at the Stable Gallery show in 1964. These were a series of latex moulds, flesh-coloured or earth-coloured, 'small, flattish, fluid moulds' according to Lippard.'7 Here in Eccentric Abstraction, she showed Portrait from 1963, the latex piece that belonged to her friend Arthur Drexler (Fig. 5). With its untidy edges curling out, this is like some shiny, lumpy blister, which erupts off the surface of the wall, interrupting the wall as a picture might. It is made of latex, the cast off mould of one of her plaster torsos. It is both crumpled and smooth, a latex cast taken from one of her hanging objects. Though it protrudes out from the wall, it has the quality of an inside of something. Merleau-Ponty once described how we can imagine parts of the body that we have never seen and how certain people could hallucinate 'their own face seenfrom inside'. l Like other works from this time, Portrait hangs from the wall as a picture but also like a carcass. Like Hesse's work, they are situated between image and object. Or rather, they hang on the wall like an image but they function as an object, protruding into the spectator's visual field. There is lack of distance determined by the object's relatively small scale which causes the object, viewed from close-up, to take on magnified proportions in the imagination, quite disproportionate to its actual size. Latex or liquid rubber is a casting material and it is a material which behaves in odd ways. It can be poured or painted. It has a viscosity which solidifies in time; it is skin-like, mostly like a shed skin with raw unfinished edges. Latex was considered soft, in contrast to a hard dry material like plaster. Sometimes, as in Soft Landscape from 1963 (Fig. 6), she mixed the two. Hesse discovered latex later than Bourgeois, in the autumn of 1967, though Nauman had already used latex for his streamers with a cloth backing in the 'Eccentric Abstraction' show. Hesse painted latex on like paint, and liked the translucency of latex, which in time turns syrupy brown, but even the potential change that would inevitably happen to the material appealed to her. For Hesse, latex was close to painting and could even reiterate that moment when the fluidity of paint freezes in time and hardens, that was captured in Pollock's drips.19 Hesse liked the way you could alter the colour and the translucency depending on the proportion of rubber to filler.20 For Bourgeois, on the other hand, it was how the material seemed to perform - the viscosity of the pouring, the event of its malleable action - of which she spoke: 'The poured form is stretched from the inside and obeys the laws of gravity' or the way 'hot wax poured into freezing water will assume a unique shape'21. In Bourgeois, latex does not so much bear the mark of touch - it is not modelled - as act out its previous liquidity, of wetness, of bodily secretions which make the skin of surface bulge and almost 17.

According to Lippard, Bourgeois thought about getting a performer dressed in a latex mould to act out the symbolic origins of the work, soft plaster turning hard, reverting to soft in a latex mould, then to hard marble and so on. Lippard said some of them hung on the wall like memories of performances.22 One could go further and say that the work is performative rather than sculptural in Bourgeois' very approach to materials, as so many props in the imagination, so many materials for the body to mimic; not so much a matter of creating new forms out of new materials, as destroying one material in favour of another, trading in and off obsolescence, not just using but making cast-offs. The combination of hard and soft, wet and dry, animates much of Bourgeois' work, even when it is not made of latex. The way hard materials like bronze or plastic are made to mimic soft ones in her various Soft Landscapes is an example of this and part and parcel of her literalist approach, paradoxical as that may be. This is quite a different effect from that of Hesse's work, even though there is in both a similar movement between the works in different Fig. 5.

But in Hesse the relationship of image to object is one of mutual cancellation: a draining of the body's substance. In Bourgeois' work, there simply is not that contradiction. Materials heighten and even exaggerate the qualities of lumpenness or collapse that the shapes would suggest rather than work against them. As a result, there is a disintegration but not the same evacuation of meaning. To exaggerate the difference for a moment, we could invoke what Robert Ryman seemed to see in Hesse's work. Then married to Lippard and with a studio in the same Bowery building as Hesse, Ryman traded one of his paintings in return for an unfinished work by Hesse, still all white plaster. Ryman preferred the white papier-mache shell without the cord to some of the finished pieces which she was making out of papier-mache over balloons, the kind in the 'Eccentric Abstraction' show, but without the string bound around it.23 What Ryman saw, I would suggest, was there, latent, as the shell of Hesse's work, a claim we could never make of Bourgeois' white 23.

In Bourgeois' hands, white plaster is somehow just as awkward, just as resistant to immateriality, as anything else. On the other hand, that axis between too much material presence and too little is dramatised by Kusama, another of the artists cited by Lippard as a precursor of 'Eccentric Abstraction' (though, like others ruled out because of their figuration). Like Hesse, Kusama had, since 1961, created sculptures which combined object and monochrome- both to exacerbate the sense of bodily affect and at the same time to cancel it out through serial repetition. Like Bourgeois', the work was characterized by bunching bulbous forms protruding from a slack surface which Lippard calls her 'phallus-studded furniture'.24 But her objects- a large table, a chair- covered in white protuberances, interested Judd because of their 'obsessive repetition' where the 'masses of white protuberances are more alike than the underlying forms are unlike',25 a kind of obsessive repetition that can also be linked to Lucas Samaras' pin-covered objects. Judd draws attention to the emptying out of meaning through the very serial repetition which puts the masses of phallic shapes in place. This is not just a question of emphasis, but of how we might go on to understand the work's effects in relation to the place of the subject. Andre Green has coined the term 'une angoisse blanche' to describe the anxiety of separation distinct from the anxiety of castration - though both are forms of detachment.26 In French, the word 'blanc' means both white and blank and this approximation to the double function of the monochrome seems to be brought into play and set against the function of the object as body, or the bodily analogy of interior-exterior, for example, or Kusama's dresses, shed skins which hang on the wall. In what he calls the 'serie blanc' he counts negative hallucinations which Freud had first talked about in connection with the hysteric. Negative hallucinations are where portions of the field of vision may simply be cut out, scotomized. If we think of the subject in these terms she is but an imprint or stain within the scopic field. This is reminiscent of Caillois' mimetic compulsion in which a subject is rendered invisible. But the example of hallucinations gives more force - appropriately here I think - to that swing between an intensification of vision, the exaggeration of bits like the bulbous protrusions in Kusama, to a kind of blanking and the exacerbation of what Andre Green talks of as 'trous psychiques' in negative hallucinations. For all that 'Eccentric Abstraction' was criticised for being 'sick',27 pre-empting as it were a culture of trauma, this blanking, or effacing of the subject, was its other face. So what of Bourgeois within this economy? If one asks from what point of view is the object the object of a sadistic destructive drive then the answer has to be only from the infantile and that is the point of view Bourgeois unmasks, or more precisely, acts out in a performative gesture. And what she unmasks is the scopic drive as it might operate for a feminine subject; the scopic, that is, not the optical; the scopic, that is, not bodily empathy; the scopic, that is, as partial drive, with all the force that carries with it of a pathologized feminine subject for whom looking is a form of destruction as it is a form of pleasure. The Imaginary is that realm within the psychoanalytic field in which aggression is the necessary corollary to the narcissistic structure of the coming-into-being of the subject. This fantasy of the fragmented body became the model of disintegration in art in the 1980s, but which Bourgeois had explored in the work that I have looked at here. The Imaginary is the realm Klein described in terms of the falling to bits of the ego. Within the realm of the Imaginary, which is where Bourgeois's work has to be placed I think,28 the subject may identify with precisely what is repellent as a kind of pleasure, still within the OXFORD ART JOURNAL 22.2 1999 35</page><page sequence="10">Briony Fer register of the pleasure principle, of desire. But the other model which emerged at that same moment - that moment of the 'Eccentric Abstraction' show - was not so much the disintegration of the subject-into-pieces but the drive to self-effacement. This signals the unfolding of a model of non- integration as the subject is both caught and effaced in what Smithson called the 'lost tempo' of Hesse's Metronomic Irregularity (Fig. 2).29 The breast is not a breast, damn it, when it is also a serial monochrome object. It is not a question of an image that is latent. It is both less than a breast in that what we encounter is a series of substitutions, latex, string whatever, something inanimate, and more than a breast in that it is much more like a breast than a picture of a breast might be, operating as it does as the lost object par excellence, what Torok and Abraham have called 'the lost object- me'.3 It is that border between desire in all its destructive forms which is where Bourgeois would seem to situate us, and the more than pleasure or jouissance which is where Hesse's work touches on drive that we might think of as a kind of fault-line or interval within subjectivity itself. As I have tried to describe it, that interval is between desire and drive, and between disintegration and detachment. I would not want to overstate it, or set up another set of oppositions, so much as suggest that the work shown at 'Eccentric Abstraction' played between these poles, and so within a fractured subjectivity. Perhaps what is most interesting is how work gets made out of such negativity; how work gets made, that is, whose effects are neither simply reparative nor simply - at the other end of the scale - desublimatory. Detachment ends up being not just a necessary cost but also a gain - a condition of viewing objects that would deal not with bodily empathies so much as what gets lost in the very processes of identification, lost in the sense of falling into pieces of a subject in disintegration, as in Bourgeois, or a subject who is effaced and rendered invisible in Hesse. Detachment in these terms, then, is anything but neutral. Rather, it is the very presence of the object that heightens the sense of losing a portion of oneself. From this point of view, although the work of Louise Bourgeois is usually characterised as being somehow more direct and less mediated than the work of others, that is not really what is different about her. What is different, particularly at this moment in the mid-sixties when her work seems closest to the work of a range of younger artists, is the way her work stages or performs its disintegrating effects that mark her out. 29.
