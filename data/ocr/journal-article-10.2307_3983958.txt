<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Laborers of Nature Economic Ornithology and the Role of Birds as Agents of Biological Pest Control in North American Agriculture, ca. 1880-1930 Matthew D. Evenden A griculture has been blamed, on occasion, for creating its own pests. In 1864 George Perkins Marsh wrote in Man and Nature that "[w]ith the cultivated plants of man come the myriad tribes which feed or breed upon them, and agri- culture not only introduces new spe- cies, but so multiplies the number of individuals as to defy calculation."1 Since early in the twentieth century, the solution to insect pests in North American agriculture has been the heavy use of insecticides. Although biological control techniques were important early in the century and have become a focus of attention more recently, the place of insecticides in the twentieth-century history of agricultural pest control is central and remains so. Over the past twenty years, envi- ronmental and agricultural historians have sought to analyze the origin and course of pest control regimes in modern North American agricul- ture.2 They have placed particular emphasis on determining why over the course of the past century pesti- cides came to prevail in pest control regimes. Historians have proposed a variety of possible factors, including the role of agribusiness and state- funded science in institutionalizing and promoting pesticides, the cachet of pesticide research in entomologi- cal science following World War II, and the attractiveness of pesticides to farmers. Less attention within this overarching question has been given to the history of biological control, and even when it has been consid- ered, the definition of biological con- trol has been narrowly conceived.3 With rare exceptions, biological pest control has been understood to be the use of insect predators (whether introduced into an ecosystem or emergent through habitat modifica- tion) in the control of insect or weed pests. This definition, although it covers the broad scope of biological control, ignores various other tech- niques on its margins. One of these other, marginal techniques is the role of birds as agents of biological control. In the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, scientific ideas about this method of pest control developed within the context of popular debates over bird preservation and conserva- tion generally. These ideas, although predominantly generated in the United States, were diffused and debated in the Canadian and American agricul- tural literature, with little respect for political borders. Avian agent biological control has long been used throughout the world in forestry and has received attention recently in the integrated pest management literature.4 But in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries the notion of using birds to help control pests, among the gamut of methods that were proposed and debated within the agricultural litera- ture, commanded significant atten- tion.5 Growing out of the natural historical concern for teleological design in nature and debates over bird importation, systematic studies of the potential role of birds as pest control agents were first produced 172 Forest &amp; Conservation History 39 (October 1995)</page><page sequence="2">in the 1880s and embodied in the newly named field called economic ornithology. From the late-nineteenth century to the 1930s, when this field practically disappeared, hundreds of studies on the role of birds in agri- culture were published. This research had implications for conservation politics and was popularized in the natural historical and agricultural literature through two strands of conservationist discourse. One pos- ited birds as humanlike moral agents; the other constructed birds as natu- ral resources. By the 1930s, however, depic- tions of birds as beneficent laborers declined, as did the claims of scien- tific "knowledge" upon which they were based. The emerging dominance of pesticides was clearly crucial to this change. But economic ornithology also collapsed because of three other important factors: first, economic ornithology did not offer practical methods for harnessing the role of birds as insect eaters; second, debate among ornithologists in the early- twentieth century over data analysis methods destabilized the claims of the field as a whole; and third, the weakening political status of the U.S. Biological Survey in the 1930s undermined economic ornithology's institutional base. It is tempting to blame pesticides for displacing, by the 1940s, biological control research and practice. But the history of eco- nomic ornithology demonstrates that internal aspects of the science along with the then-current political con- text were important factors that weakened the legitimacy of biologi- cal control prior to the triumph of pesticides. The Cultural Background of Economic Ornithology The proposition that birds are useful agents of insect control has a long history. From the mid-eighteenth century, naturalists ranging from Benjamin Franklin to Bernadin de Saint-Pierre proclaimed the virtue of birds, based upon teleological assump- tions about the order and economy of providential nature.6 "Birds," wrote Swiss naturalist Frederic De Tschudi in the mid-nineteenth cen- tury, "are nature's soldiers and keep in subjection the inferior animals."7 Every aspect of their being, such authors argued, was fitted to a higher purpose, since nature did nothing in vain. In order to control insect pests, De Tschudi continued, "the most essential of [birds'] organs have been adapted-their sight is piercing, and even the very smallest among them possess the most extraordinary pow- ers of digestion-whilst their great activity and lightness enable them to exercise their calling incessantly and where most required."8 Before Dar- win, and even in his wake, natural historians interpreted the economy of nature as a grand set of cycles in which God's magnificence revealed itself.9 Birds, according to this line of thought, provided an essential function in maintaining the harmo- nious balance of nature, and deserved human protection and encourage- ment in their blessed project. This view of the beneficent role of birds lay behind attempts to propa- gate foreign species within regions of European settlement in the nineteenth century. Mynas were introduced to Australia to control locusts; starlings were brought to North America to help control shade tree pests; and English sparrows, one the most suc- cessful and widespread of the intro- duced species, were established in Argentina to control moths, in Aus- tralia to attack all varieties of insects, and in the United States and Canada to suppress tree pests and cutworms.10 In the United States starting in the 1850s, such groups as the Society for the Acclimatization of Foreign Birds organized bird importation programs, while commentators trumpeted the cause in the agricultural literature. This enthusiasm for bird importation encompassed both a sincere belief that birds could control insect pests and a sentimental affection for the pastoral European landscapes that imported birds were said to repre- sent. Eugene Scheiffelin, a wealthy New York manufacturer and promi- nent member of the Acclimatization Society, exemplified such conflated goals through his personal attempts to import all bird species mentioned in Shakespeare.12 Although few mir- rored Scheiffelin's romantic enthusi- asm, he personified the "importing mania" that swept the eastern United States in the mid-nineteenth century.13 Despite the initial optimism that surrounded bird importation pro- grams, by the 1870s opinion was divided over whether introduction schemes were worthwhile. In par- ticular, questions about the relation of the English sparrow to agricul- tural economy inspired heated debate in the agricultural press and natural history journals. Between 1867 and 1879, periodicals and newspapers in the United States published almost one hundred ninety articles on the subject.14 The combatants termed the debate "the Sparrow War," and a literary battle it was indeed. Pro- ponents of the sparrow elevated its noble service as a controller of pests; those who denigrated the bird's per- formance in this regard blamed it for consuming farmers' grain and driving out native birds from their favored haunts. Those who attempted to dis- credit the English sparrow painted their attacks in the nativist imagery usually reserved for human immi- grants of the period. The English sparrow was thus portrayed as an ungrateful foreigner, taking from America what it did not return; it crowded urban centers and was said to drive out upright avian citizens. If this were not bad enough, the English sparrow immigrant shirked its duties as a "contract laborer" and was hardly better in the eyes of its critics than America's native "black," the crow.15 This anthropomorphic appropria- tion of racist and classist imagery helps to reveal the social background of the natural history literati involved in this political episode, but it also demonstrates the profoundly moral and political terms in which the "sparrow question" was conceived. As scientific investigators were drawn to examine the role of sparrows and other birds in agricultural economy during this period, the moral problem was transferred into the supposedly disinterested and systematic investiga- Economic Ornithology 173</page><page sequence="3">tions of scientific economic ornithol- ogy. The science of economic ornithol- ogy was established to determine the morality of the economy of nature. Although some early systematic studies in economic ornithology pre- dated the 1870s, it was during and following the Sparrow War that eco- nomic ornithology developed as a scientific field with a theoretical basis and an institutional setting. Before the 1880s the concepts underlying economic ornithological investiga- tions were broad and ill defined. Early investigators during the 1860s and 1870s, such as Samuel Aughey and Wilson Flagg, took it for granted that birds "performed certain services in the economy of nature, which [could not] be so well accomplished by any other species."16 Against this background of studies that demon- strated a conceptual affinity with a natural historical teleology, investi- gators in the early-1880s submitted such hallowed assumptions to rigor- ous reinterpretation. The most impor- tant new student of the field, who reoriented its theoretical basis, was Stephen Forbes, a polymath entomol- ogist, limnologist, and ornithologist who directed the Illinois State Labo- ratory of Natural History in the late- nineteenth century.17 Although other contemporary researchers, such as the Wisconsin-based agronomist Franklin H. King, made important contributions, it was the work of Forbes that economic ornithologists later held out as the theoretical cor- nerstone of the field." Birth of a Science The work of Stephen Forbes, published in a series of papers in the early-1880s, reinterpreted the latest theoretical approaches in population biology and applied those theories to specific empirical case studies."9 Forbes's work rested on his own theoretical "first principles" laid out in a paper entitled "On Some Inter- actions of Organisms" published in 1880. Forbes attempted in that paper to synthesize Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection with Herbert Spencer's notion of a "balance of forces" as developed in Spencer's treatise on biology.20 Forbes's prob- lem was to account for the concept of equilibrium in primeval Nature, in light of evolution and natural selection. He argued that natural selection was a regulative tool that furthered natural equilibrium by adjusting reproductive rates in con- gruence with mortality rates and weeding out disruptive organisms that disturbed the "common interest" of population maintenance.21 Put more simply, Forbes theorized that predator species "A," dependent upon prey species "B," would arrive at an optimum balance between its own consumption and reproduction patterns and the reproductive capac- ity of its prey so that its own popu- lation levels could be maintained. Species that did not conform to these rules-either because they consumed too much or reproduced too quickly- would destroy their food base and thereby submit to the harmonizing force of natural selection, which meant that better-adjusted species would squeeze them out of existence. Although Forbes's preliminary under- standing helped to establish why populations of organisms supposedly were not in constant stages of flux, and why they supposedly tended toward harmony, it did not account for how occasional disturbances to equilibrium conditions, such as insect outbreaks, were eventually controlled. For, according to Forbes's under- standing of the "common interest" it would be impossible to expect preda- tors that were primarily dependent upon a given insect to diminish their prey population beyond a certain threshold since this would undercut their own food supply. To find the natural control for this anomaly relative to the "common interest" principle, Forbes suggested looking to mixed feeders that could flexibly redirect their dietary patterns to dampen population explosions with- out ineluctably destroying the basis of their own population.22 Of the mixed feeders, Forbes sug- gested that birds, with their locomo- tive power, were fitted "above all other animals and agencies, to arrest [insect population] disorder at the start,-to head off aspiring and destructive rebellion before it has had time to fairly make head."23 By deducing the supposed function of birds in nature in relation to contem- porary developments in population biology, Forbes provided a rationale for economic ornithology that dis- tanced it from the questioned suppo- sitions of natural history but kept intact the belief in the positive role of birds in nature. However, he did not present his theoretical first prin- ciples as laws, and undertook a series of empirical investigations to verify his hypotheses. He understood that the central question of economic ornithology-do birds do ill or good in agriculture?-was of such complex- ity, relating as it did to the life history of birds, the agricultural geography of different regions, and the charac- teristics of insect population dynam- ics, that a holistic conception of natural phenomena was essential. "The first, indispensable requisite," he wrote, "is a thorough knowledge of the natural order, an intelligently conducted natural survey. "24 Economic Ornithology and the Biological Survey Although scientists both in the United States and Canada carried out a series of natural and geological surveys before the mid-1880s, few provided a systematic or comprehen- sive faunal survey.25 In the United States, some states funded individual projects that related local fauna to agricultural economy, but in Canada government support for this type of research was almost nonexistent.26 The American Ornithologists' Union (AOU), established in 1883 as the successor to the Nuttal Ornithological Club of Cambridge, Massachusetts, offered the most concerted effort to redress this apparent deficiency. Of the projects that the AOU attempted to organize in its first years, one related to the geographic distribution of birds in North America, another to the study of bird migration, and a third to the economic status of the English sparrow. This third project drew directly on the Sparrow War controversy, and the AOU envisioned 174 Forest &amp; Conservation History 39 (October 1995)</page><page sequence="4">it as the scientific final word on the debate. These projects quickly out- stripped the AOU's meager resources, since they entailed collecting and assessing information and specimens from twelve hundred correspondents throughout the United States and Canada. In order to contain this expanded research program, the AOU appealed to Congress in 1885 for funding to support the research. After initial denials, the group secured a modest appropriation through the United States Department of Agri- culture (USDA), thanks to political support provided by AOU friends in Congress and government entomolo- gists active in researching the role of birds in insect control. As a result, in 1885 the AOU transferred most of its research, then under the leadership of Clint Hart Merriam, to the USDA under the auspices of the Division of Entomology. The following year, the USDA established a separate Division of Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy (which later became the Division of Biological Survey [in 1896] and then the Bureau of Biologi- cal Survey [1905-39]).27 Although the division had a broad mandate, which wildlife control projects came to dominate in later years, throughout its history it provided institutional legitimacy to the study of the relation of birds to agriculture. The division's first major study of economic ornithology, published in 1889, was a comprehensive bulletin on the bird that had helped spawn the agency: the English sparrow.28 It contained a plethora of unfavorable evidence, which more than thirty-three hundred correspondents in the United States and Canada had collected since 1883. Interpretive passages discussed the importation, spread, and natural checks against the bird, as well as the bird's effects on agricultural crops and insects.29 The bulletin's authors saw such a mammoth display of data and testimony as the only way to dispel what they took to be the irra- tional remnants of sentimentality for the English sparrow. The bulletin's principal editor and author, Walter B. Barrows, hoped that the bulletin would conclude the Sparrow War. "The history of the Sparrow contro- versy in America," he wrote, shows plainly...that it would be folly to expect all friends of the Sparrow to accept our conclusions as to its characteristics and habits. There are some persons whose minds are so constituted, that nothing is evidence to them except what is derived from their own observation, and as this unfortu- nate mental infirmity is commonly correlated with the total inability to observe anything which interferes with their theories, it makes little difference whether their opportunities have been good or bad, their position is unassail- able. With this class of observers we have nothing to do. No amount of evidence will change their opinion, and fortunately for the good of mankind it makes little difference what that opinion may be.30 Barrows was prophetic since the sparrow controversy continued to stir debate in natural history circles until the early-twentieth century, despite the survey's damning analysis. The study of the English sparrow helped provide the impetus for engag- ing a research bureaucracy in the tasks of economic ornithology, but the survey's later economic ornitho- logical studies were generally more of a celebratory nature. The bulletin that followed the English sparrow publication was another weighty tome; it related extensive investiga- tions by Albert K. Fisher on the eco- nomic relations of hawks and owls and was intended to dispel prevalent popular prejudice against birds of prey.31 Before the turn of the century the survey published a variety of other studies, ranging from Foster E. L. Beal's and Frederic A. Lucas's study of the food of woodpeckers to Syl- vester Judd's work on the role of birds as weed destroyers.32 Although the survey damned the English spar- row, it often vaunted the sparrow's avian cousins as the laborers of nature. The scientific judgments that the survey staff developed depended chiefly upon their analysis of a col- lection of bird stomach contents gathered by survey staff and corre- spondents from throughout North America. By 1899, after fourteen years of survey work, Theodore S. Palmer reported that the survey had amassed a collection "of about thirty-two thousand bird stomachs of which some fourteen thousand [have] been examined."33 Analyzing this stomach data was tedious.34 Researchers organized stomach con- tents into "good," "bad," or "neu- tral" categories of animal remains; plant and mineral material received separate designations. Occasionally the partially digested material was difficult to interpret and researchers routinely sought opinions from gov- ernment entomologists. Once rea- sonably sure of the character of the stomach contents, survey staff com- pared the relative quantities of these components by bulk. The reasoning was that if a bird's diet appeared to contain a major portion of bad insects in relation to, for example, plant material, then it could be clas- sified as a useful species. With few exceptions, this mode of analysis prevailed in survey research into the twentieth century. It provided a clear quantitative measure of the morality of birds in the economy of nature, which economic ornithologists mim- icked in Canada and to some extent in England. Above all, the method allowed the survey to pronounce decisively and authoritatively on the economic status of birds. Popularizing Economic Ornithology A gamut of agencies and individu- als in the U.S. and Canada helped disseminate the "knowledge" that economic ornithology generated, although the survey was acknowl- edged worldwide as the leader in the field. The survey itself carried out propaganda activities by publishing farmers' bulletins and by making contributions to USDA yearbooks. Individual survey members also rou- tinely published articles in popular agricultural and natural history jour- nals and commented in the Auk- the official organ of the AOU-on developments in the field.35 A num- ber of economic ornithologists based in state agriculture departments and experiment stations also contributed to the cause through their own popular Economic Ornithology 175</page><page sequence="5">publications.36 A handful of orni- thologists and avid natural historians in Canada reported survey findings and the findings of other distinguished American economic ornithologists within the pages of Canadian jour- nals.37 Some provincial ministries of agriculture took an interest in diffus- ing the findings of economic orni- thologists. The Ontario Department of Agriculture sponsored the publi- cation of Charles Nash's study, The Birds of Ontario in Relation to Agri- culture; other ministries funded occa- sional speakers on economic orni- thology or reprinted in Sessional papers relevant American articles.38 In general the form of presentation in this genre of propaganda literature differed markedly from the dry analy- ses of stomach data found in the U.S. Biological Survey's official reports. One style of this literature evinced the moral tenor of didactic nature writing by incorporating the received "knowledge" of economic ornitho- logical science into the discourse of bird morality. Thus, although some authors marshalled the statistics and authority of the survey to make a case for or against various bird spe- cies, the mode of delivery bore resem- blance to the most emotive writings of the Sparrow War. Along one tra- jectory, authors praised insectivo- rous birds as honest, moral workers, dutifully and apparently intention- ally fulfilling their natural tasks on behalf of the farmer. For example, C. D. Howe, Vermont's state orni- thologist, praised hardy aves in a short 1915 article entitled "Service of the Birds": The birds are the farmers' and horticul- turists' hired men. They work day and night, seven days in a week, 30 days in a month, 365 days in a year. These hired men do not ask wages, do not ask lodgings, and they board them- selves except occasionally they may take a little cultivated fruit. They may take a chicken now and then when they are driven to it by hunger. These hired men which are working for you every day in the year do not ask for a day off to go fishing or to the ball game; they do not go out on strikes or lockouts, and they do not get drunk on Saturday nights. They are perfectly reliable workmen. And do you horticul- turists and farmers realize it and do you make a definite concerted effort to protect and attract the birds?39 Although Howe was general in his praise of bird service, other authors differentiated among the contribu- tions of different species. Birds of a less pure variety that composed their diet of almost equal portions of insect and plant matter were described by some writers as mixed personalities that deserved sympathy and support. Despite their propensity to consume grain, these species were said to perform good acts on behalf of some farmers. Albert K. Fisher, a member of the survey, attempted in an 1893 bulle- tin to convince farmers of the sea- sonal utility of crows, despite their bad reputation. What farmer needs to be told of the unprincipled conduct of Jim Crow at and immediately after corn-planting time. The ever-present scarecrow bears mute witness to the crow's fondness for corn and his thieving habits. But when the corn is past danger the crow changes from an obnoxious to an exemplary member of bird society, and the war he wages on the cutworm earns him no scanty need of praise from the grass farmer.40 But although some middle-of-the- road species could be tolerated and even encouraged, there existed a group of intolerable and unrepentant rogues. Economic ornithology populariz- ers labeled some species, along with the English sparrow, "good for nothings." In general, imported spe- cies were most denigrated, but some native species, which stepped beyond the supposed bounds of avian moral- ity by squabbling with their kinfolk or gorging on grain, were also held up as examples of birds in need of salvation. George F. Atkinson, who the Manitoba government hired as a naturalist in the early-1900s, in a speech on insectivorous birds warned his audience of the "social degenerate" cowbird, which uncooperatively laid its eggs in the nests of other species. The depravity of a father, while deplorable, is not as generally injurious to the race where the faithful mother is at hand to counteract it, but where that mother becomes so depraved as to desire to shirk the duties of nature the demoralization is complete. In this case the knowledge of right remains...and nothing is more expressive of convic- tion of shame than the sneaking, skulking approach of the female cowbird to the nest....The squalling, greedy nestling which afterwards demands all of the attention of the foster parents to the neglect and frequently starvation of the rightful heirs is a striking example of the blubbering, bullying overgrown "booby," whose mother declares she is unable to control him.... [I am forced] to exclaim "Oh, for a Luther to regenerate the morals of the cowbird."4' Although Atkinson remarked later that the cowbird performed certain important duties in insect control, he was deeply disturbed by the immo- rality of cowbird family life. In the conflation of economic ornithology and the discourse of bird morality, as Atkinson's concerns demonstrate, the economic was not always privileged over the moral; in some cases ideal- ism prevailed over materialism.42 However, another form of dis- course that treated birds not as per- sons writ small but as resources requiring wise management accom- panied this style of moralizing as a vehicle for economic ornithological "knowledge." On one level this approach was intended to appeal to readers' common sense. Ontario natu- ralist William Saunders, for example, eschewed a moralizing tone in his writings on the utility of birds. In a 1938 report of the Ontario Entomo- logical Society discussing the useful- ness of owls for controlling rodent pests, Saunders weighed the benefits owls conferred against their propen- sity for taking farm poultry. After relat- ing the story of an owl found dead with its stomach filled with thirteen field mice, Saunders suggested that: if those mice were valued at two cents each, then that owl was worth twenty- six cents a day to the neighborhood, and that amounts to nearly a hundred dollars a year. If that figure were cut in two, and again in two, it would leave the owl still worth twenty-five dollars a year, and if the bird took four turkeys partly grown and worth, perhaps, 176 Forest &amp; Conservation History 39 (October 1995)</page><page sequence="6">ten dollars for the four, the question arises, would it not be worth while to pay the owl ten dollars for twenty-five dollars of service? The answer seems to be obvious....43 A host of writers, generally of a scientific background, who attempted to convey the importance of birds as an economic resource paralleled Saunders's cost-benefit approach." Although such approaches to popularizing economic ornithology were intended to appeal to readers' intelligence, or at least to their pock- etbooks, they also implicitly tied the issue of bird protection to other con- servationist programs. According to this point of view, birds should be protected not for their aesthetic appeal but because they are natural resources that ought not be wasted. Some discus- sions of this subject explicitly linked birds and other natural resources, as part of conservationist politics in general. Canadian Dominion Ento- mologist C. Gordon Hewitt, for exam- ple, included in his book on The Conservation of Wildlife in Canada a special chapter on birds in relation to agriculture.45 Similarly, the pro- vincial agriculture ministers pub- lished in 1926 a pamphlet under the cover of the Department of the Inte- rior that contained their views on preserving birds as "a national asset" like any other.46 Wildlife protection legislation in the United States and Canada embodied this appeal to birds as natural resources. Survey officials helped draft the Lacey Act of 1900 in the U.S., the first national legislation of its kind, which out- lined as a resource issue the need for bird protection.47 The joint Migra- tory Bird Treaty that the United States and Canada signed in 1916 contained a similar rationale.48 If birds had souls, as the bird moralists claimed, according to the conserva- tionists they also had a dollar value. Dual construction of birds as moral agents and as natural resources demonstrates the shifting and com- peting definitions of wildlife in the discourse that promoted birds as pest control agents. More broadly, birds became one of a number of sites in which dominant strains of conservationist politics could define their object. From this perspective, the vitriolic early-twentieth-century debates over so-called nature-fakery in nature writing-a fight between those who portrayed wildlife as imbued with human personality and those who sought a seemingly more "scientific" approach-can be seen as one episode in a longer dispute. Over the course of the twentieth cen- tury, nature writers and bird enthu- siasts tended to drop the conception of the bird as a natural resource; the moralizing discourse met a similar fate, although it survived in a more subtle form in some quarters. Part of the reason for the decline in the descrip- tion of birds as natural resources was related in general terms to the demise of economic ornithology as a science. When economic ornithologists' claims of authority came to be seriously ques- tioned in the early-twentieth century, utility claims on behalf of birds conse- quently became more tenuous. The Failure of Ehonomki Ornithology Environmental historians have identified several crucial factors to account for the general decline in biological control research and appli- cation in North American agricul- ture from 1930-60. Thomas Dunlap has demonstrated the enthusiasm with which farmers and government entomologists in the United States adopted and promoted pesticides that appeared to deal with insect pests in short order.49 John Perkins has argued that as pesticides came to dominate the pest control literature in the late-1940s and 1950s, scien- tists who investigated biological con- trol were castigated for being "out of date."50 Others, like entomologist Robert van den Bosch, have con- structed pictures of the close relation- ships among agribusiness, chemical firms, and government entomolo- gists in promoting pesticides and institutionalizing the pesticide tread- mill.51 However, although increasing pesticide use-particularly after the Second World War-played an impor- tant role in undermining the necessity of biological control programs, it is questionable whether biological con- trol offered a viable option for farm- ers in the early-twentieth century. Although over the last twenty years it has been demonstrated that in some agricultural systems birds can play an important role in pest con- trol, this proposition was unproven in the early-twentieth century.52 Eco- nomic ornithology was impractical, riven by debate over its fundamental methods, and weakened by the wan- ing status of the U.S. Biological Sur- vey, its major institutional sponsor. An Applied Science? A body of literature developed in economic ornithology between 1880 and 1930 that in its systematic and popularized forms proposed remark- ably little about how one could practi- cally take advantage of the benefits of the laborers of nature. Since the Sparrow War the implicit problem of economic ornithology was to weigh the good or ill effects of birds. Only rarely did field practitioners take the further step of suggesting how this knowledge might be applied. There were publications that advised how to poison and trap the unwanted English sparrow, but there was little advice on how to employ useful birds.53 The most that economic orni- thologists did was to advise people to plant bushes or construct bird- houses in an effort to attract desired species; although there were rare exceptions to this general lack of instruction, they only serve to prove the rule.54 This bias toward the observational and away from the practical in eco- nomic ornithology's direction and scope was related to the particular political context in which the science arose. From the 1880s economic ornithology served as the utilitarian "knowledge" base for bird conserva- tionists. In advocating the usefulness of various birds, economic ornitholo- gists called for their protection; in advocating the protection of birds, conservationists recommended their utility. In this sense economic orni- thology, both in its institutional set- ting and its political contexts, came Economic Ornithology 177</page><page sequence="7">to be more closely related to wildlife management science than to ento- mology. It is unsurprising therefore that Waldo L. McAtee, one of the survey's most important economic ornithologists in the early-twentieth century, was also the first editor of the Wildlife Review and founding editor of the Journal of Wildlife Management.55 When the survey dissolved in 1939, effectively termi- nating economic ornithology within the USDA, its employees shifted to the U.S. Department of the Interior to help form the U.S. Fish and Wild- life Service. Debates over Method What set systematic economic orni- thology apart from natural historical observation in the 1880s and after was the use of bird-diet data in for- mulating judgments about the eco- nomic status of birds. The methods employed to study these data and to give them significance were impor- tant: the science stood upon the foundation of bird stomach analysis. The survey primarily employed the volumetric method, which compared diet components by bulk. Prior to the survey, researchers employed a variety of methods but two general approaches dominated. One was the bulk comparison method that Stephen Forbes used in combination with careful field observation. This was the approach that the survey later used in an abstracted form. Another was the so-called numerical method, which consisted of the careful listing of the number of occurrences of food items found in bird stomach data. Wisconsin agronomist Franklin H. King favored this method, which was also popular in Britain.56 A third and generally unpopular approach called the gravimetric method entailed comparing data by weight. Only German economic ornithologist Georg Rorig consistently used this method.57 Although late-nineteenth-century economic ornithologists in North America used several methods in their practice, after the survey was established the volumetric method became dominant. The work of Foster E. L. Beal, a senior survey economic ornithologist in the late- nineteenth and early-twentieth cen- turies who was both a respected and prolific scientist, provides a case in point. British economic ornithologist Walter Collinge described Beal as "the most brilliant economic orni- thologist of his day."58 By the end of his career, Beal had examined 37,825 bird stomachs and authored over twenty publications for the sur- vey.59 His most popular publication, "Some Common Birds in Their Rela- tion to Agriculture," first published in 1897, was reprinted more than fifty times and had more than a mil- lion of its copies distributed.60 After his death in 1916, Beal's former col- league McAtee claimed that along with Forbes, Beal was cofounder of the scientific approach to economic ornithology. "Professor Forbes dealt with the subject in a broad, philo- sophical way, but soon gave it up," McAtee wrote, "while Professor Beal devoted himself practically for the remainder of his life to piling up detailed evidence, leaving the general principles to become apparent of them- selves."61 Indeed, Beal's prolific life work was notable for its empiricist zeal and not for its theoretical subtlety. Beal's one attempt to present the theoretical underpinnings for his methodology was in his 1908 paper called "The Relations Between Birds and Insects."62 The paper was a con- densed reiteration of Forbes's classic "On Some Interactions of Organisms," published twenty-eight years earlier.63 However, unlike Forbes's theoretical understanding of birds' role in nature, Beal based his argument on the revealed truths of stomach data. At the opening of the paper Beal listed the percentage breakdown of various foodstuffs in the diets of a variety of birds. The data were provided by earlier survey studies and thus con- tained an indiscriminate collation of stomach data from birds throughout North America, collected over all seasons. The seeming statistical pre- cision of this data (which Beal took to two decimal places), rather than the context from which they were drawn, was as crucial for Beal as it was for the survey in general.64 The hard statistics offered by the volu- metric method provided hard advice; the so-called numerical method, which Beal criticized, provided mere lists of diet components.65 Despite the survey's dominance in the field, however, other studies in the first decade of the twentieth cen- tury questioned the foundation of the volumetric method. Sylvester Judd, a survey employee, conducted a pains- taking study over a number of years of economic ornithology on one farm in Maryland to compare the general statistical results of survey research with the evidence of one locality.66 To his chagrin, he found that birds on the farm rarely focused their consumption on problem pests but happily spent their days consum- ing "hordes of harmless insects" on the banks of the Potomac River.67 This result demonstrated that the general character of bird diet pro- vided little guidance as to the effect of birds in different agricultural sys- tems. Yet in spite of the important implications that Judd's study had for the research strategy of the sur- vey, his contribution created no meth- odological reflection within the agency. Another line of criticism arising from outside the survey itself ques- tioned the relevance of the volumetric method. C. W. Mason, a proponent of the numerical method developed by fellow Briton Robert Newstead, claimed in 1912 that "comparative bulks of foods, if expressed merely as percentages, are of absolutely no value whatsoever, and cannot give any idea as to the true economic ratio of the food of the bird in question."68 Unlike Judd's study, Mason's critical aspersions did not go unnoticed. In the same year as Mason's pub- lication, McAtee, who later became Director of the Biological Survey's Foods Habits Division, wrote a stinging review of numerical methods in the Auk and gave Mason's study special condemnation.69 McAtee's critique, however, was not simply aimed at contemporary approaches; he searched the history of economic ornithology to criticize the methods of ghosts and exorcise their perhaps forgotten influence. Thus he held 178 Forest &amp; Conservation History 39 (October 1995)</page><page sequence="8">up King's forgotten methods to this polemical guillotine, along with the methods of E. V. Wilcox (published in 1892), John Gilmour (published in 1896), and Newstead (the only contemporary study, except Mason's, published in 1908).7? Part of his criticism was that those who found fault with the volumetric method had adopted no single numerical method. In his view, the variety of numerical methods suggested a state of intellec- tual hodgepodge.71 He also argued that numerical methods exaggerated the amount of some animal foods in stomach analysis, since more resistant animal parts remained in the stomach longer than others.72 The implication was that numerical results were, even before interpretation, distorted, unlike volumetric methods, which smoothed over such difficulties. Most of McAtee's concern, however, cen- tered on the belief that the numerical method provided no basis for quan- titative comparison and was thus "powerless to convey an impression of economic values."73 In contrast, the volumetric method provided data that was easily presented to the public and which incorporated some form of quantitative analysis, a fact he thought crucial. "Lord Kelvin has said," he wrote, [that] "when you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind..." It follows therefore, that a method of estimating bird food which is powerless to express anything about a considerable portion of the food, has "scarcely advanced to the stage of science."74 With a combination of argument and assertion, and liberal use of quoted authorities, McAtee provoca- tively defended the survey's method- ology as the only method that had "advanced to the stage of science." In the short term, McAtee's review received only admiring responses. In Britain where the numerical method held more sway, Walter E. Collinge wrote a 1918 article that explicitly reiterated McAtee's points and even contained the same Lord Kelvin quo- tation.75 In North America, where the volumetric method was generally applied, there were apparently no criticisms of McAtee's critique. The only citations to the paper were favorable, as in Junius Henderson's discussion of "methods of investiga- tion," published a year after McAtee's study. Referring to the volumetric method that the survey employed, Henderson asserted that "from a decision based upon such evidence [volumetric analysis], providing a sufficient number of stomachs are examined with care, there is no appeal."76 The volumetric method and the survey had their defenders. There were further criticisms of the survey's economic ornithological methods during the 1920s and 1930s. Scottish scientist James Ritchie offered one of the most cogent of these criti- cisms in a series of articles in the 1920s that logically dismantled the volumetric approach on its method- ological and theoretical bases.77 But more important developments during this period occurred in entomologi- cal science. Entomological advances in the analysis of insect population dynamics and in the factors regulat- ing them served to undermine the bold claims that economic ornitholo- gists made on behalf of their sub- jects. In 1928, Canadian entomolo- gist Edgar H. Strickland criticized economic ornithologists for their meager understanding of entomology. The simple knowledge, he claimed, that birds consume many insects did not prove their utility in dampening insect outbreaks.78 C. N. Ainslie of the U.S. Bureau of Entomology later suggested that economic ornitholo- gists overstated the usefulness of birds and ignored more important regulators of insect outbreaks, such as parasitic agents.79 These arguments paralleled debates concerning popu- lation dynamics in mammalogy. Quantitative methods of animal ecology, of which new approaches in entomology were part, challenged the older natural history tradition of collection and qualitative analysis both in ornithology and mammalogy.80 Developments in entomology and animal ecology did not necessarily mean the end of economic ornithology. As early as the 1910s some ento- mologists, such as Harold C. Bryant and George W. Barber, in order to develop a more sophisticated under- standing of economic ornithology, applied new techniques of estimating insect populations and the numerical and behavioral responses of birds in outbreak cases.81 Within the survey, however, which had led economic ornithology since its founding, such a reorientation was not forthcoming. Waldo L. McAtee, who previously defended the volumetric method, in 1926 stated cautiously when refer- ring to the survey's approach that "investigations are for the most part...directed toward learning what birds eat in general, rather than deter- mining the explicit effects of their food habits upon certain insects and other pests."82 The internal debates about economic ornithology, com- bined with external developments in the study of population dynamics, served to dampen the enthusiasm with which economic ornithologists trumpeted the utility of certain birds. A Bureau of Destruction The declining political reputation of the survey in conservationist circles in the 1920s and 1930s, combined with the weakening of the "science" of economic ornithology, helped undermine the survey's legitimacy as a scientific voice for bird protection in the United States. Although since its founding the survey acted as a major sponsor of basic biological research in North America, begin- ning in the early-twentieth century wildlife control became one of the agency's major preoccupations. Although the survey took on several tasks after passage of the Lacey Act in 1900, national wildlife control programs steadily gained in impor- tance.83 Survey historian Jenks Cameron tabulated that by 1928 the survey had spent somewhere around $10,212,353 on predatory animal and rodent control work. This money between 1915 and 1928 helped Economic Ornithology 179</page><page sequence="9">account for the killing of 419,443 predatory animals in the United States, helping lead to a discrediting of economic ornithologists in the eyes of some wildlife conservation- ists.84 The survey was not only negli- gent in monitoring sport hunting at sanctuaries in the 1920s, but the institution itself became known as a bureaucratic shell for animal exter- mination programs.85 The Emergency Conservation Committee chastised the survey in 1934 as the "United States Bureau of Destruction and Extermination" and published a pamphlet condemning the "misnamed and perverted" institution.86 The survey's deeds spoke more strongly than the trickle of survey pamphlets on the utility of birds. Demise of Economic Ornithology Although by the 1930s internal difficulties may have weakened the biological control project that eco- nomic ornithology represented, after the ascendancy of pesticides during and following World War II the idea of the role of birds as agents of bio- logical control fell out of favor. On the scientific side, in entomology the prestige of pesticide research redi- rected the research and development interests of pest control scientists. Research in biological control and basic field research on insects in the field declined; pesticide research filled the journals of applied ento- mology.87 Economic ornithology demonstrated this trend. Over the period that synthetic organic pesti- cides rose to prominence, research on the beneficial effects of birds in agriculture dropped dramatically. At the same time, investigations of birds as pests experienced a notable increase. In Wildlife Abstracts between 1931 and 1951 there were forty-four articles relating to bird diet; twenty were not economic in scope, twenty- two demonstrated the beneficial activities of birds, and two concerned birds as pests. Between 1952 and 1955, by contrast, there was one article on the beneficial activities of birds and fifteen on the subject of birds as pests. In the next four years, there were no articles on the benefi- cial use of birds and thirty-six on bird pest control.88 After the decline of economic ornithology, birds were no longer the laborers of nature in the pest control literature; instead they were either irrelevant or pests. On a material level the possibility of birds as pest-control agents faded with the progress of industrialization in agriculture. This resulted both because the increasing use of pesti- cides held out the unintended conse- quence of harming and sometimes killing birds, and because the trend toward monoculture and increased field sizes, two hallmarks of indus- trialization, reduced bird habitat. The place of birds within such an evolving agroecology became increas- ingly problematic. The irony in the story of economic ornithology is that when conserva- tionists and environmentalists ques- tioned this new state of affairs it was within new conceptual terms of ref- erence that industrialization created. When Rachel Carson published Silent Spring in 1962, revealing to the public the danger of indiscriminate pesticide use, few people probably stopped to wonder how over the course of more than thirty years the image of the "bird" had been com- pletely transformed.89 The new envi- ronmentalism took birds to be muted victims of progress. Spring was silent because no birds sang; gone was a vision of birds as an alternate form of pest control. The biological con- trol efforts of economic ornithology failed not only because of the rise of pesticides. The internal weaknesses of the science and environmentalists' abandonment of the idea of birds as part of agriculture left the concept of avian agent biological control unthinkable until it was resurrected much later.

I developed these figures through a tabu- lation of articles listed in Wildlife Abstracts from 1935 to 1960. The organization of these articles within the abstracts was somewhat uneven over time and catego- ries of article classification shifted. From 1935-51, I examined sections on "Birds-Foods; Economics" and "Birds-Management." These categories changed from 1952-55, and I examined the replacement categories "Birds-Eco- nomics," "Birds-Protection; Rare and Extinct Species," and "Birds-Control Methods." From 1956-60, I examined the categories "Birds-Economics," "Birds-Protection; Extinct and Vanish- ing Species," and "Birds-Control Meth- ods." I did not count non-English language articles; the vast majority of articles are American. 89.
