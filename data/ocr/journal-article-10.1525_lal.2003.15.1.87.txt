Children’s literature is a vitally important source of  law. It is not a question of  “law and literature” but of  literature as law, and law as literature. The article takes the celebrated book by Maurice Sendak, “Where the Wild Things Are,”  as a case study. Using the work of  Elias and Piaget, the article demonstrates how this story explores precisely what it means to begin to learn how to “interpret” a legal text. Sendak’s text dramatizes the inherent diYculties that children face in understanding what it means to be obedient. The child Max resolves this proto-legal dilemma through an idea of  legal responsibility that is incommensurable to that of  legal obedience. Drawing on the ethical philosophy of  Emmanuel Levinas, the article concludes that to love the law, or to promise to honor the law of  the family one loves, demands an on-going commitment to think about its purposes and its justice. PAR T  I .  A  HE AD  W I THOUT  A  WOR LD 2 Children, Literature , and the Law Once upon a time, law was myth. Peter Fitzpatrick begins his study, it is true, by dryly observing that “[m]odernity, for a start, is not supposed to be about myth.”3 But he soon embarks on a demonstration of  the very myth of  the absence of  myth that lies at the heart of  modern law. Thus in H.L.A. Hart, the legal order emanates from the “primal scene”4 of  a king and his subjects, whose slow mythical accretion of  the attributes of  modern sovereignty paral- lels, for Hart, the growing legitimacy of  his commands.

Moses, Cain and Abel, Antigone and Creon,5 Billy Budd and Captain Vere6— time and again, our legal culture retells the story of  how we sacriWced the state of  nature and submitted instead to a legal order marked by objectivity and obe- dience. Indeed, the objectivity of  the law and the obedience of  its subjects seem precisely to be the terms of  this new settlement. The story is always told as a tragedy and as a loss of  innocence, but nonetheless necessary for that. “[A]n angel of  God!” says Captain Vere of  his noble savage, “yet the angel must hang!”7 The reconciliation of  “civilized” law to its subjects and victims would appear to be a very important myth indeed. Freud locates his primal scene in the murder of  Oedipus by his children. In response to their guilt, they resurrect their absent father by constituting for themselves binding norms of  behaviour.8 Derrida asks an awkward question. If  this is meant to be the origin of  law, if  there was no law before the primal parricide, where exactly did the guilt come from? “To have felt remorse the brothers must have already transgressed a prior law, not produced it . . .”9 But of  course that is precisely the point: myth aims to reconcile the contradictory assumptions of  a structure or way of  thinking and, by setting them in some distant past that is before or out of  time, to prevent us from asking too closely how it is that they got there. A myth is protected by the sacred rituals that surround it.10 For Claude Levi-Strauss, myth is the collection of  symbolic resources that mandate and preWgure the structure of  social relations,11 with, in Hans Blu- menberg’s work, a speciWcally theistic content.12 This would accord with the origin of  mythos in Ancient Greek, meaning not just a narrative—from the word for a mouth—but the proper register in which to speak of  the Gods. At the same time this spiritual element has been radically eviscerated in much contemporary thought. Thus Roland Barthes, in his immensely inXuential Mythologies, discovers in contemporary society the continuance of  myth as a feature of  everyday life.13 Yet several aspects of  myth might yet allow us to Wnd common ground amongst these various interpretations. Myth is a collection of narratives that are world-creating and, no less important, world-legitimating and world-harmonizing. One might even say that in creating their own world in time or space (a Valhalla, for example, an Olympus, a Dreamtime, or a Mid- dle Earth) they legitimate and harmonize ours. In that sense, they are essen- tially conservative.14 They speak of  the foundational structures and divisions 88 </page> <page sequence="3"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love in language and society in a manner that presents them precisely as natural or ordained by the gods. Myths therefore elevate and at the same time defuse conXict. Their resolution is foundational and aesthetic.15 Firstly, then, a myth is a psychological cummerbund. It dramatizes and ornaments the cleavage that lies at the origin of  any normative system, the moment of  its foundation, making a virtue of  necessity. All law must have a foundation in non-law, in illegality or violence, which is only capable of  being legitimated after the fact. Hans Kelsen acknowledged this diYculty through the myth of  the Grundnorm, but believed that this was a problem only at the very moment that a legal system was being established. The law that sets in motion the multitude of  laws that follow and refer to it is itself  not referable to a prior law. But for Kelsen, once the system was underway, it was basically self-functioning.16 Nevertheless, every legal judgment, every act of  interpreta- tion, in as much as it is not conclusively referable to some previous text, stat- ute, or case, suVers from the momentary aberration to which Kelsen gave the name Grundnorm: each and every such decision is an exercise of  choice whose legality can only be determined by its conWrmation thereafter. This temporal paradox besets all the interpretative judgments we make, leading Beardsworth to insist that “the aporia of  law is the aporia of  time.”17  This is just one example of  the ways in which the crises in foundation or legitimacy of  social structures are continually being reproduced and experi- enced in miniature. There is a constant and parallel need, therefore, to reaYrm the stories that sanctify the moment of  origin and the structural choices of  a society. In this way, then, myths can be understood as narratives about the gods—that which is eternal and foundational—that are sustained by their constant echoes in the everyday, that which is contingent and responsive. That was Levi-Strauss’ point, it was Pierre Bourdieu’s,18 and it was no less Barthes’: myth provides a rich complex of  semiotic resources that Wnd resonances throughout society, giving colour and force to the myths and the values they represent. At every level from the founding of  the State, to the iconography of sporting heroes, to advertisements for Persil and Porsche, myths are drawn upon and in the process upheld. Secondly, myth constitutes legal subjects in accordance with the values it narrates.19 Myth, to cite a most suggestive phrase, “constellates our grasp of reality.”20 A constellation is a way of  ordering the random. It allows us to Wnd patterns of  meaning and capacities for recognition amongst the spatter of 89 </page> <page sequence="4"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 stars. DiVerent societies will do so diVerently, for the patterns are not “in” the stars but in the stories under the inXuence of  which they are approached and indeed rendered comprehensible. So a constellation uses stories and imagina- tion to make sense out of  random astronomical objects. And myth does the same thing with respect to social facts. It provides us with a frame of  reference that allows us to draw recognizable patterns of  meaning from the jumbled world around us. It is a means of  orientation in the world, and the means by which we come to have an orientation. The result is, for those who navigate their lives in accordance with a particular set of  myths, they become the kind of person that these myths demand of  them. Myths constitute our relationships, to ourselves, to others, and to institutions. They are neither true nor false, but a way of  becoming-true, and of  making us true to their premises and promises. Thirdly, myths work their magic by means of  narratives. The element of narrative is absolutely essential, since it is what gives to myth its transforma- tive power. Stories do not prescribe behaviour: they do not lay down laws for us. Instead, they inscribe behaviour: they lay down ways of  being in us. For every constitution there is an epic, for each Decalogue a scripture. Once understood in the context of  the narratives that give it meaning, law becomes not merely a system of  rules to be observed, but a world in which we live. In this normative world, law and narrative are inseparably related.21 The process of  forming culture through constitutive narratives continues in one way or another throughout our life. National anthems and poems, advertisements in newspapers and on television, sporting events: all partake of the mythological, as Barthes showed us so well.22 Myth, therefore, is not the exclusive province of  childhood but a constant transformative experience throughout our lives. Nevertheless it operates, as we will see when we come to unravel the connotative dimensions of  a speciWc children’s story later in, by drawing on a complex web of  associations, memories, histories, and struc- tures. While this web gets ever more complicated as we grow, the impact of each new strand is correspondingly less. Each new strand sets in train a pattern of  harmonic resonances with the strands already in place, vibrating with the strength of  the whole that supports it. Myths, and the stories and images through which they are told, begin to eVect us subliminally, almost impercep- tibly. They work, in other words, by setting oV echoes and vibrations in our memories. In childhood, on the other hand, the weight that each new strand 90 </page> <page sequence="5"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love must carry in the structures of  understanding that are thus being formed are correspondingly heavy and singular. Consequently, the experience of  myth- making is felt with unusual force and inXuence in childhood. Indeed, the two privileged sites for the discussion of  myth are the savage and the child. We might ask what these two have in common. According to Freud, savage parricide resulted in the emergence of  the Oedipus complex and the transformation of  the relationship between father and son. But for evi- dence of  this proposition he draws on the “ambivalent father-complexes of our children.”23 So too Freud’s assertion as to the replacement of  the absent father by the realm of  the sacred in primitive societies is supported by his anal- ysis of  animal phobias in children.24 Even more explicitly, Freud acknowl- edges the importance of  the “primitives of  our time, our children” in provid- ing a basis for understanding totemism.25 On a similar note, Jürgen Habermas relies on Jean Piaget’s theories of  childhood to sustain the notion that societies go through three stages: the mythical, the religious-metaphysical, and the modern.26  Childhood is a time of  permeable boundaries and of  slowly emerging sub- jectivities, a time in which the web of  myth can be seen weaving its magic most clearly and with greatest eVect. Certainly the scholars of  myth have thought so, and have found themselves attracted to children’s behaviour as a laboratory for their theories. But there is a logic here that has not yet been adequately pur- sued. For if  childhood is a province of  myth, and if  myth itself  is to be under- stood as central to our understanding of  society and law, then the mytho- logical elements of  children’s stories ought themselves to be regarded as an essential site for the emergence of  particular understandings of  law. I want to demonstrate that proposition in this essay by focusing on one such story in particular, with a view to establishing its mythic qualities and at the same time asking exactly what relationship to law and authority is thereby being constituted. Children’s fables are without a doubt pedagogical and normative; we would not set such store by them were it not so.27 And they are profoundly inXuential in the child’s constitution. Stories transport us, and the younger we are the more absolute is our transportation. For children, stories are worlds to inhabit. The authority of  the story derives from its experiential force, coupled with the child’s ability to summon it up again and again and to respond to it as they will. The story has a power over the very young that it may never have again; but part of  the power it has is the power to conjure that it permits 91 </page> <page sequence="6"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 children themselves to exercise. In particular in the lives of  smaller children, books have a sacred quality and are often surrounded by rituals that heighten their emotional signiWcance for the child. At the same time, these books exist as events in the lives of  children who are only gradually capable of  distinguish- ing diVerent kinds of  reality. We are none of  us born with boundaries between Wction and reality, self  and other. This we learn, and books teach us. But para- doxically, a children’s story also undermines those boundaries, or more pre- cisely, uses the early malleability of  those boundaries in order to constitute them, from the inside as it were. In that sense, such stories are of  course rather like a Constitution: an act of  absolute and unlimited sovereignty which com- mits to binding itself  and to placing limits on that sovereignty . . . happily ever after. The authority of  a children’s story, then, in part derives from the way it transgresses the rules in the very process of  introducing us to them. This is part of  the connection between myth, the sacred, and ritual. It is why so many ancient rituals are governed by ecstasy, possession, or hallucination;28 here too, the messages imparted have a peculiarly powerful quality because they reach in below the level of  the conscious mind and its customary barriers to cognition. But children do not need to take mind-altering drugs to alter their minds. Do we not yearn to recapture something of  this excitement in our later years?29 This feeling of  absolute submission to an external force and yet abso- lute freedom over it; this feeling that we look for in “literature,” in “adven- ture,” and even in love. Of  each, we talk about getting lost or falling as some- how the goal. They are subconscious choices we make because we desire this transgression, this loss of  control. They are only instances of  the desire to be transformed, to be transWgured, to lose our sense of  earth-bound mortality by being someone or somewhere else. To be otherwise-than-ourselves is desire.30 Literature and adventure are modes of  apprehending of  the power of  myth to transform us. But we are far from the ancients, and in a world where mythless- ness is our greatest myth, these constitutive and transcendental experiences are surpassingly rare. Children’s books often hold a powerful place in our emotional memory precisely because they harbour between their covers myth in its Wrst and purest form. There is nothing mysterious about myth. It shines in the most mundane of environments: a picture book in a bedroom at night, on a parent’s knee or under the covers, by a study light or the glimmer of  a torch, read silently, out 92 </page> <page sequence="7"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love loud, or oV by heart. These everyday contexts should not distract us from the signiWcance of  its function in the lives of  children. In this regard, childhood is the scene of  the mythic emergence of  sociability in each and every life, repeated and constantly renewed. Children’s literature, then, is not like myth. It is myth. Children’s literature is not a source of  information about social structures of  subjectivity in our society. It is the very site of  their emergence. Children’s literature is not a series of  texts about the law. It is a source of  law. Perhaps this is not yet mainstream jurisprudence, but it is hardly controver- sial either. The school of  legal pluralism has done much in recent years to emphasize that law is fundamentally not a product of  canonical forms and stat- utory enactments. It is learned, and practiced, in speciWc cultural contexts, in diverse and disparate fashions, on an everyday basis. The interpretative bat- tles over the meaning and functions of  law take place not as a spectacle in the courts of  law’s empire, but as daily events in the streets, societies, and homes all around us.31 Because law is synonymous with the symbolic order, it is pro- duced in the dialogue and discourse all about us: in all the things that we read and say, in the music we listen to,32 and the art we grow up with.33 I want to extend that contention in this essay by arguing that there are nevertheless texts that provide an important discourse through which we develop assumptions as to the meaning, function, and interpretation of  law; assumptions that are tested and implemented in those daily events throughout our lives. The texts that play this important role are not the Magna Carta or Marbury v. Madison. They are our children’s books. Any claim as to the privileged status of  children’s literature depends, of course, on a particular social context. Philippe Ariès’ ground-breaking book, Centuries of  Childhood, traces to about the seventeenth century the social pre- occupation with childhood as a distinct category of  life.34 The twin concepts of the individual, unique and vulnerable to death (devant la mort as he wrote elsewhere35), and society, a force capable of  rendering productive that individ- ual across many lifetimes, led to an altogether new signiWcance being aVorded to children—the wellspring of  that individual, the clay of  that society, the promise of  triumph over that mortality. In light of  these speciWc expectations and anxieties, the family began to develop its modern form as an intense struc- ture of  aVect centred on the care of  children,36 and with it developed an intense narrative of  nostalgia and desire for the innocence and promise of  youth. Childhood “is the age of  innocence, to which we must all return, in order to 93 </page> <page sequence="8"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 enjoy the happiness to come . . .,” we are told. It is “the golden age of  human life . . .”37 But at the same time childhood began to be thought of  as a time of  danger both in terms of  children’s vulnerability, and by virtue of  their essential diVerence from the norms of  adulthood. In this too, it is apparent that the child preWgures the inherently ambiguous status of  the “noble savage,” by turns vulnerable and innocent, immoral and dangerous. The parallel is rendered explicit in William Golding’s well-known novel, Lord of  the Flies.38 Just so, the imperative of  compulsory education foreshadows the later rationales of  com- pulsory colonialism. The duty to educate becomes, like the duty to civilize, a moral necessity in order to protect society from the contamination of  children no less than the other way around. Ariès continues, The idea of  childish innocence resulted in two kinds of  attitude and behavior towards childhood: Wrstly, safeguarding it against pollution by life, and particu- larly by the sexuality tolerated if  not approved among adults; and secondly, strengthening it by developing character and reason.39 “The two concepts of  childhood,” as an innocence to be cherished, and yet as a weakness to be corrected and a danger to be suppressed, from then on march lockstep into the modern world. The memory of  childhood past was glazed in nostalgia while at the same time the experience of  childhood present was smothered with a hefty and frequently violent discipline.40 By the logic of  this reverse alchemy, what was loved about childhood nev- ertheless had to be ruthlessly destroyed. Up-bringing traces a teleology of loss. Childhood became a normative experience, a question of  standards and expectations, progress and control, surveillance and measurement.41 Many institutions were marshaled for the task, schools of  course most signiWcantly of  all. But even here there was a movement from the end of  the eighteenth cen- tury away from the methodology of  violence and oppression and towards more subtle strategies. Henceforth it was a question of  awakening in the child an adult sense of  respon- sibility and dignity. The child was not so much opposed to the adult . . . as pre- pared for adult life. This preparation could not be carried out brutally and at one stroke. It called for careful, gradual conditioning.42 “The idea of  awakening the man in the child”43 describes a concept of  social- ization of  the young that is still very much with us. It is in this context that a 94 </page> <page sequence="9"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love distinctly children’s literature developed, and is still largely evaluated. The bed-time story is the contemporary instrument of  this subtle, loving, but relentless socialization by which the child becomes Wt and Wtted out for adult life and law. This is the necessary corollary of  contemporary legal pluralism. Since law exists in the everyday, it must be learned in the everyday, too; its content and its techniques—the two, as I will argue, are mutually imbricated— must be entirely continuous with the pedagogical and discursive practices of the modern world. This is precisely the point that Macdonald makes in Lessons of  Everyday Law.44 I want to push the point in this essay by insisting that chil- dren’s books, because of  their mythic power, because of  their capacity to instill resources that echo throughout our life, are a crucial point of  origin for those life-long practices. It is remarkable how few scholars have taken the opportunity to explore the development of  legal understanding through the medium of  children’s litera- ture. On the one hand, children’s writers have, of  course, known all this in their bones for a very long time, and there is a tradition of  myth-making as explicit social constructivism throughout the history of  children’s literature that extends from the versiWcation of  bible stories, through Charles Kingsley’s Water Babies,45 to T.H. White ’s re-telling of  the Arthurian myths of  English nationhood in The Sword in the Stone.46 On the other hand, there have been, especially in recent years, many signiWcant analyses of  the cultural, sociologi- cal, and most certainly mythic dimensions of  children’s books.47 But in all this, its jurisprudential aspects have been roundly ignored. French legal sociologist Chantal Kourilsky has written compellingly on the socialization of  legal con- cepts by children,48 and I shall have much more to say about the pioneering work on this question by Jean Piaget. But what is surprising is to see how little reference there has been to particular children’s texts as performing jurispru- dential work. The law and literature movement, where one might expect such speciWc and speciWcally pluralist studies, has until recently focused on a famil- iar and somewhat orthodox, though gradually expanding, corpus of  adult texts. There was simply no analysis at all of  literature written with a child audience in mind. The interdisciplinary workshop on law and children’s liter- ature held only last year at the Socio-Legal Research Centre in Brisbane deserves to be hailed, therefore, as marking a signiWcant breakthrough.49 The scholars who gathered there pursued an unusual breadth of  materials. Even here, however, two important caveats are warranted. First, much of  the dis- cussion focused on texts for older readers precisely in the capacity that they 95 </page> <page sequence="10"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 might be of  interest to an adult audience, an audience of  jurisprudes. The question of  the impact of  these texts on their intended audience was not, it seems to me, uppermost. Secondly, the approach throughout was to treat those texts as depicting a legal world and then to analyze the implications of, and within, such a world. The text then becomes a law unto itself. This much is true, I think, even of  the sophisticated work of  William Mac- Neil, whose writing on Harry Potter 50 and BuVy the Vampire Slayer 51 is distin- guished by its attention to detail and its theoretical complexity. Particularly in his recent and as yet unpublished work on Tolkien’s Lord of  the Rings, MacNeil makes the case for his theoretical project with eloquence and clarity, describ- ing it in terms of  “clear[ing] the debt, long overdue, that jurisprudence owes so clearly to literary criticism.”52 In other words, the agenda here involves the use of  legal tropes to enrich literary meaning, and not the other way around. MacNeil appears less interested in the implications of  his analysis for the con- struction of  legal persons and norms in an Earth that is not Middle. The way in which this work has developed over the past several years conWrms my pre- vious remarks. Law-and-literature continues to mean literature as gleaned by “lawyers—especially of  a critical stripe.”53 To describe the law in Harry Pot- ter’s world is not yet to speak of  Harry Potter as law, nor yet to think through the processes by which one becomes the other in the lives of  young readers.54 Every Wctional world, it is true, must have a law no less than a geography or a history or a science, and the more complex the world the more detailed it will be. But the question for me, and the point at which my approach parts com- pany with that of  others in the Weld, is this: how does this pertain to or eVect the law (or the history, or the science) in the world of  those who read it? That would seem to be the task that yet awaits us. I want to introduce such an analysis in this essay, parsing a children’s text in light of  the material conditions that govern its reading and the social condi- tions that structure children’s up-bringing, and in consideration of  the actual ways in which it might be understood by the children who read it. Further- more, I want to think through exactly how such a text might indeed constitute the child’s own understanding of  and relation to law in their everyday lives. It is this relationship of  text to world that marks out children’s books not just as stories but as myths in the strong transformative sense I have advocated. As Robert Cover insists, “the creation of  legal meaning . . . takes place always through an essentially cultural medium.”55 Children’s books are precisely such a cultural medium. What is at stake is the proposition that literature holds 96 </page> <page sequence="11"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love the key to the constitutive myths and narratives that begin to organize our relationships to law.56 What is at stake is a claim that would dissolve the bound- ary between law and literature once and for all. Where The Wild Things Are For these reasons the present study takes as its principal concern perhaps the most inXuential of  all books for young children on the cusp of  literacy and, as we will see, the verge of  legality. Where The Wild Things Are has become a, or even the, classic of  children’s literature.57 Since its Wrst publication in 1963, it has gone through innumerable printings, been translated into dozens of  lan- guages, received all imaginable plaudits, and been subject to varied scholarly analyses.58 In the year 2002 alone, there was a major exhibition of  Maurice Sendak’s work, entitled Where The Wild Things Are,59 a video and DVD just released,60 and a Wlm version slated to begin production. For forty years Sendak’s book has been loved for its textual lyricism, its illustrative wit, and its emotional depth. Yet when it Wrst appeared, Sendak’s book was not univer- sally praised. So violent and hostile a reaction did it provoke that some libraries even banned it. Sendak recalls: When that came out, there were psychologists who said, This is a bad book. Any mother who sends their child to bed without dinner is a terrible mother. They objected to that, they objected to him being so rude to his mother, they objected to her yelling back at him, they objected to the Wild Things being too scary. They objected to everything. When it was Wrst published it was very novel and diVerent. In fact, [Bruno Bettelheim] said that. He did take that back later in life. He did me a lot of  damage at the beginning. Now it’s a classic and cult book and showered with praise. And I know it’s going to be on my tomb- stone, I just know it. And of  course, I won’t care, ’cause I’ll be dead.61 Although the eponymous monsters were said to be too frightening for young children, it was the fear that Sendak stirred up in adults that lay behind their antipathy. Sendak’s story respects children’s behaviour, and represents not only their intelligence but their emotional ambivalence. In so doing, like all good literature, Where The Wild Things Are transformed the Weld.62 On his tomb- stone I would engrave the following: Maurice Sendak took children, and chil- dren’s literature, seriously. 97 </page> <page sequence="12"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 Where The Wild Things Are is a book about the emergence of  law. It is the story of  a little boy named Max who is sent to bed without supper and, like H.L.A. Hart, becomes a King in his dreams. It is also the story of  how Max, through the dream, comes to understand something of  the necessity of  law and our responsibility in relation to it. Finally, it is a story that stages the child’s movement from a state of  disorder to participation in the human com- munity of  law, and therefore (mythologically) helps to constitute a parallel movement in its readership. Yet neither law nor literature sustain themselves as decretals. Their legitimacy stems from their ability to speak with us and through us, not merely at us. This is the message of  the text, about law, and it is convincing precisely because it is expressed with the openness of  literature. By showing compassion to its readership and by acknowledging the listening child’s emotional complexity, Where The Wild Things Are transcends the sta- tus of  a pallid primer. The inXuential best-seller, Why Johnny Can’t Read, had in the 1950s incited the process of  transforming children’s literature from “horrible, stupid, emasculated, pointless, tasteless little readers” into some- thing of  actual experiential relevance to the child.63 Where The Wild Things Are exempliWes that transformation. By becoming literature, inviting the reader to make their own judgments and contributions, it becomes part of  the child’s life, and so succeeds pedagogically. So too its story transcends the sta- tus of  an instructional manual on the importance of  obedience. By introducing responsibility, inviting the reader to make their own judgments and contribu- tion, its ideas, too, become part of  the child’s life, and so succeeds as law. Like all myths, it works through an alliance of  form and content that leads people not merely to be told certain things, but to experience them and work through them in themselves. Where The Wild Things Are might stand as the paradigm for a deWnition of  myth that sums up the argument developed in the Wrst Part of  this essay, and that it will be the burden of  the following Parts to demon- strate. Myth is the fusion of  law and literature. My demonstration that Where the Wild Things Are is both an argument about law, and a way of  constituting a speciWc form of  legal subjectivity in children, will take us step by step through the pages of  Sendak’s little epic. The story begins with a domestic drama of  disobedience, for which Max the mis- chievous child is sent to his room to reXect on the error of  his ways. “Before the Law,” the  rst section of  Part II, explores this primal scene of  law-giving through the lens of  Norbert Elias’ sociology of  childhood. He argues that chil- dren’s process of  up-bringing is precisely a miniature re-enactment of  the 98 </page> <page sequence="13"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love development of  modern civilization in the West. It is explicitly represented as such in Sendak’s book. One orthodox position would have it that a civilized child learns to “obey” their parents. But Sendak’s text dramatizes the inherent diYculties that children face in understanding what it means to be obedient. My argument is that these diYculties are insoluble, endemic, and intensely felt. To understand a civilized relationship to law as children begin to perceive it requires us to develop a more complicated jurisprudential position. “The Civilizing Process,” the second section, takes us further on in Max’s story, into the dreamworld that he imagines and that represents his own internal struggle between his desires for freedom and for the approval of  his parents. In order to understand how these tensions are resolved in the development of  legal con- sciousness, we must supplement Elias’ sociology with Piaget’s psychology. Jean Piaget makes a passionate case for an idea of  justice that emerges in and through children themselves and that is not centred on mere submission to authority. But I will endeavour to demonstrate that Piaget’s answer to the question of  how and why this justice emerges in the child is no more satisfac- tory than that of  Elias. The third and concluding section of  Part II, “The Dawning of  Responsibil- ity,” takes this argument to its conclusion, arguing that Max resolves his proto-legal dilemma, at the end of  the dream sequence that forms the center- piece of  the book, through an idea of  legal responsibility that is distinct from that of  legal obedience. Max becomes civilized, in Elias’ terms, by learning to think about his relationship to others, in Piaget’s terms. Unlike Piaget, how- ever, I want to argue that children’s own experience in their families itself  sus- tains a more complex understanding of  what “obeying the law” entails. In Sendak’s book, the moment at which Max thinks of  his family with love is depicted as the dawn of  responsibility. It is the moment at which he abjures forever the kingdom of  the “wild things” and heads for the comforts of  home. Is Sendak suggesting that Max is promised love in exchange for obedience to his parents’ laws? I do not think so. I will argue that a better reading of  Where the Wild Things Are would ask us to understand love and law as institutions that require us to think about what they are for, in order to interpret what they mean. To love the law, or to promise to honour the law of  the family one loves, demands an on-going commitment to think about its purposes and its justice. To H.L.A. Hart, such a commitment is incommensurable with literalism, legalism, or positivism. 99 </page> <page sequence="14"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 The argument that is developed here, therefore, is a reading of  Sendak’s narrative through the lens of  certain normative commitments. Indeed, it is precisely my argument that all interpretations of  texts, including legal texts, must be so normatively engaged. My own reading of  Sendak is not obedient to the text, but responsive to its purposes, just as the concept of  law that the text suggests involves the child who reads it in a growing responsibility to the laws and the principles surrounding them, rather than a mere formal obedience to them. Sendak’s text is a myth that constitutes in children a certain relationship to law. It dramatizes, on my reading, a debate about what it means to interpret the law properly. In Part III the argument moves, like Max’s story, from the inte- rior dialogue of  the subconscious mind back to the real world. Max’s adven- ture ends when he returns home, newly civilized, to his supper. In “Learning Sendak ‘oV by heart’” the essay likewise thinks about the actual conditions under which Where the Wild Things Are might be experienced and read by children. Who reads this story, how, and in what kind of  environment? How do these questions relate to our understanding of  what the story itself  seems to be saying? I argue that the meaning of  such a story will depend in many diVer- ent ways upon the social conditions in which it is read: meaning emerges not from some objective content, whether we are talking about a children’s story or a legal statute, but rather from the discourse that governs how that text is received and interpreted. Nevertheless, I argue that the governance of  chil- dren, at least in some families and in some times, will indeed sustain the com- plex normative reading of  legal obligation that I have defended. The web of the world resonates to the tune of  Sendak’s myth. In the essay’s Conclusion, I draw upon the ethical theory of  Emmanuel Levinas to further explain my particular reading of  Sendak and of  law. Levinas gives us the resources to make sense of  the controlling metaphor of  Where the Wild Things Are: food. Hunger, after all, drove Max to mischief  in the Wrst place; food was the medium of  the sanction meted out to Max for his disobedi- ence, and it is the reward that he receives, on the last page, for his newly civi- lized behaviour. For Levinas, the distinction between hunger and love is funda- mentally the distinction between egotism and altruism. Max’s hunger initially drives him to selWshness. But by the end of  the story food comes to symbolize the love that binds him to his family. Now, at last, he seems capable of  thinking about his behaviour in relation to others, and therefore of  interpreting his par- ents’ laws purposively, which is to say, responsibly. Love and responsibility 100 </page> <page sequence="15"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love emerge in our lives together; we cannot be good legal citizens without them. Sendak appears to be saying no less. PAR T  I I .  T HE  WOR LD  I N  T HE  H EAD Before the Law That night Max wore his wolf  suit and made mischief  of  one kind and another his mother called him “WILD THING!” and Max said “I’LL EAT YOU UP!” so he was sent to bed without eating anything. That very night in Max’s room a forest grew and grew— and grew until his ceiling hung with vines and the walls became the world  all around and an ocean tumbled by with a private boat for Max &amp; he sailed oV  through night &amp; day and in and out of  weeks and almost over a year to Where The Wild things are.64 Where The Wild Things Are dramatizes both (a theory of ) childhood and (a theory of ) law, and uniWes them in narrative form. It treats them both as ele- ments of  what the great German sociologist Norbert Elias termed The Civiliz- ing Process.65 Elias argues that civilization is the “self-consciousness of  the West.”66 It stands, as Mirabeau observed in 1760, equipoised between barbar- ism and decadence.67 But Elias focuses on civilization not as a natural gift, nor as the inevitable progression or the eternal condition of  a culture, but as a speciWc mode of  aVect developed over many centuries. This aVect might be characterized by the growth, from the end of  the medieval period onwards, of a sense of  individualism and privacy, leading to increasing physical and emo- tional restraint across all aspects of  social life. Elias goes straight to the daily experience of  people ’s lives. How do people eat together? Do they sleep in the same room? Do they use cutlery or handkerchiefs or must their hands suYce? What is the intensity of  their public emotional state? Elias argued that so- called “civilized” behaviour is the result of  the physical, emotional, and psy- chological distancing eVects in which we are raised. People who ate together in the way customary in the Middle Ages . . . such people stood in a diVerent relationship to one another than we do. And this 101 </page> <page sequence="16"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 involves not only the level of  clear rational consciousness; their emotional life also had a diVerent structure and character. Their aVects were conditioned to forms of  relationship and conduct which, by today’s standard of  conditioning, are embarrassing or at least unattractive.68  The civilizing process, which begins merely as a kind of  imitation, deepens over time. It operates psychologically through the transformation of  restraint into self-constraint, “partly [in] the form of  conscious self-control and partly that of  automatic habit.”69 The outward and bodily openness in relation to others that marked the medieval world became, over the course of  centuries, transmuted into an internal discipline. Fear was likewise displaced inwards, and became anxiety—the psychological illness of  the civilized. Elias’ contribution to the theorization of  childhood is two-fold. In the Wrst place, he recognizes how important the children’s primer or textbook of  man- ners is in our attempts to understand the aVective world of  the past and the development of  modern and obsessively reWned notions of  bodily propriety. Erasmus’ De civilitate morum puerilium (On civility in children) (1530),70 which Elias studies with great care, is a transcendent moment, since Erasmus thereby “gave new sharpness and impetus to the long-established and commonplace word civilitas” that became thereafter “Wxed into the consciousness of  people with the special sense it received from his treatise.”71 Coloured though it is by his gentle irony, Erasmus’ little work is particularly illuminating both because he took the importance of  etiquette in the formation of  character seriously, and because his precepts show us at once the corporeal elements at the heart of the civilizing process, and yet how far we have traversed from his time to ours: It is disgusting to spit out chewed food and put in on your plate. If  you happen to have eaten something that cannot be swallowed, you should discreetly turn away and toss it somewhere.72 Secondly, Elias insisted that it is through the social and habitual education of children that the civilizing process of  the centuries is performatively re- enacted, in miniature, in the course of  each and every life. The child must learn very quickly to accept the patterns of  control and self-discipline that took our societies many centuries to adopt. They must learn, in a few short years, the privatization of  impulse and the shame of  the body. Yet this socialization is imperative to the structure of  modern law, which depends at every turn upon 102 </page> <page sequence="17"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love a basic fabric of  autonomy, self-restraint, and distance. It makes possible the intercourse of  daily life, and the very freedom that might otherwise undo it. Elias notes, with considerable prescience, how we take for granted the predict- ability and stability of  social relations that this aVective restraint aVords us, and the complex webs of  interaction it thereby permits us to weave in safety. Only place us in a context of  renewed and unpredictable external fear, and see how quickly we succumb to extreme and irrational responses.73 Civilization, in the sense that Elias uses it, must be constantly re-instilled if  it is to maintain the habitus on which our legal and social structures unfailingly depend. Furthermore, as each generation increasingly re-organizes its social struc- tures on the assumption of  just the kind of  aVective restraint that permits greater personal security and social inter-dependence, society demands at each turn a gradual intensiWcation of  this discipline. There is a process of  amp- liWcation at work. Indeed, only by the extended discipline of  children can such discipline be learned.74 No doubt it seems that, on the contrary, children have much more freedom than they used to, say one hundred years ago. Yet, as Ariès noted, that is a change in the theories by which we believe discipline and education can best be instilled. At the same time, it can hardly be doubted that the length of  childhood has steadily expanded over the centuries. Now it would hardly be an overstatement to say that children do not properly grow up and leave the nest until they are twenty-Wve. Or thirty. Or forty. Ariès’ theory then is surprisingly Lamarckian, which is to say not genetic but “socio- genetic”: as we stretch like giraVes towards the farthest leaves, we transmit our attenuated necks—so much more agile, so much more fragile—to our oVspring, through a process of  socialization reproduced in slightly more extended form at each succeeding iteration. Max lies at the farthest end of some twenty-Wve generations of  socio-genetic evolution. No wonder he Wnds civilization, at Wrst, a little hard to stomach. Children’s stories then are agents in the transmission of  discipline to chil- dren, not merely by their immediate instructive power but through their deployment of  myth and their capacity not only to narrate the stories of  a civ- ilization but to echo and to contribute to the echoes of  these myths as they suVuse the child’s world. Sendak’s story provides a particularly striking exam- ple of  the operation of  subliminal inXuences that is inherent in myth’s process of  resonance imaging. Indeed, not only are Sendak’s readers unaware of  the mythic and historical dimensions which the story evokes and with which it resonates across many centuries, but it is entirely probable that the author is 103 </page> <page sequence="18"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 too. Yet the associations are too clear to be ignored or dismissed. I am drawn to an unusual conclusion—we do not set out to tell myths; myths tell us. Max begins the story, like all children, as “a wild thing.” The tropes of  his wildness are not hard to Wnd. “That night,” we are Wrst told, “Max wore his wolf  suit” (4). The head of  the suit looks particularly lupine, with its large whiskers and its great pointy ears that conceal all Max’s hair and cheeks (5). Now the image of  the wolf  has for a long time been synonymous with ideas of alienation from human society, and abundant with connotations of  uncontrol- lable animal fury. In De civilitate morum puerilium, Erasmus himself  cautions his young charge not to set upon dinner with ravening greed. “That is the behaviour of  wolves . . .”75 Emmanuel Levinas, drawing on the language of Thomas Hobbes, asks us to consider whether “man is a wolf  for man.”76 To wear the suit of  the wolf  is to reject all the accoutrements of  law and society and return instead to a solitary life of  predation. The “lone wolf ” has long been a symbol not just for an outsider to the social order, but precisely for an outlaw. An outlaw is a grave threat to com- munity. He is not a barbarian, the enemy at the gates but, far more perilously, the enemy within. And the Latin term was caput lupinum: wolf ’s head,77 in Anglo-Saxon or Germanic sources, wulfesheud or wargus and sometimes were- wolf. All are liminal Wgures, neither man nor beast but as Agamben writes, “[he] who dwells paradoxically within both while belonging to neither.”78 Wild, and a thing. But the wolf ’s head was not simply a legend. It was a legal term with precise legal consequences as far back as (and before) the laws of Edward the Confessor which demand that the outlaw “ bears the wolf ’s head from the day of  his expulsion.”79 So too Bracton80 writes in the most famous text of  thirteenth century jurisprudence, De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliœ: An outlaw also forfeits everything connected with the peace, for from the time he is outlawed he bears the wolf ’s head, so that he may be slain by anyone with impunity, especially if  he resists or takes to Xight so that his arrest is diYcult.81 This is not to say of  course that children reading this story are expected to know their Bracton, nor even that Sendak did. That only makes such a dem- onstration of  the way in which cultural connections and myths are sustained and reinforced, unconsciously and over great stretches of  time, all the more persuasive. Clearly the Wild Things simultaneously draws on memories of these associations, and founds them in its readers’ mind. So the web of  meaning 104 </page> <page sequence="19"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love has been thickened by yet one more strand. Many children may someday read their Bracton with Sendak in mind. On the next page, Max is depicted, caput lupinum, terrorizing the family dog with a fork (7). What is a dog, after all, but a wolf  that has been civilized—an inlaw not an outlaw? As for the fork, its role as a harbinger of  civilization can scarcely be overstated.82 Elias notes that the fork enters the West only in the late Middle Ages. Its arrival served the needs of  neither practice nor hygiene.83 Its Wrst recorded use was by a Byzantine Princess who, arriving in Venice at the close of  the tenth century, appears to have been adjudged shockingly decadent on account of  it.84 James Giblin quotes a contemporary source: Instead of  eating with her Wngers like other people, the princess cuts up her food into small pieces and eats them by means of  little golden forks with two prongs . . . God in his wisdom has provided man with natural forks—his Wngers. Therefore it is an insult to Him to substitute artiWcial metallic forks for them when eating.85 Margaret Visser argues that the development of  conventions of  eating, or etiquette, and in particular the use of  cutlery, served to enhance bodily secu- rity, since nobles could then leave their knives outside dining halls—blunter and more specialized implements were provided for dinner guests inside.86 Yet as Elias insists, the function of  the fork is primarily aesthetic. It expresses and in time produces a distaste for the bodily production of  food; it distances us from it, and from all those who share it with us. The history of  European culi- nary practice may be described as the alienation of  alimentation. We do not eat from a common bowl with our Wngers any more. We are served on personal platters, and the food travels from plate to mouth by means of  dedicated instruments.87 Touching food directly seems not so much wrong as disgusting, and it is one of  the earliest and most fundamental steps in the civilizing of young children to ensure that they feel that disgust themselves. To use a fork once seemed decadent; to use one ’s Wngers now seems barbaric. That is the civilizing process in miniature. Max shows himself, however, radically insensible to the proper use of  cutlery. Instead he brandishes the fork as if  it were the very weapon it was intended to abolish, and thereby reminding us once again that in his socio-genesis, he remains very much a denizen of  the early middle ages. Finally, on the third page, and as the apogee of  this lawlessness, Max threat- ens to eat his mother (8). This allows Sendak’s story to resonate most clearly 105 </page> <page sequence="20"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 with the stories about the savages of  the Cannibal Islands whereto Max later travels. The Western myth of  cannibalism expresses our profound horror at behaviour that seems at once the ultimate breakdown of  legal norms, and the ultimate in bad, bad manners.88 It is this scandalous transgression that leads to Max’s banishment and sets in train the psychological logic of  his awakening. Outlaw, barbarian, cannibal. Max has most assuredly broken the law—a law, one might add, that has the backing of  no less an authority than the Code Civil, which in Quebec, for example, now provides by Article 597 that “every child, regardless of  age, owes respect to this father and mother.” But the meaning and enforcement or even the enforceability of  such a provision is a vexed question.89 Parents, naturally, have their own and distinct sanctions to apply. Max is “sent to bed without eating anything” (8). Bracton notes like- wise it was illegal to feed an outlaw after his expulsion.90 This is serious pun- ishment indeed for a little boy who has communicated, with his every word and gesture, nothing but a need to be fed. Perhaps one might be led to believe from this that civilization is commensurate with learning obedience. Do what you’re told—or starve. The story of  Where The Wild Things Are has been crit- icized, in the inXuential work on “picture books” by Ellen Spitz, for example, for its ethical shallowness in this respect.91 But on the contrary, Sendak pro- vides us with intimations that invite a far more ambiguous and complex read- ing of  the questions of  legality and ethics. No doubt, textual meaning is a func- tion of  social context. As we shall see: we get the Max we deserve. One might read Sendak as a parable on the necessity for obedience to authority. But this essay will insist that a careful reading of  Sendak’s work soon problematizes the simplicity of  its apparent legal formulations. The text is alive with the tension between authority and desire, and if  we are to nd a resolution within it, a way of  satisfying both, it cannot be solely on the basis that we should do what our betters tell us or, to put it another way, that we should only follow orders. There is a more ethically compelling reading available that starts from and is contin- ually aware of  the ambiguity of  Max’s position as he sits alone in his room.  A punishment for being barbarian? Where is the justice in that? Max is sympathetically depicted as experiencing the paradox that sits at the origin of  any legal system; a paradox that marks, moreover, the very entry of the child into law and the symbolic order. The child’s Wrst encounter with law leaves him or her feeling, ironically, the subject of  an injustice. Children are “before the law” in precisely the dual sense that Derrida draws out of  Kafka’s parable.92 That is, they are both ignorant of  the legal order and yet subject to 106 </page> <page sequence="21"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love it. A child is a pre-legal subject and yet the quintessential object of  regulation. Their lives are an experience of  rules that are learned only through the process of  breaking them. Derrida’s point, and he makes it again in “Force of  Law” and elsewhere, is that this structure is inherent in the iterability of  language itself.93 Since interpretation is always a judgment on and after an act, and can- not be entirely pre-determined, there is a sense in which the proper meaning of  law is incapable of  being understood in advance. Meaning is like the rear- view mirror, judged only retrospectively and from a moment that has past. In this sense, “the passage of  time and the violence of  law form two sides of  the same coin.”94 The force of  law, then, contaminates every moment of  its expression. While Hans Kelsen, therefore, would insist that only the Grund- norm—the Wrst law of  a community that establishes the conditions under which it takes place—suVers from this deWciency, Derrida argues that every norm contains within it a tiny fractal Grundnorm of  its own, some decision or judgment that remains unmandated by the past. One might take the analysis back, as Derrida does, to the Bible.95 God man- dated that Adam and Eve should not eat of  the fruit of  the tree of  knowledge. But the two “make mischief  of  one kind and another” and are duly punished for it. Like Max, they must learn the penalty for disobedience. Yet how ought they to have known what disobedience was, let alone its consequences?96 This question it seems to me lies at the heart of  the very idea of  obedience. It derives, to be sure, from the Latin audire meaning to listen, but it implies something rather more than mere comprehension. To obey requires a kind of action in response to or ob-, which is to say, “on account of,” our having lis- tened. So to obey is to submit to the decision of  another, and to comply with their instructions, regardless of  our own judgment. One cannot obey without our obedience manifesting in a mandated course of  action (or in this case, of inaction), and on the other hand one cannot disobey without an intention to act otherwise. Disobedience is an act of  deWance against authority, just as obe- dience is an act of  conscious submission to it. But Adam and Eve live in a world before such a distinction has been formed. How were they to know the wrongful character of  disobedience, which is to say its implications for the authority against which it is set, when they had not yet experienced it—and moreover when the very means by which they could have learnt to distinguish good from evil was prohibited them? It was only by eating the fruit of  the tree of  knowledge that they became aware of  the distinction between obedience and 107 </page> <page sequence="22"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 disobedience. In which case, there is no sense in which they could appreciate the meaning or implications of  their actions prior to their capacity to reXect on them. They were, in the fullest possible sense of  the word, innocent. The pun- ishment of  God was a lesson in the meaning of  disobedience, but it must itself have been unjust. This is true, too, of  children like Max, who discover that they have “gone too far” only by experiencing the punishment for having done so. Indeed, it is precisely the purpose of  children’s play to learn the boundaries of  propriety through a process of  trial and error. Children are common lawyers: they present a constant series of  cases and ask for judgment upon them. And they are experimental sociologists whose parents are the rats in their mazes. They play, and in playing they learn the law. This experimentation, this tasting of  apples, is the means by which the knowledge of  good and evil is learned. But in what sense can we characterize their behaviour as wrongful when it depends on the distinction between play and mischief  that cannot be determined in advance? One might say that Max is being punished for his ignorance of  a law impossi- ble to determine. One might go further and suggest that he is being punished for his very eVorts to discover the law. This might be characterized as the problem of  “original innocence,” hith- erto known as “original sin” precisely in order to beg the question of  the injus- tice that authority thus metes out. Those who would circumscribe our respon- sibility to law in terms of  pure obedience to an already-established order, attempt to cauterize in two ways this injustice. Let us take as our examplar the poster-boy of  modern jurisprudence and the whipping-boy of  postmodern jurisprudence, Herbert Lionel Adolphus Hart. First, although H.L.A. Hart concedes that the “rule of  recognition”97 by which we discover what the law requires of  us is itself  an exercise in violence or politics, he argues that this is merely of  concern at some preliminary or pre-legal moment. Yet as we have seen, it contaminates not only the Wrst law but all laws, since all laws contain within them moments of  newness whose extent can be discovered only in the breach. Secondly while conceding that some laws cannot be properly deter- mined in some circumstances, he insists that this problem is only “penumbral” to the experience of  language. On the contrary, law is mainly preoccupied with “a hard core of  settled meaning”98 that enables all of  us, once we become familiar with the words of  the rule of  law, to modify our actions accordingly. In other words, obedience to law, which is to say acting under instructions without judgment, is largely unproblematic. 108 </page> <page sequence="23"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love By contrast, to soften the distinction . . . is to suggest that all legal questions are fundamentally like those of  the penumbra. It is to assert that there is no central element of  actual law to be seen in the core of  central meaning which rules have, that there is nothing in the nature of  a legal rule inconsistent with all questions being open to reconsideration . . .99 The notion of  obedience and the theory of  hard-core meaning are necessarily connected. Obedience requires the following of  rules without any reconsider- ation of  them and therefore requires them to have some objective content that can be determined by the law-giver, alone and in advance. And Hart ’s lesson for a child like Max would be this: we expect you to learn the law, and to do so you need only obey the words we tell you. On such an analysis, legal civility would be a function of  one’s obedience to the pre-determined meaning of articulated norms. But a hart is no match for a wolf. In evaluating such a theory of  legality, one could do much worse than to look at it from the perspective of  a child. There are few so literal as a child. They appear therefore well placed to test Hart ’s contention that words have an unambiguous “core of  central meaning.” Max is being punished because he has been judged by his parents to have exempli- Wed a “core instance” of  the prohibited behaviour known as “mischief.” Clearly the more unambiguously mischievous his actions, the more disobedient he has been. Hart again, mutatis mutandis: If  we are to communicate with each other at all and if, as in the most elementary form of  law, we are to express our intentions that a certain type of  behavior be regulated by rules, then the general words we use—like [“mischief ”] in the case I consider—must have some standard instance in which no doubts are felt about its application.100 Two elements present themselves as candidates for this unambiguous core of meaning. The Wrst element is his mother’s proclamation that he is a “wild thing!”101 What was it that justiWed this declaratory judgment? Was it the wolf suit? The fork? For Max, all of  these components were simply part of  the fan- tasy world that he had created. Whilst Max was allowed to play, however, it seemed that there were implicit limitations placed on the types of  games he could play. Yet Max, as a child who is before the law in his understanding of the operation of  language and context, is unable to properly decipher the guidelines. Lon Fuller, quoting Ludwig Wittgenstein, oVers a similar scenario: 109 </page> <page sequence="24"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 Someone says to me: “Show the children a game.” I teach them gaming with dice and the other says, “I did not mean that sort of  game.” Must the exclusion of  the game with dice have come before his mind when he gave me that order?102 The limitations that words embody are penetrable only in light of  a context of common purposes and objectives. So much is a familiar argument that Lon Fuller developed, and that critical legal studies later elaborated, precisely in response to Hart.103 As Derrida notes in “Force of  Law,” “the violence of  an injustice has begun when all the members of  a community do not share the same idiom throughout.”104 The study of  children demonstrates just how diY- cult, how cultural, and how important is the ascription of  purposes to words as an integral part of  learning to make sense of  them. It places this problem of interpreting idioms not in terms of  some cross-cultural diYculty or some sociological diVerence, but at the heart of  how every single one of  us actually learns about law and rules. It is the gradual emergence of  children’s under- standing of  their context, not those words, which marks their emergence from a state of  primitivism. So this is what children Wrst learn about law: that it is something that cannot be properly applied without reference to a purposive context of  which they are only gradually aware. Children’s mischief  is precisely evidence of  the importance of, and their ignorance of, a normative context, an understanding of  what the laws are for. Moreover, their playful lit- eralness, in which their mischief  so often consists, demonstrates with consid- erable clarity the impossibility of  arguing otherwise. Children very often act mischievously—either intentionally or otherwise—precisely when they take a rule literally and fail to consider its purpose in a wider context. H.L.A. Hart’s theory that language has a literal and certain “core” of  meaning is the experience of  none of  us: not as children, not as parents. The second element that might serve as the unambiguous core of  meaning of  the word “mischief ” appears to be his threat to “eat you up” (8). Is this not a standard instance of  wrongfulness? Yet even here, or perhaps especially here, the complexity of  the process by which contexts determine meanings becomes apparent. Sendak himself  recalls the origin of  the phrase in his own life. I remembered how I detested my Brooklyn relatives as a small child . . . I remember how inept they were at making small talk with children. There you’d be, sitting on a kitchen chair, totally helpless, while they cooed over you and pinched your cheeks. Or they’d lean way over with their bad teeth and hairy noses 110 </page> <page sequence="25"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love and say something threatening like, “You’re so cute I could eat you up”. And I knew that if  my mother didn’t hurry up with the cooking, they probably would. So on one level, at least, you could say that wild things are Jewish relatives.105 Sendak’s account illuminates just how diYcult and contextual is the process by which even simple structures of  prescription are developed and stabilized. There is no such thing as a standard instance of  the phrase “I could eat you up.” It is apparently a metonym of  aVection in one context, and of  wickedness in another. Indeed, later on in the story, the monsters that Max visits in his dream proclaim, “Oh please don’t go—we’ll eat you up—we love you so!” (34), leaving alarmingly unclear whether they mean to speak metaphorically or literally. In those primitive societies in which some version of  “cannibal- ism” may have been practiced, it was typically both: a symbolic expression of love through the physical incorporation of  parts of  the dead into the bodies of  the living.106 The child’s legal challenge then is precisely to determine the meaning of norms and prescriptions, and the interpretations to be given to his own state- ments, in a world utterly bereft of  any context that would stabilize them. One begins to see that there is a certain traumatic irresolution in the child’s earliest encounters with the law. Obey. But obey what and how? How is Sendak to know that his relatives did not really intend to eat him up? How is Max to know that mischief-making does not belong to the repertoire of  accepted play? And why will no one tell him these things before—rather than by the very act of— sending him to bed? Max’s bewilderment before the law, in the twin sense of his subjection and his ignorance, is hardly surprising. These are diYculties the man from the country has not expected; the Law, he thinks, should surely be accessible at all times and to everyone . . .107 The regulatory framework in which the child lives, at home, requires not an isomorphic mapping of  words onto objects—since that cannot by itself adequately create meaning in the child’s world—but rather a subtly complex reXexive equilibrium that children develop only gradually and through suVer- ing. The child’s challenge is not simply to accept and obey the commands of  a sovereign, but to understand the variable contexts and purposes that give meaning and value to them. This, not Hart’s fantasy of  primitive cultures, is the concept of  law that children learn at Wrst hand. In the Wrst part of  the story, 111 </page> <page sequence="26"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 Max experiences his relationship to law as a crisis. The question I now pursue is exactly what he learns about law and his relationship to it that allows him to resolve this crisis; allows him, in other words, to become civilized. The Civilizing Process And when he came to the place Where The Wild things are they roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws till Max said “BE STILL!” and tamed them with the magic trick of  staring into all their yellow eyes without blinking once and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing of  all and made him king of  all wild things. “And now,” cried Max, “let the wild rumpus start!” “Now stop!” Max said and sent the wild things oV to bed without their supper.108 Max re-enacts through the language of  a dream (10–15), Freud’s “royal road” to the unconscious, “the civilizing process,” our “awakening” to a sense of  propriety that is also a sense of  obligation to law. The “wild things” them- selves are encountered only after Max’s unconscious has traveled for almost a year over an ocean, to a land of  forests, vines, and palm trees (15, 19). Sendak again plays with the inherent instability of  language in the experience of  a child, taking Max’s mother’s standard instance—“his mother called him ‘WILD THING!’” (8)—literally. Like something out of  Ovid’s Metamorpho- ses, the “wild things” have been transformed from metaphors into beings.109 It might even be said that this anthropomorphism or literalization is a classic strategy of  myth-telling. But what sort of  beings are they? Monsters. Radically other, beings that monstrare or show themselves, in deed and not in thought or language. Both in scenery and in characters it appears that we have returned to Jean-Jacques Rousseau,110 and to the imperialist myths of  the South PaciWc he spawned. Max Wnds himself  in a land of  noble savages and cannibal kings. Fiji, it is perhaps worth recalling, was once known as The Cannibal Islands (182 21).111 One might even say that Sendak’s images of  the wild things, equal parts monstrous and loveable, amounts to a delicate balance between the savage and the noble. Nothing could be clearer: a child is a savage and a savage is a child. Erasmus would certainly not have approved. His analysis of  civility begins 112 </page> <page sequence="27"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love with the body and moreover with the eyes, “calm, respectful, and steady . . . not darting and rolling, a feature of  insanity . . . nor staring like those of  idi- ots.”112 Max’s “magic trick” of  staring without blinking betokens a lack of civility that marks him as the king of  the wild things (22–23). At this point, Max’s subconscious permits him to take on the role of  author- ity denied to him in the waking world. He is depicted with all the trappings of law-making (24). It is an authority that rapidly reproduces the law of  the mother. He Wrst permits and indeed participates in a wild rumpus that endures the whole night long (26–31) and it resembles nothing so much as the kind of pagan (or savage) religious bacchanalia common to many societies. As I have already noted, such festivals are prime sites for the transmission through ecstasy or hallucination of  myth, and the constitution thereby of  community. Yet Max’s ambiguous relationship to this community is already a symptom of his modernity and will ultimately lead to his decisive rejection of  the wild things. Just like his mother, he sends them oV to bed (very late) without their supper (32). In Elias’ terms, this transition represents the history of  the civilizing process: from rumpus to sleep. And of  course it is not just a story. Max’s dream repre- sents a child’s growing up in terms that are embedded in the myths of  the his- tory of  the West; its multiple layers echo, resonate, and parallel the emergence of  civilization from savagery and the emergence of  modernity from feudalism. For the dance that Sendak depicts is gloriously intense in its aVective charge. The wild things, like medieval knights in some chanson de geste, go from hostil- ity to love, and from violence to dancing, with bewildering speed. Much of  what appears contradictory to us [about the medieval world]—the intensity of  their piety, the violence of  their fear of  hell, their guilt feelings, their penitence, the immense outbursts of  joy and gaiety, the sudden Xaring and the uncontrollable force of  their hatred and belligerence—all these, like the rapid changes of  mood, are in reality symptoms of  one and the same structuring of  the emotional life. The drives, the emotions were vented more freely, more directly, more openly than later.113 It is worth noting that this intensity of  mood was the condition of  feudal struc- tures of  legal obligation, built as they were around the radical legitimacy of violent aggression and punishment on the one hand, yet stabilized on the other by cascading and interwoven structures of  personal tribute and loyalty. Notions of  fealty and revenge were the pillars of  feudal law. They created 113 </page> <page sequence="28"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 personal and emotional obligations—not generalized normative ones— through and between every level of  government.114 Such a legal order requires a way of  binding subjects to it through aVect. It is to be sustained not by legal science but by legal romance.115 Peter Goodrich has perhaps been almost alone in taking this argument seriously.116 The chansons de geste, therefore, were the major jurisprudential texts of  the period. Friendship was gloriWed, as never before and indeed as never since, because it was a public virtue and indeed a public necessity. Max, for his part, calls to mind nothing so much as King Arthur in his pomp. With jaunty crown and scepter high he is surrounded by courtiers—wild things—who have avid eyes for him, eyes delicately cali- brated between loyalty and ambition (30–31). “Now stop!” Max says (32) and reproduces his mother’s law, the law of restraint and interdiction. This reproduction of  discipline comes with a psy- chic loss, but a necessary one, if  the child is to participate in the modern world. He Wnds that he cannot join the ecstatic community of  the wild things, that he is with them but does not belong with them. In us, the intensity of  emotional exchange, the meaning of  friendship and the value of  passion, has been priva- tized, “everything is more subdued, moderate and calculated, and . . . social taboos are built much more deeply into the fabric of  our drive-economy as self-restraints.”117 We have locked up our rumpuses in rooms,118 and set apart our wildness and our wilderness.119 Max’s recognition of  the need for order is nothing but the disciplining of  the wild things of  his own subconscious, and therefore precisely the internalization of  self-restraint that Elias insists is “the civilizing process.” Whilst Max’s obedience remains contingent only on the threat of  punishment, he remains a barbarian. The internalization of  the necessity for restraint indicates his socio-genesis: Where The Wild Things Are reproduces in the space of  a page many centuries of  historical development, and that which would no doubt take “almost over a year” in the life of  a child. Yet the capriciousness of  this volte-face comes as something of  a shock to the reader, as no doubt it did to Max when he was its victim. “‘Now stop!’ Max said and sent the wild things oV to bed without their supper.” Neither is Max con- tent to revel in the power of  his position. Having reproduced the legal order that Wrst demanded his obedience, he Wnds himself  “lonely” and dispirited (32–33). I want to take seriously the nature and implications of  this emptiness and where it leads Max. The essay now moves to consider the ways in which children experience moral development in terms of  their understanding of 114 </page> <page sequence="29"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love rules, and it is the dimensions of  this question that justiWes our move from Elias’ sociology to Piaget’s psychology. Again I want to argue that there is a ten- sion here between diVerent kinds of  relationships to law that might be described in terms of  obedience (or the suspension of  judgment) on the one hand, and responsibility (or the exercise of  judgment) on the other. Because Piaget is con- cerned with the internal world rather than the external conduct of  children, he recognizes the tensions between diVerent normative and interpretative ap- proaches as Elias does not, but Piaget’s resolution of  them is altogether too sche- matic. I will argue in the next section that Max’s “loneliness” dramatizes just this tension, and a careful reading of  Sendak’s book will lead us to an alternative resolution of  the question it poses about what it means to be legally civilized. Jean Piaget120 continues to be of  central importance to the Weld of  educa- tional psychology. Undoubtedly Carol Gilligan is correct to remark upon his somewhat authoritarian treatment of  his child informants, and his willingness to entice, demand, and even force their responses into the unyielding matrix of his pre-determined categories of  moral development.121 In all this he is dis- tinctly a creature of  the nineteenth century: a structuralist, with all the taxo- nomic eVrontery that applies. All the same, Piaget’s arguments for the stages by which questions of  morality and judgment are developed within children, remain persuasive.122 Although over-simpliWed, Piaget’s work is constantly inventive and, moreover, founded on a respect for how children learn and an attention to what they say, that remains, even in this day and age, quite radical. Let us look, says Piaget, at a context in which rules really are important to chil- dren—a game of  marbles, for example—and let us observe the way in which their understanding of  rules matures.123 Let us acknowledge, in other words, the idea of  play as the origin of  law. Amongst very young children, rules are treated as absolute and inviolable, and obedience to them a sacred duty. As we have seen, however, punishment for something done without intention is at the same time both unfaithful to the notion yet inherent in the experience of  disobedience amongst children. It was just that dilemma in which Max found himself  at the beginning of  our story. In order to make sense to themselves of  the way in which the fact of  a disobedient act may itself  merit punishment, children begin life as moral realists. Even a child of  seven or eight may speak of  a bridge that collapses as punishing the child who had been forbidden from crossing it; or the scissors that cut them as exacting vengeance on the child that had been barred from using them.124 A six-year-old may display Wnely-honed Jesuitical skills in the art of  casuistry. 115 </page> <page sequence="30"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 What happened? — The bridge cracked. — Why? — Because he had eaten the apples. — If  he had not eaten the apples, would he have fallen into the water? — No. — Why? — Because the bridge would not have cracked.125 In the animist and literal world of  the young child, everything is Wlled with a consciousness of  rules and the will to enforce them. Piaget concludes, “for since he takes rules literally and thinks of  good only in terms of  obedience, the child will at Wrst evaluate acts not in accordance with the motive that has prompted them but in terms of  their exact conformity” with the rules.126 This is part of  the logic behind Max’s abrupt announcement that sends the wild things oV to bed without their supper. Max is not expressing his mother’s judg- ment, but a fact about the world that inherently applies to wild things. He still understands law as being fundamentally descriptive rather than prescriptive. Going to bed without their supper is what wild things do. Just like Max.  As Piaget makes clear, the question of  fault or intention is not even relevant at this point.127 Rules have consequences and do not embody judgments at all. The reason for this approach is not hard to Wnd. According to Piaget, chil- dren’s early experiences of  the nature of  law are strongly inXuenced by the rules laid down by their parents, and these would often appear to the child as if  accompanied by an absolute authority on the one hand and an absolute obli- gation of  obedience on the other. In order to make sense of  the punishment of mere ignorance and experiment, childhood’s inherent predicament, children appear committed not only to the transcendent status of  rules but to their par- ents’ unblemished authority in divining them.128 The natural realism of  the rules is coupled with the privileged position of  parental authority as the chan- nel of  their proclamation. This comes close to sacralizing obedience and trans- forming parenthood into a priesthood. And how did your daddy know [the rules]? — My Daddy just knew. No one told him. — How did he know? — No one showed him! — . . . Tell me some people older than your daddy. — My grand-dad. — Did he play marbles? — Yes — Then he played before your daddy? — Yes but not with rules! [said with great conviction].129 At this point, Elias and Piaget part company. For Elias the sociologist, inculcating in children an habitual obedience to external rules of  conduct constitutes civilized self-restraint unproblematically. For Piaget the psycholo- gist, nothing could be further from the truth. The externalized and sacred 116 </page> <page sequence="31"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love objectivity that parental demands instill inhibit self-restraint. While Elias tends to treat physical habits as the natural progenitor of  habits of  mind, Piaget, for his part, focuses instead on what Hart might call “the internal perspective” of the habitué. Piaget here is particularly critical of  the connection between obe- dience and morality insisted upon by Emile Durkheim.130 Durkheim’s mistake, according to Piaget, lay in reducing morality to “a body of  rules sanctioned by society . . . which we obey because it is authority and for no other reason.”131 A civilized relationship to law requires far more than obedience to it, as Elias clearly recognized and as Hart himself  aYrmed. We need to internalize its demands and the habits of  mind it depends upon in order to function: we need to value it and to be able to interpret it for ourselves. This step is essential for the development of  self  restraint and discipline that is the hallmark of  modern man. But the nature of  language being as ambiguous and slippery as it is, no mere principle of  obedience can constitute this Wgure. Children understand, through their own bodies, that to be able to apply laws themselves, a priori, and not just to be a victim of  them, post hoc, requires a sense of  law’s justiWcations, its contexts, and its purposes. Only then, positioned as an interpreter and not just as a recipient of  law, can one internalize the restraints and norms of  society and treat them as one ’s own, as civility demands. Only then will we move, in the language of  Hart, from being an object obliged to follow orders, to a legal subject who feels a genuine sense of  obligation to the law.132 The problem as Piaget sees it, is that the structure of  absolute obedience of a child’s early life does not prepare them to take on these added burdens. On the one hand, the idea of  obedience demands of  the citizen nothing but the conformity of  their outward actions: they are not expected to have opinions, or judgments, or beliefs. On the other hand, its unilateralism encourages a bal- ancing egotism in the child (or the subject): since they are not expected to think for themselves, they can hardly be expected to think of  others. In attain- ing a bilateral relationship to legal rules, then, Piaget sees the unilateral respect that initially underscores absolute parental authority as an obstacle to be over- come. In this, Piaget displays a bracing hostility to the function of  parents in the child’s attainment of  moral knowledge. Autonomy and justice make their way in the lives of  children “at the expense of  the adult and not because of him.”133 Piaget postulates two incommensurable moral orders,134 the Wrst uni- lateral and authoritarian, the second based on mutual respect. This latter model teaches the child about the importance of  intention and motive, the relationship of  justice to equality, and the need to interpret laws in terms of 117 </page> <page sequence="32"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 their contexts and purposes. Piaget provides powerful evidence for the emer- gence of  this new language from the age of  about eight onwards and attributes it to “the intervention of  a new factor.”135 The supervening factor, according to Piaget, is to be found in the way that children begin to engage with each other on terms of  reciprocity and equality. The emergence of  genuinely co-operative relations, particularly through informal institutions of  play, transform the child’s comprehension of  law, its purposes and its creation, not only enriching the child’s understanding but allowing for its internalization. The civilizing process is accomplished, then, by children themselves—despite their parents. There is much that seems right in this analysis: above all, Piaget shows compassion and respect for children’s abilities. But just as Elias (and Durkheim a fortiori ) assimilates the constraints of  obedience to the emergence of  co- operation, treating the former as the natural origin of  the latter; so Piaget segregates the two, treating the latter as a radical departure from the former. In Piaget the two models of  reasoning are utterly heteronomous;136 one super- sedes and indeed “drives out” and even “delivers the child”137 from the other. Is there no relationship between the two then? This hardly seems tenable. A careful analysis must move from the conXation of  these modes of  legal reason- ing on the one hand, or their separation on the other, to their dialectic. And in this regard, Where The Wild Things Are proves an instructive text. In the next section I will look at Max’s “return to civility” with this problem in mind. In the prescriptive reading I propose, Max returns home not simply as an obedi- ent child, but, which is more, as a responsible one. The emergence of  this newly-responsible legal subject is the crowning feature of  the myth of  civiliza- tion that The Wild Things constitutes in its readership. Furthermore, I hope to demonstrate how Max’s story suggests that the emergence of  responsibility requires no deus ex machina, as in Piaget, but is already immanent in children’s own experience of  obedience. The Dawning of Responsibility And Max the king of  all wild things was lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him best of  all. Then all around from far away across the world he smelled good things to eat so he gave up being king of  Where The Wild things are. But the wild things cried, “Oh please don’t go—we’ll eat you up—we love you so!” And Max said, “No!”138 118 </page> <page sequence="33"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love Let us begin to think about the transition from an authoritarian to a more responsive understanding of  law. First, mere obedience to a text—just do as I say—leads inexorably to injustice: saying and meaning are two diVerent things. The injustice is both original and continuing. One does not have to be playing with other children in order to become aware of  this. Children’s sense of  unfairness is acute and sometimes noisy. Max experiences this injustice him- self, then imagines inXicting it upon others, and is left, perhaps, reXecting on his own capacity for violence. In Where The Wild Things Are, the inadequacy of  mere obedience as a model for law—understood, as I have argued, as man- dating actions and behaviour that conform without question to the authorita- tive demands of  another—is scarcely articulated. Nevertheless Max is depicted as lonely and unhappy: neither as the giver nor as the recipient of commands, neither as master nor as slave, is he content. Secondly, the theme of  the inadequacy of  literal meanings is developed throughout the text, right from the literalization of  wildness incipient in the incipit. Literalism leads of  its own nature to an awareness of  the necessity for a contextual and purposive reading of  texts. This Piaget failed to appreciate. Children have particular cause to be aware of  the diYculties involved in determining the relevant con- text of  a legal principle. They learn about these problems just by being chil- dren; they explore them in the games they play and the mischief  they make. It is not too much to say that since the imperfections of  an authoritarian model of  law are immanent within its own linguistic and structural postulates, Max’s exploration of  it in the realm of  fantasy may provide his readers with a way to begin exploring other possibilities. The child does not require deliver- ance from the oppressive model of  obedience; he or she requires only to reXect upon it. Immanent critique—this is of  course the Hegelian move. Piaget gives too little credit, therefore, to the child’s ability to critically analyze, over time, the contradictions and injustices of  an orthodox model of  law. The tools of  that critique already press hard upon the child’s own imaginative and emotional world. To speak of  the tools of  analytical reXection, means of  course those tools that are properly adapted to the child’s own state of  development and interests. Children’s books and role-playing games are the principal means by which they imagine themselves living in other contexts and circumstances. It is the singular strength of  Where The Wild Things Are that it develops the sub- stance of  a role-playing game through the form of  a book. Both the reader of and the character in the book, therefore, experience a moment of  reXection. Finally, Max’s emptiness leads him to conclude that he “wanted to be where 119 </page> <page sequence="34"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 someone loved him best of  all” (32). This is the pivotal moment in the book and I will argue that it can be read as suggesting a complex turn in the legal argument. On one level, it portrays obedience as a condition of  belonging in which subjugation to absolute parental authority is traded—for love. It is an invitation for Max to return, then, suitably disciplined, to a world that prom- ises to provide him, in return, with an inexhaustible love and protection. Ariès argues that the depth of  emotional investment in the lives of  their children is what leads the modern family to insist so adamantly on their training and awakening.139 Love and citizenship are correlative. Max must trade in his wolf suit—it is the price of  his domestication. As the necessity and the desirability of  this change and this exchange dawns on Max, he experiences an “awaken- ing” or Aufklarüng of  his own. He becomes a legal subject before our very eyes. And not to put too Wne a point on it, Sendak’s illustration likewise depicts sleeping monsters, and a solemn boy, all lit by a rosy-Wngered dawn (32–33). The parallels with Elias are unmistakable and convincing. This is a text of legal awakening. It enacts and realizes the child’s path to law. But I begin here and in this part of  the essay to move beyond Sendak’s text towards a normative position to which Sendak’s text only gestures. I would use Sendak’s book as a canvas from which to draw out an argument about the way to think about our relations and obligations to law. Here I think the text is open to diVerent read- ings and what the children who read it will take from it will depend on who is reading it. Of  course, this tension is faithful to children’s own experience too, since our desire to be wild is not by any means easy to reconcile with our desire for approval. SpeciWcally, I do not think that Where The Wild Things Are either can or should—since a manner of  reading necessarily involves the taking of normative positions140—be interpreted as the gloriWcation of  obedience, the obeisance to authority, or the commodiWcation of  love. Such an approach does no justice to our best relationships either to law or to each other. Max has been oVered solidarity and belonging, which is just what he cannot Wnd as a wolf amongst the wild things. But one might initially observe that the idea that obedience needs to be justiWed, in terms of  an obligation on the authority Wgure to provide something in return, already invites the child to evaluate the pur- pose of  laws in determining their meaning.141 One no longer simply obeys the law “for no other reason.”142 In Antigone, to have momentary recourse to another foundational myth of  law, the distinction is well dramatized in the argument between King Creon the law-maker and his son Haemon: 120 </page> <page sequence="35"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love creon : Shall Thebes prescribe to me how I must govern? . . . Whose business is’t but mine how Thebes is governed? haemon : A city is none, that to one man belongs. creon : Is it not held, the city is the king’s? haemon : Finely thou’dst rule, alone, a land dispeopled!143 A contextual approach has already begun to pry apart the “strict and complete legalism”144 of  the very young child.145 The child is beginning to see that the “why” of  law and the “what” of  law are inextricably connected. This is what Fuller calls its “external morality” and no system of  interpretation can func- tion without it.146 Furthermore, the promise of  obedience in exchange for love establishes something like a social contract and certainly establishes a relationship that is most assuredly no longer unilateral in its structure. Indeed, the text makes the bargain explicit. “Then all around from far away across the world he smelled good things to eat, so he gave up being king of  Where The Wild Things Are,” Sendak continues (33). And when he returns home “into the night of  his very own room” the bargain is consummated and consumed “where he found his supper waiting for him” (38–39). Once obedience is understood to derive not from the “command of  the sovereign”147 qua sovereign but, conditionally, in terms of  the beneWts it makes possible to a community, destabilizing elements of  critique—equality, justice, and participation—have already been injected into our understanding of  law. For the love that is oVered in return for obedi- ence is already social, is enduringly purposive. The pact of  civilization between parents and their children, forged on a bat- tleWeld littered with tears and tantrums, allows us to see the transition between Piaget’s two moralities, and not just their disjunction. Again, the transition is necessitated by an instability inherent within the orthodox model and not just antagonistic to it. Piaget sees justice as a social and interpretative exercise and Wnds it only in the community of  children inter se. But the social and interpre- tative meaning of  justice is already present even in a model of  obedience that simply cannot sustain its legitimacy—even to children, especially to children, though it may for a time sustain its power—without the commitment of  love. In that sense, therefore, a parent must already be “a collaborator and not a master”148 in the social life of  their children. Something more must be said about the too facile notion of  community.149 Sendak is there before us. Clearly, Max’s diVerence from the wild things makes 121 </page> <page sequence="36"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 him feel lonely. But the love for which he abdicates his crown is not simply a return to a familiar place where everybody is just the same as him. I do not want at this stage to enter upon a taxonomy of  love, or the distinctions between Wlia, eros, and agape in the literature. But I think it a fair claim that love in its various forms, when it is understood as a positive constitutive force, is built upon the recognition of  diVerence. It is therefore distinguishable from forms of  narcissism that merely seek or reproduce sameness. The very word relationship is integral to most understandings of  love; it implies a connection between two bodies that maintain their distinctness. To say “you are just like me” is just a way of  talking about me. Emmanuel Levinas explained this para- dox through the experience of  desire. The danger of  desire is that it “tends to bring the object ‘close enough’ to be engulfed” by the self, and consequently destroys the sensation of  diVerence that generated the attraction in the Wrst place.150 Such desire, like a parasite, consumes the host that makes it possible. Love, for Levinas at least, if  it is to survive, promises to respect diVerence and not to obliterate it. To further develop this idea, Levinas sharply distinguishes love from hun- ger, sign of  an elemental need which drives Where The Wild Things Are from Wrst page till last. Hunger may be characterized as the means by which the “alterity of  nutriments enters into the same.”151 In other words, eating takes components from the external world, and processes them into forms capable of  appropriation and use by the body. It destroys the other in order to turn it to selWsh use. This is the child’s Wrst process of  pleasure-seeking, and it is applied to every object that comes within reach: he or she grasps, brings close, and tries to eat. “All enjoyment is in this sense alimentation,” Levinas notes.152 But as Max discovers, the desire to be loved is not simply a kind of  hunger. Love involves a gesture outside of  oneself, and not just the grasping of  things to convert them into part of  oneself. Love is not just fuel; it must be a burning bush, alight but unconsumed.153 “We’ll eat you up—we love you so,” say the wild things, no doubt in their broad Brooklyn accents, neatly conXating hunger for another with love of  them (34). But Max and his readers have already understood on some instinctive level that this consumption is an utterly terrifying threat: it is a perversion of  love, the impossibility of  any enduring community, and it augurs the annihilation of  the child. It is nothing but emotional cannibalism. This is precisely what Max rejects. Of  all his exclamatory negations—“Be still!” “Now stop!”—this is by far the most courageous and decisive. “And Max said, ‘No!’” (34). 122 </page> <page sequence="37"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love To be loved best of  all is not then to be cannibalized. It is not only his diVer- ence from the wild things but his diVerence from those who form part of  his own community that structures the terms of  his new-found relationship to law. When Max says “No!” he displays a characteristic of  the modern legal subject of  profound importance, which Elias called its consciousness. Children in all societies still oVer examples of  people for whom the ability to see themselves and their companions from a distance, like spectators from the win- dow of  a building while at the same time walking along the street, is still quite unattainable. [T]hey are not “individuated”.154 Once one understands that diVerence and not sameness is the necessary condition of  any enduring relationship within a community, the implications for the legal subject are signiWcant. Jacques Derrida, not only in “Force of Law” but also in The Gift of  Death,155 argues on this basis against the com- modiWcation or codiWcation of  justice. No system of  rules can do justice to justice, since to treat like cases alike according to some pre-set formula, with- out more, would sacriWce the element of  the judgment of  diVerence that is equally necessary. In short, for a decision to be just and responsible it must in its proper moment, if  there is one, be both regulated and without regulation: it must conserve the law and also destroy it or suspend it enough to have to reinvent it in each case, remystify it, at least reinvent it in the reaYrmation and the new and free conWr- mation of  its principle.156 A rule can never capture the complex process of  judgment that must always be experienced as both bound and unbound, unique and universal. To be responsible is precisely to respond to the particularities of  a situation, and to make a choice in relation to it. Merely to apply in rote fashion the words of  a rule is no exercise of  responsibility at all, because it involves no decision at all; it is, in fact, to claim that one’s hands are tied. No one would ask a machine or the wind to act responsibly. Obedience, then, is the polar opposite of  responsibility. The recognition of  diVerence, and the necessity of  continually making judg- ments that attend to that diVerence, marks the end of  the possibility of  unques- tioning obedience and the true dawn of  responsibility. It is not too much to contend that the production of  the responsible subject is the dearest wish of  modern law. But too often it is forgotten that this means 123 </page> <page sequence="38"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 the subject who thinks, interprets, and makes choices in the application of  and in their response to legal rules. The two are intimately connected. Neither the juridical agent who enforces nor the legal subject who respects legal rules can express their obligation in terms of  simple obedience—actions in conformity with the instructions of  authority. Indeed, the story itself  strongly suggests that obedience without more is a condition of  savagery. On one level, the only truly obedient subjects in the story are, ironically, the wild things themselves. They are stilled when told to be still, rumpus when told to rumpus, and sleep when sent to bed (32). In all this, they are unlike Max. They are caught in vas- salage, tossed between extremes of  violence and fealty—unthinkingly, which is to say irresponsibly. Ironically, the poverty of  obedience contaminates the law-maker who demands it no less than the loyal subjects who provide it. As Piaget insisted, on the evidence of  his psychological studies, the relationship of  parent to child is, in its unilateralism, defective yet self-sustaining. It is striking how similar his argument is to Hegel’s analysis of  the relationship of  “master and slave.”157 The absolute authority of  the Master (or, in Piaget, the parent) eVectively relieves the Slave (or the child) from all responsibility, and permits, subject only to its commands, an utter egotism. Obedience removes the obligation to think, and in particular to think of  others. Yet at the same time the Master, like King Creon, has only his own desires to realize. He too, need never think, and certainly not of  others. “Finally thou wouldst rule, alone, a land without people,” as Haemon put it. Both master and slave, for comparable reasons, Wnd themselves walled up in an endless self-absorption. Perhaps it is signiW- cant that as king of  the wild things, Max’s crown looks a lot like the headdress of  his wolf  suit, which it almost conceals but does not at any moment displace (24–33). The unquestioning obedience of  slaves may be, Hart blithely con- cedes, “deplorably sheeplike,”158 while the sovereign whose absolute author- ity demands it is nothing but a wolf  in golden clothing. On another level, Max’s own obedience to and reproduction of  the rules laid down only intensiWes his disquiet. Perhaps Max sensed that it was irre- sponsible of  him to send the wild things oV to bed without their supper, in obedience to his mother’s rule but without the exercise of  judgment as to its meaning and purpose. This arbitrary injustice together with their unquestion- ing subservience to it—this mutually sustaining obedience—leads him even- tually to think more reXectively on his own diVerence from the wild things (33) and the diYculty of  acting responsibly towards them, and thereby exhibits 124 </page> <page sequence="39"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love a movement beyond Piaget’s Wrst-phase morality. Max then wisely decides to return to a community. Not, it must be said, a community in which the prob- lem of  judgment is solved because everybody is the same. But a community in which, nevertheless, he will be able to take responsibility. His new-found responsibility will be manifest not in his simple obedience to the rules laid down, but rather in the growing intelligence of  his interpreta- tion of  them. Moreover, the dream has told him something about the purposes of  the rule that ought to guide his judgments about, for example, the distinc- tion between “play” and “mischief.” Those purposes are characterized in Where The Wild Things Are, in terms of  parental or Wlial “love”; hardly a detailed explication in Sendak but nevertheless, in the vocabulary of  very young children, a powerful beginning to the interpretative project of  a life- time. Childhood, like feudalism, is a legal system bound by aVect. Love, as I have previously noted, has many diVerent theoretical frame- works and foundations. Sendak, unsurprisingly, does not provide one. The question is therefore, what, in terms of  the legal argument we have been developing, does the claim of  love imply here? What is being asked of  Max that is justiWed by love? I think that the love of  a parent and a child for each other ultimately involves the child (and the parent no less) in the awareness of the importance of  a relationship that lies outside of  him or herself. Understand- ing what it means to love another human being breaks down the wall of  self- suYcient egotism that Piaget argued derived from the unilateral authority invested in the parent.159 The experience of  loving another, of  being loved by another, will lead Max’s readers, and sooner rather than later, to be aware of just this otherness, this diVerence which it seems to me is the necessary condi- tion for the very possibility of  love. It is not too much to say that love involves a sacriWce as both its desire and its token. There can be no sacriWce unless we diVer from each other, for if  we were just the same, what would I be giving up?160 If  we were not diVerent, how could protecting your interests be distin- guishable from furthering my own? Children begin therefore to think about the consideration for diVerences that their play ought to show; moreover, that consideration becomes the very expression of  their love for another. They sacriWce, they give up something for somebody else. Thus we love and thus we show our love. In light of  the pur- posive structure of  love that the story introduces, Max’s mischief  consisted in the lack of  consideration he showed for the diVerent needs of  others (such as peace and quiet) in his play. Without love—from the perspective of  the pure 125 </page> <page sequence="40"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 “enjoyment” of  the infant—his mother’s rule seemed to impose a constraint which was unjust, incoherent, and therefore ultimately impossible to fulWll. With it—from the perspective of  the child’s developing community that nec- essarily includes an appreciation of  his diVerence from others—the rule has suddenly developed both purpose and content. Max can at last make sense of it. Now he can play responsibly. One might ask if  the responsibility that has been awakened in Max is itself  a purely unilateral burden. Do not then these reXections require of  his parents a more responsible sensitivity to Max’s own childhood in their obedience to the rules of  play they have enacted, so as not to reproduce the injustice under which Max Wrst suVered? Undoubtedly, and the dawning of  their own respon- sibility can be observed in what Max Wnds on his return: his supper. To con- serve the law, they have suspended it. PAR T  I I I .  T H E  HEAD  I N  T HE  WOR LD Learning Sendak “Off by Heart” The wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws but Max stepped into his private boat and waved good-bye and sailed back over a year and in and out of  weeks and through a day and into the night of  his very own room where he found his supper waiting for him and it was still hot.161 Every aspect and dimension of  Sendak’s “parable of  the law” maps precisely the odyssey described psychologically by Piaget and sociologically by Elias. But Where The Wild Things Are must be understood in two additional ways. First, the story confronts a jurisprudential argument—an argument about legal ethics—as to the best way to approach the interpretation of  law. The relationship to law that the story develops problematizes rather than merely sustains a lesson in obedience. Instead, it invites children to begin to see them- selves as actors in the play of  legal interpretation, and to reXect on the pur- poses and meaning of  law and not just on its force. Perhaps this is even what the Civil Code means when it obliges children “à tout âge”—which is to say, all of  us, all the time, since who is not a child of  some age?—to “respect” our 126 </page> <page sequence="41"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love parents. Not to obey, but to respect or to “honour,” which, as we have seen, is a far more sophisticated demand.162 In which case, the Code itself  contains within it an interpretative paradigm that might destabilize, from within, the strict positivism that has often plagued it. We ought to honour the law not just to obey it. The transition from obedience to responsibility which Sendak por- trays therefore moves beyond the synthesis of  the two in Elias and the antith- esis of  the two in Piaget. Whereas Levinas characterizes both these models as ways of  remaining mired in stasis,163 Sendak provides resources that might enable children to grow as legal subjects, à tout âge. Max ceases to be wild. But, unlike the wild things, he will not be tamed either. Secondly, the story confronts a jurisprudential argument—an argument about legal pluralism—as to the best way to approach the sources of  law. It is entirely inadequate to think of  this as a story about the law, or even as a story that portrays how children think about the law. It is not law “and” literature. Rather, the story helps form and develop the mental attitudes to law of  the children who read it. It does not just illustrate but inaugurates legal subjectiv- ity. It is law as literature and literature as law, which is to say, myth. Where The Wild Things Are is not a legislative instrument; its authority and inXuence on our habits of  thought and life is more profound than that. Ariès calls children’s books “propaganda”164 but that is too hostile a judgment. Such stories, are, in the fullest sense of  the word, constitutional documents. They are the epics and scriptures that sustain and direct our normative commitments at a formative stage of  our development.165 They provide strands in a web of  meaning that resonate throughout our lives. If  so, then the third stage of  our analysis must move beyond the hermitage of the text in which law and literature studies have too often been cloistered, and consider the process of  its actual reception. Reading is not of  course an abstract process, and the material and social circumstances in which it takes place will have speciWc eVects on what is understood by it. How is the text apprehended phenomenologically and in what ways does this supplement its meaning? The word “reader” is itself  ambiguous as between the reader of  something and the reader to someone. In silent reading, the two aspects come together. In children’s reading, the roles are initially distinct. This adds a signiWcant com- plexity to our understanding of  the constitutive process. The Wrst English stat- utes, likewise, were written for an entirely private audience.166 When they Wrst began to exhibit normative aspirations, around the end of  the thirteenth cen- tury, still they spoke to an audience that was essentially illiterate. So it was that 127 </page> <page sequence="42"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 they were read in public, and often enough the statute itself  would contain instructions that Cries shall be solemnly made in all Counties, Hundreds, Markets, Fairs, and all other Places where great Report of  people is, so that none shall excuse him- self  by ignorance.167 Here too, the young child Wnds himself  or herself  in a medieval world. They do not read, they attend to the reading of  others. They listen to sounds, and they listen over and over again. In all those who commented on this essay from their own position as parents or their memories as children, it was in fact the sound and rhythm of  Sendak’s words that formed the physical basis of their recollections. What has been particularly striking is just how solidly entrenched in memory are words that have been heard repeatedly. Even years afterwards, many people can still recite much of  the book from memory— “by heart” as the colloquialism rather evocatively has it—and make compli- cated assessments about whether the music or dynamic of  a phrase would have been better served by the substitution of  this word or that. Clearly then, oral reading profoundly enforces and reinforces, by a struc- ture of  complete dependence, the position of  authority of  the master of  the text, and may well be thought to conWrm the message of  obedience that forms one of  the strands, most assuredly, of  a book like Where The Wild Things Are. One can almost hear the voice of  Piaget: the child’s Wrst morality makes obe- dience to parental authority a sacred duty. To the illiterate child, the text is nothing but hieroglyphs, which is to say, “priestly signs,” and the parent is the priest who accedes to the mystery and the authority of  the text. The child experiences meaning only through the intercession of  God’s vicar on earth, which is to say, vicariously. The actual meaning of  this powerful process of  recitation, of  ritual, will depend on the social conditions that accompany it. This is a point of  central signiWcance to our study of  legal meaning in this or any other context. Too often literary texts are treated as self-suYcient entities. The governance of  the text and not just its meaning is the proper subject matter for the study of  law and literature. This is what is meant by legal discourse: speciWc, embodied, interpretative practices that work to stabilize the meaning of  Xoating signiW- ers.168 Children’s literature provides the paradigmatic example of  the implica- tions of  this general proposition. The text is not just aural, it is also kinetic: a phenomenon connected in the life of  the child to the room in which it is read, 128 </page> <page sequence="43"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love by whom, and under what conditions. In every society and in every household there are laws that govern the reading of  books, as well as laws discovered in and through the reading of  books.169 In the argument that follows, I am undoubtedly hypothesizing a particular kind of  family environment in order to conceive of  the circumstances in which the normative theory of  law I wish to advance might come to fruition. I would not for a moment suggest that such a reading-environment is predominantly or even typically the case. No doubt it is quite possible to imagine the child’s obedience being enforced by a home environment that is also authoritarian, where reading is a reward for good behaviour or punishment for bad, and the child’s role is purely passive. Be still, sit quiet, and listen. In such an environment, Where The Wild Things Are would form part of  a larger discursive strategy, and perhaps Spitz was right to criticize such an ethical implication.170 But I have argued against the inevitabil- ity or indeed the justice of  that understanding. A normative argument is natu- rally a kind of  fantasy of  aspiration. A careful reading of  Sendak’s parable oVers the potential to instill, under the appropriate social conditions, a much more complex understanding of  legal subjectivity. Many features of  the contemporary model of  “reading to”171 oVer even to the youngest listener ways of  participating in giving meaning to the text, and oVer therefore a path to responsibility. In the Wrst place, the question of  owner- ship is important. Typically, while the adult reader possesses the key to the meaning of  the book, the child possesses or is physically entitled to the book itself. The split subject of  the book, divided between proprietorship of  its physical form and its ideational content, must be reunited if  it is to have any meaning at all. So the child’s physical authority over the book goes some way towards countervailing the interpretative authority of  the adult reader. The nature of  this empowerment, moreover, contains within it lessons in mutual- ity. The relationship of  divided possession here is surprisingly complex and might well be summed up, both in legal and in psychological terms, as a trust. The legal institution of  the trust divides ownership in much this way, between the one who owns the physical form of  something and one who is entitled to beneWt from the use of  it. At the same time only the social institution of  trust between parent and child can eVectively reunite its physical form and the beneWcial meanings it contains. The child is well aware of  the double identity of  the book, possessed by both and neither without the other; it gives them a sense of  the necessity for co-operation and shared communication that Piaget, for one, does not recognize until children begin to play with other children. 129 </page> <page sequence="44"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 The constructive trust implicit in the act of  reading demonstrates that a parent is already “a collaborator and not a master.”172 Since the book itself  is external to the direct relationship between parent and child, as if  it were a third party, it presents the possibility of  an interpreta- tive experience in which both the speaker and the listener can participate. Nor is interpretation solely linguistic. It is also aural and pictorial, and those pic- tures provide a pre-literate child with the opportunity to read, to interpret, and to contribute their own observations on the unfolding story. Sendak’s illustra- tions are decidedly an important element of  any adequate interpretation of  the text. Furthermore, the exegesis of  the text is typically open-ended in its possi- bilities. Like Talmudic mishnah, the verses of  a book like Where The Wild Things Are form the framework for a conversation: about the story, about Max’s experience of  the story, about the child’s own and parallel experiences. In all these ways, the story provides a dialogic space for the acknowledgment and for the mediation of  children’s own emotions. It is standard practice for analysts and therapists of  many kinds to use the technique of  story-telling to encourage a child to narrate in the third person traumatic experiences that might be too diYcult to confront directly. Precisely because it takes a form external to the child’s own being, the story provides a safe and important medium through which the child feels at liberty to enlarge upon his or her own predicament. It may even provide a little child with an opportunity to express their anger at injustice. A careful parent will listen to the unfolding analysis of  a book by their children with equal care and attention, and will invite an extended discussion in every direction—at least until dinner is served. Sendak made just this point in accepting the prestigious Caldecott Medal in 1964: [W]hat is just as obvious—and what is too often overlooked—is the fact that from their earliest years children live on familiar terms with disrupting emo- tions, that fear and anxiety are an intrinsic part of  their everyday lives, that they continually cope with frustration as best they can. And it is through fantasy that children achieve catharsis. It is the best means they have for taming Wild Things.173 Crucially, the text is not just a description of  this cathartic event, but an occa- sion for the event itself, an invitation to a dialogue about feelings and experi- ences that both parent and child might share. 130 </page> <page sequence="45"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love Above all, the discussion of  the textual world of  a children’s book invites readers to explore the intentions and motives of  its characters. It therefore introduces readers to a certain mode of  interpretation. Why do you think Max did that? What do you imagine he is thinking? Why is he sad? It is scarcely pos- sible to look at a picture in a children’s book without oneself  posing those questions. The sparseness of  both text and illustrations implies a secrecy that demands investigation. Like the Mona Lisa, a good children’s book is inscru- table enough, and seductive enough, to incite its own supplement. Such gnomic utterances are not foreign to literature or philosophy: parables and aphorisms, meditations and pensées all rely on similarly sparse structures.174 The supple- ment is called forth by the form: more, it is the strength of  the form. Children’s imagination as well as their skills are thereby engaged (it is precisely on these grounds that the highly minimalist designs of  Dick Bruno175 have been widely praised). Indeed for many children, as I have been told by more than one of my colleagues, the highlight of  a reading of  Where The Wild Things Are comes at the moment of  the “wild rumpus” in which the wonderfully exuberant images that continue over three double pages—unencumbered by written text of  any kind—invites or requires an imaginative supplement through the improvisation of  sounds of  rumpus to which parents and their children both contribute. But this approach is anything but a literal analysis of  textual facts. On the contrary, it invites the child to make meaning by getting behind those facts. This is the exercise of  judgment that the child’s reading mandates; the judgment that the text alone cannot hope to provide. Children become mas- ters in the art of  interstitial interpretation on the basis of  their growing but always insuYcient comprehension of  the social world around them. They learn that meaning is terminally and constructively incomplete. Children Wrst experience reading, therefore, in a social environment—as catechism and antiphony. This inculcates in them a practice of  textual respon- sibility that goes far beyond the bounds of  obedience. It is perhaps obvious to note that this practice is particularly well suited to the interpretation of  laws that are themselves no less marked by a fundamental insuYciency in the face of  the social world they seek, and fail, to capture. The gnomic utterance is hardly more foreign to statute law than to literature; in the common law tradi- tion, at least, a case is perhaps best understood as a parable; the Code Napoleon is full of  its aphorisms and pensées. But more than this, Where The Wild Things Are is not only an example of  how to do justice to texts. It is a dramatization of it. There is a parallel between the form of  the book and its content. Max’s mother’s rule was itself  a complex norm that required Max to develop a far 131 </page> <page sequence="46"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 better understanding of  social contexts and purposes in order to enable him to interpret it responsibly, in other words, to exercise judgment. So the text informs its own reading practice and the reading practice informs its own text. In the book, Max had to supplement the words of  the norm in order to give it meaning. In the world, his readers must supplement the words of  the book of the norm in order to give it meaning. There is, of  course, no closure to this expanding contextualization. Rules are by their very nature inscrutable and in need of  interminable supplementation if  we are to interpret them and judge them. To read a law, then, is a process of  endless diVérance that “incites from its place of  hiding.”176 As children grow older, they develop their own semiotic competence. SuYce to emphasize the importance of  the structure of  reading itself  in the civ- ilizing process. As has been often noted, reading is a way of  disciplining the mind and organizing society. It instills habits of  abstraction and reXection.177 It encourages us to imaginatively observe the lifeworlds of  others, “the ability to see [our]selves and [our] companions from a distance.”178 In permitting read- ers, therefore, to think of  themselves as others and to think of  others as them- selves, we provide them with the skills to objectify and distance themselves from their present emotional state. This is precisely, of  course, what Max does in the story when he creates a Wctional text, a dream, and places himself  within it in order to explore and analyze his emotions. These techniques encourage exactly the habits of  self-restraint and emotional reXection, as opposed to reaction, that Elias insists are essential to the freedom and legal structures of the modern world. But it is not just Max who uses a Wction to achieve these ends. All his readers, in reading, do. The skill of  reading texts allows the unfolding of  complex chains of  event far into the future and long in the past. Without the ability to represent what is not present, without the capacity therefore to project oneself  or one’s ideas into an absence, there can be no morality (the point is a familiar Kantian one). And without a system of  iterability by which we can reincarnate or re-produce those representations accurately and consistently across time and place179 there can be no law, either. If  morality is temporal projection, then law is temporal introjection. Both require highly sophisticated practices of  writing and reading. Conclusion Sendak’s Wild Things is a myth that traces the emergence of  modern sub- jectivity in a young child and, through its power, works to constitute that 132 </page> <page sequence="47"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love subjectivity amongst its readership. It is a parable of  civility and legality that sustains and resonates with background myths of  savagery and dimly per- ceived memories of  feudalism. It is a chanson de geste of  modern jurisprudence, a Bildungsroman in the dual sense of  a novel about bildung and a novel that builds. Like all myths, it is neither true nor false, but forms one strand in a complex web that becomes true in all those who learn it “oV by heart.” So important are such texts that we need to take them seriously, to think through the many implications of  the text and the context of  its reception in order to properly assess the relationships to law thus constituted. These relationships are by no means unambiguous; in Where The Wild Things Are, for example, there is clearly a tension between obedience and responsibility running right through the book. The book does not, of  course, oVer a regulatory solution or a philosophical resolution to these tensions, but rather an aesthetic and emotional one. Let us dwell for a moment on the love that recalls Max and that Max recalls. It hinges on the trope of  hunger that gnaws incessantly at one from Wrst page till last. Sendak describes a movement from hunger to love which, as Emmanuel Levinas points out, is likewise a movement from the enjoyment of  consumption to the goodness of  non-consumption. Relationships with others require, Wrst and foremost, not the satisfaction of  our own needs (narcissism is merely the relationship between a person and their own image) but the desire to preserve, respect and attend to the diVerence of  another.180 This is “a non-possession more precious than possession, a hunger that nourishes itself  not with bread but with hunger itself.”181 Such a desire is unquenchable, “the desired does not satisfy it, but increases it.”182 Max, no doubt, gets his supper in the end, and it is still hot (40). Yet it would appear to have undergone a sea-change in the course of  Max’s ocean voyage. It is no longer merely the enjoyment of  a need fulWlled. As in most cultures, food has become the symbol of  a love and not by any means a substitute for it (39). It is no longer to be “eaten up” but on the contrary to be kept constantly replenished. The supper to which Max returns is not just rain but a rainbow: the promise of  an enduring relationship. One might well say then that Max returns with a greater and more diYcult hunger than he began with, for it is now “the Other’s hunger—be it of  the Xesh, or of bread”183—or for peace and quiet, one might add—that concerns him. This is what it means to be responsible for another. It is nothing but a matter of  “calling into question my spontaneity”—Max’s wildness—by the presence of  the Other.184 The importance of  this calling into question, as restraint and as a 133 </page> <page sequence="48"> Law &amp;  L i tera ture    Volume 15,  Number  1 responsibility to others, was what Max learned in the course of  the book. It would therefore be wrong to say that love is the exchange object or reward in return for which Max agrees to accept a certain responsibility.185 On the con- trary, responsibility and love are coeval.186 Each is the condition of  possibility of the other. Max has been enriched by becoming decentred.187 Just like the experience of a good book or an adventure, and through the medium of  the one about the other, he has “lost himself ” and thereby discovered something immeasurably more. This too Sendak manages to convey visually, for Max’s private boat was labeled “MAX” outward bound to the land of  the wild things, which is to say as he journeyed inward to face the demons of  his own subconscious (17). But his boat shows no such name as he is turns for home, which is to say as he jour- neys outward to be reunited with his family (37). Max no longer inhabits a purely egotistical vessel. There is a place for others in him: he is “otherwise than Max.”188 This is particularly apparent in the Wnal illustration, in which for the Wrst time Max is depicted bareheaded, his headdress pulled oV and crum- pled round about his neck (39). An outlaw, says Bracton, “is bound to no-one, nor anyone to him.”189 But Max has at last discarded the caput lupinum, and returned home a responsible legal subject. The contention of  this essay has been that an adequate understanding of  his responsibility to others requires of  Max both this radical de-centering of  his place in the world, which Levinas explored in Totality and InWnity,190 and a rad- ical expansion of  his interpretative horizons, which Levinas explored in Other- wise Than Being.191 Without the former, responsible love is not possible—only consumption. Without the latter, responsible law is not possible—only obedi- ence. Without both, there can be no communication between individuals. This is what binds the two steps together. Without the capacity to communicate with others, across diVerences in time and across the diVerences between people—the very diVerences that make communication desirable in the Wrst place, and a constant struggle withal—there could be neither love, nor law. For his part, the myth of  Max inspires and breathes life into his readers’ sense of  their own agency. This animating and constitutive force is the very prov- ince of  myth, which operates not propositionally but narratively and emotion- ally. Without this capacity to be aVected from the inside, none of  us would be capable of  growth and change. Sendak’s readers have set in place, through the medium of  Max’s story, the stanchions of  a web that asks them to accept a responsibility to understand and 134 </page> <page sequence="49"> Manderson    F rom Hunger to  Love make choices aVecting others, that they cannot evade or pass on. This is what the emergence of  subjectivity in human beings means: our subjection through responsibility to others.192 It implies, clearly, a radical orientation to the mean- ing and purpose of  law and the function of  the civilized citizen in relation to it. It should therefore not surprise us in the least to note that only recently a con- scious attempt has been made to place Levinas’ ethical principles, as I have lightly drawn on them here, in the simplest and most powerful of  normative forms: between the covers of  a children’s picture book.193 1. This article had its genesis in an essay written by Ms. Ellie Parker for the course Law &amp; Discourse that I taught at the University of  Sydney Law School 2000–2001. It was her idea to look at the Sendak story through the theoretical perspectives covered in that course, and I am entirely in her debt for the careful research she did for that essay, as well as for the ideas that she stimulated. Although the current essay has changed a great deal in both detail and theoretical focus since then, I am immensely grateful to Ms. Parker for all her work and her inspiration. I also wish to thank Nicholas Kasirer, Rod Macdonald, Peter Good- rich, David Carlson, Mark Antaki, Ellie Parker, Olivia Kasirer, William MacNeil, Steven Smith and his students, all of  whom commented—often with extraordinary care and in great detail—on early drafts.

My claim does not relate to any actual or supposed practices of  human Xesh eating in any community, about which the meaning, nature, and extent is strongly contested. My claim is rather about the way in which a certain image of  cannibalism has lodged itself  in the Western mind, and the way in which that image is constructed as a fearful archetype of savagery and a test, therefore, of  what we might in this context describe as civility. It is a question of  the way in which the symbols of  cannibalism have been developed and used within this particular culture: Lawrence Goldman, The Anthropology Of Cannibalism (London: Bergin &amp; Garvey, 1999); Reay Tannahill, Flesh And Blood: A History Of  The Cannibal Complex (London: Abacus, 1996); W.

Of  course many of  these assumptions about childhood and parental inXuence might be challenged from the perspective of  genetic determinism, given such prominence recently in work, for example, by Judith Rich Harris, The Nurture Assumption (New York: Touchstone, 1999) and Steven Pinker, The Blank Slate (New York: Viking, 2002). SuYce it to say that not only is the argument grossly over- stated in these authors, but they simply do not address questions of  value formation at this level. To attempt to elide this distinction, as Pinker has a tendency to do, is nothing short of crass polemics. 166. Manderson, supra note 114, at 327–30. 167. Statutum Wynton, 13 Edw.
