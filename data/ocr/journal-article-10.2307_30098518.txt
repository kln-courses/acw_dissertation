<plain_text><page sequence="1">Theocentric and Christocentric by CUTHBERT LATTEY, S.J. AM using these terms here in a relative sense, as indeed they are generally used, and not in any exclusive sense. Whether in matters mainly of doctrine or mainly of the spiritual life, the chief emphasis may be either upon God as such, or on the God-man, the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity become flesh, Jesus Christ. There need not be any opposition between the two viewpoints taken in themselves ; neither need exclude some emphasis on the other, or deny it to be possible and legitimate. Nevertheless in the writings and mentalities even of the saints we may sometimes observe one or the other to predominate, and in some cases we may even consider the general presentation to be so one-sided as possibly to be somewhat misleading. Following in the main a chronological order, it may be well to begin by taking some notice of the Old Testament, although here it is evident that there is hardly room for a strictly Christocentric presentation. But the anthropomorphic representation of the Godhead bears some analogy to the Christocentric presentation, for which it may be said to prepare in some sort the way. Thus in Abraham Heschel's book, Die Prophetie (Cracow, 1936), the distinction is drawn between " Anthro potropismus " and " Theotropismus " (pp. 113 if), and is followed by a chapter on " Die pathetische Theologie," which again contains a section entitled " Der pathetische Gott." It will readily be understood that the author is dealing with Old Testament attributions of various emotions to God, such as repentance and anger. But this topic is not so closely related to the subject of the present paper as to call for detailed treatment here. Coming therefore to the New Testament, we realize of course that the gospels may be said to be concerned almost wholly with the life and teaching of Christ, and in that sense to be entirely Christocentric. Never theless, St John's gospel lays so much stress upon the Saviour's Godhead that it may truly be called in a relative sense the Theocentric gospel. In its very first sentence it is said that the Word was God, and in x. 30 Our Lord declares, "I and the Father are one." St Thomas' con fession, " My Lord and my God " (xx. 28 was doubtless originally the climax to the gospel ; it is generally agreed that the following chapter was added at a later date, for xx. 30--31 were obviously intended as a conclusion. The Catholic view, however, is that the addition was made by St John the Evangelist himself. Yet the Christocentric side of his writings should not go without some notice. He knew himself to be the apostle whom Jesus loved, whom even Peter was fain to use as an intermediary with the Lord, and who</page><page sequence="2">70 Studies [SPRING could fall back upon His breast to ask a secret question (John xiii. 2 3-2 5 . He may well have been the beloved disciple of the Baptist also, after whom he may have been named, as indeed he may have been named in any case ; but he is all the more likely to have been so named if he were Our Lady's nephew, as would follow if (i he were the son of Salome (Mark xv. 40), if (2 Salome were Zebedee's wife, and thus mother of the sons of Zebedee (Matt. 27. 56), and (3 if Salome were Our Lady's sister (John xix. 25), in which case St John the Evangelist may have followed his rule of not naming himself one degree further, not naming even his mother. But these possibilities are not sufficiently germane to the subject to be discussed in detail ; it is enough to have pointed out that, as has been said, St John the Evangelist may have been Our Lady's nephew, though this cannot be regarded as certain. If it could be so regarded, it would certainly enhance the Christocentric aspect of the fourth gospel. One other detail should be added, itself also connected with the Baptist. It is St John himself who records in his gospel how the Baptist pointed out to him the Christ: "Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world " (i. 29 : cf. i. 36 . This would of course be understood in a sacrificial sense, and be connected with the daily morning and evening sacrifice of a lamb in the Temple, and more especially with the sacrifice of the passover. Such was the Evangelist's first impression of the Messiah, now come, and come to be sacrificed. It sank deep into his soul, and underlies the visions set forth in the Apocalypse of the Lamb that was slain (v. 6 . Even so St Paul received as his first great lesson from the risen Christ that He was one with His Church and all her members : " I am Jesus, whom thou dost persecute " (Acts ix. 5 : cf. xxii. 8 : xxvi. 15 : it is not persecution of His followers whereof He speaks, but of Himself. In an essay like the present, it is not possible to trace in any detail the influence of Christian thought upon the theory and practice of the Christian life, even in what directly concerns asceticism and prayer and mysticism. It is necessary to come at once to " Dionysius the Areo pagite," or, as I prefer to call him simply, Pseudo-Denis. In my note upon Acts xvii. 34 in the Westminster Version of the Sacred Scriptures, I have explained that the name and title were made to cover not only the Dionysius (?--Denis there mentioned, whom Dionysius, bishop of Corinth (end half of 2nd cent.), states to have been the first bishop of Athens (Eusebius, Church Hist., III. 4. 1 o : IV. 23. 3), but also the Dionysius sent from Rome into Gaul a little before the middle of the third century, who became bishop of Paris and was there martyred. But the third Denis definitely claims to be St Paul's Athenian con vert, " Dionysius the Areopagite," and endeavours to support his claim with a background of historical allusion. It may be as well to allude</page><page sequence="3">1954 Theocentric and Christocentric 7' at once to an excellent book devoted to him in the S.P.C.K. Translations of Christian Literature, and entitled Dionysius the Areopagite on the Divine Names and the Mystical Theology, by C. E. Rolt (1920). The author was a promising student who died prematurely at the age of thirty-seven ; he lost both his parents while yet very young, and from the age of fourteen was entrusted to the care of that well-known scholar, Dr Sparrow Simpson, and would certainly have reached great distinction in his work, had his health allowed it. Indeed, as Dr Sparrow-Simpson rightly claims, he actually accomplished a fine piece of work in his Introduction to the two works translated by him, The Divine Names and The Mystical Theology. The two other important treatises, The Celestial Hierarchy and The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, are not here translated. Dr. Sparrow Simpson himself, besides the notice of Rolt in the preface, contributes a useful bibliography, and a still more valuable dissertation on " the influence of Dionysius in religious history." It is this dissertation with which the English student interested in the subject will find it wise to begin ; evidently the present essay cannot attempt such a scheme, but must be confined to one or two considerations which are vital to its main plan and find constant application, even where attention is not explicitly called to them. " It is an interesting speculation for the theological student," writes the editor at the end of his dissertation, " what the position of these writings would have been, if their author had never been identified with the disciple of St Paul." One is indeed inclined to dub him the Jons et origo mali, so strong has his influence been in the direction of an extrava gantly theocentric attitude. About Pseudo-Denis himself we know next to nothing ; but the Dionysian writings belong to the end of the fifth century, and are strongly neo-Platonic. They were widely read in the eastern church, and had considerable influence in the West. " The Mystical Divinity," in the words of an old chronicler, "ran across England like deer." The basis of the teaching of the Divine Names and the Mystical Theology is the doctrine of the Super-Essential Godhead, which means that God in His ultimate Nature is Supra-Personal. Personality is a finite thing : the person is not the whole universe, but only a member thereof. But God is supra-personal, because He is infinite ; the consciousness we can ascribe to Him is a Universal Consciousness. We see the ultimate level beyond us, the Super-Essential Godhead which is the Absolute, the Ultimate Unity containing in an undifferentiated condition all the riches of consciousness, life and existence dispersed in broken fragments throughout the world. This undifferentiated Godhead cannot be called conscious, because consciousness implies a distinction between the thinking subject and the object of thought, even if the latter be considered as awareness of self. Similarly life, existence, unity imply distinctions.</page><page sequence="4">72 Studies [SPRING Ultimately the Godhead is undifferentiated and unrelated, but it is manifested under the form of differentiation and relationship. Some such inadequate summary of Pseudo-Denis's con300tion of the Godhead appears to be necessary in order to any understanding of the distinction between Theocentric and Christocentric spirituality, an understanding which may be carried a further stage by a careful perusal of the whole volume which I have made my foundation. What is it that follows for the spiritual life and prayer God, changeless and immaterial, must be sought through riddance of the changeful and material : the human spirit must go out of itself and be merged in the Super-essence, the Uncreated Object of its ecstatic contemplation, of the supreme unknowing. From a purely Theocentric view all this may be effectively worked up and sound beautiful ; but upon reflexion the convinced Christian must surely put his question : what about the Incarnation Dom Cuthbert Butler, in his valuable work Western Mysticism1 though indeed the title is misleading, seeing that he confines himself to SS Augustine, Gregory and Bernard-has made it clear at the end of the book how much St Augustine made of the neo-Platonists, " great and almost divine men." This admiration has indeed influenced a famous passage in his Confessions (Book 9, chap. io), which can only be quoted briefly here, the thought of himself and of his dying mother: " So we said : If to any man the tumult of the flesh grew silent, silent the images of earth and sea and air : and if the heavens grew silent, and the very soul grew silent ... and in their silence He alone spoke to us ... just as we two had but now reached forth and in a flash of the mind attained to touch the eternal Wisdom which abides over all: and if this could continue, and all other visions so different be quite taken away, and this one should so ravish and absorb and wrap the beholder in inward joys that his life should eternally be such as that one moment of understanding for which we had been sighing would not this be: Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord ?" 2 This is none the less true and beautiful because it shows a neo Platonic and Theocentric basis : yet how different from the simple and highly Christocentric thought we find so often in St Paul : " 'Tis no longer I that live, 'tis Christ liveth in me " (Gal. ii. 20 : " For me to live is Christ and to die is gain. But if to live in the flesh meaneth for me fruitful labour then, which I am to choose I cannot tell. I am caught between the two, my longing to set forth and to be with Christ for that were far better yet for your sakes to remain in the flesh is more needful " (Philip, i. 21-24 . Constable, 1922. '2 From Mr F. J. Sheed's translation: Sheed and Ward, 1943.</page><page sequence="5">19541 Theocentric and Christocentric 73 None the less Pseudo-Denis had a fairly triumphal progress down the ages, helped in England by the great popularity of The Cloud of Unknowing, which is explicitly based on his teaching : " Whoso will look in Denis' books," runs the text, " he shall find that his words will clearly confirm all that I have said or shall say, from the beginning of this treatise to the end " (chap. 7o .1 Just before these words comes a quotation from Pseudo-Denis which shows incidentally how Theocentric is the Cloud itself : " The most godly knowing of God is that which is known by unknowing."' In Chap. V the Cloud would banish all thought of " the kindness or worthiness of God," of Our Lady, of the angels and saints, because " it is far better to think upon the naked being of Him (God and to love Him and praise Him for Himself " : so that, as Father Baker writes in his commentary on the chapter, " our author utterly excludeth images out of his work," though " he must and loth allow the use of images till God calls the man to aspirations." Thus the thought even of the Incarnation is but a ladder to be kicked away when it has been climbed. Is Christianity to be reduced to this, and to be reduced to this as its best It must be realized how much of it must be discarded as a part of supposed progress : this is Theocentric Christianity pushed to extremes. Dr David Knowles devotes a careful treatment to Father Baker in his English Mystics3, to which the reader may be referred : one sentence may suffice here : " Father Baker was a convert to Catholicism from Elizabethan Protestantism, and it may be permissible to suggest that the mental climate in which his early life had been spent was unfavour able to the growth of the full devotional and liturgical life." Of St Benedict himself Abbot Butler writes emphatically in his Ways of Christian Life4 " St Benedict's own spirituality and piety may more rightly be called 'Christocentric,' for Jesus Christ is above all the central religious idea and motive of the Rule.. . The Rule begins with Christ, ever dwells on Christ, and ends with Him. The aspirant to the 600astic life is welcomed at the outset as one going to serve as a soldier of Christ ; the 600k is by faith to see Christ in all, in the Abbot, in the guests, in the sick, in the poor (Matthew, xxv ... by love of Him will he come to perfect charity ... he is to prefer nothing whatever to Christ." In this connection it is unnecessary to do more than mention Abbot Marmion's immensely successful work, Christ the Life of the Soul. (Sands, I 92 2 .

" All later generations of the Faithful owe in the first place to the Benedictine tradition, in the person of St Bernard, that strong Christocentric character of worship of the Sacred Humanity of Our Lord and loving contemplation of the mysteries of His life, that is the heart and soul of Catholic religion and piety ; ' also the fervent childlike devotion to His holy mother, Our Lady; and the wide-spread devotion to Angel Guardians and to St Joseph : a600g the most distinctive elements of our modern Catholic religious life."1 St Francis and his followers brought new fervour into the religious life of the mass of the people. He urged Holy Communion and reverence for the Blessed Sacrament, he introduced our modern realistic (not merely quasi-liturgical Christmas crib. The Franciscans preached in street and market-place, praying in the vernacular and using vernacular hymns, and they introduced the Stations of the Cross; they were thus to a large extent the founders of popular devotions. About the time of the outburst of Protestantism, Spain produced a galaxy of saints, a600g whom were St Ignatius of Loyola (d. 1556), St Francis Xavier (d. 1552), St Peter of Alcantara (d. 1562), Blessed John of Avila (d. 1569), St Francis Borgia (d. 1572), St Teresa (d. 1582), and St John of the Cross (d. 1 5g i . There is a certain unity a600g them, both of acquaintance and spirit. St Teresa and St John of the Cross hold a place second to none a600g the writers on mystical theology. St Teresa (b. I 5 I 5), was considerably older than St John (b. 1542), who consented about 1567 to join her Discalced Reform and the projected first foundation for friars. Both depict in the main their own experiences, and it must not be supposed that even the saints must follow exactly the same way. St John writes more theoretically, whereas St Teresa has a wonderful gift of describing tellingly her own experiences. St John's use of Scripture is mostly accommodated. " In one sense, St John of the Cross took up his pen in order to supplement the writings of St Teresa ; on several subjects, for example, he abstained from writing at length because she had already treated of them. Much of the work of the two saints, however, of necessity covers the same ground." 2 St John writes strongly against the use of the imagination, insisting that no created or imagined thing can serve the understanding as a means of union with God.3 But it should be noticed that in his Prologue to the Ascent he explains that in this work he is not addressing all persons in general, but chiefly some friars and nuns of the primitive observance, " who by the grace of God are on the pathway of this mount." Even i Ways of Christian Life, pp. 24-25. 2 The Complete Works of St. John of the Cross, translated and edited by the late Prof. E. Allison Peers : 3 vols.: I934-5 : vol. 1, p. xlix.

II, chap. 8.</page><page sequence="7">19541 Theocentric and Christocentric 75 so, there seems to be a real difference of teaching between himself and St Teresa, which she quite deliberately indicates. An instructive example of what has happened may be found in the Ascent, Bk. III, chap. 2, par. 14, where it said of " the spiritual man " that " all the things that he hears, smells, tastes or touches, he must be careful not to store up or collect in his memory, but he must allow himself to forget them immediately ... so that there remains no knowledge or image of them whatsoever in his memory ... he must freely allow everything to fall into oblivion ... everything that is natural, if one attempt to make use of it in supernatural matters, is a hindrance rather than a help." There can be no serious doubt that we have here St John's genuine text, as translated by Allison Peers from the critical edition of the Spanish text edited by Father Silverio de Santa Teresa, C.D. (==Discalced Car melite . But these words are omitted in the editio prin300s, and instead we read that " to forget and set aside knowledge and images is never applicable to Christ and His Humanity," and so on. Allison Peers himself was led to make his own reliable translation by such " timorous qualifications," as he writes, " of statements which have seemed to the interpolator over-bold." 2 Not indeed that there was no justification of this " timorous " attitude ; on the contrary, as he shows in his preface, the danger from the Spanish Inquisition was a serious one, and the attack upon St John " would probably have succeeded but for the warm, vigorous and learned defence put up by the Augustinian Fray Basilio Ponce de Leon, a theological professor in the University of Salamanca." 3 About St Teresa's attitude there can be even less doubt. She writes humbly, because aware that there were " learned and spiritual men " against her. " They say that anything else, even Christ's Humanity, will hinder or impede those who have arrived so far from attaining to the most perfect contemplation.... I cannot bear the idea that we must withdraw ourselves entirely from Christ and treat that Divine Body of His as though it were on a level with our miseries and with all created things." After having actually tried this withdrawal, her final opinion was : "I believe I was committing an act of high treason, though I committed it in ignorance." 4 This is an extract from her Life of herself, of which Allison Peers considers that the greater part of the second and final version was written towards the end of I565. (St Teresa was born in 1515, and died in 1582). In 1577 in her Interior Castle (Sixth Mansions, chap. 7, Nos. 6 f.), she insists more strongly and fully on the point. She admits that souls 11 Complete Works, as above : p. 233. 2 ibid., Preface, p. xviii. ibid., p. lxv.

Nevertheless, St Teresa maintains, such souls are mistaken in thinking that they cannot frequently think upon such mysteries, especially when the Church is celebrating them. They can comprehend the mysteries in a more perfect way, looking upon Christ in His passion, for example, with a simple gaze, so that the will is moved to long to suffer something in return. Meditation of this kind should certainly be practised, and it should be noted that St Teresa declares that it will not impede the most sublime prayer.1 Above I have mentioned the galaxy of saints produced by Spain in the sixteenth century. Of these three (St Ignatius, St Francis Xavier, and St Francis Borgia belonged to the Society of Jesus, and of these St Ignatius was obviously the spiritual master of the other two. Indeed, before speaking of his principles, chiefly as embodied in his Spiritual Exercises, it may be well to note the tremendous effect of the practical influence of his immediate guidance, which seems to be without parallel in the records of sanctity. His first permanent disciple, Blessed Peter Faber, was the first priest of the Society, and his work was typical of St Ignatius' earliest ideal of the Society, the missio or special "job," undertaken as expediency and obedience required ; it was becoming also that he should close his life as a martyr of obedience, coming to Rome at once at St Ignatius' sum600s when the heat was at its worst, only to die there. Of St Francis Xavier there is little need to write, since he has long been recognized as one of the great characters of history, and besides, the full and competent life of him by Father James Brodrick2 lays the full story before all who wish to learn of it. Above all, we come to realize how much he loved his fellowmen, especially St Ignatius and his comrades in the Society, and the heathen to whom he was devoting his life. St Francis Borgia became the third general of the Society, and thus had much influence on its developments, not least in Spain, where Blessed Peter Faber doubtless also had some influence in drawing St Alphonsus Rodriguez, that holy laybrother, into the Society. And St Alphonsus did much to enlighten St Peter Claver about his mission to the slaves, and to fire his zeal for that work. Finally, St Ignatius formed and guided St Peter Canisius in his work as apostle of Germany, and St Peter, together with Blessed Peter Faber, helped St Stanislaus to over come the difficulties of his vocation. 1 I have no wish to discuss the matter at length, but I think that Abbot Chapman meant much the same as this when he wrote : "I suppose you are aware that even the greatest con templatives must meditate." (The Letters of Dom John Chapman, O.S.B., ed. Dom Roger Hudleston, O.S.B. (Sheed and Ward, 1935). 2 $urns Oates, 1952.</page><page sequence="9">1954 Theocentric and Christocentric 77 So much briefly upon the burst of sanctity which cradled the Society of Jesus. For the principles which vitalized it we must certainly turn to St Ignatius' Spiritual Exercises. He may be said to begin and end with the Theocentric, with the Christocentric as the connecting link. To begin, because he would have us humble ourselves at the outset at our failure to observe even the most elementary rules of conduct, known even by reason, and enjoined by God by the very nature of His being, even as He Himself is known to man even by the mere light of reason. And with God Himself the Spiritual Exercises likewise necessarily end : all that God has done for us, including the Incarnation and the life and death of God the Son, only bring us back with fuller knowledge and love to what God is in Himself, the infinite summary of all that is good and true, deserving our utter devotion to Him and consecration. In the same spirit St Ignatius took as his watchword the greater glory of God, but insisted that his order should be called the Society of Jesus. This preserved the strong Theocentric emphasis that has always existed in the Church, but strengthened the Christocentric movement, which has been gaining ground ever since. This is evident chiefly in the increased devotion to the Holy Eucharist, and in the development of the devotion to the Sacred Heart, the latter closely linked up with the former. The reconciliation between the Theocentric and the Christo centric attitude if indeed it be right to speak of a reconciliation at all, as though there were need of something of the kind such a reconcili ation, let us say, for such as are not at ease on the point, is a firm belief that Christ Himself is God. From the Israelites, St Paul says, in declar ing their privileges, " is Christ according to the flesh, who is God over all, blessed for ever." (Rom. ix. 5). And St John enounces the same truth in more Theocentric terms, in words that went far to establish the same doctrine in the disputes of the first Christian centuries : "The Word was God ... the Word became flesh " (John, i. r, 14 .
