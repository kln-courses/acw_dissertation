Specifically, brands that offer a greater variety of options that appear compatible and require similar skills tend to be perceived as having greater category expertise or core competency in the cate- gory, which, in turn, enhances their perceived quality and purchase likelihood. Six studies support this propo- sition and demonstrate that compared to brands which offer fewer products, (a) brands which offer increased compatible variety are perceived as having higher quality; (b) this effect is mediated by product variety's impact on perceived expertise; (c) the higher perceived quality produces a greater choice share of the higher vari- ety brand, even among consumers who select options that multiple brands offer and (d) product variety also impacts post-experience perceptions of taste. The findings suggest that in addition to directly affecting brand choice share through influencing the fit with consumer preferences, product line length can also indirectly affect brand choice through influencing perceived brand quality. Key words: variety; consumer choice; quality cues; product line length History: This paper was received November 9, 2005, and was with the authors 4 months for 2 revisions; processed by Ravi Dhar. A basic assumption concerning the depth of a brand's product assortment is that offering consumers more options is superior to offering fewer options, for the simple reason that a greater variety of options can cater to a wider range of tastes (e.g., Lancaster 1990). This basic assumption has been challenged by recent research that has raised doubts about the wis- dom of offering consumers many options to choose from (e.g., Iyengar and Lepper 2000, Schwartz 2004). For example, Iyengar and Lepper demonstrated that consumers who were presented with a set of 24 jams were significantly less likely to purchase one of these options compared to consumers presented with just 6 jams. Other researchers (e.g., Dhar 1996, 1997; Greenleaf and Lehmann 1995; Tversky and Shafir 1992) have shown that offering more options can generate decision conflict and preference uncertainty, leading to decision deferral. Although these studies have provided important insights, we propose that the variety a brand offers also often serves as a quality cue and thus influences which brand consumers choose. In particular, we sug- gest that a brand offering greater variety of compati- ble options, that is, options that require similar skills, is perceived as having greater category expertise and, consequently, is more likely to be selected. Further- more, because true quality is often ambiguous, an initial belief that brands offering more options are associated with higher quality will influence subse- quent (perceived) experience with the chosen product. If these propositions are found to be true, it would suggest that when determining optimal product line length, marketers should consider both the direct and indirect ways in which additional variety can influ- ence brand choice. We begin with a discussion of prior research on the effect of the number of considered options on choice, followed by an analysis of the role of variety in brand evaluation and purchase. We then describe six stud- ies that were designed to test our predictions and the conditions under which greater product variety is expected to enhance brand perceptions. We con- clude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of this research. The Impact of Brand Product Variety on Brand Evaluation and Choice Consider a consumer shopping at their local grocery store who decides that they would like to buy some ice cream. They are confronted with an onslaught of options, with flavors ranging from Vanilla to Rum Raisin and brands from Haagen Dazs to Breyers. On this particular day, Haagen Dazs offers more than a dozen different flavors while Breyers only offers a couple. Assuming the consumer has no prior brand preference, which brand will they choose and how 460</page><page sequence="2">Berger et al.: The Influence of Product Variety on Brand Perception and Choice Marketing Science 26(4), pp. 460-472, ©2007 INFORMS 461 will the variety the brand offered influence their deci- sion? If they know they want Rum Raisin and only Breyers offers it, the choice is easy. But what if they decide they want a flavor offered by both brands (e.g., Vanilla)? Could the amount of variety each brand offers influence their perception of those brands and, hence, their brand choice? These questions apply broadly because most pur- chase situations involve brands that offer different levels of product variety, with the level of variety easily observed by the consumer. A good deal of research has assumed that, other things being equal (e.g., costs, shelf space), offering more options is bet- ter (e.g., Kekre and Srinivasan 1990, Lancaster 1990). Supporting the notion that consumers like variety, in certain product categories a reduction in assortment has been shown to lead to reduced sales (Borle et al. 2005). At the same time, offering greater product variety is usually associated with higher costs (e.g., Draganska and Jain 2005, Lancaster 1979); a firm's production costs often increase with the length of their prod- uct line. Furthermore, recent research has shown that more options can generate decision conflict, confu- sion, and frustration, leading to choice deferral or even no choice at all (e.g., Chernev 2003a, 2003b; Dhar 1996, 1997; Greenleaf and Lehmann 1995; Iyen- gar and Lepper 2000). Paradoxically, people choosing from larger variety enjoyed the decision-making pro- cess more, but they also felt greater frustration and difficulty with choice and were less likely to make a purchase (Iyengar and Lepper 2000). In many situations, however, the relevant question is not whether a choice will be made, but which brand consumers will select. When we go to the store in search of yogurt or need to buy chocolate for a friend's birthday, we have often already decided to make a choice but may be uncertain about which brand to purchase. How would the variety a brand offers influence which brand consumers choose? The literature on "too much choice" might indicate that consumers would avoid high-variety brands in antic- ipation of the difficulty of choosing from a large set of options. However, typical studies pertaining to the role of decision conflict (e.g., Dhar 1997, Tversky and Shafir 1992) and "too much choice" (e.g., Iyengar and Lepper 2000) have not addressed that question directly and have focused instead on whether a choice is made. Thus our focus is on a common situation in which the relevant issue is not whether a choice will be made, but which brand will be selected (given that the decision to buy has already been made). In this context, we propose that the variety a brand offers can act as an important quality cue, affecting the inferences consumers make about the brand and thus influencing which brand consumers choose. This quality cue may play a key role particularly when detailed attribute information is unavailable or under low involvement (see, e.g., Kassarjian 1978). Further- more, it may play a role both when consumers eval- uate each brand separately, such as when consumers consider a brand's end-of-aisle display or a brand that is sold through exclusive distributors, and when two or more brands' offerings are directly compared (see, e.g., Nowlis and Simonson 1997). The notion that consumers rely on cues to assess quality is well established and has been relied on in both marketing (e.g., Allison and Uhl 1964, Olson 1977, Mayzlin 2006, Purohit and Srivastava 2001) and economics (e.g., Klein and Leffler 1981, Nelson 1974). For example, in the absence of other diagnostic infor- mation, consumers tend to rely on price as an indica- tor of quality, particularly for experience goods. The reasons for using quality cues such as price, brand name, and manufacturer's reputation as proxies for quality appear rather straightforward. In contrast, the notion that consumers infer quality from the number of options offered by a brand is less obvious. We propose that offering greater variety with finer distinctions among items in the product line - chocolates with different cocoa content levels, or yogurts representing both standard and more unusual flavors - is likely to convey category expertise. To be precise, a firm that offers finer distinctions within a product line, as indicated by its wider variety, com- municates that it has core competency in the cate- gory (Prahalad and Hamel 1990) and has invested in learning the category details and dimensions on which consumers' tastes vary. Given the investment involved in developing such category expertise and the additional costs associated with offering greater variety, the firm has more to lose if buyers are subsequently disappointed by actual product qual- ity. In addition, consumers likely employ a heuristic whereby breadth of the product line tends to come at the expense of depth. Therefore, as long as the com- position of the brand's product line sends a consis- tent message, e.g., variations of gourmet chocolates as opposed to both gourmet chocolates and gourmet cheeses, we expect greater variety within the specific category to convey higher quality and, correspond- ingly, affect brand choice.1 As noted earlier, a positive effect of greater vari- ety on brand choice may simply reflect the fact that more options can satisfy more varied tastes. That is, a fit with preferences account indicates that offering greater variety increases brand choice through sales 1 Although there are many expensive brands that offer few options and are seen as exclusive and high quality, their perceived quality typically derives from their high price and features, rather than the level of variety offered.</page><page sequence="3">Berger et al.: The Influence of Product Variety on Brand Perception and Choice 462 Marketing Science 26(4), pp. 460-472, ©2007 INFORMS of unique options, or those that are offered only by the high-variety brand. If, however, consumers tend to perceive brands that offer greater product vari- ety more favorably, then they may select from high- variety brands even when choosing shared options, or items that are offered by both a high-variety and a low-variety brand. This prediction is expected to hold when the product variety applies to a compatible set of options that conveys depth in a focused area, such as variations of dark chocolate, mountain bicycles, or bird-watching binoculars.2 It is not expected to hold, and might even be reversed, when the broader variety contains options of different types, such as a product assortment that contains both ice skates and running shoes. Product perceptions influenced by compatible prod- uct variety are also expected to influence actual prod- uct experience, particularly when the experience is ambiguous. Consistent with work regarding influ- ences on perceived sensory experiences (e.g., Levin and Gaeth 1988, Nowlis and Shiv 2005), we can expect that the higher perceived quality of brands offering greater variety might lead consumers to believe that the high variety brand actually tastes or performs bet- ter. If such an effect occurs, it would imply that offer- ing high brand variety can have a long-term effect by generating not only higher trial rates, but also a higher likelihood of repeat purchase. Our predictions regarding the effect of product variety on brand perception and choice were tested in six studies. The first study focuses on the effect of product set size on brand choice, holding the effec- tive choice set constant. The next two studies employ a between-subjects design to test more directly the effect of product variety on perceived brand quality (Study 2) and taste (Study 3). Study 4 examines our proposed causal path, investigating whether (a) vari- ety's influence on brand choice is mediated by qual- ity perceptions and (b) variety's effect on perceived quality is mediated by the influence of variety on per- ceived category expertise. The last two studies inves- tigate key boundary conditions. Study 5 tests whether the impact of product variety is still observed when the available option set represents only part of the brand's product line. Study 6 examines the moderat- ing role of the option set compatibility. Study 1: Product Variety and Brand Choice Our first study provides an initial test of the impact of product variety on brand choice and perceived brand quality. Participants selected a chocolate from one of two chocolate brands that differed in the total number of options they offered. They then tasted the selected chocolate and rated the quality of both brands. Impor- tantly, a subset of the options (the most popular chocolates based on a pilot study) were offered by both brands (" shared options"). We expected that par- ticipants would be more likely to select the shared options from the larger variety brand, even though the same chocolates were offered by the smaller vari- ety brand. Method A table was set up in front of the university book- store, offering a "Free Chocolate Tasting." The thirty- three participants were presented with two chocolate brands side-by-side and asked to select and taste a chocolate from the display. They were given a description of each brand and told that "the entire set of chocolates offered by each brand appears on the table in front of you." Brand names (Au Due de Praslin and Arnaud Soubeyran) and descriptions were adopted from Chernev (2003a) and were rotated across participants to control for name /description- specific effects. Because no brand-name effects were found, the data reported below were pooled across brand presentations. Chocolates were arranged in rows of five. One brand offered 30 chocolates (larger variety) while the other offered ten chocolates (smaller variety). The smaller variety brand offered the ten most popu- lar chocolates, whereas the larger variety included 20 additional, less popular items. Thus, participants who selected one of the ten popular chocolates tasted the same chocolate regardless of which brand they selected it from. Participants were asked to "write down the option you would be most likely to buy and the name of the brand offering this option." After tasting their selected option, they turned over the page and com- pleted the dependent measures. Specifically, they were told the experimenter was "interested in your perceptions of both brands of chocolates (not the spe- cific chocolate you tasted)." For each brand, they rated brand quality (1 = Low Quality, 7 = High Quality), as well as likelihood of purchase ("If you were purchas- ing chocolates, how likely would you be to buy each of the brands," 1 = Not Likely, 7 = Very Likely). Results Not surprisingly, participants were more likely to select an option from the brand offering more variety 2 Compatibility differs from assortment alignability (Gourville and Soman 2005) because it focuses on the inferences made from the consistency of the set rather than the difficulty of choice. Alignabil- ity suggests that consumers may be less likely to choose brands whose options vary simultaneously along multiple noncompen- satory dimensions (e.g., a car with a sunroof versus a car with a leather interior) because it makes choice between the options more difficult. But regardless of whether the act of choice is easy or dif- ficult, we suggest that if the offered option set is compatible, con- sumers may perceive the brand more favorably and be more likely to choose it relative to other brands.</page><page sequence="4">Berger et al.: The Influence of Product Variety on Brand Perception and Choice Marketing Science 26(4), pp. 460-472, ©2007 INFORMS 463 (79%) than the brand offering smaller variety (21%), X2{1, N = 33) = 10.94, p &lt; 0.01. The key test, however, focused on the 73% of all participants who chose one of the shared options. As expected, more participants selected shared options from the brand that offered larger variety, 71% versus 29%, *2(1, N = 24) = 4.17, p &lt; 0.04. Finally, quality ratings were higher for the brand offering greater variety (Mlarger variety = 6.50 ver- sus Hmaller variety = 5.56, f(33) = 3.01, p &lt; 0.01), and participants reported being more likely to purchase the larger variety brand (Mlarger variety = 6.03 versus *U variety = 4.85, t (33) = 3.74, p &lt; 0.001). Discussion The results of Study 1 demonstrate the impact of product variety on brand choice. Even when focusing on identical options offered by both brands, partici- pants were more likely to choose a chocolate when it was offered by the high- variety brand. The results also provide a preliminary indication that greater product variety is associated with higher perceived quality. However, this finding of Study 1 might have rival explanations. In particular, the measured differ- ences in quality perceptions could have been due to dissonance reduction and preference for consistency: participants tended to choose from the brand offer- ing greater variety and justified their selection by rat- ing their choice as having higher quality. This finding might also be explained based on research regarding focus-of-comparison effects (e.g., Dhar and Simonson 1992). Further, though we had no reason to believe that Study 1 suffered from demand effects, the use of a within-subject test does raise that possibility. To deal with these alternative accounts, Study 2 uses a between-subjects design where participants see only one brand, offering either a smaller or larger set of options. Study 2: Variety, Quality Perceptions, and Choice Experience As indicated, the proposition that greater product variety enhances a brand's choice probability may ap- pear inconsistent with evidence that larger choice sets create conflict and frustration and may thus diminish purchase likelihood (e.g., Iyengar and Lepper 2000). However, we propose that greater choice difficulty notwithstanding, in the typical case in which the rele- vant question is which brand will be selected, higher product variety enhances a brand's perceived qual- ity and thus also its purchase likelihood. Accordingly, in Study 2 we simultaneously examine the impact of product variety on the choice experience, perceived quality, and purchase likelihood. That is, Study 2 tests whether offering more variety can enhance quality perceptions even though a larger set makes choosing from the set more difficult and frustrating. Method The study was again conducted in front of the uni- versity bookstore. Respondents (N - 50) were invited to participate in a "Free Chocolate Tasting" and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In the smaller variety condition, the brand offered 10 choco- lates arranged on a table in two rows of five, whereas the larger variety group saw 30 chocolates arranged in six rows of five. Each item was labelled (e.g., "English Walnut Cluster"). In the smaller variety condition, three groups of ten chocolates were rotated such that every chocolate in the larger variety also appeared in one of the smaller variety rotations. Participants were informed that researchers were interested in consumer perceptions of the chocolate brand, and that the set of chocolates on the table represented all the chocolates that a particular brand offered. They were told that they could taste any chocolate, after which they were asked to complete a short survey regarding their evaluations of the brand. Participants were first asked to "look at the names of the chocolates and the chocolates themselves and write down which one you would buy for your- self." After selecting the chocolate, they were invited to taste that chocolate and were then asked to turn the page and complete a number of dependent mea- sures. The first two measures referred to product qual- ity, including (a) "quality of this chocolate brand" (1 = Low Quality, 7 = High Quality), and (b) the pos- itivity of their brand perceptions (1 = Not At All Pos- itive, 7 = Very Positive). The two brand perceptions measures were highly correlated (r = 0.72) and were averaged to form a brand perception index. Next, participants answered questions about the choice process itself (adopted from Iyengar and Lep- per 2000). Specifically, participants rated the degree to which the choice process was difficult ("Did you find it difficult to make your selection of which chocolate to pick?") and frustrating ("How frustrated did you feel when making the choice?") on 7-point scales (1 = Not At All, 7 = Extremely). Results Consistent with prior research, when the brand offered more options, choosing an option was rated as more difficult (Mlarger variety = 4.16 versus Hmaiier variety = 3.08, £(48) = 2.05, p &lt; 0.05) and more frustrating (Mlarger variety = 3.16 versus Msmaller variety = 2.20, f(48) = 2.18, p &lt; 0.05). However, as pre- dicted, when the brand offered greater variety it was perceived as having higher quality chocolates (Mlarger variety = 5.72 versus M^^ variety = 4.80, t (48) = 3.04, p &lt; 0.05). Discussion The finding that the variety a brand offers positively influences quality perceptions, even in a case where</page><page sequence="5">Berger et al.: The Influence of Product Variety on Brand Perception and Choice 464 Marketing Science 26(4), pp. 460-472, ©2007 INFORMS it makes actual choice more difficult, underscores the effect of product variety on perceived brand qual- ity. The results of Study 2 also suggest that quality inferences based on variety can occur in situations of single-brand evaluation, such as shopping on a brand's website. Furthermore, increasing the variety a brand offered enhanced quality evaluations of that brand even after participants were given the oppor- tunity to experience actual quality. Thus, the demoti- vating impact of large choice sets notwithstanding, it seems that offering increased variety can enhance the quality perceptions of a brand. This conclusion, however, does not address the pos- sibility that participants perceived the large variety brand as offering higher quality because they were more likely to identify a chocolate that matched their specific taste from the larger set of options. We exam- ine this rival account in Study 3 by isolating the effect of perceived product variety, such that the effective set of options from which participants can make a selection is held constant across conditions. In addi- tion, Study 3 tests whether greater variety can affect not just perceived quality, but also purchase likeli- hood and post-consumption perceptions of taste. Study 3: Product Variety and Sensory Experience Brand quality can be a somewhat ambiguous term, whereas the taste of a food product has a more con- crete meaning that involves one of the basic senses. It is thus interesting to examine whether greater vari- ety can also impact perceived taste after consumers get an actual taste of the product. It is also note- worthy that real-world sensory experiences typically involve separate "between-subjects" evaluations. For example, although consumers may consider different brands at the store or different entrees on a restau- rant menu, they often select just one and do not have the benefit of simultaneously experiencing mul- tiple options. We therefore examine, using a between- subjects design, whether selecting an option from a brand that offers a large product assortment produces more positive (perceived) sensory experiences. In addition, though we controlled for brand qual- ity in Study 2 and rotated the actual stimuli used, one could argue that the observed effect of vari- ety was due to the greater likelihood that the high variety brand offered participants a more preferred option. To control for this rival explanation, Study 3 used a design that ensured that the available option set was identical in the "larger" and "smaller" set. That is, in a between-subjects design we restricted the options participants could select, such that both those shown the small set and those exposed to the large set had the same effective choice set. Specifically, the two groups were shown either 30 chocolates or 13 chocolates, but only (the same) ten items were actu- ally available for choice. Thus the variety the brand offered differed between conditions, but the actual options they could select from did not. Method Participants were 90 university staff and students, who were paid $20 for completing a "Chocolate Tast- ing survey" and additional studies. They were told that the experimenters were "doing a market research study for a brand of chocolates that is consider- ing expanding into the U.S. market" and they were shown a display containing the set of options offered by that brand. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two chocolate display conditions. In the smaller variety condition, the brand display included 13 chocolates, arranged in two rows of five and one row of three. In the larger variety condition, the brand offered 30 chocolates, arranged in six rows of five chocolates. Chocolate were labelled, and a sign indi- cated that participants could "select from the top 2 rows only." Thus participants in both groups had the same effective choice set of ten options. Participants received the chocolate they selected, and after eating that chocolate, completed the depen- dent measures. Specifically, they rated the taste of their selected option ("How tasty was the chocolate you sampled," 1 = Not at all, 7 = Extremely) and their purchase likelihood ("How likely would you be to purchase this brand," 1 = Not at all, 7 = Extremely). Results As predicted, despite the fact that participants chose from the same effective set in both conditions, the presented product variety offered by the brand pos- itively affected the chocolate's taste ratings, f(88) = 2.45, p &lt; 0.01. Participants rated the tasted choco- late as more tasty when the brand offered larger (M = 6.28), as opposed to smaller (M = 5.78) variety. Furthermore, consistent with the earlier studies, par- ticipants who tasted one of the available ten items indicated a higher purchase likelihood when these chocolates were part of the larger chocolate assort- ment (Mlargervariety = 5.87 versus M^ier variety = 4.72, t (88) = 3.43, p &lt; 0.01). Discussion The results of Study 3 are noteworthy in two respects. First, the positive effect of the brand's product variety was observed even though participants chose from the exact same option set in both the "smaller" and "larger" variety conditions. Second, when the brand offered greater variety, participants found the same chocolates to be tastier and indicated a higher likeli- hood of purchasing that brand. These results suggest</page><page sequence="6">Berger et al.: The Influence of Product Variety on Brand Perception and Choice Marketing Science 26(4), pp. 460-472, ©2007 INFORMS 465 that a brand offering a larger variety is more likely to be sampled and, after actual experience, consumers are likely to perceive it as superior even on a concrete dimension such as taste. The finding that variety affected brand perceptions after tasting the chocolate is also important because the impact of quality cues tends to be weaker in the presence of other cues. For example, the signif- icance of price as a quality cue has been shown to be greatly diminished when additional information (e.g., brand name) about the product is available (e.g., Olson 1977). Conversely, the variety cue "withstood" a source of quality information that is likely to be more meaningful than extrinsic cues such as a brand name - the actual taste of the product. Study 4: Variety, Perceived Expertise, and Quality The first three studies provide convergent evidence that the product variety offered by a brand can influ- ence quality perceptions and brand choice. How- ever, none of these studies has allowed us to directly investigate the causal path by which these effects occur. In particular, our earlier analysis indicates that (a) variety can impact brand choice through influenc- ing brand quality perceptions, which is (b) due to the effect of variety on perceived category expertise. Accordingly, Study 4 tests the effect of product variety in two categories, focusing on the mechanisms under- lying these effects. Participants received information about a few brands (first binoculars and then chocolates) and were asked to evaluate each brand on a number of dimen- sions, including product quality and the brand's category expertise. The only difference between con- ditions was the amount of variety offered by the brand. They also then chose between this target brand and an alternative brand. We expected that (a) brands would be seen as having higher category expertise when they offered greater variety, (b) expertise would mediate the influence of variety offered on quality perceptions, and (c) quality perceptions would medi- ate the influence of variety offered on brand choice. To test for a possible halo effect, we also included items (price and exclusivity) that were not expected to be influenced by product variety. Method Respondents (N = 76) completed a "Brand Percep- tion Study" over the Web in exchange for a $5 Ama- zon.com gift certificate. They were randomly assigned to either the smaller or larger variety condition in each category. They were told that the experimenters were "interested in how consumers evaluate com- panies and their brands," and that they would be shown "the entire product line offered by an exist- ing company or a foreign company that is getting ready to enter the U.S. market with one of their product lines." Participants first received information about the assortment offered by a brand of binocu- lars (Bushnell), and after completing the dependent measures, were given information about a chocolate brand (Au Due de Praslin). In the smaller [larger] variety condition, the binocular brand offered 4 [16] pairs of binoculars and the chocolate brand offered 10 [30] chocolates. Brand descriptions were adapted from websites of actual products in the category, and the two condi- tions differed only in the amount of variety the brand offered. For the binoculars brand, participants read that "Bushnell offers durable and affordable binocu- lars, in compact to full-sized, with fully coated optics. InstaFocus® system for fast focus on moving tar- gets. Nonslip rubbergrip pads for secure grip in all weather conditions. Available in 4 [16] different mod- els, it's easy to see why Bushnell is a good choice." For the chocolate brand, participants read "Created in the 17th century, this chocolate confectionary was named after the Due De Praslin. Since then Due De Praslin chocolates have been a legendary symbol of 'art de vivre.' These delectable chocolates are a mix- ture of distinction, frivolity, and improvisation. Avail- able in 10 [30] different varieties, these chocolates are the true taste of a historic creative culture" (adapted from Chernev 2003a). Participants were then pre- sented with an array filled with images of the brand's product offerings: rows of four options in the binocu- lar category and rows of five options in the chocolate category. After reading the description and viewing the as- sortment, participants rated the brand on a number of dimensions with question order randomized to control for order effects. They rated product qual- ity: "the likely quality of the company's binoculars/ chocolates" (1 = Very Low Quality, 7 = Very High Quality). Participants also rated the category expertise of the brand ("How much expertise do you think the company has in the product category," "How much knowledge do you think the company has regard- ing the product category," "How committed do you think the company is to success in the U.S. binoc- ulars/chocolates market," "How committed do you think the company is to the product category," and "How invested do you think the company is in the product category," all on 7-point scales).3 As expected, the five items were highly correlated (a &gt; 0.83) and were averaged to form an expertise index. 3 Perceptions of a brand's commitment to, investment in, and exper- tise in the category are closely linked because the development of expertise requires an investment in and commitment to the category.</page><page sequence="7">Berger et al.: The Influence of Product Variety on Brand Perception and Choice 466 Marketing Science 26(4), pp. 460-472, ©2007 INFORMS As indicated, two additional measures were in- cluded to test whether ratings were driven by a halo effect, whereby the larger variety brand would be rated more favorably on all dimensions, including those not implied by our theoretical analysis. Specifi- cally, although it is conceivable that a brand offering a greater variety would be assumed to be more exclu- sive and /or cost more than a brand offering fewer items, that relation is likely to be weaker. Accordingly, respondents also rated the brand in terms of price ("What do you think the price of the brand is relative to other binoculars /chocolates on the market/' 1 = Much Cheaper, 7 = Much More Expensive) and exclu- sivity ("How exclusive is the brand relative to the typical U.S. binocular/chocolate brand," 1 = Much Less Exclusive, 7 = Much More Exclusive). Finally, in each category, respondents were told to imagine that they were looking to buy a certain type of binoc- ulars/chocolate that was offered by both the tar- get brand (Bushnell/Au Due de Praslin) and another brand (Minolta /See's), and asked which brand they would choose. Results Assortment Effects on Choice, Quality Percep- tions, and Category Expertise. Table 1 summarizes the results. As predicted, the product variety offered influenced brand choice; participants were more likely to choose the target brand over the alterna- tive brand when the former offered greater variety. Specifically, 65% of the respondents indicated they would purchase the target binocular brand when it offered larger variety, compared to 46% when it offered smaller variety, *2(1, N = 76) = 2.69, p &lt; 0.10. Similarly, 72% chose the target chocolate brand when it offered larger variety, compared to 49% who chose it when it offered smaller variety, ^2(1, N = 76) = 4.26, p &lt; 0.04. As expected, product variety influenced quality per- ceptions and perceived category expertise, whereas it did not influence price or exclusivity. In both cate- gories, brand quality perceptions were higher when Table 1 Study 4: Influence of Variety Offered on Choice Share, Perceptions of Quality, and Category Expertise Choice share (%) Quality perceptions Category expertise Binoculars Larger variety 65 5.62 (0.98) 6.09 (0.78) Smaller variety 46 5.00 (1.12) 5.16(1 .04) Chocolates Larger variety 72 5.85 (0.81 ) 5.90 (0.62) Smaller variety 49 5.08 (1 .40) 5.26 (1 .00) Note.

Vari- ety also impacted positively perceived category exper- tise: when the brand offered larger variety, it was perceived as having greater expertise (t(74) = 4.34, p &lt; 0.001 and £(74) = 3.37, p &lt; 0.001). Finally, prod- uct variety did not affect either perceived price (p's &gt; 0.14) or perceived exclusivity (chocolates, p &gt; 0.25),4 indicating that a halo effect did not play a signifi- cant role. Mediational Analyses. We next performed two media tional analyses (Baron and Kenney 1986) to test our hypothesized causal path. Specifically, we tested (a) whether quality perceptions mediated the influ- ence of variety on brand choice, and (b) whether per- ceived brand category expertise mediated the impact of variety on quality perceptions. In our first set of analyses, all four conditions for mediation were met in both categories, suggesting that quality perceptions fully mediated the influence of product variety on brand choice (see Figure 1). Variety offered was correlated with brand choice (binoculars j8 = 0.19, p &lt; 0.10 and chocolates, j8 = 0.24, p &lt; 0.05, Step 1) and was also correlated with quality perceptions (J3 = 0.29 and p = 0.32, p's &lt; 0.01). How- ever, when both variety offered and quality percep- tions were simultaneously included in a regression predicting brand choice, quality perceptions was a significant predictor (0 = 0.43 and p = 0.25, p's &lt; 0.05) but variety offered was not (j8 = 0.07 and j8 = 0.16, ns). Finally Sobel tests (Sobel 1982) revealed signif- icant effects for both categories (binoculars z = 2.68 p's &lt; 0.01; chocolates z = 4.39, p's &lt; 0.01), indicating that the effect of variety offered on brand choice was fully mediated by quality perceptions. All four requirements were also met in our second set of analyses, indicating that perceived expertise did, in fact, fully mediate the relationship between variety and quality perceptions (see Figure 1). Vari- ety offered was correlated with quality perceptions (binoculars, j8 = 0.29, and chocolates, ]8 = 0.32, p's &lt; 0.01) and was also correlated with perceived exper- tise (fi = 0.45 and ]3 = 0.37, p's &lt; 0.001). However, when both variety offered and perceived expertise were simultaneously included in a regression pre- dicting quality perceptions, perceived expertise was a significant predictor (/3 = 0.77 and j8 = 0.61, p's &lt; 0.001), whereas product variety was not (j8 = 0.08 and j8 = 0.10, ns). Both Sobel tests also revealed significant effects (z's &gt; 2.97, p's &lt; 0.01), indicating that the effect 4 Variety did have a marginally significant effect on perceived exclu- sivity in the binocular category, t (74) = 1.83, p = 0.07, but the effect was actually in the opposite direction; perceived exclusivity was higher in the low variety condition (M = 4.81 versus 4.31).</page><page sequence="8">Berger et al.: The Influence of Product Variety on Brand Perception and Choice Marketing Science 26(4), pp. 460-472, ©2007 INFORMS 467 Figure 1 Study 4: Mediational Analyses Notes.

Discussion Study 4 again demonstrated that offering greater variety positively influences brand choice share and perceived brand quality. There was also no corre- sponding effect of variety on measures we did not expect it to influence: price and exclusivity. Further- more, the results support our analysis regarding the mechanism underlying these effects, showing that the impact of brand variety on choice is mediated by quality perceptions, and that the impact of variety on quality perceptions is mediated by brand expertise. Study 5: The Moderating Role of the Ability to Infer Quality Though Studies 1-4 demonstrate a robust positive effect of product variety on brand choice and per- ceived quality, one would not expect this effect to hold under all conditions, and it might even reverse in some situations. Thus Studies 5 and 6 examine some important boundary conditions for this effect. The proposition that variety influences choice through its impact on perceived quality implies that the ability to infer quality differences from the offered variety is essential for the variety-brand quality and hence variety-brand choice link. The distinction can be made between produced variety, i.e., the set of options produced by the brand, and offered variety, or the particular set of produced options that happens to be available in a given shopping context. In the first four studies, participants were told that all the options made by the brand were in front of them, and thus offered variety equaled produced variety and partici- pants could form inferences about brand quality from the variety offered. In contrast, if the offered variety is less informative about produced variety, then it should be harder for consumers to infer brand quality from the variety offered, and the impact of variety on brand choice share should be reduced or eliminated. Study 5 examines this prediction. Similar to Study 1, participants were shown choco- lates sold by two chocolate brands, offering smaller or larger variety, and asked to select a chocolate from one of the brands. We also manipulated the abil- ity to infer brand quality differences from variety: half the participants were informed that the choco- lates displayed were the complete product assort- ment each brand offered ("complete" assortment condition), while the other half were told the dis- played products were the chocolates that were avail- able at the time ("partial" assortment condition). We expected that the ability to infer quality differences from variety would be greater in the former condi- tion, leading to stronger effect of assortment size on brand choice. Method Respondents (N = 70) were paid three dollars to par- ticipate in a choice study. They sat next to a round table on which the product offerings of two chocolate brands were displayed. Brand names, descriptions, and counterbalancing were identical to those used in Study 1. Participants were randomly assigned to condition. In the complete assortment [partial assortment] con- dition they were told, "All [Some] of the chocolates offered by each brand appear on the table in front of you. For each brand, the selection provided is the full range [some] of chocolates they offer, that is, all the different options they make [the particular options shown are those that happened to be available in the box size we could purchase]" (italics added). They were then asked to "write down which choco- late you would buy for yourself." After tasting the selected chocolate, they turned the page and rated</page><page sequence="9">Berger et al.: The Influence of Product Variety on Brand Perception and Choice 468 Marketing Science 26(4), pp. 460-472, ©2007 INFORMS the quality of both brands (1 = Low Quality, 9 = High Quality). After completing the study, participants were thanked for their participation and offered the follow- ing gift options: "As a compensation for participating in the study, you can choose to receive either three dollars or a box containing four preselected chocolates from Au Due de Praslin or a box containing four pre- selected chocolates from Arnaud Soubeyran. Which would you prefer?" Boxes of chocolates were visible behind the chocolate display for each brand, and par- ticipants indicated their decision. Results Assortment Effects on Quality Perceptions and Choice. We expected that participants would per- ceive smaller quality differences between the high and low variety brands in the partial than in the com- plete assortment condition. A 2 (Perceived Assort- ment: complete versus partial) x 2 (Variety Offered: Smaller versus Larger) repeated measures ANOVA was performed on brand quality perceptions. Consis- tent with the earlier studies, there was a main effect of Variety Offered (F(l, 67) = 5.44, p &lt; 0.05), indicating that participants rated the chocolate brand offering greater variety as having higher quality (Mlarger variety = 6.96 versus Mealier variety = 6.48). This effect, however, was qualified by a significant Perceived Assortment x Variety Offered interaction (F(l, 67) = 6.14, p &lt; 0.05). As expected, participants perceived a significant qual- ity difference between the brands in the "com- plete" assortment condition (Mlarger variety = 7.11 versus Hmaller variety = 6.11 F(l, 67) = 12.58, V &lt; 0.001) but not in the "partial" assortment condition, (Mlarger variety = 6.84 versus A^maller variety = 6.84, F &lt; 1). We next examined whether the reduced ability to infer quality differences affected brand choice (Fig- ure 2). As expected, participants were more likely to select the brand that offered more options 0f2(l, N = 70) = 14.63, p &lt; 0.01), but this effect was moderated by perceived assortment (^2(1,N = 70) = 4.50, p &lt; 0.05). Specifically, although participants in the com- plete assortment condition were significantly more likely to select an option from the brand that offered greater variety (84%) than the brand that offered less variety (26%), *2(1,N = 37) = 16.89, p &lt; 0.01, the effect was less pronounced and not statistically signif- icant in the partial assortment condition (61% versus 39%, *2(1, N = 33) = 1.48, p &gt; 0.2). Mediational Analysis. Participants were more likely to choose the greater variety brand in the complete assortment condition, but we also exam- ine whether, as we hypothesized, this differences was driven by changes in the difference between quality perceptions of the two brands. Figure 2 Study 4: Influence of Perceived Assortment on Brand Choice As predicted, the influence of perceived assortment on brand choice was fully mediated by difference in quality perceptions between the brands. Perceived assortment was correlated with brand choice (j8 = 0.26, p &lt; 0.03) and was also correlated with differ- ence in quality perceptions between the brands (j8 = 0.28, p &lt; 0.02). However, when both perceived assort- ment and difference in quality perceptions between the brands were simultaneously included in a regres- sion predicting brand choice, difference in quality per- ceptions was a significant predictor (/3 = 0.40, p &lt; 0.001), whereas perceived assortment was not (/3 = 0.15, p &gt; 0.20). The Sobel test also revealed a signifi- cant effect, z = 1.99, p = 0.05, indicating that the effect of perceived assortment on brand choice was fully mediated by the difference in quality perceptions. Actual Purchase. We also tested the effect of brand variety in the partial and complete conditions. Because most participants (76%) preferred the three dollars to chocolates, the effective sample sizes were small. However, selections of those who did choose chocolates paralleled the above brand choice results. That is, participants who selected chocolates over money tended to purchase chocolates from the brand offering greater variety (x2(l,N = 14) = 4.57, p &lt; 0.05). All of the chocolate purchasers in the complete assortment condition chose the brand offering greater variety, compared to only 57% of those in the partial assortment condition (*2(1, N = 14) = 3.82, p = 0.05). Discussion Consistent with our prediction that the effect of vari- ety on brand choice is in part driven by quality inferences, the results of Study 5 demonstrate the moderating impact of the ability to infer quality dif- ferences on the variety-brand choice link. The product variety offered only influenced which brand partici- pants chose when they could use it to infer produced variety and thus form brand quality inferences. Fur- thermore, difference in quality perceptions between the brands fully mediated the relationship between</page><page sequence="10">Berger et al.: The Influence of Product Variety on Brand Perception and Choice Marketing Science 26(4), pp. 460-472, ©2007 INFORMS 469 perceived assortment and brand choice. Finally, the results suggest that inferences based on the product variety offered by a brand can affect actual purchase behavior with real consequences. Study 6: The Moderating Role of Option Set Compatibility Study 5 identified one boundary condition regarding the positive effect of product variety on brand per- ception, indicating that this effect applies only when the observed set of options is informative with respect to the entire variety produced by the brand. Study 6 examines a second boundary condition that relates to the composition of the product variety. Specifi- cally, offering a greater variety of compatible options that reflect a depth of expertise in a particular area (e.g., dark chocolate, mountain bicycles) is expected to have a positive effect on perceived quality. Con- versely, offering a wide variety of what might be seen as incompatible options, such as both Japanese and Chinese food, may signal lack of focus and raise doubts about the quality of the brand's product line. That is, the basic notion of specialization and exper- tise implies doing a few things very well, without try- ing to cover the entire spectrum. Although a company may excel in a wide range of related product types - road and mountain bikes, Japanese and Chinese food, or ice skates and running shoes - consumers are likely to employ a heuristic whereby breadth tends to come at the expense of depth, especially when there is lim- ited information about quality. To test whether the positive effect of product vari- ety on perceived brand quality is eliminated when the variety is less focused, we gave participants informa- tion about the product offerings of different bicycle brands and asked them to rate each brand's quality and category expertise. The brands differed in both the number of options they offered and whether the variety was compatible. We expect that greater prod- uct variety will enhance perceived quality and exper- tise only when the set of options offered by the brand is compatible. Method Sixty-four consumers, who are members of a Web- based subject pool, completed a "Brand Perception Study" in exchange for a chance to win a $20 online gift certificate. They were given information about different bicycle brands and rated each one. Respon- dents were told that a number of bike brands had recently been rated by a cycling magazine and that the experimenters were interested in whether they could predict the overall quality rating given to these brands. The brands differed in both the number of options they offered and whether the variety was compat- ible. Specifically, one brand offered two road bikes (made with different frame materials); a second brand offered the same two road bikes as well as five addi- tional road bikes (compatible high variety); a third brand (incompatible high variety) offered the same two road bikes plus five bikes for different use types, including mountain bikes and city cruisers. Respon- dents were then asked to guess how the magazine rated the quality of each brand (1 = Low Quality, 7 = High Quality). On the next page, they also rated each brand on the same expertise items used in Study 4 (a = 0.88, averaged to form an index). Results Responses were analyzed using a 3 (Variety Offered: Low versus High Compatible versus High Incom- patible) repeated measures ANOVA. We first exam- ined responses on the expertise measure. As expected, the variety offered influenced perceptions of exper- tise (F(2, 20) = 12.98, p &lt; 0.001); however, relative to the low variety condition (M = 4.62) offering greater variety increased perceptions of expertise only when it was compatible (M = 6.15 F(l,21) = 10.98, p &lt; 0.005). When the variety was incompatible, it slightly decreased brand perceptions (M = 4.29 F &lt; 0.5; p &gt; 0.2). Offering increased variety only increased percep- tions of expertise when it was compatible, so we expect offering more options should only increase quality perceptions under those conditions. Consis- tent with this prediction, there was an effect of product variety on quality perceptions (F(2, 20) = 15.78, p &lt; 0.001), but greater variety only enhanced quality perceptions when the set of options was focused (M = 6.27 versus 4.82, F(l,21) = 13.31, p &lt; 0.005). When the options offered were unfo- cused, offering more variety slightly decreased qual- ity perceptions (M = 4.05 versus 4.82, F(l, 21) = 3.21, p = 0.09). Discussion Results of Study 6 demonstrate an important bound- ary condition: The positive effect of greater product variety is observed only when the options are com- patible, representing category expertise. A follow-up study extended these findings using a between- subject design. Participants in that study rated the quality of a restaurant that offered either low vari- ety (i.e., a few Thai food options), greater compatible variety (the same options plus five other Thai food options), or greater incompatible variety (i.e., a few Thai options plus five non-Thai options, such as egg rolls). Replicating the results of Study 6, participants perceived the brand more favorably (both in terms of expertise and quality) only when the options included in the expanded set were compatible.</page><page sequence="11">Berger et al.: The Influence of Product Variety on Brand Perception and Choice 470 Marketing Science 26(4), pp. 460-472, ©2007 INFORMS General Discussion The number of product variants offered by a firm in a category is a key marketing mix variable. Recent research has provided evidence for both the bene- fits and downsides of offering greater product vari- ety. On the one hand, more options allow the firm to offer a better match to varied customer tastes and segments. However, offering more options can also be frustrating and demotivating (e.g., Chernev 2003a, 2003b; Iyengar and Lepper 2000), leading to deci- sion deferral. The present research suggests a separate route through which the variety offered may influence which brand consumers choose: brand quality infer- ences. The present research is particularly relevant to common situations in which the relevant question is which brand a consumer will choose, rather than whether a choice from a given set of options will be made. In this section, we review the key findings and discuss their theoretical and practical implications. Summary of Findings The present research demonstrates a robust effect of compatible product variety on brand quality per- ceptions and brand choice, even when the effective option set is held constant. The evidence indicates that product variety influences perceived brand qual- ity both when evaluating a single brand (Studies 2-4) and when choosing between brands (Study 1 and 5). This effect is observed despite the fact that variety makes the act of choice itself more difficult and frus- trating (Study 2). In addition, the effect of product variety on perceived quality and on a concrete dimen- sion such as taste persists even after consumers expe- rience the product (Studies 1-3 and 5), suggesting that product variety can also enhance repeat purchase rate. The influence of product variety on brand choice mir- rors its effect on quality perceptions, which, in turn, is mediated by the effect of variety on perceived brand category expertise (Study 4). We identified two boundary conditions regarding the effects of product variety. First, consistent with our analysis, the positive effects of variety occur only when the observed set of options is informative with respect to the entire variety offered by the brand (Study 5). Second, the composition of the product variety, in particular, the degree to which it is seen as compatible and reflecting specialization, is a key mod- erator of the impact of variety on perceived quality (Study 6). In fact, unfocused variety may sometimes backfire and negatively affect perceptions of expertise in a well-defined product category. Theoretical and Practical Implications Other aspects of the composition of the set of options a brand offers might also moderate the effect of prod- uct variety. For example, unique, exotic flavors, or a particularly high cocoa content chocolate, are likely to have greater impact on perceived quality than more mundane product variants. Even if few consumers actually choose such items, their presence can create a certain aura and enhance the brand's perceived cat- egory expertise (also see Chernev 2005; Gourville and Soman 2005 for ways in which assortment structure can influence choice). Although we have focused on the impact of the number of options, the structure and presentation of the offered product assortment can also affect the brand's perceived quality by influencing the per- ceived product variety (Broniarczyk et al. 1998, Hoch et al. 1999, Kahn and Wansink 2004). Research sug- gests, for example, that large varieties may be harder to see when they are disorganized, whereas disor- ganization may benefit smaller assortments because it obscures the fact that few options are available (Kahn and Wansink 2004). Consequently, brands that offer large assortments might be perceived as higher quality when their assortments are organized, but the opposite might occur for brands that offer fewer options. Future research might investigate additional ways in which the variety of options from which an indi- vidual makes a selection affects the perception of the chosen option. In particular, in addition to influencing perceived quality, the variety offered might affect the perceived fit between the option consumers select and their tastes. Specifically, holding the "true" fit between an option and an individual's (often malleable) tastes constant, the mere fact that an option was selected from a large set of varied options may enhance the perceived match between that option and the consumer's preferences. For example, a strawberry- banana yogurt might be seen as providing a better fit to one's ideal yogurt preference when that option is selected from a set of 60 yogurts than when it is selected from a set of just three yogurts. Future research might also examine the implica- tions of the present findings for recent research that has emphasized the disadvantages of offering large choice sets. This issue can be viewed as reflecting pro- cesses that arise at different stages in the decision process (e.g., Kahn and Lehmann 1991, Sood et al. 2004). Consumers often decide both which brand, or assortment, to choose as well as which option to select from that brand, and these decisions can be made sequentially or simultaneously.5 Too many 5 Of course, one can decompose the decision process based on other dimensions as well. For example, consumers may first select a subtype (e.g., plasma HDTV) and then make a specific choice based on other attributes. However, in the context of this and many other consumer studies, the brand cue is particularly important, because it is reasonable to make inferences about a brand based on its offer- ings, and it thus provides an effective way to decompose the deci- sion process.</page><page sequence="12">Berger et al.: The Influence of Product Variety on Brand Perception and Choice Marketing Science 26(4), pp. 460-472, ©2007 INFORMS 471 options can lead to choice deferral at either stage of the process, and although the variety offered may make the choice from a given assortment more dif- ficult, our findings suggest it can also help simplify the choice between assortments or brands (see also Chernev 2006). Especially in categories where con- sumers have little prior knowledge, they may use the variety brands offer as a heuristic to resolve brand choice. Thus, although larger product variety may enhance choice difficulty, the reliance on sim- ple heuristics, such as "choose the brand offering the greatest variety of options," is likely to increase as well, consistent with the concept of effort-accuracy tradeoffs (e.g., Bettman et al. 1998). Consequently, a brand's decision to offer greater product variety may have the dual impact of both increasing the overall effort necessary to choose and providing a heuristic cue that simplifies at least the choice between brands. Though there are many cases in which consumers are unwilling to defer choice, for the cases in which deferral is an option, it would be interesting to exam- ine the conditions under which offering more variety has an overall positive effect. The present research did not force consumers to make a choice, but it also did not explicitly provide the option to defer choice. Future research might examine how the variety a brand offers influences the overall choice likelihood. One might expect that offering variety may be like a common dilemma, where it is better for each individ- ual brand to offer more options, but each additional offering hurts overall customer satisfaction with their choice from the category and increases the likelihood of choice deferral. Though prior research has discussed how supply and demand considerations influence the optimal product line breadth (e.g., Draganska and Jain 2005, Kekre and Srinivasan 1990), our research suggests marketers should also consider the potential benefits of greater variety with respect to consumers' brand perceptions. A typical line extension decision involves estimating market share gained from serving more consumers and comparing it to the production costs (e.g., product design, development, and manufactur- ing) as well as possible cannibalization of existing sales. Such a decision is usually focused on the partic- ular option to be added: Does the market share gained from offering that option outweigh the costs of pro- ducing it? Our findings, however, suggest that it is also important to consider the broader impact of offer- ing greater product variety; offering more options can enhance the perceived quality of the entire line and the brand, more generally. In summary, the present research adds to the exist- ing evidence regarding the impact of product assort- ments on consumer preferences (e.g., Simonson 1999), but going beyond prior research, it indicates that the size of a brand's assortment can be a potent quality cue. Thus, marketers will be well advised to consider and try to measure both the direct and indirect con- tribution of individual products to consumers' per- ception of the product line and likelihood of brand choice.
