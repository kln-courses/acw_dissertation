Halifax: Nova Scotia College of Art and Design Press, 200c. 240 pp., 300 b/w ills. $cc paper. Donald Judd's five hundred exhibition reviews, collected in the recently repub lished Complete Writings, 1959?1975, make up the sort of "messy" art history he endorsed (ici). Some of Judd's preferences contradict today's incipient canon of mid-twentieth century art. He insisted that Al Jensen "is great[,] one of the best painters in the United States" (8c) and also complimented works by Sally Hazelet Drummond, ?yvind Fahlstr?m, Edward Higgins, George Ortman, and others who don't show up in the post war survey texts. In the course of sixteen years Judd sometimes changed his mind. His opinion of work by John Chamberlain (10, 46) and Roy Lichtenstein (48, 100) improved, while his appreciation of Jasper Johns's (14, 89) and Robert Rauschenberg's (42, 106) art deteriorated. Judd's Complete Writings, 1959- 197s offers the reader many other trajectories for reconstructing how a major artist and critic saw art and the world. One thread, Judd's politics, has already provoked much polemical commentary. Another, Judd's concept of phenomena, remains almost unknown. Political anarchism undergirds Judd's later writings. He championed voluntary cooperation among individuals, as well as local control against vast bodies like corpo rations and federal governments, which he believed oppressive by nature. Unlike his cautious statement in "The Artist and Politics: A Symposium" from five years earlier, Judd made rash and incendiary claims in his 197c article "Imperialism, Nationalism and Regionalism": Since it takes a couple of hundred years to make true patriots and since India and China will have to fight it out with Russia and the United States and then a couple of new amalgamations and then since India and China will have to fight, it's easy to see that nationalism will last a thousand years. And, as with the European religious wars, it will be hard to understand what it was all about. It will just have happened and millions, maybe billions will be dead (220).' Sardonic playfulness and rhetorical pos turing hinder serious evaluation. The super ficial fact that India, China, Russia, and the United States are sovereign nations does not preordain war. Judd's dire predictions ignore the intricacies of diplomacy, foreign policy, and world history. In his defense, however, perpetual violence between global super powers may have seemed inevitable six months after the fall of Saigon and amid the continuing cold war. The personal context of Judd's antigovernment stance is also intrigu ing (and not intended as a cheap shot) : his was a privileged anarchism, afforded b)rde Menil philanthropy, his own financial suc cess, and, perhaps most of all, a thirty-four thousand-acre ranch in desolate West Texas. Judd had the means necessary to withdraw from society. Unconvincing to those not already sympathetic, Judd's anarchist positions never theless remain an art-historical fact. Some scholars' veiled or outright accusations of bellicose art criticism, reactionary politics, and misogyny do not adequately account for how Judd exercised his beliefs.2 He contributed articles, posters, and prints to groups like Artists Against the Expressway, Citizens for Local Democracy, the Lower Manhattan Township newspaper, and the War Resisters League (202-07, 217-19).3 He sat on the school board in Marfa, Texas. Activism does not trump the former charges, of course, but historians should consider all facets of Judd's art making and citizenship before passing judgment. Judd argued as much when, tellingly confrontational, he complained in "Imperialism, Nationalism and Regionalism" that a lot of people, elsewhere and in New York, are being very careless and igno rant in their accusations.... I don't like being lectured by doctrinaire artists, who are fortifying their work with poli tics, about situations I've lived with all my life and learned about angrily detail by detail (221-22). Passages like this suggest a tense New York art world in 1975. Judd and other so called Minimalists had to defend their art, politics, and success?a scenario very differ ent from ten years earlier when their objects connoted artistic and political radicalism. Judd's irritation at this shift simmers in the final essays collected here, and he may have had a point. Given his bitter opposition to the Vietnam War and the United States gov ernment?subversive views shared in part with feminists, civil rights activists, and Marxists?methodological critiques of Judd's art and writing warrant care. Judd's art criticism in Complete Writings, 1959-1975 tends to be more tempered and meticulous than his political analysis. A lexicon develops. He argued that art whose forms, colors, surfaces, and other "aspects" were "specific" and "polarized"?that is, autonomous rather than mutually dependent or derivative?was most "interesting" (187).4 Judd thought that most objects in the world are not interesting, in that they are not wor thy of intense looking and thinking. Good art is. It requires and rewards the hypersen sitive perception that interest prompts. According to this aesthetic and critical framework based on specificity and interest, Judd named Josef Albers and Larry Poons among the best contemporary artists. Their works' multiple aspects jarred, since at odds or incommensurable.5 In Albers's Homagefs] to the Square, the varying widths of the bands? widest at top, narrower along both sides, and narrowest at bottom?demonstrated "a hierarchy of scale and a range of close colors and values. The proximity and the extent of a color change the scale of an area, the type of contrast and the color itself" (6). Complica tions multiplied. Judd broadened his analysis beyond scale, hue, and value in noting how I 3 I art journal</page><page sequence="2">the "unbounded color and the final disparity [of each colored band] belie the apparent rigidity of the geometry and provide the central lyric and exultant ambiguity of the painting" (6).These works' specific aspects, their "rigid geometry" and "unbounded color," approached contradiction without compromising one another?and this made for multifaceted, interesting art. Poons's paintings were similarly manifold. Judd studied the "definite" polka dots, then their "transitory" afterimages, both one by one and as a "whole pattern"; next he consid ered the dots' "sparse and somewhat casual and accidental, and yet seemingly con trolled" arrangement; finally, he interpreted wider philosophical propositions in the paintings' contrasting "senses of order, relative order and chance" (154-55, 174). Definite but transitory; accidental while controlled; ordered yet up to chance. For Judd, specificity entailed multiplicity. Ostensibly absent in his own objects, external references in others' art did not always draw Judd's disapproval. As long as this kind of meaning stayed specific and separate from other aspects, he liked the additional layer of complexity. Judd praised the connotations of sex and war he read in Lee Bontecou's constructions (65, 179) and the extreme anthropomorphism of Claes Oldenburg's A Bedroom Ensemble (189, 191 ).6 Illusionistic space, however, remained too aesthetically and morally corrupt for con temporary art in Judd's opinion (72). Even so, he knew flatness was risky. Giving up illusionism, in painting or in sculpture, meant disavowing an entire category of sig nificance, no matter how false 1960s artists and critics thought it. To preserve complex ity and sustain interest without illusionism, Judd recognized "a need for something complicated and ambiguous but, unlike imitated space, actual and definite" (154). Bontecou's metaphor and Oldenburg's anthropomorphism were two ways to fill the void. Another possibility was using "color and optical phenomena" (154). Defining phenomena is tricky. Judd wasn't thinking of phenomenology, since Edmund Husserl's and Maurice Merleau Ponty 's metaphysical accounts of perception violated his rigorous positivism. Instead, Judd seems to have meant real illusions that everyone sees, like "absolutely objective" retinal afterimages and other "perfectly matter-of-fact illusion [s]."7 Albers's paint ings have phenomena?instances of "one color altering another" (83). Homage to the Square: At Sea B 1964 has a central square of "more or less zinc yellow," then a band of "light-yellow-green gray," then a band of "light gray" (142). Judd described how the inner yellow makes the surrounding light yellow-green gray appear simply gray. The outermost light gray seems yellow-green. The center changes too. These illusions fit his criteria?complicated and ambiguous but actual and definite. Specific phenomena parallel specific objects in Complete Writings, 1959-1975.8 For example, Judd differentiated his own art from Dan Flavin's: "I want a particular, defi nite object. I think Flavin wants, at least first or primarily, a particular phenomenon" (200).The intense optical effects of Flavin's fluorescent lamps recalled and exceeded illusions in Albers's paintings: two outside tubes are cool white and the inner ones are daylight white, which looks blue in this context. A line of light is thrown along each tube by the adja cent ones. The space between the two central tubes is blue, bluer than the bulbs. The two other spaces are less blue because of the white ( 124). Judd identified these illusions, along with the lamps' arrangement and their light's diffusion in actual space, as three specific aspects of Flavin's phenomenal artwork (200). Before his catalogue essay on Flavin, Judd made striking assertions about phe nomena in the March 1965 Arts Magazine. Reviewing work by European artists Gerald Oster and Karl Gerstner, he contended, "Oil paint and description are at least obsoles cent. Obviously the old painting is being replaced by the use of specific materials, forms and phenomena" (169). Despite impending obsolescence, Judd felt the best contemporary oil paintings still surpassed the new phenomenal works. Oster and Gerstner had not yet mastered their medi um: "The use of this kind of phenomena, the way in which it will be good art, is going to be one of the big problems" (169). But Judd saw great potential: "Something may be done with the phenomenon which will replace present art" and "start . . . what will be an important kind of art" (166). In 1969, when Judd wrote on Flavin, phenome nal art was maturing. Two decades later, Judd still thought that "the future of art lies in stressing phenomena more, but you can also make too much ofthat."9 The stakes are high, Judd's reserve notwithstanding. Tracing phenomena pro vides a new way to historicize Judd's art and criticism and perhaps that of other contem poraneous artists. If, as in Judd's Complete Writings, 1959-1975, phenomena comprise an integral aspect of the best 1960s art, his torical analysis has to catch up. Instead of Post-Minimalism or Conceptualism, the most intimate successor of Minimalism may be the Light &amp; Space movement of Southern California, which investigaged the phenom enal above all else.10 Focus veers from New York to Los Angeles and artists like Peter Alexander, Larry Bell, Robert Irwin, Craig Kauffman, John McCracken, and De Wain Valentine. " Mid-twentieth-century American art begins to look a lot different. Bell's and Irwin 's art culminates Judd's writing on phenomena. In a 1993 talk, Judd said that "color is an immediate sensation, a phenomenon, and in that leads to the work of Flavin, Bell and Irwin."12 Contrary to what one expects from these three artists' specific objects, structural clarity does not restrict phenomena like color. The two polarized aspects coexist. And this goes for Judd as well. His one hundred untitled works in mill aluminum are as much visual phenomena as discreet forms. '3 Changes in light from the time of day and local weather tint the boxes as they dematerialize in ricocheting reflec tions. If we have overlooked phenomena in Judd's art and criticism all along, the same may hold true for the specific objects of other mid-twentieth-century artists. The new reprint of Complete Writings, 1959-1975 will help resolve or restore this ambiguity. Adrian Kohn is a doctoral candidate at the University of Texas.
