Coyne, SJ* Introduction Ever to the be since threat through Charles that a such natural Darwin a scientific process first proposed of explanation evolution that a might all debate life pose forms has for raged have religious about come to be through a natural process of evolution a debate has raged about the threat that such a scientific explanation might pose for religious belief. This has had its effect in different ways upon all religious congregations from the most fundamental to the most liberal. Within the past decade there has grown a movement which goes commonly by the name of the Intelligent Design Movement (IDM). Its fundamental claim is that there are living organisms which are so complex that they could not have emerged through evolution but must have been designed by an intelligent being. This obviously presents us with a direct and basic confrontation between science and religion. The life sciences seek to explain all living beings through natural processes and claim that any explanation such as intelligent design lies outside of science. The IDM presents itself as science and yet it certainly appears, with its appeal to an intelligent designer, to be a religious movement. What does a scientist who is a religious believer think of this confrontation? Religion meets science Why does there persist within religious culture a notion that evolution as a scientific explanation of the origins of living beings is atheistic? Biological evolution in a particular way has been the enigma of religions. Fundamentalist religious thought denies it. Catholic thought, as it has matured, accepts it as scientifically the best explanation we have but hesitates in how to deal with it. * Vatican Observatory.

Is it because God must be omnipotent and have everything under his control? The dynamism intrinsic in the universe in evolution seems to escape this omnipotence. There appears to exist a nagging fear in the Churches that a universe, which science has established as evolving for 13.7 billion years since the Big Bang and in which life, beginning in its most primitive forms at about 12 billion years from the Big Bang, evolved through a process of random genetic mutations and natural selection, escapes Gods dominion. That fear is groundless. Science is completely neutral with respect to philosophical or theological implications that may be drawn from its conclusions. Those conclusions are always subject to improvement. But for someone to deny the best of today s science on religious grounds or to substitute religion for science is to live in that groundless fear just mentioned. What does science do? Let us look at this confrontation more closely. First we ask: what does science try to do? A fundamental tenet of the sciences is to seek for natural causes for natural phenomena. When these natural causes are found, science has succeeded. When they are not yet found, scientists continue to search but they will not allow that it is necessary to seek for a cause outside nature, an intelligent designer, a "God of the gaps." History has shown, since the time of Isaac Newton, that the "God of the gaps" eventually surrenders to a natural explanation. Newton, for instance, argued from the universal law of gravity which he discovered that nature exhibits a number of mechanical phenomena for which no scientific explanation could be found. He, therefore, constructed an argument for the existence of God whose direct intervention would explain the gaps in the scientific discourse. But this manner of reasoning made Newton s argument for God extremely vulnerable. His argument would clearly lose its strength at the moment when a scientific explanation was actually found. In the beginning of the 19th century the work of Laplace found just such an explanation within Newtonian mechanics itself. The gap that Newtons God had filled no longer existed. So out went God! This is the background of the popular anecdote of Laplace replying to Napoleon, when the Emperor asked him why God did not figure in his Mécanique céleste : "Sir, I have no need of that hypothesis." Evolution is science at work The great achievement of Charles Darwin was precisely to bring the study of life into the ambit of the sciences already well established in physics and chemistry.

What is Science and What is Not 719 a scientific study which attempted to explain all natural living phenomena by natural causes. And the attempt is just that: an attempt. And it has to our day had immense success. To date there is no other scientific explanation that rivals that whereby all living beings, including ourselves, come about by chance mutations in the original being which result in stepwise changes in the products carried out by natural selection in the environment in which the products come to exist. Those products survive which can best adapt to their environment. There is, therefore, an apparent destiny towards more perfect beings, i.e. better able to adapt, in this process; but the apparent destiny can be explained by the natural process itself. Needless to say, we do not yet know the natural processes whereby life first came to be. But science, as such, will always find recourse to non-natural causes unnecessary. And that recourse is exactly what IDM tries to accomplish. But every case of a biological system that IDM has proposed as requiring intelligent design has failed. A natural explanation within evolutionary biology has been found. This holds for the flagellum, the cilium and the blood clotting cascade in vertebrates, all of which have been claimed to require intelligent design. The fallacy here is the failure to accept what is at the heart of neo- Darwinian evolution, namely, that by a step-by-step process of mutations and adaption though natural selection an organism, which is the result of former mutations and adaptations and which has a certain function before mutating and adapting again, can have another function afterwards and can, in fact, be integrated into a more complex organism of which it now constitutes a part. Evolution is a creative process. The claim of intelligent design that there are complex systems which could not function unless all of their parts were assembled at the same time according to a design is, as far as science goes, wrong. At least no such system has been yet proposed which passes the test of requiring a non-natural explanation such as intelligent design. Reflections upon the God of Evolution Intelligent design is seen by most scientists, and has thus far been judged by the judicial system in the United States, to have a hidden religious agenda and a fundamentalist inspiration at that. Whether this is true or not, one might examine the influence of the intelligent design movement upon religious belief. While IDM claims that their designer is not necessarily the God of religious faith, it is difficult to imagine whom it might be. At any rate, according to IDM, at the heart of life in the universe is placed a designer. This belittles the God of religious faith by making him one who plans or assigns his minions to plan every step in the coming to be of life in the universe and in its evolution. This is far from the God who has truly revealed himself in the universe he created. Both cosmological and biological evolution reveal a God Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia Vol. 66 - Fase. 4 • 2010</page><page sequence="4">720 George V. Coyne, SI who made a universe that has within it through evolution a certain dynamism and thus participates in the very creativity of God. If they respect the results of modern science, religious believers must move away from the notion of a dictator God, a Newtonian God of the gaps, a designer God who made the universe as a watch that ticks along regularly. Perhaps God should be seen more as a parent. Scripture is very rich in this thought. It presents, indeed in an anthropomorphic way, a God who gets angry, who disciplines, a God who nurtures the universe. God is working with the universe. The universe, through evolution, has a certain vitality of its own like a child does. You discipline a child but you try to preserve and enrich the individual character of the child and its own passion for life. A parent must allow the child to grow into adulthood, to come to make its own choices, to go on its own way in life. In such wise does God deal with the universe. These are very weak images, but how else do we talk about God. We can only come to know God by analogy. The universe as we know it today through science is one way to derive analogical knowledge of God. For those who believe modern science does say something to us about God, it provides a challenge, an enriching challenge, to traditional beliefs about God. But there is always the temptation in this reasoning to make God into our own image and likeness. This would be idolatry. And I am afraid that the IDM intelligent design movement has unwittingly fallen into this idolatry by making God or his minions designers. "God is love and anyone who lives in God lives in love and God lives in him" (First Epistle of St. John, 4:16). To me the evolutionary universe reveals just such a God and not a designer. Why should it not? After all He created it. Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia Vol. 66 - Fase. 4 • 2010</page></plain_text>
