<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Theories of Welfare Economics, Hla Myint. Cambridge: Harvard University Press (for the London School of Economics and Political Science), 1948. Pp. xiv, 240. $4.00. This book does more than its title suggests. It contains both a clear, concise summary of modern welfare economics and a refresh- ingly accurate interpretation of classical economics. It is a history of economic thought that rightly devotes more than half its pages to the period since John Stuart Mill. It defines welfare economics at once so broadly as to include the main body of all economic theory, and so narrowly as to exclude (because it involves unscientific interpersonal comparisons of utility) the problem of the distribution of personal incomes. The book is a critical summary of each major theoretical system that deals with increasing welfare through production and exchange. In Part I, "Physical Level," Professor Myint views the classical writers. Their primary concern was not the allocation of given resources (this view is a "theoretical anthropomorphism" of the modern day), but increasing the total physical output by raising the physical productivity of labor and expanding the total volume of economic activity. Hence their dynamic laws of population and capital accumulation. Free Competition was intended to promote dynamic expansion by giving free rein to individual initiative (quite different from today's pure and perfect competition, intended to secure allocative efficiency). The great controversy between Malthus and the Ricardians over the balance of production and consumption here assumes its right- ful place. Professor Myint has a brilliant analysis of the measure of value problem. This neglected element in classical economics was an integral part of the Glut controversy. Keynes' measurement of the national income in wage-units is, after all, the equivalent of Malthus' use of labor commanded. Second only to this as a specific contribution is his sympathetic interpretation of Productive Labour. On details of interpretation there are bound to be differences of opinion. Not seeking a typical case, let me pause with Malthus. Professor Myint's generally excellent treatment is based on the second edition of Malthus' Principles. Reference to the first edition would have shown that Malthus' use of the intensity of demand was independent of (and prior to) Senior's "path-breaking work" on marginal utility (cf. Myint, p. 36). Furthermore, Malthus' Measure 753</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS of Value (1823) shows that the distinction between "extrinsic" and "intrinsic" value was not borrowed from Senior. Only the labels were borrowed (cf. Myint, p. 38). Again, Malthus' emphasis on the "intensity of demand" did not reduce entirely to purchasing power, for he stressed the will as well as the power to purchase, and empha- sized that the maintenance of effective demand required that the commodities produced be suited to the tastes of consumers (cf. Myint, pp. 37-38, 64). Part II, "Subjective Level," concerns the marginalist writers. Allocation of resources, in the full sense of adaptation of prod- ucts to consumers' wants, is now the dominant theme. Dimin- ishing marginal utility or substitutability replaces the assumption that quantities of welfare are roughly proportional to quantities of physical products, while given resources are assumed rather than augmentable ones. There are excellent brief summaries of the General Equilibrium school, with their general optimum defined in terms of equality between subjective and technical marginal rates of substitution, and the English Neo-classical school, with their stress on exceptions to the principle of competition and their techniques of surplus analysis and comparison of marginal social product with marginal private product. Each type of analysis has its place, Professor Myint feels, but the surplus analysis promises most for practical use. Part III, "Ethical Level," considers those criticisms of con- ventional theory that object to its assumption of constant wants. Yet conventional theory remains useful, Professor Myint believes: consumers' demand is relatively stable at any given moment of time and scientific impartiality must be sought. However, the broader problems of general social welfare on the ethical level can- not be ignored. We must make value judgments when dealing with practical social policy, but we should do it consciously and deliber- ately. VICTOR E. SMITH Michigan State College Grass Silage and Dairying, Ray W.
