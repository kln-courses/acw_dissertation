ANTHROPOLOGY, —The De Luna Expedition and the "buzzard cult" in the Southeast.1 James Β. Griffin, For a great many years American arche ologists have been puzzled by a series of re semblances between the Southeastern United States Middle Mississippi cultures and those of the Mexican area, and a con siderable amount of time and speculation has been devoted to either explaining the relationship or explaining it away. (Holmes, 1883, was one of the best early studies.) Prominent among these connections has been a series of drawings of dancing figures and other anthropomorphic concepts, placed on shell and pottery, and figures cut out and impressed in copper. By some stu dents these were interpreted as direct Mexi can influence that came into the Southeast as the result of a migration (Radin, 1927, pp. 192-202; Nuttall, 1932, pp. 137-144) and produced the Middle Mississippi cul ture. Others considered these art styles to be the result of some inherent quality in the Indian mind which at a given cultural level would produce similar "Indian art" styles 1 Read before Society for American Archeology, Washington, May 13, 1944.

De Luna wished to take the bulk of the able bodied and set up a base at Coosa, but his men refused to follow him, and from September, 1560, to April, 1561, the remainder of the expedition struggled along in Pensacola Bay while the majority of the group sent to Coosa evidently re mained there. De Luna's successor, Villa fane, had been ordered to establish the base on the southeast Atlantic coast, and in April 1561, he took with him such members of the De Luna Expedition as still had stom ach for pioneering. The official records do not pay much attention to the fate of the Indians taken on the expedition or say how many were left in Alabama, returned to Mexico, or perished in the Southeast. The Indians had been taken along as "C. B." battalions or engineers to build settlements, repair broken equipment, and to undertake all the disagreeable but fun damental tasks that the Spanish were too busy to do for themselves. De Soto had taken Indian women from Coosa and they spent almost 20 years in Mexico. They re turned to Coosa with Sauz's party. Thus, for almost two years there was a large group of Mexican Indians from the specific areas where the most profound resemblances to the southeastern late art styles are located, and they were in an area that is quite close to a heavy concentration of objects at tributed to Mexican influence.6 First of these sites is Moundville located on the Black Warrior River, a short distance south of Tuscaloosa, Ala., and which is fairly close to the probable location of the Na pochie towns. The other prominent center of Mexicanlike material is at Etowah in Barlow County, Ga., in the headwaters of the Coosa. Both Moundville and Etowah are believed to belong to the later prehis toric archeological period and have been tentatively dated by archeologists at about 1550-1650. On the basis of the archeological 6 Ekholm, 1944, pp. 443-444. The reference to "Etowah" should read Moundville. The re semblances between the skull, heart, and long bones on Moundville vases and those in the Mexican Codices is reported in Moore, 1905. This was not mentioned by Phillips, nor was I aware of it at the Round Table Conference. This re semblance was noted by Caso. data there is little doubt that they were oc cupied contemporaneously during at least part of their existence, for some of the pot tery from Etowah was almost certainly in spired by or directly derived from Mound ville, and pipes of the distinctive late North Georgia style have been found at Mound ville. Another center where shell objects, suggesting Mexican origin, have been found is around Montgomery. Another major cen ter for the shell disks is in eastern Ter.nes see. There have been some theories about the passage along the gulf coast of migratory groups, either by land or by boat, who then moved up the Mississippi and established a center of Middle Mississippi culture. Some such explanation may later be demon strated for earlier elements of either Middle Mississippi or Hopewellian, but the distri butional features of the buzzard-cult arti facts indicates that there was no significant use of such concepts in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, or southern Mississippi. There is one famous site that has a considerable amount of material of this nature, namely, Spiro in the Arkansas Valley of eastern Oklahoma, and that question will be dealt with in another paper. Unfortunately, European-manufactured objects, or items brought into the Southeast from Mexico, have been rarely identified as of this 1560 period. The sole exception known to me so far is a coin and other non Indian material found by Moore with a burial under a pottery vessel in a mound at Bear Point in Perdido Bay. This was a Mexican silver coin of the 1525-1550 period (Moore, 1901, pp. 423-432). Since the ves sel belongs in the Fort Walton period, some of our ideas about cultural chronology in the lower Southeast may be in for a change, depending upon the date at which the coin was deposited. It would seem reasonable that either at Nanipacana or at Coosa some item of Spanish origin would be associated with Indian artifacts so that cross dating might be effected. Many items of European origin have been recovered in the Montgom ery area, but the majority of these are evi dently of the 1680-1750 period, and the same holds true for the trade goods in com parable sites on the Tennessee.</page><page sequence="5">Sept. 15, 1944 clark: a new fossil comatulid 303 It is, therefore, the purpose of this paper to suggest that the De Luna Expedition might well have furnished the impetus that resulted in the adoption in the southeast of various Mexican art styles and concepts. An intensive and considerable amount of re search, however, is needed to analyze and compare the various representations in the Southeast and to examine the Mexican records to see the degree of resemblance to the culture of the area from which the De Luna Expedition in 1559 obtained their In dians.
