<plain_text><page sequence="1">BERNARDO COLOMBO HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES Every political trend involving the procreation sphere, in which the free exercise of individual choices assumes particularly delicate aspects, inevitably arouses ethical as well as social problems. And on these problems the discussionis open. The 1USSP very opportunely dedicated the closing session at the Confer? ence held at Mexico City from 6th to 13th August last to tKis subject and entrusted the writing of the papers to Simone Veil and Bernardo Colombo. The text by Co? lombo will appear in French in the Conference Proceedings. With the kind permis? sion of the Author and the IUSSP, we have published the English version here in order to provoke discussion on the subject and in the convinction of the interest that it will arouse among the readers of the Review. In effect, the Author has tackled the difficult subject by interpreting the invitation to treat it not as ?a suggestion simply to survey present-day and emerg? ing situations but the expectation of a personal*effort to deepen knowledge and makingproposals?, in awareness that this implied a prior ideological choice. Furthermore it appears to us that a more extensive study of the problems can arise from the discussion between scholars who have made different ideological choices and that alternative proposals can result, apart from the theoretical debate, from the analysis of historically differentiated situations. We hope that the Review's invitation will have an adequate echo, also because it seems to us that it is the scientists9 duty to take a responsible share in political decisions. The Editor Ogni orientamento di politica che investe la sfera defla procreazione, nella quale il libero esercizio delle scelte individuali assume aspetti particolarmente deli cati, sdlleva necessariamente problemi etici, oltre che sociali.

Ci sembra peraltro che un ulteriore approfondimento dei problemi possa risultare proprio dalla discussione tra studiosi che abbiano fatto scelte ideologiche diverse e che proposte alternative possano scaturire, oltre che dal dibattito teorico, anche da un'analisi di situazioni storicamente.differenziate. Ci auguriamo che Vinvito della Rivista trovi un'eco adeguata anche perche ci sembra doveroso proprio da parte degli scienziati una responsabile partecipazione alle scelte politiche. La Direzione Toute orientation de politique qui concerne la sphere de la procreation, dans laquelle le libre exercice des choix individuels revet des aspects particuliere ment delicats, souleve necessairement des problemes ethiques ainsi que sociaux.

Nous souhaiions que Vinvitation de la Revue ait un large echo, d'autant plus qu 'une participation responsable aux choix politiques, de la part des hommes de science, nous semble indispensable. La Direction</page><page sequence="3">3 From the moment in which I accepted, or rather received the invitation to give a report on the theme set for this morning, 1 felt and continue to feel my heart shrink. I am not a philosopher in law, or in politics, neither am I an expert on social history; eyen as a demographer, as a result of so many commitments which over the last few years have kept me away from my favourite fields of work, it seems to me I now belong to this particular international community more as an amateur than as a professional. But it has not been so much, or principally, the awareness of these and other personal deficiencies which has kept me in a con? tinuous state of apprehension, but rather an acute sense of inadequacy. The prime source of my embarrassment is in fact the actual theme for discussion. Recently Bernard Berelson, writing about social research in the demogra? phic field, has succinctly summed up the difference between the scholar and the person who deals with political decisions by recalling the saying according to which the first one tries to solve puzzles, the other problems. This also is clearly the case, as it is in general in the social sciences, but here, with the subject of population today, there is something more, in my opinion. Both the scholar and the man of affairs frequently find themselves faced with real-life Vlramas and neither can call on a deus ex machina for an easy solution. 1 must confess to finding myself in the same situation as our President Carmen Miro when she wrote that she did not claim to put herself in the same category as those who have resolved all doubts and thus find themselves already firmly entrenched in fixed positions. I rely on the goodwill of the audience towards someone who, in persistent fog, strains his eyes to keep on the right road. IDEOLOGY It is convenient for me to speak first of all briefly about ideology. This term appeared for the first time at the very end of . the eighteenth century in an academic paper by a French author. But its popularity, and also its usual meaning both in scientific and everyday language, owes a lot above all, it seems to me, to the use Karl Marx made of it. For Karl Marx, to put it extremely briefly, ideology equals inverted and distorted thinking: inverted in so far as you do not realize that it is the reality of the system of production, on which social relationships are superimposed, which gives form and substance to the judicial and political ?super structure?, to religion, art, etc. and not vice versa; distortea because it considers to be universally valid theories things which are simply temporary camouflage for the interests of one class. Today the same term takes on different meanings according to various, sometimes bizarre contexts, as when you come upon an item in a newspaper and read that the ?ideologist? of a band of thieves has been arrested. George Sabine, in his classic treatise on the history of political theory, uses it to denote a body of</page><page sequence="4">4 beliefs, values and convictions which a social group, acting as a unit, must have: a body which reflects the understanding the group has of itself, of its surroundings and of the other social groups with which it interrelates, and which is indeed an es? sential condition for the existence of the group. These beliefs, Sabine goes on to say, range from knowledge into myth and, until they are no longer discussed, seem to be the ?normal? way of thinking and believing of human beings for those who share them. For Marx the word ?ideology ? often takes on a certain pejorative connota? tion, serving to expose the intellectual naivety and bad faith from which superior and enlightened minds are exempt. Even today this debased meaning of the word is widespread. You can see ideology as an all comprehensive view deduced from a limited standpoint which, taken as a whole, involves a deformation and erroneous description of reality. Worse still, however, it is not seen as merely a judgement which leads to action in the social sphere; it also has connotations of intolerance, of aggressiveness and of a desire to impose which expects to bend everyone to the attainment of predetermined goals, of a mind attuned only to power and domina? tion like that of terribles simplificateursQ. Burckhardt)who know everything and have an answer on everything for everyone. For extreme attitudes to violence, including physical violence, a colleague of mine in Padua has used the expression ?sadism of Utopia?. Nothing is more alien to the animus of the scientist. Even the ?truth? he is searching for is cogent to a certain extent. It limits itself, however, to exercising its power over the realm of the intellect: it can fascinate or disappoint, amaze or leave you indifferent, but it does not require your agreement, it does not fetter free-will, which is left entirely self-determining. Again nothing is more foreign to the way in which a scientist works. He does not presume to dominate the minds of others, but on the contrary is concerned as a very minimum with the plausibility of his theories. In addition, according to the limitations set by the subject matter ? severe in the specific case of the social scientist, who, as it often occurs, can only consider a post hoc (after which it is easy for superficially minded people to place an ergo propter hoc) and in the best of cases can make use of only quasi-experi? mental plans ? he concentrates on an empirical check of these same theories. Neither is he satisfied with this, if he is a serious scientist, afraid of being betrayed, so fond is he of his thesis, and adopts along with Karl Popper the criterion of falsifiability as a check on his mental constructions. Aware of the fact that with similar checks you cannot construct a universal law, he remains open to the lesson from an isolated empirical result which by itself suffices to invalidate the alleged universality of the law. Far from being dogmatic, he is always open to being refuted. Yet the creative thinking of the scientist does not originate from a tabula rasa, like a free product, but ? apart from his cultural background and talent ? it is normally directed at and guided by attitudes and cognitive prescientific actions made on the basis of preferences, preconceptions and presuppositions, f can illus</page><page sequence="5">) tr?te the point by making use of an example w hich really applies more to natural sciences, particularly physics, but precisely because of this it underlines the general significance of the statement: ?The (usually unacknowledged) presuppositions per? vading the work of scientists ? Gerard Holton said recently at the 5th Internation? al Symposium of the Smithsonian Institution, commemorating the 500th Anniver? sary of the birth of Copernicus ? have long included such thematic preconceptions as these: simplicity, order and symmetry; the primacy of experience versus that of symbolic formalism; reductionism versus holism; discontinuity versus the con? tinuum; hierarchical structure versus unity; the animate versus the inanimate; the use of mechanism versus teological or anthropomorphic modes of approach? (1). Joseph Schumpeter was thinking along the same lines ? and with him we are in the field of social sciences ? when he concluded his report at the 61st An? nual Meeting of the American Economic Association by recognizing the importance of a cognitive prescientific action rising from ideologies, as a necessary condition for scientific work: ?No new departure in any science is possible without it. Through it we acquire new material for our scientific endeavors and something to formulate, to defend, to attack. Our stock of facts and tools grows and rejuvenates itself in the process. And so ? though we proceed slowly because of our ideologies, we might not proceed at all without them? (2). But one can go further than this. Unlike the significant role played by the ?magi? in the intellectual life of the Renaissance, Owen Gingerich ? at the Symposium quoted ? has noted how science today is far more exclusive: ?Magic and love, music, poetry, and religion all lie out? side its bounds; but that is not to say that science encompasses all that there is to know, for such intimations can only alienate some of the most creative spirits among us?. And in the discussion at the same session, Werner Heisenberg was emphatic in asserting that ?... rationalism alone, so far as I can see, is not suffi? cient to establish a sound basis of a social community. This is simply because, when you go to rational arguments, they always lead from assumptions to results, but you can never prove whether the assumption is right?. This succession of quotations leads me to a conclusion. It has-been seen that ideology is the expression of a group. In addition to this, in the social field in its stress on praxis it encompasses a system of values, a judgement on what is good and bad, a singling-out and ordering of goals: in brief, it seems like an act of faith which demands as much from the intellect as from the will, lives on experience as well as on forecasts and hopes, it is a Weltanschauung, an insight into the meaning of life and the world. When 1 observe that from different posi? tions believers in various religions and ?secularists? appealing to ?humanitarian)) considerations, the man in the street and followers of schools of philosophy, all (1) 0.

Vol. 39, n. 2, 1949.</page><page sequence="6">6 converge in affirming ? and agreeing on ? the existence of basic human rights. I like to see in this a peephole uncovered and a glimmer caught of that truth towards which everyone is moving. HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE UNITED NATIONS SYSTEM To give concrete recognition to human, or fundamental, or essential rights or however you wish to call them, naturally constitutes a political act. With this we come down from abstract ideas, from theory, and move towards observance, putting into practice, guarantee and defence. Usually such recognition is written into constitutional statutes, but here is certainly not the time to make comparisons, which, besides, would go well beyond my powers. Rather, the recent status and the assertion of the idea of basic human rights in international documents or, better, in some of these which seem more interesting because of the train of ideas to be dealt with later, deserve a moment of reflection. in this respect it is imperative to quote first the United Nations Charter. According to article 56, a State which becomes a member of the Organisation explicitly pledges itself, amongst other things, to work for the universal respect and observance of human rights and of fundamental liberties for everyone. The reference to these rights and liberties right from the preamble of the Charter, with successively repeated reminders, constitutes and important qualitative difference between this and the Statute of the defunct League of Nations. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted and proclaimed on December 10th, 1948 by an almost unanimous vote ? with a few, but significant, abstentions - soon intervened to provide solid contents for the formal wrappings of the synthetic and general terms of the Charter. It took 18 years then for the way to be opened for binding instruments such as the two Covenants adopted on December 16th, 1966, one relating to economic, cultural and social rights, the other concerning the more traditional civil and political rights. The lodging of the ratifications to these by member States went forward relatively slowly, so much so that the goal fixed for their coming into force was only reached about a year and a half ago. At the moment in which I am writing, we are at around forty, almost the same countries for both Covenants; there have only been about thirteen States, how? ever, which have formally agreed to the optional protocol on civil and political rights which empowers the ?Committee for Human Rights? to receive and exam? ine petitions coming from individuals too, and not only those presented by a State. Turning a globe and concerning ourselves only with some of the most important countries, demographi(;ally speaking, without ignoring the others, we realize that acceptance has still to come from France, Nigeria, Brazil, The United States, Indonesia, China, India and Fgypt and finally my own country, which did indeed sign the above mentioned document last year but as yet has ratified nothing.</page><page sequence="7">7 These omissions give us definite proof of the present limited juridical scope of such instruments. Moreover, their nature must be seen as not issuing forth from a universal conception of people as citizens of the world making the first step towards a united form of political organization, it is a question of mere interstate agreements. An absolute value is not given in them to man as such, but only a relative one as the subject of a Sovereign State. Moreover, the fragility of the forms of guarantee drawn up reveal another source of weakness for rights, which, in order to be actually regarded as such in real life, should see their enforcement adequately ensured. Markedly more effective procedures with this goal in mind are only in force or codified in international instruments with regional significance: I am thinking, for example, of the European Convention on Human Rights which came into force in 1953, or of the Pact of San Jose of Costa Rica of 1969 by the Organization of American States. The basic rights which concern us more closely, apart from the frail basis of the Pacts mentioned, also find support today at a world level in a series of declarations, proclamations, recommendations, conventions, plans of actions, etc., which, however, only come into a legal discourse indirectly, deprived as they are of any immediate binding effect on member States. It is true that the repeated reaffirmation of a right in successive documents may tend to give the same a stronger basis, but it may also be an indication of its widespread lack of observance: without taking into account at all the fact that the variants introduced, or aban? doned, in successive formulations are bound to raise more than a few doubts as to their exact meaning. It must be said in this connection that the political setting in which the finishing touches are put to these sorts of documents are among the least suited to producing precise, clear and coherent legal terms. The text drawn up often emerges as a result of a series of compromises, with each party on the look-out to ensure that what is said does not ignore its own interests neither is it prejudicial to them. Such was the case with the world plan of Bucharest. One delegation demanded reaffirmation of the need for appropriate legal protection for the family, the basic unit of society: what harm was .there in satisfying them? Another demanded that the objective of legal and social equality in the treatment of those born within and outside a marriage be stressed ? and so it was. A third was dis? turbed by the reference to polygamy which appeared in the draft: it was cut out. And so on and so forth. Anyone who, unacquainted with this, while making a dispassionate, delayed examination of the final version aware of the incoherence and ambiguity in it, must not judge those responsible too severely. Only someone who realizes the frenetic overlapping of sessions, contacts, amendments and inter? ventions of those hot August days will fully understand them. No unexceptionable document, not only from the legal point of view, but looked at from any point of view whatsoever, could emerge from such a place. it is easy to draw the conclusion that if, in areas of our most specific</page><page sequence="8">8 interest, we take into consideration all the indications furnished by various places and in various forms in the ambit of the United Nations system as a basis of positive law, we shall come up against grave difficulties. Uncertainties would arise of the same type that can explain the reluctance of certain countries to sign Pacts which deal mostly with material already taken into account in their constitutions, hallowed by lengthy experimentation,,on which legal science has been exercised for a long time and all the jurisprudence has been built, both responsible for essential work in clarification, in abstracting first principles and deriving precise inferences. Another criticism made of those texts is that they reflect Western exper? ience too much and are not sufficiently flexible to be adapted with the necessary realism to the pluralism of ideas of different peoples. In this line of thinking, a specific example which might closely interest us would be the idea of marriage. However, as a rule, there might be seen in them an excessive insistence on the individual, lavish in the listing of rights and not well-balanced by too general a mention of duties. The text of the first clause of Article 29 of the Declaration of 1948 is typical: ?Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible?. it would seem that at the origin of duties towards the community lies only the duty of ??? if not even solely an interest in ? free and full development of one's own personality. And hasn't the development of that of others anything to do with the bases of those duties? Can one conceive of healthy and longlasting communal life as egoistic self-fulfilment? fn addition to the distortion quoted, a further reason for the inadequacy of those ?texts? may be found in verifying that they originate in the meeting of different speculative ideologies. Indeed it can be maintained that the existence of at least this common denominator is a happy coincidence, or even a clear sign of the validity of its contents; and that nothing remains to be done but to put these into practice. Unfortunately, there is a reason for believing that the ideological disagreements, set aside or smoothed out in written formulae and principles, re emerge insidiously just at the moment of interpretation and judgement of an actual case. Has it not happened to us more than once, and precisely in matters of demog? raphic importance, that Supreme Court judges arbitrarily put the sword of Brennus of their own ideological choices on the scales? If this could happen with interpretative judgements on the fundamental charters of individual countries, is it not even more plausible to expect it in relation to laws of external origin? These and other even more severe criticisms can be made about the work of the United Nations ? and I have dwelt on this as the most relevant ? in the field of human rights. And yet! And yet I think I can accept as my own the opinion of whoever defined the universal declaration as a ?great act of conscience of the judi? cial thinking of contemporary man? (V. Frosini). I sense in it the voice of modern man as opposed to the barbarism of tyrants who claim to be above the law and to use it as a mere instrument of their own power, f see in it the enemy of the</page><page sequence="9">9 absolute monarch of yesteryear, of the ?general will? of Rousseau, of the ?Me? of today, who wants everything and everyone to be subservient to its pleasure, of any hypostatised form which reduces men to slaves. I recognize in it the restoration of the indispensable ethical basis of law and institutions, the continuation of the historical function of the Prophetism, the appeal to unwritten laws, or to natural law delved out in cordibus. rising as the ultimate weaponless defence of the weak against the most powerful. SOME BASIC PRINCIPLES In the Organizing Committee's invitation I thought I saw ? perhaps rashly ? not a suggestion simply to survey present-day and emerging situations but the expectation of a personal effort to deepen knowledge and make proposals. Setting about this, I know very well I am leaving a road bristling with obstacles but at least one familiar to us, and venturing along a route void of reassuring checks. I can no longer remain only a demographer, nor strictly speaking a scientist in the usual sense. I must in fact make what I consider to be an ideological choice, in the sense already stated, before further discussion. With this I present myself in all humility, aware of its lack of rational constraint, conscious of my fallibility and of the severe limits imposed on me by my weakness and ignorance. On the other hand, I maintain that no-one can talk about human rights today, and profess to measure any political action by their yard-stick, without clarifying the contents and foundations of the same. I am certain the audience will excuse me if, on a problem which needs quite a different development, I find myself forced to be extremely concise and apodictic. At this point a historico-semantic analysis of the word 'd i r i 11 o' (3) comes to my aid ? valid for all languages in which the same etymology has given rise io words with parallel meanings ? treated by a colleague specializing in Roman law, Bernardo Albanese (I). 'Diritto' comes from directum, gradually substituting the old ius in the Middle Ages. Directum is from dirigere (and this from regere) which is quite a special way of giving orders. It is not in fact, states Albanese, an imperare or an iubere (not connected with ius) ?... which refer to the type of command in which those to whom it is addressed are considered only as almost passive execu? tants in an authoritarian context or one of force. Rather, in dirigere one finds a different reality: something in which the aspect of 'guiding', 'directing', of seeking (*&gt;) The Italian word Miritto' is used when there is an opportunity of underlining its double meaning in the sense explained later. (1) B. ALBANESE, Verba tene, res sequentur,&lt;&lt;Quaderni del diritto e del processo civile?,di Salvatore Satta, II, 1969.</page><page sequence="10">10 free and conforming conduct is predominant. The subjects of 'diritto' are assumed, according to the philosophy implied by the word we are interest in, to be free beings, by definition, in the fullness of their humanity?. But directum, the noun formed from the past participle, draws attention, rather than to the ?activity of guiding and directing)), to the resultant effect, a state of affairs which, according to the meaning stated oidirigere, is thought of as ?human, harmonious, and free?. 'Diritto' has a double meaning, an objective and a subjective one ? although not in English where right refers only to the latter, whilst law is used for the former ? which are, respectively, that of a legal system, of a system of norms, etc., or that of the attribution of advantages, and only advantages, to a subject. In this division, whose origins go back a long way (and was unthinkable for ius) that ?synthetic feeling of 'diritto'? born out of the ?merging into a single unit of the values contained in dirigere (an activity of putting into order), in directum (the order resulting from that activity) and in rectum (the ideal criterion of justice))) has come to die out or be lost. According to Albanese, a recovery of these values is made possible if 'diritto' is understood as ?order?: more precisely, as a specific order which is distinguishable from amongst the various orders conceivable ?... in so far as it is necessary and sufficient for the existence)) of a society. It is an order which means not only a command but also ?... a harmonious disposition of many entities, which are in order, precisely, when their reciprocal relationships consist of stable harmonious forms?:ordered relationships, naturally, set in a society of ?free and rational beings?. And Alba? nese follows this up by stating ?... if by 'diritto' one means order (in the complex sense previously pointed out), by a subjective 'diritto' one must mean the order which is a subject's expectation. And then it would seem to be incorrect to limit subjective 'diritto' to just the attribution of advantages, and one would also have to include the attribution of disadvantages: duty would be added to power at the very heart of the subjective 'diritto'?. So far goes my colleague. Continuing, the argument becomes, or goes on being, overtly ontological. Society is made up of rational beings, who, gifted with self-awareness and free will, are aware of their knowledge and capable of setting goals to achieve, of distinguishing between various ends, or between dif? ferent, equally effective means towards the same end, of arranging these in order of importance, of making choices, of foreseeing and freely accepting the conse? quences of their own actions, etc. It also deals with socild beings, to bring back an Aristotelian adjective. Now, I do not attach a merely existential meaning to this living with others, being with others, to this Mitsein, but also a teleologicai and dynamic one. Each and every person in being with others has the possibility of living his own life more fully, of reaching self-fulfilnient and perfection, of contributing to the analogous development and expansion of the lives of others. Co-existence also means co-operation in an interweaving of relationships between individuals which gives rise to expectations and rights for everyone, as well as imposing obligations and duties. No-one can only receive without at the same</page><page sequence="11">11 time giving (even a madman gives to his neighbour: at least it affords him an opportunity of feeding his own altruism). No-one can be reduced to being simply someone else's tool. Things, plants, animals, institutions, are tools for man, but other human beings are not, otherwise the.y would lose their own essential identity as free people. Beyond every individual variation whether innate, or tied to fortune, social conditions or culture, everyone is on the same level in these reciprocal relationships, is equal because of their fundamental natural charac? teristics, because of their existential purpose. The symmetry between obligations and rights, and equality are also valid for the relations between single individuals and society, or between groups of people: no-one is anyone else's master, no-one can demand only advantages and shirk his load. In the ?harmonious disposition? already mentioned, co-essential to the expectation of what is due is the responsibility to commit oneself so that others can benefit from the right claimed in their own turn. Or, in negative terms, which I like less and which are not perhaps as suitable: no-one can cheat another person out of the right he claims for himself, no-one can deliberately put someone else at a disadvantage in relation to the attainment of all that he anticipated for himself, no-one can make another pay the penalty for his own mistakes or misdeeds. Rectum, i.e. what is just, provides support and serves as a model for this har? monious and stable disposition, in particular in so far as it concerns distributive jus? tice but also in a higher sense of apportioning the means a person may have at his disposal in relation to the fullest development attainable given his potential. Orderly living together implies again respect for others, and also, or maybe above all, truthfulness and loyalty, in the absence of which there is less likelihood of weaving responsible inter-relationships in so far as one does not know how to foresee the consequences of one's own actions either for oneself or for others. There is certainly nothing new in what I have tried to say. Many others have said as much far more forcibly and clearly, and then the argument could flow on in various directions.But time presses and I must leave this discussion in the air for the moment to take it up again later on as and when it is necessary. Instead I may add that, in my opinion, such a position is wholly reconciliable with ? if not underlying ? classic statements on human rights, where furthermore at times it is recalled to mind explicitly. I am also perfectly aware of the fact that my exposition has left certain problems of the first order unresolved. What, for example, does integration and full development of one's own personality mean, and how does one arrive at this? In trying to reply to such a question, there is obviously scope for the widest differentiation of ideological positions. But if I am not mistaken what I have said must still have cleared the ground of some positions which, however, have found well-versed supporters recently and not so recently. It does not seem to me, for example, that I have left ground for supermen and Leviathans. Rather there still remains something to be said to delimit the subcategory of basic human rights (and duties) within the category of rights (and duties). I</page><page sequence="12">12 do not propose to drawn up a list, arising in part from its link with histori? cal circumstances and from progressive deductive and inductive clarification. I shall only try to identify what essential characteristics a right must have in order to rise to the level of a human right, which puts it as a prim in relation to eve? ry other right, and which indeed makes it such as to stand above every system of positive norms which cannot be opposed to it: a right which finds its limits only in rights of the same type,one's .on n or those of other subjects. I maintain that this characteristic can be verified in rights by the violation of which the subject is wronged in qualities essential to him as a human being; for example when an attempt is made to deprive him of his life, his freedom, or his consciousness, etc. The ontologicai discourse is obviously turning up again. To make someone lose consciousness artificially ? other than temporarily and in his own interest as with an anaesthetic ?, for example by ?brain-washing?, is to violate a human right. To forbid being stupified with drugs is not. Here duty and responsibility re-emerge, indissolubly linked to right. If 1 am a slave I am not a man in the full sense of the word, being unable to enjoy my liberty: this is true even when I am a slave to my vices. It seems to rne a contradiction in terms to claim the voluntarily transforming of myself into a non-man ? implying by this losing the possibility of claiming human rights (for example, that of life) ? as a ?human right?. But this is not sufficient. The considerations just dealt with help us to understand the foundation of those human rights which are sometimes labelled negative, in the sense of being a freedom from something. If,, however, one goes back to the idea put forward previously of a harmonious and dynamic social fabric in which individuals work together towards the expansion and perfection of their own personality, one sees another category of rights being asserted, still qualifying as human, in so far as their fulfilment gives support to the first and permits their fuller enjoyment. The defence and exercise of these rights demand not a refraining from obstruction, or a removing, as with the first, but on the contrary a giving: they imply active behaviour, definable as positive, from each person and. from the entire body politic and from the State in particular. The eradication of poverty, the chance to educate oneself and to choose a job, equality in the eyes of the law, the community's effective participation in poli? tical affairs all come into this category of rights, making human existence richer and freer, and safeguarding its dignity. It is obvious that historical circumstances have a bearing on the emergence of rights in this second category, whilst the, first are exempt from this. Moreover, on this ground it is not easy to trace the boundaries within which real, basic rights exist. I suppose that always dining on caviar and champagne cannot qualify as a right which is essential to human dignity, whilst that of not being forced to barter your own freedom ? with anyone, with another individual as well as with State power ? for your daily bread does. But a whole gamut of situations ranges in between and it seems very hard to single out points of discontinuity.</page><page sequence="13">13 Besides this, it is also difficult to decide among rights which are competi? tive, where the satisfaction of one person involves sacrifices for others, as it appears clear for the second category indicated of basic rights, though it also holds good for those of the first, depending a lot on actual circumstances. Thus positive human rights ? in the sense indicated, not in that of ius in civitate positum ? are closely conditioned by history and by specific situations. The abstract listing of rights which cannot be enforced ? as might be that of immigration today ? could seem an empty exercise. There are already those, indeed, who are critical' about the work and numerous declarations of the whole United Nations system in this direction, maintaining that they only serve to give rise to expectations which end in frustation and that they are a fraud. In the last six-year plan put forward at the session of the UNESCO General Conference held in Nairobi last year it is clearly written that human rights must not be devalued by a plethora of texts bearing with them false hopes and hiding the sad truth; that establishing new norms is not as useful as plumbing the depths of those that already exist, that a man ?situated in time and place? must be protected ?before creating new rights for the benefit of an abstract, non-existent man?. POPULATION POLICIES: INTRODUCTION Before sifting demographic policies through the principles! have expound? ed, it would be useful to survey, if only fleetingly, some of the actual elements that condition them, and some of the dominant ideologies amongst these elements. I must leave it at that, though I do so reluctantly, because even reducing it to an impressionistic sketch would mean lengthening this already ample discourse beyond all tolerable limits of endurance. Some points will be lightly touched on from time to time in order to keep our sensibilities alert for the value systems within which political action finds itself channelled, flashes of light on a variegated panorama which, as a whole, we must leave veiled in the background. In an extremely synthetic form, we may label as population policies government actions which influence demographic variables. Inaction may also be included in it, in so far as an agnostic and laisser faire position also has an effect. On the other hand, absolute non-interference on any demographic parameter whatsoever is unknown: one need only think how common is interference with international migration movements in the form of detailed rules and regulations. I have talked about governments, as is the custom, even though one should refer to the whole public sector, and particularly to the State, divided into its executive, legislative and judicial functions. Neither should it be forgotten that the political community as a whole ? of which the State is only a part and an instrument groups as well as individuals, all exercise an influence over demographic events: and here I am not referring to the fact that such events originate from a myriad</page><page sequence="14">14 of isolated decisions of individuals?amilie"s and limited bodies but to private actions directing or conditioning other people's decisions .and with this demographic phenomena in general. The choice of where to locate industrial investments,.illegal recruitment of foreign labour, scientific discoveries about mechanisms connected with reproduction, messages on the pages of a daily newspaper aiming at mani? pulating public opinion are some of the countless examples which could be put forward in this connection. There, are a good many variables on which political intervention, in the above mentioned sense of the word, can have a bearing: total size of the popula? tion, the form and rhythm of its dynamics in absolute or relative terms, the components of the same also as absolute values or as rates; and again, the various characteristics of the population, such as its age and sex structure, its social make? up, its territorial distribution, its relations with the outside world. Soviet authors would include amongst these social mobility, which often goes together with territorial mobility, as does mobility between sectors of economic activity and between firms. The above-mentioned public actions taken as a whole may or may not form part of a policy which has been explicitly laid down and deliberated on; they are characterised by the various degrees to which power is involved, as abstract econometric exercise, occasional event, continuous practice, forming part of a wider programme, and backed by proper organizing support; they can be understood as simply a collection of data, but one which is indispensable and valuable, ranging from the spreading of information, and going as far as evaluating procedures of the results obtained by applying specific plans of action for predetermined objectives, with feed-back for later developments. They include direct action, such as immigration restrictions, and other forms which have a mediating influence, such as the legislation on contraception, or indirect action, as with the regulations on landownership, inheritance, housing policy, jobs for women, and so on. Demographic policy may spring from the weight brought to bear by small pressure groups. Apart from the case when these are merely the expression of egoistic and special interests, I maintain that this is still a risk even when enlightened elites are behind it. It in fact impinges on fundamental moments in the life of each person. An essential condition for the success of demographic policy is that it be founded on the most fully thought out, convinced, responsible general consensus. After all, the achievement of the desired results often requires behaviour which is correct and to the purpose from the people involved, and individual self-control, which the State alone is hardly in a position to promote. There are too many delicate decisions to take and a balance to achieve between conflicting interests ? between the young and old, the present and future genera? tions, between different parts of the social body ? for a government to be allowed to neglect the widest possible participation in dealing with them. Demographic policies are not pursued for their own sake, but for more</page><page sequence="15">15 general ends which the State, as an instrument at the service of single individuals as well as of society as a whole, proposes to achieve with the general welfare of the community in mind, which is the basis for, and legitimization of, its interven? tion. In its action, the State can act simply as a catalyst for voluntary, individual decisions or it can resort to its powers of coercion: in each case a choice of means must be made, which necessarily originates in a value system and by itself consti? tutes a moral decision in addition to a juridical fact. It is here, in the ambit of how to determine ends and the ways to attain them, that the field opens up for the various ideologies and the problem of their relation to human rights is set. In the light of the principles set out, and moving on to an evaluation of the reality emerging in the area of demographic policies, I am omitting some themes which could be proposed for a non-too-distant future: I rely on the perspicacity of colleagues like Jean Bourgeois-Pichat, in their ?existential? and ?essential? lives, for arguments like the predetermination of sex at conception, foetus transplants, or alchemies of biological engineering. I am stopping instead on some points which I claim are more worthy of reflection today, in various sectors and from different angles. INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION I shall begin my examination starting off with a field in which firm politi? cal action is the order of the day and the determining factor: I am referring to international migration on which precisely, in one form or another and for various aims, every State intervenes with carefully-considered laws. The world is divided into States which are jealous of their own sovereignty and this is a fact one must be resigned to, even if one can recognize in it a prime source of many inequal? ities in existence today. It may be that later generations will condemn present day reality as immoral and scandalous, as we may do today in relation to past slave regimes: let us hope that, in judging us on such a subject, they will be understanding and indulgent in recognizing our present intellectual and emotional difficulties. The right to emigrate ? from one's own or any other country ? as the expression of the fundamental right for everybody to find the most suitable ways to develop his own potential fully, is recognized in international documents and also in constitutional charters. There is silence, however, on the right to immigrate and this is quite understandable: a State has first the duty, and consequently the right, to work for the common good of the community. If, on the other hand, one accepts the principle of everyone's joint responsibility for everybody's future, it follows that every State also has a duty of being sensitive to the needs of others, and of meeting them even by welcoming immigrants if this can help without wreaking serious damage on the domestic economic, social</page><page sequence="16">16 and political order. Paying attention only to one's own standard of living, ignoring circumstances in which in other countries the basic necessities are not taken care of, whilst one could have lent a hand, sounds like a violation of human rights. Having said this, it should also be added that in present-day circumstances it would be difficult to consider emigration as a realistic solution to pressure and population growth if this involves broad masses of the population. It is not enough, in fact, to move people. It is also necessary that tension does not build up, that a gradual assimilation takes place, that stable and living communities be formed. One may ask the host society to respect, for example, the culture and language of new-arrivals, to accept for themselves too an evolution and enrichment in a multi-cultural sense. One cannot impose on a host country organized minorities who remain substantially and permanently foreign. There must be limits ? in the immigrants' own interests too ? on how many people can be integrated into a different community within a given space of time. Moreover this process needs capital which, as an alternative solution, might be more usefully invested in the countries of origin to stimulate economic development suitable for keeping mi? grants on the spot. Even this solution has its drawbacks, surrounded as it is by a climate of fear and suspicion against foreign investment in the home country. As examples of directions in which, compared with previous practices, there appear to be greater respect for human dignity, one may put forward the latest regulations on priorities in issuing immigration visas adopted by the United States and Australia: the former abandoned the rigid system of quotas by country and has given priority to uniting families, the latter has changed from an ethnic criterion to one of professional qualifications. On the other hand, serious problems on the grounds of human rights are posed by not a few massive irregular immigra? tions, above all the fact that those entering illegally easily find themselves without any defence against economic exploitation on the part of unscrupulous employers. On this subject, each case has its own particular history and one cannot propose a uniform solution. But it seems permissible to hope, as a general principle, that the State concerned would assume an attitude at once flexible and clear, making assimilation easier for those already resident for some time and promoting the reunification of families, but at the same time penalizing those who promote illegal trafficking, or who speculate on it. On migration of a temporary nature for job motives, Massimo Livi Bacci has written some enlightening material, with particular reference to Western Europe (5). In this case, rather than migrations one might talk about the movement of manpower and Livi Bacci has made it clear that, in his opinion, as such it answers only contingent and superficial interests, not the real basic needs of the (5) M. LIVI BACCI, Report on the Demographic and Social Pattern of Migrants in Europe, Especially with Regard to International Migrations. Part I: The Countries of Emigra? tion, Council of Europe, 2nd European Population Conference, Strasbourg 1971.</page><page sequence="17">17 countries of origin or of destination, and of the workers themselves. For the former, it concerns lessening employment pressures and crediting remittances against a balance of payments deficit. For the latter, there is the advantege of finding adaptable and replaceable personnel at one's disposition whom one can often entrust with duties the indigenous population does not like. A limited con? tract, one year at the most, is a convenient instrument in so far as it is of suffi? cient length to make the job productive and at the same time ensures plenty of elas? ticity. The migrants, on their side, find work more easily and earn more than at home. And they save ? how they save! ? accepting separation from their families, segregated in ghettoes, with very little contact with the local people, without any stimulus to learn the language, deprived, as a rule, of the possibility of making any real progress in their professional training. They end up by returning unpre? pared to use their accumulated savings productively and not laying down a solid base either for their own future or for the development of their country. As for those who have been their hosts, the choice of basing their own expansion on cheap foreign labour rather than investing in their own demographic development is not one which, in the long run, augurs a rosy future. Livi Bacci is right in writing that everyone must know that there is a price to pay to improve the situation. And this is not only a matter of economic costs, because break-ups and separations are brought about which go well beyond eco? nomics and mere legal factors only, involving psychological aspects and mores. Turning one's attention to a list of possible remedies to some of the most obvious inadequancies, the following might be mentioned: 1) facilitating the reuniting of families, above all by adequately facing the problem of housing; 2) ensuring com? plete equality with the indigenous population on the level of social and economic rights with the possibility of changing jobs when this does not evidently damage local labour; 3) taking care of the professional training, and level of instruction in general, at least of the young; 4) extending the length of contracts; 5) allowing foreign workers to participate in the organization of forms of assistance, and leisure time occupations; etc. Leaving aside questions like the right of asylum, expulsion, the fate of refugees and the like which take up plenty of space in international documents, a final point to be touched on in the field of international migrations is that of the ?brain drain?, which concerns many different developing countries. One certainly cannot question the right to freedom of movement of any category of people whatsoever, unless, , perhaps, restriction is imposed for their own and greater good. But it is not only this aspect which must be kept in mind. If one accepts the principle stated above that every right is linked to a corresponding duty, it seems permissible to expect from someone who sees a way open to improve his own position greater concern for the needs of others, particularly his fellow countrymen who, being closest to him, have perhaps also made the most sacrifices for him, and in any case can be more easily understood and helped. I would stress this recall to a sense of responsibility on the part of every citizen, and particularly</page><page sequence="18">18 those most gifted, in relation to the nation s ideals. Even here, it is not so much a question of juridical limitations, which can easily be avoided, as of the education of personality. To this end, along with suitable economic incentives, may go shrewd internal policies on the level of organizing instruction and research centers, if necessary maintained by international co-operation, which would give rise to possibilities and prospects on the spot ? or within a region ? thus drying up at source one of the main reasons for the flow. INTERNAL MIGRATION In the various regions a State is divided into, the internal migratory waves stand out quite often in greater relief, as regards the dynamics of a population and its structure, than those of births and deaths, whether for numerical consis? tency, or for their selective character, or finally for changes with time and the char? acteristic difficulty in forecasting which creates the greatest obstacles for those who try to calculate demographic projections for restricted areas. Local problems which have their origin in internal migrations are often more serious than those caused by natural increase. Phenomena such as urban congestion, heterogeneity and tensions between groups of citizens, depopulation and impoverishment of rural zones, are all as a rule connected with migration and with the ways in which it occurs, more than with the total amount of population. Despite this, the ample literature on demographic policies pays relatively little attention to the distribution or population by area which is hardly ever the only, and rarely even the principal, object of political action. On the other hand the aims con? cerning a population's territorial settlement are barely distinguishable from those more general ones of the country's overall economic and social development, in every place and under every regime. Freedom of movement and choice of place of residence, closely linked with the concrete exercise of other rights, are explicity recognized as basic rights. At an individual and family level it is nothing but the expression of a search for better conditions to realize one's own potential, in terms of greater well-being, of more secure and varied professional options, of more satisfactory social serv? ices, etc. Moreover.spatial mobility is generally an indispensable condition for pro? gress, for structural change and for modernisation at a macro-social level. But these transfers also go hand in hand with costs of various types, sometimes to the extent of nullifying the looked-for benefits completely and harming whole social groups. Women and children may come up against much greater difficulty in adapting to the new environment than the working head of the family who is psychologically more prepared for the change. Changes of residence resulting from erroneous information and expectations, rather than from real opportunities for social evolu</page><page sequence="19">19 tion may turn into merely decanting poverty and depriv ation territorially. Urban concentration may give rise not only to environmental but also to spiritual pol? lution. The disproportionate weighting given as a result of political decisions to certain lots of citizens, particularly the middle class and the unionised working class, is at the bottom of seriously disproportionate public investment, diverted, for example, to give preference to accelerated expansion in the educational sectors and types of jobs which suit these classes better, with the resultant strengthening of the urban pull, of ill-fated influxes, of fringe poverty. The attitude of govern? ments, who have not the strength to set themselves up as impartial judges, emerges as ambiguous and inconsistent, also because of the objective difficulty of recon? ciling impulses towards modernisation and the necessity of keeping people tied to the fields. The principle of respect for freedom of movement excludes any recourse to coercing individuals, except in cases of greater necessities, sanctioned by law , f.i. in rare emergencies or when the principle is in conflict with universal rights; also clearly inadmissible is forcing whole communities to move, which at times goes to the extremes of genocide. Acceptable or beneficial are, on the other hand, instruments (economic, social, juridical) working directly or indirectly, when used to channel legitimate personal aspirations in the direction of defending freedom for everybody or promoting greater general welfare: rules for the location of eco? nomic enterprises or residential projects; admistrative decentralisation and spread? ing social services to rural zones; creating development centres and new towns; incentives to send labour force and professional skills to areas in which there are natural resources to be exploited; services for prior information and then guidance for those moving from the land to urban centres; etc. There are many plans in hand, but there are also many failures in an area in which there is still so much to learn. We demographers could be of assistance to politicians by stimulating their imaginations in anticipating the wide range* of immediate and long-term conse? quences of their intervention as far as population is concerned. We can join others in stressing the ever more vital importance of space, in scotching the scandalous operation of real estate speculators who no longer even earn the merit of running risks, in making it easier to recover for the benefit of all the windfull profits which are reaped because of events, which our own work will have helped to predict with ever greater precision. But, even in this field, public action is certainly not enough. Certain barriers erected through prejudice, such as on account of the colour of one's skin, religion, or other reasons fiercely resist any control by legal or administrative regulations. They will only fall when respect for the dignity of human beings and for their basic rights has firmly taken root in everybody's conscience.</page><page sequence="20">20 MORTALITY ?Whatsoever house I enter, there will I go for the benefit of the sick?, says the doctor taking the traditional Hippocratic oath dedicating himself in his vocation to bringing the light of hope into the sad, grey room of the suffering, and his acts are branded with nobility from the sacredness of life which they have in their care. The right to life and, as a natural corollary, to the highest level attainable of physical and mental health, is fundamental and the same for every? body, as is the dominion held over everybody by death's impartial majesty . We would be naive, misinformed and blindly optimistic if we maintained that it is like this in real life, that this right finds equal respect and fulfilment everywhere and for everyone. I am not referring to patent diversities between countries, but to less comprehensible and justifiable ones existing inside a single State, for example between those who live in towns and those inhabiting rural areas. I have not got in mind so much the greater ease, in comparison with the poor and weak, enjoyed by the powerful and rich in securing the most expensive health facilities and the most effective treatment. I am thinking rather of the discrimination which is simply rooted in ignorance. It makes one depressed to note how often failure to resort to services which nevertheless exist, or failure to use them in the best possible way, comes from cultural backwardness, from insufficient information, from inability to stir oneself and make use of one's actual rights. One cannot meet such personal shortcomings by greater financial expenditure or more precise bureaucratic regulations of medical health services, but rather by extending general education, and by the training of every category of medical staff to full respect for the dignity of every person: precisely in the spirit ofthat oath I quoted. It is a good opportunity to add that one must appeal to the same sense of moral conscience and self-discipline - in this case, of researchers ?, rather than to public control (surely necessary and cautiously administered), for the respect of rights and fundamental dignity in the case of experiments on man: one knows how often research is centered on subjects least able to defend themselves, institutionalized patients, poor, ignorant people, children, foetuses removed alive by induced abor? tions, and inhabitants of underdeveloped countries. The dynamics of mortality is at the origin of much present-day preoccupa? tion with population trends: despite this, its control is more the subject of social policy than demographic policy. The direction of intervention, in fact, can only be one-way and its effect, taken as a whole, can work only in one direction. The demographic relevance of the various forms of intervention has not been studied much, and demographic impacts do not constitute a basic motive for steps taken to affect mortality even in the case of infant mortality, whose decline is considered by some the determining factor for controlling fertility. The commitment to fight disease and death increasingly more effectively is self-evident, but one does not</page><page sequence="21">21 stick to considerations of demographic dynamics in establishing, for example, the allocation of resources for such a purpose and expenditure aimed at making the days of the living more and more happy ? however few or many they may be. Neither are we guided by such considerations when pharaonic installations are put up for high-level specialization while vast health sectors are left in penury, paying for the privilege and prestige of a few with the sacrifice of many; nor, on the contrary, when goals of equity are pursued to ensure the change of adequate treatment for all categories, regardless of financial possibilities, age, sex, etc. In conclusion one may say that the degree to which justice and human rights are honoured by a society in this area depends on the measure to which treatment is ensured for the most under-privileged of its members. MARRIAGE The expression ?demographic policy? has been used also in a narrow sense to indicate a ?policy intended to act on the spontaneous tendencies of fecundity?. Going into this specific area now, we may first remind ourselves of the classic Malthusian remedy for the fatal course on which demographic evolu? tion was bound, that of moral restraint which meant at least delaying marriage until one was sure of being able to maintain a family. Over the centuries we know of various examples of interference with marriage customs by political authority with the aim of influencing the demographic dynamics of populations or particular classes. In this post-war period, little attention has been paid to such instruments of demographic policies until recent years. They have been the years waiting for the ?ideal? contraceptive which would solve all questions: why set off on a road bristling with obstacles like that of modifying deep-rooted marriage customs reinforced by social circumstances and life philosophies, running the risk of appearing to be dictators of freedom, when the perfect contraceptive would clear up all worries? Were there not perhaps concrete examples of legislative reform which remained a dead letter? On the other hand, what result could a limited delay of marriage have when so much fertile time still remained in which, making up for lost years by increased fecundity, it was still possible to ensure the same final descent? Before examining some more recent tendencies in this connection, it is a good opportunity to stop and make some remarks on the scope of human rights on this subject. In this connection, comparing it with classic formulations, the 1948 Declaration has something new, subsequently confirmed in the 1966 Pact on civil and political rights: to be precise, the acknowledgement that everyone, of legal marriage age, has the right to marry and start a family, linked to the requirement of the intending spouses" lull and free consent and of their equal</page><page sequence="22">22 rights during marriage and until its dissolution. Along with the attestation of this right goes the reassertion of the concept of the family as the natural and basic element of society, and as such having the right to the protection by society itself and by the State. By this, explicit recognition is given to the social function fulfilled and to the social status assumed by the spouses and by all members of the family, and similarly to the consequent duties and rights. Marriage is not the outcome of a whim, nor a private act, but a solemn undertaking made in front of the whole community: the necessary freedom of consent in taking it on is a condition and, at the same time, an expression of personal responsibility for the consequent duties,for the fulfilment of which one has the right to special attention and care on the part of the social body. The marriage institution is a complex reality of people, rights and obligations: for example, the duties of a couple to each other, towards their children and vice versa, and of all of them to the com? munity in which they live. The multiplicity and physical and psychic complementa? rity of people, the variety of interrelationships experienced in a state in which affection, authority, freedom, natural competition, patient tolerance, wider know? ledge, spirit of sacrifice, unity despite diversity, all exist together, and make the family unequalled and irreplaceable as a socializing element. It is firmly rooted in the couple's loyalty to their original undertaking, continually born out in ? and protected by ? the fidelity and stability of their relationship, which is an essential condition for bringing up and educating their offspring, the future adult members of society, and so providing the principal basis of the right to special protection from the last. Set against the principles expounded here, one finds the greatest diversity in actual examples and concrete interpretations of marriage and the family, let alone in the status of the people involved. From marriage in the Confucian tra? dition whereby, through the union of two people, one sees that of two families and the start of a new line of descendance across the centuries, and as such constitutes the object of inter-family agreements, to marriage considered as the outlet of romantic love, from the Jewish?Yahwist and Christian conception of the couple, to that expressed in Islamic laws, the distances are enormous. The person who, going back to the basic principles enunciated at the beginning of this report, c onsi? ders he ought to point out lack of respect for fundamental rights in the case where marital unions are arranged by relations, could well declare, in accordance with the same principles, violations of equal rights among those peoples in which one marriage out of two these days disintegrates, calmly disregarding the children's interests*. The married state is something quite other than a union, formalised as much as one wants, in which each person seeks gratification and self-realization: it is a disinterested, faithful, constant dedication and giving of oneself to another, of oneself to all the other components of the family, and in this lies its prime social function. Incentives to marriage introduced as an indirect instrument to encourage</page><page sequence="23">23 greater overall births ? but here too one must repeat that social and demographic purposes are often barely distinguishable ? are in practice in various forms in several countries. Those that are economic ? non refundable subsidies, loans on favourable terms, aid with housing, etc. ? can be interpreted as solidarity on the part of the community at a critical moment in family life. Others, however, like exclusive career privileges, or for obtaining a given job, in favour of those who are married, seem to me to be a jarring offence against freedom of choice for people having different vocations. In recent years the reverse direction has become increasingly fashionable, re-echoing the Malthusian proposal previously quoted. It began by pointing out that, even if the number of children remains the same, a higher average age at marriage would raise the average age at childbirth and thus permit the lengthening of generations. The accent was then put on the fact that, by delaying a woman's start to married life, greater time is left to increase her own education and eventual? ly prove herself in extra-domestic activity,thus allowing her to gain a maturity and state of mind that would have an influence both on her personal attitude and on her relations with her spouse concerning decisions to be made relating to offspring. Again, it was pointed out that raising the minimum legal marriage age could at the very least have a psychological effect even in Stales where the widespread absence of registration of births jeopardized the enforcement of the law. Finally, ever increasing notice has been given, as an example to be held up, to the signs coming from the People's Republic of China, on methods followed there and on the results obtained in this field. In fact, in numerous countries the prescribed legal age as been raised for both sexes; although such innovations have been accompanied at times by a lowering of the age below which parental consent is necessary. Various incentives have also been adopted or studied to increase the age at marriage, above all in the form of economic assistance provided the bride ? or both partners ? is over a set age. There has not been sufficient experimentation to give a clear answer as to the practical effectiveness of these measures, whether as to distribution of marriages by age, or their relative frequency, or numbers of offspring. It must not be forgotten that the norm is not the same as actual practice, and that to influence mores it is necessary to resort to a vast programme involving a multiplicity of concrete causes which shape prevalent practice. But interventions of this sort, even if seeming suitable, can be interpreted badly and thus result in high individual and social psychological costs. This is particularly so with women: pushing them to marrying later, or giving up marriage, without offering them valid alternatives, can mean condemning them for years, or for all their lives, to a subordinate position. Similarly, in certain industrialised countries, early marriage by the young, who continue to lean on their parents for financial support, has become a way of staying for years in a state of immaturity verging on the infantile. Apart from political action, marriage has always been subject to social</page><page sequence="24">24 control. Both social control and political action can alter in the face of new circumstances. Today attention is being paid to the modification of marriage, patterns as a means of checking fertility as a whole. It seems to me that, if one wants to take this road, it should not be thought of simply as a technical instru? ment to achieve the desired effect, but rather should be gone along a&gt; a path to be followed in order to increase and make the most of the sense of responsibility with which one must prepare for marriage. Only by acquiring such a responsible maturity in judgement and behaviour first, will it be strengthened and demonstra? ted in the course of married life as married life itself requires, above all in a well thought out and careful decision as to how many children to have. It is difficult to say how much political action and laws can achieve by themselves in this task of the inner education of young people:I think that they are certainly not sufficient alone. They may not be even the principal agents in such education. They must necessarily be accompanied by the conscious effort of everybody in society, beginning with parents, who clearly have both a role and an opportunity. FERTILITY It is rarely possible for a State to be able to control international mi? gratory waves to obtain appreciable results in regulating the whole of its own demographic evolution in the desired directions. As a rule, for such an aim ? discounting the relative inflexibility of mortality as a means of control ? only fertility can be considered. As regards the influence which intervention on marriage customs may have on it, this has already been discussed. We shall now move on to another subject, with the immediate warning that on this terrain contrasts of an ideological origin more easily come to light, as one will be able to verify, even if only through fleeting indications. In this connection, an interpolation is permissible on the meaning of ideological choices in the social field. From so much that has been said we know that ideology too often means an instrument of struggle, of power conquest and of prevarication. We also know that, in the sense previously defined it can con? stitute a seed of understanding about things in life and the world, and bring us nearer to truth. If we want to compare various ideologies in order to arrange them in order of importance, in the first case ? for those who want to use them like this ? the only yardstick to evaluate them becomes that of success. Advance? ment in knowledge, uplifting of minds, etc., do not count for those who think only of crushing others. In the second, a comparison can be made with a serene and open mind: for example, by a dispassionate examination of the meaning of the empirical situation from which an ideology stems and in which it believes</page><page sequence="25">25 to find its confirmation, to evaluate the reliability of the agreement between facts and ideas; by an internal criticism of the coherence and completeness of basic assumptions, and of deductions deriving from them; by a comparison between the latter and the consequences to which putting choices inspired by fundamental ideas into practice leads: by continual vigilance, from the start to the arrival point, within the inner forum of one's own moral conscience. No relativism, therefore, if one does not want to remove completely from ideology all power to stimulate intuition, knowledge and progress. Neither any resort to a clash in affirming the 'best', which it is only possible to attain in a really human sense by an effort to understand the reasons of others, of tolerance, persuasion and testimony. This said, I think it opportune to enounciate first some principles, which will be of use to me later on, by reflecting on a text recently proposed within the system of the United Nations. I am referring to par. 14, f) of the World Popula? tion Plan of Action approved in Bucharest, which states: ?All couples and indi? viduals have the basic right to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and means to do so; the responsibility of couples and individuals in the exercise of this right takes into account the needs of their living and future children, and their responsibility towards the Community?. Let us analyse this statement. The hendiadys which associates freedom and responsibility appears for the first time in Resolution XVIII and with a slight variation in the Proclamation, both approved in Teheran in 1968 on the occasion of the International Conference on Human Rights, in their turn improving on and incorporating previous texts. But responsibility and freedom are complex concepts which require to be deepened at least with the following considerations in mind. I cannot be responsible unless in a context of freedom (otherwise it would be determinism), even if limited (only God can have an absolute one), nonetheless allowing a real multiplicity of attainable alternatives; in a condition in which I am actually able to choose with reference to a value, to a good regarding which my choice has meaning, and the knowledge and desiring of which I am at the very least able to work towards. Responsible action is not merely accidental, but is always directed towards something; as such, it implies the pos? sibility, or rather the requirement, of being judged and, consistently, corrected and punished. But, I repeat, in order for it to be judged and imputable my action must be f r e e, in a situation which contains both a psychological dimension and immunity from external coercion. That is, one finds once again the necessary existence of acceptable options, the knowledge of these and of the consequences of choices taken as a result, the availa?ility of suitable means towards the goals wished for, or which duty requires, the aptitude for evaluating and ordering the alternatives, to make rational decisions about them, to put them into practice. Before going back to the above-mentioned text, let us clear up a point</page><page sequence="26">26 connected to the theme. I have seen it written that one does not find the funda? mental right to procreate confirmed in the documents of the United Nations. The observation seems to me to be out of place. Perhaps one does not read in them that everyone has the right, not only to marry, but also to start a family? What does one want more explicit tharrthat? When the right to live is affirmed, that of breathing is not added. It has been written also that the Teheran decla? rations allow parents to have children as and when they like. This, too, I maintain, is inexact. The principle of freedom of choice for parents against external inter? ference of any kind whatsoever is certainly established in them. But at the same time it is confirmed that the fundamental right refers to a responsible choice, and not just any one. That means it refers to a choice by which, in exercising the right, one assumes responsibility for the fulfiment of analogous or other expectations of other people in regard to the same or other fundamental rights, which one must respect and defend in the carrying out of one's own. In the second clause of the paragraph quoted from Bucharest, an example of these rights of other people is indeed provided, the neglecting of which ? in exercising one's own ? could amount to an abuse. The Bucharest text also talks about the right to adequate information and instruction ?on such questions? (unfortunate wording which leaves uncertain which precise questions it is referring to). If I have grasped the meaning of the phrase correctly, it seems to me the case to add that, apart from a right, it also relates to an opportunity: even if the enlightening of minds is not sufficient in itself, it nevertheless is still a major way to eliminate or minimise abuses. Aiming to get round these by compulsorily setting limits which cannot be crossed to decisions which, in order to be ?human?, must be freely taken and for which responsibility must be accepted, is to strike at the roots of an essential attribute of people and is to treat them like battery hens. Again, the text in question mentions the right to benefit from ?adequate Services?, recalling much the same thing put forward for the first time ? it seems to me ? in a document originating from within the United Nations system in art. 22, b) of the Declaration on Social Progress and Development of 1969.In my opinion, a deduction from the basic concept of autonomously responsible choice is introduced here which commits the sin of partiality. In it, in essence, the particular right to be helped in avoiding the so-called ?unwanted? or ?undesired? births is underlined (I shall not stop for semantic analysis of such fleeting concepts). No-one will deny that ignorance or lack of services constitute formidable obstacles to the exercising of freedom of choice a^ to the number and spacing of children. And the desperate man who submits to sterilisation through urgent need of the money given as an incentive, or married couples who give up having another child in order not to further complicate relations with another family with whom ? through housing scarcity ? they are forced to share a flat are they free, or rather are their essential rights not spurned? The text approved at Bucharest sins by</page><page sequence="27">27 omission, saying nothing about the right lo be able to have desired and wanted children and which one must consciously renounce through circumstances beyond one's own control, through social injustice, or other's mistakes or misdeeds. The exercise of responsibility cannot be seen one-sidedly: otherwise, the right to pro? create is practically ignored for those who live in poverty through no fault of their own. We shall come back to this point of fundamental importance. Finally, by those entitled to the fundamental right under discussion is meant ?every couple and every individual)). Let us remember the kind of justifica? tion brought into the conference ? room in support of the principle of attributing the right to individuals as well as to couples. There are ? it was said ? women who want to have a child, but who do not wish to tie themselves up with marriage. But can we speak of an essential human right in the context of a desire of this sort? To me it does not seem so, and I shall explain why. A child is not a doll which one buys at a supermarket. It is a human being and precisely as such has its own fundamental rights, like that, for example, of not starting off, in all innocence, in an unfavourable position because of others, and least of all because of its mother. For its normal development, the newly-born child has a right to have parents, not just a mother. It has the right as a person not to feel different from others, all its life, because of a condition forced on it at birth. But there is also the father. The fact that a man lends himself to such a solution, albeit voluntarily, or actually with gratitude because ? for example ? he receives a reward, is irrelevant to the conclusions arrived at in judging the action itself, which is to treat another human being as a mere instrument for one's own ends. One cannot talk about human rights when exercising them automatically violates the human rights of others. Let us now turn our attention to the married couple (or even, within its own limitations, to a couple tied together only by mutual consent through recipro? cal relationships of affection and trust. As for the solipsistic practice of two people who are selfishly seeking only their own pleasure, it is not the case to call into question the category of fundamental rights). It has been claimed that, in the case of a couple's conflicting aspirations and opinions, the final decision and responsibility for bringing children into the world, and when to do so, is up to the woman. In the most complete text I have seen on the subject (6) three reasons are given: 1) the principle whereby no-one has the right to exploit the body and labours of another person without his or her consent; 2) the fact that pregnancy and childbirth may severely endanger a woman's health, and even her life; 3) the circumstance that, in the eyes of the family, the society and the mother herself, a woman usually has the greater responsibility for nurturing, protecting and caring (6) UNITED NATIONS, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Status of Women and Family Planning: Report of the Special Rapporteur Appointed by the Economic and Social Council under Resolution 1326 (XLIV), New York, 1975.</page><page sequence="28">28 for young children. Now let u&amp; consider the two possibilities. Either it is the wife who wants to have a child, whilst the husband hesitates, or vice versa. In the former case, the husband may have good reasons for not wanting a child. It is not only biological facts, or looking after the new-born child that is involved. There is also the responsibility to be taken on of continuing to maintain and educate the child until of age, and ensuring the whole family is supported in certain conditions; there may also be a particular psychological component. With a couple it is not necessarily the woman who constitutes the most fragile and vulnerable point in a complex picture of facts, evaluations and previsions. Apart from this, to claim that the husband should follow his wife's own wishes, when he responsibily leans in a different direction, would mean forcing him to be simply an instrument. After so many, well-deserved protests against considering a woman merely an object, do we want to make exactly the same mistake in reverse? The other possibility corresponds perfectly to the first. In neither can one identify an abstract and privileged basic right for one partner rather than the other, who would otherwise be reduced to purely the function of an instru? ment, liable to domination. In an actual situation, possible conflicts must always be examined and settled in the light of equity, that is of justice in a concrete case. The only actual fundamental right which exists for a responsibly independent decision is the indivisible one of the couple. Having forgotten this has made not possible to point out, in the second part of the paragraph, that each partner, in consciously deciding to have a child, must put first whatever is good for the other, and for both of them, to the advantage of all the family. Moving on to examine concrete forms of political intervention as far as fertility is concerned, the themes with which one could begin a discussion crowd in: as it is impossible to treat them systematically, I shall choose some typical examples on this subject. A distinction, in connection with government intervention, is frequently made between those who stay within the limits of so-called family planning and those who cross them and go beyond family planning, as usually said in the litera? ture on the subject in English. It is a distinction I appreciate as a classifying criterion from various points of view, but which I like less when I see with it activities being passed off as means for a policy to control demographic develop? ment, which should not, strictly speaking, figure as such. Let me make myself clear. If birth control, in the terms laid down, is an essential right-duty, safeguard? ing it and making its practical application easier are intrinsic values, which must be pursued as such, to the best of actual possibilities, in every time and place, independently of other different kinds of objectives, and this as much in the public sector as in the private one. Between the personal goal a couple aims at in marriage and the particular social aim of the latter lies a delicate problem of balance, which changes according to circumstances, to be solved by the couple's enlightened conscience. A similarly difficult problem of balance exists between the results</page><page sequence="29">29 of marital decisions and the demands of the social body which it is up to the politician to resolve by arranging everything into a harmonious whole. But such an ?arrangement? is one thing, facilitating the effective exercise of the above mentioned rights is another. If an action aimed at guaranteeing this proves also to be a precious element in the accord between the micro-family level and the macro-social, so much the better: but this does not constitute in itself either the basis or the justification for it (7). Amongst the various means which a government can avail itself of in order to ensure the opportunity to exercise the right-duty in question for the couple, there is the 1 a w. As a deterrent supported by a system of sanctions, a purely formal legitimisation of established customs, an educational school, a po? tential catylist for social change, an essentially revolutionary instrument, or what? ever one wishes to think of it as, the law is, in every particular case, the primary criterion for reference which has moral substance and reflects and ideological view. The technical means today theoretically at the disposition of the couple in case of need are numerous: for example, abstinence, as indicated in declarations of ecclesiastical authorities of the Eastern Ortodox Churches, by Ghandi and by Mrs. Besant when she became a Theosophist; in addition, periodic continence, accepted by the Roman Catholic Magisterium and ? in the past ? by Mormon authorities; a wide range of other contraceptive methods, including the I.U.D. which may result in the waste of products of conception; one of the methods which stop development of the foetus, at any time in its intrauterine life; and surgical sterilization. Positive law, and with it the State, in ruling on birth control methods, follow an ideological and moral vision: in particular, they adopt a specific practical ideology in relation to human rights. What happens, in other words ? focusing attention on another sector ?, is what occurs when it is forbidded to use, on this occasion in order to check and select demographic dynamics, means like the Spartan custom of infanticide, or eliminating those with hereditary defects or anyone who belongs to particular categories from amongst those who have years of fertile life ahead of them. Let us consider infanticide: if it were not lor the burden of pregnancy, it would be for the specified goal and from certain points of view a more convenient method than others mentioned above. If a (7) Along with the basic concept of responsible procreation as a good in itself goes a whole series of other reasons, at times deriving from more general ideological posi? tions. Thus, birth control, if achieved through learning and practice of contraceptive methods, may be seen as a means to reduce resorting to induced abortion; more generally, one may emphasise its fitness as an instrument for the ?liberation? of women from a status seen as merely functional; one may see in it a terrain propitious for the welfare of women and children, and for the improvement of family relationships; one may recognise in it a way to reduce social assistance costs; one finds that it can appear as a less expensive and more easily acceptable component of a national demographic policy; etc. We are moving, thus, gradually from the family level to the macro-social one.</page><page sequence="30">30 deformed child were born, or more than the number one desires in a multiple birth, or one of the wrong sex, one could get rid of it, sparing the mother and family a distressful life and future, possibly causing psychological harm, and taking mental and physical health. Returning to our theme, it seems clear that the necessity of having at one's disposal the means to exercise the fundamental right of birth regulation does not mean the right to use any means that may come to mind, particularly those which infringe other human rights. I find no difficulty, for example, in saying that for me induced abortion is a violation of the fundamental right of a human being, who is such from conception, a living creature, already as distinct from his mother and from any other person as he will be for the rest of his days. In other words, I do not recognise the existence of a fundamental right to abortion and I find, together with others, that the key phrase of the United States Supreme Court sentence of 1973 according to which the right of privacy is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy is surprising in its gratuity. Such a violation also exists for me when abortion is permitted by law: iustum quia iussum is not a valid principle. Personally, I could not let myself, in a seat of law, demand heroism from a mother in order not to put her in prison. But neither should I be disposed to endorse the judicial artifact on an attack on the part of minuscule little beings against, for example ? as ex? perience shows us ?, so many defenceless, poor, ignorant girls from industrialised countries. Rather, I should try every possible way to smooth away the difficulties which a mother encounters in the case of a difficult pregnancy to allow her to give birth in the greatest possible tranquillity. However, I-am not here to pronounce legal formulae either on this com? plex argument, or on others which could affect basic rights-irreversible steriliza? tion (8), relations between husband and wife and between them and their children (9), freedom of conscience of medical personnel, safeguarding health in relation to side effects, etc. I consider it more important to emphasise that, in a pluralistic society, on the one hand the procedure for legitimising legal action on this subject (8) It has been stated that to refuse sterilization to someone who asks for it is to violate a human right. If, as a hypothesis, others claim that sterilization harms a person in his essential quality as a ? free ? human being, in the name of what should a human right be acknowledged for the applicant to have other people submitted to his own way of thinking? (9) I have heard the opinion attributed to doctors that in rural Mexico the I.U.D. would be a particularly convenient instrument in so far as it would allow a wife to avoid pregnancy without her husband's knowledge. Resort to sterilization for men without the wife's consent is often reported in India. The United States Supreme Court decided in 1976 that a woman does not have to have her husband's consent to have an abortion or, if she is under 18, that of her parents. Apart from all other considerations, if one breaks the tie of loyalty, what remains of a family other than fragments?</page><page sequence="31">31 should provide for the widest and most conscious participation equally for every citizen, on the other that the collaboration and critical vigilance of the whole social body must continually be sought and listened to in applying the formulae expressing the majority opinion. But on the subject of basic rights, one expects more from a government than simply a legislative framework of what is permitted and forbidden as and where necessary. Precisely one expects an active work of guarantee, protection and defence. There are those who claim the market is a neutral and sensitive way which, in a period of rapid change, can respond better than a bureaucratic organization to the varying demands for means and proper services for contracep? tion, whilst others emphasise the advantages of freeing such a subject from the profit motive. It is not the time to discuss the merits of these sorts of alternatives. It should be specified, however, that if there is no obligation for State power to provide on its own for everything, it has the obligation to work directly towards integrating spontaneous initiatives where these are not sufficient, and to face up to the needs of couples who otherwise would remain underprivileged. Let us be quite clear, nonetheless, that providing means and services is only part ? and not the most important ? of the problem of encouraging the accomplishment of responsible procreation. Working on the premise that people are to be treated as intelligent and mature, they must be helped in forming their own enlightened opinion, and there must be developed, with such an end in mind, a process of information, consultation, of stimulus towards methodic behaviour and a sense of responsibility with regard to all that can happen in life, in which members and organised groups, which in the political body have a real role as educators, can and do have the right to intervene. At this point, let us take up once again the argument on the right to procreation. Equality for everybody in such a fundamental right is not limited to purely a biological element, but must include the opportunity for everyone to give their children chances to realize their potential on the same level as other people's children.In order that the teleological meaning ?of which I have spoken ? of living together in a community be observed, society must be organized in such a way that the means to develop personal talents and bring them to fruition in the light of potential parity in final results, in comparison with those born in the most advantageous situations, must be ensured for children of the poor and underprivileged despite initial unfavourable conditions. I know very well how difficult it is: the relatively disappointing experience in this direction in the scho? lastic sector is one of so many examples one might consider. But the obstacles must not hide the aim, nor allow the principle in question to be forgotten. For this reason, let us try to avoid facile talk about excessive fertility as the cause of a family's poverty. By definition, everything that is in excess creates lack of balance: so too with relatively excessive poverty resulting from bad social or? ganisation, such as to make impossible or restrict the effective exercising of the right of which we are speaking.</page><page sequence="32">32 Now let us turn our attention to another field. The government's right to exert an influence ? in any direction ? on fertility has been questioned, be? cause all relative decisions must necessarily remain the exclusive concern of the parents. The fact is that decisions, or more generally behaviour, are in every case conditioned by the concrete circumstances in which they express themselves, legal, economic, cultural, of customs and habits, etc., and particularly those having their origins in political actions. If a government, working towards the common good ? that is, towards an improvement of the human living conditions of all, so that everyone at least potentially might enjoy greater liberty, economic security, spirit? ual well-being, etc. ? and in the area of its function to rationalize social life, has the opportunity, if not indeed the necessity, to shape its actions in such a way as to change the framework within which family choices are made, it is difficult to imagine why it should be reprimanded, especially as long as it does not work in opposition to basic rights. In fact, a government has a duty, and therefore a right, to carry through initiatives to the best of its cognitive and realizational abilities, for the sake of the higher aims which guide its life. But this is not all. When a government takes legislative steps in the area of means and services to favour responsible parenthood, it cannot forget that the question goes far beyond purely technical and particularly clinical aspects, since it concerns relations between the sexes, and between parents and children, family integrity, public morality, education, etc. In the same way a government which claims to operate in such a manner as to modify the fertility level of the popula? tion, and thus to act on other demographic parameters, must seriously consider all the consequences which can result from its action, in a number of directions. The technicalities of this analysis and the opportunity to create an on-going system of verification and control which could give timely warnings about necessary changes of direction, cannot be examined here. In this place one must remember the necessity to be careful not to break up or compromise, with badly-formulated pressures on fertility, values which are higher than those aimed at by the pressures themselves: mere material well-being cannot constitute the only, or even the pri? mary, criterion of reference when other deeply-felt human and moral values are in play, otherwise the psychic and cultural costs of the operation could perhaps outweigh the advantages in other directions. On the contrary, it must be added that, precisely because demographic policies never constitute an isolated moment in the process of government, all programmes of action on fertility must be preceded by a prudent comparison with the possibilities open for attaining by some other route all the desired objectives. It must be obvious that this specific type of government action is imperative, irreplaceable and something that cannot be postponed, if it is to be understood and if it is to persuade and to arouse agreement. This is so precisely because it intimately touches human sensibilities in those things which are most dear. A word should also be said concerning who it will be to make judgements</page><page sequence="33">33 and draw conclusions, but I consider that my opinion on the degree of participa? tion to be demanded from the entire social body has already been made suffi? ciently clear. Amongst the objectives that one would like to assign to a fertility policy is that of eliminating or toning down circumstantial oscillations which are super? imposed upon the evolutive tendency of births. It is a theme evoked, for example, in analyses and discussions of recent experience in economically developed coun? tries: I shall examine it first because it leads on into the maze of the problems with which we shall later be concerned. First of all let us consider that this ob? jective is seen from a different viewpoint than the one most suitable to the demographic field, orientated rather towards the long term. In the second place it is introduced against a background of uncertainties: what will ever be the optimum population for a given historical situation, what the optimum rate of demographic increase, will it be most convenient to witness a uniform rate in time, or is that not necessary, how can the latter be manoeuvred to arrive at the former? If we were able to answer queries of this nature, we should have a guide in operational terms. But what is to be done when for example a Kuznets, in the paper presented at the Belgrade Conference (10) writes: ?Given the variety of pos? sible qualifying conditions, it is difficult to establish unequivocal quantitative relations between demographic trends in numbers and quantitative aspects of economic growth.Thus, under some conditions higher rates of population - growth may, in the long run, induce higher rates of increase in per capita products: un? der others, lower; and quite often we cannot teil?? Then there is another line of opinion to be considered. Some people believe that it is difficult to level out circumstantial waves, others point out ex? perimental interventions which have been effective in the short term; on one side the expediency of concentrating attention on the modification of generational rather than of contemporary ways of behaving is underlined; on the other the immediate effectiveness of measures which, however, lose strength in the long run, through a type of ? psychological usury*, is stressed. Rightly emphasized then are the psychic costs that alternate enforcements following close one after another in opposite directions have on decisions that the couples make, endangering the eventual attainment of responsible parenthood which is certainly easier to achieve if backed up by a life plan than if enforced by a day to day arrangement. If moreover one takes into account the various kind of limits and obstacles ? like those we shall shortly see ? which interventions upon the procreative be? haviour of couples come up against, the idea of a counsel and an invitation to politicians seems to emerge: that they try to consider whether, for their aims of (10) S. KUZNETS, Demographic Aspects of Modern Economic Growth, Back? ground Paper A. 10/2/e/389, United Nations World Population Conference, Belgrade, 1965.</page><page sequence="34">34 equilibrium and well-being, it may not be better to move in a different direction, introducing instead greater elements of elasticity into the tissue of economic and social organization to put this into such conditions as to be able to absorb without too great a shock the various unfavourable effects of the changing number of births. In most industrialized countries today, reproductivity is not ensured, or was not until a short time ago. In some, deaths out-number births. A spreading preoccupation with this phenomenon is evident, and in some cases important innovations to encourage a rise in the birth rate have been introduced. These experiences, which are the repetition of previous ones with uncertain results, again underline how arduous it is to obtain notable results in this direction, how one must move on various levels, and how it is necessary to put into action a series of mechanisms aimed at stimulating behaviour which the law is certainly not capable of imposing. Well, one can wonder if, in these initiatives, problems appear which have some connection with human rights. This seems to be so, in my opin? ion, and I will give some examples. Among the instruments used is an increase in family allowances, with the evident purpose of sharing among the collectivity and the families the costs of the bringing up of children in a manner which is more favourable to families. There are cases in which the scale of the allowances, variable according to the order of birth of the children, is reduced above a certain parity to' a merely symbolic level. The intention to hinder the formation of large families is clear. Some people, even, theorize about specific reserves to be exploited, for example births of the third order, concentrating resources and investments on these. These solutions do not satisfy me. It seems to me that the responsible freedom of the partners, distributive justice, the real good of society, are better safeguarded by a system of allowances which increase, not only according to the number of children, but in proportion to the extra economic weight ? differing from one case to another ? that each new birth gives rise to, which is graduated as a function of the age reached by the children themselves, which ensures to each new-born child at least the indispensable minimum for his human development, which takes into account the evolution of the economic cycle of family income and outgoings over the years and in the unfolding of the family life cycle, and so on. Certainly this is a complex solution to complex requirements. But one must not impose in practice certain family sizes,' because, for example, they are adapted more easily than others to the typology set down by a building project for living accomodations. There is no need to turn back to genetics and to re? member the importance of the variability of the number of children per family for the adaptation to environment to appreciate the risks ? and the boredom ? of an unbroken uniformity. A single, abstract, ideal family size for a given society does not exist: instead a variety of individual disposition, realized and evolving</page><page sequence="35">35 in a framework of concrete situations, does. We shall quickly examine certain difficult problems which arise when the guidance of such autonomous dispositions is aimed at without hateful discriminations. Appreciable results in the inversion of birth tendencies have been obtained in cases in which restrictions on legal abortions have been included in the adopted policies. Certainly, I have no objection to make on this subject when modifications are the fruit of greater moral and civil awareness: I have already stated my posi? tion. I also accept the claim of the educational function of the law, to direct citizens along more humane paths. Finally, I understand the reasons put forward as a result of greater experience in the realm of the consequences on the health of the mother and later children. Much less do I appreciate, to say the least, the use of the valve of legislation on abortion as an instrument of manoeuvring demographic growth. Thus, I would be cautious in expressing any judgement on the weight of certain measures concerning extra-domestic work by women. I find commend? able any effort that society might make to ensure that women have the maximum possibility of freedom of choice: long maternity leaves and also leaves for the upbringing of the children, the possibility of not only keeping one's job but also of returning to it in equal conditions, and without sacrifices for the future develop? ment of one's career; working hours that are flexible and can be agreed upon; interesting solutions to part-time employment; suitable infrastructure support for assistance in infancy and pre-school cares, etc. I am less enthusiastic about social policies which press women to enter into professional activity, linking the improve? ment of living standards to the increase in the number of workers rather than to raising the earnings of the person who constitutes the family's main source of income. If we choose, in this field, first to grant benefits and then to withdraw or annul them, in practice laying the burden of attaining demographic objectives above all on the woman's condition, this would give me serious reservations. The scene is very different if, passing over the cases in which, more or less correctly, the demographic element is taken as a purely exogenous variable, we turn our attention to countries in which the reduction of the birth rate is not only encouraged, but set down as a necessary objective. Here we are entering a dense forest of problems of all kinds, and confront a firework display of ideas and initiatives. Following the thread of our theme, I shall pause once again on some most important and qualifying subjects. On the subject of responsible parenthood ? I am taking this as my starting-point ? one does not stop at satisfying spontaneous demands, but goes on to take promotional steps, in these cases. One begins with the idea that a high fertility rate need not be an answer to deliberate intentions, but may constitute a mere sequence of habits, an expression of stereotypes which do not correspond to fundamental needs, a result of ignorance, and so forth. The circulation of</page><page sequence="36">36 appropriate information would allow people to free themselves from the crys? tallized encrustations of a different era and, opening their eyes to new realities, would give rise to a type of behaviour more in line with them. The availability of adequate services would crown an arc of changes which rests upon voluntary bases. A not unimportant advantage of this approach would lie in the circumstance that the consequent reduction in the birth rate would be translated, above all, into a checking of ?unwanted? births, that is, of those who from the very be? ginning are disadvantaged by an unfavourable psychological climate. Such an outline is extremely simplified and hides very complex facts. Think ? to make a rather unusual example ? what it means to be given such knowledge as we now have about the fertile and unfertile days of the monthly cycle. What could before be taken as an obvious result in general, but unforeseeable in the particular instances, of a normal way of life, within the bounds of marriage, now makes itself felt in the more or less probable consequences of each single act. On the individual act, that is, rest hopes, weigh fears, are concentrated tensions of choices which are of enormous importance to the couple concerned. The need for a personal habit of responsible action is hence enormously amplified. More generally, it is never a question of mere instructive information and of providing technical assistance. Much deeper and more complex values and rela? tionships which it is imperative to understand and to confront, striving towards the formation of consciences, education in the full sense of the word, always enter into play. Above all, in my opinion, interpersonal relationships between the partners need further attention. Not, therefore, suggestions for evasions or tricks, but the confrontation with reality and the development of co-responsibility of each partner in the couple on an equal footing. I think that the promotion of the establishment of a more open dialogue between husband and wife might be the best path to draw greater attention to the needsv and condition of women in deci? sions about the children to be brought into the world. In this order of ideas, I might add that I can well understand efforts to find a contraceptive method that is ideal because it causes less disturbances and requires less continuous effort. I consider, however, that this does not exempt us from the need to simultaneously educate and form characters with a sense of responsibility, which in order to be deep and lasting must integrally embrace the human personality. The determined, aware application required for the exercising of responsibility in parenthood is hard to reconcile with levity of behaviour in sexual matters. After all, even the perfect method has no effect if forgotten at the right moment. Yet there is more to he said, because in the area of family, planning one does not limit oneself to these positions, of informing and providing service, dear to those who recognise in them the most civil road to the solution of certain demographic problems: one goes on to propaganda, to incentives, to pressure, as far as to forms of coercion. Before going any further, let us mention at least some of the criticisms, advanced by those of other ideological footings, against the</page><page sequence="37">37 initiatives that have been taken in this area. On various occasions these have been seen as a useful instrument of defence of the status quo, a substitute for indispen? sable social change, a covering of the interests of others, a swindle, a source of false hopes which is responsible for the evasion of what really counts to eradicate the evils of society, that is struggle and revolutionary catharsis. Such accusations annoy many people ? just as, on the other hand, others are disgusted by the praises sung of the outcomes of birth control campaigns when they see time series of sterilizations and abortions presented, together with other series, as indicators, not of abdications and tragedies, as they consider them to be, but of successes ?, but to ignore them would be a mistake. Apart from every other consideration, they encourage further investigations of our theme. In fact these criticisms put forward an implied query: when, to reduce procreation, one starts down the path of pressure of whatever type, who are the ones to foot the bill, and, on the other hand, who gains from the results? Are we dealing with the same families and the same groups of people, or with different groups and families because of a differential incidence of these actions on various parts of the social community? The central nucleus of the problem to be solved by governments worried by a too rapid demographic growth is that of satisfactorily reconciling the conse? quences of decisions taken autonomously, on the basis of particular interests and points of view, with the well-being of society as a whole, inclusive of the families responsible for those atomistic decisions. To such an end, the modification of the present division between families and collectivity of the costs to be supported in order to bring up the children, and of the benefits drawn from the latter, can be proposed. In using such terms I am certainly not alluding only to items quite easily translatable into the language of economic accountancy: I am well aware that others, indeed perhaps the most important, are not translatable. Once re? affirmed the principle that in no case is it permissible to transfer to others' should? ers burdens deriving from one's own disorderly behaviour and that, on the other hand, everyone has a duty to help those in a state of need through no fault of their own, it must also be said that often the conflict of interests ? or different ways of viewing these interests ? between isolated families and society is not clearly amainable to responsibilities of a moral order but rather are a result of innovatory facts and limited knowledge. In such circumstances re-stabilizing action, aimed at turning individual streams and the river of collective well-being back into the bed they share, has not even what little guidance might be gleaned from the evaluation of mistakes to be repaired and errors to be corrected. Consequently this action becomes very delicate and it comes up against at least two categories of difficulties. The first is that of the difficulties which arise because of the uncertainty weighing upon the outcomes-of decisions that might be taken, given the lack of knowledge on the subject. In the second place, and more especially, are those which arise because action taken can cause social effects which are contrary to what was intended.</page><page sequence="38">38 I must develop this last point, which is of fundamental importance. Even if a government limits itself to weighing its hand with thundering campaigns of propaganda, it is not acting impartially in relation to the rights and expectancies of the various social components; one could maintain that, in the end, the govern? ment pushes people to renounce one kind of good ? the joy which comes from children ? which is among the few in which the least favoured social categories are on a level with the others. Moreover, at least potentially, economic stimuli exercise a bad influence, under many headings: in the subordination to purchasing power of the exercising of a fundamental, inalienable right; in weighing heavily upon the already precarious situation of the poorest since they, in order to be effective, must be substantial; in the risk of leaving at the same comparative level of income those unfortunate classes to whom, on the other hand, is denied the gratification which comes from a family. What is even worse, in certain cases, by increasing poverty, they impose punishment not only and not so heavily on the parents, who may perhaps have acted less than responsibly, but also on the children who are born obviously innocent, and on their brothers. A type of social self destruction is the result, obliging the community to somehow face the problems that its members, placed since birth in pockets of emargination, cannot fail to cause. Even if, to impose limits upon their regressive influence, one wished to graduate rewards and punishments according to the subject's income, the basic objection, which has already been put forward, would not be overruled. In fact, what meaning can be given to a tax on children which increases with the order of birth and is scaled in its size according to family income, heavier for the rich, lighter for the poor? Or to a financial incentive in favour of those who have no other children ? at least for a certain length of time ? higher for the poor and lower for the rich? Let us leave aside all considerations about the actual possibility of using similar instruments on millions of people in the present state of administra? tive organization of many countries. Let us also ignore the fact that such methods risk accentuating corruption phenomena by constituting a further incentive to conceal one's own income. But let us take note of the fact that in substance they can be seen ? and further encouraged by the agreement of those concerned ? as an open road to overcoming one's own poor conditions. Essentially, in other words, the problem remains within the area of a barter between shortages of economic means and basic rights. Is this the right road to eradicating poverty, or is it not more correct to turn the fundations upside down in order to grant equality to everyone in the exercising of human rights? Is it not better to carry out economic and social changes which go towards fulfilling the basic needs of those lower down the social scale; which guarantee to everyone at least that minimum necessary for their human dignity and purpose; which ? by spreading education ? put everyone into the position of being able to benefit from the existing possibilities, without</page><page sequence="39">39 whidh efforts aimed at achieving greater social equality would fall into the void; etc. ? If we adopt this viewpoint, we must agree that a higher distributive justice is not merely to be considered a technique that promotes a reduction in births, but a condition that must be satisfied as a logical preliminary in order to be entitled to spur people on into pursuing it. If such a condition is not respected, the evocation of the fundamental right of responsible parenthood and also of the means and services needed to realize this lays itself open to the criticism that the category of man's rights is used for purposes which have little to do with them. A couple of words about the most excessive lines that are being talked about or are in force to control demographic increase: I am referring to proposals for agents to sterilize the whole population and connected licences to have child? ren, to sterilization and abortion made obligatory in certain conditions, to the breakdown and weakening of nuclear family ties, to the encouragement of homo? sexuality, to drastic restrictions in the number and the type of dwelling-places, to policies that in practice oblige women to work outside the home without even guaranteeing sufficient children's services, etc. From the point of view of essential rights, which is the one which is of interest here, there seems to be no doubt that these are unacceptable invasions into the sphere of personal liberty, or actions that cause serious harm to the dignity of man and to his rights to choose how to live his own life. Even when primary rights are not obviously cast aside, these policies are so severe as to impose the burden of proving their necessity, irre placeability, immediacy on those who carry them out: these people should always remember that the aim of public action is the well-being of human beings, not of capons in a coop. While in recent years a sense of delusion and frustration with family planning campaigns has mounted, and also uncertainty about which roads to take in the future, a different orientation is taking up more and more ground, putting in the foreground an indirect front of attack to the problems raised by demogra? phic dynamics. According to this train of thought, recourse to family planning at most eliminates ?unwanted? births, whatever interpretation might be given to this ambiguous expression. This is not sufficient to bring fertility to tolerable levels because in many societies the family size in fact desired still remains too large. Therefore it is necessary to aim at a modification of the basic motivations which underlie this behaviour. Such a modification, which among other things would facilitate the success of the aforementioned campaigns, is sought via changes in the socio-economic structure of the community: rationalization of work in the fields, according to the idea that a more rational attitude in important areas like the efforts to be made to conserve and improve the material conditions of one's own existence can also be transferred to the level of procreation; a change in the woman's condition in the family circle, and in society, with equal access to education and an entrance to alternative roles than domestic life; the assurance of the stability of employment as a guarantee of security for family fortunes;</page><page sequence="40">40 once again, progress in the equalization of incomes and of social positions: and so forth in the same vein. Stripped of certain exaggerations, this proves an inviting road which is certainly valid for its intrinsic merits, and which in every case is to be followed. But will the results come so quickly, and in such plenty, as is necessary? And what, then, are the most effective reforms, compatible from other points of view with essential rights? These questions need only be formulated for one to realize how much remains to be studied and discovered about this subject. I shall add that I am but little convinced ? at least in the forms in which it has been presented up till now by a nouvelle vague which seemed partly inspired by accounts of experiences in the People's Republic of China ? by that which is known by the term ?communalism?, that is the establishment on the level of small local groups of an autonomous community responsibility, united for a prog? ramme of procreation and development. This constant checking by neighbours ? not even by one's own family ? on most intimate decisions and relationships seems to me to be a form of coercion which is incompatible with safeguarding human rights, and is also less psychologically tolerable than a rough plan directly imposed by the central power, with which it would probably ultimately end in agreement on sanctions concerning the deviants from the system. The problem of the discovery of suitable ways of achieving a modification of the fertility level which would combine the maintenance of a wide family variability, reflecting the free choices of those concerned, with a reduction of the average level thus remains a totally open one. It is a current, shocking demonstra? tion of the eternal problem of the search for a system of social organization which conserves the ever fragile equilibrium between authority and the consensus of citizens. For an opportune solution, on /the level of the individual, it suggests a tendency towards the attainment of individual autonomy in conformity with the heteronomy of a social order which permits the maximum perfectioning of his own being to everyone. Without this personal tension, no organizational solution fitting for man, which is carried through by the State, can stand on its own feet. A similar conclusion would be reached by extending the argument to the world community ? substituting States for persons ?, with the further warning that, in the absence of the guidance and power of an authority that is above the State's, in practice all solutions are entrusted to the spirit of solidarity ? as well as, of course, to the contractual and political power, and to the brute force ? of the member countries alone. I say of the countries and not of the governors because, in a democratic regime, these could do nothing alone, without the support of the whole internal political body.</page><page sequence="41">41 WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD? In the dossier that he prepared for the benefit of the participants at the well-known Williamsburg Conference in 1952, John Hajnal quoted the range of estimates then current on the number of inhabitants that the earth could sustain: it went from 4 to 6 billion, that is, at the most, to 6 or 7 times the population at that time. In the document presented by the Secretariat of the United Nations at Bucharest on ?Population, resources and environment)) (E/CONF. 60/5) is written that the earth is potentially capable of giving food to 38 to 48 billion men, i.e. at least to almost ten times the population in 1974. A paper by the FAO, also included in the documentation of Bucharest (E/CONF.60/CBP/25), raises these last figures to 50 to 130 billion, in subordination to technological discoveries which can reasonably be considered as within our scope, such as the desaliniza tion of sea water so as to render irrigable the warm deserts.In the same study it is affirmed that we can go even further, provided that reference is made to diets which involve the transformation of less cereals through livestock.This is not enough: the limits would be moved even further outwards on the basis of non conventional foodstuffs which require less land for their production. Obviously, 130 billion means about 1000 inhabitants per km2 of emerged land, excluding the polar caps and Greenland. That is not to say all those people must always keep their feet on earthly soil. They could also live in librated cities in inter-planetary space. Think of the progress which has been made in less than 100 years in the flight of matter heavier than air. I mention this, not for the sake of sensationalism, but to provide a peep-hole to view the immense territories that the ability of homo sapiens opens out for us. This points to a world very different from the present one, but man has always dedicated himself to leaving his mark on and to fashioning new worlds, different from those he has found. However, another point must also be made. We today know that with a definitely normal procreation ? in fact, one surpassed by numerous populations ? combined with a control of mortality equal to that attained in the most developed countries, rhythms of demographic increase are achieved which appear unsustainable in the long run. Taking up an observation by Ansley Coale, in a length of time of the same order of magnitude as our historical period ?the mass of humanity would form a sphere expanding at the speed of light?. That is, on the basis of present knowledge, the future is coming to meet us swathed in darkness and the cloak of absurdity. The necessity for a stationary population appears today to be inescapable: in this, which many hope for and urge to be attained as soon as possible, I read a condemnation. I consider, in fact, the costs of stationarity which, with the aforesaid mortality and current nuptiality, signifies on average only about two children per family. I see in this the risk that within the family itself motives of tension become institutionalized. Jealousy can take root more easily between only</page><page sequence="42">42 two children. If they have come into the world over a short period of time, without older brothers who share their position and, in a certain sense, also partic? ipate in parental authority, the distance between parents and children can be accentuated and hence the danger of generational conflicts; if they are of very different ages, each may feel the psychological difficulties of the only child. In either case, the educational potentiality of the family seems to have deteriorated. On the crystalized structure of population weighs one of the greatest problems of modern society, the emargination suffered by the wide band of people who are getting on in years; and until at least 50 a constant excess of males is registered, so that there is the risk of some people seeing themselves denied monogamous marriage at the age most suitable for weddings. The world seems impoverished and life greyer. And we know that to these observations, which will be valid when a stationary state is reached gradually and smoothly, other sadder ones would be added and substituted in the case of drastic changes. Concerning such conclusions, I find completely indifferent the fact that, in the final reckoning, populations which do not assure their own reproduetivity, some of which are in regression, do not show any actual grave signs of suffering, that indeed, at least from an economic point of view, they are placed among those who are better off. At the most, some years hence, a historian may find himself in the situation of repeating with regard to them what Polybius alleged was amongst the causes of the decadence of Greece: ?Men, moved to arrogance, cupidi? ty, and sloth, no longer wished to contract marriage, or, if married, to raise offspring, keeping at most one or two children to leave them in wealth and dissolu? tion? (37, 4, 7). In fact, the tragedy is born from the lack of freedom of choice. Thousands of years' experience has taught us not to impose limits on man's creative capacities. But man, using these very capacities, seems to have built across the path in front of him a wall which we can now only conceive of as insurmountable: he seems to have chained his autonomy for an essential moment of his personal expression and existential experience, which is that of giving life to new beings and bringing them up to adulthood. In this advancing reality I can see arising much more exacting problems than those (although extremely serious) posed by the enormous inequalities existing on an international plane, or by present local conditions. They are problems which concern all mankind, who, to resolve them, will not be able to put his trust only in science and technology, but who will have to rediscover the moral value of imposing himself limits, and to make recourse to all his most deeply hidden spiritual energies. This will not be the last lesson that our discipline will have helped to give to modern man. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The author wishes to express his deepest gratitude to the IUSSP for kindly permitting this publication and, for their help, to several people. First,</page><page sequence="43">43 of all to Miss Rosemary Trembath who took the burden of most of the translation and generously continued her assistance in all the following phases; to Miss Pa? tricia Reed who completed the English version; to Prof. Ansley J. Coale and to Fathers Diarmuid Martin and John Molloy, who kindly did a job of editing which, besides clarifying technicalities, added further colour to the English text. The errors and ambiguities left, partly resulting from the difficulty of rendering a text originally conceived and written in Italian in another language, are all the responsibility of the author. SUMMARY Only too often ideology means fanaticism, intolerance, even violence, but the term can be used also to denote sets of preconceptions and presupposi? tions which act as a stimulus and a guide to scientific innovation, particularly in the field of social science. This sort of insight into the realities of life and the world is a contribution to knowledge and the search for truth, also in the field of human rights. These are taken in the paper as those rights whose infringe? ment constitutes a vulnus of the essential characteristics of human beings and those which assume the role of a basic safeguard of them. The meaning of the insistence on the human rights theme in the United Nations system is briefly touched upon, but the main effort is spent in trying to find a firm base for both fundamental rights and duties, shown as strictly and simmetrically linked. Various examples of population policies ? broadly defined as governmental interventions influencing demographic variables ? are then examined in the light of the basic principles laid down in the said effort. The fields taken up in succession for consideration are international and internal migration, mortality, marriage, fertil? ity in countries at different stages of demographic transition, and growth. Rather than trying an extensive coverage of the whole horizon, a line of critical and deep thought about typical problematic themes is preferred. One of the main conclu? sions which may be quoted is a statement according to which the problem remains wide open of discovering acceptable ways aiming at a modification of fertility patterns which combine a reduction of the average family size with the mainte? nance of its variability in order to respect free and responsible individual choices. How important and urgent this task is, is underscored by the observations advanced in the final section of the paper including a meditation on the limits that humanity appears to have imposed on itself.</page><page sequence="44">44 RIASSUNTO Fin troppo spesso il termine ideologia significa fanatismo, intolleranza e persino violenza, ma lo stesso pub essere usato anche per designare un insieme di atti conoscitivi pre-scientifici e di presupposti agenti come stimolo e guida per Finnovazione scientifica, in particolare nel campo delle scienze sociali.
