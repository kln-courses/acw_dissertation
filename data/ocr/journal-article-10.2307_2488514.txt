ROBINSON AND ELIZABETH WOLFE MORRISON New York University, Leonard N. Stern School of Business, 44 West 4th Street, New York, N Y 10012 Summary This study examines the relationship between violation of an employee's psychological contract and civic virtue behavior. A psychological contract is a set of beliefs regarding mutual obligations between employee and employer. One hundred twenty-six MBA alumni were surveyed at the time of hire (TI), and after 18 months (T2) and 30 months (T3) on the job. When employees felt that their employers had failed to fulfil employment obligations at T2, they were less likely to engage in civic virtue behavior at T3. There was evidence that this relationship was partly mediated by trust. These findings have impli- cations for research on OCB and for managers seeking to maintain employee citizenship behavior. Introduction Organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) refers to employee behavior that is extra-role, that promotes organizational effectiveness, and that is not explicitly recognized by an organization's reward system (Organ, 1988, 1990). It is widely believed that organizations could not survive unless employees were willing to occasionally engage in OCB (Barnard, 1938; Katz, 1964; Katz and Kahn, 1978). Katz argued that an organization unable to depend upon employee extra-role behavior is 'a very fragile social system' (p. 132) that will 'soon grind to a halt' (1964, p.269). Given the recognized importance of OCB, a growing body of research has attempted to understand why it occurs. The most well-replicated finding is a positive relationship between OCB and employee satisfaction (Bateman and Organ, 1983; Organ and Konovsky, 1989; Puffer, 1987; Witt, 1991). Organ (1990) argued that this relationship between OCB and satisfaction is primarily cognitive in nature, in that employees engage in OCB to the extent that they believe their organization is treating them fairly. Other factors that have been found to predict OCB include leadership style (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman and Fetter, 1990; Smith, Organ and Near, 1983), employee commitment (O'Reilly and Chatman, 1986), and a variety of work unit character- istics such as interdependence (Karambayya, 1990). Despite the numerous studies focused upon OCB, the relationship between OCB and the nature and status of the contract that exists between an employee and employer has thus far been overlooked. This lapse is surprising given that the very definition of OCB assumes the existence of an employee-employer contract. For example, in his initial development of the OCB construct, CCC 0894-3796/95/030289-10 Received 16 September 1993 ? 1995 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. Accepted 25 August 1994</page><page sequence="2">290 S. L. ROBINSON AND E. WOLFE MORRISON Organ defined organizational citizenship as 'a readiness to contribute beyond literal contractual obligations' (1988, p. 22). OCB, therefore, has been defined relative to the formal employee- employer contract. Specifically, it is any behavior that exceeds the contractual agreement between employee and employer. Another indication of the linkage between OCB and the employee-employer contract is the importance that OCB theory accords to the exchange relationship between employees and employers and to notions of reciprocity and equity. A basic premise of OCB theory is that employees engage in OCB only when they define their employment relationship as one based on social exchange (Moorman, 1991; Organ, 1990). A second premise of OCB theory is that employees engage in OCB to reciprocate their organization for equitable treatment, withholding OCB as an input when their employer provides inadequate outcomes (Organ, 1988, 1990). Social exchange, reciprocity, and equity are central concepts in the literature on employee-employer contracts (Farnsworth, 1982; Rousseau, 1989, 1990; Rousseau and McLean Parks, 1993). The central role that they play in the OCB literature highlights the fact that OCB occurs within a larger framework of an employee-employer contract. Thus, OCB theory has as its foundation the existence of an employee-employer contract. However, researchers have not addressed explicitly the relationship between the employee- employer contract and OCB. In this paper, we propose that issues related to this contract play a significant role in the elicitation and maintenance of citizenship behavior. Specifically, we focus on the role of psychological contract fulfilment on civic virtue, an organizationally-directed form of OCB. A contract perspective on OCB The concept of a psychological contract provides a useful conceptual bridge between the organiz- ational citizenship literature and the employment contract literature. A psychological contract is a set of beliefs held by a person regarding the terms of an exchange agreement to which that person is party. Beliefs about mutual employment obligations, as seen by either an employee or an employer, constitute a psychological contract with respect to the employee-employer relationship (Rousseau, 1989; Rousseau and McLean Parks, 1993). Each party to an employment relationship possesses a unique psychological contract (Levinson, 1962; Rousseau, 1989). The perceptual, individual nature of psychological contracts is their defining attribute, making them distinct from both formal written contracts and implied contracts (Weick, 1981). Psychological contracts are developed and executed through interactions between an employee and specific organizational agents such as recruiters, direct superiors, and human resource personnel (Shore and Tetrick, 1994). In the employee's mind, however, the contract exists between him or her and the organization. That is, employees hold beliefs concerning what the organization is obligated to provide and beliefs about how well the organization has fulfilled those obligations (Levinson, 1962; Rousseau and McLean Parks, 1993; Schein, 1980). In a sense, the organization takes on an anthropomorphic identity as a party to the psychological contract. This personifi- cation of organizations is most likely facilitated by the fact that organizations have legal, moral and financial responsibilities for the actions of their agents, and by the fact that organizational policies and precedents provide continuity regardless of the specific agents involved (Eisenberger, Huntington, Hutchison and Sowa, 1986). Understanding psychological contracts vis-a-vis employment relationships can enhance our understanding of OCB in several ways. First, the psychological contract perspective highlights the reciprocal nature of the employment relationship. The OCB literature focuses on ways in which employees may exceed their formal obligations. Yet employers have obligations as well, and like</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACTS AND OCB: THE EFFECT OF UNFULFILLED OBLIGATIONS 291 employees, they can fall short of, fulfil, or exceed those obligations. A contract perspective on OCB focuses attention on obligations and behaviors on both sides of the employee-employer relation- ship, thus broadening the scope of OCB research. An understanding of psychological contracts also provides a broader view of OCB by encompassing employment agreements that vary in their degree of formality. Organ (1988) suggested that OCB is behavior that goes beyond the formal employee-employer contract. The literature on psychological contracts, however, suggests that informal agreements between employees and employers are also very important in terms of affecting employees' attitudes and behavior (Rousseau, 1989). Hence, to fully understand OCB, it may be useful to consider not only behavior that goes beyond the formal contract, but also behavior that exceeds the informal contract. Relationship between psychological contracts and OCB The psychological contract literature suggests that an employee's beliefs regarding the terms and status of the employment contract will affect that employee's behavior with respect to the contract (Rousseau, 1989; Robinson and Rousseau, 1994). Drawing on this argument, we predict that employees' beliefs about the extent to which their organization has fulfilled its obligations to them will affect their citizenship behavior within the organization. More specifically, we predict that perceived contract fulfilment will impact OCB that is directed at the organization. Williams and Anderson (1991) make an important distinction between OCB that is directed at benefiting the organization and OCB directed at supervisors or co-workers that contributes only indirectly to the organization. Because the psychological contract consists of beliefs about obligations on the part of the organization rather than particular individuals, we expect that perceived violation of that contract will impact organizationally-directed OCB rather than OCB directed at supervisors or co-workers. That is, if employees perceive that the organiz- ation has violated the contract, they will try to reciprocate by reducing their contributions to the organization, in the form of reduced organizationally-directed OCB. Of the five dimensions of OCB identified by Organ (1988) altruism, conscientiousness, courtesy, sportsmanship, and civic virtue civic virtue is the one most clearly directed toward the organization. Civic virtue is defined as 'behavior on the part of an individual that indicates that he/she responsibly participates in, is involved in, or is concerned about the life of the company' (Podsakoff et al., 1990). Thus, we hypothesize that fulfilment of the psychological contract will influence employees' civic virtue behavior. We predict that employees will engage in civic virtue if they feel their organization has fulfilled or surpassed its obligations, and withhold that behavior if they feel those obligations have not been adequately met, or in other words, if the psychological contract has been violated. This reflects the fact that citizenship behavior occurs within a context where employees believe 'that contributions will be reciprocated and that ... actions of one party are bound to those of another' (Rousseau, 1989, p. 128). Hi: Civic virtue will be reduced to the extent that employees believe that the obligations comprising their psychological contract have been unfulfilled by their employer. The above prediction can be understood from a justice perspective. For example, psychological contract violation may result in perceptions of distributive injustice or inequity (Adams, 1965). Civic virtue is an input that employees provide to their organization in exchange for the outputs that they receive (Organ, 1988). If employees believe their organization has provided insufficient outputs, by not fulfilling the terms of the employment agreement, they will be less willing to provide the organization with discretionary inputs. Psychological contract violation also raises issues of procedural justice (Lind and Tyler, 1988), which focuses on the fairness of process and</page><page sequence="4">292 S. L. ROBINSON AND E. WOLFE MORRISON how one is treated rather than on the fairness of outcomes. As Moorman (1991) demonstrated, perceptions of procedural justice play a significant role in determining OCB. To behave as good organizational citizens, employees must feel that they are respected and treated fairly. Since failure to honor a contract typically creates feelings of deception and betrayal (Rousseau, 1989), it is likely to create perceptions of unfair treatment or procedural injustice, and thus diminish the motivation for engaging in civic virtue. Our second prediction is that the relationship between perception of contract violation and civic virtue will be mediated by trust. As noted by Rousseau and McLean Parks (1993), when one party feels that the other has failed to fulfil a contractual agreement, it undermines the good faith and trust that created the contract in the first place. Once trust is destroyed, the violated party feels less bound to the relationship, and is thus less likely to engage in OCB, as he or she has grounds for doubting whether extra-role contributions will ever be reciprocated (Rousseau, 1989). Thus, we expect unfulfilled obligations to reduce employee trust, and in turn, we expect loss of trust to curtail civic virtue behavior. H2: The relationship between civic virtue and perceived contract violation will be mediated by trust. Finally, we predict that the relationship between civic virtue and perceptions of contract violation will be stronger to the extent that the obligations or promises comprising the psychologi- cal contract are explicit. The more explicit the promises made, the more certain employees will be that a particular contract exists (Rousseau, 1989), and the more violated employees will feel when those obligations are unfulfilled. When obligations are implicit, employees may attribute lack of fulfilment to miscommunication or misperception rather than to a deliberate act of betrayal on the part of their employer. H3: Explicitness will moderate the negative relationship between contract violation and civic virtue such that the more explicit the obligations, the stronger the relationship. Method Sample Respondents were 126 MBA alumni of a midwestern business school. Thirty-four per cent were women. Upon completion of the study, the average age of the participants was 30 years (S.D. = 2.01) and the mean number of years of full-time work experience was 6.29 years (S.D. = 1.78). Average salary was $69 200, ranging from $25 000 to $160 000. The respondents worked in a wide variety of industries: consulting (23.5 per cent), food and kindred products (17.5 per cent), chemicals and allied products (13.7 per cent), financial services (18.6 per cent) machinery (5.5 per cent), electronic equipment (3.3 per cent), transportation equipment (3.3 per cent), wholesale and retail trade (2.7 per cent), petroleum and energy products (2.7 per cent) and others (9.2 per cent). Procedure Respondents were surveyed three times. The first survey was administered shortly after the respondents had accepted job offers. All 264 MBA seniors who had accepted job offers by the time the survey was administered were asked to complete the survey in return for a chance to win a cash prize. Two hundred and eighteen, or 83 per cent, responded.</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACTS AND OCB: THE EFFECT OF UNFULFILLED OBLIGATIONS 293 The second survey was administered 18 months later to the 218 respondents of the first survey. The surveys were mailed to home addresses and self-addressed stamped envelopes were provided so that respondents could return their completed surveys directly to the researcher. As an incentive for participating, participants were promised a feedback report of the study. A reminder letter was sent two weeks after the survey was mailed and handwritten notes encouraging participation were sent two weeks after that. One hundred and eighty-four completed surveys were returned, and six were returned undelivered due to changes in address (response rate of 87 per cent). Finally, a third survey was mailed 12 months after the second to the 184 remaining participants. Again, reminder letters were sent after two and four weeks. One-hundred and sixty-four completed surveys were returned, and four were returned undelivered, for a response rate of 91 per cent. Respondents who had not remained in the same employment relationship for the duration of the study (n = 38) were excluded from the analyses. Thus, the overall sample size for the analyses was 126. Measures The first survey assessed the explicitness of the obligations comprising the psychological contract that respondents had established with their new employer during the recruitment process. The second survey assessed respondents' perceptions of how well their employer had fulfilled those obligations. The third survey measured respondents' trust in their employer and their civic virtue citizenship behavior. Explicitness of obligations The first survey assessed the explicitness of the promises comprising the employees' psychological contracts. Respondents were provided with the following list of promises: promotion and ad- vancement, high pay, pay based on current level of performance, training, long-term job security, and career development. They were asked to indicate, using a 5-point scale (1 = 'very implicit'; 5 = 'very explicit'), how explicitly their employers had promised each of the six items. The list of promises was taken from Rousseau (1990) and has been used in several studies of psychological contracts (Robinson, Kraatz and Rousseau, 1994; Robinson and Rousseau, 1994; Rousseau, 1990). Based on interviews with human resource managers from 13 engineering, accounting and manufacturing firms, Rousseau (1990) identified these as the most common promises made by employers during the recruitment process. Psychological contract violation On the second survey, respondents were asked to indicate their perceptions of whether their employer had fulfilled the promises comprising their psychological contract. Respondents were provided with the same list of promises described above and were asked to indicate the degree to which their employers had fulfilled or failed to fulfil each of them. They used a 5-point scale (1 = 'not at all fulfilled'; 5 = 'very well fulfilled'), placing an 'X' beside those items that their employer had never promised to fulfil. Responses were reverse scored so that a high score indicated contract violation. Trust Trust in one's employer was measured at time 3 using a scale developed by Robinson and Rousseau (1994). The scale contained seven items reflecting the bases of trust identified by Gabarro and</page><page sequence="6">294 S. L. ROBINSON AND E. WOLFE MORRISON Athos (1978). Sample items include 'In general, I believe my employer's motives and intentions are good' and 'I can expect my employer to treat me in a consistent and predictable fashion'. Participants used a 5-point scale, ranging from 'strongly agree' to 'strongly disagree'. Civic virtue Civic virtue was measured at time 3 with a measure designed by Podsakoff et al. (1990). Participants were presented with a list of five statements and were asked to indicate how characteristic each of the five statements was of their own behavior at work. Responses were on a five-point scale (1 = 'very uncharacteristic'; 5 = 'very characteristic'). Sample items are 'I attend functions that are not required, but that help the agency/company image' and 'I "keep up" with developments in the agency/company'. Results The items assessing psychological contract violation were factor analyzed (principal components with a varimax rotation). Consistent with previous research (Robinson et al., 1994; Robinson and Rousseau, 1994; Rousseau, 1990), two factors emerged. The first factor had an eigenvalue of 2.83 and explained 47.2 per cent of the variance. It included the following obligations: high pay, pay based on current level of performance, and promotion and advancement. Rousseau (1990) referred to the items comprising this factor as transactional obligations, because she argued that they are specific and quid pro quo in nature, contingent on the employee's inputs to the organiz- ation. The second factor had an eigenvalue of 1.23, explained 20.5 per cent of the variance, and included the following: long-term job security, career development, and training. Rousseau (1990) referred to these obligations as relational in that they serve to maintain the employee-employer relationship and are not based on quid pro quo exchange. The same factor structure was found for the items assessing contract explicitness. Based on the factor analysis results, items were summed to create two measures of perceived violation, reflecting violation of the transactional components of the psychological contract and violation of the relational components of the psychological contract. Items were also summed to create two measures of explicitness. Descriptive statistics for these and the other scales are presented in Table 1.

As shown in Table 1, both perceived violation of relational obligations and perceived violation of transactional obligations at T2 were negatively correlated with civic virtue at T3. To test the hypothesis, civic virtue was regressed simultaneously on the two violation measures. As shown in Table 2, perceived contract violation at 18 months explained a significant amount of variance in civic virtue one year later (R2 0.09; F= 6.22; p &lt; 0.001), although only the coefficient for relational violation was significant (I = -0.22; p &lt; 0.01). This provides support for hypothesis 1. Hypothesis 2 predicted that trust would mediate the relationship between civic virtue and psychological contract violation. According to Baron and Kenny (1986), mediation is demon- strated when (a) the independent variable has an effect on the proposed mediator, (b) the independent variable and the proposed mediator both have an effect on the dependent variable when considered separately, and (c) the independent variable's effect on the dependent variable is less when the mediator is in the equation than when the mediator is not in the equation. As can be seen in Table 2, all three of these conditions are met with respect to violation of relational obligations. The violation measures at T2 were negatively related to trust at T3 (R2 = 0.11; F= 7.18; p &lt; 0.001), and both violation and trust had independent effects on civic virtue at T3. More importantly, when civic virtue was regressed on both trust and the two violation measures, trust had a significant effect (f = 0.22; p &lt; 0.01), and the effect for relational violation was no longer significant (I = -0.16; n.s.). This provides evidence that trust mediated the relationship between relational violation and civic virtue. Hypothesis 3 predicted that explicitness would moderate the relationship between psychological contract violation and civic virtue. To test this, moderated regression analysis was performed. Civic virtue was first regressed on the two violation measures, the two explicitness measures, and trust. In the next step, interaction terms were added to the equation. As reported in Table 2, the explicitness of relational obligations had a significant effect (f = -0. 19; p &lt; 0.05) but neither of the interaction terms had effects that were significant, and neither the addition of explicitness nor the addition of the interaction terms explained a significant amount of additional variance. Thus, hypothesis 3 was not supported.</page><page sequence="8">296 S. L. ROBINSON AND E. WOLFE MORRISON Discussion Our results provide evidence that when employees believe that their employer has not fulfilled the terms of the employment contract, they are less likely to engage in organizationally-directed citizenship behavior. Specifically, employees were less likely to report displaying civic virtue behavior when they felt that their organization had failed to provide promised relational obli- gations such as career development and training. Further, this relationship was mediated by trust. According to MacNeil (1985), relational obligations, which are focused on maintaining the long-term relationship between employer and employee, entail a variety of socio-emotional concerns such as trust and beliefs in good faith and fair dealings. It has been argued that when such obligations are unmet, these feelings and beliefs are likely to erode (Robinson and Rousseau, 1994). Our results provide support for this, and indicate that the erosion of trust and good faith diminish an employee's willingness to engage in citizenship behavior directed at the organization. One way to understand these results is from the perspective of procedural justice. Violation of a promise might be considered a form of unfair treatment, in the sense that the injustice is rooted in the act of betrayal rather than the outcome per se. Thus, it might be a sense of betrayal or unfair treatment that leads to the erosion of trust, and hence, the erosion of organizationally-directed OCB. Another way to understand these results is from a distributive justice or equity perspective. Employees attempt to maintain an equitable balance between their contributions and what they receive from their organization. When they believe their organization has failed to provide sufficient outputs, by not fulfilling promised obligations, they may withhold their discretionary inputs. These interpretations, which are speculative, warrant further investigation. The results of this study highlight the value of considering the psychological contracts held by employees when studying OCB. One advantage of doing so is that it highlights the fact that OCB occurs within the context of a unique and reciprocal exchange relationship. OCB research typically implies that what constitutes extra-role behavior, as opposed to in-role behavior, is clearly defined and the same across employees. Morrison (1994), however, found the boundary between in-role and extra-role behavior to be ill-defined and to vary from one employment relationship to another. She argued that different employers have different requirements for their employees, and that employees themselves hold different definitions of in-role and extra-role behavior. Because a basic assumption of the literature on psychological contracts is that each employee, and each employer, has a unique perception of the obligations comprising the employment relationship (Rousseau, 1989), a psychological contract perspective may encourage researchers to consider the relation- ship-specific nature of OCB. Consequently, this perspective may lead to a better understanding of such behavior. Another advantage of considering psychological contracts when studying OCB is that the psychological contract literature highlights the two-way nature of employee-employer relation- ships. Thus, it encourages researchers to consider not only extra-role behavior on the part of employees, but also extra-role behavior on the part of employers. Organizations may exceed their obligations to employees in a variety of ways: by providing bonuses based on growth in profits, by hosting social events for employees, or by sponsoring employees for a triathalon, a costly medical surgery, or a sabbatical. Equity theory suggests that employees will seek to keep their contri- butions and their employers' contributions relatively equitable (Adams, 1965). Hence, we would expect employees to match the contract behavior of their employers. Employees will engage in extra-role behavior to the extent that their organization performs extra-role behavior. Conversely, it is likely that contract violation on the part of an employer will lead to contract breach, or sub-role behavior, on the part of employees. This is an interesting, but thus far neglected, topic for research.</page><page sequence="9">PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACTS AND OCB: THE EFFECT OF UNFULFILLED OBLIGATIONS 297 Despite its contributions, an important limitation of this study is that the variables were measured with self-reports. Consequently, the observed relationships may have been artificially inflated as a result of employees' tendencies to respond in a consistent fashion to the questions assessing contract fulfilment, trust and civic virtue behavior. We tried to minimize common- method bias, however, by collecting our independent and dependent variables a year apart. Although we could have reduced common-method bias further by obtaining supervisor ratings of OCB, we believed that this would have significantly reduced our sample size. Even more import- antly, it may have biased our results. It seems reasonable to expect that if employees had to ask their supervisors to provide ratings of their OCB, those employees with good relationships with their supervisors would have been more likely to comply. Nevertheless, we suggest that our results be interpreted in light of the potential for common-method bias. We also suggest that future research on the relationship between psychological contract violation and OCB try to obtain supervisor or peer reports of the latter. Finally, the results of this study have important practical implications. They suggest that employers should attempt to understand how employees perceive the obligations within the employment relationship. By understanding employees' perceptions of what they as employers are obligated to provide, they may avoid inadvertently violating those obligations. Further, if employers understand the psychological contracts held by their employees, they can try to alter the terms of those contracts if circumstances arise that make it impossible to fulfil promised obli- gations or if it becomes clear that misperception or miscommunication has occurred. By under- standing, and more importantly, attempting to manage, perceived obligations, organizations will be better able to ensure that their employees engage in OCB. This is critical, as organizations depend on OCB in order to run smoothly and effectively (Barnard, 1938; Katz, 1964; Katz and Kahn, 1978). This paper provides an initial glimpse at how OCB is affected by employees' psychological contracts. Additional research will help to further elucidate this relationship. References Adams, J. S.
