<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Military Architecture of Francesco di Giorgio in Southern Italy MICHAEL S. A. DECHERT, AIA Stowell-Dechert/Associates The role ofFrancesco di Giorgio (1439-1501) in developing theforms of artillery fortification marking the transition from late medieval de- fenses to the mature bastionedforts of the 16th century is becoming clearer as additional research has enhanced our knowledge of the chro- nology of his interventions, the maturation of design elements, and the interlocking personal, institutional, and political factors in his work for the Aragonese Kingdom of Naples. These efforts by Francesco di Giorgio and his associatesfocused on Naples, Otranto, Gallipoli, Ta- ranto, Manfredonia, Monte Sant'Angelo, Reggio Calabria, Ortona, Matera, and Brindisi. Archival sources, investigation of the sites, and surviving graphic materials contribute substantially to identifying this "school" of military architects and the evolution of design brought about by the technological challenge of gunpowder, firearms, and siege artillery. FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO MARTINI'S military architecture in the Aragonese Kingdom of Naples is an attractive object of investigation because of the extraordinary resources put at his disposal and the magnitude and originality of his fortresses, primarily in Naples and the Puglie. In an effort to locate Fran- cesco di Giorgio's work for the Aragonese crown in southern Italy, I used a multifaceted approach-employing archival sources, published correspondence and documents, and previous attributions in secondary sources. Field work in southern Italy involved several extended visits between 1982 and 1988, and included detailed site investigations. A correlation of design elements in extant structures with the content of Francesco di Giorgio's surviving Trattati and Taccuino, especially the draw- ings, coupled with documentary sources, reinforced attributions made by previous authors and permitted the identification of additional major works. Italian Military Engineering (Corpo del Genio Militare) aerial surveys for all major sites provided in- valuable information and permitted positive identification of two sites (Matera and Ortona) through their correlation with Francesco di Giorgio's early fortification plans. In this article I shall review previous studies of Francesco di Giorgio's work in southern Italy, emphasizing the castles of Otranto, Gallipoli, and Taranto. New material will clarify the relationship between design elements at Gallipoli and Taranto and parallel presentations in the Trattati. The design parallels JSAH XLIX: 161-180. JUNE 1990 between Gallipoli and Francesco di Giorgio's bastion designs for Loreto are indicated. This study expands the evidence con- firming Pane's general ascription of the castle at Brindisi to Francesco di Giorgio, based on tower design elements, as well as Volpe and DeVita's attribution of Monte S. Angelo to Fran- cesco di Giorgio, based on similarities between this structure and his known work at Fossombrone. The discussion of Man- fredonia, Reggio Calabria, Matera, and Ortona is new. Francesco di Giorgio and the evolution of Renaissance military architecture The activity of Francesco di Giorgio (1439-1501) as military architect and theorist covers the period when the technology and application of artillery and gunpowder entirely changed the conduct of war and sieges. Little is known of Francesco di Giorgio's early years. He grew up and trained in Siena. He studied painting there, but his fascination with and skill in mechanical arts and military architecture were also being de- veloped. Francesco di Giorgio had two masters, or at least men- tors, who influenced him profoundly: Lorenzo di Pietro, called "il Vecchietta" (1412-1480), and Mariano Jacopo, called "il Taccola" (died c. 1458). The former was a leading Sienese painter who worked as a military architect for the Sienese state and participated in the fortification of Orbetello, Talamone, and Monteagutolo. Francesco di Giorgio may have accompanied Lorenzo di Pietro in 1467 to visit and work on the castle of Sarteano.1 Mariano Jacopo was an engineer and master of me- chanical arts whose designs for machines for war and peace were annotated and copied by Francesco di Giorgio.2 Francesco di Giorgio was drawn to the field of military architecture from an early age and was confronted with the seemingly insolvable new problems presented by increasingly accurate and powerful siege artillery. 1.

Francesco di Giorgio, tower and bastion designs from Magli- bechiano II.I.141, fol. 53v (left column) and fol. 54r (bottom right), and castle design employing almond-shaped bastions from Saluzziano 148, fol. 4r (tracings by author). Medieval fortification had been characterized by relatively thin and high masonry walls and tall towers, crowned by crenel- lations and machicolations, capable of dominating the towns and countryside they occupied. Artillery demonstrated the fra- gility of these structures. Furthermore, the medieval castle did not have the means of protecting all of its own perimeter, due to the geometry of its towers and walls. Nor did it have the means to project force substantially beyond its perimeter. Me- dieval castles and fortifications were "static." The principles of the new artillery-oriented fortification incorporated the follow- ing elements: a plan or trace that left no "dead space" in which an enemy might approach a tower or wall unimpeded; a stout, spacious platform or structure capable of resisting artillery fire and accommodating cannon for "active defense"; moats, walls, and barriers capable of deterring escalading troops; and, finally, the adoption of the glacis, ravelins, demilunes, and other out- works controlling the approaches to castles and major fortifi- cations. Francesco di Giorgio's activity and personal development as a military architect are traceable through his many drawings and the castles he designed. His association with Duke Federico da Montefeltro, the famous condottiere from Urbino, whom he served as court architect starting in the 1470s, encouraged his quest for effective artillery defenses. Francesco di Giorgio's style or approach to military architec- ture may be called transitional. That is, he developed an archi- tectural vocabulary grounded in the medieval tradition of high walls, large round and polygonal towers, and a sensitivity, both aesthetic and functional, to the topography, terrain, and sur- rounding structures of the sites, often urban, for which he de- signed castles. At the same time, he addressed the new conditions of warfare by developing fortifications that eliminated the vul- nerabilities of dead space on the enceinte through his use of polygonal plans, acute angles, and bastions and angular towers resistant to and incorporating artillery. He also established broad moats protected by ground-level artillery positions embedded in the towers and walls (called casemates), and by outworks extending some distance away from the principal line of defense. Francesco di Giorgio often combined angular and circular forms in his enceintes (Fig. 1). The circular towers had better deflective characteristics, while the angular shapes left no blind spaces on the enceinte. His towers are largely composed of flared (battered) bases topped by projecting stone cordons, upon which sit vertical walls that are often surmounted by machicolations and crenel- lations. The proportions of the towers are squat. They are largely backfilled, to increase their resistance to artillery. The battered base increases the stability of the towers and walls. Loopholes for firearms are found invariably at the parapet and at the inside corners of the towers, so that enfilading fire could be brought to bear along the adjacent enceinte walls. This description is valid for nearly all Martinian (the term is used to indicate char- acteristic stylistic elements of Francesco di Giorgio) circular towers and most of his angular bastions.3 Although he used circular and angular or diamond-shaped towers, he also devel- oped a crossbreed, the "almond" tower. This form, composed of two intersecting arcs, had deflective characteristics of the 3. This tower description is not quite unique to Francesco di Giorgio. The design seems to appear in the 1450s and 1460s. The circular towers at the castle of Sarteano, where Lorenzo di Pietro and, according to Dezzi-Bardeschi, probably Francesco di Giorgio, worked, have precisely this configuration. The major instances where this wall design is em- ployed by architects other than Francesco di Giorgio are the Rocca Costanza in Pesaro by Luciano Laurana, the castle of Senigallia by Baccio Pontelli, the Rocca di Imola, and the castle of Volterra, the last two based on the design advice of Federico da Montefeltro. These are all buildings of the 1470s. This design seems to have developed prin- cipally in Romagna and Urbino in the courts of Federico da Montefeltro and his allies. Francesco di Giorgio designed more defensive structures and castles using this motif than any other architect. It was subsequently adopted and modified by Baccio Pontelli and Giuliano da Sangallo. (See G. Severini, Architettura militare di Giuliano da Sangallo, Pisa, 1970.) Fol. 53v of the Magliabechiano II.I.141 illustrates designs for many forms of towers. Nearly all fortress drawings in the Trattati provide tower designs characterized by this motif.</page><page sequence="3">DECHERT: THE MILITARY ARCHITECTURE OF FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO 163 circular plan without its "dead space" unreachable by enfilading fire. He even connected circular and angular forms to make composite towers. Francesco di Giorgio experimented with numerous forms and combinations in a manner unique to him and to this transitional period. It was ultimately Antonio da Sangallo the Elder, at Nettuno in 1501, who simplified fortification design by system- atically employing the angle bastion at projecting corners of the defensive enceintes, thus initiating the mature form of artillery fort that would characterize fortifications for the next 250 years. Francesco di Giorgio's designs surpass the medieval forms of the early and mid-15th century. His thought experiments found expression in the drawings of the Taccuino and Trattati and some of these were realized in built works, of which some, in turn, were actually tested in siege warfare, usually with success, as at San Leo, Sassocorvaro, and Taranto. The fact that most of the built works were not attacked suggests their success as deterrents. The state of research on Francesco di Giorgio and southern Italian military architecture The scholarship devoted to Francesco di Giorgio and his activities in the Aragonese Kingdom of Naples reveals two dis- tinct approaches. The first, relying upon archival research and documentation, has concentrated on Francesco di Giorgio as theorist and practitioner in the Aragonese court in Naples. The second approach has relied mainly on site studies of the many castles and fortifications with which he is associated in southern Italy, principally in the Puglie, an area rich in Norman, Angevin, and Aragonese structures. Such interest has focused on the ele- ments of design in these castles and their evolution, both tech- nical and aesthetic, in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Unfortunately, the destruction of archival materials of southern Italy during World War II has made the search for attributions of the built works marking this critical passage in architectural history very difficult, and many attributions to Francesco di Giorgio have been made only on the evidence of the most general stylistic similarities and the knowledge that the Ara- gonese court granted him broad authority to design and develop fortress defense systems. Problems of attribution and dating are compounded by the fact that military architecture is a field notable for its investments of massive resources combined with considerable secrecy, and hence some degree of anonymity for its practitioners. Most scholarly attention on Francesco di Giorgio's military architecture has focused on his role as court architect to Federico da Montefeltro and the fortifications described in the Trattati, particularly those in the territory of Urbino. Indeed, this focus of interest continues to the present.4 More general works, largely 4. See E. Rocchi, Le origini della fortificazione moderna, Rome, 1894; idem, "Francesco di Giorgio Martini nelle tradizioni dell'ingegneria militare italiana," Bollettino senese della storia patria, IX, 1902; idem, Le dealing with the major lines of development in the theory and design of fortification, concentrate primarily on developments in central and northern Italy.5 Modern research on Francesco di Giorgio's activity in south- ern Italy began with the publication, by Gaye, during 1839 and 1840 of some of his correspondence with Alfonso, the Duke of Calabria (later Alfonso II).6 Promis, who published Francesco di Giorgio's Trattati in 1841,7 glossed the text and provided the first systematic commentary on the life and works of the ar- chitect, including remarks about his activities in the Puglie and at Otranto in particular.8 In the 1850s, Milanesi dramatically expanded our appreciation of Francesco di Giorgio's role in the court of Naples with the publication of documents relating to Sienese artists.9 Toward the end of the last century, Percopo, researching the Treasury accounts of the Aragonese crown, published numerous fonti storiche dell'architettura militare, Rome, 1908; L.

All these authors have recognized in Aragonese military architecture the presence of certain transi- tional design elements and "proto" bastions created as a response to siege artillery. Moreover, the literature generally emphasizes the probable role of Francesco di Giorgio as the designer and theorist responsible for these creations. Francesco di Giorgio in southern Italy: a chronology The chronology of Francesco di Giorgio's activity in the service of the Aragonese Kingdom of Naples remains quite uncertain. It is thought that Francesco di Giorgio probably met Alfonso, Duke of Calabria, who was an ally of Urbino and Siena, during the campaign of 1478 against Florence. At that time, Francesco di Giorgio served as court architect and engineer of Federico da Montefeltro.23 However, Francesco di Giorgio may have known Alfonso earlier, because the Duke of Calabria had organized Sienese military campaigns since 1468, often in collaboration with Federico da Montefeltro.24 The first com- missions that we know Francesco di Giorgio received from the Court of Naples were for small works of art and a painting, for which he received payment in 1479.25 Work by Francesco di Giorgio on fortifications in Naples or southern Italy is not reported until 1484. Salazar published a description of King Ferrante's laying of the cornerstone of the new walls of Naples on 15 June 1484, in which Francesco di Giorgio is mentioned as "chief engineer."26 In 1491-1492, there was substantial correspondence between Alfonso, Francesco di Giorgio, and the Sienese authorities, including requests for the architect's services, laudatory recommendations, and expressions of thanks.7 In letters dated 12 October and 23 November 1492, 20.

In the letter of 24 March 1493, the Duke of Calabria writes, "When you are with us, you will be at our side at your pleasure, and without fatigue and without necessity for work in the field, though you will advise and regulate the construction managers by written or verbal instructions and drawings."30 This indicates that Fran- cesco di Giorgio would have worked as the chief designer and coordinator of defensive construction for, and in the name of, the Duke of Calabria, principally out of a single location, send- ing instructions and drawings to works managers in a manner not unlike that of a modern architect or consulting engineer. In 1494, Charles VIII invaded the Kingdom of Naples. Alfonso II abdicated in favor of his son Ferrandino, who retained Fran- cesco di Giorgio as his military architect. Ferrandino succeeded in retaking Naples, but the Castel Nuovo remained in French hands until Francesco di Giorgio and his colleague Antonio Marchesi tunneled beneath the defensive perimeter. The det- onation of gunpowder within the tunnel on 27 November 1495 breached the defenses. The ensuing assault retook the Castel Nuovo.31 On 13 March 1497, the King of Naples wrote to Siena and requested that the architect return.32 The text of the letter indicates that Francesco di Giorgio was in Naples and southern Italy for at least some time in 1496 and early 1497. At this point, the trail of correspondence ends and Francesco di Giorgio's further role, if any, in southern Italy becomes un- known.

The fortifications of Otranto, Gallipoli, and Taranto: previous research and new evidence The association of Francesco di Giorgio with fortifications in the Puglie was originally made on the basis of studies of the castles of Gallipoli and Taranto and of the fortifications of Otranto. Bacile di Castiglione, in an article about the city walls and castle of Otranto (Fig. 2), noted that the Duke of Urbino sent a military architect by the name of Ciro Ciri33 to Alfonso, Duke of Calabria, in order to assume direction of the siege of Otranto in May 1481. The siege was successful, and the Turks were expelled. It is assumed that Ciri was also the architect and designer of the subsequently reinforced defensive works at Otranto, but this is not documented.34 Bacile di Castiglione believed that Francesco di Giorgio visited Otranto and made design recommendations in the course of a tour of the Puglie defenses in 1492. He points to the design of the Porta Alfonsina as reflecting principles of entry and massing characteristic of Francesco di Giorgio.35 Pane subsequently made the observation that the Porta Alfonsina at Otranto is nearly identical in plan to the medieval Porta di Capua at Naples, which was well known to Francesco di Giorgio.36 The gates at Naples and Otranto are not half towers, but rather three-quarter towers joined by 33. Ciro Ciri is probably the same person as Paolo Scirri of Castel Durante, a military architect who, presumably, trained in the Court of Urbino under Francesco di Giorgio and Federico da Montefeltro. Vir- tually nothing is known of his career; however, he was later in the service of the d'Este family, for whom he carried out fortification work in the territory of Ferrara; see B. Zevi, Saper vedere l'urbanistica: Ferrara di Biagio Rossetti, la prima cittd moderna europea, Turin, 1960, 157. 34. Bacile di Castiglione, "Le mura e il castello di Otranto," 2; J. Albini, De gestis Regum Neapolitani, Naples, 1589, 219, reports that the crown of Naples thanked the Duke of Urbino for sending Ciri, who had recaptured Otranto and taught the Neapolitans much regarding siege warfare through his drawings and instructions. 35.

In addition to the Porta Alfonsina, there are two towers on the enceinte and three for- tress towers that reveal massing and modeling similar to his designs in the Trattati and built works in the Marche: battered base, stone cordon, straight end section, machicolations, and squat proportions. Gallipoli attracted the attention of Bacile di Castiglione, who saw a direct application of a major Martinian design element depicted in the Magliabechiano II.I.141, that is, a great circular tower at the end of two converging walls (Fig. 3).37 The town of Gallipoli is built on a small projection from the mainland, whose landward side is protected by water and by an older castle, roughly square in plan, from which project converging walls ending at a great tower (Fig. 4). The Duke of Calabria began to rebuild the castle in 1492, but the Turkish threat and the revolt of the southern Italian barons redirected most construc- tion resources to Taranto.38 The great new tower of the recon- structed fortification at Gallipoli has a profile similar to the Aragonese towers at Otranto and Taranto. There is no docu- mentation indicating which architects were involved in the re- construction of the fortress. None of the studies of Gallipoli has noted the striking similarity of the projecting tower scheme there to the bastions in the fortress town of Loreto in the Marche (Fig. 5). The latter has two bastions similar in dimensions and proportion to the bastion of Gallipoli. The approach employed is one of the numerous transitional/experimental forms leading 37.

The first papal governor of Loreto, Do- menico Sebastopoli, wrote a letter, dated 18 June 1508, stating that a certain "Francesco da Sena" had made designs and a model for three "Puntuni" (projecting towers or defenses) for the city walls and a plan for a water supply system on which papal authorities had spent 2000 ducats. Bramante, Francesco di Gior- gio's colleague, oversaw the implementation of these designs (c. 1507-1511).39 The design of the projecting tower in the castle of Gallipoli, nearly identical with those of Loreto of known authorship, strongly suggests an attribution to Francesco di Giorgio.40 39. .

There is a broad circular tower of similar proportions in the outer defensive ring of the castle complex of Bracciano. In November 1490, G. Virginius Orsini of Brac- ciano, Captain General of the Aragonese Crown, invited Francesco di Giorgio to design a fortress at Campagnano (a small city in Etruria) and "alchune altre cose a mi necessarie in questi lochi." (See the cor- respondence published by Milanesi, Documenti, II, 440-442.) The main castle of Bracciano was started in the 1470s and finished about 1485. It is distinctly late medieval in its general proportions and form, and its defenses are based on technology that predates the use of artillery. Molajoli indicates that Francesco di Giorgio certainly worked on the design and detailing of the courtyard and staircase, as well as the design of interior doorways at the Castle of Bracciano. His argument is made on stylistic grounds and the knowledge of Francesco di Giorgio's visit of 1490. See B. Molajoli, "Bracciano," Enciclopedia italiana, VIII, 1930, 645-647. The nearly identical designs of the broad circular towers at Bracciano and Gallipoli would also strongly suggest a Martinian inter- Taranto is the site of another major Aragonese fortification project (Fig. 6).

Alessandro Del Bufalo, the architect who carried out the mod- ern preservation and restoration of the castle of Avezzano, a major defensive structure of the Orsini, attributes its design to Francesco di Giorgio. He points to the plaque on the portal, which indicates the date at which the construction commenced, 1490, and the owner, G. Vir- ginius Orsini. The castle is nearly square in plan with four circular corner towers. Ground level artillery casemates are found at the inside corners of the towers. Del Bufalo points to characteristics in tower detailing that are not unlike Francesco di Giorgio's (Del Bufalo, II Castello Orsini in Avezzano: storia e restauro, Rome, 1987). The attribution is interesting, but Avezzano is closer to Luciano Laurana's castle at Pesaro, Baccio Pontelli's castle at Senigallia, or the castle at Imola, all of which share a simple square plan with round towers and no use of the prismatic forms and polygonal plans favored by Francesco di Gior- gio.

The new channel served as a moat and as an additional link between the "Mar Grande" (the Gulf of Taranto) and the "Mar Piccolo," a lagoon used as the city's harbor. In 1484, Ferdinand of Aragon sent Marino Brancaccio to Taranto with instructions to collab- orate with the chatelain Matteo Crispano to determine the work required on the new fortress controlling this channel. Crispano was superseded, in about 1492, by Andrea Assante di Pozzuoli and Marcantonio Filomarino, who carried on the construction.4' 41.

Speziale saw many similarities between the Aragonese fortress of Taranto and the castles located in the Marche and Romagna- especially that at Sasso di Monte Feltro, which displays a V-shaped ravelin, flanked by two circular towers.42 He noted the rela- tionship between transitional artillery fortifications at Taranto and elsewhere, such as Otranto and Gallipoli in the Puglie, and developments in the Marche, Romagna, and Umbria that can 42. Sasso di Montefeltro is a castle in the Duchy of Urbino, which Francesco di Giorgio designed and built for Federico da Montefeltro, and which he describes and illustrates in the Trattati (Magliabechiano II.I.141, fol. 69r, and Maltese, Trattati, 461-462.) The actual structure was badly eroded by the beginning of this century, further damaged by bombardment in World War II, and, ultimately, largely bulldozed in the 1960s and 1970s.</page><page sequence="9">DECHERT: THE MILITARY ARCHITECTURE OF FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO 169 Fig. 10. Francesco di Giorgio, towers and angled bastion, Magliabe- chiano II.I.141, fol. 239v (tracing by author). be ascribed to the presence of the architects Francesco di Giorgio and Ciro Ciri, who both served in the court of Urbino. The date of construction, indicated on two Aragonese plaques in the castle of Taranto, is 1492, coinciding with Francesco di Gior- gio's presence in the Puglie. Speziale states that both the length of walls and their configuration and placement of artillery case- mates correspond to Francesco di Giorgio's idealized fortress designs in the Trattati.43 The fortress of Taranto is an irregular quadrilateral in plan, with a great bastion projecting toward the sea and, on the land side, a tail-like appendage that ended in a tower (Figs. 7, 8, and 9). That tower has disappeared to make way for the modern bridge and its supports. The circular towers are composed of three internal floors and a parapet level. The two lowest floors have small, circular, vaulted rooms, which are vertically con- nected to each other and to the parapet by shafts that open through their respective vaults. The shafts bypass the third floor, which is composed of several casemates joined by corridors. The vaulted rooms appear to have been powder and shot magazines that supplied only the parapet guns. This was done in order to keep the amount of powder at any given level to a minimum so that the batteries would not be put out of commission by an accidental explosion. The shaft system at Taranto is not unlike the dumbwaiter shaft in Francesco di Giorgio's castle at Mon- davio.44 The bastion is the most convincing expression of Francesco di Giorgio's role in the design of the fortress of Taranto (Fig. 8). To date no one has noted the remarkable parallel between 43. Speziale, Storia militare di Taranto, 43-44. 44. Magliabechiano II.I.141, fol. 70v; Maltese (ed.), Trattati, 463- 464. The use of supply and ventilation shafts is innovative and a func- tional necessity in artillery fortifications for the reasons stated. In me- dieval towns and castles, trap doors and holes were frequently left in floors and ceilings, directly connecting rooms stacked one above the other, for precisely these purposes. Fig. 11.

The purpose of this configuration is clear: the round towers provide flanking fire down the sides of the bastion. The bastion in turn provides protective artillery fire for the adjacent walls and towers. Similar details may be found in Francesco di Gior- gio's castle at Cagli (Fig. 11) and, in modified form, at those of San Leo and Sassocorvaro, built for Federico da Montefeltro.45 The only other architect who used, or rather illustrated, this form was Leonardo da Vinci in his Codex Atlanticus, fol. 117r (of the 1490s). This is not surprising, as Leonardo da Vinci and Francesco di Giorgio collaborated on structural issues for the Tiburio in Milan and Cathedral of Pavia in 1490, and Leonardo used many Martinian forms in his Piombino fortifications of 1502, illustrated in the Madrid Codex II.46 One element in the plan at Taranto is especially interesting-the tail ending in a tower, shown in Speziale's drawing, but now covered over by the road approaching the modern bridge.

Worthy of note is the chapel inside the castle of Taranto. This caught the attention of R. Pane, who believes it reflects Francesco di Giorgio's designs for San Bernardino in Urbino and Santa Maria del Calcinaio in Cortona. The chapel exhibits the taut and limpid High Renaissance detailing commonly found in central and northern Italy. The structure is composed of a cupola over the altar area and an arcuated vault over the room for the congregation.

Almond-shaped bastion at Monte Sant'Angelo (author). site inspections, and aerial surveys, one can expand considerably the probable sites of Francesco di Giorgio's design intervention. Manfredonia is a port city at the southwest corner of the Gargano peninsula. It was established as a new town in the 13th century. An Angevin castle built at that time was enlarged and restructured to become an artillery fortress in the late 15th and early 16th century.49 The result is an Angevin castle embedded in a 15th-century enceinte, positioned at the northeast corner of the town, where it could defend the port area, the beach, and the town itself (Figs. 13 and 14). Three of the circular towers on the outer wall and the wall itself have features similar to those fortifications described for Gallipoli, Otranto, and Ta- ranto as well as to those built by Francesco di Giorgio in the Marche and depicted in his Trattati. The towers have a strongly battered base, topped by a cordon of stone, and a cylindrical upper section ending in a real or decorative machicolation, upon which the parapet normally rests. Owing to later alterations, this parapet no longer exists at Manfredonia. At the inside cor- ners and faces of the towers are casemates protecting the walls and approaches. Much of the space between the medieval castle walls and new enceinte was backfilled with earth in order to provide greater resistance to artillery. The first period of modernization at Manfredonia lasted from 1487 to 1491. Although it has never been noted before, it is evident that Francesco di Giorgio was present at the construction of Manfredonia's fortress for at least part of this period. An accountant's report of expenditures and payments for the year 1489, under the heading "The Account for the Construction and Moat of Manfredonia," in a document called the Fonti Aragonesi, states: "On the 26th day of May, Master Jorgi Senese and Master Angelo de Rosano and associates were paid 45 ducats 49. G. Abatino, "II castello di Manfredonia," Napoli nobilissima, XI, 1902, 44-45; G.

Savelli, La rocca di Fossombrone, 1978, by author). for the excavation of a moat."50 Master Jorgi Senese must cer- tainly be Francesco di Giorgio, for there is no other known Sienese military architect or builder who worked on Aragonese defenses in the Puglie in this period. Existing documentation regarding the architect indicates he was active in and around Siena and Gubbio (part of the Duchy of Urbino) in January and July of 1489.51 Francesco di Giorgio was able to reach the Puglie by a direct and speedy route. From the Duchy of Urbino he could have taken a ship from one of the "Pentapolis" ports, 50.

His activity in Manfredonia in May, therefore, would fit reasonably between the two periods of work farther north. Monte Sant'Angelo is about ten kilometers from Manfredo- nia, and is sited on the first ridge of the Gargano Peninsula overlooking the port. At the highest point of this town is another Aragonese fortification. Speziale, Pane, DeVita, and Volpe have all identified this structure as certainly the work of Francesco di Giorgio, because of the geometry of the plan and especially the almond-shaped bastion (Figs. 15 and 16). On two towers of the castle are engraved the dates 1491 and 1493. Authors generally point to this as proof of Francesco di Giorgio's in- volvement, due to his role in the Puglie in and around that period.52 The bastion at Monte Sant'Angelo is of a type found in only a handful of defensive structures in the period between the 1470s and 1507.53 Its design is characteristic of Francesco 52.

Volpe excavated and studied the bastion of Fossombrone, which was restructured in the 1470s under Federico da Montefeltro. Leonardo da Vinci inspected this structure in 1483 for Ludovico il Moro. Leonardo recorded his visit with comments in the Codex Ambrosiano (see Volpe and Savelli, La rocca di Fossombrone, 92). DeVita (Torri ed opere fortificate, 62) reports that the Rocchetta Sant'Antonio in the Appennines above Foggia was built in 1507 by di Giorgio or his disciples in either the Duchy of Urbino or the Puglie. Francesco di Giorgio employed this form in the castles of Sassocorvaro and Fossombrone (Fig. 17), and he illustrated it widely in the Trattati and other drawings. The castle of Monte Sant'Angelo is built around the remains of an existing rectangular tower of Norman, and probably Byz- antine, origin. The plan is a long irregular polygon with two circular towers, at two corners of the Norman tower, connected to the bastion projecting beyond the enceinte. The link tying the bastion to the enceinte and main structure is the gate. Be- tween the bastion-controlled gate area and the Norman tower is a broad courtyard controlled by a now ruinous quartercircular defensive wall and platform adjoining the main tower complex. The Aragonese construction, including the tunnels and case- mates within the circular towers, is largely in good shape.54 In addition to the stylistic elements that strongly suggest attribution to Francesco di Giorgio or his associates, there is circumstantial evidence for the probable role of Francesco di Giorgio at Manfredonia. Many of the masters and workers re- sponsible for the construction ofManfredonia's castle came from Monte Sant'Angelo, including a "mastro fabricatore" named Ladislao II d'Aquino. This small triangular castle has a perfect almond- shaped tower at one corer. By 1507 this design was, at best, obsolescent, but it indicates the longevity of Francesco di Giorgio's design vocabulary even when better (i.e., more cost-effective) configurations were avail- able. Other structures of uncertain authorship employing this feature are at Carovigno (1490s) and the extraordinary castle at Vasto (ca. 1499). 54.

Certainly the most important indication of Francesco di Gior- gio's presence in the design is the nearly identical disposition of towers, walls, and bastions in the Castle of Monte Sant'Angelo and in the castle of Reggio Calabria (Fig. 18). Such a comparison has been difficult because the city and castle of Reggio Calabria were almost completely destroyed by the earthquake of 1908. At present, only two tall, circular, damaged towers remain. Their stylistic similarities to Martinian towers in the Marche is clear. The castle is certainly an Aragonese construction, as re- vealed in a published letter of King Ferdinand written in 1480.56 The document expresses the intent to rebuild and further fortify Reggio Calabria as a necesary preparation for an expected Turk- ish invasion-in fact, the very invasion that caused the fall of Otranto in 1480. In view of the continuing threat, construction at Reggio was carried into the 1490s.57 Reggio Calabria was important politically and militarily because it served as the res- idence of the Duke of Calabria and the administrative center of the Duchy of Calabria.58 A drawing made in 1847 depicts the castle with a large rect- angular plan, four corner towers (including the two very large towers still extant), a broad internal court with a quarter-circular internal defensive wall very similar to that at Monte Sant'Angelo, 55.

The bastion is composed of an irregular square, from which extends an almond-shaped bastion, the tip of which is shown in ruins in the drawings.59 Comparing the plan of Monte Sant'Angelo to the bottom half of the Reggio Calabria plan, one is immediately struck by the use of identical design elements in nearly the same sequence: the two towers, the internal quarter-circular walls, and the al- mond-shaped bastion. Information in the 1847 drawing of the castle is supported by Pacichelli's 1703 view of the city and castle of Reggio Calabria, which shows the trace of the pro- jecting almond-shaped bastion at the end of a quadrilateral bas- tion (Fig. 18)60.

A letter of early No- vember 1494 states that Baccio Pontelli is head of the "work of the castello de regio" and that Antonio Marchesi is to sub- stitute for him.62 Both of these architects were disciples and colleagues of Francesco di Giorgio.63 tefeltro's son-in-law, Papal Prefect of Rome and Lord of Senigallia and Mondavio. These two structures were being built in the 1490s. Giovanni commissioned Baccio Pontelli to design the castle of Senigallia, which was probably started in 1480. Between 1487 and 1494, Pontelli was papal military architect for the Marche, in charge of the fortification of Osimo, Iesi and Offida. Baccio Pontelli and Francesco di Giorgio knew each other from Pontelli's presence in the court of Urbino in 1481. Authors such as G. DeFiore and E. Rocchi point to the strong design influence of Francesco di Giorgio on Baccio Pontelli's military archi- tecture. See G. DeFiore, Baccio Pontelli, Rome, 1963; and E. Rocchi, "Baccio Pontelli e la rocca d'Ostia," Arte, I, 1898, 27-31. 62. N. Barone, "Notizie storiche," XIV, 201-202. 63. Antonio Marchesi was the son of Giorgio Marchesi, the chief architect of Girolamo Riario, the Papal Lord of Imola, and occasional ally of Federico da Montefeltro. Antonio and Giorgio Marchesi were military architects in charge of the castle of Imola as well as the architects who completed Luciano Laurana's design for the Rocca Costanza in Pesaro. Laurana was architect of the ducal palace of Urbino, a role subsequently assumed by Francesco di Giorgio. See F. Mancini, Urban- istica rinascimentale a Imola da Girolamo Riario a Leonardo da Vinci (1474- 1502) (2 vols.), Imola, 1979. These volumes include a large number of documentary sources regarding the building activity of the Marchesi family and the rulers of Imola. It is interesting to note that Girolamo Riario's nephew, Cardinal Raffaele Riario, the builder of the Cancelleria in Rome, was the person who handled payments and administrative matters regarding the previously mentioned fortifications of Iesi, Osimo, Fig. 22. Castle of Ortona, west elevation. Almond-shaped tower on left; entrance and helicoidal ramps in tower on right (author). Baccio Pontelli's famous castle at Ostia (1483) (Fig. 20) in- corporates a design vocabulary similar to that used at Reggio Calabria and Monte Sant'Angelo, especially in the relation of the two principal circular towers and the bastion. On the basis of style, it is often difficult to separate work for which Francesco di Giorgio is immediately responsible from the work of his disciples. One may suggest that Francesco di Giorgio, who held a preeminent position as military architect in southern Italy, and had broad design authority, may well have needed the help and Offida, by Baccio Pontelli (see DeFiore, Baccio Pontelli, 114-115, for published archival documents). Antonio Marchesi's relations to Fran- cesco di Giorgio and the Aragonese crown are reasonably well docu- mented; see R. Filangieri, "Antonio Marchesi da Settignano architetto militare del Rinascimento," 473ff.; see also L. A. Maggiorotti, "Antonio Marchesi," Breve dizionario degli architetti e ingegneri militari italiani, Rome, 1935. Clearly the relations between Francesco di Giorgio, Baccio Pon- telli, and Antonio Marchesi are founded on the relations of their patrons and their patrons' families, as well as their professional collaboration and participation in court life, especially in the courts of Rome and Urbino.</page><page sequence="15">DECHERT: THE MILITARY ARCHITECTURE OF FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO 175 w ^WPi F r: ** --r- - : ; * &gt; 7 - f ,N \ \ v * i I 1 :;, S Fig. 23.

Giv- en the unity of style and approach, one can speak of Francesco di Giorgio and his "school" of military architecture in southern Italy. On the coast of the Abruzzi, north of Manfredonia, is a city called Ortona or Ortonamare, one of the northernmost Adriatic port cities of the Kingdom of Naples. The town is sited on a high ridge overlooking a natural harbor with a sand beach. The old town is relatively long and narrow, with a castle on a bluff at the seaward end overlooking the main street (Figs. 21 and 22). A strong argument can be made that the castle of Ortona is the work of Francesco di Giorgio. The walls and towers share the battered base, stone cordon, and vertical upper wall com- monly used by the architect. The parapet and machicolations have been cut down or have collapsed. On the landward side (the west) of the castle is an almond-shaped tower not unlike those of Fossombrone and Monte Sant'Angelo but proportion- ately higher. The remaining two towers are circular. One of the round towers incorporates a helicoidal ramp, a feature Fran- cesco di Giorgio employed at Sassocorvaro and the great tower overlooking the Porta di via Valbona in Urbino.64 The helicoidal 64.

British Museum Ms. 197.b.21, fol. 21v. ramp in Ortona is an interesting variant: it is composed of two ramps, and each makes a two-fifths turn around the central masonry drum. They twist upward in opposite directions, per- mitting individuals to enter and exit the tower (and castle) by separate routes. The second round tower is identical to the one mentioned above, except that it is backfilled with earth to make it more resistant to artillery fire. In fact, the entire castle is built around an earthen platform 4 to 5 m. above the entry level. The wall joining the almond-shaped tower and the entry tower makes an approximately quarter-circular trace. Due to bom- bardments during World War II and substantial landslides, the northern half of the castle has largely disappeared. Pacichelli's 1703 print of the city and castle of Ortona, though a little distorted, indicates that the castle had the three towers presently visible and two other corner towers on the north side as well as the walls joining them.65 An aerial photograph of Ortona reveals the plan of the castle (Fig. 23).66 One can detect a double wall on the east side joining an almost completely collapsed tower at the northeast corner to the complete circular tower at 65.

The tower at the southeast is joined by a largely intact wall on its south side (facing the town) to the tower with the double helicoidal ramps and entry. In turn the entry tower is joined to the almond-shaped tower by a wall that forms a quarter circle in plan. If one draws a line lengthwise through the castle, that is, through the almond-shaped tower at the west to the middle of the eastern walls, and then reflects the plan symmetrically around this axis, one discovers a surprisingly accurate built version of an early manuscript drawing of Francesco di Giorgio found in the British Library, the Ms. 197.b.21, fol. 21v. (formerly Harley 3281) (Fig. 24). The only element in the drawing that is missing from Ortona is a great semicircular bastion. The British Museum manuscript of Francesco di Giorgio is a work dedicated to Fede- rico da Montefeltro and probably presented around 1474. Betts suggests that it was presented to Federico da Montefeltro with the purpose of offering his services as a military architect and engineer.67 The manuscript depicts eight fortresses including the Ortona-type plan. In character, these drawings resemble, if they do not duplicate, those in the Vatican Taccuino of Francesco di Giorgio, the so- called "Codicetto."68 Scaglia writes of these "Codicetto forts" by 67.

There is nothing like them in Taccola's manuscripts, or elsewhere....69 Scaglia's remark appears premature in light of the existence of the Ortona castle.70 Unquestionably, the castle is early and is recognized by several authors as an important design bridging the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.71 A document published in Fonti Aragonesi con- firms that the castle was constructed between March and Oc- tober of 1468.72 The existence of Ortona raises two possibilities: either Francesco di Giorgio actually designed the castle of Or- 69. Scaglia, "Francesco di Giorgio's chapters on fortresses and on war machines," 47. 70. The author has discovered a small castle at Montefiori di Recanati near Recanati and Loreto, similar to some of Francesco di Giorgio's early fort drawings. Montefiori's castle is a somewhat irregular polyg- onal trace, closely approximating a circle about 40 meters in diameter, with a central square tower and a perfectly formed triangular bastion/ ravelin in front of the main gate. The walls are heavily angled, and gun positions are placed rather low in the walls. The inscription at the front door states: OPT. DVVMVRIS ANTONIO.POLITI.GABRIELIS CPQ R STATUIT MCCCCLXVII. The architect is unknown. The Gabrieli family was a rival of Federico da Montefeltro at the city of Gubbio. This suggests a presently unknown military architect who may well have influenced Francesco di Giorgio. 71. I. C. Gavini, Storia dell'architettura in Abruzzo (2 vols.), Rome and Milan, n.d.

The former seems distinctly more likely, for the plan design is without precedent elsewhere. The Duke of Calabria was an active ally of Federico da Montefeltro, and his presence in Urbino is recorded in August of 1465 and again in 1469,73 leading one to suspect that Francesco di Giorgio may have been introduced to Federico by the Duke of Calabria. The city of Matera is the site of another Aragonese fortifi- cation (Fig. 25). The Castello Tramontano was built on the bluffs overlooking the city, at the end of the 15th century. The city had been given to Giovan Carlo Tramontano as a feudal holding by King Ferdinand II.74 A chronicler reported that Tra- montano wanted his castle to match the grandeur of the Castel Nuovo in Naples. Although left unfinished, the construction of the three existing towers and walls cost 25,000 ducats.75 73. Volpe and Savelli, La rocca di Fossombrone, 90-91. 74. P.

Fig. 27. Tower and gate of Castello Tramontano, Matera (author). The composition is symmetrical with a tall central keep linked via thick walls to the flanking round towers, which are smaller versions of the central tower. Extending out from the small towers are two incomplete wall segments 5 m. long and sharply angled to one another-indicating convergence had the scheme been completed. To this day, piles of large, cut stones and classically inspired cornice details lie in line with the angled walls. The present distance between the ends of the inner faces of these truncated walls is 39 m. The inner sides of the 5 m. walls indicate convergence at a mound approximately 42 m. from where they presently end. Thus, the original court was planned to approximate an equilateral triangle (Fig. 26).76 On the side opposite the probable court is a moat 4 m. wide, in good condition, and the main gate, whose elevation is re- markably like that of the principal gate of Taranto facing the 76. Speziale translated Francesco di Giorgio's dimensions into metric lengths and related them to the maximum distance at which a crossbow could be effective, that is, 46 m. Speziale noted that the castle of Taranto had wall lengths of 46 m., 45 m., 39 m., 32 m. (Speziale, Storia militare di Taranto, 43). Matera's two principal dimensions are 39 m. and 42 m., very much in line with the Taranto dimensions.</page><page sequence="18">178 JSAH, XLIX:2, JUNE 1990 I? I I/ 1 I 1 ' X =,? ` t, ,t- Fig. 28. Castello Tramontano, Matera, unfinished courtyard (author). canal (Figs. 27 and 28; cf. Fig. 9). The gate structure at Matera penetrates the wall and opens into the courtyard area. From the configuration of the earth in front of the gate, one can detect a roughly triangular platform with broad smooth faces indicat- ing the presence of a ravelin and glacis. The structure itself has the finest qualities of pre-bastion design: casemates at the bases of the towers, small rectangular artillery loops in the parapets, beautifully executed machicolations, cordons, and battered bas- es. All these elements are characteristic of Martinian works. The castle of Matera is analogous to the castle of Taranto in design. The relation of a large central tower flanked by smaller towers, with a court defined by symmetrically disposed walls that converge, is not unlike a plan sketched in the Vatican "Codicetto" Urbinate latino 1757 on fol. 58r or fol. 73r of the British Library Ms. 197.b.21(Fig. 29). The manuscripts show diamond-shaped compounds, whereas Matera actually is trian- gular, really a half of the manuscript images. However, if one takes into consideration the probable triangular ravelin in front of the main gate, a diamond shape would have characterized the completed compound at Matera.77 Francesco di Giorgio's personal involvement in Matera is not known, but the style and approach certainly indicate that he, or one of his "school," with access to his personal notes or less circulated manuscripts, de- signed the Castello Tramontano. Brindisi, a city of ancient foundation, has long been one of the most important ports in Italy because of its size, extensive harbor facilities, and protected waters. The town has extensive remains of its late 15th-century Aragonese defenses. Like nearby Otranto, Brindisi was exposed to Turkish incursions in the 15th century. The castle of Brindisi, which has a core structure erect- ed in 1227 by Frederick II, with Angevin additions from 1273 and 1274, was upgraded by the Aragonese King Ferdinand, who also rebuilt the city walls.78 77.

Pane has identified the castle of Brindisi as having elements characteristic of Francesco di Giorgio and believes that the ar- chitect undertook its modernization in 1492.79 Visual inspection of the outermost ring of walls at the castle and a short segment of city wall adjacent to the castle reveals characteristics not unlike the towers and walls at Otranto or the castle of Taranto. Unlike other sites, the castle of Brindisi is an active military installation and therefore is not open for close inspection of either the exterior or the interior. Andrea della Monaca, who wrote a history of Brindisi in 1674, highlights several important features of the Aragonese fortification (Figs. 30 and 31). Be- tween the old castle walls and the new ring of walls was the old moat. King Ferdinand had this intervening moat vaulted over and covered with earth in order to provide an underground living space capable of housing the entire population of Brindisi in time of war. Natural well springs found in the excavation of the new moat provided water for both the defenders and the protected civilian population. The description of extensive un- derground shelters designed to accommodate the populace in time of war or siege is extraordinary. The concept clearly arose 79.

Plan of Castle of Brindisi (from DeVita, Torri ed operefortificate, tracing by author). from a knowledge of the devastating impact of high-angle ar- tillery fire on cities under siege. The disastrous experience of the fall of Otranto probably encouraged this radical solution, the first reported civil defense bunker ever designed. Finally, the castle was provided with pre-positioned hollow places for explosive charges to be placed to deny the structure to its ene- mies if it could no longer be held.80 The difficulty encountered in retaking Otranto almost certainly suggested this prototypical use of chambering. Underground tunnels for communications and secret passages were not unusual in castles; large man-made underground assembly spaces were also introduced at this time. A few castles in Italy have extant tunnels and passages, and one such castle, at Fossombrone, is reported to have had extensive vaulted un- derground spaces.81 The vaults and tunnels under the courtyard of Fossombrone's castle are apparently of the 15th century and were probably built under Federico da Montefeltro. One reason for such spaces was to allow large groups of soldiers and other defenders to gather without giving away their numbers, should they be spied on from the overlooking mountains. Similarly, Brindisi castle may be seen as a parallel application of under- ground works. Francesco di Giorgio extensively illustrates tun- 80. Andrea della Monaca, Memoria storica dell'antichissima cittd di Brin- disi, Lecce, 1674, 564-565. 81. Volpe, La Rocca di Fossombrone, has published the description written by Modesto Morosini in a 19th-century manuscript at Biblioteca Passionei in Fossombrone, as well as eyewitness accounts of under- ground passages, 130ff. neling for both communications and mining operations during sieges and the use of counter mines in resisting a siege.82 Brindisi is a subtle and largely unseen application of Martinian principles. In continuous and imminent threat from the Turks, Brindisi, perhaps more than any other defended town or com- plex, reflects Francesco di Giorgio's concept: "The fortress must be the principal component of the city, because it is like the head of the body. When it is lost, so is the body, likewise when the fortress is lost, so is the city it rules. Therefore it must be carefully watched, and must be properly ordered and composed so that only through great effort, subterfuge, or ingeniousness will it be lost."83 Francesco di Giorgio developed his theory of urban design and defense upon this anthropomorphic analogy. The city and fortress, in time of war or siege, became symbolically and prac- tically one. The fortress was both the symbol and the instrument of a community willing to exert itself to preserve its cultural identity and civic order. Conclusion The results of this investigation have made it possible to increase levels of certainty regarding a substantial number of Martinian interventions in southern Italy and to identify new ones.

By comparing drawings illustrated in his manuscripts and his built works in Central Italy to those in southern Italy, one can discern the actual breadth of his effort. A "school" of fortification maintained the Martinian tradition in the persons ofBaccio Pontelli and especially Antonio Marchesi, who carried on as senior military architect in southern Italy and Naples (at the Castel Nuovo) after Francesco di Gior- gio's return to Siena.84 Common design elements and plans and philosophy characterize the practice of these three prominent military architects in the period of transition to the mature artillery fortress. 84.

Francesco di Giorgio's work in the kingdom of southern Italy marks an important period in his career development and in the evolution of military architecture caused by the technological challenge of gunpowder and artillery. Fortifications were the principal deterrent to war, and therefore immense sums were appropriated for their construction. The threats of Turkish in- vasion on the Adriatic and Ionian coasts and the dynastic rivalries over control of the crown of Naples combined to stimulate research, development, and the execution of powerful defensive works. Francesco di Giorgio had great responsibility for the design and construction of defensive works in the Duchy of Urbino under Federico da Montefeltro; it was in southern Italy, with the power and resources of a modern and wealthy state, that he and his "school of fortification" matured. The efforts of this school provide a critical link in the transition from Me- dieval to Renaissance design.</page></plain_text>
