COMMENTARIES Living in the Future in the Past: On the Origins and Expression of Self-Regulatory Abilities Daniel Cervone and Nilly Rafaeli-Mor Department of Psychology University of Illinois at Chicago Ability is a tricky term in psychological analyses. It can refer to distinctly different things. Ability can refer to a distinct functional capacity that derives from a par- ticular mental system. People have the ability to per- ceive objects in three-dimensional space thanks to their visual information-processing system (Marr, 1982). It can refer to more molar and generalized ca- pacities that rely on a collection of mental systems. People have the ability to acquire skills through obser- vation, or modeling, thanks to a combination of attentional, memory, and production systems (Bandura, 1986, 1999). Alternatively, ability can be used in a descriptive way that makes little or no refer- ence to specific mental systems. People have the abil- ity to build great cities, to pollute the environment, and to send a man to the moon. Here, "have the ability" means little more than "they did it." Martin's (this issue) analysis of delayed-return abilities raises the question of what kind of ability he has in mind. At times ability appears to be used de- scriptively. People managed "to thrive [within] an ag- ricultural and pastoral lifestyle." From this, Martin concludes that they "have the ability" to thrive in such settings: They did it. Martin obviously is not proposing a cognitive system that is dedicated to "thriving." The ability to thrive does not reside solely in people's heads, but is a product of both individual- and group-level processes. In other passages, however, the delayed-return abilities appear to be specifiable mental processes. They include "rumination, problem solving, mental simulation," and so on. Delayed-return abilities, then, appear to be cognitive capacities that enable people to reflect on their past, strategize for their fu- ture, and thus regulate their behavior in the absence of external feedback. Indeed, this reading of Mar- tin's arguments may seem obvious. We spell it out because it leads to a question, the answer to which is less obvious: Where did these delayed-return abili- ties come from? Martin's (this issue) discussion of our ancestral past naturally suggests an evolutionary analysis. Mental mechanisms can be seen to have evolved through their success in solving recurrent adaptive problems (Barkow, Cosmides, &amp; Tooby, 1992). In an evolution- ary approach, one can reverse-engineer the mind (Pinker, 1997) by (a) observing a contemporary feature of mind/brain and (b) scouring the ancestral environ- ment to determine what that feature of mind/brain was designed to do-that is, what recurrent evolutionary problem it was designed to solve. Consider what happens if we attempt to re- verse-engineer the delayed-return abilities, as de- scribed by Martin (this issue). First, what contempo- rary feature of mind do we observe? People have the ability to "transform delayed-return situations into immediate-return ones." These delayed-return abili- ties provide feedback, enjoyment, and a sense of opti- mism that enable people to cope with "uncertain, de- layed outcomes." Second, what was the nature of the ancestral environment? People "evolved in ... imme- diate-return system[s]" in which they "live in the phenomenal present and ... receive almost immediate feedback regarding the efficacy of their efforts." Un- fortunately, our reverse engineering has failed. The features of mind we have observed, the de- layed-return abilities, solve an adaptive problem that purportedly was not present in the ancestral environ- ment. Mental mechanisms that compensate for a lack of immediate task feedback seem to have evolved within an environment that rarely, if ever, presented this problem in the first place. In his discussion of self-esteem motives, Martin recognizes that an "ex- clusion detector" would have been "superfluous" in an immediate-return environment. This charge could be leveled against the whole gamut of delayed-return abilities. There are at least two ways out of this puzzle. One is to recognize that the delayed-return abilities may not be adaptations to specific problems of evolution. In-</page><page sequence="2">COMMENTARIES stead, they may be by-products of other, perhaps more general, cognitive capacities. Once an organism has re- flective self-consciousness, it may be that all the spe- cific delayed-return capacities inevitably follow. This translates the problem "How did the delayed-return abilities evolve?" into "How did consciousness evolve?" A variation of this approach would be to ad- dress the problem in terms of "hardware" and "soft- ware" (e.g., Dennett, 1992). Evolution in immediate-return systems would have yielded hard- ware that enables people to ruminate on the past and the future, but only in delayed-return societies would we find the software (linguistic communication, cul- tural meaning systems, etc.) required for the full range of delayed-return strategies employed by contempo- rary persons (see Durham, 1991, and Geertz, 1973, for analyses of interactions between cultural information and biological hardware). This solution surely is at least partly correct. Time Travel in Ancestral Minds A second possibility is that our reverse engineering has failed because Martin has not accurately character- ized the ancestral environment and our ancestor's minds. Martin (this issue) claims that "our species" spent "the first 90% (or more) of its existence" in im- mediate-return systems. Anatomically modern hu- mans appeared roughly 100,000 years ago (Mithen, 1996), so this means that people lived exclusively in immediate-return systems until the Holocene, about 10,000 years ago, when earth's climate warmed and people of various regions first adopted agriculture. Be- fore the Holocene, people purportedly were "nonstoring hunters and gatherers." They lived in the "phenomenal present." They left their sick to die and buried the dead casually in shallow graves. "Beliefs in an afterlife [were] nonexistent." Such concerns are not "an inherent feature of human nature but a by-product of life in a delayed-return culture." Indeed, "there is no evidence" that our pre-Holocene ancestors "place[d] any great value on the idea of permanence, either in this life or afterward." We are not archeologists. However, we suspect that some members of this profession would be surprised by these claims. In contrast to the depiction of nonstoring hunter-gatherers, archeological evidence from central Russia indicates that "hunter-gatherers ... used storage throughout the Upper Paleolithic" (Soffer, 1985, p. 253), with storage pits found at sites as much as 25,000 years old. In contrast to the claim that people lived solely in the phenomenal pres- ent-and hunted in "discontinuous undertakings of relatively short duration (e.g., hours)" (Martin, this is- sue)- hunter-gatherers of this period appear to have tracked "seasonal and long-term fluctuations in animal numbers and behavioural patterns" (Mithen, 1996, p. 168).1 Although Martin finds no evidence that pre-Holocene peoples valued an afterlife, others con- clude that evidence from cave art and burial sites is so strong that "we can be confident that religious ideolo- gies as complex as those of modern hunter-gatherers came into existence at the time of the Middle/Upper Paleolithic transition" (Mithen, 1996, p. 177). Al- though many dead undoubtedly were buried in shallow graves, many others were not; for example, Mithen de- scribed a burial site of 28,000 years ago in which two deceased adolescents were each adorned with approxi- mately 5,000 ivory beads. The claim that beliefs about religion and self-perpetuation are a relatively recent cultural construction must contend with Boyer's (1994) detailed analysis of how ancestral and contem- porary religious beliefs can be understood as natural outgrowths of human's evolved, domain-specific intu- itive knowledge of the world. The archeological evidence suggests two conclu- sions. First, Martin may have underestimated the simi- larity between the cognitive abilities of contemporary humans and our Upper Paleolithic ancestors. As Pinker (1997) noted, the people of 45,000 years ago con- structed shelters. They built boats and sailed across open waters. They drew pictures, constructed sym- bolic artifacts, and wore decorative clothing. "They were us" (Pinker, 1997, p. 202). If one wished to recon- cile Martin's theory with the evidence that members of some Upper Paleolithic societies engaged in activities requiring considerable forethought and planning, one might claim that some of these hunter-gatherer societ- ies actually could be categorized as delayed-return sys- tems rather than immediate-return societies. But this leads to our second conclusion.2 "Delayed-return" and "immediate-return" societies may not be as categori- cally distinct as Martin's (this issue) analysis implies. Instead, they may be "just two poles on a continuum" (Mithen, 1996, p. 226), as suggested by work on the highly related distinction between hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists (Higgs &amp; Jarman, 1969, 1972). The hunter-gatherer societies of the Upper Paleolithic exhibited geographical sedentism and patterns of food storage that "are precursors of Holocene food produc- tion" (Soffer, 1989, p. 719). Some of these ancient so- cieties, then, clearly were not locked into the "phenomenal present" but instead gave at least some Mithen (1996) noted that the !Kung, a group explicitly cited by Woodburn (1982) as living in an immediate-return economic sys- tem, predict the future behavior of animals via anthropomorphic reasoning. Modifying the theory by claiming that the Upper Paleolithic soci- eties in which people stored food and practiced religion were de- layed-return systems raises an additional problem. If one can simply reclassify societies that violate the theory's expectations, then the theory is no longer testable-specifically, it is no longer open to a negative test. 210</page><page sequence="3">COMMENTARIES thought to their short-term and long-term futures. Peo- ple possessed "delayed-return abilities" long before they adopted agriculture. Some evidence suggests that even Homo-erectus (living around 1.6 million years ago) had the ability to envision and plan for the future. For example, Homo-erectus crafted the Acheulian bifacial hand ax, which is sharp on both sides (Suddendorf &amp; Corballis, 1997). Constructing this ax requires a much greater in- vestment of time than does a single-sided tool, but the resulting ax is a more useful tool in the long run. The ax's builders presumably had the ability to envision the potential long-term benefits of its construction. Fur- ther, anecdotal evidence suggests that even some apes are capable of future planning (De Waal, 1982), al- though their capabilities clearly are inferior to those of early humans. It seems implausible that the ability to focus beyond the present that was at least a small part of the repertoire of our ancestors of 1.6 million years ago (and that may be present to a lesser degree in cer- tain primates) would have ceased to exist in later im- mediate-return societies. The Possession and Expression of Abilities We have seen, then, that our ancestors of 45,000 years ago were cognitively capable of orienting them- selves to the future and working toward long-term ob- jectives. However, it does seem quite likely that they spent less time worrying about and working toward distal futures than do we. There are at least two reasons for this. They involve enabling factors and constraints. The enabling factors are congruent with Martin's anal- ysis. Contemporary individuals are born into cultures that are replete with social practices, organizations, and beliefs that orient them toward the future (e.g., ed- ucational systems, hierarchical work organizations, fi- nancial savings plans). These contemporary cultural tools, which direct people's attention to the future and facilitate their efforts to prepare for it, are much more prevalent in today's complex societies. Constraints, in contrast, received little attention from Martin (this issue). Even though our pre-Holocene ancestors were cognitively capable of long-term planning, they faced technological and soci- etal constraints that may have made it nearly impossi- ble for them to invest much energy in long-term goals. As a result, their behaviors, and the archeological re- cord they left, may underestimate their abilities to cognize delayed outcomes. We consider a few of these constraints here. One is the nomadic nature of most hunter-gatherer societies. It would make little sense for a group of people who move from one place to an- other, and who may rarely return to old habitats, to in- vest energy in the construction of permanent physical markers such as gravestones. Another constraint is the simple lack of leisure time. In hunter-gatherer societ- ies, food acquisition and preparation alone takes about 40 hr per week (Hawkes, O'Connell, &amp; Blurton Jones, 1997). Once one adds in time for other routine tasks, for protecting oneself from predators, for coping with illness and other calamities, and for the occasional move from one site to another, there simply may be lit- tle time left for individuals to "[invest] in artifacts and social relations" even if they were inclined to do so. Consider a hypothetical group of contemporary indi- viduals who are dropped into the Savannah. Although they are equipped with delayed-return abilities, their circumstances might force them to devote most of their time to obtaining food, shelter, and other immediate needs. They might ruminate about a better future, but the demands of day-to-day life would focus their activ- ities on the present. Other constraints are technological. To illustrate, consider burial practices. As Martin (this issue) notes, hunter-gatherer's graves are relatively shallow. But it is also true that their grave-digging implements are rather rudimentary. The shallowness of graves may not solely indicate a disinterest in death and the afterlife, but a technological obstacle that combines with a rela- tive lack of free time. In principle, if one computed the amount of time devoted to burial as a percentage of free time available to members of a society, cultural variations might narrow considerably. Immediate-return hunter-gatherer societies also contain social norms that constrain the behavior of an individual who otherwise might pursue self-serving long-term goals. Among the Hazda of Tanzania, there exist substantial societal sanctions on the accumula- tion of personal assets (Woodburn, 1982). Individuals who insist on accumulating property are driven out of the camp. If an individual tries to grow crops for his own use, other members of the society generally will raid his field before he can harvest them (Woodburn, 1982). Thus, the individual may be cognitively ori- ented toward delayed returns, but actions in this direc- tion are frustrated. Multiple aspects of hunter-gatherer societies, then, may constrain goal-directed behavior and the making of long-term investments. Such constraints may exist in other forms of social organization as well. For exam- ple, socialist regimes have been described as preclud- ing opportunities for expression of personal goals and desires (Locke, 1994). Locke contended that "under socialism the individual is free to think about what goals he would like to pursue if he were free to do so, but he is not free to implement those thoughts in action, except at the risk of his freedom and his life" (p. 169). Similar to the societal sanctions on accumulation of as- sets that are practiced among the Hazda hunter-gather- ers, Locke maintained that socialism "prevents people from setting and pursuing goals that will lead them to 211</page><page sequence="4">COMMENTARIES productiveness and wealth" (p. 170). Similar patterns may be found in autocratic-totalitarian regimes, and Marxists would suggest that capitalism constrains the self-directedness and personal development of work- ers. Further, women the world over are prevented from pursuing personal long-term goals and instead are forced to engage in activities that provide immediate feedback, yet that might not be personally fulfilling. People facing these sociopolitical forces may not be thinking in the phenomenal present, even though they may unable to direct their actions to self-determined long-term goals. I-D Compensation Theory We have focused on particular aspects of Martin's I-D compensation theory that, in our judgment, need further development: the definition of delayed-return abilities, the reconciling of the theory with archeolog- ical evidence, and the consideration of external con- straints on goal-directed action by persons who are cognitively capable of contemplating the future and regulating their behavior toward long-term objec- tives. In emphasizing these points, we thus far have fallen victim to a pervasive tendency among com- mentators: overlooking the strengths of an article. Martin's emphasis of feedback processes in achieve- ment and satisfaction is surely valuable; his argu- ments here are supported not only by the literatures Martin cites but by extensive research in goal theory (Locke &amp; Latham, 1990) and social-cognitive analy- ses of personality, motivation, and self-regulatory processes (reviewed in Bandura, 1986, 1997; Caprara &amp; Cervone, in press; Cervone &amp; Shoda, 1999). I-D compensation theory's analysis of dynamic psycho- logical processes that mediate goal pursuit also is most welcome. It illuminates cognitive mechanisms underlying goal-directed action that might be ob- scured if behavior were explained solely by reference to broad "motive" constructs whose cognitive and af- fective underpinnings were unspecified. We have emphasized perceived limitations in Martin's (this issue) analysis in part to make a broader point. In recent years, social and personality psychologists have expanded the scope of their in- quiry. We increasingly incorporate into our analyses sociocultural factors that shape personal development and moderate the functioning of social-cognitive and affective processes (e.g., Kitayama &amp; Markus, 1999; Triandis, 1994). No development is more important to our field. Broadening our focus, however, brings added responsibility. We must attend carefully not only to the findings of our own discipline, but to those of our intellectual neighbors who we tended to ignore in the past. Continued progress, as Geertz (1973) foretold, "demands a joint attack from virtu- ally all the behavioral sciences, in which the findings of each will force continual theoretical reassessments upon all of the others" (p. 83).
