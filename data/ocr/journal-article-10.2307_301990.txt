<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Psychology of the Emotions in Britain and America in the Nineteenth Century The Role of Religious and Antireligious Commitments By Thomas Dixon* INTRODUCTION In 1884, a piece of verse entitled Our Modern Philosophers: Darwin, Bain and Spencer, or The Descent of Man, Mind and Body; A Rhyme with Reasons, Essays, Notes and Quotations was published under the pseudonym "Psychosis." (At this time, the terms "neurosis" and "psychosis" did not refer to mental disorders; "neuro- sis" simply meant "brain state,' and "psychosis" referred to the correlated mental state.) The author started by noting that these three modem philosophers were per- ceived by "nine-tenths of the Christian world" as enemies of religion: Three men of genius and free-thought, An intellectual synod, In conclave sat to bring to naught The works and government of God. Says Darwin: 'God did not make man, To demonstrate I'll prove this;' Says Spencer: 'Since the world began, God's government has gone amiss;' 'By my hypothesis,' says Bain, 'Man's immortality's a myth-his soul's his brain." Psychosis himself rejected this idea of a conflict between science and religion. He also denied, at least in the cases of Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer, that anti- * Faculty of Divinity, Cambridge UK CB3 9BS, and Churchill College, Cambridge UK CB3 ODS I am grateful to the British Academy for their support in the form of a Postdoctoral Fellowship.

Indeed, Psychosis saw no necessary link at all between the acceptance of physiologi- cal and evolutionary psychologies on the one hand and the denial or acceptance of traditional religious beliefs on the other. More than a century later, historians have made little progress in providing evi- dence with which to answer Psychosis' question: Were psychological theories of the nineteenth century, or were they not, shaped by their authors' religious views? In- deed, few have even posed the question. Historiography on science-and-religion has focused mainly on physics and biology and much less frequently on psychology, while historians of psychology have tended, in their desire to find precursors to con- temporary psychologies, to produce rather narrow histories that overlook the im- pacts made by religious and antireligious views on past psychologies.2 In this essay I take the historiographical discussion forward by setting out some concrete criteria by which evidence for causal, explanatory links between religious attitudes and psy- chological theories can be evaluated. Having set out these criteria, I put the historiographical theory into practice in a case study of theories of emotions in Britain and America in the nineteenth century. I examine the evidence, first of all, for the claim that the replacement of the old categories of "passions and affections of the soul" with the new nineteenth-century concept of "emotions" was motivated by hostility to traditional religious beliefs. Here I make a particular study of two Scottish theorists of the mind: the Edinburgh philosopher Thomas Brown (1778-1820), who was responsible for introducing the new concept of emotions, and the psychologist Alexander Bain (1818-1903). Next, I ask whether the content of certain later emotions theories can be explained by an appeal to their authors' prior Christian commitments. The central figures here are two American "preacher-psychologists": James McCosh (1811-1894) and George Trumbull Ladd (1842-1921). (The religious beliefs with which the actors in this story were engaged were predominantly those of one form or another of Anglo- American Protestant Christianity.) At first glance, the case of the shift from talk of passions and affections to talk of emotions seems to provide strong evidence of a connection between religious and psychological preferences.' To speak of "passions and affections of the soul" was to embed one's thought in a network of distinctively Christian concepts and categories. In contrast, the category of "emotions" was alien to traditional Christian thought and was part of a newer and more secular network of words and ideas. No one (to my knowledge) ever wrote a work called The Psychology of the Passions nor one called The Emotions of the Soul. This simple observation highlights an important fact about the way that these terms derived their meanings from networks of related concepts. The words "passions" and "affections" belonged to a network of words 2 For exceptions to this general rule, however, see Stephen Jacyna, "The Physiology of Mind, the Unity of Nature, and the Moral Order in Victorian Thought," Brit. J. Hist. Sci. 14 (1981):109-32; John Milbank, Theology and Social Theory: Beyond Secular Reason (Oxford: Blackwell, 1990); Richard Webster, Why Freud was wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis (London: Harper Collins, 1995); Edward Reed, From Soul to Mind: The Emergence of Psychology from Erasmus Darwin to William James (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1997). This shift in terminology is the focus of my doctoral dissertation, which traces the shift from eighteenth-century Christian writers to the works of William James and his critics at the end of the nineteenth century.

The word "emotions" was, from the outset, part of a different network of terms such as "psychology," "law," "observation," "evolution:" "organism," "brain:' "nerves:' "expression:" "behavior" and "viscera." While antireligious, and merely nonreligious psychologists were not the only ones to use the word "emotions," they did so sooner and integrated the category into their psychologies more readily than did their Christian contemporaries. The secular triumvirate picked out by Psychosis of Darwin, Bain, and Spencer were among these early emotions theorists. Christian writers, especially in more conservative environ- ments such as Oxford and Cambridge (and some American colleges) continued to use the terms "will," "passions," "affections," and "sentiments" much more than the term "emotions." There was, then, a correlation between the adoption of the new emotions discourse on the one hand, and lack of traditional Christian belief on the other. There was also a correlation, later in the century, when the transition to emo- tions talk had become a fait accompli, between Christian faith and the adoption of cognitive and antireductionist theories of emotions. RELIGION AND PSYCHOLOGY: SOME REFLECTIONS ON WORLDVIEWS, EXPLANATIONS, AND EVIDENCE Many obstacles stand in the way of the historian's attempt to take correlations such as those between particular religious commitments and particular emotions theories and turn them into causal explanations. There are many other possible interpreta- tions of such correlations; the causal explanation that the theories in question were directly shaped by religious attitudes is not the only option. For example, it is pos- sible that, freed from the constraints of an old-fashioned religious typology, psycho- logical thinkers such as Brown and Bain could see that the new category of "emo- tions" provided a better delineation of mental states such as love, joy, hope, fear, anger, and the like than had the old categories of passions and affections. On this view, their religious attitudes would not be directly linked with the content of their theories. The correlation on its own does not provide sufficient evidence to make the claim that religious or antireligious views played a causal role. Furthermore, as John Brooke and Stephen J. Wykstra both note in their contribu- tions to the present volume, the historian should not too quickly take the defense of certain philosophical or metaphysical positions to be evidence of an author's reli- gious or antireligious views, in the absence of further evidence. (See John Brooke, "Religious Belief and the Content of the Sciences," and Stephen J. Wykstra, "Reli- gious Beliefs, Metaphysical Beliefs, and Historiography of Science.") So, for example, nineteenth-century authors' metaphysical commitments to mind-body du- alism on the one hand, or to a reductionist materialism about mind on the other, did not always have a religious or antireligious flavor, although they very often did. We should also distinguish anti-religious beliefs from merely non-religious ("atheologi- cal" or "extra-Christian") metaphysical beliefs.4 The absence of a theological per- spective from a particular text by no means entails that its author was an atheist. The 4I have written more extensively on the differences between theological, antitheological, and atheological views in Thomas Dixon, "Theology, Anti-Theology, and Atheology: From Christian Passions to Secular Emotions:" Modern Theology 15 (1999):297-330.</page><page sequence="4">PSYCHOLOGY OF THE EMOTIONS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 291 new emotions discourse of the mid-nineteenth century, for example, could perhaps be seen as a merely nonreligious or atheological psychological categorization rather than as an actively antireligious one. Again taking Brooke's and Wykstra's remarks as starting points, I agree that it is useful to think of individuals' a priori religious or nonreligious metaphysical com- mitments as comprising their worldviews.5 Three essential components of a world- view are (1) assumptions about the nature of reality (ontological commitments); (2) assumptions about how best to acquire knowledge about reality (epistemological commitments); and (3) commitments to particular textual and metaphorical resources as the best way to articulate knowledge of reality (narrative and explana- tory commitments). To take some examples, a Christian worldview might assume that God is the ground and cause of all reality, that revelation and reason are the two principal sources of knowledge about that reality, and that the Bible provides some of the best ways of explaining and narrating human reality. A secular-scientific worldview might assume matter or nature to be the ultimate reality, might privilege experimentation as the way to discover the nature of that reality, and might look to natural history and mathematics for narrative and explanatory tools. I do not wish to suggest that there is just one Christian worldview, nor that there is just one scientific worldview; these examples are simply illustrative. This use of the idea of a "worldview" is in accord with the "symmetrical" way in which Wykstra has applied the concept: "[W]orldview-sensitive construction of scientific guiding commitments has played an important role over the past three centuries," he argues, for "theistic and nontheistic scientists alike."6 The approach I take here is also a deliberately symmetrical one, in which worldviews, which might be broadly religious, antireli- gious. or merely metaphysical, can influence theory choice and can shape the con- tent of a theory. In other words, I intend to approach the question of the shaping of cognitive content evenhandedly; I see no prima facie reason to suppose that either religious or antireligious psychological thinkers were more likely to produce theo- ries shaped by their prior metaphysical commitments. The appeal to worldviews raises further issues about evidence and explanation. There is a danger that an appeal to a writer's worldview could be vacuous if "worldview" simply meant whatever assumptions seemed to lie behind the theory in question. It is essential that evidence external to the theory in question is adduced as evidence of its author's worldview. Even then the worldview itself stands in need of explanation: it is not an explanatory terminus (as, indeed, nothing is), although in some circumstances it might be as far as the historian can go down a particular line. It is at this stage that all the rich and complex psychological, social, cultural, political, economic, and geographical facts investigated in any "contextual" history need to be brought to bear. Reasons for inhabiting one worldview rather than another may often be complex and deep-seated. These are all reasons for employing caution and rigor when looking for evi- dence that the content of a theory can be explained with reference to worldview I For further discussion of the worldview produced by scientific writers in the nineteenth and twen- tieth centuries, see Dixon, "Atheology" (cit. n. 4), especially pp. 314-25. 6 Stephen Wykstra, "Should Worldviews Shape Science?

What sort of evidence might the historian hope to find to substantiate such a claim? Starting with the weakest sort of evidence and ascending toward the strongest, at least five levels can be differentiated: Level 1. Prima facie compatibility between the content of the theory and the religious or antireligious view in question. Level 2. Level 1 plus evidence external to the theory of its author's commitment to the religious or antireligious view in question. Level 3. Level 2 plus an explicit statement by the author (stronger evidence) or by his or her associates or contemporaries (weaker evidence) of the compatibility between the theory and the religious or antireligious view in question. Level 4. Level 3, where the statement is to the effect that the religious or antire- ligious view actually influenced the way in which the author con- structed the theory (as opposed to the relation being merely coinci- dental). Level 5. Level 4, corroborated by several different sources (i.e., the statement that the author's religious or antireligious views shaped his or her theory is made several times in different texts and/or by several differ- ent people, including the author). This incomplete list of possible levels of evidence relates to claims that the content of a theory has been shaped by its author's religious or antireligious commitments, which is a separate issue from whether the theory was subsequently taken up by other authors as part of a pro- or antireligious campaign. I am concerned in this essay only with the first sort of claim. I should also add an apology at the outset that virtually none of the evidence that I present concerning the content of theories of emotions reaches beyond level 3. It will still be of value to have levels 4 and 5 in mind as higher levels of evidence to which to aspire. One of my goals in presenting this list of increasingly demanding levels of evi- dence is to draw attention to the amount that is lacking from an account that rests content primarily with level 1, primafacie compatibility. Elsewhere, I have criticized this tendency in accounts of the influence of theological thought on psychological and social theory offered by John Milbank, Richard Webster, and Edward Reed.7 Evidence of mere prima facie compatibility of prior worldview commitments with the content of psychological texts can be strengthened, even in the absence of further external evidence, by seeking broad trends rather than concentrating on isolated examples; that is, by looking for correlations between types of religious and antireli- gious commitments and types of theory, rather than a clearly articulated chain of cause and effect in each individual case. This may be the best way to proceed when one finds oneself lacking conclusive biographical or autobiographical evidence.

I also present detailed biographical information about the proponents of psychologi- cal theories that constitutes evidence from levels 2, 3, and, occasionally, 4. One final approach is geographical.' Each of the psychological thinkers discussed here was conditioned by local social, academic, institutional, and intellectual cir- cumstances. For example, the term "emotions" was taken up earlier by Scottish writ- ers familiar with Brown's lectures (e.g., Thomas Chalmers, James Mackintosh) than it was by most English writers. In particular, English writers in Oxford and Cam- bridge were slow to make the transition and persisted with their use of the language of "passions" and "affections" into the second half of the century. Within Britain, it was London-based writers such as Spencer and Bain who did most to transform the concept of emotions from a mentalistic to a physicalist one. London, rather than Scotland, Oxford, or Cambridge, was the center of the most radical British thought, including physiological psychological thought, in the middle of the nineteenth cen- tury.9 Finally, it was perhaps due to local factors in New England that James McCosh, George T. Ladd, and others were able to combine professional Christian ministry with professional psychology in a way that was not found in Britain. These local geographical factors are clearly significant, and I will make a few more obser- vations about them in the course of the narrative below. FROM PASSIONS AND AFFECTIONS TO EMOTIONS: A CASE STUDY The distinction between the soul's unruly passions and its enlightened affections had been a commonplace of medieval theological psychology and continued to be used by theologians and philosophers up until the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This distinction was adopted, for example, in the Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections (1728) by the Scottish neo-Scholastic philosopher Francis Hutcheson (1694-1746), and in the Treatise Concerning the Religious Af- fections (1746) by the New England minister and philosopher Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758).'? Even in the nineteenth century the Scottish evangelical Thomas Chalmers (1780-1847), the Cambridge Anglican polymath William Whewell (1794-1866), and Oxford conservatives such as William Sewell (1804-1874) and John Henry Newman (1801-1890) all showed a familiarity with the traditional dis- tinction between the "passions" (or, sometimes, "desires") and the "affections."11 8 David Livingstone's comparative study of the reception of Darwinian science in Belfast, Ireland, and Princeton, New Jersey, in the United States, in the 1 870s and 1 880s, has illustrated the value of the geographical approach particularly well. He concludes, "By thus taking the history and the geog- raphy of science and religion seriously, we may begin to escape the temptation to prefer comfortable idealizations and simplifications to the messy contingencies of history."

In his Dissertation Mackintosh had recom- mended referring to the "emotive" part of human nature and to "the emotions'" These terminological innovations were not welcomed by Whewell, who felt that the phrases "passions and affections" or "desires and affections" were perfectly ade- quate to refer to that part of human nature, and that they did not stand in need of replacement by neologisms.2 So, while some Scottish mental scientists and their followers were increasingly using Thomas Brown's new category of emotions, con- servative English thinkers were still committed to more traditional and Christian language. A brief step back to the medieval works of Augustine and Aquinas re- veals the origins of the critical distinction between the soul's passions and its af- fections to which Whewell and others continued to appeal. The will and the intellect were the two great faculties of the classical Christian soul as described in the psychologies of Saint Augustine of Hippo and Saint Thomas Aquinas. The will was further divided into two parts: the higher, intellectual will (the will proper), whose movements were the affections; and the lower, nonrational, animal, or sensory will, whose movements were the appetites, desires, and passions. The appetites were hunger, thirst, and sexual desire. The passions included love, hate, hope, fear, and anger. Appetites and passions were both seen as instances of the lower animal soul and the body being unruly and disobedient toward the higher rational soul. They were thus interpreted as signs of and punishments for the original sinful disobedience of Adam and Eve toward God; they were signs of the Fall. (The term "passion'" was also used, as it still is, to refer to the suffering and death of Christ.) The higher affections of love, sympathy, and joy were understood by Augustine and Aquinas to be signs of the divine side, rather than the fallen side, of human nature. These affections, like reason itself, showed that human beings still contained vestiges of the image of God in which they had been created, and that they could finally be saved and reunited with God. The affections were also interpreted as signs of the order or direction of the will. A carnal will was affected by worldly objects and, ultimately, by love of self; a holy will's affections were for goodness, truth and, ultimately, God.'4 Prior to the emergence of the category of emotions, the language of passions and affections was used by both religious and nonreligious writers on human mental life. Secular moralists and literary writers, as well as more explicitly theological and religious writers on the faculties of the soul, used these terms. Nevertheless, this distinction and these concepts did derive historically from theological psychologies and were well suited to a Christian understanding of the human person. Additionally, 12 See Whewell's footnotes to Mackintosh, Dissertation (cit. n. 11), pp. xlv, 79.

It is, then, a difficult task to distinguish between writings that should be interpreted simply as examples of "traditional" or "old-fashioned" thought about mental life, and those that should be described as distinctively "religious" or "Christian." This is where, again, we must look for evidence external to the theory itself of the religious or antireligious commitments of the author. The "Thin Theist": Thomas Brown (1778-1820) Thomas Brown's Lectures on the Philosophy of the Human Mind (1820) was the single most important work in introducing the term "emotions" as a major psycho- logical category to the academic and literary worlds during the first half of the nine- teenth century. Brown was a pivotal figure in the history of English-language affective psychologies (Figure 1). A doctor of medicine and professor of moral phi- losophy in the University of Edinburgh, his Lectures were very broadly within the same tradition as the Common Sense school of Thomas Reid (1710-1796) and Du- gald Stewart (1753-1828). However, unlike his intuitionist and realist predecessors, Brown was sympathetic to the empiricist associationism of David Hume (1711- 1776) and David Hartley (1705-1757) (although-ever the terminological innova- tor Brown preferred the term "suggestion" to "association").'5 His philosophy tended much more toward skepticism and relativism than did that of Reid and Stewart. Brown's Lectures was one of the most successful philosophy books of the period, going through twenty editions between 1820 and 1860.16 James McCosh and the historian of philosophy and psychologist J. D. Morell (1816-1891) (who attended Brown's Edinburgh lectures himself) both paint vivid pictures, in their histories of philosophy, of Brown's charisma as well as of the enormous influence of his lectures in Britain and America between 1820 and 1850.'7 15 Thomas Brown, Lectures on the Philosophy of the Human Mind, 19th ed., 4 vols.

Reid, writing in 1788. and his pupil James Beattie (1735- 1803), writing in 1790, while making occasional ill-defined references to "emotion," had relied almost exclusively on the traditional categories of "passions" (desires and aversions connected with bodily commotion) and milder "affections," as derived particularly from Aquinas via the reformed Scholasticism of Scottish Enlightenment figures such as Hutcheson."8 Dugald Stewart, Brown's predecessor in the Edinburgh lx For an account of the traditional categories as exposed by Aquinas, see the Summa Theologiae Ia.82, 5 and Ia.2ae.22-7: Francis Hutcheson, An Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections, 3rd ed.

The fact that several early writers on "emotions" from the 1820s onward made explicit reference to Brown's definition and classification of the emotions is further evidence of the im- portance of Brown's innovation2 Intellect, the Emotions and the Moral Nature (1855) by the Edinburgh-educated William Lyall (1811-1890) was one of the first books by a North American teacher to have the term "emotions" in its title. Signifi- cantly, Lyall's philosophy was summarized by an obituarist as "a modification of Brown's."2' Views on Religion and Natural Science The internal textual evidence of Brown's Lectures suggests a very thin and superfi- cial sort of religious commitment. His references to God or the soul were few, and his use of terms such as "divine Being,' "Preserver of Nature," "Author of Nature," "Eternal One," and "divine Author" were indicative of his preference for natural over revealed religion; his text had no theological depth and relied exclusively on metaphysics in preference to Scripture and tradition.'2 Six of the one hundred lec- tures were devoted to Brown's natural religion. In these the Deity was described, in a Unitarian and Deistic way, as single, good, and omniscient, "the one designing Power"23 whose existence was known by inference from the natural world. There were no references to Scripture, to the Fall, to Christ, to the Holy Spirit, to grace, to sin, to salvation; in short, there was no Christianity. We can also seek evidence of Brown's religious commitments in sources other than his own Lectures. We know from his biographer, Rev. David Welsh, and from other sources, that Brown was opposed to religious tests for holders of academic posts. He was particularly hostile to the practice, in Scotland, of electing only cler- gymen of the Presbyterian Church to chairs. He even published a pamphlet on the question, in support of the layman John Leslie's candidature for the chair in natural philosophy in opposition to the candidate of the moderate party of the Church.

Brown's pamphlet defended Leslie against the charge that Hume's theory of causation led to atheism; so Deist and evangelical were united by their desire to see a Humean, and a layman, elected to the chair of natural philosophy.24 These intricacies aside, the practice of favoring clergymen in competi- tions for academic posts, in fact, proved a significant obstacle to Brown's own even- tual appointment as the professor of moral philosophy in Edinburgh in 1810, since he was a mere doctor of medicine rather than of divinity and was not a cleric.25 The only explicit reference Welsh's memoir made to Brown's views on religion was to describe his attitude as "[lthe most perfect toleration of all religious opinions." We can discover some evidence of the sort described as level (3) above by looking at the testimony of contemporaries or near-contemporaries of Brown. In works writ- ten between the l 820s and 1900 Brown is repeatedly accused of having allegiances with "materialist" and "atheist" beliefs, especially French sensationalism, phrenol- ogy, the denial of efficient causation, necessitarianism, and positivism.27 Thomas Chalmers, although following Brown's view of emotions to a large extent, felt that Brown, as well as failing to treat of revelation, had "very low and inadequate views of the character of God."28 I am not suggesting that such opinions as these are infalli- ble, but in this case there is a good deal of evidence that contemporaries and near- contemporaries of Brown believed that he had been committed to views inimical to Christian faith, and that these views had shaped his mental science (whereas no one suggested that his mental science was shaped by Christian religious commitments). Brown's personal and professional alienation from the Christian religion and the Christian establishment in Scotland led to his search for alternative authorities and methods in his philosophical work.

In 1797 he, along with a handful of like-minded fellow students in Edinburgh such as Henry Brougham (1778-1868), Francis Horner (1778-1817), and Francis Jeffrey (1773-1850) (all of whom were later involved in founding the Edinburgh Review) had formed a philosophical club called the Academy of Phys- iCS.29 Its purpose, according to Brougham, was to apply "the Newtonian philosophy" to "every subject to which induction and reasoning can be applied."3"1 One of the subjects for investigation laid down in the minutes of the academy's first meeting was "The physics of mind, or the philosophy of mind, excluding religious controver- sies and party politics."3' This is valuable evidence of Brown's prior commitment to the construction of a de-Christianized psychology modeled on the physics of matter; this commitment was a major component of what could be called his "worldview," which shaped his mental science and can partially explain the form and content of his theory of emotions. Browns Psychological Systemn Returning to Brown's lectures, we find evidence of how his commitment to the meth- ods of natural science shaped his psychology. Brown termed his mental philosophy variously "physiology of the mind," "mental chemistry," "mental science," "intellec- tual physics:' and even "the physical investigation of the mind."32 However, Brown's "mental science;' like that of moderates such as Reid and Stewart as well as that of the associationists Hume, David Hartley (1705-1757) and James Mill (1773-1836), was a purely mentalistic and introspective discipline.33 It was a science, like chem- istry or physiology, in that it analyzed the whole into parts, classified those parts, and described the dynamics of their interaction. But it was not a physical science: it simply analyzed and classified mental phenomena qua mental phenomena. Leslie Stephen (1832-1904) provided the following summary, in his 1900 History of En- glish Utilitarians: "We may then say briefly that Brown carries out in his own fash- ion the conception of psychology which makes it an inductive science parallel to the physical sciences, and to be pursued by the same methods. We have to do with 'feelings' instead of atoms, and with mental instead of 'material' chemistry."34 Brown's mental science sought to discover the "natural laws of thought and emo- tion."35 Sensations, thoughts, and emotions connected in chains of cause and effect 29 Welsh, Account (cit. n. 27), pp. 498-506; Susan A.

This brings us to Brown's classification of mental states. It is significant that it was a classification of mental states (or "feelings" or "affections" of the mind, as he also called them) rather than of powers or faculties of the soul. Brown was icono- clastic in his approach to previous classificatory schemes. He gave short shrift to the classical division endorsed by Christian theologians between the understanding and the will "a division which is very ancient, but though sanctioned by the approba- tion of many ages, very illogical" and argued that Reid's division between the intellectual powers and the active powers of the mind was really just the same system "under a change of name."36 Brown was a self-confessed and enthusiastic innovator, seeing new classificatory schemes and terminologies as sources of enlightenment in themselves: [T]here is always some advantage gained, by viewing objects according to new circum- stances of agreement or analogy. We see, in this case, what had long passed before us unobserved, while we were accustomed only to the order and nomenclature of a former method.... I am convinced that no one has ever read over the mere terms of a new division in a science, however familiar the science may have been to him, without learn- ing more than this new division itself, without being struck with some property or rela- tion, the importance of which he now perceives most clearly, and which he is quite astonished that he should have overlooked so long before.37 Although a new terminology in mental science could thus have a powerful effect on one's view of mental reality, Brown went on to warn that it should not be read as an invention of new powers, faculties, or substances but merely as a new way of classi- fying the modifications of the mind. He continued, "A difference of words is, in this case, more than a mere verbal difference. Though it be not the expression of a differ- ence of doctrine, it very speedily becomes So."38 This observation about the potential effects of introducing new terminology applies particularly well to Brown's own introduction of the new psychological term "emotions." This difference in words very speedily, as a result of its association with Brown's commitments to a proto- positivist philosophy of science and to a "mental science" methodology, became not just a verbal difference but a difference of doctrine. Immediately after giving this analysis of the possible effects of introducing new terminology, in Lecture 16, Brown introduced his new classification of mental phenomena into sensations, thoughts, and emotions (summarized in Table 1). The states of mind were first reduced by Brown to two classes, "according as the causes, or immediate antecedents, of our feelings are themselves mental or mate- rial."39 The causes of "external affections" (sensations) were material objects acting on the sensory organs; the causes of "internal affections" were mental feelings (ei- ther sensations or other internal affections). Brown introduced one of his "new gen- eralizations of the phenomena of each class" by dividing the internal affections into 36 Lectures, vol. 1, pp. 391-2. 17 Lectures, vol. 1, pp. 395-6.

J. D. Morell was strongly opposed to this replacement of the language of powers and faculties with the language of intellectual states and emotions: The tendency of this exchange is most evidently of a sensational character; it diminishes the intensity of our notion of self, as an independent source of power, and contemplates the mind rather as a passive existence, moulded into its different states either by the force of circumstances on the one hand, or by its own inevitable and unalterable laws on the other.4' This criticism was essentially sound: talking only of mental states rather than of the mind and importing epistemological and ontological assumptions from the physical sciences did give rise to a passive and necessitarian psychology. Brown himself gave three reasons for his change of terminology from "active powers" to "emotions": first, that he found the term "active powers" awkward and ambiguous; second, that intellectual states were the really active states of mind; and third, that he wished to include in his category of emotions many states that were not active-such as grief or astonishment-and some also that had traditionally but wrongly been considered intellectual powers, such as the feelings of beauty and sublimity.42 Interpretation of the Evidence Brown himself offered no religious or antireligious rationale for the change in lan- guage, which is why we must rely on a mixture of prima facie textual evidence and external evidence of Brown's commitment to nonreligious mental science, and on 40 Lectures, vol. 1, p. 403. 41 Morell, Speculative Philosophy (cit. n. 17), vol. 2, p. 27. 42 Lectures, vol. 1, p. 404.</page><page sequence="15">302 THOMAS DIXON the testimony of his biographer and other historians, when it comes to speculating about the significance of the introduction of Brownian "emotions." My interpreta- tion of the evidence is that social and personal circumstances, including Brown's membership in the Academy of Physics and his resentment of Church interference in academic appointments led to his alienation from traditional religious beliefs. In the place of religious metaphysics in Brown's "mental science," we find a firm commitment to ontological and epistemological beliefs derived from physics and chemistry. Brown had a marked preference for descriptions and explanations of mental states that used the language and concepts of these sciences rather than of Christianity. He was relying on the language of the natural sciences to create an alternative to the neo-Scholastic Christian psychology of Reid and Stewart. The re- sult was that the active powers of the soul disappeared from his ontology and were replaced with emotions, which were not movements of the will or intellect but were ontologically basic atoms of feeling. Thus the change of terminology from Reid's and Stewart's active powers to Brown's emotions was more than a mere verbal dif- ference. In later texts on mental science and psychology, Brown's influence was evident in the adoption of five of his teachings in particular: 1. Adoption of "mental science" methodology. This methodology was divided into two tasks: first, analyzing mental states into their components ("mental chemistry"), and second, discovering the laws of succession of mental states ("mental physics"). 2. The division of mental phenomena into "sensations," "thoughts," and "emo- tions." 3. The statement that "emotions" could not be given a precise definition but were distinguished by a peculiar vividness of feeling. 4. The distinction between "sensations," which are feelings with external bod- ily causes, and "emotions," which are feelings with internal mental causes. 5. Classification of the emotions as "retrospective," "immediate," and "prospec- tive.' The later nineteenth-century writers who most showed their indebtedness to Brown by adopting some or all of these positions were the Congregationalist divine George Payne (1781-1848), the associationist psychologist James Mill and his son John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), the evangelicals Thomas Chalmers and Thomas Upham (1799-1872), the Scottish aristocrat and philosophical writer Sir George Ramsay (1800-1871), the Scottish-Canadian minister William Lyall, Herbert Spencer (1820- 1903), Alexander Bain, and James McCosh.43 To the extent that these thinkers adopted 43 Payne, Elements (cit. n. 20); Mill, Analysis (cit. n. 33); Chalmers, Power, Wisdom, and Goodness (cit. n.

The "Infidel": Alexander Bain (1818-1903) It was certainly the view of Psychosis that the Scottish philosopher and psychologist Alexander Bain played a crucial role in the world of Victorian scientific atheism. Bain, more than either Darwin or Spencer (both of whom had shown at least some degree of sympathy with certain "religious" beliefs), was associated by the author of Our Modern Philosophers with materialism and religious dissent. I hope to dem- onstrate here, focusing on Bain in particular, that the endorsement of physiological and evolutionary approaches to mind was indeed, in part, anti-Christian. Bain's widely used textbooks, The Senses and the Intellect (1855) and The Emotions and the Will (1 859) (along with Darwin's The Expression of the Emotions [11872], the relevant sections of the expanded second edition of Spencer's The Principles of Psy- chologv [1 870-1872], and the latter's essays on Bain and on the physiology of laugh- ter) were particularly significant vehicles of the physiological-evolutionary approach to mind in general and to the emotions in particular (Figure 2). Bain's theory of the emotions was effectively a correlation of Brown's extremely broad new category with neurophysiological processes. During 1837, Bain had pe- rused Brown's Lectures.45 He would, however, have become familiar with Brown's term "emotion" through his much more extensive studies of Chalmers' work, espe- cially his Bridgewater Treatise, which Bain had used as a textbook for some of his early teaching.46 The beginning of the first chapter of the first edition of Bain's Emo- tions (1859) is as good an indication as any of the very wide range of the category of "emotions," which he had adopted from Brown via Chalmers: "Emotion is the name here used to comprehend all that is understood by feelings, states of feeling, pleasures, pains, passions, sentiments, affections."47 Thus Bain and the other "infi- del" psychologists sought to physicalize a whole array of human mental powers, many of which had previously been considered distinctively human powers of the soul that were not shared with animals and were not determined by the body. The question is to what extent the content of the new physicalist emotions theories can be explained with reference to their authors' religious or antireligious world- view commitments. I will start with some of the fundamental commitments of the "infidel" psychologists of emotions and examine how they may have shaped their idem, Principles of Psychology (London: Walton and Maberly, 1857); William Lyall, Sermons (Edin- burgh: Johnstone, 1848); idem, Intellect (cit. n. 20); Herbert Spencer, Principles of Psychology, 2nd ed., 2 vols.

The most important of these commitments were to monism, man-animal continuism, and to the rejection of design theology. Monisin Bain, Spencer, and Darwin all opposed mind-body dualism. Bain explicitly attacked the view (espoused by most Christians and theists) that the mind used the body as its "instrument."1481 However, most of the physiological school equally denied that mind could be reduced to the operations of matter or was nothing more than matter. Instead they adopted an ontology of dual-aspect monism (or Spinozism). This meant that there was an unknown reality that underlay both physical and mental phenom- ena. Bain talked of giving an account of the physical "side" as well as the mental 48Alexander Bain, Mind and Bod!. The Theories of Their Relation (London: King, 1873). pp. 132-3.</page><page sequence="18">PSYCHOLOGY OF THE EMOTIONS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 305 "side" of each emotion: the bodily symptoms of an emotion were the physical side of the mental fact.49 So, dual-aspect monism involved, in theory, making a commitment to a symmetri- cal and nonreductionist ontology; the dual-aspect monist did not reduce mental phe- nomena either to mere brain activity, in the manner of the materialist, nor to the properties of an autonomous mind, in the manner of the idealist or spiritualist. How- ever, Bain, along with Spencer and Darwin, implied by his methodology and lan- guage that the real business of emotions went on at the physiological and neurologi- cal level. The implication was that emotions were the mental "side" of what was really and objectively an activity of the central nervous system. For example, Bain, in Body and Mind (1873), described fear as follows: "When a shock of fear paralyses the digestion, it is not the emotion of fear, in the abstract, or as a pure mental exis- tence, that does the harm; it is the emotion in company with a peculiarly excited condition of the brain and nervous system; and it is this condition of the brain that deranges the stomach."50 While the "emotion" was the mentalfeeling rather than the bodily conditions, which were the physical "side" of the emotion, the tenor of the piece was physicalist. The "shock of fear,' which disturbed the digestion, was ulti- mately not the abstract "pure mental existence" but the "condition of the brain." Theodore Mischel has also noticed the lopsidedness of Bain's professed monism: Bain made psychological explanations parasitic upon physiological ones in terms of "nervous influences."5 Among the causes of this lopsidedness were Bain's particular epistemological commitments. He favored an observational methodology that made objective knowl- edge of outward signs paramount in psychology: But for our purposes, and for all purposes, two states of feeling must be held as identical when an identity exists between all the appearances. actions, and consequences that flow from, or accompany them. If there be any peculiar shade, tone, or colouring of emotion that has no outward sign or efficacy, such peculiarity is inscrutable to the in- quirer. It is enough for us to lay hold of the outward manifestations, and to recognise all the distinctions that they bring to light. Bain's ideal psychological investigator would categorize emotions only by their ob- jectively observable outward signs. This epistemological commitment was an inver- sion of most traditional Christian approaches. Jonathan Edwards, for example, in his Treatise Concerning Religious Affections ( 1746), had taught that true knowledge of another's soul cannot be had by observing mere outward appearances: "[T]he Scripture plainly intimates that this way of judging what is in men by outward ap- pearances, is at best uncertain and liable to deceit; 'The Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart' (1 Samuel 16:7)."-53 In contrast to this scriptural view, the scientific epistemol- ogy adopted by Bain and others gave priority to external observable correlates of 49 Bain, Emotions (1865) (cit. n. 20), p. 3.

Another feature of this new approach to the body as part of the study of the mind was the view that the body was active, rather than the passive vehicle or instrument of an active soul (the most common view among Christian writers). So in the case of emotions it was the spontaneous activity of the central nervous system that caused passive mental feelings. Bain, for example, in accounting for emotions, referred to the "action of the viscera" and "the action of the cerebrum upon involuntary mus- cles."'54 If monism had been strictly adhered to, the activity of the central nervous system would have been assumed to have a mental side too, and so mind would be just as active as body. However professions of monism were often mixed up with opposition to Christian dualism and its associated spiritualist psychology, so that the monist claim that there were two sides to each emotion could get transformed into the more physicalist claim that it was really the body rather than the mind that was active in emotions. This point about the reactive nature of British physiological psychologists' monism is also made by Stephen Jacyna in his essay "The Physiology of Mind, The Unity of Nature, and The Moral Order in Victorian Thought": "This monism was developed in opposition to a contrary world view which insisted on both the autonomy of the soul and on the transcendence and power of God."55 Man-Animal Continuism Bain, Spencer, and Darwin were all alienated from the Christian religion in general for a complex mixture of personal, intellectual, professional, and social reasons. When it came to their treatments of the emotions, in particular, they shared an oppo- sition to the design theology methodology of the Scottish natural theologian and anatomist Sir Charles Bell (1774-1842). Bell had become famous for his discovery of the distinction between afferent (sensory) and efferent (motor) nerves and had produced a Bridgewater Treatise on the wonderful contrivance of the human hand. Bell's book on expression was the single most influential book on the physiological and expressive side of the passions and emotions prior to the 1 850s. Bain, Spencer, and Darwin all read the 1844 third edition of Bell's Anatomy and Philosophy of Expression, which contained detailed descriptions of the nerves and muscles in- volved in the expression of passions and emotions, with a particular focus on the respiratory system.56 Bain and Darwin both also incorporated examples from Bell's book in their own work. However, they, along with Spencer, placed these facts about the nervous system within a new psychological framework where physiological and evolutionary explanations were sought in preference to Bell's natural theological ones. The physiological and evolutionary schools shared an ontological commitment to the continuity of human beings with the rest of the animal kingdom, which was the 54 Bain, Emotions (1865) (cit. n. 20), p. 10. 55 See, e.g., Bain, Mind and Body (cit. n. 48), chaps. 4 and 6; Jacyna, "Physiology of Mind" (cit. n.2),p. 119. 56Autobiography, p. 229; Spencer, Principles (cit. n. 43), vol. 2, p. 557; Charles Darwin, The Ex- pression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (London: Murray, 1872), pp. 2-3, 9-11, and The Auto- biography of Charles Darwin, ed.

The division between man and the "brute creation" had always been central to Christian psychology. This division is set out at the beginning of the Bible and is at the root of Christian thought about passions (shared to some degree with lower animals) and affections and sentiments (along with reason, hallmarks of human uniqueness).57 Its rejection was a prime example of how opposition to a Christian ontology could shape psychological theorizing. This commitment to sameness of ontology (humans and other animals are the same sort of being) was expressed also in the commitment to sameness of epistemol- ogy, whether approaching humans or animals. While Bell had sought to illuminate all that was distinctive about human physiology and physiognomy and all that ele- vated spiritual human beings above the level of mere animal passion, Spencer and Darwin, to support the evolutionary hypothesis, sought evidence that pointed to the close relation of Homo sapiens to other animals. They both compared laughter in humans and monkeys to argue for a common progenitor.58 This was particularly significant, since laughter had been one of the forms of expression, along with weep- ing, picked out by Bell as being "peculiarly human, arising from sentiments not participated by the brutes."' Spencer and Darwin both explicitly presented their evolutionary accounts of emo- tional behaviors as superior alternatives to the natural theological account favored by Bell (that these expressions were divinely designed communicative mechanisms). Darwin in particular had attacked Bell for his appeal to the belief that each species had been separately and independently created: "By this doctrine, anything and ev- erything can be equally well explained; and it has proved as pernicious with respect to Expression as to every other branch of natural history." 61 Alan Fridlund has argued that Darwin's Expression is surprisingly un-Darwinian: in it Darwin relied exclu- sively on explanations in terms of inheritance of acquired characteristics (in this case, habits) rather than on explanations in terms of natural selection, in particular, Darwin did not argue that most emotional expressions had been inherited because they were useful. The reason for this was, indirectly, Darwin's opposition to natural theology. Bell had argued that the communicative functions of our expressions were divinely contrived; God had made special arrangements of nerves and muscles to allow human beings to communicate their feelings to one another.6' One of the prin- cipal ways in which Darwin attacked this natural theological theory was to deny that expressions had an expressive function, or indeed any useful function. Instead he largely sought to explain them as habits that were originally useful but that, in suc- cessive generations, as environmental conditions changed, had ceased to be useful. If expressions of emotions did not have a useful function, then they could not survive preferentially as a result of natural selection. All that was left, then, was a use- inheritance account of the evolution of expressive behaviors. Thus opposition to 57 See, e.g., Gen. 1.26; Saint Augustine, Confessions XIII.32, De trinitate XII. 13; Robert J.

This was precisely what Thomas Baynes (1823- 1887), an advocate of Bell's natural theology, argued in his 1873 Edinburgh Review article on Darwin's Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. In a letter to Bain, Darwin called the review "magnificently contemptuous."63 In particular it crit- icized Darwin for artificially decreasing the distinction between animals and humans by reading emotion into the slightest of animal movements-"[T]he extent to which Mr Darwin persistently reads his own theory into the ambiguous muscular twitches and spasms of monkeys and other animals is often amusing in a high degree"; indeed Darwin had described the expressions and attitudes of affectionate cats, humble dogs, impatient horses, irritated bulls, enraged deer, and grieving, jealous, or de- pressed monkeys.64 Figure 3 reproduces two illustrations from Darwin's Expression, complete with their rather anthropomorphic captions. Baynes further criticized Darwin for concentrating only on man's lower passions and animal desires-"The manner in which he continually degrades and vulgarises human emotion is equally striking."65 In short, "There is an obvious effort from the first to bring vividly into view not what is most distinctive in the expression of human emotion, but what is common to men and animals."66 It was true that Darwin assumed, for example, that observations of animals were the "safest basis for gener- alisations on the causes, or origin, of the various movements of expression.?67 Con- sequently he tended to present the generalizations that could be made about behav- iors shared by human and nonhuman animals as the only generalizations that could be made about the expression of emotions in humans. Baynes put it like this: "[F]rom the sources to which Mr Darwin exclusively refers for his facts, it is impos- sible to obtain illustrations of the higher and more characteristic human emotions.?68 Darwin had also stated that he considered the most useful indication of a good mode of explanation to be that it could be "applied with satisfactory results, both to man and to the lower animals."69 His deliberate neglect of explanations that could not equally be applied to human and to nonhuman animals rendered his conclusion- that the expression of the emotions is very similar in human beings and in other animals-rather a foregone and circular one. This is evidence of how one sort of evolutionary worldview could include a com- mitment to the basic ontological sameness of human and nonhuman animals, which 62 See Alan Fridlund, "Darwin's Anti-Darwinism in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals," in International Review of Studies on Emotion, 2 vols., ed.

This methodology deter- mined the examples used and the results obtained, which results confirmed the origi- nal premise that, in Darwin's own words, "[T]here is no fundamental difference between man and the higher animals in their mental faculties."7" A priori metaphysi- cal commitments could play a role in shaping theory for the nonreligious as much as for the religious psychologist. Personal and Social Factors Having examined some prima fticie evidence of the consonance between a worldview comprising certain anti-Christian (as well as some nonreligious) commit- ments on the one hand, and physiological and evolutionary theories of emotions on the other, we can now turn to a different sort of evidence. Biographical information about Bain's relationship with Christianity and the churches will serve here as a particularly useful example of how personal and social factors can influence a per- son's worldview, which in turn can determine the lexical and conceptual resources and methods applied in an inquiry into the human mind. In the case of Bain, his autobiography is a good source of relevant evidence external to his psychological theories of his religious and metaphysical commitments. Bain was born and raised in Aberdeenshire, the son of a harsh Calvinistic father. From an early age, he recalled in his Autobiography, he would peruse his father's collection of books, almost all of which were tracts of popular Calvinist theology. One book that interested him was The Hieroglyphic Bible, which consisted of bibli- cal narratives in which some of the words were replaced by pictures. "Of these last, the most notable was a figure of God as a naked old man in sitting posture I sup- pose suggested by some design of a pagan deity, or, more likely by the 'Ancient of Days' of Daniel. This figure has haunted me ever since when the name of God is pronounced, if I do not forcibly exclude it from consciousness."7' Along with this troubling and anthropomorphic image of God, Bain was subjected throughout his childhood to grisly sermons from his father at the Sunday breakfast table on the theme of hell and damnation, to which he and his family, he was told, were irredeemn- ably destined.72 During his adolescence he never experienced the conversion mo- ment that was crucial to the Calvinist Presbyterianism of his father and so never joined Church communion. B Once at Marischal College in Aberdeen, Bain began, with a group of friends, to read Auguste Comte's Cours de philosophlie positive (pub- lished in instalments between 1830 and 1842), which John Stuart Mill had recom- mended to him as, despite certain errors, "very nearly the grandest work of this age."74 He attributed the final demise of his precarious religious beliefs to these studies of Comnte and the acceptance of the threefold scheme of history in which theological modes of thought were displaced first by metaphysical and finally by I" Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man. and Selection in Relation to Sex. 2nd ed.

Bain, like Brown, was neither a minister of the church nor even religiously orthodox. As a result, there was often resistance to his applications for academic posts. Time and again he lost out to ortho- dox Christian rivals in competitions for academic positions, because he was "obnox- ious to the Church party."77 In the 1840s and 1850s Bain applied unsuccessfully for the chair of natural philosophy at Aberdeen, the chair of moral philosophy at Aber- deen, and the chair of philosophy at Queen's College, Belfast.78 This last post went to the Free Church minister James McCosh, whose work on emotions is considered later in this essay. McCosh was again Bain's rival when he applied for the chair of logic in Aberdeen in 1860. Bain recounted the incident in his Autobiography: "No sooner was my application generally known, than a powerful agitation was com- menced in favour of my chief rival, Professor McCosh of Belfast. He had the whole support of the Free Church of Scotland, and the sympathies of the greater number of the Established Church members as well."79 Those professors at Aberdeen Uni- versity who opposed Bain's appointment urged their colleagues not to "tamely sit and see an infidel appointed to a Chair." It was only through the intervention of the Home Secretary (whose friend George Grote was also a friend of Bain's) that Bain was appointed to the chair. It is hardly surprising to learn that, after these decades of struggling to gain academic posts in the face of church opposition, Bain was prone, in private conversation at least, to launch the occasional "antiChristian on- slaught," as his friend, the positivist writer G. H. Lewes (I1817-1878) described it on one occasion in 1 866.8() Here again geographical factors played a role. It is notable that Bain was the "Lon- don" candidate for the Aberdeen chair. His allegiance to positivism and physiolog- ical psychology arose from his extended visits to London from 1841 onward and his residence there from 1856 to 1859 (while he was writing the first edition of the Emotions).8' In the English-speaking world, London, rather than Scotland or Oxford or Cambridge, was the center for the rise of physiological psychology arid of pos- itivism in the 1840s and 1850s.82 The physicalist appropriation of the Brownian 75Autobiography, pp. 153-9.

Bain's Scottish education (especially the influence of Brown via Chalmers), when combined with his association with John Stuart Mill, the positiv- ists, and the physiological psychologists of London, produced in his work a theory of emotions that was Scottish by birth but that owed much to the intellectual environ- ment of London for its later development.8-3 In two instances (Belfast in 1851 and Aberdeen in 1860) Bain's rival and opponent was James McCosh. McCosh, like Bain, wrote on the emotions: McCosh's approach to the emotions was a mixture of Calvinist theology, common sense philosophy, and scientific psychology. His insistence on an active and cognitive view will be exam- ined shortly. For the present it should be noticed that there was a conflict between Bain and McCosh at the level of psychological theory, which was correlated with personal, social, and professional oppositions between the two derived from Church membership or nonmembership. My suggested interpretation of this evidence is that these social and professional factors were responsible for influencing the worldview inhabited by each, and thus the lexical and conceptual resources consequently fa- vored in the construction of their inquiries into the human mind. The "Darwinian Sect" One way of interpreting the adoption by thinkers such as Brown and Bain of world- view commitments derived from science would be to say that science had become, for them, an alternative religion. This is just the interpretation that was offered by Thomas Baynes. In his review of Darwin, discussed earlier, Baynes extended the accusation of a priorism that he leveled initially at Darwin also to Bain, Thomas Huxley, and the psychiatrist Henry Maudsley; all of these were considered to be members of the "Darwinian sect."'4 Baynes saw these thinkers as sharing with other religious sects an element of "strong but unenlightened" belief. The external evi- dence of the evolution of humans from monkeys was notoriously deficient, he said, but "The cavils of the sceptics are of no avail with the true evolutionist believer, because he has an unfaltering trust in his own sacred books and inspired writers.... His [Huxley's] whole temper and spirit is essentially dogmatic of the Presbyterian or Independent type, and he might fairly be described as a Roundhead who had lost his faith."85 Baynes' judgment could be rephrased as the claim that the approach to psychology of the physiologists and evolutionists was not determined only by facts and evidence but also by their prior metaphysical commitments, which determined what could be assumed to exist, what was a valid way to investigate it, and how it in Metaphors in the History of Psychology. ed.

Such worldview commitments were the results of personal, social, and professional factors more than empirical ones. It is particularly interesting that Baynes suggested that these scientific- evolutionary commitments were quasi-religious in their function.86 It was true that scientific practice and theory could provide thinkers such as Bain, Spencer, and Dar- win with ontological, epistemological, and narrative resources that could usurp roles previously fulfilled, for them and others, by religious commitments. In addition, the fact that these thinkers, in their psychological texts, explicitly disavowed soul-body dualism, the separation between humans and animals, and design theology is evi- dence in favor of the claim that their worldview contained certain antireligious as- sumptions as well as more purely metaphysical ones. The Preacher-Psychologists: James McCosh (1811-1894) and George Ti Ladd (1842-1921) Traveling across the Atlantic to New England, we find that psychological theorizing could be based on yet another set of religious and scientific commitments. In America there was still room in the nascent profession of psychology for thinkers who could be described as "natural theologians" or "preacher-psychologists": indi- viduals engaged with both religious and nonreligious psychological resources. These Christian writers maintained commitments to soul-body dualism, the priority of the mental in emotions, and consequently to the introspective method in psychol- ogy. The resulting theories of emotions tended to be cognitive and antireductionist. Two figures will serve as examples here: James McCosh and George Trumbull Ladd. James McCosh's 1880 book, The Emnotions, was one of the most substantial, as well as one of the last books of psychology that was both significantly informed by Christian belief and also written as a contribution to the new academic psychology. McCosh, the historian of the Scottish philosophy, made his name as one of the group (led by Chalmers) that left the established Church there and set up the Free Church of Scotland in 1843. His first book, The Method of Divine Government, Physical and Moral (1850), established him as a major theologian and philosopher. It sold well in Britain and America to academic and nonacademic readers alike. As a result of this success, he was appointed to the chair of logic and metaphysics at Queen's College, Belfast (in preference to the infidel Bain). In 1868 he traveled across the Atlantic to take up his position as the new president of the College of New Jersey in Princeton. While at Princeton in the 1 870s he was one of the only Christian minis- ters to speak in favor of the doctrine of evolution and its compatibility with belief in God (Figure 4).W7 George T.

Ladd's treatment of emotions and sentiments comes in his second major text, Psycholg(gy, Descriptive and Explanatory (1894). The historian of psychology A. A. Roback has characterized Ladd and McCosh as "the last of the Church Mohicans." He calls Ladd a "pre-scientific ... preacher- psychologist." It is true that Ladd had been a Christian minister and preacher for ten years before turning to academic philosophy and thence psychology. He published a book entitled The Doctrine o/'Sacred Scripture (I1883) and, later, The Philosophy of Religion (1905). Roback gives the following dismissive summary of Ladd's work: "To Ladd, psychology was not a natural science. Ladd was still the soul psycholo- gist, or if we wish to be gracious, we might say he was a personalist."90 Mind-BodV. Dualismn Almost all the treatments of passions, affections, and emotions produced by nineteenth-century Christian writers were explicitly opposed to "materialism" and were predicated on mind-body dualism. For example, Bell, in dealing with weep- ing and laughter, described them, not only as arising from sentiments not shared by the brutes but also as arising from "mental conditions, independent of physical causes.'" The mind or soul was conceived as a substance inhabiting or using a body. Martyn Paine (I1794-1877) a professor in the medical department of the Univer- sity of New York, and a devout Episcopalian taught that the soul was a self-acting substance, 'subserved" by the brain and the nervous system.9' The body was often described as the "tenement ( or -instrument" of the soul.93 William Lyall expressed this central commitment in a typical way: "The most essential part of our nature is unquestionably the living soul within us the spiritual substance of which we are possessed, or which is clothed in a material body, united to a material organiza- tion.""4 The American theistic philosopher and psychologist Laurens Hickok (I1798- 1888) taught that "'t]he psychology we attain must recognize through all its facts, the existence of a rational spirit, which dwells in a tabernacle of flesh and blood."95 As a result of this mind-body dualism it was clear for the Christian and theistic psychologists while it was increasingly unclear in the works of monist psycholo- gists that the "emotion in the mind" and the "exertion of the bodily frame"96 were different things, the former causing the latter. As McCosh put it, in opposing the monist school associated with Bain and Spencer! 'There is no propriety in calling the nervous affection a correlate of the emotion, or representing the two, after the fa- shion of the school, as the sides of one thing.

This became particularly clear in theories of emotions. McCosh, for example. insisted that all emotions were psychical acts," which produced only secondarily "physiological concomitants and effects."9 The bodily element was, on McCosh's view, temporally last and also last in importance in the process of any emotional experience: "Emotion is not what has often been presented by physiologists, a mere nervous reaction from a bodily stimu- lus, like a kick which the frog gives when it is pricked. It begins with a mental act, and throughout is essentially an operation of the mind." ')() He opposed reductionist forms of physiological psychology, criticizing "the tendency on the part of the pre- vailing physiological psychology of the day to resolve all feeling, and our very emo- tions, into nervous action, and thus gain an important province of our nature to mate- rialism."rll There was an evident continuity between McCosh's writing and the Calvinist teaching of Jonathan Edwards on the religious affections a century and a half before. Edwards had insisted, like McCosh, that As 'tis the soul only that has ideas, so 'tis the soul only that is pleased or displeased with its ideas. As 'tis the soul only that thinks, so 'tis the soul only loves or hates, rejoices or is grieved at what it thinks of. Nor are these motions of the animal spirits, and fluids of the body, anything properly belonging to the nature of the affections; though they always accompany them, in the present state; but are only effects or con- comitants of the affections, that are entirely distinct from the affections themselves, and no way essential to them: so that an unbodied spirit may be as capable of love and hatred. joy or sorrow. hope or fear, or other affections, as one that is united to a body.'02 The tendency to give priority to the mental (and especially the cognitive) over the physiological was as characteristic of Christian writers on emotions in the nineteenth century as it had been of Christian writers on affections in the eighteenth. Cognitiv e Theor-ies ot Enotion The cognitive Christian approach to emotions differed from the "infidel" psycholo- gists' views in two ways. First. on the cognitive view, passions, affections, or emo- tions were seen as acts of the soul rather than passive products of an active body. Second, they were seen as intimately connected with the rational soul (products of intellectual activity) rather than feelings to be contrasted with intellectual states of mind (as was the case for Brown and Bain). Of the "psychical" elements of emotion, to which McCosh gave priority in his 9 McCosh, Emotionis (cit. n. 20), p. 108. 9 Hoeveler. McCosh (cit. n. 87). pp. 102-3. " McCosh.

His Physiology of the Soul and Instinct as Distinguished from Materialism (1872) provided facts about the ways that nerves, viscera, and muscles were involved in expressing passions and emotions, while demoting these organs to secondary sta- tus as the instruments upon which the immaterial soul acted.104 He, like McCosh, was influenced by eighteenth-century Christian thought and displayed the same commitment to the priority of the mental and cognitive: When speaking of the passions and mental emotions as elements of the mind, and as producing involuntary effects, I desire to be critically understood that it is not intended to be implied that they are not more or less associated with acts of intellection, and perhaps always, brought into operation by some act of the mind properly so called [i.e., reason]."5 Paine, writing in 1872, spoke primarily the Christian language of the "Will" and its "'passions."''06 He used the term "emotion" relatively sparingly and secondarily. 107 It is particularly striking that Paine, in his Physiology of the Soul, revealed his indebt- edness to eighteenth-century Christian thought on the passions and affections by quot- ing from Isaac Watts (1 674-1748)108 and by using the analogy of watch and watch- maker-used by Joseph Butler and William Paley (1743-1805), among many others-in his discussion of the contrivance by the Creator of the mechanism of the human mind. '09 These authorities and images were not current among non-Christian emotions theorists. Ladd's theory of emotions also had all the hallmarks of the theories of a Christian writer: it concentrated on the intellectual elements in emotion-"the dependence of the higher emotions and sentiments on the intellectual processes of memory, imagi- nation and thinking is obvious and immediate"'10; it also distinguished between higher, "ideal" "sentiments" and lower "emotions and passions." Ladd's psycholog- ical terminology was a hybrid between traditional Christian and more recent "scien- tific" systems; he tended to use "emotions" where the traditional term would have been "passions," and "sentiments" where Edwards and others would have used "af- fections": In general, great intensity and consequent strong 'bodily resonance' are characteristics of the emotions and passions. A much lower intensity, and a far larger admixture of influence from ideal considerations, are characteristic of the sentiments.... In applying the word 'ideal' to the sentiments we should understand that these affective phenomena are the farthest possible distant from such relatively simple and content-less feelings as "Il McCosh, Emotions (cit. n. 20), p. 42. 114 Paine, Physiology (cit. n. 92), especially pp. 33-43. 1"5 Ibid., p. 57. 1()6 Ibid., pp. 28, 30. 33, 40-1, 43. 55, 58, 60, 62.

But by calling the sentiments 'spiritual' forms of feeling, we mean to emphasise in a positive way the very thing which we emphasise negatively when we say that they are not, like the emotions, obviously built upon a basis of somatic reactions. They are, of all our affective phenomena, most obvi- ously ascribed purely to a highly generalised and abstract conception of the Ego, con- sidered as freed from all dependence on the bodily organism.111 Ladd appears not to have been familiar with the traditional distinction between pas- sions and affections and seems, rather, to have reinvented it in his distinction be- tween "emotions and passions" and "sentiments." His "sentiments," like Augustine's and Edwards' "affections," were full of ideas and reason and hence marked human beings out as superior to the lower animals and as "spiritual" creatures. Compound and Component Approaches It also tended to be the Christian psychologists who favored compound or compo- nent (as opposed to aggregate) views of emotions, such as McCosh's, in which the emotion was an irreducible and qualitatively novel mental experience (rather than just an aggregate of sensations, as it was for Bain and Spencer) resulting from the combination of several elements. On McCosh's theory, emotions had four elements: the "appetence," or basic inclination to avoid pain and seek pleasure; the idea, or "phantasm"; the conscious feeling of excitement; and finally the organic (bodily) affection. As we have seen, he was quite clear that the idea was essential, and that the bodily affection was only a secondary element."2 Ladd also viewed emotions as compounds with various components or, as he called them, "variables." Ladd's four variables were "primitive feeling," "bodily resonance,; "ideation and thought," and fourth, in the more complex emotions, primary emotions.'3 In the cases of these preacher-psychologists, who were teaching in American uni- versities in the 1 870s and 1 880s, we have ample evidence both internal and external to their psychological texts of their religious commitments, the most notable being, in the cases of McCosh and Ladd, their publication of theological treatises and ordi- nation into the Christian church. There is also no doubt that they were, even by their own account, seeking to write scientific psychology. This makes them particularly revealing cases. They frequently contrasted their own approaches with "material- ism," which, as we have noted, was almost a synonym for atheism in the literature of the period, thus deliberately directing their readers' minds toward moral and reli- gious concerns. Their construction of psychological theories that preserved distinc- tions between human beings and animals, between soul and body, which gave prior- ity to the former, which privileged introspection, and which chose examples that favored a cognitive and antireductionist view of emotions and sentiments are all further evidence of how their psychological theories were harmonized and corre- lated with their religious worldview commitments.

The evidence I have marshaled here, in the case of nineteenth-century emotions theories, is no exception. It certainly does not reach the highest possible evidential level, at which many sources, including the writings of the author in question, would explicitly affirm the theory-shaping role that reli- gious or antireligious beliefs had played (though even this might not constitute con- clusive evidence). Where, then, can we position the evidence produced here, on the hierarchy of evidential levels I set up at the outset? In the central cases of Brown, Bain, McCosh, and Ladd, the evidence certainly goes beyond mere prima facie compatibility between prior worldview commitments and psychological theories (level 1). The religious or antireligious views that these authors actually held were established using evidence external to their psychological texts (level 2). Additional evidence was then found in statements made by the au- thors and their contemporaries about the links between their religious or antireli- gious views and their psychological theory (level 3). Most of this evidence took the form of statements simply noting compatibilities between religious and psychologi- cal views rather than suggesting causal connections. Finally, a small number of state- ments by psychologists and their contemporaries went further and suggested that religious views had played a causal role in shaping psychological theories (level 4). The claims made by some of Brown's and Bain's critics that their psychological systems were shaped by atheistic presuppositions is an example of weaker evidence of this sort, while the connection made by both Darwin and Spencer between their disbelief in a designing God and their choice of theoretical account of the emotions is an example of stronger evidence of this sort. Although this evidence is admittedly partial and imperfect, certain general trends in theories of passions and emotions can still be discerned that seem to have been correlated with the religious, nonreligious, or antireligious views of their authors. In theories of emotions produced by writers committed to an atheological worldview, theological agents such as the will, the soul, God, the Holy Spirit, the passions, and the affections were displaced. The ontology of the psychology of emotions devel- oped by Bain, Spencer, and Darwin in the 1 850s-l 870s was one in which there were only two real psychical agencies: the evolutionary past and the body (especially the nerves). Introspection on one's own soul was replaced by observation of others' bod- ies and behaviors as the favored epistemology. Moral theological and salvation- historical stories about people as God's creatures who had sinned and fallen but could be saved were replaced with natural historical ones about human organ- isms as evolved animals whose emotions were products of their ancestors' environ- ments. For Christians and theists, in contrast, agency was still ascribed to God and the immaterial soul, especially the will, whose freedom and agency the "infidel" psy- chologists denied; introspection was still favored as an essential epistemological tool; and theories maintaining the distinction between soul and body and in which emotions were irreducible cognitive acts of the former were favored over accounts that privileged evolutionary and physiological considerations. Thus rejections or en-</page><page sequence="33">320 THOMAS DIXON dorsements of Christian beliefs seem to have been strongly correlated with alterna- tive approaches to theorizing about the "emotions" in the nineteenth century. However, we should remember that these correlations can be interpreted in a num- ber of different ways. It could be suggested that religious or antireligious commit- ments had directly shaped theory construction, but alternatively it might be claimed that these commitments simply played the selective role of helping thinkers choose between existing theories, or that religious attitudes were only secondary by- products of or glosses on psychological theorizing, or even that they were largely independent of it. As was noted at the outset, the causal explanatory story is not the only one that can be told about such correlations. To return, finally, to Psychosis in 1884: his judgment was that "nine-tenths of the Christian world" perceived connections between psychology and religious beliefs. And, indeed, a considerable amount of evidence can be found of such connections- both in general correlations between worldviews and theories and, here and there, in more direct links. However, it is difficult to go much farther. The complexity and contingency of the past realities and of the historical evidence virtually guarantee the failure of any attempt to establish more generalizable causal connections between a rejection or endorsement of certain religious beliefs on the one hand and the detailed content of psychological theories of emotions on the other.</page></plain_text>
