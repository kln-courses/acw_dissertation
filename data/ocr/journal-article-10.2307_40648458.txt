Enacting Death and Politics in Mexico Sarah M.Misemer Texas A&amp;M University Abstract: Garro's one-act play offers an unusual combination of corpses and animate actors on stage thus combining life and death in the same body. Garro's piece presents students with an approach to "embodying" Mexican culture and its notions of death. The fusion of death and cultural practices in Mexico is a crucial part of the ongoing project for constructing an ideal nation in Garro's play, a project born out of the periods of Independence and Revolution. The family crypt in Un hogar sólido - a house for the dead - becomes an allegorical site of residence for the Mexican national family which yearns for a solid and unified home. Through performance, students "inhabit" this house for the dead in ways not accessible through reading alone. Drama helps students to get inside the consciousness of other human beings and experience a critical segment of life. Thus, performances of Un hogar sólido paradoxically provide student-actors insight into Mexican conceptions of death through live stagings. Key Words: death totems, dia de los muertos, Garro (Elena), mestizaje, Mexican concepts of death, Mexican culture, Mexican Revolution, Salinas de Gortari presidency, Un hogar sólido like Cathy Larson, Robert K. Anderson, Patricia Rosas Lopátegui and Vicky Unruh among others have pointed out the remarkable spatial and temporal dimensions of Elena Garro ' s one-act play Un hogar sólido ( 1 95 7), a play which forms part of a series of several short plays grouped in an anthology under the same title. What has not yet been studied, however, is the importance of the body in this piece as dead characters in a family crypt are fleshed out by live actors. Garro's piece offers an unusual combination of corpses and animate actors on stage thus combining life and death in the same body. When students stage this play as they do in my introduction-to-literature class, Garro's piece presents students with an ap- proach to "embodying" Mexican culture and its notions of death. I will argue that the fusion of death and cultural practices in Mexico is a crucial part of the on-going project for constructing an ideal nation in Garro's play: a project born out of the periods of Independence and Revolution. In this way, Garro ' s family crypt in Un hogar sólido - "a house for the dead" to borrow Ann Warren Turner' s phrase - becomes an allegorical site of residence for the Mexican national family which yearns for a solid and unified home.1 Through performance, students inhabit this house for the dead in ways not accessible through reading alone.2 Ciar Doyle supports this view in Raising Curtains on Education: Drama as a Site for Critical Pedagogy (1993): "Literature helps the reader to experience events, situations, and emotions vicariously; drama helps a student get inside the consciousness of other human beings and to experience a critical segment of life" (54). Thus, performances of Un hogar sólido paradoxically provide student-actors insight into Mexican conceptions of death through live stagings. By enacting Garro's play, students have the unique opportunity to straddle the divide between the corporeal and the corpse, thus bringing the dead to life. In this play, the actors cross a line which is often blurred in Mexican popular culture, beliefs, and art. Because Mexican culture is so closely tied to death, as evidenced in theoretical works like Claudio Lomnitz's recent book Misemer, Sarah M. "Pedagogía de la Participación: Entering Elena Garro's Un hogar sólido through the Body. Enacting Death and Politics in Mexico" Hispania 92 A (2009): 762-773</page><page sequence="2">Pedagogía de la Participación 763 Death and the Idea of Mexico (2005), cultural practices Xiks El Día de los Muertos, the veneration of the cult of la Santa Muerta by narcotraficantes among others, and even the Museum of Death in Aguascalientes (which opened in 2007), the duality of death as a parallel reality to life is always present for many Mexicans.3 As Joseph Roach suggests in Cities of the Dead: Circum-Atlantic Performance (1996), these actors have the opportunity to "body forth" the dead, offering them not one, but multiple "lives" on stage (36). Some of death's many theatrical lives crop up through national discourses on politics and religion as the characters search for a solid home in Garro' s drama. Death Totems and National Discourses The need to construct a stalwart fortress against the growing tide of violence has become a matter of grave importance of late in Mexico because of the rising death toll along the border, as well as inside the nation. More and more it seems that during the period of the 1990s to the present, bodies have been turning up everywhere: drug mules, newspaper columnists, illegal aliens, gang-bangers riddled with bullets from warring drug factions and/or the Mexican police and/or the Border Patrol, police officers, hundreds of young dead women in the desert, and even the occasional political figure related to the graft and corruption of the Salinas de Gortari presidency represent many of the contemporary bodies that lie in the Mexican house for the dead. In this way, Garro's 1 957 work resists the anachronistic pull of time. The entombed bodies on the stage are reminders of the many bodies that litter the modern nation's landscape. However, these various bodies also recall the ways in which the Mexican national past "bleeds through" like a ghost, in much the same manner as Marvin Carlson theorizes the past, infiltrates and haunts the stage (133). Garro's play brings to the fore the enduring imagery of death in the Mexico's discourse of nation.4 At first glance, it is a curious national marker as Lomnitz suggests. Whereas most nations choose "totems" associated with vitality, growth, and power, Mexico has chosen one linked with decline and decay. Lomnitz defines a totem as "tutelary signs that represented the group as a whole" (73), and argues that "[d]eath emerged as national totem in the aftermath of the Mexican Revolution" (43). The bloody and violent battle for change in the nation was seared into collective memory as the nation repudiated the practices of Porfirio Díaz. Its persistence as a national symbol is the result of the work of revolutionary intellectuals and artists in the 1 920s which envisioned and embraced death in new ways as "anti- thetical to the violence of colonialism, imperialism, and capitalist exploitation" (Lomnitz 43) - subjects which were linked to the porfiriato years and Mexico's broader history. Death was instrumental in bridging the colonial gap between new cultural practices such as Catholicism and former traditions inherited from the Aztec civilization. Through death these two disparate behaviors and ideologies merged, as evidenced in the Days of the Dead celebrations, which combined the European observance of All Saints' and All Souls' Days with the month- long Aztec festivals to honor dead children and adults (Lomnitz 45). As a result, in the political, religious, and socio-cultural realms, death invokes the ongoing syncretic nature of the fight to integrate all segments of the Mexican population - a goal of the Revolution. Artistic figures such as Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and Guadalupe Posada among others used the trope of death to make social and political commentary through their art, at times offering a site for reconciliation and at others, demonstrating the "permanent struggle in which contraries co-exist" (Lomnitz 50). In this way, death "[b]ecame both a paradigmatic image of mestizaje as an aesthetic project and a formulation of the guiding parameters of a political system characterized by overt class struggle and effective state mediation, a system founded on the dialectics of rape, that is, on the fertile and reproductive consequences of violent exploitation" (52). Therefore, Mexico's death totem represents much more than just decay. It is a symbol of the vibrant juxtaposition and ongoing tussle between classes and ideologies that was brought to bear in the Mexican Revo- lution, seen in the uprisings in Chiapas, felt in the fall of the PRI dynasty and the PAN presidency of Vicente Fox, and evidenced in the recent political controversies surrounding the election of</page><page sequence="3">764 Hispania 92 December 2009 Felipe Calderón in 2006.5 Paradoxically, death is very much alive in Mexico. Whimsical Couples: Death and hogares mexicanos Elements of this rhetoric of death/struggle can be found at every turn in Garro's play. As the scene opens, the public hears the voices of doña Gertrudis and Clemente - a married couple in the crypt - discussing footsteps. Clemente scoffs at Gertrudis, claiming she is imagining it: "¡Tú siempre estás oyendo pasos! ¿Por qué serán tan impacientes las mujeres? ¡Siempre anticipán- dose a lo que no va a suceder, vaticinando calamidades" (13). To which she replies "[p]ues los oigo," provoking Clemente to rebuff her: "[n]o mujer, siempre te equivocas, te dejas llevar por tu nostalgia de catástrofes" (14). Not only do the characters begin the play with an argument heard in these initial lines, but they also invoke the discourse of "calamities" and "catastrophes" which has become a familiar and integral part of the contemporary Mexican national rhetoric.6 Lomnitz further explains that "[r]ather than becoming a proud and powerful empire, México was bullied, invaded, occupied, mutilated, and extorted by foreign powers and independent operators alike" (28). As Lomnitz has suggested, intellectuals purposefully adopted fatal symbols like the Aztec sacrifice, Aztec skull rack, the image of "life and death [seen] as a whimsical couple" as a "blue- print" for a new nation in the aftermath of the Revolution's upheaval (43). The nostalgia for disaster and death (after all the footsteps Gertrudis hears bring dead bodies to the crypt) can be seen as longing for an ideal nation within contemporary Mexican discourse - a home which critic Svetlana Boym argues perhaps can exist only through desire, as nostalgia (xiii). Marked by a violent process of mestizaje, as Lomnitz has pointed out, Mexico has been caught between the pull to modernize, adopt the new, embrace that which is foreign, and evolve, while concomitantly holding steadfastly to it roots and resisting invasion. Garro highlights this prickly dialect of desire and fulfillment in the perspectives of each of the characters she introduces. On the one hand, Clemente mocks death and dismisses it as the naïve imagination of Gertrudis. In his eyes, her insistence on death's constant presence is overwrought superstition; he repudiates the possibility for an ideal national home. However, through Gertrudis the public sees that, at least in this instance, she is right, and that death is literally upon them as one more member of the family is about to be buried in the crypt. Through Gertrudis' s insistence on looming death, ironically the hope for a new hearth is kept alive. As the funeral pro- cession alights atop the crypt, the characters hear the voice of one of its speakers: "[l]a generosa tierra de nuestro México abre sus brazos para darte amoroso cobijo" (24). As Gertrudis has foretold, the calamity of death is certain, and here, Garro fuses it with the Mexican territory. The generous land in this instance is clearly made up of the remains of this particular family - the par- cel of earth into which the next kin (Lidia) is deposited is sustained by the disintegrating bones and bodies of its inhabitants. As Larson indicates, "Lidia, like all of the other dead members of her family, will participate in a constantly shifting and repeating cycle that unites her with the universe. In that sense, she will become part of all time, her new existence demonstrating not merely a spatial, but also a temporal union stretching into eternity" (7). As the newly deceased Lidia makes her entrance, Clemente is panicked to find his bones missing and humorously requests help: "[ajyudame a buscar mis metacarpos, siempre los pierdo y sin ellos no puedo dar la mano" (14). The anthropomorphic characteristics that Garro lends Mexico in this piece of dialogue imbue the nation with corporeal dimensions in death. Curiously, it is a cadaver which opens its arms to receive the newest member of the family - a kind of reverse birthing in which the dead enter into the generous motherland. Here, the deceased family's generations co-exist without regard to time's divisive measures. Garro filters her ideal theatrical and national home through the mother country and its dead male's arms (a "whimsical" couple of life and death if ever there were one). In this image the desire for the nation and its fulfillment begin to take shape. The complex yearning for solidity that was born out of the initial rape and subsequent process of mestizaje that Mexico endured throughout the period of (post-) colonization, is made manifest in the subtle political allusions that Garro inserts throughout the play. Garro calls into</page><page sequence="4">Pedagogía de la Participación 765 play the historical backdrop of conflict seen in the Independence and Revolution periods through her allusions to costumes. In the first instance, Vicente Mejia has been buried "en traje de oficial juarista" as the stage directions indicate (14). His clothing references the period of government in which Benito Juárez,7 an indigenous figure, eventually rose to the presidency and instated the liberal reform that was first sought in the Independence period. He did so after the defeat of the French occupying forces and the execution of their leader Maximilian in 1 867. 8 This historical figure invokes both the external Imperial forces of colonization that Mexico has suffered throughout its post-Columbian history, as well as the internal schisms caused by racial difference because of his affiliation with conservative Mexican elites.9 References to Juarez's presidency also call to mind secular-religious debates which have made co-existence arduous among the different constituencies of Mexico. Later, Garro uses dialogue to examine the conflicts that have plagued the nation. Here, Vicente and Catita (Mamá Jesusita' s child, who died at age five) comment on their long interment: Vicente contemplates his open battle wounds while the child Catita cries for her mother. Now able to soothe her child, Mamá Jesusita explains her previous absence from the crypt: "[y]a te he dicho, Catita, nos fuimos a México, luego vino la Revolución" (26). Here, Mamá Jesusita's temporal reference to the Revolution sets up the historical frame for the ensuing conversation among the dead and their newest member. Just after the allusion to the nation's internal war, the characters comment on Eva, described in the play as "an extranjera," and the death of her son, Muni. Eva wears a dress from the 1 920s and explains her long silence toward the entombed family when she was buried: "[tjambién yo estaba cohibida ... y además pensaba en Muni ... y en mi ca- sa ... aquí estaba todo tan callado" (26). From the vintage clothing she wears, the public surmises she has died just after the Revolution, an allusion, perhaps, to the death of porifiriato years in which foreigners were allowed access to the national patrimony - the same years in which the country's artists and intellectuals sought a new image for Mexico through mortuary symbols.10 Here, her preoccupation with the family's home suggests a metaphorical concern for the nation's fate. Eva's disquiet over the family's home will later become her son Muni's obsessive focus. Through her son and the newly-arrived Lidia (the daughter of Clemente and Gertrudis) the humor in the play turns to anguish and the yearning for a safe and prosperous home takes on national proportions. In Anderson's reading: "Muni y Lidia se manifiestan como personajes que han padecido excesivamente de una vida alienada y hostil [...]. Separados de sus familias nu- cleares, al parecer a una edad relativamente temprana, se quedaron privados del hogar alegre y armonioso que tuvieron de niños" (95-96). Lidia reveals that Muni committed suicide by in- gesting poison. Her image of him conflates death and the state in two ways: first, through her mention of the Comisaría, and later through a discussion of the need for a solid home. She remembers him "tirado [. . .] en el patio de la Comisaría, con aquel olor a orines que venía de las losas rotas, y [...] durmiendo en la camilla entre los pies de los gendarmes con [el] pijama arrugado, y [su] cara azul" (27). Through Muni's death, the connection with the nation becomes explicit. The commissary, an extension of the state, is seen as a broken, rancid place of intentional death. Muni's death becomes an outgrowth of the violence and problems that the Mexican Revolution represented. Mexican "Miracles" Like the intellectuals who came after the bloody civil war, Muni and Lidia (members of the post-Revolution generation) express their desire to transcend these complications. Their per- sonal histories become intertwined with Mexican national history as they search for a successful dwelling. Héctor Aguilar Camin and Lorenzo Meyer' s In the Shadow of the Mexican Revolution: Contemporary Mexican History, 1910-1989 (1993), is helpful for understanding the conflicts that persisted. Aguilar Camin and Meyer make the argument that Mexico's image of the Revolu- tion was manipulated by several presidents. Alvaro Obregón saw it as "naked armed rebellion" and later Plutarco Elias Calles envisioned it as the "future," a time in which the ideals of the</page><page sequence="5">766 Hispania 92 December 2009 rebellion would be subsequently fulfilled (Aguilar Camin and Meyer 160). Successive presi- dencies like those of Lázaro Cárdenas and Avila Camacho invoked the Revolution differently. For Cárdenas, the Revolution was conceived as a perpetual struggle with new stages that were both linked to history and seen as continuous opportunities for renovation (Aguilar Camin and Meyer 1 60-6 1 ). Contrastingly, Camacho framed the Revolution as a two-part process; the first of which included the social aspects which had already been achieved, and the second, a new phase to grow a prosperous economy (161). Thus, throughout the decades of the 1940s-1960s, Mexico moved toward a "mixed economy" (161). This "mixed economy" was the result of major conflict between the entrepreneurial state and the domestic bourgeoisie" (161). As Aguilar Camin and Meyer explain, "[e]conomic capitalist growth based on the virtual immobility of a political system with strong authoritarian features resulted in a social structure that was very different from the one envisioned by a revolutionary government committed to social justice" (163). During this period, economic policy was based on the controversial idea that "it was first necessary to create wealth to be able to later distribute it" - an idea that originated with Obregón (164). In this light, Muni and Lidia are seen as the victims of the so-called "Mexican Miracle" of the 1940s-1960s, the very years in which Garro is writing and publishing Un hogar sólido. The conflict that characterized the authoritarian state and the aggressive economic reform of this period is reflected in complaints voiced by both Muni and Lidia, who continue to search for a refuge from the difficulties of life which run the gamut from the material to the emotional. For Muni and Lidia, the new phase of the Revolution, further alienates them from prosperity and stability. As Muni explains, his suicide is the result of his impossible life of misery, running the streets like a dog: "[p]ues yo ya no quería caminar banquetas atroces buscando entre la sangre un hueso, ni ver las esquinas, apoyo de borrachos, meaderos de perros. Yo quería un ciudad alegre, llena de soles y de lunas. Una ciudad sólida, como la casa que tuvimos de niños [...]" (28). Through his connection with the "perro callejero," Muni comments on his disenfranchised state as a "home- less" and poverty-stricken figure. His projection of this outlook onto the city connects these sentiments to the larger municipal and national structures. Feeling the same thing, Lidia reacts emotionally: "¡Un hogar sólido, Muni! Eso mismo quería yo. . .y ya sabes, me llevaron a una casa extraña" (28). Lidia's comment emphasizes the physical dislocation she feels when she is taken from home and left to work in another, but also highlights the economic conditions of the time when foreign investment was once more welcome. As Aguilar Camin and Meyer remind us, "by the 1 960s the Mexican industrial dependence on foreign capital and technology became, as in the Porfiriato, quite evident" (162). United in this foreigner's son and the daughter of an autocthon- ous family (a couple which calls to mind the hybridization of culture and economics of the colonial through the post-Revolutionary eras), is the desire to find a stable domicile in the aftermath of the Revolution. As Garro's play makes clear, this post-Revolution generation is still searching. Magical Threads, Martyrs, and Marias Part of the difficulty stems from political practices as the characters intimate. The funeral speech becomes evidence of the rampant corruption and blind excesses of power that continue to be the country's norm. Mamá Jesusita's inquiries about the identity of the speaker reveal he is don Gregorio de la Huerta y Ramírez Puente, Presidente de la Asociación de Ciegos. While on the one hand the conversation among the dead exposes the passage of time (don Gregorio's contemporary practice of familiar address through his use of "tú" in the funeral speech outrages the older generation of those like Mamá Jesusita), on the other, it demonstrates the very stagnation of the country through the persistence of political figures in the same mold (Clemente exclaims "¡Válgame Dios!, ¿pero todavía anda por allá ese botarate?" [25]). Don Gregorio's words about Lidia emphasize the notion of home (one which she has shown to be unsastisfactory in her conversations with Muni): "[pjérdida cruelísima, cuya ausencia habremos de calibrar con el tiempo, nos dejas para siempre privados de tu arrolladora simpatía; y dejas también, a un hogar</page><page sequence="6">Pedagogía de la Participación 767 cristiano y sólido en la orfandad más terrible. Tiemblan los hogares ante la inexorable parca" (25). Don Gregorio ' s words ring hollow in the context of Lidia' s and Muni ' s conversation, and they are also shown to be hypocritical as the dead family's remarks are heard between the lines. Mamá Jesusita reacts to Clemente' s surprise at don Gregorio' s persistence despite the passage of time, complaining, "[l]o que no sirve, abunda" (25). Confirming this very fact, Lidia explains that he is now "Presidente de la Banca, de los caballeros de Colón, de la Ceguera, de la Bandera, y del Día de la Madre" (25). Inasmuch as the Caballeros de Colón are associated with the Catholic Right, Garro could be suggesting a connection between the PAN's political blindness to the situation of the country via the figure of don Gregorio. As don Gregorio continues the ceremony, Catita inno- cently observes the political repetition among generations: "[s]iempre dice lo mismo don Hilario," to which her mother reminds her, "[n]o es don Hilario, Catita, don Hilario hace la friolera de sesenta y siete años que murió" (25). Although this gossipy passage among family members is humorous, it discloses telling critical commentary about the state of the nation. Like the "hogares" that don Gregorio mentions in his melodramatic discourse, he is merely a substitute for the real thing. The confusion that Cati- ta expresses over whether he is don Hilario or don Gregorio points to the easy interchangeability of figures within power structures which stand merely as false façades for transformation. Don Gregorio' s accumulation of titles also bespeaks a concentration of wealth and power. The organi- zations to which he belongs function as oligarchies; repositories of power intended for only a few. Thus, comically his position of authority at the Association of the Blind is a thinly veiled allusion to his own political "ceguera," as well as that of the other parties. He serves in these positions, but as Mamá Jesusita has made clear, his ineptitud "no sirve." In quite the opposite vein, Lidia strives to be of service. Searching for a sturdy home into which she might escape from her circular hell ("infierno circular") on earth, Lidia has relied on activities like embroidery. Through her stitches, she sought a magical, unbreakable thread in which she might "hace[r] de dos nombres uno" (28). Unlike don Gregorio's version of a home, Lidia' s would not be marked by blindness, but rather by a (re-)conciliation. Her thread would unite "la flor a la luz, la manzana al perfume, la mujer al hombre" and through it she "cosería amorosos párpados que cerrarían los ojos que [la] miran, y esta casa entraría en el orden solar. Cada balcón sería una patria diferente" (29). Dreamy and poetic as her vision is, Lidia becomes depressed because she cannot locate the thread. However, the rest of the family reassures her that she eventually will, as they describe the privileges of the dead. Clemente coaxes her: "¿Lili, no estás contenta? Ahora tu casa es el centro del sol, el corazón de cada estrella, la raíz de todas las hierbas, el punto más sólido de cada piedra" (30). Through death, the other characters divulge the unique opportunities they have to become a part of every object and figure in the universe. For Anderson, this means a symbolic allusion to paradise: "en el contexto religioso tanto la ciudad como la casa se hallan siempre vinculados al eje o centro que conduce al individuo hacia un plano paradisíaco" (99). However, read here in the context of a socio-political commentary on the imagery of death in Mexico, these osmotic experiences of blending the dead with the living (i.e. "A mí lo que más me gusta es ser bombón en la boca de una niña" or "No te afliges cuando tus ojos empiecen a desaparecer, porque entonces serás todos los ojos de los perros mirando pies absurdos") demonstrate a co-existence of the type of "contraries" Lomnitz envisions (Garro 30). This cohabitation is most clearly apparent in the synthesis of religious discourses. While Lidia' s wish to connect the nation through a magical thread conjures traditional Aztec notions of death, the other members of the family reinforce the Catholic tradition of saints and martyrs as they await their day of reckoning.11 Like the Mexican population who combined Catholic and pre-Colombian rituals of death, and the intellectuals of the Modernist movement who appropriated images of death to [re] cast the ideals of the Mexican Revolution in the hybridized light oí mestizaje, so too does Garro mix and match cultural signifiers of death in Un hogar sólido. Whereas Lidia invokes the "orden solar" in her vision, Clemente invites her to a celestial one: "[djespués de haber aprendido a ser todas las cosas, aparecerá la lanza de San Miguel, centro del universo y a su luz surgirán las huestes divinas de los ángeles y entraremos en</page><page sequence="7">768 Hispania 92 December 2009 el orden celestial" (31). Muni goes on to insist that he wants to be the fold in an angel's tunic, Catita hopes to be the index finger of God, Gertrudis desires to be Santa Cecilia's harp music, Vicente fancies the fury of San Gabriel's sword, and Clemente yearns to be a particle in San Pedro's rock. Mamá Jesusita reminds them they will be all of that and more after the Final Judgment. Interestingly, Lidia chimes in with her own version of Catholic imagery which blends the European tradition with the local one. She exclaims "[y] yo los dedos costureros de la Virgen bordando . . . bordando. . ." (32). However, it is not clear whether her allusion to the the Virgen is for the white European Mother Mary or the Virgin of Guadalupe, a syncretic figure of great im- portance in Mexico because of her dark hair and skin. The virgen morena, as the myth goes, appeared to Juan Diego on December 12,1531, and instructed him to build a church on the Hill of Tepeyac (Cultural Holiday). As proof of her appearance, Juan Diego was to collect flowers on top of the rocky hill and present them to the Bishop, an act which would seem impossible given the stony topography and winter month (Cultural Holiday). However, as Juan Diego approached the summit of the hill, he was greeted with a terrain full of flowers, which he collected in his coat and offered to the Bishop, a coat which revealed the image of the Virgin Mary (Cultural Holiday). The Basilica was constructed on the Tepeyac Hill in Mexico City, thus joining and reinforcing the Catholic Tradition of mancinismo through a particularly Mexican iconic figure that more closely resembled the indigenous and mestizo populations of the nation. Thus, Lidia's vision of herself as the Virgin's embroidering fingers implicates not only the Aztec references mentioned earlier, but also the unique synergy of the Catholic tradition with the Mexican population of color. As Lidia unites the "flor a la luz" through embroidery thread, she brings together the light of the heavenly and solar orders with that of the Virgen's flowers. This light is echoed in the reference that Clemente makes to the swathe cut by San Miguel's sword and the Assumption of the angels to Heaven, but also in the light that indicates Lidia's burial in the beginning of the play. Catita mistakenly believes it is either San Miguel's sword or a distant relative: " j [m]ira, Jesusita! ¡Viene alguien! ¿Quién le trae, Jesusita? ¿Doña Difteria o San Miguel?" (21). In reality, the light allows Lidia to enter into the family sepulchre. Through Lidia's entrance into the family tomb, Garro fuses once more the indigenous and European traditions, as well as the nation and the death totem. In the final moments of dialogue, Mamá Jesusita is tormented by the sound of a distant horn, believing it is the trumpet calling the faithful to their Final Judgment. Dressed only in her "camisón" she is ill-prepared to meet her god. However, it is Lidia that reminds her that it is only the horn announcing curfew for the military barracks situated near the cemetery. Mamá Jesusita remarks "¿[a] quién se le ocurre poner un cuartel tan cerca de nosotros? ¿Qué gobierno! ¡Se presta a tantas confusiones!" (33). The notes of the trumpet signal the characters to begin to dissolve into other forms, and Lidia cries out that she has finally reached her dream, " ¡ [u]n hogar sólido ! ¡ Eso soy yo ! ¡ Las losas de mi tumba! " (34). In this final scene the spaces of the nation represented by the barracks and the cemetery merge through the sound of the trumpet and the characters' dissolution into universal forms. In their decomposition, the characters join with all other organic forms in the nation bringing an appease- ment between contraries not always possible during life. Through Lidia, as we have seen, the diverse historical tensions of the European and the indigenous also find their reconciliation. The Body of a Text/Bodies on Stage These complex dialects of history and ontology which Garro' s play attempts to harmonize find an even deeper meaning when analyzed through staging. As suggested through Doyle's quote at the beginning of this study, the dramatic performance permits a unique entrance into another segment of life, into another psyche. Therefore, the traditional text/performance split that has characterized our understanding of the dramatic genre is never fully fleshed out in the tradi- tional classroom because most instructors rely solely on a literary approach to studying theatrical works. In order to slip into these other geographic, economic, and psychological</page><page sequence="8">Pedagogía de la Participación 769 worlds, students must also make contact with the body of a text through their own embodied rendering of the material. Thus, in adding a phenomenological slant to Garro's play, not only do some of the external barriers to cultural understanding fall away, but so too do the internal structural oppositions within the play. This, as we shall see, is the very essence of Garro's message, for as Susan Bennet reminds us: "[cjultural assumptions affect performance, and performances rewrite cultural assumptions" (2). This bi-directional movement that theatrical activity initiates is important in the context of Garro's play because it appeals to both a cultural exchange and an intellectual one. In Gavin Bolton's book Drama as Education (1984), the notion of enactment is central because it allows access to a "special state of consciousness" on the part of the performer (162). While the dramatic event can never surpass or replace the direct experience, Bolton finds that its "potency lies in 'metaxis,' a heightened state of consciousness that holds two worlds in the mind a the same time" (142). In the theatrical event, the fictitious world "is actively construed, so that submitting to its experience is tempered by the treatment of it as object" and as a result "it is a form of experiencing that 'brackets off an occurrence, permitting both a submission and an enhanced degree of detachment" (Bolton 142, original emphasis). Consequently, for Bolton, "[d]ramatic action as a tool for learning then rests in its capacity (1) to separate and objectify an event and (2) to break down established concepts and perceptions" (142^43). This fracturing and detachment from objects and concepts, however, is tempered by the emphasis on the group's production. Bolton proposes that "[b]ecause it is a group enterprise, there is a natural striving towards 'finding a public voice,' towards having one's feelings and thoughts publicly tested, towards collaborative meaning" (163). In this way, a live performance of the dead in Mexico through Garro's play becomes a means that allows students to cross international, political, and ontological borders. By holding two worlds in their consciousness at once, students not only make comparisons between their own world and that of Mexico, but also examine the duality present within the Mexican nation, as well. Significantly, Garro's play goes beyond a simple dialectic of worlds. The final scenes point obviously to a dissolution of a strict binary, opting instead for an expansion of what we think of as the divide between body and mind or body and soul as characters are broken down and transformed into various particles of the fabric of life. In turn, through this broadening of consciousness Garro makes an implicit argument for an enhanced view of Mexican identity. Like the intellectuals of the 1920s, Garro proposes a direction for the nation through art. Her mid- twentieth-century play calls for a nation that can overcome the fractures of the past that have divided it and find solid ground on which to build its metaphorical home. The "house for the dead" that Garro's characters inhabit provides a synergistic interaction between various genera- tions not possible in life. It also affords the characters an opportunity to become a part of the future as they meld with such things as bonbons, dogs, and other figures in the world. Thus, what is at issue is how the body embodies one and/or all others. When the characters mistake their bones for each others' in the crypt, when their bones fuse with the Mexican soil, and when they become part of another's body as they do in the end of the play, Garro places the body at the center of the ontological debates about dualisms and her response seems to be one which stresses a synthesis not unlike the philosophical movement of Neo-Confuscianism, which was popular from the eleventh to the seventeenth century in China (Leder 156). The kind of universal connectedness that Garro addresses in her play is present in the one- body principle of Neo-Confuscianism. Drew Leder's The Absent Body (1990) helps in under- standing this concept, and he identifies several means (moral, aesthetic, and spiritual) by which it can achieved: compassion for others, aesthetic openness to the world (which he terms absorp- tion), and communion (161). Through compassion, one shares another's sorrow, joy, mourning, or celebration (161). An aesthetic sensitivity allows us to take in a landscape, work of art, or objects from everyday life and become absorbed into a larger body (164-65). In this state, "the boundaries between inner and outer world become porous" and the world can penetrate the senses (165). Finally, communion comprises the practices "found at the heart of the world's</page><page sequence="9">770 Hispania 92 December 2009 spiritual traditions and take the form of ritual, prayer, meditation, and the like" and these are employed in such a way as to "realize a relationship to that which is felt to be the ground of being" or "facilitate a sense of involvement with the All" ( 1 68). As Leder argues, the traditional Cartesian model cannot fully account for an "embodied regard for that which is larger and greater than the self because it relies on notions of the body as a "force of deception and limitation and [is] onto- logically identified with sheer presence. It is an object with a clearly defined location and boundaries" (173). Therefore, when one accesses this principle of "forming one body," corporeality is, as the phrase suggests, "not simply an obstacle to spiritual experience but can be central to its realization" (168). In this way the body becomes the conduit for the encounter. In Garro' s play, all three forms of the principle can be explored. Through Muni and Lidia, the characters and the audience are able to connect with the suffering these two reveal in their conversations. Allegorically, this pain is extended to the nation itself which has weathered rape, colonization, wars, and inequality. The work as a whole allows both the public and the actors to embody an aesthetic experience which provides the kind of "bidirectional incorporation" that Leder envisions through absorption, as they simultaneously inhabit the theatrical, metaphorical, and "real" world of Mexico through Garro's play. This echoes what Bert O. States suggests about immersion in the theatrical event. For States, the theatrical spectacle is one of "co-presence" in which "what we have consented to disbelieve (reality) and the belief that we have temporarily 4 willed' in its place (the illusion)" exist not as separated and bracketed realities, but rather as one (29). Finally, the characters' religious aspirations in the final scene of the play blend the individual lives of these dead figures with a greater power in the solar and celestial orders of the Catholic and Aztec traditions in Mexico. As Julie A. Winkler reminds us, for Garro's characters: "a solid home comes to mean unity in the form of communion with God" - a deity which is given different meanings within diverse cultures, as we have seen (15). Embodying and Enacting Death: Constructing a Solid Home The fulcrum around which these unions form and revolve is the actor. The incorporeal aspect suggested through death is tied to the live body of the actor, thereby providing a foundation upon which the notion of the universal body comes into play. Images of death and all that they conjure up in Mexico are evoked through the live dimensions of performance. This paradox is reminiscent of the one we associate with theater as a "paradigmatic place for the dis- play of the drama of presence and absence" (28). In the theatrical spectacle there is "a deliberate collaboration between its frontside ('on' stage) and its backside ('off) whereby anticipation is created through acts of entrance and exit (the recoil of the world beyond) and finally between the frontside illusion (character and scene) and the backside reality (the actor, the unseen stage brace that 'props' up the illusion)" (States 28). Just as Garro's actors re-present history through their absence as dead characters, so too does the theater present the illusion of Mexico through its absence. The actor and the unseen brace of the stage that .States describes are fundamental because they carry the illusion, but also connect it to reality - in this case, the story of Mexico's history and national quest for solidity. The text alone is not capable of revealing this duality and paradox. Therefore, as Stanton B. Garner's Bodied Spaces (1994) reminds us, research into the phenomenological offers a more "experientially intricate understanding of the text than tradi- tional dramatic criticism has tended to provide" (7).12 For Garner, a phenomenological approach "uncovers a field of perceptual and corporeal activitiy that exists as latency within the text" and seeks to "reembody, materialize the text, draw out this latency" - something which neo-Aristo- telianism has rejected in favor of the "abstract and the conceptual" (7). Just as Garner seeks to transcend the "scriptocentrism" that deconstruction has emphasized by bringing a phenome- nological approach to the conversation, so too does Garro aspire to unite the competing factions of the Mexican nation through the incorporation of all bodies into one. Building a solid home, the action which is framed as the goal for the characters within the play, and metaphorically extended to the nation, cannot be accomplished when there is a cracked</page><page sequence="10">Pedagogía de la Participación 771 foundation, as Garro suggests. Despite obvious obstacles, Garro' s play demonstrates a way in which difference can be overcome and unity solidified through compassion, absorption, and communion. She employs the images of death in much the same manner as Lomnitz argues the intellectuals of the 1920s did - as a new direction for the nation, one which combines the past, present, and future. Thus, death is seen not as a concept of finality or weakness. Instead, death is embraced as a marker of co-presence between competing notions of vitality embodied in the concepts of tradition and innovation, indigenous and European discourses, religious, economic, and secular practices, as well as ideal and corrupt behaviors. This simultaneity is further accen- tuated through live performance. When student-actors step into and en-liven the dead body of the theatrical Mexican cadavers, they straddle the cultural and geographic divisions that nor- mally separate the two. Through "metaxis" they inhabit two very different worlds, both on the stage and behind the stage. Whereas on the one hand, they are subject to the detachment of viewing the theatrical world as an object, they are also reminded of the crucial interplay between the ficticious and "real" worlds that is mediated through the body. The distinct geographies, topographies, historical frames, cultural assumptions, social practices, and perceptions of ex- perience found in the various generations of the Mexican crypt and the many members of the audience (including the actors) find a point of exchange through the portal of the body. Through the body the universal oneness which Garro sought is carried out via decay and regeneration in the script; in the classroom, the body of one principle is accomplished through the added layer of performance. NOTES •Julie A. Winkler supports this idea: Although the physical aspect of the stage emphasizes separation, at the level of ideas most of the characters demonstrate a desire for unity, manifested in the concept of "un hogar sólido." Certainly a crypt made of stone would seem to represent the epitome of solidness, yet as the action progresses, it becomes apparent that the phrase refers to much more than just the weight and thickness of the structure: little by little, an additional signified surfaces for the original signifier. [...] While the windowless, doorless and seemingly impermeable box that comprises the set certainly depicts solidity, "un hogar sólido" clearly does not refer exclusively to the tomb, nor to any physical structure, but rather to a mental state in which security and spiritual unity become the goal. (13-14) 2As my student Diana Rangel expressed about Garro' s play in written form after acting in it, esta obra, la cual es una obra mexicana, se parece mucho a los poemas que en México les dicen calaveras o calaveritas. En estos poemas los personajes principales son Calaveras con nombres de personas en vida [...]. Me parece ser también que igual como las calaveras, esta obra fue escrita para ser actuada durante las festividades del Día de los Muertos. Creo también que otra similitud entre la obra y las Calaveras es que tratan de hacerle burla a la muerte. Algo que sin duda sí hace esta obra es que hace que la audiencia refleje un poco sobre la vida después de la muerte, (personal interview, literal transcription) 3It is impossible to mention socio-cultural aspects like death without referring to Octavio Paz' s canonical text, El laberinto de la soledad (1950), which contains the chapter, "Todos santos, Día de muertos." As Lomnitz's forerunner, Paz affirms that for Mexicans, "nuestra muerte ilumina nuestra vida" (59). Paz reminds his reader of Aztec sacrifices and the cosmic and cyclical view of life held in pre-Colombian Mexico, the change from collective to personal sacrifice with the introduction of Christianity, and the "modern" conception of death as meaningless. As Paz states, "[l]a muerte mexicana es el espejo de la vida de los mexicanos. Ante ambas el mexicano se cierra, las ignora" (63). Garro refutes this notion as her characters show that death can be transcendental and meaningful, uniting diverse ideologies and ontological constructs. 4Lynn V. Foster characterizes the Mexican Revolution as the most devastating civil war in Mexican history [...]. In the ten years of its military phase, between 1910 and 1920, as many as two million people may have been killed, or one out of every eight Mexicans. Trains were blown up, haciendas were burned, and corruption prevailed. Yet the Mexican Revolution created new political structures and produced the Constitution of 1917. It destroyed the privilege of the Creole and gave birth to the mestizo nation. It ended feudalism and peonage and created labor unions and redistributed land. It gave birth to such Mexican heroes as Emiliano Zapata and Lázaro Cárdenas and such Mexican artists as</page><page sequence="11">772 Hìspania 92 December 2009 Diego Rivera. The revolution gave Mexicans a sense of national pride and a deeply-held appreciation for their own culture, called mexicanidad. (161) 5The campaign against left-wing rival Andrés Manuel López was widely seen by the Mexican population as corrupt and the impartiality of the electoral process was questioned by many, including López. The results were finally validated on September 5, 2006 by the Federal Electoral Tribunal, although many still consider the election to be fraudulent. 6In an amusing scene, Catita, Clemente and Gertrudis reinforce the traditions of the Día de los Muertos with their own crumbling bodies: GERTRUDIS: Tía Catita, ¿dónde olvidó usted el femur de Clemente? CATITA: ¡Jesusita! ¡Jesusita! !Me quieren quitar mi cometa! MAMA JESUSITA: ¡Gertrudis, deja en paz a esta niña! Y en cuanto a ti, te diré: no es tan malo que mi niña enfermara, como la maña que le quedara. . . GERTRUDIS: ¡Pero, mamá! No seas injusta: ¡es el fémur de Clemente! CATITA: ¡Fea! ¡Mala! !Te pego! No es su femur, es mi cornetita de azúcar! (17) 7 Juárez was first elected president in March 1861. He was deposed in April 1862 with the French inter- vention, and finally regained the presidency in 1867 with the restoration of the Republic after defeating the French. 8As Brian R. Hamnett argues, "[t]he execution of [Maximilian] was intended to be a powerful deterrent to European monarchies which sought to intervene in the affairs of American republics. The symbolism of an Austrian Habsburg, descendant of the Emperor Charles V, put to death on a hill in central Mexico by a squad of dark mestizo soldiers was lost on no one" (170-71, original emphasis). Through Juárez, "Mexico's future would lie in the hands of the triumphant liberals, determined after 1867 to give the Reform Laws full effect" (Hamnett 171). However, "long-lasting divisions within the Liberal camp ultimately undermined attempts to establish solidly the constitutional provisions of 1857" (171). Born out of European ideas during the Enlightenment, the reform measures of 1857 "sought to reduce the role of the Catholic Church in society" (158). This included especially the redistribution of the Church's property to Mexican families. 9General Porfirio Díaz initially began his career as a reformer: "after joining the army, he became a national hero of the Liberal cause during the battle of Cinco de Mayo. Later he liberated the capital, as well as Puebla and Oaxaca, from the French and took up a position in Congress under Juárez" (Foster 144). As Foster recounts, "[initially Diaz tried to get himself elected president legitimately, arguing that Juárez and Lerdo, by seeking re-election, were despots not democrats. After losing [...] [he] led an armed revolt on the principle of 'no re-election" (144). Paradoxically, this principle would guide his presidency of a little more than three decades as he maintained a façade of legal elections while assassinating dissenters and hand-picking opponents to lose (144). While Diaz was able to modernize the country and provide an iron fist for stability, he did so at the price of foreign dependency at the level of industry and investment. 10Traci Roberts-Camps makes a similar argument for Garro's novel Los recuerdos del porvenir (1963), using Gaston Bachelard' s theories of space as they refer to the house: "A few questions that arise regarding Los recuerdos del porvenir include how this compares to the house of Ixtepec and whether the inhabitants of Ixtepec are able to imagine an oneiric house if, as in several examples to come, the physical houses of Ixtepec are not safe spaces for solitude and daydreams" (9). For Bachelard, the house provides a body of images that are associated with stability - be they real or imagined. Thus the oneiric house provides an ideal, if illusory, notion of a safe haven. Roberts-Camps finds that the narrator of the novel, who exists outside of linear time, occupies in some ways a safe space of the sort suggested by Bachelard (9). In many ways, the characters of Un hogar sólido create a similar space outside of normal temporal constraints as they are reunited in the crypt without regard to the natural progression of generations. Their tomb functions as a safe and idyllic domicile (both physically and psychologically) for a family which has been involved in national and personal tragedies. Their dream of a solid home echoes Bachelard' s oneiric home as a repository for stability. 11 See Anderson's work for a more complete discussion of Aztec influences. Especially noteworthy is his line "en la cosmogonía azteca, por ejemplo, algunos seres sobrenaturales viajaban entre el cielo y la tierra por medio de 'un tenue hilo de araña' (Caso 123)" (101). 12Put another way, Stanton B. Garner insists that theatrical performances are always inevitably contingent on outside factors such as history, "features of the phenomenal 'inside' (the subject's interaction with objects, for instance) are always subject to the impingement of a historical 'outside' that can never fully be bracketed from consideration" (9). Thus, like States, Garner argues for a kind of co-presence. WORKS CITED Aguilar Camín, Héctor, and Lorenzo Meyer. In the Shadow of the Mexican Revolution: Contemporary Mexican History, 1910-1989.
