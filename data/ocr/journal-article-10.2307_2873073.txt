<plain_text><page sequence="1">MILTON AND THE MYSTERIOUS TERMS OF HISTORY BY JOHN ROGERS As it threads through the wandering mazes of free will, provi- dence, and historical necessity, Paradise Lost broods continually on the nature of historical causation. But in its depictions of the origins and consequences of the fall, Milton's poem exhibits at the same time a certain reticence concerning the precise nature of providence and historical change. Milton is perhaps never more self-consciously vague about the forces of change than in his por- trayal of the Father's determination to exercise justice upon the figure most instrumental to the fall: yet God at last To Satan first in sin his doom appli'd, Though in mysterious terms, judg'd as then best. (10.171-73)' The terms of the transformation that Satan will later undergo, in his spectacular Ovidian metamorphosis from fallen angel to serpent, and his projected defeat by the Son, are unquestionably mysteri- ous: we are left merely to speculate about the mechanics of God's application of Satan's doom, about God's causal role in this strange alteration, and about the relation of this curiously ad hoc execution of poetic justice, "judg'd as then best," to the workings of "Eternal Providence." Like all of the changes after the fall in Paradise Lost, Satan's punishment is represented explicitly as an act ofjustice; his doom constitutes a single instance in the judicial process which is always coincidental in Milton's justifiable universe with the course of history itself. In the case of the "mysterious terms" that govern Satan's eventual punishment, Milton coyly withholds any detailed justification of the ways of God. But in the remaining two books of Paradise Lost, he resumes the problem of the terms of providence and justice. With an almost disquieting degree of precision and detail, Milton delineates in these last books the patterns of sin and punishment that come to comprise the rest of human history. It is perhaps because Milton's epic can seem so complex an eti- ology of original sin, so intent on the subtlest matters of motive, the 281</page><page sequence="2">slightest precipitants to alteration, as well as on the tragic effects of history's heaviest change, that the last two books which address directly the subject of human history strike most readers as a dis- appointment. When in books 11 and 12 Milton justifies the ways of God as they have been revealed by scripture, he does so by staging a lesson in future history which has traditionally been seen to lack the expansive, humanistic sense of change that the rest of the poem so strongly evinces. In the last thirty years, however, there has been a welter of criticism concerning the historical outlook that shapes the prophetic vision which Michael vouchsafes to Adam. Armed with the critical intent of apology, Miltonists have embarked on the "recognized and official project" Stanley Fish has identified as "the rehabilitation of Books XI and XII."2 Careful to position the promi- nent seventeenth-century poet and statesman more or less comfort- ably within a particular historiographical school, scholars have stu- diously unveiled those structures internal to the last books which are seen to illuminate Milton's historical consciousness.3 But in their attempts to justify Michael's particular version of the ways of God, they have situated the theology of the last books at the center of the poem, forging an identification between Michael and Milton that displaces the larger function of Michael's disconcertingly prov- idential history within the poem as a whole. I, too, am interested in exploring the mysterious terms that con- stitute Milton's elusive philosophy of history. But I do not want to limit this understanding to an analysis of the recognizably "historical" discourses that surface in books 11 and 12. Nor do I want to dismiss as an invalid interpretive key the sense of disap- pointment that so often accompanies a reading of those books. Throughout Paradise Lost, implicit figurations of historical change emerge in contexts outside the conventionally historiographical ex- position of world events presented by Michael. "Say first what cause," Milton bids the Heavenly Muse near the beginning of the poem, invoking the epic tradition to introduce the problem perhaps most central to the discipline of history, the determination of cause. In justifying the causes and effects of a single human action, the original sin, Milton engages the discourses of theology, psychology, physiology, and both moral and natural philosophy. This essay will explore some of these less obviously historical considerations of cause and effect that shape the end of Milton's narrative, and it will look in particular at the epic's climactic scene of expulsion. The various accounts of the expulsion will be seen to force upon the 282 Milton and History</page><page sequence="3">poem's conclusion a conflict among competing historiographical postures that works to resolve the question of historical cause with which the epic opens. Before I assess Milton's representation of that sad effect of the fall, I want first to rehearse a familiar chapter in the history of ideas in order to evoke the range of concerns Milton might have associ- ated with the problem of causation. Before the beginning of the seventeenth century, there was little concern among theologians and philosophers to pursue the question of cause beyond Aquinas's understanding of God as the primary and ultimate cause of all events. For much of the early modern period, the philosophy of history, like the scholastic study of physics, tended to confirm a view of all change as the manifestation of God's arbitrary manipu- lation of forces on earth, a belief in direct divine determinism-a theological position often called "voluntarism"-which the influ- ence of Calvinism supported and strengthened.4 But the celebrated advances in the field of natural philosophy seemed to encourage a certain divergence from the radical Protestant conceptions of cause and effect.5 In imagining the universe as a continuum of matter, irrespective of divine origin, spiritual infusion, or transcendent pur- pose, proponents of the new materialist philosophies could articu- late change in the natural world as the motion of bodies in time and space. By challenging the orthodox scholastic notion that God acts as the "constant impelling force" behind all sublunary change, Ga- lileo, for instance, introduced the daring principle of inertia: his studies in astronomy led him to conclude that a "constant exertion of force is not required to account for the incessant motions of the heavens, since motion, like immobility, once in being, will persist until affected by some force."6 Through the assertion that objects can move in space without external pressure, without even the gentlest shove from the divine hand, Galilean physics served to liberate the idea of change and causation from the direct influence of the Prime Mover. It is no longer held among intellectual historians that the dis- semination of materialist explanations automatically ushered in an age of secularism: few philosophers of the seventeenth century could be said to have abandoned Aquinas's faith in God as the first cause and creator of the physical world. But the discourse of mate- rial causation, while it did not necessitate an atheism, tended to substitute the figure of God as the constant source of change and motion with what could suddenly be articulated as a law of motion, John Rogers 283</page><page sequence="4">a law that was eternal, uniform, and perhaps even inviolable. The power attributed to God and to providence in the general process of earthly change could be pushed as far back as the creation, to God's initial establishment of the natural laws governing the cosmos. The relation of natural law to divine omnipotence posed a problem that was subjected, under many guises and for many ends, to perpetual negotiation throughout the century. It is in the context of this dis- cursive conflict, this worried attribution of historical cause either to God, to a stable natural law, or to some mysterious conjunction of the two, that I propose we examine the formulations of historical change in Paradise Lost. As illustrated by his Ramist treatise, The Art of Logic, and his rigorous use of Ramist method in his Christian Doctrine, Milton is often led to ground his analysis of the consequences of human action in the logical determination of cause and effect. Milton's protestant temperament led him to question the validity of sacra- mental or symbolic connections among events, and it is therefore as a series of logical consequences of that pernicious cause, the fall, that he presents the course of human history in Paradise Lost. Mil- ton, of course, would never have embraced a materialism, like that of Hobbes or Descartes, which excluded the spirit from interaction with the physical universe; he asserted rather a material monism that posited the infusion of body with spirit. He did, however, share with the many materialist thinkers of his age the growing interest in the intermediate processes of natural motion, and their ethical con- comitants, the natural, human causes of the change of events. Al- though his work everywhere acknowledges the primacy of first and final causes, his Christian Doctrine and Paradise Lost convey a particular emphasis on the philosophical and ethical implications of the new material laws of motion; they comprise a unique version of the late seventeenth-century project of reconciling the mechanistic conception of nature with the Christian idea of providence. I will argue in this essay that a decidedly idiosyncratic formulation of physical change supplies Milton with an important and compelling vehicle for his analysis of eternal providence and the movement of history itself. As the epic's title should suggest, the point at which the first parents are actually forced to lose their paradise constitutes an im- portant narrative crux. I propose that we assess some of the histori- cal assumptions behind the last books by examining two passages that articulate the actual loss of paradise-the Father's explanation 284 Milton and History</page><page sequence="5">to his Son of the necessity of the expulsion, and his subsequent induction of the warrior angel Michael to effect this first leave- taking. In the first scene, the Son has been pleading with the Father that man's sins be engrafted onto the Son himself. In a display of mercy, the Father accepts the Son's sacrifice and promises that man will indeed be saved; but the Father then qualifies his offer of redemption with the following condition: But longer in that Paradise to dwell, The Law I gave to Nature him forbids: Those pure immortal Elements that know No gross, no unharmonious mixture foul, Eject him tainted now, and purge him off As a distemper, gross to air as gross, And mortal food, as may dispose him best For dissolution wrought by Sin, that first Distemper'd all things, and of incorrupt Corrupted. (11.48-57) In explaining to the Son the limitations of his mercy, the Father describes what will be the necessary expulsion of Adam and Eve from the garden. In the context of the Son's request for mercy, the Father's account of this particular punishment of Adam and Eve assumes the status of theodicy: given the considerable investment the poem has generated in the notion of paradise, the theodicial project behind Paradise Lost requires at least an attempt to absolve God of direct responsibility for its loss. Although, the Father leads us to understand, he would like to pardon fully the sinful pair, the laws of nature established at the creation prohibit man's further habitation in the garden. He justifies what might otherwise appear to be a callous lack of mercy by an appeal to an even higher prin- ciple of irrevocable natural law. In a pantheistic description of mat- ter in motion, the Father represents the heavy change of the expul- sion as a lamentable interaction of material particles. "Earth, Flood, Air, Fire," those four "immortal Elements" composed of "embryon Atoms," cannot but follow the inevitable physical laws of chemical balance and the motion of bodies (3.715, 2.898-900, 11.51). These eternal operations of nature which preserve the purity of paradise will themselves automatically respond to the fall by ejecting tainted man from the garden's harmonious air. Although Milton's critics have traditionally dismissed this pas- sage as the Father's temporary indulgence in a vaguely scientific, John Rogers 285</page><page sequence="6">almost alchemical, conceit intended to vindicate the punishment, the poem itself casts no doubt on the narrative validity of this de- scription of the mechanics of expulsion. In fact, this corpuscular, Lucretian description of the expulsion confirms the metaphysics of matter that Raphael has already authoritatively expounded to Adam.7 Just as the body is inseparable from the spirit in Milton's monistic ontology, the workings of the Father's harmoniously bal- anced, material universe are indissoluble from the moral laws of heaven: by reason of the goodness inherent in all matter, material processes exercise their own highly moral form of justice as they follow inexorably the laws of nature which the Father has established.8 Nature, according to Raphael, is "one first matter all," and this fully spiritualized material universe permits morally supe- rior substance to "sublime" until "body up to spirit work" (5.468- 90). The animism of the poem's universe thus allows matter to proceed up to the maker "if not deprav'd from good" (5.471). At- tending the fall of man, however, is a certain "dissolution wrought by Sin," and like the rebel angels, who were "purest at first, now gross by sinning grown" (6.661), Adam and- Eve have undergone a process of physical deterioration, or, rather, a solidifying of matter that before the fall had been lighter and more attenuated. It is precisely that natural, quasi-alchemical process by which Adam's and Eve's "bodies may at last turn all to spirit, / Improv'd by tract of time" (5.497-98), which must now react to the new disproportion of humors and elements brought on by the couple's ingestion of the forbidden fruit. Like the divine process of creation that purges off the matter of abyss in order to form the orderly universe (7.237-39), the natural world of paradise which carefully maintains its atmo- spheric equilibrium must now purge the gross natures of the dis- sipated pair. Despite its many affiliations with the monistic universe that Raphael describes, surely the most striking aspect of the Father's naturalistic representation of the expulsion is its utter lack of re- semblance to the narrative of expulsion we encounter in the re- mainder of books 11 and 12. The poem, of course, does not continue in this vein to represent the expulsion as the unavoidable conse- quence of material forces, as some fantastic struggle between warring humors and elements that ends, in a manner more suited perhaps to science fiction, with the spontaneous purgation of the physically degenerate couple from paradise. The narrative pro- ceeds, rather, in a considerably different, far more conventional 286 Milton and History</page><page sequence="7">mode, and this second version of the expulsion begins immediately after the Father's conversation with the Son. The Father now an- nounces his intentions to the entire heavenly community: Lest therefore his now bolder hand Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat, And live for ever, dream at least to live For ever, to remove him I decree, And send him from the Garden forth to Till The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soil. (11.93-98) Purged of the hint of mercy and regret that softened the Father's earlier justification of the expulsion, this stern decree posits an entirely new rationale for the deportation of Adam and Eve. Con- cerned now to ensure himself of the first couple's punishment, the Father does not just leave justice to a chain of earthly causes; he must rather intervene in the realm of nature to prevent Adam and Eve from indulging in the tree of life, the fruit whereof, he freely admits, might allow them to do no more than "dream at least to live / For ever." In order to forestall further transgression, the Father effects this punitive decree by appointing Michael to expel Adam and Eve: Michael, this by behest have thou in charge Haste thee, and from the Paradise of God Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair, From hallow'd ground th' unholy, and denounce To them and to thir Progeny from thence Perpetual banishment. Yet lest they faint At the sad Sentence rigorously urg'd, For I behold them soft'nd and with tears Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide. (11.99-111) In this scenario of expulsion, the Father acts as judge and pro- nounces sentence on the sinful pair, actually enjoining an emissary angel to drive the couple bodily from their home. Far from envi- sioning the expulsion as a natural, elemental reaction to human sinfulness, this passage expresses the poem's predominant fictive mode of a direct interaction between man and his entirely personal God. While the poem's first, naturalistic explanation of the expul- sion asserts a sense of an absolute, but impersonal, natural justice, the remainder of the epic focuses on the retributive justice of an John Rogers 287</page><page sequence="8">anthropomorphized deity. In this second, anthropomorphic repre- sentation of the expulsion, characterized by the narrative as God's more "official" declaration to his Synod of the Blest, Milton's Fa- ther emerges as the stern lawgiver, actively intervening to execute punishment, "judg'd as then best," on a world which seems con- stantly to require such vigilance. Between these two versions of the expulsion, between the Fa- ther's conversation with the Son and this public sentence of the expulsion among the angels, a vision of natural principles at work in an orderly universe has yielded to an image of the willful and arbitrary execution of justice by an anthropomorphic messenger of God. From a certain logical vantage point, the two explanations of the expulsion may not be so different: the scientific rationale of the inevitability of natural law ("the law I gave to Nature him forbids") and the voluntary sentence of divine intervention ("to remove him I decree") both point to the Father as the ultimate, first, cause of this event. But although this narrative disjunction may not force us to question ultimate cause, it profoundly affects the way we are to imagine the working out of the secondary principles behind the punishment of the fall. If we ask of the expulsion the narrator's earlier question, "What cause?," the poem's two explanations pro- vide us with fundamentally conflicting answers. The expulsion is a matter either of logical or juridical consequence: either the first sin results naturally-in accordance with autonomous physical laws- in the spontaneous evacuation of the couple from paradise, or the fact of that sin requires a transcendent, punitive God to intercede in the realm of nature and forcibly eject the first parents from their home. As models of Milton's cosmic ontology, these depictions of the expulsion affirm incompatible positions on the question of the self- sufficiency of the natural world. But despite this rather glaring philosophical and narrative discontinuity, critics of the last books, nearly all of whom have sought to graft a theological consistency onto the poem, have remained silent about the contradiction. John Broadbent, it is true, has noted in passing the "logical discom- fiture" that emerges from the juxtaposition of these divergent accounts.9 But since the import of the scene is critical to Paradise Lost-the expulsion representing nothing less than the loss of paradise-the considerable disparity between the two narratives deserves more attention than mere dismissal. It is my assump- 288 Milton and History</page><page sequence="9">tion that the "logical discomfiture" which arises from the disparity between God's naturalistic explanation to the Son and his more public statement to Michael is rather more than an inconsequen- tial poetic blunder. The confusion reflects in an acute form some of the poem's profoundest contradictions in historical and theological justification. At issue in the striking disparity between the two versions is the nature of history itself, the operation of the forces of historical cause and effect. And at the center of this narrative contradiction lies precisely that which Milton has intended to justify to men, the ways of God. In the first passage, the Father's evocation of the garden's natural justice bespeaks a deity who, having established a set of natural and moral laws which the material world must obey, can now allow his self-governing universe to run quite well on its own. Approaching a materialist, almost Hobbesian vision of the autono- mous laws of nature, this naturalistic justification recalls the Fa- ther's earlier promises of noninterference at the debate in heaven (3.93-130) and at the creation (7.170-72), important arguments against the immediacy of God as an efficient cause in the realm of worldly affairs. Although it possesses an absolute moral validity and occurs within the divinely sanctioned realm of nature, the natural atmospheric reaction to the sinful couple cannot really be con- strued as a divinely willed judicial punishment.'0 According to the schema of natural justice that emerges in this passage, the Father does not assess the crime and punish the couple accordingly; he must leave justice, rather, to an earthly chain of causation that will effect their punishment naturally. The ontological distinction between the two modes of divine causation portrayed in the expulsion narratives emerges in a some- what different form in Milton's Christian Doctrine. As a theologian, Milton articulates this distinction in modes of divine action as a difference between two types of providence, the "ordinary" and the "extraordinary." His definition of "extraordinary providence" imputes volition to the deity, reflecting the more familiar orthodox understanding of divine providence that we find in the second, public, statement on the expulsion: The extraordinary providence of God is that by which he pro- duces some effect outside the normal order of nature or gives to some chosen person the power of producing this effect. This is what we call a miracle. John Rogers 289</page><page sequence="10">Thus God alone is the primary author of miracles, as he alone is able to invert the order of nature which he has appointed. (CPW, 6:341) Milton is loath in the theological tract to relinquish the verisimili- tude of the miracles recorded in Scripture. "God," Milton main- tains, "has not absolutely decreed all things" (CPW, 6:156), and can therefore "invert the order of nature" at whim. Informing the en- actments of "extraordinary providence" throughout the epic, this assertion of the possibility of miraculous intervention can be seen to provide the doctrinal foundation for the mythopoeic account of God's instructions to Michael to hasten the pair from the garden. Under the heading of "ordinary providence" we find Milton's definition of that irrevocable law which, as we have seen, the God of Paradise Lost has given to nature: "God's ordinary providence is that by which he maintains and preserves that constant and ordered system of causes which was established by him in the beginning" (CPW, 6:340). We can see here the way in which Milton's notion of ordinary providence, a rhetorical assimilation of the fairly recent "scientific" conception of natural law to Christian doctrine, could begin to assume the appearance of an independent natural realm almost secular in its autonomy. Milton the theologian, however, hastens to dispel any of the Hobbist overtones produced by this naturalized providence: "This is commonly and indeed too fre- quently called Nature: for nature cannot mean anything except the wonderful power and efficacy of the divine voice which went forth in the beginning, and which all things have obeyed ever since as a perpetual command" (CPW, 6:340-341). Milton insists that the providential force known as nature received its original empower- ment by God. But since its inception by the divine voice, the law of nature is nonetheless said to hold perpetual sway over all things. Despite Milton's stated refusal to equate ordinary providence with "nature," the logic of his argument still corresponds to the gesture of the many seventeenth-century scientific thinkers whose work had the effect of reducing "divine providence to the original scheme of creation."11, In Paradise Lost, Milton is perhaps less hesitant than he is in Christian Doctrine to suggest an equation between God and natu- ral law. When Abdiel explains to Satan that "God and Nature bid the same," he identifies God, in effect, with the rules of the natural universe that constitute ordinary providence. He defines the God of Paradise Lost not as the anthropomorphic figure of the Old Testa- 290 Milton and History</page><page sequence="11">ment, but more as the absolute, rationalistic principle envisioned by the Cambridge Platonists.'2 As we have seen from the accounts of the expulsion, the epic has inscribed in its theodicy two systems of historical thought that can be reconciled only with considerable hermeneutic finesse. The striking oppositions that arise in the poem between the impersonal, naturalistic form of explanation and that of God's retributive justice reflect a considerable tension be- tween two conceptions of the divine role in human history, atti- tudes toward history that are grounded in radically different ontologies of God. In his Christian Doctrine, as we have seen, Milton's Ramist framework allows him to juxtapose the forces of ordinary and extraordinary providence as two logically related modes of divine control: he holds tight to the idea of God's absolute freedom and omnipotence even as he forwards the irrevocable laws of nature. But in spite of his sanguine denial of theological incon- sistency in Christian Doctrine, the narrative disjunction that occurs between the two expulsion passages in Paradise Lost exposes a deeper concern with the irreconcilable differences between ordi- nary and extraordinary providence.'3 In fact, the contradiction inherent in these two conceptions of providential causation reproduces one of the most important theo- logical controversies of the later seventeenth century, the heated debates during the Commonwealth and Restoration periods con- cerning the interaction of the mechanical and the providential forces behind nature. However prevalent or widespread the incli- nation to incorporate the realm of second causes into a generally Christian etiology of change, we should not imagine that any of the attempts to reconcile God and natural law failed to arouse voluble and impassioned controversy. In fact, one of the liveliest partici- pants, the virtuoso Dr. Walter Charleton, violently opposed the idea that God was incapable of altering the course of nature at will. Any suggestion of the irreversible laws of nature, wrote Charleton, threatens God "by coercing His infinite and arbitrary activity with the definite laws of second causes, and denying Him the preroga- tive of absolute superiority to His mechanical vicegerent, or (rather) instrument, nature." A mechanical philosophy could only have the blasphemous effect of "chaining up His arms in the adamantine fetters of Destiny."'4 As the degree of anxiety fueling Charleton's rhetoric should indicate, the possibility of an autonomous realm of nature, "unchangeable, Eternal" (3.127), presented a rather serious threat to some of the most enlightened natural philosophers of the John Rogers 291</page><page sequence="12">seventeenth century. And it is precisely this insoluble conflict con- fronted by Charleton, the contradiction between the concepts of divine omnipotence and irrevocable natural law, which provides the source for some of the most fundamental inconsistencies in Milton's poem. The God of Paradise Lost is at once an impersonal embodiment of reason and an emotive, willful, executor of justice: while at one point, for example, Milton's Father expresses his im- personal identification with a larger moral structure, as he states his inability to "revoke the high Decree / Unchangeable, Eternal" (3.126-127), he later flexes his arbitrary will like the God of Calvin and boasts that his "goodness" is "free / To act or not, Necessity and Chance / Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate" (7.171- 73).15 The conflicts in the poem that these kinds of contradictions pro- duce are not, of course, confined to what may seem the rather ster- ile question of divine ontology: the tension between types of prov- idence reverberates strongly throughout the epic's consideration of human ethics. To the extent that Milton identifies the God of Par- adise Lost with the necessary laws of universal order, he follows the early seventeenth-century Dutch theologian Jacob Arminius. A principal component of Arminian theology is the subordination of God to an abstract principle of virtue: "God is good by a natural and internal necessity, notfreely."'-6 We have already seen how in Mil- ton's time this Arminian notion of the necessity of divine goodness could be displaced onto a more scientific understanding of divine necessity, the less reverent identification of God with an irrevoca- ble natural law. But whether God is identified with a principle of goodness, or a principle of physics, or as in the case of Milton, with a monistic union of the two, the doctrine of divine necessity serves a crucial theological function: it provides an important psychologi- cal sanction for the belief in its logical converse, the free will of man. As the great proponent of human free will, Arminius grounded his liberation theology on the confinement of God to a mere ab- straction of goodness. This same interdependence of the notions of divine necessity and human freedom is encapsulated for Milton in the fortuitous linguistic identity of two distinct theological con- cepts: the term law of nature encompasses both the natural force that impels the physical world and the principle of right reason imbedded in the heart of every individual, that "law of... nature so implanted and innate in [man] that he was in need of no command" (CPW, 6:353). Milton's use of the phrase to embody both internal 292 Milton and History</page><page sequence="13">and external principles is not, of course, accidental; the naturalistic subplot of Paradise Lost, in fact, works to merge the concepts of physical principle and man's moral goodness into twin aspects of a single natural law. Because this narrative of second causes and ordinary providence works to limit the capacity of the deity to rup- ture natural law and intervene in the affairs of men, Milton's naturalistic vision leaves man free to exercise his reason in accor- dance with the identifiable patterns of natural and moral conse- quence. Milton aligns himself here with the argument of the Cam- bridge Platonists, who held that if "God were not constrained by internal necessity to act as he does, then there might be no rational framework to provide significance to human choices."'7 Only in a world in which the basis of goodness and justice is exempt from the arbitrary determinations of a capricious God can it be imagined that individuals can freely employ their innate powers of reason as ef- fective agents in their own moral, and political, betterment. We must not, of course, lose sight of the fact that Milton's story of the interdependence of human freedom and divine necessity, while a substantial aspect of the poem, halts abruptly at Michael's lengthy recitals of God's interventions in the course of history. Just as Milton's scene of the induction of Michael to enforce the Fa- ther's conge is itself an assertion of the guiding hand of providence, so Michael himself envisions history as a forum for God's retribu- tive justice. Asserting a pattern of human sin and divine punish- ment which runs counter to the focus on second causes that char- acterizes Milton's naturalistic perspective, Michael emerges as the poem's premier spokesman for the theocentric theory of history. The heavenly Father Michael depicts is a "God who oft descends to visit men / Unseen ... to mark thir doings" (12.48-50), a God who laughs with malice "to see the hubbub strange / And hear the din" of the builders of Babel on whom he has placed a wicked curse. As he rehearses in schoolbook abstractions the patterns of "supernal Grace contending /With sinfulness of men," Michael's history affirms the disappointingly orthodox faith in the miracles of scripture: he preaches God's direct exercise of justice on the lives of men, "what reward / Awaits the good, the rest what punishment" (11.709-10). One of the poem's most powerful accounts of the direct interven- tion of eternal providence in human history can be found in Mi- chael's famous justification of political tyranny, an account that per- haps best exposes some of the points of contact between Milton's John Rogers 293</page><page sequence="14">poetic historiography and the political history of Restoration En- gland. In its depiction of fallen man within a specific and recog- nizable political environment, Michael's exposition of tyranny can be seen to supply rather dramatically the material content of the theology of extraordinary providence. His description of man's sub- jection to tyrants, it is true, begins with Milton's standard human- istic etiology of political ills: fallen man allows passion to rule over reason, an unlawful usurpation which diminishes his rational ca- pacity for virtuous choice (12.82-90). But as Michael continues his explanation, he quickly lifts his attribution of cause from this hu- man, psychological plane to the supernal stratum of the anger of a vengeful God: Therefore since hee permits Within himself unworthy Powers to reign Over free Reason, God in Judgment just Subjects him from without to violent Lords; Who oft as undeservedly enthral His outward freedom: Tyranny must be, Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse. Yet sometimes Nations will decline so low From virtue, which is reason, that no wrong, But Justice, and some fatal curse annext Deprives them of thir outward liberty, Thir inward lost. (12.90-101) Nations can grow so sinful, explains Michael, that it is not enough that they punish themselves with a loss of inward freedom: only the execution of divine "Justice" or "some fatal curse annext" by an external power can properly mete to a people the punishment they deserve. In consummate "Judgment just," therefore, God willfully subjects man to the scourge of earthly tyrants, a providential act which validates for Michael his chilling apothegm of Calvinist ne- cessity: "Tyranny must be." Even the most astute critics of the last books, laboring to human- ize Michael's lessons, have glossed over this unsettling instance of intervention in what is surely one of the poem's central moments of historical explanation. Thus, in attempting to naturalize Michael's account of a highly unnatural chain of cause and effect, Barbara Kiefer Lewalski writes simply that "political tyranny has its roots in the loss of true government over the self," and Mary Ann Radz- inowicz explains that "the deprivation of outer freedom is the in- 294 Milton and History</page><page sequence="15">evitable result of the surrender of inner freedom" (all italics mine). 18 Michael, however, quite clearly attaches the link of divine will to this chain of inevitability, concluding his history of political subjection by rehearsing the pattern of human sin and divine pun- ishment that had become in Milton's time a commonplace of provi- dential thought. Augustine, convinced of man's depravity and his absolute incapacity for free moral choice, had described political enslavement as a "humiliation visited on the conquered by divine judgement, either to correct or to punish their sins"; and Calvin had actually nominated the earthly monarch as "an executioner of God's wrath."'9 Given that scripture has already provided Milton with a similarly cyclical history of human sin and divine punishment, as well as with the figure of the vengeful God, Michael's doggedly traditional emphasis on divine retribution may be, to some extent, unavoidable. But the truly puzzling aspect of Michael's providen- tial justification here, one that critics consistently overlook, lies in its hostility to so many of Milton's most fundamental tenets. "Free they must remain, / Till they enthrall themselves," says Milton's God in book three (124-25), denying providential control by ab- senting himself from the causal chain that would otherwise im- prison human will. But Michael, in describing tyranny as the result of God's voluntary punishment of man, rather than man's mistaken, but voluntary, choice, forwards an explanation which contradicts not only other passages in the poem, but which jars as well with some of Milton's most impassioned accounts of sin and punishment in his political and theological prose.20 There can be little question that Michael's depictions of an in- tervening God undermine the poem's theoretical assertions of a retiring, laissez-faire divinity. And conversely, the image we have seen of the naturalistic deity poses its own threat to the poem's integrity as a story. When William Empson took up the French critic Denis Saurat's argument that Milton's God was little more than a rational, pantheistic principle, he objected that this "inter- pretation of the epic makes nonsense of most of its narrative."21 And, indeed, the notion of an impersonal deity does seem to ques- tion the intended truth-value of much of the poem's anthropomor- phic mythopoesis. We must now ask why the poem contains such radically conflicting theodicial strategies and modes of providential justification. What is the relation between the anthropomorphic history that Michael expounds and the more naturalistic sense of causation that surfaces elsewhere in the poem? What form of justi- John Rogers 295</page><page sequence="16">fication can account for these theodicial strategies so divergent that they threaten the poem's narrative integrity? I propose that we examine the possibility that this conflict between rationalistic and anthropomorphic conceptions of the deity, a tension so familiar that it was essentially constitutive of the theological debates among Milton's contemporaries, is submitted to a poetic-though not, ul- timately, a logical-resolution within the poem itself. Committed to the project of theodicy, Milton, I think, strives to master this central problem in divine ontology, and the poem can be seen to bear signs of an attempt, however inadequate, to resolve some of the contra- dictions threatening his narrative representation of theology. In order to clarify what I see to be Milton's own attention to this historiographical dialectic, let us turn to a passage that articulates the status of the pedagogical function Michael is intended to serve. In this famous enunciation of Milton's typological schema, Michael teaches Adam about the historicity of Mosaic teaching, its ulti- mately limited position on the completed course of human history: So Law appears imperfet, and but giv'n With purpose to resign them in full time Up to a better Cov'nant, disciplin'd From shadowy Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit, From imposition of strict Laws, to free Acceptance of large Grace, from servile fear To filial, works of Law to works of Faith. (300-306) Most critics have interpreted the movement from shadowy types to truth to refer only to the long race of time that is Christian history. But in employing the term "disciplin'd" to label the historical pas- sage from types to truth, Milton signals an analogy between that larger historical movement and what is surely a more familiar sense of the process of "discipline," the moral, and perhaps even puni- tive, education which Michael is bestowing upon Adam. In its evo- cation of the traditional humanist belief that historiography-what we can call today the discipline of history-is an important rhetori- cal tool for moral edification, the word "discipline" establishes the parallel between the rectilinear history that Michael relates and Michael's own place in the linear process of Adam's education, a process which will ideally emerge from the "servile fear" that Michael's legislative history seems to have induced.22 This disciplinary process is intended to move man, considered both phylogenetically and ontogenetically, "from imposition of 296 Milton and History</page><page sequence="17">strict Laws, to free / Acceptance of large Grace" (12.304-305), a movement away from divine intervention and toward a world of human choice and willful acceptance of help from above. Although these lines imply a theological consistency, through the syntactical parallel between "imposition" and "acceptance," the implicit grammatical agent behind either activity has shifted from God to man, from the divine imposition of laws to the human acceptance of divine grace. This new anthropocentric perspective has the effect of emptying the very notion of grace of its Calvinist selectivity and dependence on an arbitrary God. Although Milton can be seen here, as throughout Paradise Lost, to save the appearance of grace, the poetics of his theology suggests a certain logical slip into the Pelagian belief in a human will unaided by divinity; his syntactical construction even begins to approach Hobbes's demystifying iden- tification of divine grace with innate virtue.23 By focusing solely on the human acceptance of a general grace rather than its particular supernatural dispensation, Milton charts an historical movement from theocentrism to humanism, a passage from God's willful ex- ercise of extraordinary providence to man's exercise of free will in the more mundane sphere of ordinary providence. Insofar as Michael is functioning as a Mosaic lawgiver to Adam, his descrip- tion of the law as "imperfet" or incomplete announces the planned obsolescence of his own historical discourse. The Mosaic law exists to be abrogated, and it is this central fact of its inevitable Aufhe- bung that defines both the legalistic teaching of Moses and the providential history of Michael. Both teachers, this passage sug- gests, perform a specific function at a certain historical period which will, as man proceeds along the historical trajectory toward the better covenant, undergo an inevitable supersession by a higher mode. In the case of Michael's pedagogy, his lesson of the continual judgment from above must necessarily give way to the humanist sense of the law of nature, the exercise of right reason amid the justice inherent in the natural world. Given the movement book 12 has established from shadowy types to truth, from the Mosaic law of sin and punishment to the law of nature and its natural justice, Milton's strongly interventionist representation of the actual expulsion that follows might come as a surprise. I want now to examine in some detail the narrator's de- piction of the expulsion, the event for which the poem has, perhaps, overprepared us. The cherubim assisting Michael's expulsion de- scend from heaven to guard the gates of Paradise: John Rogers 297</page><page sequence="18">and from the other Hill To thir fixt Station, all in bright array The Cherubim descended; on the ground Gliding meteorous, as Ev'ning Mist Ris'n from a River o'er the marish glides And gathers ground fast at the Laborer's heel, Homeward returning. (12.626-32) At this exemplary instance of the poem's mythopoesis of extraordi- nary providence, Milton serenely compares the descent of the cherubim as they prepare for the expulsion to the mist that ascends from a river and follows the homeward journey of a peasant laborer. Although this narrative of angelic descent implicitly affirms God's arbitrary power to intervene in the natural realm, the poem's last extended figure raises the question of causation that can be seen to underlie all of the poem's accounts of the expulsion. Milton's simile forges a relation between the activity of the mist and the unstated, but certainly purposeful, action of the cherubim. In order to signal this relation as antithetical, the text opposes the types of motion that characterize the two sides of the simile's equa- tion-the celestial descent of the angels and the autochthonous ascent of the mist. Although the simile voices no explicitly causal link between the gliding mist and the peasant's homeward journey, the urgency behind the image of a mist that "gathers ground fast at the Laborer's heel" suggests it is, perhaps, this mist itself which dogs the laborer's step and pushes him to his appointed end. In making this force a vaporous propulsion, a force which seems to border, like Milton's angels, on the limits of the material and the immaterial, Milton surrounds this prod at the laborer's heel with an interpretive penumbra that leaves indeterminate the controlling cause of human action. In its evocation of the "rising Mist" as- sumed earlier by Satan (9.74-75, 180, 637-38), this evening mist can appear to refract the menacing glow of a demonic power. But while the image of the mist may invite a metaphorical association with a supernatural force beyond man's control, a rationalistic read- ing in line with the poem's material narrative also asserts itself. The evening mist can yield to an empirical, literalist identifica- tion with those vaporous emanations that have been represented throughout the poem as crucial operants in the vitalistic process of Milton's monistic universe. Raphael, in his account of the purgative process that impels nature to its providential end, has already ex- 298 Milton and History</page><page sequence="19">plained the importance of mists and vapors to the monistic econo- my of elements: The Sun that light imparts to all, receives From all his alimental recompense In humid exhalations. (5.423-25) In its evocation of just this alimental reciprocity at work in the process of evaporation, the simile of the evening mist suggests the materialist alternative to the act of extraordinary providence im- plicit in the descent of divine cherubim. And since, as I have ar- gued, Milton's materialism is always moral, responding naturally to the dissolution wrought by sin, these humid exhalations also per- form their function in impelling the operations of natural justice: at the fall, the earth underwent considerable "change on Sea and Land," reacting to the corruption in man with "sideral blast, I Vapor, and Mist, and Exhalation hot, / Corrupt and Pestilent" (10.693-95). The simile's engagement of a conflict between ordi- nary and extraordinary providence is perhaps best captured in Mil- ton's adjective "meteorous" (12.629), a word that describes the an- gels' gliding descent from their supernal origin in the law of God, even as it evokes the Renaissance belief that meteors originate as vaporous exhalations from the earth.24 Just as the epic narrative represents the climactic event of the expulsion as an act of heavenly manipulation, the image of the mist reminds us of the world of ordinary providence, the animistic cos- mos in which God exerts his control over man not by arbitrary judgments, but more simply by placing him among those pre- established natural laws that guide the physical forces of the wheel- ing universe. But the expulsion narrative continues as the mist-like army of cherubim proceed in their march through the garden and force the ejection of Adam and Eve from Paradise: High in Front advanc't, The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz'd Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat, And vapour as the Libyan Air adust, Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat In either hand the hast'ning Angel caught Our ling'ring Parents, and to th' Eastern Gate Led them direct. (632-39) In this powerful attestation to the strength of Michael's sword, the John Rogers 299</page><page sequence="20">sword ofjustice which has on so many occasions violently enforced the will of God (5.316-34), Milton provides us with a final reminder of that alternative vision of historical justice with which he began the story of the expulsion. Michael's sword, "with torrid heat, / And vapour as the Libyan Air adust, / Began to parch that temperate Clime," as if this heat were precisely that natural, physical reaction of "those pure immortal Elements" of Paradise that "eject [man] tainted now, and purge him off/ As a distemper" (11.50-53). Like the comparison of the punitive cherubim with the evening mist, the images of vapor and heat that Milton attributes to Michael's sword evoke the Paracelsian harmony between matter and morality which Raphael expounds; in opposition to the explicit narrative of divine intervention, these pneumatological images suggest the counter- possibility that in a reality beyond the heuristic tropes of extraor- dinary providence, the expulsion occurs by means of the mundane interaction of natural elements. It is the recognition of this systematic opposition between the attribution of cause to the arbitrary will of God and to the law God gave to nature that best prepares us, I think, to read the sense of history behind the last lines of Paradise Lost: Some natural tears they dropp'd, but wip'd them soon; The World was all before them, where to choose Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide: They hand in hand with wand'ring steps and slow, Through Eden took thir solitary way. In assigning to Adam and Eve the continued guidance of "Providence," Milton signals the conflict in the interpretation of historical cause with which this essay has been concerned: as Mil- ton's Christian Doctrine teaches us, the word providence can refer to fundamentally distinct systems of thought, and the poetic text does not immediately disclose the status of this "Providence" as ordinary, extraordinary, or both. The irreconcilability of the mean- ings of providence we have examined might suggest the possibility that the poem ends in a state of radical undecidability, that an insoluble contradiction in historical outlook disables the poem's production of a determinate definition of the first parents' guide. But, of course, the antinomies that structure Michael's lesson do not bespeak immanent contradiction so much as historical transforma- tion. It is Michael's persistent lesson of the historicity of Mosaic teaching, of the tremendous paradigm shift from types to truth, 300 Milton and History</page><page sequence="21">which should ultimately determine our interpretation of the "Providence" that oversees the poem's conclusion. I would argue that in the last books, Milton attempts to impose a linear resolution on the insoluble contradictions inherent in his dualistic sense of providence. Michael's historical narrative can be seen to chart an historical process whereby the Israelites move from dependence on heavenly guidance to a guide that can be located only within themselves (12.485-90). Much like the Israelites, who lose their angelic leader at the Incarnation, at which point they must rely upon themselves, Adam and Eve lose their pedagogical guide after the conclusion of Michael's history: In either hand the hast'ning Angel caught Our ling'ring Parents, and to th' Eastern Gate Led them direct, and down the Cliff as fast To the subjected Plain; then disappear'd. (637-40) The simple predicate, "then disappear'd," signals a momentous shift in the relationship between God and man in Paradise Lost. This moment of loss may assume a poignant, elegiac quality, but the disappearance of Michael, the angelic apotheosis of divine jus- tice, has the effect of situating Adam and Eve solely within the jurisdiction of the law of nature, that causal principle behind the natural world which is also, as Milton writes in 1659, that force which enables the internalized power of "right reason, commonly called moral law" (CPW, 7:479). In the way that the Incarnation in book 12 provides the fulcrum for the shift from imposed law to human determination, Michael's disappearance here impels the movement of Adam and Eve from God's direct control to their more solitary placement within the realm of nature. We can measure this transmutation in theological and historical consciousness by chart- ing the course of one of the most moving aspects of the poem's last lines: having watered the ground with tears spurred by "Prevenient Grace" at the end of book 10 (10.1101, 11.3), Adam and Eve have progressed through the ordeal of the last books to the stage at which "some natural tears they dropp'd," a detail that confirms their new status as solitary, though liberated, creatures in the natural world.25 Like the larger historical movement from the theocentric to the anthropocentric basis of causation, the mysterious term, "Provi- dence thir guide," seems to undergo something like a local, seman- tic transition. The naturalistic elements of the narrator's description John Rogers 301</page><page sequence="22">of the expulsion suggest the new identity of this guide as the in- violable rule of Milton's ordinary providence-that law of nature which may always work toward the moral good of man, but which can be distinguished from the direct intervention of an anthropo- morphic God. We can see how after Michael's departure, the po- em's assertion of "Eternal Providence" shifts away from the appeal to the anthropomorphic God of scripture, and moves toward the liberating faith in the uniform structure of natural and moral law. When subjected to the typological schema that Michael himself announces, the extraordinary providence of the almighty God who looms so large in Michael's history can be identified as a "shadowy type," a heuristic model useful for the proper instruction of the fallen man. And as no accommodated type is sufficient forever in itself, Michael's type of providence is fulfilled in the recognition of the truth of nature's rational control by the divinely established laws of ordinary providence. In imagining the course of human history, Milton confronts the problem of an intractable scripture which portrays a God of ven- geance and manipulation which his rationalistic theology cannot possibly justify. Although he insists in Christian Doctrine that "we ought not to imagine that God would have said anything or caused anything to be written about himself unless he intended that it should be a part of our conception of him," he nonetheless admits that "God is always described or outlined not as he really is but in such a way as will make him conceivable to us" (CPW, 6:134, 133). In Paradise Lost, Milton takes pains to preserve the image of the vengeful God of scripture as a valid "part of our conception of him." But, as I think we can see, Milton also carefully frames this tradi- tional conception of the Almighty within the confines of a scene of instruction. By so structuring his narrative, Milton justifies the God of extraordinary miracles less as an historical reality than as an important element in an historiographical exercise, a didactic dis- cursus bent on improving the ethical condition of fallen man. When in On Christian Doctrine he entertains the possibility of nonscriptural accommodations of God-one, perhaps, like his epic's rationalistic conception of the deity as natural law-Milton the theologian voices only a warning: "indeed he has brought him- self down to our level expressly to prevent our being carried be- yond the reach of human comprehension, and outside the written authority of scripture, into vague subtleties of speculation" (6:133- 34). Paradise Lost, however, as it considers the identification of 302 Milton and History</page><page sequence="23">God with the laws of natural process, moves considerably beyond the "written authority of scripture." Indeed, Milton seems in his epic to controvert his own theological admonition. As he daringly brings the subtleties of his speculation about God's natural provi- dence within reach of human comprehension, he reconceptualizes God in a manner that accords with his own natural philosophy, by outlining the deity more, perhaps, "as he really is." Although gen- erations of readers have taken solace in the continued guidance of Adam and Eve by what is assumed to be the controlling force of providence, such interpretive assumptions have failed to register the complex transformations Milton has wrought on providential philosophy. There is a sense in which Milton's stated goal to "assert Eternal Providence" may acquire its ultimate meaning from the Latin root, asserere, to declare a slave free. Paradise Lost affirms its investment in the doctrine of free will by liberating the notion of providence from the tyrannical hold of orthodox theology.26 Yale University NOTES 1 All quotations from Milton's poetry are by book and line number to John Milton: Complete Poetry and Major Prose, ed.

It has been variously argued that the last books maintain Milton's youthful, revolu- tionary faith in a divinely ordained historical progress; that he sees providence as guiding history in a direction that is inescapably cyclical and degenerative; and that he believes that history can be progressive only through some form of disciplined cooperation between God and man.

Focusing on the poet's scriptural inheritance, Schwartz constructs an orthodox Milton who rejects the influence of materialist thought. The poem's natural philosophy is mistakenly dismissed as "in- fernal theology" (26), an atheistic "[a]tomism [which] inverts the entire structure of sacred history" (25). 9 John Broadbent, Some Graver Subject: An Essay on "Paradise Lost" (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1960), 269. 10 See Alastair Fowler's note to this passage in Milton: Paradise Lost (London: Longman, 1968), 984. 1 Westfall, 86. 12 good example of the Cambridge Platonist conception of God is John Smith's comment: "Neither are the primitive rules of His economy in this world the sole results of an absolute will, but the sacred decrees of reason and goodness" ("On the Existence and Nature of God" [1660], in Smith, The Natural Truth of Christianity: Selections from the "Select Discourses," ed.

Danielson (note 4), 58-91, admirably de- scribes the difference between Calvin's doctrine of selective and "irresistible" grace, and Milton's Arminian belief in a universal and "sufficient" grace.
