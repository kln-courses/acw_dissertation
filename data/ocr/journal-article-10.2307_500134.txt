<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Season Sarcophagus in Dumbarton Oaks, by George M. A. Hanfmann. (Dumbarton Oaks Studies II.) Vol. I: pp. viii + 280; vol. II: pp. xx + 238, pls. 67 (figs. 150). Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1951. $25.00. The European observer has odd feelings when he finds long known monuments of ancient art pub- lished and investigated really adequately only after they have crossed the Atlantic. So it was with the relief of the girl with pigeons from Brocklesby Park, and so it is again with the Season sarcophagus from the Barberini collection to which the book under review is devoted. We are told the story of the piece, which has been known since the seventeenth century. The present condition, after removal of restorations (which fig- ured in the photograph published in the meantime in Mdl 2 [1949] pl. 30), is described thoroughly and analyzed from the point of view both of technique and of the place of the sarcophagus in the history of art. Hanfmann decides for the date once postu- lated by Schoenebeck, ca. A.D. 330-340 and supports it with detailed arguments. But do we really know today as much about the artistic development of the fourth century A.D. as might appear from modern literature? I should take a date ca. 350-370 to be</page><page sequence="2">1954] BOOK REVIEWS 177 quite possible, but nothing essential would be changed thereby. With this for many a scholar the publication would have been completed. The author, however, goes further. He wants not only to fix the sarcopha- gus within the series of similar monuments, but also to examine the ideological background against which the representations of the Season sarcophagi stand out. He does not make this work easy for himself, but facilitates it for the reader with exhaustive lists of monuments and thorough historical and factual discussion of the monuments and the literary sources. Thus we get no more and no less than a corpus of Season sarcophagi. Since the death of Margarethe Giutschow has made it likely that this group will not appear for some time to come in the publication begun by the German Institute, a long felt desider- atum has been supplied in a gratifying manner. Gerhart Rodenwaldt and Friedrich Matz, the leaders of the undertaking Antike Sarkophagreliefs, have made available to the author material which had been collected for decades (p. iv). But anyone who is acquainted with these collections knows how much work the author has to do himself to make it con- form in some manner to present-day standards. Hanfmann has performed this task admirably. Com- pleteness could, of course, never be obtained, but I could add only one item to the published pieces, "Le Tombeau d'un des Fils de Faustine," the vi- gnette on the title page of Recueil de Sculptures antiques Grecques et Romaines, by Lambert Sigisbert Adam (Paris, 1754). Among unpublished ones could be mentioned the right corner of a sarcophagus in the National Museum at Copenhagen: upper part of a curly-haired genius with chlamys (the attribute is lost); winged lion-griffin on the short side. In two points the author has not followed the former style of the sarcophagi corpus. He gives neither the individual description (save, of course, for the one in Dumbarton Oaks) nor the complete literature of every piece, but usually has the key references with which the other literature can be found. Secondly, the format is handier, as is also the one used by the German Institute for the Etruscan stone sarcophagi by Reinhard Herbig. The author has set himself the difficult task of arranging the sarcophagi in a stylistic series. But we are still far from being on firm ground with the art of the Roman empire of the second to fourth centuries A.D. The section on typology and history of art (pp. 16-72) reveals this abundantly. The au- thor is cautious, circumspect, and critical. In gen- eral, his judgment is to be praised. No important recent work on Roman art has been neglected. Particular objections would have to be supported - in only too great detail - with monuments that are not sarcophagi, and would, besides, alter only points of lesser importance. It suffices to say that the pres- ent level of scholarship has been presented consci- entiously. Entirely independent of dates remains the fact stated by Hanfmann that the Season sarcophagi according to their provenance and types belong to the city art of Rome (I, p. 16), from their beginning in the second, to the fourth century. This is a note- worthy result in view of the common overestimation of oriental influences in late ancient art. Its impor- tance is stressed by Hanfmann also in connection with mosaics and other monuments. The second part of the book (I, pp. 75-280) is de- voted to analogous works. The comprehensive exam- ination of the monumental and literary evidence for the seasons begins with Hesiod and the Francois vase and is carried on beyond the borders of the Middle Ages: A.D. 1887 is the latest date mentioned. Thus, a wide field is encompassed which cannot be judged with competence by a classical archaeologist, but about which it will profit him to read. From the original three female Horai of the natural seasons the way leads to the astronomical division of the year according to the solar cycle of four sea- sons. This learned concept which supplanted the naive view of the change in vegetation has remained dominant even to our days. It is first depicted in the third century B.C. in the pompe of Ptolemy Phil- adelphos (I, p. 112) and finally goes over into the representation of the four tropai. Besides the female Horai, genii as boys appear beginning with the second century A.D. (I, p. 179); from the third century on they outnumber the Horai (so too on sarco- phagi). The goddesses or nymphs of Hesiod were thus gradually replaced by the abstractions of learned astronomical observation. Hanfmann treats the individual types as whole figures, in varying movement, changing groupings and surroundings, as well as the busts, and the representations that, without personifications, give in "panoramic views" the activities of the differing seasons (I, p. 224), a long line of development from anthropomorphism to landscape. All these types, insofar as pictorial representations are known, are given in lists in the second volume. Doubtful ones, marked as such, are also included. A few remarks may be added here. Salomon Rein- ach's conjecture (Rdpertoire de Reliefs II, p. 23, no. 1) "aux quatre saisons?" on the Berlin relief "AD SORORES IIII" (Licht, Sittengeschichte 2, p. 48; von Salis, Antike und Renaissance, pl. 48 c) could have been cited.

In his left hand he carries no palm, but clearly ears of corn; his garment is not that of a charioteer. Summer is represented draped also on the sarcopha- gus from Weiden (no. 470). Along with the garlands of some sarcophagi (I, p. 216), those of the Ara Pacis could also have been mentioned, as they are not "natural," but symbolical. By uniting flowers (for spring), ears of corn (for summer), grapes, apples, and pears (for autumn), and pine-cones, olives, and ivy corymbi (for winter), they attest that, thanks to the peace, the fruits of the soil are secure. Hanf- mann refers (I, p. 164) to Virgil, Georgics 1. 24 ff., where Augustus is praised as "giver of the produces of the great world and master over its seasons." In the decoration of the Ara Pacis, when the Roman world had enjoyed for two decades the blessings of peace, such a thought is no hollow phrase as in the later adulatory panegyrists, who are quoted by Hanf- mann and who repeat the idea ad nauseam. Winter, in a dress known to us especially from representations of Attis, is called simply Attis by most modern scholars, Hanfmann included. The author by no means, however, deceives himself as to the resulting difficulties (I, p. 240). We have no tradition of a relationship of the Phrygian god or his cult to winter. And there are further objections. Of the characteristic attributes of Attis --pedum, tympanon, cymbals, pine branch - not a single one is ever found on the sarcophagi. On the contrary, wherever attributes occur, they are always the same as those which the other personifications of winter, be they female Horai or boyish genii, are given. Moreover, the alleged Attis is completely coordinated with the other three seasons. He dances when they dance (fig. 31), he is winged when they are winged (fig. 2). He should either have been brought into prominence as a god among the seasons, like the centrally placed Bacchus (figs. 28, 36, 38, 44), or else the three others should likewise have been char- acterized as gods. As this, however, is never done, the so-called Attis cannot represent a god either. The dress is limited to Winter. The only exception would be the Spring represented as Attis, on Hanf- mann no. 489. But no. 489 is identical wih no. 486 (cf. Hiilsen, Skizzenbuch des Giovannantonio Dosio, p. 50). The draftsman of the codex Marucellianus in- terpolated the trousers in his very inaccurate rendi- tion, prompted evidently by the damage to the thighs (cf. Hanfmann, fig. 57). Thus only winter is represented in such dress. The right solution had already been divined by Bellori in 1693: the infer- tility of winter is represented "sub Atynis evirati specie." The reviewer had unfortunately overlooked or forgotten this hint of the old antiquarian when he approached the question from another angle. The dress is not limited to Attis. In "Mimus und Logos," Festgabe fiir Carl Niessen (1951), pp. 167 f., parallels are given from New Comedy. A bronze statuette of the Berlin Museum and Chaerea dis- guised as a eunuch in the illustrated codex Parisinus of Terence wear the same peculiarly buttoned trou- sers. With this the idea of Bellori is completely con- firmed and we need no longer impute to the master of the sarcophagus in Dumbarton Oaks a "mis- understanding" (I, p. 240). It is important that thereby also the religio-his- torical, transcendental interpretations of Franz Cumont concerning Attis on sarcophagi and the ancient belief in the hereafter are shown to be un- tenable. It should be stressed that Hanfmann re- ports these speculations with all due respect for their eminent originator, yet with the quiet, objective scepticism that the monuments demand, and does not allow himself to be diverted to these false trails (I, pp. 5, 195; II, p. 69, note 2). The deities connected most frequently with the Horai are, of course, also treated. Here a small addi- tion may be made. The god with the zodiac (I, pp. 177, 221, 227) should perhaps also be recognized in the lost fresco from the Esquilin (S. Reinach, Re'per- toire de Peintures, p. 151, 1), where in the drawing the zodiac seems to have been misunderstood as a fluttering garment. In the treatment of the material the far-reaching work represents something very noteworthy and new of its kind. When almost a hundred years ago Jahn and Matz began to collect the sarcophagi, interest in the history of art was predominant. Echoes were sought of lost Greek painting. When Robert at last published the volumes of the corpus, this kind of criticism had been displaced by the interpretation of subject matter --the research into myths which reached its highest point in Robert's Oidipus. Since Robert's death thirty years ago, interest in the his- tory of art has revived - this time, however, not as a search for lost Greek painting, but as an integra- tion of the monuments in the development of Roman art. We need only mention the work of Rodenwaldt, Giitschow, and Schoenebeck, to say nothing of living scholars. In Hanfmann we find both points of view united in a masterly way. His interpretation covers not only the place of the works in the history of Roman art, but their subject mat- ter as well. We see how much we have learnt in the last generation about the art of the sarcophagi. The conscientious method of the author, however, never leaves us in doubt as to how uncertain much still is. In the collection of material, on the other hand, only new finds could give essential additions. The author was entirely on his own in the far-</page><page sequence="4">1954] BOOK REVIEWS 179 reaching investigation of the ideological background. Since he organizes his material chronologically, and each time treats monuments, cults, literature, and thought separately, overlappings and repetitions in- evitably result. The numbering of the individual monuments and the very detailed indices remedy this to a great extent. A special advantage is the great number of illus- trations of, for the most part, unpublished or in- adequately published objects. Uniform lighting and equal care in taking illustrative copy could not be expected, considering the dispersion of the monu- ments in the most diverse collections. Yet the collo- type plates, as well as the technical execution of all the printing are excellent. It would be petty to list the few misprints. All in all, this is a book borne by its own and new points of view, thorough and solid. It has but one fault: its title. One expects a monograph on a single monument and gets instead a survey of a field in the history of ancient thought, never before so worked on, a book from which every archaeologist, historian of art, student of religion, and philologist can learn abundantly and receive many new inspira- tions.
