If I now ask permission to rectify - or, as the United States Department of State preferred to say, 'to clarify' - one of Sir Anthony's statements I do so only because the responsibility for the necessity of such a rectification rests squarely on my own shoulders. The Stockholm picture, as we now see it, represents the 'second state' of a composition, the 'first state' of which, recoverable with the aid of X-rays, essentially agrees with the well-known drawing preserved in the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge (F. I84). The alterations, probably carried out after an interval of two or three years, amount to a change in subject as well as form, and I attempted to show that this change transforms a favola, viz. Erigone Seduced by Bacchus by Means of a Sham Grape according to Ovid (Met. VI, I25; 'Liber ut Erigonen falsa deceperit uva'), into a poesia, viz. The Glorification of Dramatic Poetry, represented by the encounter of a god who combines the characteristics of Bacchus with those of Apollo (Liber pater, qui et Apollo est) with a maiden who analogously combines the characteristics of a Bacchante with those of a Muse. Sir Anthony accepts the interpretation of the second, or final, state of the Stockholm picture; but he expresses some doubt as to the admittedly recent (I894) interpretation of the first as visibly surviving in the Cambridge drawing: 'I would only venture to express doubt on one point. Though the author rejects the title of Bacchus and Erigone for the finished painting, he believes that it applies to the Cambridge drawing and to the first stage of the painting ... I must confess that I find it difficult to see that this connexion is proved ... As the author admits, certain features, such as the presence of Bacchus in human form, do not conform to the few known renderings of the story. More significant, it seems to me, is the fact that the girl is grasping a thyrsus. In the literary sources she is described as a daughter of a gardener and never as a Bacchante ... Incidentally, the girl does not seem to be looking at the grapes at all but rather to be gazing into space; and their presence could be explained, like that of the wine jar and the goat, on the grounds that they are an obvious attribute of Bacchus.' Of these objections the first seems to be the most cogent. If the grapes were intended only as an attribute of Bacchus it would be difficult to see why they should be so conspicuously placed on a table connected with the heroine rather than the hero; and that the former averts her face from the very object which, were she Erigone, should attract her attention, may be interpreted as a manifestation of Poussin's psychological refinement: in possibly intentional contrast to Guido Reni's Erigone, 'whose avid glances betray her', he may have intended to reveal an inner struggle between amorous fascination and maidenly shyness. And as the first convert to the cult of Bacchus, Erigone would be no less entitled to carry the symbol of her master's power (a power which asserts itself not so much after but in the event depicted) than any other of his votaries, including even his deified consort, Ariadne; see, for example, a silver handle in the British Museum, one of the Campana Plaques in the Louvre and the 'Cameo Carpegna', also in the Louvre (Reinach, Repertoire des reliefs, II, pp.478, 253 and 255, respectively). As regards the presence of Bacchus in human form, however, I had written myself that, 'though not entirely foreign to Seicento literature', it was 'apparently unique with Poussin as far as the visual arts are concerned' (P.35 of the pamphlet just mentioned). This statement, I blush to confess, is as erroneous as the related assertion (p.29) that the earliest recorded illustration of the Erigone story according to Ovid was the picture by Guido Reni. M. Roger-A. d'Hulst (who also kindly provided the photograph reproduced on Fig.32) calls my attention to the fact that this distinction belongs to a Flemish tapestry which I had regrettably overlooked: a member of the series known as Les Mois grotesques, produced some little time before 1574-5 for Charles III, Duke of Lorraine, and (owing to the marriage of his collateral descen- dant, Franz Stephan, to Empress Maria Theresia) now treasured in the Kunsthistorisches Museum at Vienna (R.-A. d'Hulst, La Tapisserie Flamande du XIVe au XViile sidcle, Brussels, I960, pp.240-2, with full bibliography on p.30I f.). Each of these tapestries - allegedly designed by Giulio Romano - shows, in the centre, the god or goddess ruling (according to Manilius) one of the months. Each of these gods or goddesses holds, as an attribute, the Zodiacal Sign of the month in question, and a medallion in the centre of the lower border explains the mythological origin of this Sign. The month of August is thus represented by Ceres, her left hand resting upon the Sign of the Virgin. And since Erigone was one of the three personages believed to have been transformed into this Sign, it is her story which is told in the medallion in the centre of the lower border. It is told, however, according to Ovid rather than according to such astro-mythological sources as Hyginus: Bacchus and Erigone are clasped in a fervent embrace, the latter clutching the fateful grape which is attached to the wreath on the former's head. If there were any doubt about the subject it would be dispelled by the inscription on the medallion's frame which repeats (with two slight variants) the very line which is the only source to describe Erigone and Bacchus as lovers: BACHVS [sic] VT ERIGONEM FICTA [sic] DECEPERIT VVA. Why the designer, in accounting for the mythological ante- cedents of the Sign of the Virgin, should have preferred Erigone to Demeter or Astraea-Dike, and why, if it had to be Erigone, he should have chosen to tell her story not, as Baldassare Peruzzi had done in his Farnesina ceiling, according to the catasterism described by Hyginus, etc, but according to the frivolous tale of Ovid (which should disqualify her for the position of Virgo) is a matter of surmise. He may have made his choice because a love story is always more entertaining than a story of transcendent virtue or filial devotion. But he may have wished, at the same time, to pay a subtle compliment to the art of the tapestry weaver. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, it will be remembered, the Seduction of Erigone is a narrative within a narrative: it is not told as a 'metamorphosis' sui iuris but described as being represented, amidst the love affairs of many other Olympians, in the tapestry produced, in competition with Minerva, by that supremely skill- ful and impudent patron saint of tapestry weaving, Arachne. Certain it is, however, that - contrary to my assumption - the earliest known representation of the Ovidian tale, far from show- ing Erigone alone with the grape, includes the figure of Bacchus in human form. And since another, possibly earlier, set of the Mois grotesques, identical with the Lorraine-Vienna series, was demonstrably available at Paris in the latter half of the seven- teenth century (it is listed in the Mobilier de la Couronne of I66I and was copied in the Manufacture des Gobelins in 1687-8) and may have reached the metropolis at a somewhat earlier date, it is conceivable that the 'anthropomorphic' version of the Erigone scene was known to Poussin even before his departure to Italy.
