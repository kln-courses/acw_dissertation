<plain_text><page sequence="1">Author's Response Speaking of I-Thou relationships with trees, Martin Buber said, "But it can also happen, if will and grace are joined, that as I contemplate the tree I am drawn into a relation, and the tree ceases to be an It." The kind of relationship that Buber envisaged requires a combination of grace and will. If we are to experience the tree as Thou, then we must be able to receive the eloquence of this creature as a gracious gift. But that reception also requires an act of will. Our own volition, our own desire and openness to this relationship, is required if an I-Thou relation is to occur. The two responses to our article demonstrate different degrees of grace and will. Both authors raise important questions. Rensberger's central question is whether we should use anthropomorphisms like "will" at all in describing the responsiveness of trees or other non-sentient creatures. I take his point and think that perhaps we anticipated this question in the article itself. To begin with, the first time that we mention "will" is in the context of describing sym biotic relations between trees and fungus. Reflecting on Lewis Thomas's notion that this kind of symbiosis indicates that "a sort of wish to join up pervades the biosphere," we suggest that such a wish is indicative of responsiveness, perhaps even of will." This is a tentative suggestion. And then at the end of the article we acknowledge that one of the problems with talking of will in relation to trees is that we tend to think of will as requiring the capacity of rational decision-making. Obviously trees do not have such a capacity. But we suggested that this was not as large a stumbling block as may appear because not even human decision-making can exhaustively be understood with refer ence to rationality. Therefore, a lack of rational powers does not necessarily rule out some sort of volition in non-sentient creatures. We must be clear about what we are doing here. We are employing meta phor. That the metaphor is, as Rensberger notes, anthropomorphic, there is no doubt. But I am not so sure that there is any way out of this problem. The question is not "to metaphor or not to metaphor," but "which metaphors are most appropriate to the creature being described?" Perhaps "will," especially if released from its more rationalistic interpretation, can serve us in fostering the kind of I-Thou relationships that Buber envisaged and almost all aborigi nal peoples simply assume. Recognizing that in some sense the tree exercises volition would appear to be necessary if we are to grant the reciprocity that is entailed in any I-Thou relationship. It is on the matter of metaphor that Bedell over-reads us. He says that we "rely entirely upon metaphor to establish what is apparently taken as literally true." Apart from the fact that I am not so sure that there is anything that is "literally true," it is certainly not the case that we use metaphor in the way that Bedell takes exception to. Indeed, immediately after our discussion of metaphor and will on the last page of the article we say that "trees, as trees, in their whole physical, chemical, spatial, biotic functioning" are fully responsive creatures. We do not say that trees also function intellectually, emotionally, socially or 566 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="2">in any of a number of other ways that humans respond. That would be to fall into the trap of literalism that Bedell is so concerned about. It would also be hopelessly anthropocentric. Our point is that in their physical, chemical, spatial and biotic subjectivity trees manifest a behavior that can only be disclosed by means of metaphor. And of course metaphor takes language that is at home in one area of functioning (e.g., human volition) and applies it to another area of functioning (e.g., biological symbiosis). The only interesting question to be asked of this use of metaphor is whether it is appropriate to the creaturely realities one is describing. Bedell complains that we "eschew the need to argue for [our] conclusions." He also says that when we do engage in argument we fall into various "falla cies." While Bedell fails to actually name any of these fallacies and seems to simply dismiss (without argument!) our discussions of symbiosis, adaptability, variability, and life-affirmative behavior in trees, his more serious misunder standing has to do with the relation of prescientifk commitment and scientific conclusion. Do we think that we can scientifically prove the responsiveness of trees in such a way as to legitimate language of I-Thou relationships? No. That goes beyond the legitimate bounds of scientific analysis. Do we think that contemporary research in the scientific discipline of forestry supports such a hypothesis of responsiveness? Yes. But that scientific data (like all data) needs to be interpreted. Symbiosis, adaptability, variability, and life-affirmativeness could be interpreted to suggest volition, intentionality, subjectivity, responsive ness, even selfhood. The same data could also be interpreted to suggest a very different set of metaphors. Intellectual honesty requires that we openly state the perspective with which we will read the data. Such a perspective, we sug gest, is not simply deduced from but is in a dialectical relation to the data. We come to the data with certain prescientific commitments and both read the data in the light of those commitments and reform those commitments in the light of the data. In our article we wanted to be clear with the reader as to the nature of our commitments. Why do we read this data to be suggestive of these metaphors? We list various factors that have formed our commitments, but end with a confession about the biblical witness. As Christians who take the Scrip tures seriously we are predisposed to reading this scientific data in the light of biblical language of creation singing, groaning, praising, vomiting, and danc ing. It is precisely because Rensberger also takes the Scriptures seriously that he is open to our suggestions. Bedell also charges that we fail to give even "modest philosophical support" for our worldview. And the next two paragraphs give us a fairly clear indication of what kind of philosophical support he would like to see, viz., support from the process philosophy of Whitehead and Hartshorne. The details of process philosophy were not in the purview of our article, nor can they sufficiently be addressed in this short response. But it should be noted that our article was informed by the work of Jay McDaniel and John Cobb, both of whom are well known process theologians. And if modest philosophical support is required, 568 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="3">is there something immodest about the writings of Albert Borgmann? How about Martin Buber? Finally, I find it intriguing that both respondents liken our work to the writ ings of different poets. Bedell suggests that Joyce Kilmer said the same thing as our article, only less pretentiously. Rensberger is reminded of Gerard Man ley Hopkins's sense of the "inscape" of created things. The enduring poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins versus the one-hit wonder of Joyce Kilmer. Rensberger hears echoes of Hopkins in our work because both are deeply informed by bib lical language about the responsiveness of creation. The naive romanticism of Kilmer's poem lacks such depth.
