<plain_text><page sequence="1">POLYBIUS' VIEW OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE * Polybius' views on the nature of Roman imperialism have played a large part in recent discussions of the process of Roman expansion during the third and second centuries b.c.1 This is hardly surprising. When an excellent contemporary historian sets out to explain cby what means and under what kind of polity, almost the whole of the inhabited world was conquered and brought under the dominion of the single city of Rome, and that too within a period of not quite 53 years', he is bound to be listened to with respect.2 Yet, while his exposition of the process of imperial expansion has rightly been regarded as central by those debating the question of imperialism,3 Polybius' picture of the end result of that process, of the Roman empire, has attracted less attention. The matter is not without significance for the current debate, for if Polybius' view of the nature of Rome's dominion is sub- stantially different from that of his Roman contemporaries, his analysis of the means and motives which led to that dominion are also likely to be different. Modern writers may still judge that his opinions are the more accurate or the more fruitful, but the gap between the historian and the empire-builders will need examination and explanation. It is fortunate that Polybius as an historian showed that introspective oast of mind which required him to explain at several points the intention and method of his work. At the outset of his Histories in book I; in the early chapters of book III which mark the beginning of his treatment of the core-period of his study from 220 to 167; in his defence of 'universal history' at VIII. 2; and finally in his triumphant conclusion at XXXIX. 8, he reveals a coherent and consistent view of the nature of Roman power. For convenience, I summarise : (a) The Roman arche was world-wide. From his first chapter (I. 1. 5) Polybius is at pains to point out that Rome has become not simply a world-power, but the world- power. It includes 'almost all the inhabited world' (I. 1. 5; I. 2. 7; I. 4. 1 ; XXXIX. 8. 7), otherwise described as 'all the known parts of the inhabited world' (III, 1. 4; VIII. 2. 4), or even 'all the inhabited world' (III. 3. 9; III. 118. 9).

RICHARDSON the totality in geographical terms of Rome's control is not simply a casual obser- vation on Polybius' part, but a central structural point in the writing of his Histories. It is only because Rome's power, going beyond that of Alexander, was so wide-ranging, that knowledge of remote regions of the world was possible (III. 59. 3). More important still, it made 'universal history' essential, since no writer of local history could understand the greatness or the inter-connection of events, nor how Fortune (hi tyche) had brought about the most surprising change of cir- cumstance, that all known parts of the inhabited world had come under one power (tò iTOCVTà Tà yvcopi£ónsva jiépr| Tffe oìkouhevtìs Otto |¿iav ápx^v kccì Suvaareíav ccyayeiv) (VIII. 2. 2-4). (b) The whole world was in the position of a subject. Such a position is almost a natural corollary of (a) . In two places Polybius uses the word hypikoos to describe the status of the world (the oikoumené) under the Roman arche, (I. 2. 7; III. 3. 9). It is not a word commonly used to describe inter-state relationships. Thucydides notoriously employs it to describe the 'subject' as opposed to the autonomous allies of Athens in the fifth century; 4 Polybius himself uses the word to describe satrapies recovered by the Seleucid king Antiochus the Great.5 The Romans, in Polybius' view, exercised a similar sway over the entire world, and the world did what it was told.6 (c) The development of the arche was completed by 167 b.c. Polybius insists on several occasions that the establishment of this world-empire was achieved in a mere 53 years (I. 1. 5; III. 1. 9; III. 4. 2; VI. 2. 3). Once again, this view is not taken at random, but is central to his work. When describing his revised plan in the opening sections of book III, he explains that it would be useful to provide a summary of how, when and why all the known parts of the world fell under Roman dominion, and that this is possible because the process has 'a recognised beginning, a defined duration and an agreed conclusion' (III. 1.5). He makes the position still clearer when explaining why he has decided to continue his narrative to cover the period from 167 down to the destruction of Corinth in 146: by 167, he writes, the expansion and progress of the Roman power had been completed (f| t' au£no"iS K°ù TrpoKOTrfj Tfjs cPco|iaicov Svvccoreias èT£T6ÀEÌcoTo, III. 4. 2), and he emphasises the finality of that completion by the use of the pluperfect tense; the period which followed (i.e. 167-146) is seen not as a further expansion, but as the development of the policy of the conquerors and the reactions of the rest of the world (III. 4. 6). In other words, according to Polybius the domination by Rome and the subjection of the oikoumené was achieved once the Kingdom of Macedón had been destroyed in the settlement following the battle of Pydna. 7 4Thuc.

The question remains of how far this view was held by others than Polybius himself, and, in particular, how far it is representative of the opinions of his Roman contemporaries. There is of course no comparable Roman writer from the second century who provides a coherent account of the empire. For this reason, to obtain a clearer com- parison I propose to examine briefly the opinions of two individuals, writing within the century and a half following Polybius: Cicero and the emperor Augustus.8 The danger of so anachronistic a procedure is patent, but some patterns emerge in their view of the empire which seem to have their source in a much earlier period. (a) Extent of the empire: Two contrasting positions emerge: the first that the empire and the world are co-extensive, and that this has been so at least since the early part of the first century b.c.; the second that the empire in the late republic and the early years of the principate not only could be expanded, but was expanded by the campaigns and settlements of such men as Sulla, Pompey, Caesar and Augustus. Cicero at various times holds both these views. In various highly rhetorical passages he equates 'the boundaries of the imperium of the Roman people' with the limits of the world (e.g. Balb. 5. 13; Mil. 35. 98), and in two passages, which are by no means rhetorical, he describes this as the state of affairs in the late second century. In the introductory opening to his dialogue de oratore, he explains that once the 'empire over all nations' had been established,9 a long period of peace encouraged young men to study oratory, especially under the influence of the Greeks {de or. 1. 4. 14). It is clear that he is explaining to his brother Quintus the background to the group of orators, including L. Crassus, Q,. Mucius Scaevola and M. Antonius, who came to prominence in the last two decades of the second century. Again, in a fragment of the de república (dramatic date 129 b.c.), he makes one of his speakers refer to 'this nation of ours ... in whose imperium the whole world is now contained'.10 On the other hand, there are passages in which Cicero appears to have quite a different view, particularly when he is talking of the achievements of Caesar and Pompey. Thus in 56 b.c. he can look back to Pompey's campaigns in the East, and observe that Pompey has removed the threat to the eastern provinces, so that Asia 'which previously used to be the frontier of our imperium' is now ringed by three new provinces.11 Elsewhere he makes it clear that both Pompey and Caesar have 8As will be clear, I am indebted in this section to the work of P. A. Brunt, esp. in JRS liii (1963) 170-6, and in Imperialism in the Ancient World (ed. Garnsey and Whittaker) (Cambridge 1978), 159-91. Though wishing to suggest an emphasis not present in his account, I have found Brunt's correction of earlier and over-simplified versions of Roman attitudes both stimulating and almost entirely convincing. 'postea quam imperio omnium gentium constituto diurmtas pacis otium connrmavit . . . (de or. 1.4. 14). 10noster hie populus, quern Africanus hesterno sermone a stirpe repetivit, cuius imperio ìam orbis terrae tenetur (de rep. 3. 15. 24).

RICHARDSON extended the empire to the boundaries of the world.12 As might be expected, Augustus' pronouncements, especially in his account of his Res Gestae, follow this line. The very title placed at the beginning of the inscription, that this is a record of the 'actions by which he subjected the world to the imperium of the Roman people' shows him laying claim to the tradition of those who under the republic had extended the boundaries of empire.13 He records not only that, for instance, he had brought the peoples of Pannonia under the sway of the Roman imperium, and enlarged the boundaries of Illyricum, but that he had added Egypt also.14 Of these two views, the first is clearly nearer to that of Polybius, though it has the character more of eulogy than analysis, more laus imperii than historia. The second, however, is quite incompatible with Polybius. This emerges particularly strongly in the cases of Pompey and Augustus. There can be no doubt that such areas as Bithynia and Syria, which Pompey is represented as adding to the empire, were within Polybius' concept of the known world, and thus, according to his view, within the Roman arche by 167. Similarly it would be interesting to know Polybius' reaction to Augustus' claim that 'Aegyptum imperio populi Roman adieci'.15 (b) 'Provinciae' : A second element among the imperial concepts of both Cicero and Augustus is that the core of the empire, and sometimes even its totality, is composed of the provinciae. Augustus begins his account of his expansion of the empire after the end of the civil wars with the words 'omnium provine [iarum populi Romani], quibus finitimae fuerunt gentes quae n[on parerent imperio nos] tro, fines auxi' (R.G. 26). Suetonius expounds Augustus' benificence towards allied kings by ex- plaining that he treated them with a consideration no different from that shown to integral parts of the empire.16 These passages give a picture of the Roman empire consisting of 'provinciae populi Romani', to which Augustus' kindliness allowed the addition of the client kings. It need hardly be said that this picture, which can be traced in Cicero as well as, for instance, Strabo,17 is essentially different from that of Polybius, whose 'inhabited world', subject to the Roman arche, was largely inhabited by Hellenistic kings. 12On Pompey: in Cat. III. 11. 26; pro Sest. 31. 67; pro Balb. 5. 13. On Caesar: de prov. cons. 13. 33; pro Balb. 28. 64. Compare Pompey's claim, on an inscription recorded by Diodoros 'kocì to ópíce ttís T)ye|iovías Toís ópots Tfis yfjs TTpoapipáaas' (Diod. Sic. XL. 4). 13Rerum gestarum, quibus orbem terra[rum] imperio populi Rom[ani] subiecit (R. G. praef.).

XL. 4, Augustus R.G. 27. 16reges socios . . . nee aliter universos quam membra partisque imperii curae habuit (Suet. Aug. 48). Brunt (in Imperialism in the Ancient World, 169) argues from this passage that * Augustus was to regard all reges socios as membra partisque imperii9. However Suetonius appears to be saying that Augustus knew they were different from the membra partisque, but decided to treat them as if they were not. 17Thus Cic. de imp. Cn. Pomp. 17. 53, where a threat to the empire is represented in terms of a threat to the provinciae; as also at de prov. cons. 12. 31 and Phil. 7. 5. 15.

The usual Greek word for provincia, eparchia, was already being used both by Romans writing to Greeks and among the Greeks themselves in official documents of the period within which Polybius was writing.18 He himself uses the term seven times.19 Four times he is referring to Carthaginian and Syracusan territory in Sicily; 20 two others occur in his record of the agreement between the Carthaginians and the Romans in 241 that neither should interfere in territory under the other's control; 21 and one describes the events in 290 whereby the marauding Gauls retreated from the 'Roman area' of Italy.22 None of these instances relate to a provincia, that is to an area of responsibility within which a Roman magistrate or pro-magistrate might exercise his imperituri.2* More remarkable even than his use of the word eparchia in these contexts, is his failure to use it at all, so far as we are able to tell from the substantial fragments surviving, in the rest of his Histories, although they include an account of Roman expansion down to 146, and, in book VI, an analysis of the machinery of the Roman state. The absence in Polybius of any Roman concept oí provincia can be seen clearly in his description of the events in the senate in 197. The discussion of the allocation of provinces, and in particular whether Flamininus was to be replaced in Macedonia, is recorded both by Polybius (XVIII. 11) and Livy (XXXII. 28), in a passage which is certainly drawn from annalistic sources.24 Even here, Polybius makes no mention oí provinciae, and when, for instance, Livy concludes his discussion 'patres ambobus consulibus Italiani provinciam decreverunt' (XXXII. 28. 8), Polybius states that the senate 'sent both consuls to Gaul'.25 In some ways, of course, the difference between the two sources is not great, and Polybius might be excused the niceties of Roman constitutional terminology on the grounds that here, as in book VI, he is interested in the actual operation of the state and the spheres of operation of its different parts, rather than in how this might be described by the Romans; 26 but this attitude of Polybius, and his consequent obscuring of the precise relation- ship between magistrate and senate reveals a different view of the empire and of the provinciae from that of Livy's Roman source. Livy's phraseology presupposes a system whereby the consuls, holding the imperium as a result of their election by the 18On eparchia, see H. J. Mason, Greek terms for Roman institutions {American Studies in Papyrology 13, Toronto 1974) 135 if. The word is found, meaning a provincia, in the letter of a Roman magistrate to the guilds of Dionysiac artists, from the latter half of the second century, (Sherk, Roman Docu- ments no. 44 1.2); and in the Milesian arbitration between the Lacedaemonians and the Messenians c. 140 (,S7G3683, 11. 63-5). 19References from A.

RICHARDSON people, were assigned areas {provinciae) by the senate in which they might exercise that imperium; Polybius sees the senate controlling foreign policy and sending out its executive officers, rather as a Seleucid monarch might send out his satraps. Some modern scholars indeed have argued that Polybius should have been well able to understand the nature of the Roman empire, because of his acquain- tance with the institutions of the Hellenistic kingdoms.27 This overlooks the fact that Rome was not a Hellenistic kingdom but, in effect, a constitutional oligarchy. For the men who determined Roman policy their most regular encounter with foreign and imperial affairs must have been the annual allocation of provinciae in the senate with the discussions attending it, and their own involvement in a pro- vincia as a result of such allocations. Such men could scarely avoid being aware of the relationship oí provincia and imperium, in all its senses, and to that extent must have had a view of the empire different from that of Polybius. At the least they would have found it hard to accept, as Polybius suggests, that there was no basic alteration in the Roman arche between 167 and 146, a period which saw the addition of two areas, Africa and Macedonia, to the list of those regularly assigned as provinciae. It should be noted that the difference between Polybius5 view and that which characterised Roman action in the Hellenistic world of the second century is not essentially about the amount or even the extent of Roman control. Rather it is a matter of the concepts used to describe their power. The stories on which Polybius lays such weight, of Roman magistrates and ambassadors issuing peremptory orders to Greeks, of Acilius Glabrio shackling the Aetolian leaders in 191 (XX. 9-10), of Q. Metellus making demands of the Achaeans unwarranted by senatorial decree in 185 (XXII. 10), and, most remarkably of all, of C. Popilius Laenas' high-handed treatment of Antiochus IV outside Alexandria in 168 (XXIX. 27), all illustrate that the consciousness of Roman military might was an integral part of Rome's dealings with the leagues and kingdoms of the Hellenistic world. This is certainly part of what Polybius means when he describes the world as 'hypekoos' to the Romans (above pp. 2 ff.). The period down to 168 saw Romans and Italians under arms in vast numbers, and although the numbers fell after the war against Perseus, it can be argued that until the mid-century, when Macedonia in addition to the two Spanish provinces required a regular garrison, large resources of men combined with only one standing overseas commitment (the two legions in Spain) made Roman power potentially more formidable than it was to be for the next hundred years or so.28 The fact that both Polybius and his Roman contemporaries were agreed that Rome was powerful and could make others obey her does not, however, show that their views on the nature of Roman power were identical, but merely that they over- lap. The Romans inevitably saw power in terms oí imperium wielded by a magistrate, and the provincia within which he used that imperium was also naturally part of their understanding. These are bases on which the distinctively Roman conception of their empire, seen in the latter years of the republic and the early years of the empire, was built. Polybius lacks these concepts, or at least does not exhibit them in his work. 27So H. Bengtson, Mus. Helv. x (1953) 165, followed by Musti, 59-60. 28See P. A. Brunt, Italian Manpower 225 B.C.-A.D. 14 (Oxford 1971), 416-34.</page><page sequence="7">POLYBIUS' VIEW OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 7 III The difference between Polybius' picture and the Roman one is not purely negative. Although Polybius does not employ the language of magistracy and province to analyse the Roman empire, he does use other terminology, which reveals a set of ideas about Rome which he seems to have in common with his Greek contem- poraries, but not with the Romans. Polybius' own account of events in the Greek states immediately before and following the war against Perseus shows clearly that a substantial number of Greek statesmen already held the view that Rome was the chief world-power before the defeat of Perseus and the settlement of Macedonia in 167, and that after that date this was the fundamental fact of Greek political life. Those who were openly and avowedly Romanizers, such as Kallikrates of Leontion, were of course consistent in urging that the prime and even sole duty of the Greeks was to do precisely what the Romans told them to do, and nothing else. In other words, they were to be 'subject' (kypikoos) ,29 Events in Greece immediately after 167 proved that such men existed throughout the mainland.30 But it is clear from Polybius' discussion of the differing views of Greek politicians on the destruction of Carthage in the famous passage in book XXXVI. 9 that those unsympathetic towards the Romans also saw them as holding world domination.31 It is, however, on the nature of the Roman regime rather than on the fact of its existence that Polybius' view seems to depart from that of his Roman contemporaries, and it is here too that the evidence from the Greek cities clearly supports and illumi- nates Polybius. The most striking and widespread Greek reaction was the establish- ment, especially in Asia Minor, of the cult of the goddess Roma.32 Already before Pydna Roma was worshipped at Smyrna, Chalkis, Libyra in Phrygia, and Alabanda, and games celebrated in her honour by the Lycian League.33 After 167 the number of cases increases enormously.34 The significance of this development is manifold, and still awaits thorough investigation, but for the purpose of the present argument certain common features are of importance. In particular, it is evident that the detailed form of the cult of Roma was modelled on the divine honours given to Hellenistic monarchs. 2 «Kallikrates: Polybius XXIV. 9; XXIX. 23. 10-11; XXXIII. 16. 7.

RICHARDSON Although personification was a natural form of abstraction in Greek thought,35 and although such anthropomorphic entities as the people {dèmos) of Athens or of Rome already existed, the personified divinity of a city did not appear until the late third and early second century b.c. The earliest was probably Rhodes, followed quickly by, if not contemporaneous with, the cult of Roma.36 The latter, however, seems to have acquired her cult, cultic epithets, games and honours not on the model of the nymph Rhodos, but directly from the Hellenistic kings, whose place in the power-structure of the Greek world the Romans had taken.37 Both inscriptional evidence and literary works give Roma all the trappings of a king.38 It was perhaps inevitable that such a transfer should take place with the rise of Rome to rank alongside and eventually to overshadow the monarchies that dominated the eastern Mediterranean, and there is considerable evidence to confirm this development, even outside the area of cultic observances. Kineas, the ambassador of Pyrrhus of Epirus to the senate in 280, is said to have observed that the senate was 'an assembly of kings', and the author of / Maccabees reports that they were the equals of kings, though claiming no personal greatness.39 Prusias' address to the senate as 'saviour gods' when congratulating the Romans on their success against Perseus is another, if exaggerated and, to Polybius' mind, distasteful example of the same attitude.40 It is clear that the end of the Macedonian monarchy at the death of Perseus gave rise to philosophical reflection on the nature of kingship and on the transfer of power to the Romans, which linked Rome and the monarchy. Polybius quotes the remarks of Demetrius of Phaleron on the mutability of fortune, that if 50 years before the generation of Alexander some god had told the Persians or their king, or the Macedonians or their king, about what was to happen, they would have disbelieved it; and that it might be that fortune (tychi), who was bound by no agreements so far as our lives were concerned, would take away from the Macedonians the prosperity which she had given them from the Persians.41 Polybius sees the fulfillment of this prediction in the fall of the Macedonian king, Perseus, just as Demetrius' original observation had related to the Persian and Macedonian kings. Similarly Plutarch cites Karneades, a contemporary of Polybius, who, in a discussion of attitudes of mind to changes of circumstance, contrasted Perseus, who having lost Macedonia lamented his fate and was generally regarded as the most unfortunate of men, with Aemilius Paullus, his conqueror, who freely handed over command to his successor, performing his triumphal sacrifice and receiving a crown.42 These instances show both a parallelism between the Macedonian monarchy and the Roman predominance 35T.

The same position is found among the views which Polybius records as current in Greece after the suppression of the uprising of the pseudo-Philip in Macedonia and the final sack of Carthage by Scipio Aemili- anus in 146. Some felt, according to Polybius, that usually the Romans behaved well, especially in war, but in the case of Carthage had acted rather with the in- trigue of a monarch than in accord with the principles of a civilised city like Rome.43 Here again, in an unfavourable context, is both the parallel with the action of a monarchic ruler, and the awareness that, despite the similarity, Rome is in fact a city-state. A similar ambiguity can be seen in Polybius. It is explicit in the account he gives of the Roman constitution in book VI as a combination of aristocratic, democratic and monarchic elements.44 The 'kingship' view is apparent again in his discussion of treachery, which begins with the case of Aristainos, who had persuaded the Achaean league to abandon its alliance with Philip of Macedón and to join the Roman side in 198.45 Polybius introduces the matter with remarks about those who make compacts with certain kings and dynasts,46 and emphasises the view by drawing a comparison with Demosthenes' refusal to make an alliance with Philip II. It is evident that here Rome is once again being thought of as the equivalent of an Hellenistic basileus.*7 Another indication of Polybius' classification of Rome with the kings, along with the awareness of a distinction between the two, is the language he uses to describe the Roman empire. The word dynasteia is used 25 times to describe Roman rule ; although he uses the same word on seven occasions when talking of Carthage, the predominant employment of the term is in royal contexts (some 38 in all). It is striking that he does not use the word at all to describe the power of a Greek city or league, with the exception of two passages, both of which refer to Sparta's domination of Greece after the King's Peace of 486.48 His use of arche is even more significant. Apart from its use to mean 'beginning', two basic senses of the word can be distinguished: 49 it can be used for a magistracy or an elected or appointed office; or a kingdom, empire or rule. Of the first meaning, there are 80 examples in the surviving fragments, 36 of which refer to Rome, but only one to an official in the employment of a king.50. The remainder are all officers of 'constitutional' states. The second meaning oí arche (i.e. a kingdom, empire or rule) occurs 133 times. Of these, 20 refer to Rome, one to Carthaginian domination in Spain, and the remaining 111 all to monarchies. This confirms the picture we have already seen: Polybius 43Polybius XXXVI. 9. 1 1 : toüto 8è liovccpxiKfjs -rrpccynocTOTroitocs oíkeíov eívai liáAAov f| TToAiTtKfjs Korì TcoiAoüKfís aípécrecos- See for the translation Walbank, Commentary on Polybius III, 666-7. 44Polvbius VI. 11. 11-13. 45Polvbius XVIII. 13-5: on the context, see Walbank, Commentary on Polybius II, 564-5. 46Polvbius XVIII. 13. 4: 47See the discussion of Musti, (op. cit. in n. 1), 70-2. 48Passages cited by Mauersberger, Polybios-Lexicon I. 2. 580 ff.

RICHARDSON knows that Rome is a 'constitutional' state, as are the Aetolian or Achaean Leagues ; but also sees her as a dominating 'monarchical' force on the model of the Hellenistic kings. In this last, his thinking is very much of a piece with those of his contem- poraries who drew on the cults of the Hellenistic kings to establish the worship of the goddess Roma. IV Polybius, in common with many of his Greek contemporaries, thought of Rome in terms which would usually be applied to a king, Two further observations should be made at this point. Firstly, within its own terms, this view of Rome has much to commend it, and is not merely a naive transfer of terminology from one type of ruling power to another, for which it is quite unsuitable. Polybius reports that Aratos of Sikyon formulated his policy towards Antigonos Doson in the knowledge that kings had no natural friends or enemies but always reckon friendship and enmity in terms of expediency. The phrase is very like that applied by Thucydides to a tyrant or a city possessing empire (irpòs emorcc 8è 8eì f| è\Qpòv f\ cpiAov \itra KaipoO yiyveaOai).51 Given the record of Roman policy after 167 as presented by Polybius, it applies to Rome with remarkable aptitude.52 The title of king was often justified, especially in the period immediately after the death of Alexander, by the claim to command large forces and to have won territory by conquest.53 Here again, the parallel with Rome is clear. However, and this is the second point, although Polybius' view of the Roman empire has much to commend it, we must realise that it was not a Roman view. The goddess Roma was never, in this period, honoured in Rome, and indeed the only known references even to a personification of the city there are in dedications made by Greek states.54 The contrast is brought out clearly in the regulations for the publication of the treaties between Rome on the one hand and Cibyra and Astypalaea respectively on the other, both of which specify that the inscriptions should be put in the temple of Juppiter Capitolinus in Rome, and on a golden statue (Cibyra) or an altar (Astypalaea) of the goddess Roma in the Greek states.55 51Polybius II. 47. 5; Thuc.

These, as has been shown, are absent from Polybius. Along with Roman religion, such elements of the Roman state seem to have been misunder- stood or even perhaps ignored by Polybius and other Greek writers.57 If this is true it follows that the long debate about the nature and accuracy of Polybius' opinion of Roman imperialism has too often overlooked the fact that his picture of the empire that they eventually achieved is essentially non-Roman.
