Everywhere in this arid upland the very landscape itself reflects the subtle and powerful qualities of its magic. High, dry plains where swaying sunflowers are mistaken for walking men. Vast deserts burning under a brassy sun. Plateaus slashed with gulch and arroyo, and lifting like altars flat- topped mesas blood-red against the sky. And in the distance smoke-blue moun- tains floating on the horizon. Always it has been a country where everything is enlarged and distorted; where the illusory effects of light and distance work per- petual fantasies with the land. This is a wide country. With its vast dimensions of space and time, its fan- tastically eroded shapes, its shifting colors, it is bounded only by the imagina- tion. Little wonder that from time im- memorial men here have found in magic their most valid terms of appeal. Who or what these first men were, or where they came from, we still do not know. Out from the unrecorded prehis- toric past they came filing into the open plaza. Out from the sacred kivas, them- selves symbolical of the dark womblike underworld from which man first emerged into self-conscious existence, they came filing to the low beat of a drum. Men naked and painted, wearing the feathers of their wild nobility. Men dancing to the primal forces of earth and sky. For gentle rain, for growing corn. Invoking with prayerful rhythm the magic of pure feeling, the intuitional ap- perception of their solidarity with all the living universe. And all around them as they danced the walls rose higher. The massive ter- raced walls of Pueblo Bonito,. Chetro- Ketl and Pueblo del Arroyo; of Aztec and Pecos and Puye; of Zuñi and Taos. Great walled cities more compact than those of China. Ancient city-states that rival those of Greece. The first cities of America, and perhaps the greatest com- munal dwellings known. Centuries be- fore Columbus came they stood here on the sunlit plains, beside the slow red rivers, atop the lofty mesas. Cities built on the old magic of New Mexico; on the magic of ancient man's direct relation- ship to the ultimate source of all power. It must have been wonderful, really. These great swarming pueblos rising, tier on tier, in the wilderness hinterland 231</page><page sequence="2">232 SOUTHWEST REVIEW of an unknown continent. These ancient peoples with their instinctual and intui- tional, rather than mechanistic and ra- tional, approach to life. And powerful too. For the first white newcomers, the Spaniards from the south, made little headway against this old magic with their swords and crosses, their rosaries and lances. The Indians kept on dancing. The creed of the cross did not change the people, even in three cen- turies. It only changed the face of the land. Then suddenly and swiftly a new in- flux of strangers changed it still more. They came from the east. With axes and long-barreled rifles. In rumbling Cones- togas. With still another ideology: the concept of a wild and virgin continent waiting only to be gutted of its riches. It was no longer a living motherland. It was but an inexhaustible reservoir of profitable natural resources. Quickly it was done. In a scant cen- tury they had sunk in the land the foun- dations of the greatest materialistic- mechanistic civilization ever known. On it they had raised the highest triumphal towers ever built by man. But still withstanding the press of steel and concrete the old magic persisted here in New Mexico. Beyond Cochiti the drums still beat and the rain clouds gathered. In the deep winter dusk of Zuñi the giant anthropomorphic Shalako glided over the causeway to bring assur- ance that the old gods of earth and sky endured. On the snowy roof-tops of Taos the Cacique still watched the stars for his people. The dusty plazas of Santo Domingo, of San Ildefonso, of Santa Clara resounded to the thud of stamping moccasins, to the beating drums and soughing chants of a people who still be- lieved in their brotherhood with the breathing mountains, the living stone. How charming it was to view them on a summer vacation! So simple and naïve, so paganistic and animalistic, so impos- sible . . . really! This handful of a race vanishing on a shrinking reservation; a political, economic and social minority of 1 per cent of the national population. With a magic long outmoded and made ridiculous by bathtubs and canned peas, Ford tractors, and the miracles of radio, airplane and sound-movies. But still to many of us something was lacking. The quick of life was gone, the sense of mystery, the nobleness of simple endeavor. The universe was a well-oiled machine. Nature was composed of po- tentialities for hydroelectric power, building materials and irrigation projects. Man was merely a social entity, a psychi- atric case, a slave to the great machine. The divine right of kings had given way to the domination of the church militant, and it to the power of the almighty dol- lar. There was no magic left in the world. Man's machine had enslaved man. How ghastly! How horrible! How could man escape the deadening con- striction of life in the machine-age? Why, go back to the old magic, said D. H. Lawrence. Back to the instinctual, intuitive. Back to the deep, dark wisdom of the blood. So here in the hinterland of New Mex- ico, on the high pine slope of Lobo Moun- tain, Lawrence began his fight to re- awaken in man the joy and quick of life, a sense of the old magic- He worked on his ranch. He milked his cow. He baked his own bread. And sit- ting under a pine, writing in that neat calligraphy his neighbors know so well, he gave us some of the most vivid pictures</page><page sequence="3">THE MAGIC THAT PERSISTS 233 ever written of that dark realm of the blood. Back to it! Back with The Woman Who Kode Away . Back into Mornings in Mexico. Back to The Plumed Serpent . He was a wonderful artist, one of the best this land has known. But he had reached the last oubliette; and he was writing the obituary of his own mis- guided faith. The Plumed Serpent is one of his littlest known and greatest books. It is a strange novel. And one of the most horrible prophecies ever written. The scene is Mexico, mostly on the shore of Lake Chapala. But really, inside, it springs from New Mexico like The Woman Who Kode Away. The dark, somber, serape-clad Indios have the same magic of the Red Indians of the North. The drumbeats echo the rhythm of pueblo drums. And the stark fear of white superiority, of the gringo indus- trialism sweeping the country, is Lawrence's own hate of American mechanization. Pues. He starts an ideological revolu- tion in Mexico. That is, the main char- acters do. Don Ramon, a handsome, in- telligent Mexican graduated from Col- umbia University. And Cipriano, a small, bandy-legged Indian, an army officer. They will overthrow the corrupt gov- ernment, kick out the greedy gringo, nullify the dominating power of the Catholic Church, and combat the stulti- fying rationalization and mechanization of life. And what, asks Kate, an American visitor, the omnipresent doubter, shall take their place? Why, the people shall go back to the old magic. To the instinctual, intuitional way of life. To their ancient Aztec gods. So from the muddy bottom of Lake Chapala old idols appear. Leaflets circu- late in the villages, imprinted with the Hymns of Quetzalcoatl, the Eternal Snake of the Cosmos, the feathered-ser- pent god of Aztec Mexico. In the plazas at night people begin to gather. To talk. To dance softly, with measured tread . . . the old Round Dance of the Indians of the North, as danced in the pueblo of Taos. Swiftly momentum gathers. Don Ramon submerges his identity in the First Man of Quetzalcoatl. His insignia of the new order is a blue and white serape containing the snake and eagle symbol of the Aztec empire. Cipriano in his red serape is the First Man of Huitzilo- pochtli, the Aztec god of war and death. He begins forming his legions of the Men of Quetzalcoatl, teaching them to dance with knife and spear and shield. Dancing to gain power, "power over the living forces or potencies of the earth." And Kate, the omnipresent doubter, she too cannot resist the old magic. She becomes the First Woman of Itzpapalotl, the obsidian butterfly god of the Aztecs. It is done! The Catholic Church is con- demned, the Archbishop is deported. The government is overthrown. The armies of Huitzilopochtli swarm over the coun- try. The banners of Quetzalcoatl rise tri- umphant over a people who have obliter- ated four hundred years of progress. Says Lawrence, through Don Ramon: So if I want Mexicans to learn the name of Quetzalcoatl, it is because I want them to speak with the tongues of their own blood. I wish the Teutonic world would once more think in terms of Thor and Wotan, and the tree Igdrasil . . . And a New Hermes should come back to the Mediterranean, and a new Ashtaroth to Tunis; and Mithras again to Persia . . .</page><page sequence="4">234 SOUTHWEST REVIEW Yes. The Plumed Serpent is a literary tour de force. A fictional wish-fulfill- ment. And a ghastly prophecy. Published in 1926, it came true in 1933. But not in Mexico. In that year Don Ramon, alias Adolf Hitler, came very much to life. Proclaim- ing himself Chancellor of the Third Reich, he shouted stridently to the world that Germany once more would indeed think in terms of Thor and Wotan and the tree Igdrasil. The world saw what happened. On the same pattern prescribed in T he Plumed Serpent. But with the accent on the blood-feeling of the Aryan instead of the Indian. The symbol of the swastika instead of the feathered serpent. Back to the dark, instinctual realm of the blood! Back to the purifying force of pure feeling! "Strength Through Joy." Up from the past the whole pantheon of ancient Germanic gods, to the tune of Wagner's Ring . Out with the Christian Church. Down with foreigners, death to Jews. Lebensraum . Geopolitik. Heil , my Fuehrer! As a pattern for one of the greatest holocausts in history The Plumed Ser- pent has no parallel. Indeed, on close reading it might well seem more Hitler's original blueprint than Mein Kampf . World War II. The German Götter- dämmerung. And a dazed world crawl- ing out of another blood-bath. All to prove, perhaps, that no people can go back to the old magic of their ancient pasts. Always the pendulum of cyclic change swings back and forth be- tween the two opposite poles of man's dual nature: the instinctual or intui- tional, and the rational. But the spiral of growth is upward. Man cannot rest on the long upward path of his continuous evolution. He cannot go back; he dare not give up an inch of the ground he has gained through millennia of cease- less struggle. Even here, on a high pine slope, in magical New Mexico. For the magic of life is everywhere and enduring, if only we can see its new forms and read its new meanings. Espe- cially here in magical New Mexico. At Alamogordo, on July 16, 1945, the new magic first took shape. A towering cloud: golden, purple, violet, gray and blue in color; umbrella shaped at the top. Followed by a searing light that illumi- nated every peak and ridge of the near- by mountain range. And then by an ex- plosion of indescribable intensity. This wa s the shape of the world's new magic. The explosion of the world's first atomic bomb. What was its meaning? Bushy-haired Albert Einstein had ex- plained it long before with a statement of five symbols . . . the most significant statement made by modern man. E = mc2 And what, wondered the world, did that mean? Why simply, said Einstein, that energy is equivalent to mass multiplied by the square of the velocity of light. In short, matter is merely another form of energy. Forty years later the world awoke to the practical application of its meaning. With the discovery of protons, electrons and photons; the splitting of the atom; the explosion of the first atomic bomb - after this, it knew that every pound of any kind of matter contained as much energy as is given off by the explosion of fourteen million tons of TNT. This, we know now, is the practical application of its meaning. Its meaning still eludes us. And in that meaning is New Mexico's and the world' s new magic.</page><page sequence="5">THE MAGIC THAT PERSISTS 235 Matter is equivalent to energy. Matter does not exist only as such; it is merely another form of energy. This is our new magic - the transformation of matter into energy. Is it, after all, so different from the old magic? The old, old magic of New Mexico: when men, naked and painted, came filing out from the sacred kivas to dance for rain and corn; to invoke with beating drum and thudding moccasins the primal forces of earth and sky; to transform their energy into matter. Nayenezgani, the Man-Who-Killed- Fear, is the great war god of the Navajos. Born of Estsanatlehi, the Earth-mother, and Tso-hanval, the Sun-father, he is not a destructive god of war, but a slayer of monsters and of fear itself. Related to all the good forces of nature as he is, he con- verts even the destructive power of light- ning to beneficent purposes. Nayenez- gani, known as the Transformer. We too now have such gods, the great Transformers. High up on The Hill, in the mountains above the old pueblo of Jemez, at the Los Alamos atomic research laboratory. At Alamogordo. At the Ord- nance Proving Grounds at White Sands, where on December 17, 1946, a V-2 rocket was sent soaring to a new world's altitude record of 1 1 3 miles. It is not strange that here in New Mexico, side by side with the remnants of the oldest magic that still persists in America, they are making the world's new magic. The new magic which is so much like the old. The new magic which also must give man "power over the living forces or potencies of the earth"; which must learn to transform matter into energy for the good of man; and which must, above all, destroy fear - the fear of destructive evil, of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This is our destiny; the irrevocable law of constant evolution to which we are committed. There is no going back to Quetzalcoatl, to Thor and Wotan, even to Nayenezgani. There is no going back to the dark instinctual realm of the blood. We are mystics with slide-rules, priests of atomic fission. And through the rationalistic-mechanistic civilization of our era we must fight our way upward to a new conception of our enduring soli- darity with all the living universe. Only the names for it change. The magic still persists. The old magic and the new magic of magical New Mexico.</page></plain_text>
