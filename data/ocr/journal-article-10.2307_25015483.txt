<plain_text><page sequence="1">MEDIAEVAL HUMANISM* By Martin R. P. McGuire Definition had a central place in mediaeval discussion. At the out set, therefore, I shall attempt to define humanism, or rather the senses in which I propose to use the term, for it is now employed to describe various movements and attitudes which are in part dia metrically opposed. It is especially necessary for me to define terms, because the combination of words in the title of my discussion involves something of a paradox. The early Humanists created the derogatory term, mediaeval, to designate the period from the close of antiquity to their own times as a dark and culturally inferior age. Accordingly, we would seem to be seeking evidences of a movement or attitude which was regarded by its own creators and exponents as the repudia tion of all that they embodied in the concept mediaeval. I shall employ the term humanism without qualification ordinarily but not exclusively in its older sense, i.e., as the study of the classics of Greece and Rome and the impulse given by that study to the development of a comprehensive cultural ideal, of a basic philosophy of life. All recent forms of humanism have their ultimate foundation in the older concept or attitude. I shall t regard modern humanism in gen eral, to quote one of the standard definitions of the phenomenon, as "a system, mode, or attitude of thought or action centering upon dis tinctly human interests and ideals, especially as contrasted with naturalistic or religious interests."1 Finally, I should like to dis claim any predilection for the term, mediaeval humanism. I much prefer to speak of Christian humanism, i.e., basically a theocentric * This essay, with some minor changes, was presented as a paper at the joint session of the American Historical and American Catholic Historical Associa tions, in New York on December 30, 1951. The general theme of the joint session was mediaeval humanism and modern humanism, the main papers being delivered by Professor Crane Brinton of Harvard University and the writer of this essay. The nature and purpose of the session explains the rather broad and general character of the present article. Mr. McGuire is head of the Department of Greek and Latin in the Catholic University of America. 1 This definition is taken from Webster's New International Dictionary, 2nd ed., s.v. "humanism," 3.

The term and concept, Christian humanism, focuses attention also on origins. Mediaeval humanism and Renaissance humanism, to say nothing of modern humanism, would hardly be conceivable unless Christianity, in spite of its bitter physical and spiritual conflicts with Greco-Roman paganism, had found an important place in its own system for pagan literature and learning long before the Middle Ages began. Christianity inaugurated a revolution in the Greco-Roman world which was not confined to the spiritual sphere but ultimately affected all phases of life and action. From the beginning, especially from the commencement of its mission to the Gentiles, the new religion had to make ever closer contact with Greek and Greco-Roman culture. It is extremely important to remember that Christianity's sacred books were in Greek. The inherited Septuagint Version became its Greek Old Testament, and this served as the basis for all Latin translations of Old Testament books until the new version made from the Hebrew by St. Jerome. The New Testament, with the exception of the Gospel of St. Matthew in its earliest form, was written in Greek. St. Paul preached in Greek at Athens itself, and his conciliatory address to the philosophers in the Areopagus, pointing the way to a union of Greek culture with Christianity, may be re garded as a landmark in the rise of Christian humanism. St. Paul's address, however, received a cold reception from the group as a whole, and Christianity was destined to win adherents from the intellectual elite very slowly. Hence, in reaction against the contemporary pagan morality and superstition, and smarting under the scornful attacks of pagan in tellectuals and persecution by the State, some Christians like Tertullian and Tatian raised the cry, "What has Athens to do with Jerusalem ?" They advocated a break with pagan culture, although even Tertullian himself grudgingly modified his own extreme views in the light of practical needs. But the majority of the ecclesiastical writers and fathers in the Greek East and Latin West accepted the pagan culture in a number of essential features, justifying their position on grounds of theory as well as of practical necessity. The story of the relations between Christianity and pagan literature, learning, and education has been told in greater or less detail in recent years, especially by</page><page sequence="3">MARTIN R. P. McGUIRE 399 De Labriolle, Marrou, Courcelle, Ellspermann, and Laistner.2 A few points, however, must be discussed here, as they have such a direct bearing on the rise of Christian humanism in Antiquity and on its con tinuance and development in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. The central question is this : how did Christianity justify in theory its employment and assimilation of pagan literature and learning? Origen and Clement of Alexandria had dealt with this problem, for they were really the first to make wide and systematic use of pagan cultural achievements in the service of the new faith. But the problem received its classic solution in St. Jerome, St. Augustine, and St. Basil, and one which is cited again and again from their own times to the nineteenth century in the controversies over the place of the pagan classics in education. The following passage from St. Augus tine's De doctrina Christiana?and five centuries later it was incorpo rated without acknowledgment by Hrabanus Maurus into his De institutione clericorum?sums up the Christian position : Furthermore, if those who are called philosophers, especially the Plato nists, have said things by chance that are truthful and conformable to our faith, we must not only have no fear of them, but even appropriate them for our own use from those who are, in a sense, their illegal possessors. The Egyptians not only had idols and crushing burdens which the people of Israel detested and from which they fled, but they also had vessels and ornaments of gold and silver, and clothing, which the Israelites, leaving Egypt secretly, claimed for themselves as if for a better use. Not on their own authority did they make this appropriation, but by the command of God, while the Egyptians themselves, without realizing it, were supplying the things which they were not using properly. In the same way, all the teachings of the pagans have counterfeit and super stitious notions and oppressive burdens of useless labor, which anyone 2 Cf. P.

However, they also contain liberal instruction more adapted to the service of truth and also very useful principles about morals; even some truths about the service of the one God Himself are discovered among them. These are, in a sense, their gold and silver. They themselves did not create them, but excavated them, as it were, from the mines of divine Providence, which is everywhere present, but they wickedly and unjustly misuse this treasure for the service of demons. When the Christian severs himself in spirit from the wretched association of these men, he ought to take it from them for the lawful service of preaching the Gospel. It is also right for us to receive and possess their clothing in order to convert it to a Christian use, i.e., those human insti tutions suited for intercourse with men and which we cannot do without in this life. For, what else have many noble and loyal members of our faith done? Do we not perceive with what an abundance of gold, silver and clothing that very eloquent teacher and blessed martyr, Cyprian, was loaded when he left Egypt? With what an abundance Lactantius was enriched, and Victorinus, Optatus, Hilary, and innumerable Greeks, not to speak of men who are still living ? That most obedient servant of God, Moses him self, was the first to do this, and it was written of him that he "was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians." The superstitious pagans, especially at that time when, striking at the yoke of Christ, they were persecuting the Christians, would never have bestowed upon all these men sciences which they themselves considered profitable, if they had supposed that they were going to convert them to the worship of the one God, in order that the false worship of idols might be rooted out. But they gave their gold, silver, and garments to the people of God who were leaving Egypt, not knowing how the things which they were giving would yield to "the obedience of Christ." What happened in the Exodus is un doubtedly a figure that signified the present. I assert this without preju dice to another interpretation, either equal or better.3 All that is considered good in pagan education, literature, phi losophy, medicine, and other branches of learning, then, is to be traced ultimately to divine Providence. This good is to be separated from the false and to be appropriated by Christians as rightful pos 3 St. Augustine, De doctrina Christiana, 2.40.60. With minor changes, I have employed the recent translation of John J. Gavigan, O.S.A., in Writings of St. Augustine [Volume 4, The Fathers of the Church. A New Translation] (New York, 1947), pp. 112-114. For the use of this passage in Hrabanus Maurus, cf. his De institutione clericorum, 3.26 (Migne, PL, 107, cols. 404A 405A).</page><page sequence="5">MARTIN R. P. McGUIRE 401 sessors or heirs to the service of Christian truth. The example of Moses?and that of Daniel is frequently added?gives scriptural sup port to the attitude described. The Christian view of pagan learning as a rightful inheritance was based also on the widespread belief among the Hellenistic Jews, and one which later became a common place in Christian apologetic, that the more significant teachings of Plato and other Greek philosophers on the virtues, e.g., were borrowed from the Bible itself! It should be noted too that St. Augustine elsewhere in his works, especially in the De civitate Dei, adopts a similar attitude toward pagan social and political institutions. The most important practical application of the Christian theory was, of course, in the field of education. Although the schools of rhetoric were thoroughly pagan in spirit and in the content of their curriculum, and remained so pretty much for that matter to the end of Antiquity, they were attended by Christians even in the fourth and fifth centuries when an ever increasing number of students came from Christian homes. The dangers of such a pagan environment to Christian youth explain the constant warnings and criticisms re specting the pagan schools found throughout ancient Greek and Latin Christian literature. But the training received in these schools also did much to acquaint Christian writers with the intellectual achieve ments of pagan culture and to form their literary style in the best traditions of their age. Growing out of the vigorous seed planted by Clement and Origen, Christian humanism burst into full flower in the fourth and fifth centuries, the golden age of patristic literature in East and West. Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory of Nyssa, Basil the Great, John Chry sostom, Hilary, Ambrose, Jerome, Rufinus, Paulinus of Nola, Pru dentius, and Augustine of Hippo towering over all the rest, were older or younger contemporaries. Their voluminous works are largely theological, or at least deal with religious themes, but they reveal an intimate acquaintance with and a wide employment of pagan litera ture and learning from the classical periods of Greece and Rome to their own times. Furthermore, thoroughly trained as they were in the pagan rhetorical schools, all, with the possible exception of Rufinus, were masters of style. They really loved the great works of classical literature and they adapted numerous pagan literary genres to Christian use. We still sometimes fail to realize?although this was fully appreciated by Erasmus and other eminent humanists</page><page sequence="6">402 MEDIAEVAL HUMANISM of the Renaissance?that many of the works of the great fathers of the Church are as distinguished for their style as for their content, and belong to the masterpieces of literature as well as of theology. The De civitate Dei and the Confessions of Augustine, the Letters of Jerome, and, above all, the Latin Vulgate, have a high place in any list of the world's literary classics. St. Hilary gives us the essence of this Christian humanism in the beautiful prayer found in his De trinitate: "Grant us precision in language, light of understand ing, grace of style, and loyalty to truth" (1.38). The Christian assimilation of pagan cultural elements was not confined to rhetoric and literature, but also embraced philosophy. The Stoic ethics of Cicero and Seneca are given a Christianized form in the De officiis of St. Ambrose, and most of the great fathers of the Church are Christian Platonists or Christian Neoplatonists. Gregory of Nyssa's dialogue De anima is a classic example of patristic Platon ism. Gregory Nazianzen and his contemporaries reflect the assimila tion of Greek philosophy and its ideals by their use of the verb philosophein in the sense of "live according to the Christian ideal," and the noun philosophia in the sense of "Christian contemplation and its practice." The fusion of pagan and Christian thought in Antiquity culminates in Boethius and Pseudo-Dionysius. The importance of patristic humanism in the history of humanism can hardly be exaggerated. Through the greatness and authority of its representatives and their works it set a basic pattern for the future. Moreover, through its theocentric character, and its emphasis on literature and learning in the service of religion, it furnished the strongest stimulation and need for its own preservation and continued development. It must also be emphasized that patristic humanism coincided with?or perhaps better?constituted the most significant phase in the revival of Greek and Roman literature and scholarship in the fourth and fifth centuries. Werner Jaeger has well said: "There are still people who do not realize that what we had in both hemispheres of the late Roman empire at that time was one of the most creative civilizations which history has ever seen. The synthesis of Christian religion and classical Greek and Roman culture which it effected became classical in its turn for the following centuries of the Middle Ages, and for countless millions of people it still is."4 4 Cf. Werner Jaeger, Humanism and Theology [The Aquinas Lecture, Mar quette University] (Milwaukee, 1943), p. 24.</page><page sequence="7">MARTIN R. P. McGUIRE 403 The subsequent history of this synthesis in Byzantium must be omitted here. However, it should be noted that the Byzantine renais sance of the ninth century, the age of Photius, played the same impor tant role as the Carolingian Renaissance in the preservation and study of ancient authors, pagan and Christian, and thus laid the foundations for the Greek learning of the later Middle Ages and for the possibility of its transmission to the West. From the beginning of the Middle Ages in the West, the synthesis was already long completed. In fact, it had become a tradition, as is so clearly evident in Cassiodorus and Isidore. That the tradition did not die, or at least suffer far greater damages than it did, in the sixth, seventh, and early eighth centuries, is largely to be explained by the fact that the Church in the West, having once adopted Latin as the language of her liturgy, theology, and ecclesiastical administra tion, persisted in maintaining it. Hence, in spite of all obstacles, Latin had to be taught and studied with primarily practical ends in mind. Owing to the strong authority of the Western Church and to the circumstance that she was the sole source and vehicle of higher culture for so long in Italy, Gaul, Spain, Ireland, and Britain, as later in Germany, Bohemia, Scandinavia, and Poland, all these re gions, while developing many local variations in liturgy, especially in the earlier period, used Latin as their ecclesiastical language. The possible rise of a liturgy in Gothic or Old High German vanished with the triumph of orthodoxy over Arianism. Under the influence of the patristic synthesis the pagan as well as the Christian classics found, sooner or later, a place in the curriculum of the monastic and cathedral schools. The peoples outside Romania, beginning with the Irish and the Anglo-Saxons, adopted the early mediaeval school cur riculum with special enthusiasm. Moreover, they approached the pagan classics without too many of the inhibitions which troubled the minds of those in the direct Latin tradition. Mediaeval humanism, then, is based on the patristic tradition, but that does not mean that it is absolutely uniform in scope, emphases, or intensity. The numerous recent articles and books dealing with renaissances in the Middle Ages?one among them quite newly dis covered5?are very valuable in that, while recognizing a basic simi 5 Cf. R. S.

A number of recent articles and books on the Italian Renaissance have likewise contributed to a much better understanding not only of that complex movement but also to a better understanding of mediaeval culture as a whole and of its continued life and influence, in many important respects, during the period of the Renaissance and after.6 It would not be possible here, nor is it necessary, to trace in detail the development of mediaeval humanism, whether that movement be regarded in the narrower or broader sense of the term. But a few general observations will be in order before passing to a consideration of the harmony between faith and reason which was finally established in the thirteenth century against the background of patristic and earlier mediaeval traditions and of Aristotelian philosophy. The story of the preservation of the classics in the Middle Ages and of the extent to which they were copied, read, or neglected century by century is now well known in its main outlines and to an increasing degree in detail. The school tradition of which they formed such an essential part beside Christian works is also becoming much better known, and especially in those periods which, like the tenth century, were once regarded as wholly dark. In spite of the pardonable pride reflected in the enthusiastic words of the Chronicler of St. Gall in which he states that Alcuin's "teaching wras so fruit ful that the Gauls and Franks of our time (moderni) have become the peers of the ancient Romans and Athenians,"7 the school cur riculum of the Carolingians was largely confined in practice to gram ography cited: E. M. Sanford, "The Twelfth Century?Renaissance or Proto Renaissance," Speculum, XXIV (1951), 635-642, and U. T. Holmes, Jr., "The Idea of a Twelfth-Century Renaissance," ibid., 643-651. 6 I should like in particular to call attention to the outstanding study of P. O. Kristeller, "Humanism and Scholasticism in the Italian Renaissance," Bysan tion, XVII (1944-1945), 346-374, republished with revisions under the title "Umanesimo e scolastica nel Renascimento italiano," Humanitas, V (1950). 7 The Latin reads : In tantum fructificavit ut moderni Galli sive Franci anti quis Romanis et Atheniensibus aequarentur.

Dialectic and the subjects of the quadrivium only came fully into their own in the tenth and eleventh centuries, with Gerbert of Aurillac, and with the struggle over investitures. The political, social, economic, and intellectual world of Alcuin was relatively primitive as compared with that of John of Salisbury in the twelfth century with its fully developed feudal system encompassing Church and State, its town life, its guilds, its fruitful contacts with Islamic learning, its revival of Roman law, and its rising universities.8 Building on the work of the Carolingians, the schools of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries, especially the cathedral schools, forged Latin into a wonderfully flexible instrument of literary and philosophi cal expression in which classical, Christian, and mediaeval elements were freely blended. St. Anselm of Canterbury, St. Peter Dami?n, St. Bernard of Clairvaux, John of Salisbury, and Otto of Freising wrote Latin not only with clearness and correctness, but also with the force and warmth of style which is associated with mastery of a living language and all its potentialities. But it is in poetry that mediaeval Latin reached its zenith in literary form: in men like Hildebert of Lavardin, a Christian humanist in the spirit of the Renaissance, in the chief Goliards, and in the great religious poets and their achievements, beginning with the sequences of Adam of St. Victor and culminating in the Pange Lingua of St. Thomas Aquinas, the Stabat Mater of Jaco pone da Todi, and the Dies Irae of Thomas of Celano. The production of a great universal literature in Latin was accom panied, furthermore, by a related development?from the earlier Middle Ages in the Celtic and Germanic North and from the eleventh century in the Romance lands?of a great literature in the vernacular. The emphasis on Latin in church and school perhaps retarded a more rapid development of the vernacular literatures, particularly in the Romance lands. But these literatures only received written form through the Latin school tradition, and vernacular writers profited enormously through the literary forms and rich content of ancient pagan and Christian literature made available to them. The Latin inheritance from Antiquity and the whole literary and scholarly pro duction of the mediaeval period itself in Latin, the common universal language, became the common heritage of the great vernacular litera 8 Cf., e.g., the recent monograph of H. Liebesch?tz, Mediaeval Humanism in the Life and Writings of John of Salisbury (London, 1950).</page><page sequence="10">406 MEDIAEVAL HUMANISM tures of Europe and gave them the common tradition and basic rela tionship which is such a vital and significant factor in the subsequent history of western civilization. The almost overwhelming impact of Aristotle and his Islamic and Jewish commentators on the universities in the thirteenth century is still generally presented as the chief cause for the decline of mediaeval humanism on the Latin literary side. But the causes for this decline were really much deeper and were already operating in the twelfth century itself, the golden age of mediaeval Latin literature. Preoccupation with Aristotle in the universities, to the subordination of the arts and their cultivation, and the adoption of a bald scientific style of Latin exposition, undoubtedly hastened the eclipse of Latin as a vital medium of literary or creative composition. Yet it should be remembered that the rapid development, in the twelfth century, of the ars dictaminis, the ars praedicandi, and the ars versificatoria, combined with a heavy emphasis on logical theory and practice, pre pared the way for the neglect of the auctores in the thirteenth. More over, in spite of its great flexibility and rich resources of expression when thoroughly mastered, mediaeval Latin still remained a foreign tongue, and it was inevitable that the vernaculars would assert them selves as literary media, especially with the ever increasing partici pation of the laity in education and literary composition. The Latin school tradition, as indicated above, furnished a most effective appren ticeship for vernacular writers and actually hastened the process of their training and emancipation. Secular Latin poetry was in full decline before the end of the twelfth century. As Raby puts it : "The truth is that Latin secular poetry had no longer any real excuse for existing. The lyrical part of it was fed, on the whole, from vernacular sources, and both in execution and in range of expression, the ver nacular had now an unchallenged superiority."9 Religious Latin poetry, it is true, flourished during most of the thirteenth century, but it is significant that no really great Latin hymns were written after the Fange Lingua, Dies Irae, and Stabat Mater. John of Gar land, the contemporary of St. Thomas Aquinas, and vehement cham pion of the arts, bemoans the neglect of classical authors. But his highly artificial style, his deliberate obscurity, and his constant parade 9 Cf. F. J. E. Raby, A History of Secular Latin Poetry in the Middle Ages, 2 vols. (Oxford, 1934), II, 341.</page><page sequence="11">MARTIN R. P. McGUIRE 407 of pedantry, all indicate a marked decline from the representatives of the arts a century earlier. It is not too surprising, under the circumstances, that Dante, who was intimately familiar with the Latin tradition and learning of the schools, possessed a good knowledge of the auctores, and was a master of Latin style, as his Latin treatises and letters bear wit ness, should decide to compose his literary works, above all, the Divine Comedy, in his Florentine vernacular, and that, thus, the greatest, most mature, and most characteristic literary achievement of the Christian humanism of the Middle Ages should be a poem written, not in Latin, but in Italian. Dante's judgment was sounder and his choice of language happier than that of his younger contempo rary Petrarch, who was confident that his Latin epic Africa would be his chief claim to lasting glory. The Divine Comedy, however, should not be too exclusively viewed as a product of mediaeval humanism on the literary side. On the con trary, it is more typically mediaeval in its emphasis on philosophical and theological problems, on reason and Revelation, on man and human nature not merely in themselves but in relation to God their Creator and Preserver. Moderns in general prefer the Inferno to the Purgatorio and Paradiso, but for Dante the Paradiso was by far the most significant part of his poem. We must consider finally, there fore, the all-important question already mentioned earlier, namely, the role of philosophy and theology in mediaeval humanism. The assimilation of late Hellenic philosophy and its utilization in the elaboration of Christian theology is, as we have already noted, one of the most important and influential features of patristic human ism. It should be emphasized that by far the most important school of late Hellenic philosophy was Neoplatonism, a theocentric system of thought essentially religious in character. The Christian Platonism or rather Neoplatonism of the fathers of the Church, especially as rep resented and developed by the greatest of Latin thinkers, St. Au gustine of Hippo, combined with the Aristotelianism of Boethius, constituted the foundation of mediaeval thought. The Augustinian influence was preponderant, and thought long remained primarily theological. With Abelard and Hugh of St. Victor, we enter a new age in mediaeval thought. Abelard applied his powerful dialectic to the ology, and, in spite of his condemnation on the charge of holding</page><page sequence="12">408 MEDIAEVAL HUMANISM extreme views, dialectic henceforth was to play an important and fruitful role in theological speculation and systematization. Hugh of St. Victor, under the influence of Aristotle through Boethius and through the Aristotelian works becoming available in his own time, attempted in his Didascalicon to give a comprehensive classification of all branches of knowledge, their objects, and relationships. The essence of his Christian humanism is contained in statements like the following : "The highest consolation in life, therefore, is the pur suit of wisdom, and he who finds it is happy and he who possesses it is blest" (1.1) ; "The perfection of human life is accomplished by two things, knowledge and virtue, and in this perfection is contained our sole likeness to the heavenly and divine substances" (1.5) ; "Therefore never consider any knowledge worthless, for all knowl edge is good" (3.13); "Learn everything; you will see later that nothing is superfluous" (6.3).10 By insisting on the sharp distinction between knowledge based on experience and knowledge based on faith, yet fully recognizing the necessity of faith, he contributed very much to the development of natural theology. The translations of many works of Aristotle, and especially that of the Metaphysics, hitherto unknown to the Latin West, opened up a new intellectual world, and all but overwhelmed the traditional medi aeval thought in the last part of the twelfth and early thirteenth cen turies. The older translations from the Arabic with their many distor tions of Aristotelian thought and the pantheistic tendencies of the Islamic commentators only helped to intensify the crisis. Under the 10 The Latin original reads : Summum igitur in vita solamen est Studium sapientiae, quam qui invenit felix est, et qui possidet beatus (1.1) ; Integritas vitae humanae duobus perficitur, scientia et virtute, quae nobis cum supernis et divinis substantiis similitudo sola est (1.5) ; Nullam denique scientiam vilem teneas, quia omnis scientia bona est (3.13) ; Omnia disce, videbis postea nihil esse superfluum (6.3). For the Latin text, cf. Hugonis de Sane to Victore Didas calicon de studio legendi, edited by Brother Charles Henry Buttimer, F.S.C. [The Catholic University of America Studies in Medieval and Renaissance Latin, Volume X] (Washington, 1939). E. R. Curtius, in his Europ?ische Literatur und lateinisches Mittelalter (Bern, 1948), pp. 475-476, recognizes the importance of Hugh of St. Victor as a systematizer of knowledge, but he classifies him among the anti-humanists because of his attitude towards literature. Such a judgment is made according to the norms of traditional classical humanism. From the viewpoint of philosophical and theological humanism, however, Hugh of St. Victor should really be regarded as one of the great pioneers in Christian humanism.</page><page sequence="13">MARTIN R. P. McGUIRE 409 circumstances, the ecclesiastical censures affecting Aristotelian works in 1210 and 1231 are understandable. But the cloud over Aristotle soon lifted. It was the great achievement of St. Albertus Magnus and, espe cially, of St. Thomas Aquinas, to perceive the tremendous worth and potentialities of the new Aristotle, to interpret him more accurately and critically through the use of new translations made directly from the Greek, and on the basis of the knowledge and vision thus acquired to create a magnificent synthesis of Christian thought in which the ology itself was enriched and systematized, and philosophy proper was given its own place of honor and its own autonomy. In this elaboration of philosophy, natural theology, the science of God based on reason as distinct from Revelation, has a central place and gives ultimate meaning to man and his role in the universe. In making man theocentric on the basis of the evidence furnished by natural reason alone, while at the same time fully recognizing man's own nature and its potentialities, St. Thomas, as Jaeger acutely demon strates in his Humanism and Theology, is in the best tradition of Greek theological humanism, that of Plato and Aristotle, as distinct from the anthropomorphic humanism of the ancient Sophists and their successors.11 The synthesis of St. Thomas gives full recognition to both philosophy and theology. Their spheres of thought are clearly established, and their harmony is at once the most characteristic and crowning achievement of the Thomistic synthesis. Modern Christian humanism is simply a later phase of the same basic outlook contained in the Thomistic synthesis. It is intensely devoted to the cultivation of all the higher aspirations of man, it recog nizes and defends the sacredness and dignity of human personality, and it insists on absolute moral and intellectual values in the natural order. At the same time, it is theocentric in its outlook, it regards man and his role in the universe not merely in relation to his fellows alone, but evaluates man, his nature, potentialities, and achievements, in relation to a personal God and His divine dispensation.
