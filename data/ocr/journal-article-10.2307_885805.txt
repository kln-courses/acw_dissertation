<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXHIBITION REVIEWS Vienna and Kassel Tschechische Moderne On emerging from the Kiinstlerhaus in Vienna, the first of two venues for a bold exposition of the 'modern' sensibility in Czech art of the period 1890-1918,' one could not help but feel a measure of admiration on at least two counts. Firstly, that Tomal V1kek and his colleagues from Prague had felt sufficient confidence in the eloquence of the display itself - of some 220 deftly integrated paintings, sculp- tures and works on paper - to dispense with a more explicitly didactic presentation. Secondly, that in accepting the invitation to comment on a national tradition, they had so consistently refrained from the 'cul- tural patriotism' which still characterises many such ventures. (Though the criterion for inclusion is principally ethnic rather than geographic - much is made of the achievement of that extraterritorial fig- ure, Franti'ek Kupka - this account of the tschechische Moderne puts its principal stress on the noun.) Both aspects of the exhibition - which will be shown at the Fridericianum, Kassel, from 5th December to 20th Feb- ruary - also give some cause for concern. It would be foolhardy to assume that a wider audience for this subject does not still have to be won; and it seems unrealistic to ex- pect those unfamiliar with the issues to respond appropriately to the selection and its arrangement without any further guidance. In Vienna no information was provided in wall panels or extended cap- tions, while the catalogue essays - with the exception of Bydiovska on aspects of art life in Prague and Wittlich on a Czech tra- dition of 'lyricism' - are too dazzlingly al- lusive to serve as an effective introduction. Nor are the exhibited items sufficiently representative as a group to function, alternatively, as a general survey of Czech art like that attempted in the much larger Darmstadt show of the mid-1980s.2 The re- luctance to think in terms of distinguishing 'national virtues', meanwhile, is matched by a reluctance to invoke pertinent com- parative examples from other national traditions within Austria-Hungary, an exercise that would, in part, have lent sup- port to V1kek's central thesis. This is signalled in the exhibition's ex- planatory, but also provocative, subtitle, where the dates 1890-1918 accommodate more than one meaning of the slippery term Moderne. Vklek argues that an en- during 'modern' sensibility (characterised by an unfailing inventiveness in response to a perceived 'era of crisis') constituted an important form of continuity in Czech art through three enormously eventful decades. Most crucially, he insists that the achieve- ments of the 1890s and earlier 1900s, al- though rejected by leading figures in the generation that followed, established the necessary intellectual and aesthetic con- ditions for the remarkable advances made by that generation. While this is by no means the first time that such an argu- ment has been advanced, the exhibition in Vienna and Kassel is the first attempt to illustrate it in such a form. At the Kiinstler- haus, moreover, the case for continuity was not only presented: it was also severely tested. Like all the larger shows mounted there, the Czech exhibition was split be- tween a lower and an upper floor, the over- all arrangement thus paradoxically pre- serving the received notion of a definitive caesura within the period. Tschechische Moderne, in the now inter- nationally familiar sense of the Czech component of Early Modernism, c.1907- 18, was to be found upstairs, with a room containing ten paintings by Kupka and two larger spaces exhilaratingly cram- med with works by Emil Filla, Antonin Prochazka, Bohumil Kubista, Otto Gut- freund (Fig. 77) ,JosefVachal, Jan Zrzavy, Josef Capek and others. Tschechische Mod- erne as the artistic equivalent of the new literary sensibility acclaimed in a manifesto of 1895 was displayed both more spaciously and more dramatically in the nine vari- ously sized rooms of the ground floor. These contained works dating from the early 1890s to about 1910 by artists gener- ally less well known outside the Czech Republic: the sculpture of Josef Vaclav Myslbek and some of his pupils (Mafatka, Stursa, Sucharda), and that of his great antagonist Frantisek Bilek (Fig.76), also strikingly represented here by works on paper; the paintings of Antonin Slavikek, Antonin Hudetek and Jan Preisler (Fig. 74); and the prints, drawings and water- colours of Franti'ek Kobliha and Vojtech Preissig (Fig.75). Most of the items displayed were loaned by the Narodni Galerie and other collec- tions in Prague, and many were familiar from earlier exhibitions and publications; but their presentation at the Kiinstlerhaus was exemplary in the insights and revisions it prompted, at least for those who came prepared. Evidence of a distinctively 'mod- ern' sensibility was plentiful and varied. Several exquisitely coloured pictures from the Black Lake cycle of 1903-05 (Fig.74) amply demonstrated the success of Jan Preisler (1872-1918) in transforming the strong Czech tradition of decorative alle- gorical painting in order to address the existential dilemmas implicit in both set- tings and narratives. Among the minimally anthropomorphic,, yet invariably touch- ing, forms ofJosef Capek (1887-1945), the angular, spot-lit figure in Terror of 1915 hinted at the artist's strong interest in the Expressionist potential of the cinematic image. The rather more intractable case for continuity was made in several, quite differ- ent ways. The work of Kupka (1871-1957) and Preissig (1873-1944), rightly present in both sections of the show, offered com- pelling evidence of swift and unbroken de- velopment throughout the period covered. The combination of traditional motif and startlingly innovatory technique in Preissig's print of 1908, Forest under snow (Fig.75), is a characteristic result of the radical re- working of themes and forms of the 1890s 74. 74.

Secondly, there were instances of younger artists expressly returning to the preoccupations or style of the older figures they had come to regard as 'pioneers'. Franti'ek Kobliha, Josef Vaichal and other members of the Neo-Symbolist group Sursum drew particu- lar inspiration from the mystically tinged mood of oppression or yearning and the strain of primitivism in the idiosyncratic work of Frantisek Bilek (1872-1941; Fig.76). Thirdly, and perhaps most interestingly, one became aware of less specific forms of continuity modifying some of the strongest outside influences on Czech art. This was of most significance in the case of leading exponents of Czech Cubism, notably Otto Gutfreund (1889-1927). In the relief of 1912-13 (Fig.77), both Cubist analysis and Futurist dynamism are subservient to a deep spiritual investment in the figure, of a kind encountered repeatedly in the strong sculptural component in the show. While more likely to intrigue than to en- lighten the general public, this exhibition does add a new dimension to scholarly debate on the Czech contribution to Early Modernism. It may also prove of lasting consequence in Prague (especially if given a final showing there) through its influence on the installation of the city's long-awaited gallery of twentieth-century art.3 ELIZABETH CLEGG I Vergangene Zukunft: Tschechische Moderne 1890-1918 was at the Kiinstlerhaus, Vienna from 10th Sep- tember to 2nd November, and will be shown at the Fridericianum, Kassel from 5th December to 20th February.
