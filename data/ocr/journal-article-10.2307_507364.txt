<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology in Jordan STEPHEN H. SAVAGE, KURT A. ZAMORA, AND DONALD R. KELLER The 2000 edition of the "Archaeology in Jordan" newsletter again presents brief reports on recent excavations and archaeological projects in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (fig. 1). General projects and surveys are presented first, followed by excavation reports organized chronologically. In both sections, reports are presented in approximate north-south order. This year's newsletter bids farewell to Virginia Egan, who provided technical editing for five years, and to Patricia Bikai, who spearheaded the efforts to create the newsletter and edited reports for technical content for the six years since the inception of the series. The new editors would like to thank them for their work in establishing the high standards for the "Archaeology in Jor- dan" newsletter, and we wish them continued suc- cess. We also would like to thank the Department of Antiquities of Jordan, its director, Dr. Fawwaz Al-Khraysheh, and his staff for their continued efforts and support on behalf of all those who are interested in the cultural heritage of Jordan. Publication of this year's "Archaeology inJordan" newsletter was once again made possible in part by contributions from theJordan Society and the Amer- ican Center of Oriental Research. GENERAL PROJECTS AND SURVEYS Archaeological Sites Online. Stephen H. Savage (shsavage@asu.edu), Arizona State University, re- ports: The Jordan Antiquities Database and Informa- tion System (JADIS) archaeological site inventory is now available as a series of interactive maps on the Internet.' From the site's home page, select the "Jordan GIS" button on the left side of the screen. A general page that explains how the maps are or- ganized and navigated is displayed; buttons on the left side load the maps by time period. Sites are organized into 10 periods: Paleolithic, Neolithic, Chalcolithic, Early Bronze Age, Middle and Late Bronze Age, Iron Age, Early Classical (Hellenistic and Nabatean), Late Classical (Roman and Byzan- tine), Early Islamic (Umayyad through Mameluk), and Late Islamic (Ottoman through modern). The maps allow panning and four zoom levels. The JADIS site number is displayed when the cur- sor rests on a site, and a table of site information is displayed when the user clicks on a site. Site loca- tions are not included. Reported site data include the subperiods represented at the site, presence or absence of flints, ceramics, structures and in- scriptions (where appropriate), and site size, ele- vation, topographic zone, and site name. The sys- tem supports display of site pictures in 320 x 240 jpg format, one per site for each major time peri- od represented, but so far only a few sites include images. Wadi Ziqlab Survey. Lisa Maher (lisamaherl@- yahoo.com) and E.B. Banning, University of Toron- to, report: In 2000, the Wadi Ziqlab Project conducted a geomorphological and archaeological survey with the goal of reconstructing the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene paleolandscape, as well as relating the accompanying river valley changes to the distri- butions of sites of Epipaleolithic, Neolithic, and Chalcolithic periods. The survey discovered 18 pre- viously undocumented sites ranging in age from the Middle Paleolithic to the Iron Age. Of particu- lar note was the discovery of three Epipaleolithic sites only a few kilometers from each other. The survey also documented the alluvial and colluvial histories and the prehistoric topographies associ- ated with these sites. Sample trenches were excavated in the river ter- races to test for potential prehistoric occupation, and the survey also examined the terraces and col- luvial slopes, their stratification in exposed cross- sections, and their associated artifacts, as well as changes in watercourse and the location of springs. Samples were collected on- and off-site for bulk sediment, micromorphological, microartifact, and phytolith analysis. Severe downcutting has incised portions of the old wadi floor, leaving terraces stranded well above the current channel. In other areas, cycles of ero- sion and deposition have either buried sites under many meters of colluvium or removed any evidence of occupation. A carbonate-rich red deposit was as- 'Savage (2001, 16 March) provides access to the maps and additional information onJordanian archaeology. 427 American Journal of Archaeology 105 (2001) 427-61</page><page sequence="2">STEPHEN H.

Examples of retouched bladelets from the Geometric Kebaran site WZ 148, Wadi Ziqlab Survey sociated in some locations with typologically dis- tinct Geometric Kebaran (ca. 14,000-12,500 B.P.) lithics. The location of this distinctive deposit was traced throughout the wadi and sampled at each location. The details reported here involve our pre- liminary field observations of some of the sites and their associated deposits. The survey discovered three previously unknown sites of the Epipaleolithic period. In combination with the previously excavated Epipaleolithic mate- rial from Tabaqat al-Bfma (WZ 200), the inventory now includes four such sites in Wadi Ziqlab. Each contains dense concentrations of diagnostic mi- croliths, including many examples of rectangular and trapezoidal backed bladelets. Sites WZ 136 and WZ 138 are adjacent ancient river terraces separated by a small gully at the east end of the modern Ziqlab reservoir. The exposed sections of each terrace clearly show sequential deposits of alluvial gravels overlain by colluvial ma- terial. The lithic artifacts are eroding out of the side of the terrace from a heavily carbonate-con- creted sediment just below the most recent colluvi- um. The WZ 136 material is clearly Epipaleolithic, with numerous bladelet cores, unretouched and backed blades and bladelets, scrapers, rectangles, and trapezes. WZ 138 contains Epipaleolithic ma- terial in smaller quantities. WZ 148 is a Geometric Kebaran site exposed in the sections of a remnant alluvial terrace bulldozed by modern road construction. It is near the spring 'Uyyun al-Hammam and less than 800 m from Tabaqat al-Bfma, a Geometric Kebaran and Late Neolithic site excavated in 1990-1992. Examina- tion of the sections on both sides of the road dem- onstrates various episodes of wadi channel depos- it. Artifacts were collected from the exposed road cut, on the surface across the road from the cut, and the exposed section left by wadi downcutting. Two 1 x 1.5 m soundings were excavated to obtain a stratified sample of artifacts and sediments. Nota- ble are the high proportion of rectangles, trapezes, and backed bladelets, and the presence of small scrapers (fig. 2). Three pieces of finely ground ba- salt were found eroding out of the section, includ- ing a complete pestle. The Epipaleolithic component at Tabaqat al- Bfima and recent survey results allow us to investi- gate the Epipaleolithic landscape, as well as to ex- amine variability between Geometric Kebaran sites within a single drainage system. Khanasiri Regional Survey. Karin Bartl and Ricar- do Eichmann, German Archaeological Institute, and Fawwaz Al-Khraysheh, DAJ, report: Tell Khanasiri, located between Irbid and Ma- fraq, is one of the most prominent archaeological sites in northern Jordan. The site and its surround- ing area are the subjects of a joint project, entitled Palaeoenvironmental and Archaeological Studies in the Khanasiri Region and codirected by the German Archaeological Institute and the Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology of Yarmouk Uni- versity, that began in April 1999. The project focus- es on two research objectives: the definition of struc- ture and function of Tell Khanasiri and systematic archaeological surface investigations of the sur- rounding area. During the survey fieldwork, an area of nearly 100 km2 was investigated. The entire collection of sur- face material consists of about ca. 2,500 pot sherds and ca. 6,900 lithic tools, cores, and flakes. The pre- liminary analysis of the surface material indicates two main phases of interest: the Paleolithic periods and the time since the Late Iron Age when the area was settled permanently. According to the prelimi- nary analysis, most of the flint material can be dated to the Middle and Upper Paleolithic periods and later. The most frequent material is from the Leval- lois/Mousterian period. The Upper Paleolithic material shows less specific tools. Tools of the late Lower Paleolithic were rare. Surprisingly little evi- dence of the Epipaleolithic period was found. Al- though the presence of very small flakes and tools I _ I 429 2001] N 7- -, .- - 1 - ~~~~~~~~~ I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~' e 4sm~ -d=2t</page><page sequence="4">STEPHEN H. SAVAGE ET AL. on several hills and terraces point to the existence of younger prehistoric periods, it seems that only very few Epipaleolithic sites exist in the area. Early Neolithic sites are rare as well. Only a few PPNB sites were found, all situated on top of small hillsides. Almost no finds or settlement remains point to a permanent occupation of the area in the periods after the PPNB. Late Neolithic, Chalcolithic, and Bronze Age sites are completely missing. It is only in the Late Iron Age, during the mid sixth century, that permanent settlements appear. All of the larger villages in the area, such as Khana- siri, Fa', and Burayqa, seem to have been founded during that period. Settlement activities are docu- mented by pottery finds from the Late Iron Age to the Hellenistic, Roman/Late Roman-Early Byzan- tine, and Islamic periods. Most of the fine wares from the Hellenistic to the Late Roman periods are of rather poor quality, thus pointing to a local production. Imported pottery, such as Attic black glaze and Eastern Terra Sigillata, was rare. Pottery from the Islamic period (9th-12th centuries) is seemingly absent; however, further analysis might change this impression. Pottery of the 13th and 14th centuries, the Mamluk period, is very com- mon at every village site and, moreover, at several smaller findspots, which might represent nomadic campsites. To conclude, the first season of the Khanasiri survey gave evidence of the rich archaeological potential of the area, especially of the very early prehistoric periods. Further survey work in the re- gion between Khanasiri and Mafraq will place these results into a broader context and enable us to re- construct the cultural history of the entire Khanasi- ri region. 'Iraq al-Amir and the Wadi al-Kafrayn. Chang-Ho C.Ji (cji@lasierra.edu), La Sierra University, andJong Keun Lee, Samyook University, report: The final season of the survey in the regions of 'Iraq al-Amir and the Wadi al-Kafrayn took place for three weeks in July 2000. A total of 41 archaeo- logical sites were found or visited, and this discov- ery brings the survey site total to 216. During the past four years, 175 archaeological sites already have been carefully surveyed, and some of them have now been excavated. Of the 41 sites record- ed during the 2000 survey, six sites contained sherds dated to the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze periods. Late Bronze sherds came from two sites, whereas Iron I, Iron II, and Persian sherds were found at five, five, and four sites respectively. Nine sites yielded Hellenistic pottery; five sites con- tained Roman sherds. Byzantine sherds came from seven sites, and Islamic sherds were found at five sites. In addition to many newly discovered sites, the 2000 survey included several well known sites such as Tall al-Barakat, Khirbat Habbasa, Tall al- Hammam, and Tall al-Bleibel in order to under- stand a broad regional settlement pattern. The following is a short description of five important survey sites; two of them are located in the Jeriya region, two in the Wadi as-Sir region, and the fifth in the Wadi Kafrayn region. Tall al-Bleibel is on a natural rise approximately 200 m north of the Wadi ash-Shu'ayb dam, near the confluence of the Wadi Jeriya with the Wadi ash-Shu'ayb. Part of the defensive wall that once enclosed the site was discernible, particularly on the eastern side. The survey team identified two or three defensive walls on the eastern slope, which probably indicates that Tall Bleibel was fortified at least twice in different periods. According to sur- face sherds, Tall Bleibel was a thriving urban cen- ter during the Hellenistic and Early Roman peri- ods. Khirbat ash-Shu'ayb is a Persian-Hellenistic site on a ridge, ca. 1 km east of Tall al-Bleibel, provid- ing a good view over Tall al-Bleibel and the Wadi Jeriya. The defensive wall encloses the entire site, and the site appears to have been partitioned into four sections by three walls built in an east and west direction. Three round structures of differ- ent sizes were observed along the western outer wall, which seems to have been originally built as part of the defense system. Two additional build- ings are visible near the southern end of the site and were probably used for residency or storage. Perhaps the most important site in the Wadi ash- Shita region is Khirbat ash-Shita, which is bisected by a road from the city of Wadi as-Sir to 'Iraq al-Amir via the Wadi ash-Shita. Although abandoned mod- ern brick houses cover most of the ancient village, part of one ancient, possibly Byzantine-Islamic, building is discernible under one of the late Otto- man brick houses. Turning to the Wadi as-Sir, the survey team visited Khirbat al-Farwa situated on a low rocky knoll by 'Ayn Farwa, ca. 1 km north of al-Baasa. The site has a rela- tively heavy scattering of Iron I-II and Early Helle- nistic potsherds, as well as buildings and at least four caves that were most likely used for residence and storage in antiquity. Khirbat as-Sir is another Late Bronze II-Hellenistic ruin at the head of the Wadi as-Sir, which has now been almost completely bull- dozed to build terraces for horticulture and olive orchards. Given the size of the bulldozed area and a heavy concentration of potsherds, Khirbat as-Sir must 430 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN have been a thriving ancient village that occupied much of the hill. Despite intensive modern activi- ties, some ancient building fragments and several stone heaps are still visible on the surface. The preceding short description may be suffi- cient to demonstrate that the Iron I-Early Helle- nistic period was a period of significant settlement in the regions of Wadi Jeriya and Wadi as-Sir. In contrast, the Wadi ash-Shita and the Wadi Bahath, two upper streams of the Wadi Kafrayn, were more densely populated during the Byzantine-Islamic period than in the earlier periods. These findings are in harmony with the results of previous field- work. Despite the subregional differences in occu- pational pattern, however, the regions of 'Iraq al- Amir and the Wadi al-Kafrayn as a whole continued some level of prosperity from the Chalcolithic peri- od to the Islamic period, as the evidence of more than 200 sites in various periods suggests. The ex- ception to this generalization is the Middle Bronze- Late Bronze I period, for which no evidence exists for settlements dated to this period. On the other hand, the Late Bronze II and Iron I period appears to represent a transition from this occupational gap to the Iron II-early Roman settlement intensifica- tion. Notwithstanding the finds of a number of sherds dating to the Early Bronze II-III period, there is no conclusive evidence for a substantial culture attributable to this period as well. In con- clusion, the survey region seems to have been densely populated during the Chalcolithic-Early Bronze I, Iron II-early Roman, and Byzantine-Is- lamic periods. The Moab Archaeological Resource Survey. Stephen H. Savage, Arizona State University, reports: The Moab Archaeological Resource Survey fin- ished its initial season in 2000. The aim of the project is to gather settlement, ceramic, lithic, fau- nal, and botanical data from sites in an area that appears to have contained a single settlement clus- ter representing a large social unit in the Early Bronze Age (ca. 3500-2000 B.C.). These data will test whether EBA settlement in the Madaba Plain was heterarchical by examining shifting produc- tion and exchange within the site cluster and be- tween other site clusters to the north and south. The field program includes detailed, total station mapping, controlled surface collections, test ex- cavations at known settlements, and pedestrian survey of the western Madaba Plain to discover additional sites. The initial season included map- ping and 20% random, stratified, nonaligned con- trolled surface collections at two sites, Khirbet el- Qarn al-Qubish (Qarn) and al-Megheirat. Qarn is a small site (ca. 2.7 ha) northwest of Mad- aba and southwest of Hesban. An upper site, or acropolis, is located to the north-northeast, and a lower site to the southwest (fig. 3). Based on ce- ramics from the surface collection, Qarn was prob- ably founded during EB I and reached its zenith in EB III, when an extensive fortification system existed around three sides of the hill (excluding the steep south side), and a gate complex domi- nated the site's northeastern approach. The ce- ramic assemblage is mostly EB III, with about 10% from EB I and none from EB IV. Some EB II/III sherds probably belong with the EB III material, but they might date to the EB II. The assemblage contains sherds from many storage vessels, includ- ing large holemouth and necked jars. Many body sherds up to 2.5 cm thick were recovered, indicat- ing that they came from very large vessels. Com- bined with the fortification system, these contain- ers suggest that guarded centralized storage oc- curred at Qarn during EB III. An extensive chipped stone tool industry is represented by blades and debitage; grinding stones and a loom weight or spindle whorl provide evidence of agri- culture and a textile industry. Intact deposition lies on top of the tell and on the northern and western sides. A number of large stone buildings are preserved in stone mounds on the upper and lower site. A small number of Late Roman/Byzan- tine sherds are occasionally found near the stone mounds, and later Ayyubid/Mamluk sherds are sometimes found on the eastern slope, but it seems clear that these later materials are associated with pastoralism and agriculture, rather than any ex- tensive occupation of the site. Al-Megheirat is a residential/ceremonial site, with many standing stones, cobblestone floors (fig. 4), an extensive menhir and dolmen field, and an artifact scatter that extends across approximately 25 ha. Several structures on the low, bedrock hill that dominates the site consist of circles and rect- angles of megalithic stones, with cobble floors laid directly on bedrock. Some of the standing stones are more than 2 m high and were probably columns. At the highest part of the central hill, two concen- tric circles appear to form a "shrine," with a cobble pavement. The outer ring is 8-10 m in diameter, the inner about 4 m across. Little deposition exists in the central precinct, but up to 2 m of light gray, silty, midden type soils are located along the paved road that bisects the site. The 20% surface collec- tion recovered ceramics from the EB, EB I, EB II/ III(?), Roman/Byzantine, Ottoman, and modern periods; EB I sherds dominate the assemblage. 2001] 431</page><page sequence="6">STEPHEN H. SAVAGE ET AL. Fig. 3.

Canaanean blades, scrapers, and informal blade/knives were collected, as well as burins, cores, primary and secondary reduction flakes, preforms, retouched and utilized flakes, and debitage. Tafila-Busayra Archaeological Survey. Burton MacDonald (bmacdona@stfx.ca), St. Francis Xavier University, reports: The Tafila-Busayra Archaeological Survey (TBAS) conducted its first infield season in 1999, and a brief report on that season appeared in July 2000.2 The second infield season took place dur- ing May-June 2000 and is summarized here. units at Khirbet el-Qarn al-Qubish, Moab During the two infield seasons, TBAS team mem- bers investigated an area of ca. 480 km2 in west-cen- tral Jordan in the region from at-Tafila and Busayra in the west to just north of Jurf ad-Darawish in the east. TBAS team members employed two methodol- ogies: (1) transecting random squares in three to- pographic zones, chosen on the basis of a geograph- ic information systems database; and (2) purposive survey. TBAS team members investigated 51 random squares and surveyed 151 sites in 1999; the team transected 69 random squares and surveyed 139 sites this season. TBAS team members also surveyed Wadi al-Juheira Lake, a Pleistocene lake in the vicinity of Jurf ad-Darawish, in both seasons. The 44 sites sur- veyed in the lake region are numbered among the 2 Egan et al. 2000, 561-3. 432 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN / \ 4\1 / m Stone Pile Catchment Basin ...Cistern \r-~ 81 / ~~ E_ 010 20 30 40 50 m ^8 \ Ji^ : K^X X LEGEND \, Z zby/ Structures /i' \ 4J Cobble Pavements T~-^ ~ Stone Pile Q Catchment Basin J Cistern o Collection Units Fig. 4.

In addition, team members continued to "ground-proof' potential sites that D. Kennedy identified on aerial photos. This season's investigation of 63 random squares in zone 2, a plateau area, resulted in the discovery of Lower Paleolithic, Middle Paleolithic, Late Up- per Paleolithic/Epipaleolithic, Ceramic period lithics, Iron II, Hellenistic (in one square only), Early Roman (Nabataean), Roman, Byzantine, and Middle/Late Islamic materials. The survey of 60 sites, either within or near these random squares, yielded archaeological materials from the same periods. The transecting of the six random squares in zone 3, the desert region immediately north of Jurf ad- Darawish, resulted in the collection of Lower, Mid- dle, and Upper Paleolithic materials along with Ceramic period lithics and Roman and Byzantine sherds. In addition to the periods listed above, five sites within and adjacent to the random squares of zone 3 yielded Late Neolithic/Chalcolithic/Early Bronze lithics as well as Middle/Late Islamic sherds. Lower and Middle Paleolithic, as well as Late Epipaleolithic materials, are well represented among the materials collected in the region of Wadi al-Juheira Lake. The Upper Paleolithic is less well represented. The Chalcolithic period is rep- resented in the form of both lithics and sherds. Aside from this period and the Roman and Byzan- tine periods, ceramic materials are absent from the collections from this area. It would appear, there- fore, that this Pleistocene lake was mostly devoid of water for at least the past five-six thousand years. TBAS team members concluded, on the basis of "ground-proofing" of 18 potential sites on aerial photos, that 44% of these are sites. The types of sites that team members investigat- ed during the 2000 season included enclosures/ seasonal camps with architecture; watchtowers (fig. 5); seasonal camps/production/processing cen- ters without architecture; milestones along both the Roman Road (Via Nova Traiana) (fig. 6) and Hajj Route, in the central and eastern segments of the survey territory respectively; forts; and water-catch- 433 2001]</page><page sequence="8">STEPHEN H. SAVAGE ET AL. Fig. 5. Site 260, Rujm al-Hamra, watchtower, Tafila-Busayra Archaeological Survey ment facilities. Twenty-six of the sites surveyed this season are major architectural ones. The largest of these is Khirbat at-Tuwanah, a town along the Ro- man road. On the basis of lithic materials collected during the 2000 season, it can be concluded that the Mid- dle Paleolithic is dominant, especially in the area of the Pleistocene lake. Both the Epipaleolithic and Chalcolithic periods, however, are well represent- ed in the same region. There is little evidence of EB presence in the territory surveyed this season. Moreover, there is no evidence of Middle Bronze and only one probable sherd from the Late Bronze period. Iron I evidence comes from the end of the period. The best-represented materials from the ceramic periods come from the Iron II, Early Ro- man (Nabataean), and Byzantine. While there is little in the way of Early Islamic materials, the Mid- dle/Late Islamic period is well represented, espe- cially at major agricultural sites. Wadi Musa Water Supply and Wastewater Project. Khairieh 'Amr and Ahmed al-Momani, DAJ (khairiehamr@arabia.com), report: The Wadi Musa Water Supply and Wastewater Project is a development project aimed at strength- ening the existing infrastructure of the area. It in- volves excavation for the construction of a large wastewater treatment plant, several reservoirs and pump stations, and over 300 km of pipelines. The area covers a 60 km region of varied terrain, from Jiththa in the southeastern desert to the Bayda mountains overlooking Wadi Arabah in the north- west, including the town of Ayl, al-Qa', at-Tayyiba, Wadi Musa, Umm Sayhun, and Bayda. Archaeological work began with a survey, which took place between 23 October and 16 November 1996, aimed at identifying archaeological remains and giving recommendations for their protection during the implementation of the project. From 20 June 1998 to 31 August 2000, archaeologists were constantly present on site. Outside the built-up ar- eas, planned structures were shifted and pipelines realigned in coordination with the engineers in order to avoid or minimize damage to archaeologi- cal remains. Inside towns, which are basically groups of neighboring archaeological sites where people now live in modern houses that need mod- ern facilities, the pipelines could not be shifted. Therefore, archaeological work inside towns con- sisted of recording what the pipeline trenches re- vealed. Although dug by mechanical means that destroyed much of the archaeological evidence under the modern streets, these trenches offered a unique opportunity to "sample" the built areas, where the archaeological sites are totally buried by modern deposits and structures. The project recorded 132 archaeological sites, ap- proximately 90% of which were previously unrecord- ed. They vary in date from the Middle Paleolithic period to the Ottoman period, with the Neolithic and Nabataean periods being the best represented. There was only scant evidence of the Chalcolithic and Bronze Ages. The sites include nomadic camps, paved roads (including sections of the Via Nova Tra- 434 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN Fig. 6. Site 200, milestone fragments along the Roman Road (Via Nova Traiana), Tafila-Busayra Archaeological Survey iana), farms and farmsteads, dams and water harvest- ing systems, military installations, industrial areas, an ancient mine, watermills, cemeteries, villages, and cities. The project enabled us to look at the varied terrain and climatic zones as a unit, and to see the variety as well as the continuity of use of the different sectors through time. Among the most significant sites are extensive Mid- dle and Epipaleolithic campsites atJiththa; a Natufi- an campsite with 1.5 m deep deposits near the at- Tayyiba town center; a large Neolithic village at al- Basit within the town ofWadi Musa; a fortified Edomite city at al-Muzayr'a near the northwestern edge of Wadi Musa; ancient Gaeia, which spans over 1 km2 beneath the modern Wadi Musa town center, with well pre- served structures and water conveyance systems from the Nabataean and Late Roman periods; Nabataean and Byzantine period kilns at neighboring Zurraba; "poor" Nabataean cemeteries at Umm Sayhun; a well preserved Early Islamic agricultural village at Khirbat Dhba' below the at-Tayyiba town center (fig. 7); and several Ayyubid/Mamluk and Early Ottoman settle- ments scattered from Ayl to Bayda. The 627 artifacts retrieved during the project reflect the variety of the sites. These artifacts in- clude flint tools such as Achulean hand-axes; Neolithic stone basins; pottery vessels, including Nabataean painted bowls and superb kiln wasters; ceramic and lead water pipes; bronze coins, includ- ing a hoard of 116 Late Roman coins; decorative architectural elements; Nabataean mosaic and fres- co panels (fig. 8); elements of food processing in- stallations, including Nabataean and Early Islamic olive presses; and Safaitic, Thamudic, Greek, and Kufic inscriptions.

Olsze- wski, Bishop Museum, Honolulu, report: The Eastern Hasa Late Pleistocene Project (EHLPP) conducted its third season of investiga- tions at Upper and Epipaleolithic sites in the Wadi al-Hasa during the summer of 2000. Research ef- forts were again focused on adaptations to lake and marsh settings in the interior Levant. Excavations were carried out at the Upper Paleolithic site of Thalab al-Buhayra (EHLPP 2) and the Epipaleolith- ic site of Tor al-Tareeq (WHS 1065). This season also included an intensive survey for chert sources in the eastern Hasa basin. At the open-air site of Thalab al-Buhayra, two pre- viously tested areas were expanded. Excavations at locus C exposed cultural material along an ancient shoreline with at least two closely associated early occupations in consolidated marl sediments be- tween 0.3 and 0.77 m below the surface, dated to 25,698 ? 100. Excavations revealed the remnants of at least 13 informal hearths with fire-affected rock, dense primary lithics, and an abundance of well-pre- served specimens representing Bos, Equus, and pos- sibly Sus. Articular fragments, long bones, and crani- al and mandibular fragments are particularly well represented, while axial elements are rare. At least 70 whole teeth were recovered, most of which are large molars of equids. We also recovered the re- mains of a mandible with two tusks and a maxilla fragment with some teeth in place, all of which ap- pear to be from a wild boar, rarely documented at Levantine Upper Paleolithic sites. At locus E, dating to 24,900 ? 100 and positioned stratigraphically above the locus C occupations, remnants of hearths are equally numerous. Equid teeth are also frequent, 3 Schmandt-Besserat (2001, 22 May). 436 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN while rare examples of gazelle teeth have also been uncovered. Blade/bladelet debitage, truncated tools, and narrow scrapers dominate the lithics of locus E, while locus C tool assemblages exhibit a predomi- nance of scrapers and fewer truncated tools. Micro- serrated tools, such as Ksar Akil scrapers, are typical of both areas of the site. The unusually well-pre- served faunal material, in association with stone tools, provides detailed information on procurement strategies featuring hunting, butchering, and pro- cessing of large ungulates within the context of small, short-term encampments along an ancient lakeshore. New excavations were undertaken at Tor al-Tare- eq following previous investigations at the site in 1984 and 1992. Efforts were directed at gaining a better understanding of the Middle Epipaleolithic occupation at the site, the only known example of the Middle Epipaleolithic in the Hasa region. Exca- vations in square B1 contained typical Early Epipale- olithic assemblages dominated by narrow backed microliths. Excavations in squares C1 and C2 provid- ed a complex stratigraphic sequence in which some Early Epipaleolithic materials were displaced downs- lope, resulting in a sequence from top to bottom of (displaced) Early Epipaleolithic, Middle Epipale- olithic, and Early Epipaleolithic. The in situ Early Epipaleolithic contained narrow backed microliths, backed and truncated, truncated, and pointed bl- adelets, and common use of the microburin tech- nique. Above this, Middle Epipaleolithic microliths (relatively frequent wide lunates and wide trapezes) occur with narrow backed microliths and rare mi- croburin technique. The fauna includes large frag- ments in the size range of Bos. An in situ hearth was uncovered and should provide a much-needed ra- diocarbon date for the rare Middle Epipaleolithic. Two additional units (C3 and C4) revealed Middle Epipaleolithic assemblages in the upper levels and Early Epipaleolithic in the lower levels. The lithic assemblages correspond to those found in squares Cl and C2 for these periods. An intensive survey for chert raw material sourc- es was conducted using 22 transect areas. Chert was found to be widely available in the three major geological formations in the eastern Hasa. Prelim- inary analyses suggest that no prehistoric group had to travel farther than 50-100 m from where they camped to gain access to good quality chert, and they appear to have followed the principle of least effort in this regard in virtually all cases.

Preliminary plan of the architecture on Tell Khanasiri, NorthernJordan chaeological Institute, and Fawwaz Al-Khraysheh, DAJ, report: A joint project, entitled Palaeoenvironmental and Archaeological Studies in the Khanasiri Re- gion, between the German Archaeological Insti- tute and the Institute Archaeology and Anthro- pology of Yarmuk University, began in the spring of 1999. One objective of the project was to de- fine the structure and function of Tell Khanasiri (for survey, see Bartl, above). Tell Khanasiri is ca. 30 m high, with bedrock visible up to 15 m. The tell measures approxi- mately 60 x 60 m on the relatively flat top and 100 x 100 m at the base. The tell is nearly circular with a very even shape and contour and surround- ed by a wide ditch, which is partly filled with small stones. The ditch might have been created by quarrying (in antiquity) and was only secondarily used as an element of fortification. The tell was first surveyed, and a 10 x 10 m grid was laid over its surface. The surrounding ditch and the slopes were divided into irregularly shaped units, and then the entire area of 8000 m2 was archaeologi- cally surveyed (fig. 9). The preliminary results of the pottery analysis point to occupation during the Late Iron Age (probably including the Persian period) and the Hellenistic period. The Iron Age ceramics in- clude relatively few fine wares, but lots of cooking- pot ware, storage vessels, and numerous jars. The Hellenistic material consists largely of cooking- pots, middle-sized jars, and mainly regionally imi- tated specimens of the finer slipped wares, as they are known, from the larger Hellenistic sites such 2001] 437</page><page sequence="12">STEPHEN H. SAVAGE ET AL. Fig. 10. Mudbrick room interior with doorway, unit BB, phase 4, Tell Abu en-Ni'aj as Gadara or Pella. Thus far no material dating be- fore the Iron Age has been found. Some Roman pottery, including Eastern Terra Sigillata, has also been found. There is very little material other than pottery; only a few ground-stones, oil lamps, and glass fragments were found. The entire top of the tell seems to be surround- ed by one, and in places two, circular walls; the larg- er walls at the northern and southern sides might be parts of a massive entrance. Some of these outer walls are nearly 1 m thick. There are certainly two phases in these peripheral walls. The existence of walls perpendicular to these peripheral walls might be interpreted as casemate walls at some areas. The interior walls on the top follow, to a large degree, a southeast-northwest direction, and some seem to form rooms or even slightly larger structures. A large hole, which is entirely filled with large boulders and might have been a cistern, was also found on the top. The slopes of the tell were covered by a glacis. On the southwestern and northern slopes, small parts are still preserved in situ, but the larger amount is broken and has fallen into the ditch. Along the sides of the tell, small terracing walls are recognizable; these may have been the structural supports of the glacis. Two small test trenches at the northern base of the tell revealed, in one case, the same pottery as was found on top of the tell (along with some Byz- antine material), and in the other case, mainly Mam- luk and some earlier Islamic materials. The Jordan Valley Village Project: Excavations at Tell Abu en-Ni'aj, 2000. Steven E. Falconer (steven.falconer@asu.edu), Patricia L. Fall, and Jenni- fer E. Jones, Arizona State University, report: Tell Abu en-Ni'aj is an Early Bronze IV agricultur- al village site located southwest of the modern town of Meshara in the northern Jordan Valley, approxi- mately 250 m below sea level and 500 m east of the Jordan River. This low tell, originally measuring 2.5 ha, lies at the edge of the ghor (Jordan Rift bottom- lands), overlooking the zor (modern Jordan River floodplain). Deep stratified deposits (totaling 3.3 m) and a few Early Bronze III sherds found in the lowest levels indicate that Tell Abu en-Ni'aj enjoyed a long occupational history beginning very early in EB IV. The site's stratification provides a rare oppor- tunity to study diachronic changes in village organi- zation, animal and plant use, and craft production during this period of urban collapse (ca. 2300-2000 B.C.). The East Jordan Valley Survey discovered Tell Abu en-Ni'aj in 1975 (site 64). Two weeks of testing were conducted in October 1985 during the final excava- tion season at nearby Tell el-Hayyat. TheJordan Valley Village Project resumed excavation at Tell Abu en- Ni'aj in a five-week season during December 1996 and January 1997, and continued with a 10-week sea- son between January and March 2000. Ten 4 x 4 m units excavated in 1985 produced abundant material culture, floral and faunal re- mains, and mudbrick architecture consistent with 438 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN Fig. 11. Mudbrick room interior with smashed pottery on floor, unit K, phase 4, Tell Abu en-Ni'aj a sedentary Early Bronze IV farming village. Sound- ings in two units reached archaeologically sterile sediments and revealed at least three major EB IV strata. The 1996-1997 season demonstrated that Tell Abu en-Ni'aj contains stratified deposits span- ning most or all of Early Bronze IV. Evidence from the basal level suggests that Tell Abu en-Ni'aj was founded shortly after the end of Early Bronze III, then rebuilt in a series of six successive strata last- ing until approximately 2000 B.C. (phase 7 is the earliest and phase 1 the latest). Sixteen contigu- ous 4 x 4 m units revealed a series of domestic struc- tures (figs. 10, 11) and sherd-paved streets located west of courtyards with hearths, pits, storage bins, and a large mudbrick installation possibly used for pressing olives or grapes. Noncultural sediments were reached in 13 of the 14 4 x 4 m units excavated in 2000, including five started during the 1996-1997 season. In fall 1999 bulldozing on the western side of Tell Abu en-Ni'aj cleared a 26 m long stratigraphic cross-section, re- vealing an earthquake slip fault. Early Bronze IV deposits capped a series of offset ash layers, indi- cating that the earthquake occurred during the occupation of Tell Abu en-Ni'aj. A group of three articulated sheep burials allude to Early Bronze IV ritual behavior. Each burial was marked with sever- al 20-50 cm high stones, and each sheep was bur- ied in a 1 m deep pit on its right side, with its head pointed east. The 2000 field season also revealed diachronic changes in village architecture and ceramic manu- facture. Village houses grew denser through time and wall alignments shifted to a new orientation between phases 6 and 5. Despite these changes, Tell Abu en-Ni'aj appears to have been occupied continuously from the time it was founded. Rough- ly accompanying the architectural changes, local potters stopped using large calcite inclusions in favor of smaller basalt and limestone particles, com- monly known as "salt and pepper" temper. These changes hint at the vitality and growing population of this village during the collapse of regional ur- banism. Tall al-'Umayri. Douglas R. Clark (clardo@- wwc.edu), Walla Walla College, Larry G. Herr, Ca- nadian University College, and Warren C. Tren- chard, La Sierra University, report: The 2000 excavations at Tall al-'Umayri have un- covered several new levels of occupation that date to times when settlements in Jordan were rare. Lo- cated a few kilometers south of Amman, the site has now produced over 20 impressive superim- posed settlements. While not a new discovery at 'Umayri, the Early Bronze I dolmen on the southeastern slope of the tell has revealed more earthen and plaster surfac- es surrounding it-at least six distinct surfaces uphill of the dolmen and three below. This is the first dolmen in the Mediterranean basin to produce significant quantities of burials (20), complete pot- tery vessels (20), and surfaces indicating ceremo- nial patterns of use. The most impressive discoveries of the current season include the remains of a Late Bronze Age building whose walls were over 1 m thick and sur- vive to 3.5 m high in places (fig. 12). It is one of the best preserved structures from this time in the southern Levant and certainly a rare example in Jordan. The building must have served an impor- tant function. Tall al-'Umayri has also produced one of the best preserved towns from the early Iron Age in Jordan. Several house walls stand 2 m high, and pillar bases indicate that wooden posts supported the roofs. This settlement probably represents nomadic trib- al groups settling into towns and villages. One of the houses, an excellent example of a typical hill- 2001] 439</page><page sequence="14">STEPHEN H. SAVAGE ET AL. Fig. 12. The Late Bronze Age building at Tall al-'Umayri, with its massive walls surviving 3.5 m high in places and forming two rooms of a larger structure, which disappears into the northern balk country "four-room" house and the best preserved anywhere, has been partially restored with wooden posts and beams, the first-story ceiling, and a por- tion of the second story made of bricks. In an adjacent building to the south, destruction debris covered a layer of burned and broken ceram- ic vessels. These were on the floor of a major build- ing consisting of four rooms-three wide rooms and a fourth smaller room jutting out to the south, in which were seven curious stones lying down. They may have been used in some cultic fashion. Another new story can now be told regarding a large plastered area belonging to the llth-lOth centuries B.C. On the plaster and cobble surfaces excavated here, excavators found smashed pottery, including a ceramic cult stand with two curious standing figures having only one breast each (fig. 13). They faced each other in the stand, clearly iden- tifiable as female from the profiles they presented, but each one was missing the breast on the inner side of the cult stand. What might these tell us about the ancient Ammonite religion? A minor settlement at the site is also apparent from the Late Hellenistic period (ca. 150-50 B.C.) when a few residents constructed a small farmstead on the southern edge of the site. It may have pro- duced wine on the surrounding hillsides and grain crops in the valley bottoms. In the courtyard of the building, the team found small complete ceramic juglets and lamps as well as food-produc- ing implements. Among the small finds were several seals, includ- ing one made by the Hyksos rulers of Egypt. This brings the total number of seals discovered at 'Umayri to over 80. Most of the seals were associat- ed with the administrative complex from the Late Iron Age and represent bureaucratic activity there. Continued research on the faunal remains from the Early Iron I midden has revealed the presence of bones from a lion, a brown bear, and Nile Perch. To help keep the remains at 'Umayri accessible to scholars and other visitors, a major restoration effort is underway. This includes protective bound- aries, observation platforms, wall consolidation, in- terpretive signage, and a 1:1 scale complete repro- duction of the Iron I four-room house that will serve as a visitors center. Khirbet Iskander. Suzanne Richard (richard@- gannon.edu), Gannon University, Jesse C. Long, Jr., Lubbock Christian University, and Bill Libby, Mc- Murry University, report: The 2000 expedition to Khirbet Iskander took place between 23 May and 8 July. The overarching goal of the project from its inception has been to investigate the nature and extent of sedentism in the EB IV, a nonurban period often described as a pastoral interlude between the two urban eras of the Early Bronze and Middle Bronze Ages, ca. 2300-2000 B.C.E. Khirbet Iskander is a medium-sized town site that apparently was occupied throughout the EBA, given the latest evidence from the 1997 season for EB I and EB II-III remains on the mound. The project has broadened its research design beyond investigating sociopolitical complexity in the EB IV to documenting the still-elusive stratigraphic transi- tion between the urban and nonurban periods. The goals in area B this season were to: 1) broad- en the overall exposure of the EB IV phases A-B settlements, 2) expose laterally the urban structures Fig. 13. Parts of a late Iron I cult stand with two one-breasted female figurines, which evidently occupied the sides of an opening on the stand, Tall al-CUmayri 440 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN encountered in square B2 at the west end, 3) clari- fy the secondary defensive line that abuts the north- west corner bastion, and 4) continue the geomor- phological survey of the vicinity of Khirbet Iskander. This short report summarizes the new discover- ies in the EB IV phase A settlement and will discuss the urban structures in relation to the fortifications. A new tier of 6 squares was opened on the south, bringing the total to 18 (5 x 5 m) squares. Com- plete architectural units were excavated as well as what appeared to be a cobbled street, both of which illuminate the overall plan of the neighborhood. Excavation uncovered a multiroomed house with two doorways, both of which opened into a kitchen area. The latter comprised a tabun, an associated mortar and working slab/bench, and a bin area. In a courtyard at the east end, a 2.5 m wide stone- lined silo or well came to light. The bottom had not been reached by the end of the season, although the depth was ca. 3 m. A possible second such silo or well began to appear in a courtyard at the west end. This season's work confirmed that the west- ern perimeter wall dictated the orientation of hous- es in that area, since it served as their back wall. It is this perimeter wall that Glueck observed on the west. We have previously reported that this wall did not appear to be the original defensive line because it abuts and is at a much higher founding level than the northwest corner tower. This information, along with a newly discovered house wall built up against the outer fortification on the north, represents the first evidence that the latest EB IV phase utilized sections of the rebuilt fortifications. This new evidence makes the phase A area C gateway more comprehensible. The evi- dence for the EB IV phase B use of the fortifica- tions has always been clear. The project exposed, in three squares, the ur- ban phase C layers first discovered in square B2 in 1997. In square B1, beneath whole mudbricks, de- tritis, and much ash, a cache of vessels was discov- ered on a surface that included pillar bases. Once restored, these vessels should greatly clarify the date of this destruction layer, whether EB II or EB III. A section through the western stone perimeter wall mentioned above has confirmed the lateness of this wall. It was found lying on top of a destroyed mudbrick and stone defensive wall that was found in two squares. The construction history of the for- tifications is gradually coming into sharper focus. It is now evident that the founding of the fortifica- tions must date to the urban EB II-III periods and that in the EB IV period, the defenses had been reused and rebuilt. Zahrat adh-Dhra'. Steven Falconer and Patricia Fall, Arizona State University, and Phillip Edwards, La Trobe University, report: The sites of Zahrat adh-Dhra' 1 and 2 (ZAD 1 and 2) lie at approximately 180 mbsl amid the bad- lands of the Plain of Dhra' overlooking the Lisan Peninsula. Both sites were discovered in 1989 and included in the 1994 archaeological survey by P.C. Edwards, P.G. Macumber, and M.K. Green.4 ZAD 1 features visible stone architecture over 6 ha along a ridge bounded by wadis to the north and south. Truncated buildings along the ridge's southern face and across the Wadi adh-Dhra' to the south imply that ZAD 1 originally extended over perhaps 12 ha of plain that was incised 25 m deep by subse- quent downcutting of the Wadi adh-Dhra'. Boul- der alignments at both ends of the site may mark Pleistocene beach lines of Lake Lisan. Excavations in winter 1999-20(0 investigated the eastern boulder alignment, several nonarchi- tectural locations, stratified organic deposits on a lower terrace in the Wadi adh-Dhra', and a variety of one and two room rectilinear structures, some with attached curvilinear courtyard or enclosure walls (fig. 14). Interior floors were excavated be- low wall founding levels similar to EB II pithouses in the Sinai. Stratified floors separated by noncul- tural sediments suggest annual or seasonal dis- use or abandonment. ZAD 1 ceramics, being studied by Ilya Beralov, appear to be Middle Bronze II A and B, including abundant flat-bottomed cooking pots, storage jars with frequent drilled mend holes and no handles, and very few fine ware forms. One jar features in- cised ibexes, similar to an example from Bab edh- Dhra. Botanical remains, under study by Cathryn Meegan, include cultivated barley, wheat, legumes, grapes, and figs. Wild taxa include Chenopodium, Amaranthus, and various grasses. Animal bones iden- tified by Mary Metzger are entirely domesticated sheep/goat (Ovis aries/Capra hircus), except for one domesticated pig (Sus scrofa). ZAD 2 is a Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) set- tlement situated only 200 m from ZAD 1. The site is a low, circular mound about 2 m thick and 2,000 m2 in area. Numerous ground stone artifacts on the site's surface are intermingled with the remains of an extensive flaked stone industry. 4 Edwards et al. 1998. 2001] 441</page><page sequence="16">STEPHEN H. SAVAGE ET AL. Fig. 14. A rectilinear structure with attached curvilinear courtyard or enclosure walls at ZAD 1, Zahrat adh-Dhra' Of the 17 curvilinear walls emerging through top- soil, excavations into three were begun in 1999. Struc- ture 1, which was truncated by a gully, represented a semicircular walled dwelling built of stone fragments set into lime mortar. Excavation of structure 2 yield- ed a three-coursed section of curved stone walling associated with a floor and interior hearth set with stones and plaster (fig. 15). A second wall curved away in the opposite direction, and a human skull was placed in the interstices between the two walls. Char- coal samples from succeeding phases of occupation in structure 3 yielded three radiocarbon dates be- tween 9490 and 9400 uncal. B.P. Obsidian flakes, fragments of green copper ore, a second green mineral, and marine Dentalium shells suggest long-range contacts. The most notable piece of art mobilierwas a limestone plaque from structure 2, incised with a geometric pattern. A large quantity of lithics, being analyzed by Ghattas Sayej, include many tool types, such as sickle blades, picks, adzes, Hagdud truncations, borers/drills, and scrapers-but surpris- ingly few projectile points. Animal bone fragments include wild goat and cat- tle, a possible badger, and a crab claw. Many larger fragments could belong to gazelle. Plant remains, being studied by John Meadows, include barley and wheat, fig, lentil, Pistacia atlantica shell fragments, and a spherical pulse similar to a small pea. Most of the barley and grain fragments are wild, but some are large enough to be domesticated, and one grain apex was identified as probable domestic einkorn wheat. Jabal Hamrat Fidan. Thomas E. Levy (tlevy@- weber.ucsd.edu), University of California, San Di- ego, Russell B. Adams, University of Bristol, and Mohammad Najjar, DAJ, report: During July and August 2000, the University of California, San Diego, University of Bristol, and the DAJ carried out excavations at the site of Khirbet Hamra Ifdan (KHI) in southern Jordan. As part of the Jabal Hamrat Fidan (JHF) Regional Archaeolo- gy Project, the excavations at KHI aimed at study- ing the role of early ore procurement and metal- lurgy on social evolution in the southern Levant. In addition to the excavation, a number of re- search activities took place. These included: (1) geophysical surveys at the closest copper mines to KHI, (2) a botanical survey in the JHF region, (3) geomorphological surveys along the Wadi Fidan, (4) biological anthropological studies of the Iron Age human remains recovered in earlier excava- tions, (5) archaeozoological studies of the KHI fauna remains, as well as material from the 1999 excavations at the PPNB site of Wadi Fidan 001 (WFD 001), (6) lithic analyses of the KHI and WFD 001 stone tool assemblages, (7) digital photogra- phy of the 2000 KHI artifact assemblages, (8) ar- chaeometallurgical identification of the 1999 and 2000 assemblages, (9) GIS linkages of all data sets (architecture and artifacts) from the KHI excava- tions, and (10) the placement of signage and the [AJA 105 442</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN Fig. 15. A three-coursed section of curved stone walling associated with a floor and interior hearth set with stones and plaster, ZAD 2, Zahart adh-Dhra' construction of trails and presentation walls at the four main sites excavated in the JHF since 1997. KHI is situated on a naturally defended Pleistocene terrace that forms a plateau or iselberg in the middle of the Wadi Fidan drainage. During the Early Bronze Age, the site was occupied during three main peri- ods, including the EB II, III, and IV. The main occu- pation phase, however, focused on the EB III (ca. 2700- 2200 B.C.E.) when Palestine experienced the height of its first urban experience. The 2000 excavations were aimed at identifying domestic habitation units linked to the EB III copper metal manufactory first exposed in 1999 (fig. 16). By the end of the season, more than 70 rooms and courtyards were exposed at the site. Most of these were rectangular rooms laid out in a carefully planned orientation and linked in various ways to the manufacture of metal. A probe was made in the southern aspect of the site inside a large, square-shaped, architectural feature visible on the surface (fig. 17). The probe was used to date this sur- face structure to a series of phases spanning the Byz- antine and Roman periods. The basal layers of the probe revealed a well-built plastered pool or reser- voir dating to the EB III. The EB III metallurgical remains included a wealth of material closely linked to the "mass" pro- duction of copper tools and ingots. Some of the realms of material culture linked to metallurgy ac- tivities include ore, slag, copper prills, crucible frag- ments, recycled copper metal, finished metal prod- ucts (axes, chisels, pins, needles, arrowheads, awls, and ingots), clay casting molds for these finished products, and casting molds for ingots. The ingots are remarkably similar to (although mostly larger than) EB IV ingots found in sites in the Negev desert. Preliminary studies by Andreas Hauptmann indicate that the Negev ingots are chemically iden- tical to those produced at KHI. Following observations made in 1999, it is clear that one of the reasons so many artifacts were dis- covered in the various rooms and courtyards at KHI was because of site formation processes. Periodical abandonment of the site was evidenced by the in- tentional closure of most doorways in the settlement during the last occupation phase. Doorways were blocked using stones and mud daub, effectively sealing most rooms and their contents. Shortly af- ter the site was intentionally abandoned, there was a major EB III earthquake, which threw down brick walls and roofs of every architectural feature. In this way, the site suffered from what is sometimes called the "Pompeii effect." In the case of KHI, while site inhabitants were not caught in the earthquake, the rooms that were filled with stored pottery, metal workshop debris, and other finds were sealed for several hundred years until the site was reoccupied during the EB IV period.

Overview of the excavations in the s EB III metal "manufactory" at Khirbet Hamra Ifdan (KHI). The courtyard in the center was the focus of casting activities. The Archaeological Survey and Excavation in the Yutum and Magass Area Project (ASEYM), a joint project between the University of Jordan (Amman) and the German Archaeological Institute (Berlin), completed its second season in Aqaba on 2 March 2000. The two main goals of this project were to excavate at Hujayrat al Ghuzlan and to survey the area southeast of Aqaba. Hujayrat al Ghuzlan is located approximately 3 km north of Aqaba. The site was investigated dur- ing the 1990 season, and an intensive survey was conducted in 1998. In square E12, which lies at the eastern sector of the site, two types of walls were revealed. The walls were either straight or round- ed and constructed of undressed stones or un- dressed stones with mud. Square G4-5, which lies in the southwestern sector of the site, was also exca- vated. Mud brick walls that formed a room measur- ing approximately 2 x 3 m were revealed. Three large rounded pottery jars, perhaps once used for storage, were found inside this room (fig. 18). The site had been destroyed in many places by deep trenches, especially at the middle of the site. The destroyed area was carefully excavated and cleaned in order to understand the relation of the stratigraphy and the radiation of the walls at the middle of the site. A room constructed of un- dressed stones and measuring approximately 6 x 4 m was revealed. In addition, a circular platform, similar to one excavated at a lower level, was found. This platform is paved with medium-sized un- dressed stones. In addition to stratigraphy and architecture, var- ious artifacts were found, including a large quanti- ty of tabular scrapers and pottery sherds that date to the Late Chalcolithic and EB I. Archaeometallurgi- cal remains were also revealed, such as fragments of pottery crucibles and molds, copper ore, slags, and copper artifacts. The results of '4C dating indi- cate that this site was inhabited from ca. 3600 to 2900 B.C. Paleobotanical samples that were collected from various loci were analyzed. Results indicated the presence of two-row hulled barley and emmer wheat. In order to have cultivated these cereal crops, the inhabitants would have had to employ irrigation. About 5,000 animal bone remains from Hujayrat al-Ghuzlan and Tell Magass were examined. Do- mestic animal remains, particularly those of goat and sheep, accounted for nearly 80% of the total faunal remains. Domestic cattle remains were also 444 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN Fig. 17. A probe was made in the corner of a Roman/Byzantine carvansari located at KHI.

The wild mammal faunal re- mains consisted of many different species, includ- ing onager, dorcas, mountain gazelle, Arabian oryx, deer, and cape hare. The archaeological and topographical survey was carried out to the southeast of Aqaba, covering an area of ca. 50 x 25 km between Wadi Yutum al-Am- ran and the Saudi border. Approximately 75 archae- ological sites were recorded using GPS. Based on the artifacts that were found, the sites date to the Late Palaeolithic, Epipalaeolithic, Pre-Pottery Neolithic, Chalcolithic, Early Bronze Age, Nabatae- an, Roman, Byzantine, and Islamic periods. Camp- sites and tombs of an uncertain age also were found. In addition, the survey discovered petroglyphs of animal and human figures and writing on rocks in Thamudic, Nabataean, and Arabic script. NABATAEAN, ROMAN, BYZANTINE, ISLAMIC Abila. W. W. Harold Mare (whmare@aol.com), Cove- nant Theological Seminary, reports: During the 2000 excavation at Abila of the Deca- polis, conducted from 17 June to 5 August, the ar- chaeological team concentrated on further exca- vating the deep trenches on Tell Abila. These trenches revealed a larger area of Middle Bronze Age and Early Bronze Age habitation. In addition, the team concentrated on the excavation of several Byzantine churches. The ruins of five churches, all located within a quarter mile of each other, have been or continue to be excavated. On the north tell, Tell Abila, all available limestone and basalt column drums and capitals of the sixth century tri- apsidal basilica were restored. In an earlier season, on the south tell, Umm al 'Amad, the project had restored the seventh-eighth century triapsidal ba- silica with two rows of columns, arranged in an al- ternating pattern of one limestone column followed by a basalt column. In the saddle depression between the two tells, the Abila team further excavated the sixth-century cruciform basilica, which revealed four rows of ba- salt columns and Ionic capitals, five aisles, mosaics, and inscriptions. Major emphasis was placed on excavating the narthex area just west of the five entrances leading into the church. In this area, the team uncovered four monolithic white marble col- umns and parts of two additional marble columns. In addition, six white marble Corinthian capitals and a limestone stylobate running across the front of the narthex were also found. At the end of the season, with the help of a crane, the team was able 2001] 445</page><page sequence="20">STEPHEN H. SAVAGE ET AL. Fig. 18. Potteryjars found inside a mudbrick room in square G4-5, Hujayrat al Ghuzlan to reerect the four monolithic columns and capi- tals and parts of three other columns on the stylo- bate at the west entrance leading into the narthex. This cruciform basilica was built along the same structural plan as the sixth-century Justinian Nativ- ity cruciform basilica at Bethlehem. It was probably the cathedral of Abila's bishop, who is mentioned in a sixth-century inscription that was found in an Abila underground aqueduct and deciphered by Baastian Van Elderen. Jerash.J-P. Braun, I. Kehrberg, andJ. Manley, IFA- PO (ifapo-jor@nets.com.jo), report: The city walls of Gerasa are among the best pre- served of any in the Roman empire. The wall ex- tends for approximately 3.5 km enclosing ca. 85 ha. There are 5 known gates and over 101 square tow- ers projecting at regular intervals of 17-22 m. The traditional date for the building of the walls is based on an inscription found in the late 1920s. The late first-century A.D. inscription, supposedly of the northwest gate, was seen to fit the urban plan for Greater Syria and thus the construction of the city wall. More recently, this was challenged in favor of a late third/early fourth-century date, and the de- bate has since continued. A resolution of this issue seemed important, in view of Gerasa's place in the Decapolis, and could only be solved by excavation. It was critical to have begun this examination be- cause modern Jerash is claiming much of the walls in its urban spread in the east where, in places, the walls still stand several meters high-but one fears, not for long. The first of the city walls excavations were conducted against the inside face of the west wall, north of the south theater. Much of the walls are founded directly on bedrock, which provides no stratified foundation deposits. Therefore, a site was chosen where the wall crosses a wadi bed that necessitated a foundation trench and built foun- dations. The DAJ had already removed above- ground tumble to install a modern gate from the heliport to the site. The results of three weeks of digging proved spectacularly successful. A deep foundation trench was located (fig. 19); the city wall rested on a plat- form of large, irregular boulders that had been placed in rough layers at the bottom of the founda- tion trench (fig. 20). The wall is built from the bot- tom course up of dressed embossed blocks, no dif- ferent from those higher up. The first course of the clear-standing wall is slightly recessed, parallel to the top of the foundation trench, a common fea- ture of first and second-century A.D. Jerash (cf. the hippodrome and two theaters). A retaining wall was placed across the foundation trench to act as a bar- 446 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN Fig. 19. View of the excavation trench along the Jerash city wall rier for the earth fill of the trench; its construction indicated that the wall construction at that location was advanced from north to south (the only "face" is south of this simple wall holding the dirt in place). The foundation trench falls slightly to the south, which became evident in the differing heights of the balk at either end of the excavated sections. The clearly discernible foundation trench was cut into a waste dump containing masses of pottery, partly wasters and partly residual. The excavated trench balk revealed homogeneous first-century B.C./A.D. ceramics, with a few types dating up to the end of the first century A.D. and possibly some types dating into the early second century A.D. The local assemblage alone would suffice to date the context. Collateral finds supporting the dating are imported sigillata, a Nabataean coin of probably Aretas IV, and glass. The foundation fill and the post-fill layer held much of the same material, but the latter included a "Gerasa Lamp" and Nabatae- an and local bowl type fragments dating to the early part of the second century A.D. These materials date the wall here to the first half of the second century, and very possibly Trajanic, based on the greater mass of first-century A.D. ceramic types, with only very few early second-century and no late sec- ond-century forms. The material assemblage has yet to be studied in detail, but it already shows clear- ly that the wall was built in the first half of the sec- ond century. Khirbet Yajuz. Lutfi Khalil, University of Jordan, reports: The University ofJordan's Department of Archae- ology completed its sixth season at Khirbet Yajuz, located 11 km north of Amman. Excavations at this site, operated as a field school, provide invaluable hands-on experience for the department's under- graduate and Master's level students. During the 1999 and 2000 seasons, the students made many important discoveries. In area C, two large adjacent wine presses were discovered. The northern press dates to the Byzan- tine period, and the southern press may date to the second century A.D. The sizes of these elaborate presses suggest that large vineyards were cultivat- ed in the area, and wine was produced on an inten- sive scale. These wine presses were probably used intensively during the sixth and seventh centuries. To the west of the wine presses, two large rooms, with internal arches, were revealed. One room, ori- ented east-west, measures approximately 15 x 6.5 m, and has seven arches. The other room is orient- ed north-south, measures approximately 12.5 x 6.3 m, and has six arches. The first room has a plaster floor, and the second has a floor of hard, compact red clay. The arches and the vaulted roof had col- lapsed onto the floors. A preliminary study of the pottery and coins from various destruction layers indicates that these items date to the Umayyad period. Therefore, it may be deduced that both rooms were constructed during the Byzantine period. The rooms may have been used as living quarters or for storage purposes re- lated to the wine presses and the flour mill. A residential building (area D) was revealed in the northern sector of the site; the complete unit measures approximately 27 x 20 m. The main en- trance of the building, approximately 1 m wide, is on the south side (fig. 21). The walls, built on bed- rock, are constructed of dressed stones that range between 0.9 and 1.1 m. The unit consists of 11 rooms, two caves, and a courtyard with a cistern and tabun. The rooms measure either 5 x 5 m or 11 x 5 m, and two types of internal arches were used to support their ceilings. The first type of arch was constructed adjacent to the wall of the room, and 2001 ] 447</page><page sequence="22">STEPHEN H. SAVAGE ET AL. Fig. 20. Platform of boulders in the foundation trench atJerash the second type was constructed within the wall of the room. The pottery, lamps, coins, and other ob- jects found in the stratigraphy date the building's foundation to the Byzantine period and its destruc- tion to the end of the Umayyad period. RortL Fig. 21. Area D, the residential area at KhirbetYajuz. Scale 1:200. In area E, an earthquake that occurred in A.D. 748 is illustrated by the collapsed vaulted arches and the irregularities of the paved floor, which date to the Umayyad period. Later, the collapsed arches were reinforced and strengthened, and dividing walls were added. In addition, a layer of compact hawar was added on top of the pavement in order to make it level, and materials from previous periods were used (fig. 22). Two different types of pottery, associ- ated with different architectural periods, were exca- vated at the area. Therefore, evidence suggests that the earthquake destroyed the building during the Umayyad period, and the building was later restored during the Abassid period. A sounding trench (F) was made between areas C and D, and deep stratigraphy was excavated. The preliminary study of the finds from various loci dates the materials to the Byzantine period. In addition, another sounding trench (G), made south of area E at the edge of the site, revealed Umayyad pottery. In conclusion, Khirbet Yajuz was founded dur- ing the Late Roman period on the main road be- tween Amman and Jerash. The city continued to flourish during the Byzantine and the Umayyad periods. Despite the destruction caused by the earthquake in 748, evidence of occupation during the Abassid period exists. Wadi al-Kharrar. Mohammad Waheeb, DAJ, reports: The Wadi al-Kharrar Archaeological Project, con- ducted by a team from the DAJ between 1997 and 2000, has confidently identified the site of the Bap- tism. The site is located approximately 200 m east 448 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN Fig. 22. Paved room at KhirbetYajuz of the Jordan River and 100 m north of the tradi- tional site of the Baptism in Wadi al-Kharrar. The site contains the remains of three churches, the second of which is built partially on the founda- tions of the first, with the third built directly on top of the second (fig. 23). The First Church Preliminary results of the excavations revealed foundations for arches and walls and partially pre- served mosaic and marble floors in situ. Some of the arches were documented in a survey conducted by Abel during 1881. Because no excavations had pre- viously been undertaken on the eastern side of the river, the first church may be the church described by ancient pilgrims who passed through this area on their way fromJerusalem to Mount Nebo on the east- ern side of the Jordan River. This discovery removes all doubts about the exact location of the church, which was built on the eastern side of the river to commemorate Christ's Baptism. The foundations of the church were dug deeply into the ground to pro- tect the structure from possible flooding of the Jor- dan River and the Wadi al-Kharrar spring during the winter and spring seasons. Based on the foundations, it is logical to assume that a staircase from the western side of the church led up into the structure. The pillar foundations of this church were built in three rows that are direct- ed east-west. While the pillar foundations of the western side were built close to each other, the foun- dations of the eastern side were spread further apart. This leads us to suggest that when people crossed the Jordan River from the west to continue their pil- grimage, the first site visible to them was the entrance of the church on the eastern side of the river. Among the discovered materials were pottery sherds that mostly date to the Late Byzantine period; some coins that date to the fifth and sixth centuries; roof tiles; and assorted marble pavement fragments. The church dates broadly to the Byzantine period. The Third Church The third church was partially constructed on top of the southern pillar foundations of the first church, while the remainder was built directly above the second church. The builders of this unique church used several materials, which include well- dressed sandstone ashlars, marble pavement of dif- ferent kinds and colors, and mosaic floors with flo- ral and geometric designs that reflect a tremen- dous amount of skill. The church has three aisles and was paved with colorful mosaics. The northern aisle was built on part of the first church, while the central and south- ern aisles were directly built on top of a second 2001 ] 449</page><page sequence="24">STEPHEN H. SAVAGE ET AL. Fig. 23.John the Baptist Church, viewed from the east, Wadi al-Kharrar Archaeological Project church that was only partly excavated. The northern and southern aisles of the church were paved with mosaics that had geometrical designs and cross sym- bols. Some of these mosaics are still in situ, particu- larly in the southwestern corner of the southern aisle. The church's altar was located in the middle of the central aisle. In the chancel screen area, part of a mosaic with a floral design lies in situ. The western section of the church was partly dam- aged and removed, possibly by a flood. The builders of the church had raised the ground level to keep the body of the church above possible river floods. A thick layer of accumulation was added on top of the lower church to raise the ground to a safe level. To the east of the altar, a square platform, paved with marble in several shapes and colors, was dis- covered during the 1999 season. What distinguish- es this area is the staircase leading down to the wa- ter source. Although the staircase was damaged, some steps, built of black "marble" ashlars, remain in situ. Other discoveries include the remains of the chancel post, which was found resting on the mar- ble floor; many pottery sherds, scattered marble pieces, and mosaic tesserae; and two marble Corinthian capitals. Although some white, red, and black marble fragments were recovered, most of the marble pieces were either robbed or washed away in antiquity. The church dates to the late Byzantine period. Only limited excavations were conducted on the second church, which was entirely covered by the third church. Some of the marble pavement that was revealed from the second church shows that the builders were very skilled. Tell Madaba. Timothy P. Harrison (tim.harrison@- utoronto.ca), University of Toronto, reports: The 2000 Tell Madaba Archaeological Project (TMAP) field season represented the third year of full-scale excavations in fields B and C on the west- ern slope of Tell Madaba, and it continued the ef- fort to document the extensive archaeological se- quence preserved on the tell acropolis begun in 1998. The principal objectives in field B were to (1) complete excavation and documentation of the Early Roman/Nabataean (field phases [FP] 2 and 3) and Late Hellenistic (FPs 4 and 5) strata; (2) consolidate the architectural remains from these strata; (3) establish the parameters for continued excavations into earlier, preclassical strata; and (4) continue excavation of the Iron Age (FPs 6 and earlier) remains defined within these parameters. In field C, meanwhile, the primary goal was to com- plete the excavation, documentation, and consoli- dation of a series of Late Byzantine/Early Islamic structures to the west of the preclassical city wall damaged by bulldozing in the early 1980s. By the end of the season, excavation of the Late Hellenistic and Early Roman/Nabataean strata first articulated during the 1998 and 1999 seasons was 450 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN complete, with Iron II levels fully exposed (and partially excavated) within a confined area (ca. 10 x 15 m) against the interior of the town fortification wall.5 The excavations in field C, however, revealed the well-preserved remains of a building complex, considerably more extensive than previously thought, which warrants additional description here. The two-phase architectural sequence span- ning the Late Byzantine/Early Islamic transition (sixth-seventh/eighth centuries C.E.) first hypoth- esized in 1998, and reinforced with stratigraphic evidence in 1999, was further substantiated by the 2000 season findings. Initially believed to have been isolated shops that backed against the preclassical town fortification wall, the 2000 season excavations demonstrated unequiv- ocally that these structures were the back rooms of a large building complex, at least 20 m (north-south) x 30 m (east-west) in size, that faced on to a possible north-south street to the west. The complex was erected on a series of bedrock terraces that ascend- ed from the west toward the fortification wall. Al- though the building has not yet been fully excavat- ed, thus far excavations have revealed a series of in- terconnected rooms with variously paved floors. In at least two rooms, the floors were paved with deco- rated mosaic pavements. One contained a field of fleurettes or rosebuds framed by a double-swastika meander border, while the second depicted a large amphora flanked by a ram and a horned stag, with a simple border of diamonds. Several rooms preserved remains of arches, and in one case an intact vault, which had supported a second story to the building, was preserved. At least one second-floor room con- tained a decorated mosaic floor. One of the more striking features of the field C building is the elaborate water system that serviced it. Fragmentary pieces of large ceramic drainpipes were recovered from the excavated debris, and sev- eral meters of intact clay piping were found em- bedded behind plaster in one of the building's walls. In another room, the excavations revealed a network of water channels and trap-dams concealed beneath a heavy flagstone pavement. In addition, many of the building's rooms were equipped with rectangular stone drainage basins. The building also produced a wealth of small finds, including a ceramic assemblage representative of the sixth and seventh/eighth centuries, a bronze jug and other metal implements, several coins, and a ceramic stamp seal. While the primary function of the com- plex remains unclear, its layout and associated finds suggest a wealthy private residence. Petra. The Great Temple. Martha Sharp Jou- kowsky (Martha_Joukowsky@brown.edu), Brown University, reports: The Great Temple's spectacular setting and ar- chitecture as the largest freestanding monument in Petra strengthens its significance as one of the primary Nabataean ceremonial cult centers of the city. The Upper Temenos surround has been cut of the living rock where there is a sacred cult effigy in relief. Springs and a complex series of hydraulic systems were diverted to serve its ritual. Its signifi- cance is emphasized by its eclectic architecture- the Lower Temenos flanked by porticoes, colon- nades, and distyle exedrae were constructed pur- posefully for cult practices. The massive tetrastyle- in-antis Great Temple and its theatron were set apart from the hustle and bustle of the center city and suggest that it was dedicated to consecration. The eighth excavation season was conducted by Brown University archaeologists from June to Au- gust 2000. This year's work concentrated primarily on the Great Temple, but the so-called Small Tem- ple, identified by Wiegand and Bachmann, locat- ed to the west of the precinct, was also investigated. Using a total station, we converted our data to global positioning satellite technology. These data are presented in Universal Transverse Mercator grid coordinates. These data for the Petra Mapping Project, sponsored by the American Center of Ori- ental Research and undertaken by the Hashemite University, will provide researchers with a plan of central Petra with sub-centimeter accuracy. The Small Temple The Small Temple measured 13.3 m east-west x 7.7 m north-south. In situ blocks were surveyed, as well as gray and white marble wall decoration from Carrara (Italy). The Great Temple The west propylaeum was excavated. Here was a subterranean gallery (cryptoporticus), which contin- ued to the west and then turned to the south for 34 m into a double vaulted arch system. For structural support, under the west colonnade, was a massive east-west retaining wall built into a subterranean double arched arcade under the triple colonnade and the Lower Temenos. The most compelling arti- facts from the west propylaeum were a horned altar For further description of this sequence, see previous reports in Egan et al. 2000, 579-81; Harrison 1998. 2001] 451</page><page sequence="26">STEPHEN H. SAVAGE ET AL. Fig. 24. Petra Great Temple elephant-headed capital, 2000. (A.A.W.Joukowsky) and two limestone elephant-headed capitals in excellent condition (fig. 24). One capital adorned an engaged column, and the other, a west colon- nade column. After consolidation, these superb capitals were moved to the Petra Museum where they greet the visitor upon entry. A dramatic find was that the Upper Temenos southeast perimeter wall had been constructed against a sheer L-shaped scarp of bedrock, measur- ing 45 m long x 10-11 m high, creating a great paved east plaza. Carved in low relief in the bed- rock was a cult image resembling a sword deity emerging from an anvil-shaped block. It was proba- bly chiseled by the Nabataean stone masons as an act of contrition to the rock. The east corridor and east walkway were com- pletely defined. The Great Temple now measures 35.5 x 42.5 m east-west. It is the largest freestand- ing monument in Petra, covering 1507 m2 (fig. 25). Some fragmentary Latin inscriptions were cata- logued: P R O VI [NCIA] could be read on one. Other artifacts included ceramic figurines, Naba- taean bowls, an ostrakon fragment, an outsized mar- ble hand, bone pins, complete lamps (the majority were Nabataean), and 24 coins. The object databas- es served us well for the recording of all artifacts including architectural elements. Between excavation seasons, consolidation in 2000 has included the reerection of the south- west heart-shaped temple column, the theatron, the west corridor walls, and the southeast stairway. Restoration also continued on the west corridor murals, and bilingual signs were erected to iden- tify the major components of the Great Temple precinct. Petra. The Temple of the Winged Lions. Phillip C. Hammond (Hammondp@aol.com), David J. Johnson, and Lin J. Hammond report: The American Expedition to Petra has complet- ed its 18th season of excavations at the Temple of the Winged Lions in Petra. This is the longest series of excavations to have been conducted on the site, spanning some 25 years of research and excavations. Two principal areas were the focus of work at the Temple this season; site 11.8, at the northern end of the Temple, where erosion had resulted in consid- erable weakening of the balks, possibly compromis- ing visitor safety, and site III.10, at the southeast corner. With the removal of the balk in site 11.8, the east- west sectors of the site were separated, and excava- tion was undertaken in site 11.8 east. The removal of the balks wall lines in both 11.8 and 11.9 were clarified. All of the walls were double-coursed ashlar, although one, in site 11.8, showed the propensity of the Nabataeans to do poor construction in areas that would not be observable. In this case, the east- ern side of the wall was coursed with dressed ashlar, while the interior course, forming the inside wall of a room, was built of various combinations of ashlar and rough stone. Fragments of painted plaster re- covered in the room indicate how the deception was concealed. Similar Nabataean construction flaws have been reported elsewhere, and were even evident in the 1959 excavations of the city wall be- low the Conway High Place. The exposure of the walls in site 11.8 also clarified the floor plans of site 11.8 and 11.9. Since the A.D. 363 floors were not reached, the quantity of domestic materials recov- ered in this site was relatively scant compared to the amounts found elsewhere in the residential areas. However, a total of 35 registered items were recovered in whole and fragmentary forms. Excavation was carried out in site III.10 in order to remove further dump materials from the earlier excavations at the southeast corner of the Temple, to clarify the wall lines at that point, and to open the eastern side for presentation visibility from the paved street across Wadi Musa. At the northern end of the site, a massive pillar-like construction emerged, which abutted an adjacent north-south running wall, but seemed to have no functional relationship with it. The structure was built of well- cut dressed ashlar blocks, some measuring 0.6 x 0.66 m and 1.04 to 2 m in length, two courses wide, laid in alternating coursing. An opening, three courses high, was built into the north-south wall, probably serving as some type of drainage outlet. This opening contained a quan- tity of sherds, bone, eggshells, and partially intact pottery. Cobble and clay floors were encountered between walls. 452 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN Fig. 25. The Petra Great Temple, 2000, looking south. (A.A.W.Joukowsky) A total of 49 registered items were recovered in whole and fragmentary forms. The quantity of do- mestic materials that emerged from this site was in keeping with the chronology of the floors in that area below the earthquake falls. The presence of a high number of shells and beads, including a shell obviously cut for parts, indicates another activity of the residents of the Temple-jewelry making- whether for their own adornment or for commer- cial purposes. The expedition wishes to thank Dr. Fawwaz Al- Khraysheh, Director-General of the Department of Antiquities ofJordan, for his facilitation of the work of the season.

Bikai and Megan Perry, ACOR (acor@go.com.jo), report: Excavations were conducted from 1 April through 4 May 2000 in the two large buildings on the plateau below the Ridge Church. During the investigation of building 1, it was discovered that it is joined to building 2 by a doorway in the common wall between the buildings (fig. 26). A narrow stair- case drops 3.7 m from building 1 to the floor of building 2. At the bottom of the staircase, there is another door leading into the entrance hallway of building 2; this is the only entrance into the lower building. A small room is located to the south, di- rectly across from the entrance stair. A sounding in the room revealed that it had two successive layers of stone flooring. The western room of building 2, measuring 10.5 x 13.5 m, was also paved with stone. The very few artifacts and architectural elements in Fig. 26.

View from the northwest of the chancel area with the pulpit base in the foreground, Petra North Ridge Project this quarter gave no indication of its function. The eastern end of the building proved to be a small chapel. The interior of the chapel or church measures ca. 11 m north-south x 12.6 m east-west. It has a nave and two side aisles. Two columns (and two pilasters) stood on each side. The colonnade is the most spec- tacular part of the building. Each installation ap- pears to have consisted of a pedestal, a column base, three Egyptian granite drums, and a two-part Naba- taean capital. These appear to have carried arches, as dozens of voussoir stones were recovered. Of the 12 granite drums that would be required for this colonnade, 11 pieces were recovered at the site. Additionally, many parts of the capitals were recov- ered, and it is likely that they can be restored. The chancel, which was paved with both stone and reused marble pieces, was reached by three limestone steps, but only the lowermost of these is intact. Three of the four slots for altar posts were found in the pavement of the chancel. These were almost immediately in front of the apse. In the apse itself, a stone feature was found that appears to be the substructure for a throne (for the bishop?). Fi- nally, on the northern side of the chancel there was a pulpit (fig. 27). The substructure of the steps and the base for a six-sided ambo were found in situ. Additionally a displaced step that would have led up to the ambo, a number of blue marble open- work lattice fragments, and a post that may have been part of the ambo were found. No evidence of mosaics existed, either on the floor or the walls, in this structure. Plans are being made for the restora- tion of the chapel. Jabal Harun. Jaakko Frosdn (frosen@cc.hels- inki.fi) and Zbigniew T. Fiema, University of Hels- inki, report: The Finnish Jabal Harfin Project (FJHP), direct- ed byJaakko Fr6s6n and sponsored by the Universi- ty of Helsinki and the Academy of Finland, carried out its third fieldwork season from August to Sep- tember 2000. The personnel included 30 archae- ologists, cartographers, conservators, and students. The excavation site is a large, ruined architectural complex located on a plateau below the summit of the Mountain of Aaron (abal Harin) near Petra in southern Jordan. According to the Jewish, Chris- tian, and Islamic traditions, the mountain is the burial place of Aaron, Moses' brother. The 2000 excavations continued to expose the mono-apsidal, basilican church, the chapel, and other structures, all being the components of a Byzantine (fifth-sev- enth century A.D.) monastic/pilgrimage center dedicated to St. Aaron. The project's survey team continued its investigations in the environs ofJabal Harfn. The excavations exposed the west-central area of the church-a part of the nave in the early phase-that became an open, paved court in the later phase. The excavations of the apse revealed two rows of the synthronon and showed that the marble floor of the apse's interior was poorly pre- served. Inside the fully excavated south pastopho- rion, a stone-built, tomb-like installation was found. A storage function of this installation seems plausi- ble, at least during its later use. The interior of the western part of the chapel yielded numerous frag- Fig. 28.

Northern part of the mosaic floor located in the church's narthex,Jabal Hariun ments of painted wall plaster with geometric and floral designs; some Greek letters and words were also noted. The sounding inside the chapel re- vealed well preserved remains of a masonry-con- structed baptismal font of a cruciform type (fig. 28), which probably belongs to the earliest phase of oc- cupation there. The font was abandoned and back- filled, probably following the first destruction at the site. The font resembles one discovered in the Pe- tra church in 1996, and it is the second baptismal installation known from southern Jordan. Further studies were conducted on the mosaic floor discovered during the 1999 campaign and located in the church's narthex (fig. 29). Original- ly, the mosaic featured an almost symmetrical ar- rangement of zoomorphic and anthropomorphic designs on both sides of the central door to the basilica, a colorful border band of three intertwined bundles or chevrons, and some separate intricate geometric designs. Except for the chevron pattern, geometric designs, and the occasional fragments of human or animal bodies, the designs are not preserved since the mosaic was heavily altered by iconoclastic activities. The iconoclasts had removed not only almost all faces but also main parts of hu- man and animal bodies, and these were replaced with plain large-size tesserae. While the replace- ment was generally well-done, the removal was of- ten careless, thus the preserved details allow for an overall reconstruction. This kind of deliberate dam- age is generally dated to the eighth century (late Umayyad-early Abbasid period) and is known from other churches in Jordan and Palestine. A monumental structure forming a large, solid podium or high platform for an unknown super- structure was uncovered in the western part of the complex. This structure, probably Nabataean in date, was seemingly a component of either a large tower or a sacral building; however, its function during the Byzantine period is unknown. Farther east, a large, multiroomed structure of unknown function features a series of modifications and re- building. The archaeological survey, covering a total of ca. 1 km2, was conducted in the area southwest ofJabal Harfin and on its northern and northeastern slopes. Thirty major sites were recorded in the southwestern area, including more than 200 bar- rages and terrace walls (in clusters of several struc- tures per site). Six Middle and Late Paleolithic sites, including quarry sites, ridge sites, and mi- crolithic sites, were recorded. The team document- ed the remains of an ancient road from Wadi Araba through Abu Khusheiba to Petra and several small structure sites alongside the road. North and north- east ofJabal Harun, six sites were recorded, includ- ing a dwelling site dating to the Nabataean through Islamic periods. The FJHP 2000 fieldwork season provided a sub- stantial amount of information concerning the site 2001] 455</page><page sequence="30">STEPHEN H. SAVAGE ET AL. Fig. 30. E116, Area 104, detail of mosaic floor, Humayma and its environs. The general phasing scheme, that is, three major occupational phases of the basilica as developed after the 1999 campaign, was largely confirmed by the 2000 season's results. Also, it is increasingly apparent that the timespan of occupa- tion at the monastic/pilgrimage site may be safely extended into the late seventh century and proba- bly later. The next fieldwork season of the FJHP is scheduled for late summer 2001. Humayma. John P. Oleson (jpoleson@uvic.ca), University of Victoria, Erik de Bruijn, University of British Columbia, and M. Barbara Reeves, State University of New York, Buffalo, report: Excavation at the site of Humayma (also "Hume- ima," ancient Hawara) in 2000 focused on the Ro- man fort, a Late Roman habitation and cult area, and a bath building south of the fort. In addition, the last deposit of carved ivory panels was excavat- ed in the Abbasid manor house (F103). A regional survey of possible watchtowers was completed, and consolidation of structures and preparation for tourism continued. In the early second-century Roman fort (E116), excavation of the principia (headquarters building) revealed numerous statue bases or speaking podia within the portico on either side of the central room, and defined all four sides of the parade ground. A paved room abuts the principia to the north. A sub- stantial structure in the northwest quadrant of the fort, probably the praetorium (commander's resi- dence), proved to have mosaic floors made of large but colorful stone tesserae defining geometric pat- terns-the first mosaics found south of Petra (fig. 30). Some of the patterns are identical to those used in a first-century Nabataean villa at Wadi Musa. The praetorium was decorated as well with frescoes im- itating colored stone revetment panels, some of which carried Greek graffiti and Latin dipinti. Ex- cavations in the northeast quadrant uncovered a massive structure roofed with arches and paved with tiles, possibly a stable or granary. For the first time, terra-cotta water pipelines were found in the fort, tapping either the reservoir in its northwest corner or the Nabataean aqueduct. During the fourth cen- tury, some structures were altered for domestic ac- tivities and encroached on the south end of the via praetoria. Excavations outside the fort focused on fields E125 (Late Roman habitation area) and E077 (a Late Roman bath building). The third season of excavation at E125 revealed an insula-like structure containing over 20 rooms, probably comprising sev- eral discrete clusters of living and working areas sharing common walls. One of the areas functioned as a small shrine, which dates to the initial phase of occupation (late second to mid third century A.D.). Within the shrine were dedications reflecting both the presence of the Roman military (an altar dedi- cated by members of a vexillation of the Legio III Cyrenaica) and the survival of indigenous religious customs (a Dushara-type column). The presence of a Greek dedication to Serapis and the dedica- 456 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN tion of the legionary altar to Jupiter Ammon com- plement the many Egyptian artifacts found in the complex. A ceramic pipeline supplied aqueduct water for both religious and secular activities. The pipeline, traced along the eastern and northern perimeters of the building, proved useful both in defining the exterior limits of the insula, and in confirming the location of a Roman-period road- possibly the Via Nova Traiana. The shrine and oth- er portions of the complex were built on the care- fully constructed foundations of a dismantled Na- bataean building. The walls of a similar building underlie the bathhouse built by the Roman garri- son ca. 50 m to the west, suggesting that an early habitation area of Nabataean Hawara lies under the later Roman vicus. During the next two years the results of the Na- bataean and Roman period investigations will be prepared for final publication. A small team will return in 2001 to complete the excavation of the Early Islamic period manor house and mosque in which the Abbasid family plotted to overthrow the Umayyad Caliphate. The Roman Aqaba Project. S. Thomas Parker (thomas_parker@ncsu.edu), North Carolina State University, reports: The Roman Aqaba Project completed its fifth season at Aila, now within modern Aqaba on the Red Sea in Jordan. Founded by the Nabataeans in the first century B.C., Aila became an international port for commerce between the Roman empire and its eastern neighbors. The project is reconstruct- ing Aila's economy through excavation and a re- gional survey, completed in 1998. In 2000 excava- tion continued in six existing areas and one new area. Excavation continued in two mud brick domes- tic complexes founded around the turn of the first century A.D. near the northern edge of Aila. Both were briefly abandoned ca. 100 A.D., reoccupied early in the second century, and finally abandoned ca. 300. There was more evidence of a significant pottery industry somewhere in the vicinity in this period. Imported pottery included Eastern Sigilla- ta A and Nabataean fine wares. One complex was reused in the 4th century as a cemetery for simple pit burials. In most of the 13 excavated tombs, the individuals were oriented east-west, head to the west, facing south. The same orientation is apparent in a contem- porary cemetery (fig. 31) north of the Byzantine city wall. The 32 excavated tombs each contained a single articulated skeleton. Most were also aligned on the same orientation as the putative church just to the east. It now seems clear that the cemetery was founded in the late fourth century, shortly after the destruction of the putative church, and continued in use into the fifth century. Excavation revealed more of the plan of the mon- umental mudbrick structure. Recovered artifacts included a rectangular alabaster plate, African red slip pottery, fragmentary glass oil lamps, and sever- al hundred coins. The structure was erected ca. 300 and experienced three phases of use before its destruction, apparently in the earthquake of 363. The eastward orientation, plan, and artifactual evi- dence suggest that the building was a church. Just to the south is the Byzantine city wall, built in stone in the late fourth/early fifth century, and of which ca. 120 m is now exposed. Excavation thus far has exposed three rectangular towers project- ing from the outer face of the wall, which stands up to 4 m high. A large structure, presumably a ram- part, was added in the late sixth century along part of the inner face. It consisted of two elliptical mud brick towers connected by a mud brick wall, all erect- ed on stone foundations. Excavation within the city wall revealed stone and mudbrick structures of the Early Byzantine period (fourth and fifth centuries) along a street. Quanti- ties of imported fine wares, amphorae, and coins suggest the vibrancy of Aila's economy in this peri- od. Deep probes in several trenches reached sec- ond- to third-century strata, completing a continu- ous stratigraphic profile from the second through 10th centuries. The deep Umayyad and Abbasid strata in this area suggest that Byzantine Aila wit- nessed continued intensive occupation well into the Early Islamic period. One trench was opened to date the foundation of the city wall of Early Islamic Ayla, southeast of the project's excavation areas. The excavator (Donald Whitcomb) suggested a mid seventh-century date, Fig. 31. Two mud brick tombs with capping bricks still in situ from the cemetery just north of the Byzantine city wall, Aila. The tombs probably date to the late fourth-early fifth century. 2001] 457</page><page sequence="32">STEPHEN H. SAVAGE ET AL.

Other scholars had suggested that these fortifications might have been constructed in the Late Roman period (ca. 300) and reused in the Early Islamic period. A pump permitted excavation below the water table. Pottery from soil layers associated with the foundations dated to the seventh century, confirming Whit- comb's date. Aila's economy was based on international trade, but the city also hosted several industries, includ- ing pottery and metalworking. The payroll of a Ro- man legion and servicing the pilgrim traffic to Mount Sinai contributed to the economy in the Byzantine period. The evidence from the regional survey suggests that Aila was highly dependent on imported food and other resources throughout its history, although the population intensively exploit- ed local marine resources and fuels and probably grew some crops, such as dates. Qastal. The Umayyad Complex. Erin Addison, Qastal Conservation and Development Project (QCDP) (qcdp@nets.com.jo), reports: The Qastal Conservation and Development Project, under the direction of Dr. Erin Addison and Dr. Stefania Dodoni, has been working at the Umayyad period site at Qastal since June 1998. The project includes community and environmental development as well as archaeological and histori- cal research. [AJA 105 458</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN Fig. 33. Topographic map of the Tawahin es-Sukkar and Khirbet Sheik 'Isa, shown as a northwest oblique, based on the field season in 1999. The main stone-built structures and adobe walls at the Tawahin are depicted in black. The first 14 months onsite were primarily devot- ed to clearing the areas around the Umayyad qasr and mosque (fig. 32), which has been used for a decade as a waste dump. Despite this daunting task, some research goals were achieved; both qasr and mosque were documented and building phases established. Reexamination of the mosque yield- ed the most dramatic new evidence for the site. Conclusions regarding the mosque are detailed in a forthcoming article by Addison.6 Earlier scholarship claimed that the mihrab at Qastal was rectangular and "aligned with" Jerusa- lem, suggesting a dating to the reign of 'Abd al- Malik ibn Marwan. Physical and archival evidence show conclusively that the qibla wall with its mihrab is a 20th-century rebuild. The original qibla wall probably stood 2 m south of the present wall; thus the remains of the mihrab, if any exist at all, lie beneath the modern street that runs between the mosque and qasr. The qibla wall faces almost due south. The present prayer hall is probably a recon- struction of a Mamluk mosque. Important conclusions regarding the minaret at Qastal were reached. Mortar analysis and foun- 6Addison 2000. 2001] 459</page><page sequence="34">STEPHEN H. SAVAGE ET AL. dation probes confirm that the remains of the minaret are contemporary to the Umayyad qasr. Qastal's is thus the oldest purpose-built mina- ret still standing. The doorway to the interior spiral staircase has been cleared, and the lower courses of the original west wall of the mosque enclosure have been exposed to the exterior foundations. A firm date to the complex has not yet been assigned. Superficially the buildings resemble works constructed under the patronage of Walid ibn 'Abd al-Malik, especially Khirbet al-Minya in Tabariyyah. The fact that such a building as the qasr alone must have taken a decade to build sug- gests that its patron ruled for a significant period of time. Pottery finds and epigraphy confirm that use of the site continued throughout the Umayy- ad period, however, and into the Abbasid. Since summer 1999, work has been proceed- ing on the water systems at Qastal. Apart from the enormous central cistern (which has long been redeployed as a septic tank for the diwan Shibli al-Fayez), 19 related cisterns have been located and documented. Of these, eight are demonstra- bly part of the sophisticated water system associ- ated with the qasr. A network of water channels, pipes, and underground tunnels was laid before the qasr foundations were installed, and these are in turn connected to a roof catchment system built into the qasr walls. Remains of these roof- catchment pipes allow us to link securely the qasr, cisterns, channels, and foundations. In February 2000, Ra'ed Abu Ghazi, manager of the QCDP crew, discovered a new site 0.5 km west of the qasr. Splendid mosaics, comparable in quality, style, and subject to those at Khirbet al- Mafjar in Ariha, depict hunting scenes in intri- cately colored glass and stone mosaic. The quali- ty of the glass tesserae and ceramic evidence sug- gests a rather late date for the building, with oc- cupation continuing into the Abassid period. Fine gray marble column capitals link it to the decoration of the mosque, but a great deal re- mains to be done before anything more conclu- sive can be asserted. Tawahin es-Sukkar and Khirbet Sheik 'Isa. Effie Photos-Jones and Richard Jones (R.Jones@- archaeology.arts.gla.ac.uk), University of Glasgow, report: K.D. Politis reported briefly in 1999 on some observations at the 12-15th centuries A.D. sugar factory at Tawahin es-Sukkar and the neighbor- ing, related Byzantine and Medieval site of Khir- bet Sheik 'Isa in the Ghor es-Safi.7 Both sites are well known from surveys in the southern Ghor Valley. In 1999 the first phase of a new project took place that was to develop these earlier initi- atives with the aim of understanding more fully how the sugar factory operated. A collaboration between Glasgow University and K.D. Politis, and with the support of the DAJ, this project empha- sizes survey and laboratory-based analysis. Topo- graphic and geophysical (magnetometer) surveys were carried out at both sites, the former in 1999 (fig. 33) (areas A, B, and C refer to the geophysi- cal survey locations carried out in 1999), and the latter in 1999 and 2000. Area C was extended in 2000 to cover the whole of the mound at Khirbet Sheik 'Isa. The surveys at the Tawahin confirmed that there were at least two principal "industrial" ar- eas: the visible stone-built structures where the crushing/grinding of the sugar cane took place (the south end of the site in fig. 33), and the other, a waste dump, indirectly visible today, on the east side of the site where the sugar refining took place. A possible underground cistern and a 20 m stretch of underground canal were noted at the northern end, as was phasing in the visible stone-built structures. The surveys also showed the extent of structures within and around the Tawahin; some of these, such as the prominent arch at the northern end, may predate the facto- ry, while many of the adobe walls, for example, may postdate it. Many subsurface remains in area A (fig. 33) were detected, some of which relate to the factory. In the field to the immediate north of the site (area B), a similar palimpsest of an- cient and modern activities was evident in the geophysical data; some of the magnetic "hot spots" there should be indicative of industrial activity. Geophysical survey of Khirbet Sheik 'Isa showed that substantial building remains exist at the western end of the site where a stretch of the town wall has already been exposed by earlier excavation (area C). In the center of the mound and to its east, subsurface building remains were much less evident, perhaps because of damage from sporadic modern occupation and settlement and agricultural activities. Instead, encouraging evidence for industrial activity in the form of fur- 7 See Politis's summary in Egan and Bikai 1999, 518-20.

The program of laboratory-based work on the different classes of industrial waste, especially cinder and slag, the sugar pots, and building ma- terials is still in progress. A notable finding to date has been the identification of the light col- ored, lightweight cinder from the Tawahin as mainly gypsum, together with an as yet unidenti- fied organic component. The gypsum was proba- bly produced artificially either as a waste prod- uct of the sugar refining stage or the further pro- cessing of sugar waste after milling.
