<plain_text><page sequence="1">38 Great Lakes Review Lincoln, Twain, Certain Lesser Midwestern Poets, and the Civil War Rernard F. Engel Most wartime verse by Americans in the nineteenth century supported the sense of innocence that constantly renews itself in the national life. Neither stirrings of doubt during the wars with Mexico and Spain and in Vietnam nor the tearing of the national moral fabric by the Civil War made permanent change in Americans' sense of superiority, in their belief that America has achieved much of its supposed special mission. The American, indeed, continues to enjoy happiness as that quality is defined by Bertrand Russell - the sense that one has more joys than anyone else. Yet the Civil War did at least, for perhaps the only time in the national experience, give rise to profounder speculations than those that Americans have customarily engaged in. If it did not tear away the veil that, like the citizens of any society, Americans use to soften their perception of reality, it did at least let in a harsh light. In so doing it gave a few of the perceptive a view of the possibility that the cities of man are subject to forces more cosmic than the sociopolitical impulses of daily life. This deeper comprehension appears in the poetry of Whitman and Melville and in the lives of Abraham Lincoln and Mark Twain. Given the nation's religious and moralistic heritage, it is not surprising that even Americans of no defined credal affiliation - a category that includes Whitman, Melville, Lincoln, and Twain - used biblical stories and terminology in their thinking. In their understanding, the Civil War is not a moral crusade, a campaign of a virtuous North against a wicked South, but a venture that, no matter how right it may be in its immediate aims, is essentially wrong because the resort to arms violates the injunction "Thou shalt not kill." Whitman's most notable suggestion is in the poem "A Sight in Camp in the Daybreak Gray and Dim." The speaker, looking over the bodies of three soldiers brought to the hospital tent during the night, thinks to himself that one of them has "the face of the Christ himself," that "Dead and divine and brother of all . . . here again he lies." In bringing death to this young man, the nation has again killed Christ. And it has also repeated the crime of Cain against Abel, for it has slain the symbol of brotherhood, of the national community that rightful America is supposed to be. Whitman does not lay blame: the reader may deduce that the pot is as soot-covered as the kettle, that all of the nation, North as well as South, has resorted to arms; it is therefore all</page><page sequence="2">Great Lakes Review 39 of the nation that is guilty of these most dramatic of sins. Whatever social purpose the war may serve, it is itself an evil. Melville, too, looked beyond partisanship to appraise the use and result of war. In the poem "The Conflict of Convictions" the speaker foresees that what "The People" of the republic "will they bring to pass" - that their error is willed, not accidental, not forced on them by fate - and that the outcome of the war may bring power and strength to the nation "But the Founders' dream shall flee," the American age will be only "As age after age has been." I No Midwestern poet was able to free himself of the partisanship and to go beyond sociopolitical argument. Two sometime poets who demonstrated great comprehension, Abraham Lincoln and Mark Twain, turned out no verse related to the war. Yet it may be said of both men that they lived their poem of the war. In Lincoln, the Midwest produced a larger than life representation of an understanding that is pragmatically political and moral and is also expansive, profound, and tragic, a comprehension that is best termed esthetic. Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address is famous for the charity of its ending "With malice toward none." Less often noted is the earlier passage in which Lincoln puts his usual fatalistic leanings in Christian terms. Though observing pointedly the paradox that "any men should dare to ask a just Gods assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces," Lincoln does not exploit this argument against the southern position, but turns instead to the assertion that "The Almighty has his own purposes." He then quotes Mathew (18:7): "Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!" He suggests that slavery is "one of those offences which, in the providence of God, must needs come" but that "He now wills to remove." Something in the universe, it appears, demands that sin or error be committed, but the human beings who execute these crimes are nevertheless guilty and will deservedly suffer "woe." (Robert Penn Warren reads Lincoln to mean by "offence" not slavery, or not slavery alone, but "a communal involvement" in "all the unworthiness and blunderings of human nature."1 But Lincoln refers directly to slavery as "one of those offences" and, later in the same sentence, as "the offence.") Lincoln next turns to the argument that the ultimate sinner is not the South but the whole nation: God, he suggests, "gives to both North and South, this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offence came ..." Lincoln's view appears to be that the South is the immediate executor of the crime of slavery; but that both North and South are fundamentally guilty and are justly suffering the Civil War as punishment. The North, one deduces, has supported the national government that countenanced slavery and is therefore at the ultimate</page><page sequence="3">40 Great Lakes Review level as guilty as the South; moreover, the North shares equally with the South the guilt not of mere ineffable "blunderings" but of the murderous resort to arms - an action willed by God out of some universal necessity, perhaps, but, like slavery, nevertheless a punishable offense. Lincoln then declares resolve to fight the war - "if God wills that it continue" - with a determination that will, if necessary, do away with "all the wealth" unjustly accumulated because of slavery, and will avenge "every drop of blood drawn with the lash." Though its ultimate guilt is as profound as that of the South, the North is at least free from the immediate guilt of slavery, and therefore is appropriately God's agent charged with exacting the defeat of that sector which is guilty at both levels. Victory in the war will satisfy the demands of punishment. The phrase "with malice toward none" can be read as meaning not only that Lincoln would not punish the South, but also that he does not believe that either section should be goaded by the urgings of guilt. Even though God may have sent the Civil War as punishment to both the North and South, Lincoln seems to hold that suffering may come to man not as punishment - though that may be one reason for it - but as part of the order of things, from that "necessity" which, as he wrote in 1846, he had formerly argued for and that he still did not think inconsistent with Christian belief.2 Punishment therefore is not to be perpetuated by mere human decision: only if God should will it, a will Lincoln does not see as presently evident, should the North contemplate postwar punishment of the South. Lincoln spoke for the old order, for the America in which theology was still part of the vital core. Twain, the Midwestern writer most capable of a comprehension matching Lincoln's, was not yet mature in the 1860's, and he tended to see religion as a social institution open to questioning and ridicule rather than as a matter of grave philosophical import. Although Twain began publishing poems in the 1850s and wrote verse from time to time throughout his life, his poety contains only sparse allusion to Civil War circumstances. It may be that his newspaper work in the West during the war years kept him sufficiently occupied. Yet he wrote a little verse during those years. It seems possible that continuing research in his papers may yet turn up poems dealing with wartime issues. Certainly these issues were important to him, as any reader of Huckleberry Finn will realize. The great novel deals with events supposedly taking place in the 1840s, fifteen to twenty years before the Civil War. The fact that Twain published it in 1884 indicates that he understood the race issue and the nature of American life to be matters of permanent concern that were not in any way resolved by the war. Twain's part in the fighting was brief and uneventful. But he kept working over his account of it for at least ten years: however insignificant it appears to have been in reality, it clearly was of great</page><page sequence="4">Great Lakes Review 41 importance to his imaginative life, to his understanding of himself and his country. As was typical of his autobiographical observations, he gave differing accounts of the experience.3 The mundane version, the truth about Sam Clemens, was not interesting to him and, indeed, came out only when he was questioned by people who had heard or read the invented account, what might be styled the Mark Twain version. In actual fact young Sam, his career as a river pilot interrupted (ended, as it turned out) by the opening skirmishes of the war, joined with 14 other young men in Hannibal to form a Confederate group that called itself the Marion Rangers. All but three of the members of this rank happy militia cadre were elected or appointed as officers and NCOs: Twain was elected second lieutenant. The unit spent a couple weeks in desultory efforts at patrolling, giving more time to practicing horsemanship, singing around the campfire, and calling on young women. They had difficulty getting food, it rained a good bit, and they spent tiresome hours skittering to and fro because of unfounded rumors that Union forces were on the way. Sam was soon an unhappy soldier. He developed a boil, and he hurt his ankle jumping out of the hayloft when one of his fellow fighting-cocks set fire to the barn they were sleeping in. His first biographer, Albert Bigelow Paine, accepts the story that Sam spent "several weeks" in bed recovering, though it seems doubtful that a man of 25 would have needed any such period to recover from a twisted ankle. An any rate, young Sam, apparently confused about his sympathies, as were many Missourians, and tired of even the undisciplined life of a militiaman, went back to Keokuk to visit his brother Orion and then accompanied him west, thereby avoiding further military service. But the writer would not be satisfied with so merely literal a record. In a speech in 1877, Twain emphasized a fictitious danger to the cadre from U.S. Grant's forces;4 in reworking this material he included a fantasy that a man fired on by the "rangers" was General Grant himself.5 Neither of these exaggerations appears in the essay published in Century in December of 1885 as "The Private History of a Campaign that Failed." Further changes appear in the version Twain gave in a speech in 1887.6 In the most permanent record, the essay, the first several pages give a humorous report of the unit's skylarking. The account turns serious, however, when it tells of Twain and five others firing at a figure they take to be a Union soldier. As they watch the man bleed to death, they realize that he is a civilian, a stranger in the community. The effect of this invented incident is, as Twain reports it, emotionally strong. "The thought of him got to preying upon me every night," he writes. The mistake comes to seem "an epitome of war," a warning that "all war must be just that - the killing of strangers against whom you feel no personal animosity ..." The result is that "My campaign was spoiled. I resolved to retire from this avocation of sham and soldiership." Instead of developing the point, Twain turns to a joke at his own expense: he does not believe that his bullet was</page><page sequence="5">42 Great Lakes Review one of those responsible for the killing, "for in all my small experience with guns I have never hit anything I had tried to hit." Careful not to seem to make light of the war, he praises those who went on to fight valiantly. He even suggests a serious use for his story: it is "not valueless" because its picture of a militia camp in the first months of "the rebellion" is accurate (a deliberately sober ending, of course, meant to carry on what is in good part a con job). Twain presents the invented account as truth, and the unsuspecting may still be taken in by it. Are his several reworkings of the material to be seen as lies, as rationalizations of his failure to take part in what was for most men of his generation the adventure of a lifetime? A more understanding view is that Twain lived imaginatively in his persona, that the several invented accounts record a struggle toward understanding, toward arriving at a truer representation of emotion than the merely literal would give. Loyal to both the South and the Union, Clemens-Twain was quite unable to make up his mind. His later bitterness toward imperialistic wars of all sorts suggests that even in the 1860s he suspected that military endeavor is a grossly inadequate method of solving problems. He was approaching, at least, an understanding as profound as that of Lincoln. Though like the wartime president he speculated on "necessity," Twain by the 1890s would come to see not the hand of fate but the greed of man as the primary cause of war. Since that greed appears unquenchable, he was skeptical of Utopian hope. But in the era of U.S. imperialism he scorned and satirized and scolded: not God-ordained fate but human folly cultivates the roots of war. Meanwhile, not having the resource of theology to draw on, he approached understanding of the Civil War by combining the rational account of Sam the journalist with events from the fantasy life of Mark the fiction writer, events that would signify more than the humdrum fact. Why did he not draw on the lavishly available experiences of other men and the nation? Perhaps he believed that he could work out understanding of his own only by sticking to the terrain he knew best, the mind of Clemens-Twain. The writer whom William Dean Howells appropriately terms "the Lincoln of our literature" most deeply experienced the war not as Sam Clemens of Hannibal, sometime militiaman, but as Mark Twain, comprehending citizen of the universe. Lincoln lived his essentially romantic poem of the war; Twain was struggling toward experience of it as a Realist. II Though neither Lincoln nor Twain wrote poems on the Civil War, some hundreds of Midwestern versifiers did turn out war-related work, almost all of it rhyming lines in the domestic sentimental mode that prevailed in the popular writing of the time (as, with slight modifications, it prevails today in the popular fiction of movies and</page><page sequence="6">Great Lakes Review 43 television). William Dean Howells, John and Sarah Piatt, John Hay, Maurice Thompson, and Paul Dunbar are the best known of these writers today. For a brief consideration of characteristics of the Midwestern "mind" as represented in war-related verse, it can be useful to look at work by several lesser writers and at poems by Sarah Piatt, Thompson, and Dunbar. The most successful wartime poem by a Midwesterner, maintaining a Schoolbook longevity into at least the 1920s, was Thomas Buchanan Read's "Sheridan's Ride." Read (1822-72) was a portrait painter and poet from Pennsylvania who came to Cincinnati by flatboat in 1837 and lived by chiselling tombstones, painting signs, and other sub esthetic exertion until in 1841 a commission to paint the portrait of General William Henry Harrison, then a candidate for the presidency, won him national attention. During the Civil War Read was a major on the staff of General Lew Wallace, serving principally as a lecturer. He appeared on stage in Union camps, frequently with James Edward Murdoch (1811-1893), an actor who in the 1850s had bought a farm near Cincinnati that became his permanent home. Murdoch gave readings, often including Read's poems, intended to heighten military fervor, a purpose the Army in less noble times has sought to achieve by tantalizing the troops with well turned legs rather than with measured language. Read wrote "Sheridan's Ride" on October 31, 1864, and Murdoch read it that evening to a crowd at Pike's Opera House in Cincinnati. The piece was immediately popular. Bryant heard it read in New York on November 3, and declared "The poem will live as long as Lochinvar!" Read uses tetrameter measure in the manner of Scott's poem, but most of his lines are one or two syllables shorter than the 11-syllable line Scott uses. The effect of this shortening is to quicken the pace, but also to eliminate the similarity to medieval balladry that gives "Lochinvar" the effect of the familiar antique. The subject is an incident in the Shenandoah Valley on October 19, 1864. The Confederate general Jubal Early had advanced on Sheridan's positions at Cedar Creek. But Sheridan came galloping 14 miles from Winchester, rallying his fading troops along the way and turned back the attack. The pounding rhythm matches the warmth of Read's enthusiasm for Sheridan as the gallant savior of the cause, as the label "traitors" for southerners matches northern convictions. Readers apparently took in stride the poem's use of an anthropomorphic horse whose heart exults because it knows the urgency of its misison. (The horse as well as the general is also heroic in Melville's poem "Sheridan at Cedar Creek," one of the few wartime pieces by Melville to gain even moderate public attention. But Melville ends his celebration with recognition of the anonymity of the dead. As the funeral volley is fired, the speaker reflects on "the pathos deep," the</page><page sequence="7">44 Great Lakes Review fact that "There is glory for the brave" but "no knowledge in the grave / Where the nameless followers sleep." Other poets often wrote of wartime death, of course. But they wrote to glorify. Few Americans wanted to hear the suggestion that glory is meaningless to the ordinary soldier, and even fewer wanted to be told that the dead know nothing). As the victors often do,7 many in the North assumed that "reconciliation" of the sections would be easy, that southerners would accept defeat as a lesson and would humbly rejoin the interrupted drive toward the perfection of "liberty and Union" - the slogan of Americans in the War of 1812 that was often also heard in the 1860s. This expectation was most famously celebrated soon after the war in "The Blue and the Gray" (1867) by Francis Miles Finch (1827-1907) of Ohio. Finch wrote the poem after reading newspaper accounts of how the women of Corinth, Miss., while decorating graves of Confederate dead had also put flowers on the graves of Union soldiers. The sun, the rain, and glory come impartially, Finch writes; of the southern women he said: "They banish our anger forever / When they laurel the graves of our dead!" Popular appeal in the North no doubt came not only from the desire that hostilities be forgotten - few northerners realized that the South could not easily surrender its "cause" - but also from Finch's repeated pairing of the symbolic colors and other prettifying details in his graveyard scene, as in the varied refrain that in the third stanza, for example, reads: "Under the roses, the Blue; / Under the lillies, the Gray." Several organizations in both North and south professed desire for reconciliation, yet could seldom be accused of giving the dogs of war an uninterrupted sleep. Writing for the Union veterans in the Grand Army of the Republic, Kate Brownlee Sherwood (1841-1914) of Ohio truned out numerous odes and other celebrations of their wartime bravery and their postwar honor as patriarchal sages. Her collection Camp-Fire, Memorial Day, and Other Poems (Chicago: 1885) is full of exaggerated accounts of old battles and lachrymose pictures of parade turnouts dwindling as death takes the veterans one by one. Southerners were, of course, aware of northern feeling. Joel Chandler Harris, whose Uncle Remus tales are sometimes said to have helped restore good relations, was canny enough to alter his stories for northern readers. In the version of "A Story of the War" that appeared in the Atlanta Constitution, Uncle Remus is the loyal slave who saves his young master's life by killing a Union sniper. But in the book Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings, intended for a national audience, Uncle Remus only wounds the invader - who is then nursed back to health by Miss Sally, a southerner, and affirms reconciliation by staying on to marry her.8 Poets of domestic morality most often deal with the pathos of separation, whether of father or son from family, brother from brother, or lover from lover. Often the situation is that of relatives, one in gray</page><page sequence="8">Great Lakes Review 45 and the other in blue, who meet on the battlefield. The large number of such poems may seem to suggest that popular writers were taking this means to represent political separation. But there is rarely, if ever, any suggestion that the familial stands for the political. In the ethos of the time, the most important rending is not of the fabric of the nation but of the fabric of the family: the war's crudest effect, the one most likely to produce the desired emotion of pathos, is the breaking apart of the idealized domestic circle. Sarah T. Bolton (1841-1916) of Ohio is one of many to exploit the situation of brothers who take opposing sides. In "Left on the Battle field," Bolton has the brothers mortally wound each other, one outliving the other just long enough to identify him, cry out his anguish over the discovery, and recall their boyhood together. Wringing out of the situation all the tears she can, Bolton reports that the two were buried as found, clasped together. The reader is to see this post-mortem reunion as representing not a final rejoining of sundered North and South, but an ultimate reforging of the home circle. One poet who escapes some cliches of intrafamilial war is Sarah Piatt (1836-1919) of Ohio. In her version of the story, "One Brother's Hand," the Confederate finds his brother near death and nurses him back to health. Both live through the war, but in peacetime they quarrel over a woman. Piatt does not develop the irony that a twentieth century writer might perceive in this story; but she avoids the pathos and moralizing that her contemporaries would have found. The reader is free to make of the story whatever he or she wishes to find in it. Another capable woman, Constance Fenimore Woolson (1840-1894) of Ohio, primarily a writer of prose fiction, upends the cliches by contrasting not soldiers from the two sections but women from different moral conditions. An enthusiastic supporter of the Union cause, Woolson spent some months of the war in charge of a post office in an army hospital. But she makes no direct use of this experience in her three poems that deal with the Civil War. In Two Women, 1862 (1877) she comes close to breaking through the restrictions of the sentimental mode. The 87 pages of verse, most of them in pentameter couplets, contrast two women who are in love with the same wounded Union soldier. They discover each other on the train on the way to visit him. He dies without announcing his choice. The focus is not on the story, but on the contrast between "The Lady," a beautiful, sophisticated woman from Washington, D.C, and "The Maiden," a prim smalltown woman from the Midwest. In the work of most writers, the purpose of such a contrast was to highlight the virtue of the innocent by picturing the fascinating evil and deserved sad fate of the sophisticate. But in Two Women Woolson gives both women equal status and draws no moral conclusion. Because the sophisticate has a broader grasp of the circumstances and displays greater generosity, she is likely to seem, at least to the modern reader, the superior person.</page><page sequence="9">46 Great Lakes Review Although in appearance and most of her behavior "The Lady" is the wicked woman of Victorian story, in dealing with "The Maiden" she is humane and sensitive, displaying a comprehensive understanding that sets her several steps above the harridan-with-heart-of-gold found in the stories of Dickens and Harte. The poem is unusual for showing women both arguing and displaying generosity toward each other, and eventually making up their own minds about what to do with their lives. As a woman who knows what she is doing and takes the opportunities that come along, the only ones readily available to a member of her own gender whose tastes are cultivated beyond the ordinary, "The Lady" is close in spirit to Sister Carrie. And, like Carrie, she is not subject to the condemnation that moralism commonly demanded. Too much of the piece is declamatory and tearful, and both women display the spirit of self-sacrificing renunciation considered appropriate in the Victorian heroine. But at least Woolson accepts the possibility that there may be more than one acceptable moral stance. In their best poems, neither Piatt nor Woolson exploits sectional differences. One who finds virtues in the positions of both North and South is Maurice Thompson (1844-1901) of Indiana. Thompson was a Confederate veteran who moved north after the war and became well known as a novelist and nature-writer. He insisted on the spirited independence of the South within the Union and the honor of Confederate soldiers, but northern readers could accept his work because he admitted that the southern desire to preserve slavery had been wrong. Although he argued that southerners had fought to oppose invasion from the North, Thompson expressed adulation of Lincoln as one who sympathized with all humanity and represented heroically the cause of human freedom. The speaker in Thompson's poem "Lincoln's Grave" says that the president had a "Great heart that bled on every awful field," a set of "Deep eyes that wept for every soldier dead." He declares that Lincoln was "Born in the midway space where freedom seemed / To sport with slavery," halfway between the South and Plymouth rock: he was, that is, a representative American, his Kentucky birth and Illinois upbringing giving him national rather than merely sectional comprehension. The speaker goes farther: Lincoln was both "the Southern mother" and "New England's maiden," he was identical with the human hopes of both sections. Though "vicariously all suffering," he rose above the difficulties to defend the idea of freedom as well as to set the slaves feee. The speaker pauses to note that "other slaves" now "Delve, freeze and starve," for working people are in need of freedom almost as badly as slaves once were. But, he declares, the "whole world's aspirations" center "like the wind across the prairie grass" on this grave that is the altar of "Freedom's morning tide." In "To the South," Thompson urges southerners to "No longer sadly look behind" but to reflect that they "fought the good; but knew it</page><page sequence="10">Great Lakes Review 47 not," that at the time they believed their cause to be right. And he insists that no northerner full of "boreal vim" may tell the South how to behave: he remains proud that he fought "from Lookout to the sea," yet he is glad that the "Black Idol" of slavery was "Blown hellward" by the war and that the land of "Freedom" is now one, that "Our starry unity of stars" represents freedom all around the world - a notion suggesting that the turn from sectional to national feeling was a source of jingoism. It must be added that Thompson remained unreconstructed except for his agreement that slavery was wrong. The prose tales in his Stories of the Cherokee Hills (1898) concede that an occasional black may have talent, and Thompson encouraged Dunbar. But the tales picture slave life as idyllic, delcare the black's inferior status to be God's will and Nature's way, ridicule a white who allows a black to gain the upper hand, and praise blacks who "know their place." It remained for the first black poet to win a national reputation, Paul Laurence Dunbar (1872-1906) of Ohio, to question the war's purposes and its outcome. Most of Dunbar's handful of Civil War poems are in the domestic sentimental mold. They include short narratives in which black speakers enocurage their fellows, accounts of the effect of the war on black home life, salutes to the black troops who fought for the Union, and celebration of Lincoln. Four poems, however, raise questions. "The Colored Soldiers" reports the early determination to keep the war a white man's fight, the eventual decision to call on black men, the prowess of black soldiers "From the blazing breach of Wagner / To the plains of Olustee," and, observing that "they were comrades then and brothers," asks "Are they more or less today?" The writing is only that of the editorial in verse, but Dunbar is urging the point that Frederick Douglass had asked Lincoln to acknowledge, and that the president did eventually recognize. (In a letter to James Wadsworth, probably written in January of 1864, Lincoln says that black troops have "heroically vindicated their manhood" and thereby have "demonstrated in blood their right to the ballot." He adds that restoration of the Union "must rest upon the principle of civil and political equality of both races.")9 In "Speakin' at de Cou'thouse," a black man hears a white politician, advertised as a "conkerin' hero" of the Civil War, refight the war in his oratory and then, after talking of money and the tariff, say: .... de colah question, Hit was ovah, solved, an' done, Dat de dahky was his brothah, Each blessed mothah's son. Discretion keeps Dunbar from the sharply satirical. But though it is his practice to use "ah" for "r" in dialect poems, the emphasis in the</page><page sequence="11">48 Great Lakes Review quoted lines on words ending in "ah" seems intended to suggest the braying of a jackass. The poem ends, however, with only mild observation that there is another side to the story. The poem "To the South on Its New Slavery" is a troubled, almost bitter questioning: why doesn't the South, acting out of legitimate pride in its "loyal deed," recognize that blacks raised white children and toiled in the fields that made the region prosperous? Why doesn't it acknowledge this contribution by abandoning the hatred that is worse now than it was before the war? The speaker warns that while indulging in this hatred "A slumbering nation takes its dangerous ease." The most outright bitterness appears in "Robert Gould Shaw," speaking of the white colonel (1837-1863) who died while leading a black regiment in the assault on Fort Wagner, S.C. The speaker asks why Shaw left his studies "to lead th' unlettered and despised droves." It would have been better for him to have stayed with his books, "Since thou and those who with thee died for right / Have died, the Present teaches, but in vain!" Dunbar does not allow his verse to hope for the equality that Lincoln had suggested. But at least in a few poems reflecting on the Civil War he does speak out more strongly than the "mask" imposed on most of his work by late romantic proscriptions and pervasive racism ordinarily allowed. Ill Unlike Edmund Wilson, whose scouting of northern purposes in Patriotic Gore (1962) is cantankerous and misinformed, Dunbar has serious reason for dismay at the results of the Civil War. But those results, though incomplete, are important. Bringing an end to slavery was a genuine accomplishment. In doing nothing directly to end racism, the way may appear to have been a tragic failure. But the optimistic, at least, may see it as having begun a national commitment to human equality, to an eventual erasure of prejudiced discrimination based on race or creed. Like sermons, editorials, speeches, and novels, poetry reflected the "mind" of the times. Two principal representatives of that mind, both Midwesterners, wrote no verse dealing with the war. But Twain's development of a literary persona was an esthetic device, one that gave him a self enabling him to take in and develop a larger comprehension than Sam Clemens might ever have had. It is Mark, not Sam, who causes Huck Finn to determine on freeing Jim despite the teachings of home and society. And it is Mark, not Sam, who in the 1890s and early 1900s opposed the imperialism arising from moralistic patriotism. The noblest poetry of the war was, however, the life of Lincoln. The wartime president is often criticized for his political maneuvering and for his uncertainty about the future of black Americans. But maneuvering was a necessity for governing in a democratic society, and uncertainty wras a part of his temperament. A more certain and</page><page sequence="12">Great Lakes Review 49 dogmatic man, one less willing to live with ambivalences and even ambiguities, might well have made the war more bitter and divisive and might never have moved from the racist positions of the 1850s to the declarations of black rights and equality that Lincoln was making in the last two years of his life. Lincoln represented, indeed, the best aspect of the moralistic religiosity that too often restricted and repressed. His time in the White House was, he said, a period not of glory but of "ashes and dust."10 It was in the long run not only for himself but for the nation that he spoke when on the afternoon before his assassination he told of seeing ahead a destination that was a "dark and indefinite shore." To say that poetry led him to such a vision would be silly: Byron did not win the Civil War. But style and understanding are convolved. Lincoln's appreciative reading of poetry by Shakespeare, Burns, and Hood, as well as by Byron, and even his liking for William Knox's lugubrious poem "Oh Why Should the Spirit of Mortal Be Proud?" were important in shaping the style that contributed to his poetic understanding. War is not ever, one hopes, to be regarded as an acceptable method of solving problems. This, rather than simple failure of journalists, historians, and literary and other artists, no doubt underlies the observations of Whitman and Henry James, both of whom said that the real war will never get into the books. Westerners of the midcentury decades spoke of those who realized that dreams of riches and ease were fraudulent as having "seen the elephant," as having had childish hope trampled by hard, often bitter reality. It may be said that, in relation to war, Twain and Lincoln had seen the elephant. Twain became the angered skeptic who saw neither riches nor right in efforts to carry the flag to shores that belong to others. Lincoln remained hopeful but profoundly uncertain. Perhaps the shore that America is struggling toward is the land of equality that in his confident moments he envisioned. But as of 1983 the destination remains, indeed, dark and indefinite.
