COLLINS This is a review of two works : the first, a detailed account of the excavation of the Boyne Culture tomb of Barclodiad y Gawres in Anglesey;! and the second, a general survey of the chambered tombs of France.2 The Barclodiad book, which appeared some five years ago, is the report of a fairly complete excavation of a cruciform passage-grave in Anglesey. It is divided into two parts : the first, a descriptive account of the monument, prefaced by a consideration of its geographical setting; the second, a comparative study of the problems of its tomb structure and ritual and its mural art, with a consideration of the cultural and chronological setting of the tomb. The book is well produced; it is illustrated by line drawing plans, sections and examples of passage-grave art, with a generous number of photographs of details of the passage and chamber. Outstanding among the latter are the photographs by Prof. M. J. O'Kelly of the designs pecked on five of the orthostats?pecked so lightly indeed that to have achieved a good photographic record is no mean feat. Barclodiad y Gawres, "the apronfull of the giantess,'' was recognised by Grimes in 1936 as a site "probably akin to New Grange and other Irish sites." The plan, figured in the Anglesey volume of the Royal Commission on Ancient Monuments in Wales (1937, p. 98), showed the tops of a grouping of orthostats and one cap stone, approximately at the centre of a low circular mound. Such stones as were visible could be interpreted as the one side of a passage plus a main chamber with subsidiary chambers at one end and at one side of it. Complete excavation of passage and chambers and sectioning of the mound on two diameters, N-S (coinciding with the axis of the passage) and E-W, provided a fairly complete picture of both the passage-grave and the enclosing mound. The megalith had suffered severely from stone robbers who had robbed passage and chambers of all but one roofing slab and all but one of the orthostats forming the west wall of the passage; little that was essential was missing from the walls of the chambers. The resulting plan is that of an orthodox cruciform passage-grave. While this was, in a sense, only a confirmation of what some previous observers had suspected the site to be, the excavators made a most notable contribution by discovering pecked designs on five of the orthostats. The motifs employed comprised predominantly spirals, lozenges, a horizontal chevron band and a vertical zig-zag 'border pattern.' Perhaps the most interesting section of the book is the chapter on this art and its relations on the one hand to the other examples (mainly Irish) from the British Isles, and on the other to those of Iberia and France. The passage proved to have lacked any burial deposits. Very small quantities of cremated human bone were found in the southern end chamber and in the eastern side chamber. A larger quantity, identified as the remains of two individuals, both probably males, was scattered over the floor of the western side chamber; with these was a fragment of a bone or antler pin. The only other artifacts 1. Barclodiad y Gawres : the Excavation of a Megalithic Chambered Tomb in Anglesey by T. G. E. Powell and Glyn Daniel (Liverpool University Press, 1956). 2.

Their secondary position in the central chamber deprives them of any precise significance. More interesting than these sherds was the discovery of a hearth in the centre of the iloor of the main chamber. Analysis of the shell and bone fragments covering the charcoal showed a wide range of species of molluscs, fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals?interpreted as evidence of a special stew which was poured over the still glowing ashes of a fire. The second part of the book which tries to interpret the site and its art in terms of the European setting is of great interest. Analysis of the Barclodiad art is largely based on the combination of spiral and zig-zag elements in the same design. While the authors can shed no new light on the origin or significance of the spiral element and are in general agreement with Coffey's suggestion of a Mycenaean origin (G. Coffey, 1912, 70-7), they make an ingenious series of comparisons with other decorated stones in Ireland (Clear I., Drumreagh and New Grange), plus the Bryn Celli Ddu decorated stone (Anglesey), and Spanish and Portuguese examples of engraved and painted stones. Here, the authors appear to have schieved a tour de force by pursuing their comparisons through a wide range of designs some of which can with plausibility be accepted as human figures, presumably representations of the Mother Goddess which hark back to the clearly anthropomorphic phalange and cylinder idols of Almeria. Tenuous as is the link which unites the firmly-based Almerian anthropomorphism with the erratically conceived and apparently abstract designs of Ireland and Wales, I feel that the argument is sound. When on the topic of tomb art, I would point out that at Kirkoswald, Cumberland (R.S. Ferguson, 1895) there is another English example to add to that of the Calderstones, Liverpool (described by Mr. Forde-Johnson in a separate appendix). The Prehistoric Chamber Tombs of France is a beautifully produced book, well up to the standard which we have come to expect from the publishers. The type-face is excellent and the illustrations are on the whole well chosen and adequate; the latter include between 40 and 50 half-tones of megaliths, some half-dozen of megalithic art and about a dozen of grave-goods. To these are added 8 line-drawings of sites and 6 of finds reproduced from earlier works, plus (and this, in the reviewer's opinion, constitutes the main strength of the illustrations), a large series of distribution-maps, location maps, and site plans of over 130 sites, drawn by Mrs. Daniel; manv of the site plans are from new surveys. It is a great advantage to have within the compass of a single volume so many plans drawn pleasingly and with a uniform technique. One could, however, wish that the drawings had all been reproduced to a standard scale (or scales), a technique of presentation (cf. S. Pig-gott, 1954, passim) which so facilitates comparisons between sites. While the book is in general free from serious typographical errors, they are unfortunately numerous, often in the form of faulty figure references, in Chapter 5. I would like, too, to register a protest against the use of the term orthostat (p. 80) for horizontally-laid lintels ! The book is a form of interim survey based on work in the field, in the libraries and museums of France spread over the periods 1933-39 and 1947-60. It is professedly a survey with an ulterior motive : an attempt not only to present an</page><page sequence="3">10 A. E. P. Collins intelligible picture in space and time of the (variously estimated) four to six thousand chambered tombs of France, but to provide thus a background for megalithic studies in the British Isles. When Dr. Daniel began his researches before the war his task was indeed a vast one. Megaliths, like much of the material of French prehistory from the end of the Palaeolithic to Gallo-Roman times, had long been a neglected field; stratigraphy of deep deposits, like those of the Palaeolithic caves was generally absent. And so, regional and local differences in tomb architecture, domestic sites, stone tools and pottery types, instead of being seen as possible evidence for regional and cultural diversity were forced into a cultural sequence universally applicable (at least so far as France was concerned). For megaliths, the most that was done on a large scale was to list and map their totals department by department. This, as he shows, was done first by Bertrand in the last century and again by Dechelette in 1908. Yet if regional or national surveys were lacking or rudimentary, the sport of dolmen-digging (like that of barrow-digging in Britain) flourished exceedingly in the 19th century; large numbers of sites were "excavated" and the results, when published, appeared in the pages of local journals. Conditions improved somewhat during the early decades of this century with better excavations of some monuments and the preparation of regional surveys like the work of Zacharie le Rouzic in Morbihan and that of Coutil and Doranlo in Normandy. Since the 1939-45 war, however, French prehistorians have become increasingly aware of their heritage of megalithic monuments and work of a high standard has been published in large quantity, especially by Giot and L'Helgouach on Breton sites and by Dr. Arnal and his associates in south central France, mainly the He&gt;ault. Dr. Daniel has thus, especially in the last few years, been able to draw on a growing body of good local work. While his own interpretations of the evidence are sometimes at variance with those of his current French colleagues, he readily acknowledges his debt to them. An introduction and a preliminary historical chapter on megalithic research in France preface a descriptive account of the tombs which is subdivided regionally into eight chapters. A concluding chapter attempts a general interpretation in terms of types, origins, chronology, etc., summarising the evidence and trying to show its relevance to the tombs of the British Isles. An extensive bibliography (which, however, does not include all the works cited in the text) and a list of major sites conclude the book. The Prehistoric Chamber Tombs of France is in effect a summary, subdivided on a regional basis of the salient features of tomb-types and their distribution throughout France. Some of the evidence contained in it has already appeared in previous works by the author. The French gallery-graves, for instance, have already been treated as a class (G. E. Daniel, 1956) and the main arguments of the whole book have appeared in summary form in a later work (G. E. Daniel, 1958). Needless to say, in the present work the treatment is far fuller. The evidence is summarised to present as balanced a picture of distribution patterns as could well be achieved at the present. Stress is laid throughout on geographical factors affecting distribution. Thus, the significance of rivers as means of access to the interior is well brought out in the maps (figs. 8 and 15) showing the Paris Basin gallery-graves and the Lower Normandy passage-graves. Again, we are</page><page sequence="4">Chambered Tombs in Detail and in the Mass 11 leminded of changes in the physical geography ot certain regions since megalithic times?changes which must be borne in mind when considering distributions : famous island sites like He Longue and Gavrinis in the Gulf of Morbihan were probably just slight hillocks rising from low-lying coastlands which were subsequently inundated; conversely, megalith-free areas of low ground on the map between the mouths ot the Loire and the Gironde, now given over to market-gardening, were probably areas of salt-marsh or lagoon, subsequently filled-in by deposition by longshore drift. In the south, the two small hills on which are sited the famous Arles-Fontvielle tombs were probably islands when the tombs were constructed. The objective reality of the passage-grave/gallery-grave dichotomy is clearly borne out by the distribution pattern when the whole country ot France is considered. As a rule the passage-graves are concentrated in the south (Herault) and to the north-west of a line from the Gironde to Havre. The passage-graves are almost exclusively coastal, whereas the gallery-graves are fairly evenly distributed. Even in regions of genuine overlap, like Brittany, the passage-graves are still coastal, whereas the gallery-graves are widespread. Turning to origins and dating, both groups of passage-graves are held to derive from southern Spain. The gallery-graves are a more complex problem. Those of the south are thought to be derivatives from the Arles-Fontvielle tombs; from this primary centre gallery-grave builders may have spread over much of south-western and western France through the Narbonne-Carcassonne gap. The gallery-graves of Brittany and the Paris Basin tombs may be traced ultimately to the same source, though other alternatives including independent development from V-shaped passage graves in Brittany or even a sea-borne entry via the western sea-ways of gallery-graves developed by a similar process in southern Iberia are considered. Daniel favours the last explanation for the Paris Basin group, the sea-borne origin thus demanded agreeing well with the location of the tombs along the Seine and its tributaries. The typological and geographical aspects of the study are inevitably the soundest parts of the book. When we turn to dating, the evidence is of too uncertain a nature for precise reasoning. The author is, in a sense, unfortunate in his publica tion date. As could be seen from various of his earlier writings, he hankers after a relatively short chronology for Neolithic and Bronze Age Europe. Yet the book has appeared at a time when C-ll dates Tor French megalithic and other relevant sites of about 3,000 b.c. are beginning to appear. Prominent among these is a date of 3,030 b.c. (s.d. 75) for the Breton passage-grave of He Carn (P. R. Giot, 1960, 54). A salutary warning to all constructors of typological sequences is provided by the Barnenez South multiple passage-grave barrow excavated by Giot in north Erittany and summarised here for us: the eleven passage-graves, all broadly contemporary, show many permutations and combinations of dry-walling, orthostat walling, corbelled vaulting and capstone roofing; any "neat" or "logical" scheme of development from rock-cut chamber through ihoJos to orthostat-and-lintel construction, however attractive as a piece of theorising, has been shown thereby to be not necessarily applicable in all cases and to be unworthy of consideration unless supported by independent dating evidence.</page><page sequence="5">V2 A. E. P. Collins Dr. Daniel's treatment o? the question of whether the French megaliths are "Neolithic" or "Bronze Age" is worthy of consideration as a piece of archaeological philosophy. To him it is an unreal question to which no answer need be attempted. It is for him a useless survival from the days of the "three age" division of prehistory. If these terms have value at all it is purely descriptive of the technological stage reached by the tomb builders. He would preter a historical treatment which give answers to questions such as: what kind of economy and society did the builders of individual tombs or groups of tombs possess and when and how did tney live in a particular locality and build their tombs there? Here we may add that interpretation of our Irish prehistory in terms of the time-honoured "Neolithic-Bronze Age" succession has for long been difficult (ci\ S. P. O'Riordain, 1946, 146). If we persist in applying it we may even find ourselves in difficulties similar to those of our French colleagues who are now (cf. P. R. Giot, 1960, chapters 3-5) seeing the past in terms of a "Neolithic period into the middle of which was injected a knowledge of metallurgy and which was only terminated by a second introduction of the same kind." Most of the largest and most complex tombs which would be potentially of the most significance have either been open to all comers for centuries or were badly dug in the last century. The fact that these tombs were "collective" and with a few exceptions like, St. Michel and Mane-er-Hroeck in Brittany, "open" tombs has meant that the contained grave-goods present an often hopelessly jumbled mass of material, reflecting many centuries of use of the tomb, even extending down to re-use in Gallo-Roman times. It is presumably too much to hope that re-excavation by modern methods will be as fortunate with any of these tombs as was the recent re-excavation of the West Kennet long barrow in Wiltshire (S. Piggott, 1958). Nevertheless it could be argued that what the grave-goods lack in terms of precise stratigraphy and association has been made up in terms of abundance. The objects found are, by the standards of the British Isles, staggering in both quantity and richness. Certain categories of grave-goods such as "classic" bell-beakers and faience beads can be employed for dating. Others, including the various forms of channelled pottery are shown to have had too long a period of currency to be of similar value. The distribution map of French beakers is striking in its coincidence with that of the megaliths and a case is made for linking trade in localised materials such as Grand Pressigny flint, calla'is and gold, with Beaker trading activity. From the foregoing summaries it will be apparent that both these books are of the greatest interest to Irish prehistorians. Barclodiad y Gawres has been given a more exhaustive and sumptuously produced report than any single tomb the writer can recall. In these days of excessively high costs of book production one might almost think that the book erred on the side of luxury. Yet as a result of this exhaustive treatment it would appear that the site has been made to yield the ultimate in information. Barclodiad is indeed a worthy companion to Bryn Celli Ddu in Anglesey and the reports of these two Welsh sites will take their place in passage-grave literature alongside those of the Irish Fourknocks I. While the main concentration of the cruciform type passage-graves is still to be found in cast-central Ireland, if one accepts the authors' arguments (based mainly on an analysis of the art) it would follow that a limited colonisation of</page><page sequence="6">Chambered Tombs in Detail and in the Mass 13 \nglesey was part of the initial spread of Boyne tomb builders to the British Isles. Turning- to points of detail, it is good to find the Drumreagh (Co. Down) decorated stone given a place in the analysis of chevron-bordered figures deemed to be anthropomorphic. It is a pity, however, that the authors seem to have overlooked the numerous examples of Bo\ne-type art, rudimentary though many of them may be, in the Millin Bay cairn, Co. Down (A. E. P. Collins and D. M. Waterman, 1955). In matters of cairn structure and inferred ritual a few further Irish comparisons may be made. The fact that no sockets for orthostats for the west side of the cuspidal forecourt at Barclodiad were found need not argue for the original absence of such stones; excavation of the forecourt of Edenmore long cairn, Co. Down, showed that such stones need not be bedded in sockets at all (A. E. P. Collins, 1959, 30). Stone 12 at Barclodiad, an orthostat set radially between the end chamber and the east side chamber perhaps finds a parallel at Knockmany, Co. Tyrone (A. E. P. Collins and D. M. Waterman, 1952, Fig. 2) where stones 5, 7 and 9 appear to be used almost as buttresses to the chamber. The fire in the central chamber with its weird assortment of animal remains may perhaps be compared with the fire in Chamber 3 at the Audleystown, Co. Down, long cairn (A. E. P. Collins, 1954, 18). The Preliisloric Chamber Tombs of France is essential to any student of our Irish megaliths. Most of the original excavation and survey reports on which it is based are scattered through relatively obscure local French journals which are hard to come by in Ireland. We can be grateful to the author for saving us so much time in an often fruitless search for them. Yet if these remarks imply that the book is no more than a condensation or compilation of the works of others, we do its author scant justice. He has almost certainly a wider first-hand familiarity with the megaliths of all Europe than anyone else alive and this broad knowledge has enabled him to bring a sense of balance and perspective to the French material which few, if any French authors have been in a position to do. While the various regions into which he has divided the country are inevitably treated unevenly we can feel fairly sure that we are presented here with as good a summary as is possible of what is available. For at least a generation British and Irish prehistorians have been casting their eyes towards France, aware in a general way both of its mcgalithic riches and of the role that France as the nearest part of western Europe to these islands must have played in colonising them. The megalithic wealth of Brittany, especially the Morbihan, had been well known. Between the wars, Daryll Forde's studies of the Breton tombs and Dr. Daniel's own discovery of "Transepted gallery-graves" in Morbihan and Loire Atlantique began to give precision to these vague musings. The work under review treats all the major groupings of French megaliths suffi ciently for us either (if we wish) to accept the author's own views on the French parentage of various of our major groupings of megaliths or (an unlikely event) to produce our own alternative theories. In brief, Dr. Daniel's view is that our Boyne Culture passage-graves probably owe little or nothing to France but are due to direct colonisation by sea from south Portugal?in fact a parallel move to the settlement of Brittany by passage-grave</page><page sequence="7">14 A. E. P. Collins builders. Our Tramore-Scilly entrance-graves he sees as a subsequent colonising movement from Brittany and the Channel Islands. He says, in fact, that "it is little more than 100 miles from the coasts of Finistere to the Lizard and about 150 from the Isles of Scilly to County Waterford." Yet as I copy these words from Dr. Daniel's text, safe in the writing room of a 17,000vton liner, with the Ushant light house winking to starboard, I can feel nothing but respect for these early megalith-building navigators who attempted these same 100 miles of far from calm sea in their frail boats. Turning to gallery-graves, he is easily able to dissociate our Clyde-Carlingford cairns from the "horned cairns" of Sardinia. He equally can find no plausible prototype in the Pyrenaean or south French cists and galleries, despite the fact that these occasionally show segmentation by jamb-stones. He is more inclined to see the Clyde-Carlingford cairns as an oif-shoot within the British Isles from the Severn Cotswold long cairns which he would derive from the west French transepted gallery-graves. The trapezoid or truncated wedge plan seen in some of the Clyde-Carlingford cairns (e.g. Audleystown, Co. Down; Browndod, Co. Antrim; or Creevykeel, Co. Sligo), as also in the Severn Cotswold group, he would see as a Severn-Cotswold borrowing from the unchambered long barrows of the Windmill Hill Culture of south-east England (a barrow-type with probable east European antecedents, cf. S. Piggott, 1955). One common Irish form of tomb on which he preserves a discreet silence is our wedge-shaped gallery-grave which in a previous book (G. E. Daniel, 1958, 116-7) he was willing to see as related to some of the west French gallery-graves. It is interesting to speculate on what changes further work will bring to these theorisings on the interrelationships of megalith-groups and the movements of their builders. It is at once clear that increasing numbers of C-14 dates for megaliths stand the best chance of confirming or modifying them. It may well be that a chronology more extended than Dr. Daniel would now subscribe to will emerge, but the major effect of this will be to extend the periods of time during which the various megalith types were current. Thus it may be that the He Carn passage-grave of c. .3,000 b.c. and the Mound of the Hostages passage grave, Tara, of c 2,000 b.c. (W. A. Watts, 1960, 114) point to a thousand years of passage-grave building in north-western Europe. Though admittedly we have as yet far too few C-14 dates for megaliths or for probably contemporary domestic sites for any certainty in such matters, the general trend of C-14 dating in northern and western Europe has been towards an extension backwards in time for the inception first of "Neolithic" agricultural settlements and second for the beginnings of megalithic tomb architecture. If this is confirmed by further work, we shall, of course, have to spread a given number of tombs over many more centuries with consequent modifications to current estimates of population densities and the rates at which populations either migrated or grew in numbers.
