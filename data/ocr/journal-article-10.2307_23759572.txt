News and Notes A new archaeological muséum on Santa Barbara, Peten Graz (Karl Herbert Mayer). In the early summer of 2003 a new private archaeological muséum was inaugurated on a small island in the large lake of Peten Itza, near Flores, the capital of the Department of Peten in Guatemala. The island, officially known as Islote Santa Barbara, is locally also known simply as „Radio Peten" because of the tall antennae of a local radio station. The small but rich muséum with numerous objects of the Maya culture was formerly estab lished, but never accessible to the public, in the Guatemalan town of Melchor de Meneos in the Northeastern Peten, very close to the national border to Belize. The founder of the private collection, Juan Emilio Colmenares González, moved his extensive collection, which was obviously collected pri marily around Melchor de Meneos, finally to the island of Santa Barbara. This collection is officially named Museo Arqueológico Santa Bárbara and is open to the public. The entrance fee is presently 5 quetzales. The collection has been recently registered officially by the Guatemalan authorities, namely the.Instituto de Antropología e Historia, according to written documents kept in the muséum. The artefacts on display encompass a variety of archaeo logical objects made of limestone, clay, shell, bone, and obsidian, dating to différent time periods. With regard to major limestone sculptures, the muséum contains three im portant examples, namely a stela fragment, a carved panel, and an incised capstone. The stela fragment is of unknown place of origin and consists of the fragmentary centre section of a stela, showing on the front surface part of a standing human figure in frontal view, with an ornamented belt on top and reaching down with a knotted belt ornament below, almost to the height of the knees of the portrayed dignitary. To the left of the broken fragment are the carved remains of three glyph-blocks, ar ranged vertically (Figs. 1, 2). On the back section of the fragment is an incomplète Late Classic period hieroglyphic Fig. 2.

The theft of a Classic Maya jade figurine that had been shown in a temporary exhibit in the Museo de la Antigua Casa Presidencial in Tegucigalpa has been reported by the authorities of the Instituto Hondureño de Antropología e Historia (IHAH) and the Ministerio de Cultura, Artes y Deportes in October 2004. The figurine was discovered in 2001 during excavations at Copan directed by the Japanese archaeologist Seiichi Nakamura. It is carved from jade and shows the Maya Maize God. The specimen is 5.4 cm high, 4.5 cm wide, 2.3 cm thick and weighs 66 grams. Honduran archaeologist Ricardo Agurcia fears that the piece, which was stolen on September 14, 2004, has been taken out of Honduras to enter the internationally operating illegal art market. Archaeological Park of Tazumal closed San Salvador (Reuters/EFE). On October 19, 2004 the authorities of the Salvadorian Departamento de Arqueología del Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y el Arte (CONCULT URA) announced the closing of the archaeological park of Tazumal to the public after a wall 23 m long and 7 m high at the south side of Structure 2 collapsed the day before. Heavy rains had caused the filtration of water via fractures in the structure and finally brought about its collapse. To prevent further damage, the remaining part of the structure as well as other structures at the site will be examined. Tazumal, which is located approximately 80 km to the west of San Salvador, is one of El Salvador's most important archaeological sites. Order of the Quetzal to Michael D.
