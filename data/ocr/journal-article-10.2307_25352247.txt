<plain_text><page sequence="1">Correspondence Migraine and Intracranial Pressure Sir,?The question of whether or not intracranial fluid retention is responsible for the symptoms of migraine led 1 to an interesting correspondence in several of your issues following the publication of an article on the treatment of migraine by Dr. Macdonald Critchley in the issue of October 26th, 1935, as well as the reference by Dr. Barber to my contributions in the issue of November 2nd, 1935. The finding of Dr. Critchley, as quoted by Dr. Douthwaite (December 7th, 1935), that a constant change in an attack of migraine is a fall of cerebro-spinal fluid pressure, is in contradiction with the observations of Sicard, Claude, Mingazzitii, and others, who find increased pressure during * the attack. While this question is thus apparently still sub judice, one may, for the sake of argument, accept the presence of low cerebro-spinal fluid pressure in an attack as an established fact. The contention of Dr. Douth waite, however, that " if the brain were swollen by virtue of oedema, the reverse were true "?that is to say, that there should be an increased cerebro-spinal fluid pressure? cannot even then be subscribed to. In addition to the penetrative remarks of Sir Leonard Hill, as quoted by Dr. Auld (December 14th, 1935), the following observations and considerations indicate the presence, or at least admit the possibility, of intracranial fluid accumulation in migraine, in spite of low cerebro-spinal pressure. Cushing observed that attacks of migraine are at times associated with choked disk. Subtemporal decompression not only resulted in a considerable measure of relief in most cases, but also afforded opportunity to note that, when subsequent headaches occurred in these patients, *the increased intracranial tension was shown by a tendency to protrusion at the seat of the defect, which became flat again, or even receded, with the free interval. Retino scopical observations, such as described by Dr. Preston in your issue of December 21st, 1935, also indicate increased intracranial pressure during the attack. The fact that in the presence of increased intracranial tension normal or even subnormal cerebro-spinal fluid pressure may be found, and that no contradiction exists in this com bination of findings, was already known by Quincke. This occurrence was attributed and considered by him a symp tom of disturbed communication between the cerebral and spinal subarachnoideal spaces. Fay finds also that the volume of the brain, and thus the intracranial tension, may increase without increased cerebro-spinal fluid pressure. His explanation is that sufficient venous and arterial blood, along with certain amounts of cerebro spinal fluid, may have been squeezed out to make way for the volume plus. It was he who offered the most direct proof, having " observed on several occasions existing oedema of the brain in the presence of dehydrations to the point of emaciation in other structures, as well as complete drainage in the cerebro-spinal fluid system." But in addition to the theories of Quincke, Hill, and Fay, con sideration should be given to yet another mechanism of the phenomenon under discussion; This is the production of cerebro-spinal fluid in diminished amounts due to, increased retention and decreased release of fluids in the brain, similar to certain cases of generalized oedema of the body?as, for instance, in nephrosis, where an oliguria may exist on account of liquids being freed with difficulty. If I am permitted to use a more picturesque term, and at the same time ask the reader to disregard its chemical (and anthropomorphic) implications, it can be said that the increased " affinity " of the brain tissue to liquids may prevent the formation of normal amounts of cerebro-spinal fluid, thus accounting for the low pressure as measured</page><page sequence="2">720 Aran. 4, 1936 CORRESPONDENCE ^fitlS?At by means of spinal puncture. In this occurrence one might, if one wishes to, see a " defence mechanism " which prevents a further increase of intracranial pressure. The latter should result if the production of the cerebro spinal fluid continues at an undiminished rate while the volume of the brain is increased. In -view of these facts and considerations, the question presents itself as to why in certain cases of intracranial fluid accumulation (irrespective of whether or not migrainous in origin) the pressure of cerebro-spinal fluid is high rather than low or normal. Instead of going into a detailed discussion of this problem, which is not pertinent at this time, I may be permitted to illustrate it by refer ring to occurrences which are analogous and better under stood. I have called attention to the possibility that the oedema of the brain itself may be the cause of diminished cerebro-spinal fluid production, in the same way that occurs in certain cases of generalized oedema of the body when an oliguria follows as a consequence. Similar, how ever, to occurrences in other cases where generalized oedema may coexist with polyuria rather than oliguria? such as, for instance, in the so-called hunger oedema of the late and other wars?it is conceivable that swellings of the brain may exist simultaneously with a normal or increased production of the cerebro-spinal fluid. It is not impossible that whether a case of migraine belongs to the " retentional " or the " mobilizational " group would create a difference in the cerebro-spinal fluid production, as suggested by Dr. Auld, though only further investiga tions can throw light on this problem, as well as the others previously touched upon. Returning once more to the findings of Critchley, it should be mentioned that to such an extent is he carried away by the low readings he obtained of the cerebro-spinal fluid pressure during attacks of migraine that he attributes a pathogenic significance in the development of the attacks' to a low rather than a high intracranial tension. While the presence, or at least the possibility, of increased intra cranial tension seems to have been demonstrated by the observations and considerations that I enumerate, the lack of tenability of Critchley's contention and the part played by high intracranial tension in the development of attacks of migraine are illustrated by the question which he himself raises. He remarks that in spite of the pathogenic role which he attributes to low intracranial tension, pains in attacks of migraine are not necessarily relieved by measures elevating intracranial tension. He continues with the observation that inhalation of amyl nitrite promptly produces a well-marked rise in intracranial tension, but fails entirely to assuage the headache. I will add at this point that not only does inhalation of amyl nitrite or administration of the pharmacologically closely related nitroglycerin leave headaches unrelieved where these exist, but both may lead to their development where they had been absent previously. In not a few cases in which I administered amyl nitrite or nitroglycerin in angina pectoris, they have led to such serious head aches that the administration of these had to be dis continued. There were patients who preferred to suffer the pains of angina pectoris * rather than the headaches.? I am, etc., New York City, March 12th. EUGENE F?LDES.</page></plain_text>
