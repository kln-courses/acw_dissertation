<plain_text><page sequence="1">GERMAN PHILOSOPHY DURING THE YEARS I896-i898. II. III. PSYCHOLOGY AND EPISTEMOLOGY. In logic, there is no work that here deserves special mention. But the more numerous, on the other hand, are books on psychology, writ- ten from very different standpoints, and representing very diverse methods. The first place must undoubtedly be given to H. Ebbinghaus's Grundziige der Psychlo/ogle. Unfortunately, only the first half of the first volume has so far appeared (Leipzig, Veit u. Co., i897-pp. 320). The second half, also, was to have been published in the year i897, but it has as yet been withheld. The whole is to be about four times as large as the part which has appeared. If it realizes what the be- ginning promises, we shall be indebted to Ebbinghaus for by far the best of all contemporary expositions of psychology in general. Be- sides a complete mastery of the material, a chief feature of the work is the unusual clearness and vividness of the style, and the systematic de- velopment of the thought. The most difficult problems, and most in- volved relations, are developed and set forth with an ease which is remarkable, inasmuch as the difficulties are not at all evaded or set aside. The first book treats of such general questions, as the stand- point and method of psychology, mind and body, the conscious and the unconscious. Ebbinghaus is a supporter of the theory of psycho- physical parallelism. By 'mind,' he understands, not a special, indi- visible, simple essence, but an uniquely organized totality, a self-depen- dent system of numerous, closely associated, and manifoldly related, conscious realities. In the second book, Ebbinghaus expounds the structure and functions of the nervous system. With a fine discrimina- tion, he here selects out of the enormous field only that which is in- dispensable and of interest for psychologists; and this mass of material, which is still large even after the selection, is most skillfully systematized and grouped around a number of important points. In the third book, we become acquainted with the simplest psychical pro- cesses, among which Ebbinghaus distinguishes three sorts: sensations, ideas (of imagination), and feelings. The present half-volume deals only with the sensations of sight and hearing-but the treatment is that of a master. Ebbinghaus has no intention of restricting the book to the experimental part of psychology. He proposes rather to in-</page><page sequence="2">No. 4.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY 387 elude the entire life of individual consciousness, from its lowest to its highest manifestations. It is hoped that the next report will be able to announce a real advance in the execution of this great plan. Fr. Jodl's Leehrbuc/ der ]Psyclologie (Stuttgart, J. G. Cotta, i896. -pp. 767) brings together a large amount of material in a relatively small space. The exposition is, as Jodl himself says, " condensed and sometimes very abstract," but, nevertheless, thoroughly intel- ligible. The work has arisen out of the needs of university instruc- tion, and is primarily intended for teaching purposes. Its aim is to embrace the entire field of contemporary psychology, including the results of experimental investigation. In the briefer part of the book, devoted to general questions (pp. i-i 66), Jodl discusses the problem and method of psychology, the relation between body and mind, and gives a description and systematic arrangement of the phenomena of consciousness in general. The second and special part deals in detail with the particular phenomena, and here two principles of classifica- tion cross each other. The fundamental functions of consciousness are sensation (ideation, thought), feeling, and will. In all three, never- theless, there are to be distinguished, according to the development of consciousness, three stages, which Jodl characterizes as primary, secondary, and tertiary. The processes of the second stage are only " images of previous states immediately aroused" (Hume's ' ideas of impressions '). The third stage presupposes the other two. Here we have " the highest product of consciousness, which no longer consists of images in manifold connection, but of blendings and fusions of the primary and secondary elements of consciousness. These are brought to new complex results, and each result has a unique character: " i. e., concepts, judgments, laws, etc. The chief merit of the book may be said to lie in its acute and discerning analysis of the complex phenomena of consciousness, especially of the higher manifestations of feeling and will. But, on the other hand, it fails in clearness in regard to the fundamental principles; instead of the logical develop- ment of the standpoint once adopted, a marked vacillation becomes disagreeably noticeable. Like Ebbinghaus, Jodl also is a follower of the Ac/uali/dtst/ieorie:. mind and consciousness are for him nothing more than the totality of all psychic states, not something unique and independent, which is prior to and forms the basis of particular psychic acts. The supposition of a parallelism between consciousness and cerebral processes also finds an advocate in Jodl, so far as such a parallelism " can be verified by experience. " That is to say, where- ever there is consciousness, nerve and cerebral processes are to be pre-</page><page sequence="3">388 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. VIII. supposed, but it by no means follows that all neurological and cere- bral processes are accompanied by consciousness. Causal connection does not obtain between the two sides: " Consciousness cannot be transformed into nerve movement, nor nerve movement into conscious- ness." That is Jodl's methodological principle. In particular cases, however, he cannot avoid speaking of the transformation of move- ment into consciousness, and so subscribing to the realism of natural science. He assumes objective stimuli in the form of motions, which proceed from unknown things-in-themselves, existing in ' trans-subjec- tive ' space outside of us, and which affect the brain by means of the nerves. Here they become " transformed into consciousness " (p. 42 ), ' internalized ' (and that, through the nervous system, p. 7 I); organic life relates the states of the outer world to itself, and trans- forms them into its own inner states (p. 9I); "what is perceived must awaken consciousness " (p. 95) ; the stimuli, when they are compre- hended, produce effects on consciousness, and necessarily appear in consciousness in relations in which their nature mirrors itself. In spite of his methodological principle, Jodl sometimes makes con- sciousness arise out of movement in especially highly organized mat- ter. What we really find here is a shame-faced ma/eriahism. The same is true, also, when he speaks of " the plasticity of the nerve- substance, which we call memory" (p. 71); where he, with Hering, makes memory a " universal function of organized matter " (p. 88); when he sees in the developed consciousness merely a phenomenon resulting from the summation of simple sensations, or when he regards the whole psychic life only as higher stages of a potentiality, which is the characteristic feature of the entire organic development : the " capacity of retaining impressions from stimuli, and applying them to the assimilation of new ones " (p. II5). All this is conceived in thoroughly materialistic fashion, and implies a development of the psychical out of the physical, of consciousness out of movement. The parallelistic theory strives to apply the fundamental laws of natural science to the spiritual also, and yet to avoid both materialism and mechanism. This goal it can reach only if it does not, as Jodl does, limit itself to the attempt to find material processes as the reverse side of consciousness, but, on the other hand, it must also hold that, ' wherever material processes are present, there must also be inner conditions, psychical elements of some sort.' Psychophysical parallelism must re- sult in Pan-psychism, or atomistic hylozoism (or whatever else it may be called). Only then consciousness is not awakened through movement, but psychical processes give rise to psychical processes</page><page sequence="4">No. 4.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY. 389 inner states are carried over from one unity to another, and call forth in it new psychical processes of a different character. The logical development of this hypothesis then, would, indeed, as it seems to me, lead to the supposition that in the nerve fibers and brain cells there is such a transmission of psychical states from one smallest ele- ment to another, ending finally in a central consciousness. This central consciousness must-according to the parallelistic view- naturally manifest itself externally as material element, and need not stand in relation with every single brain cell, but only with a number of subordinate centers. And, strange to say, this very view emerges even in Jodl, when he says that consciousness is " active within its environment as a center of force " (p. I33). There are still many other fine things said about consciousness, which are thoroughly in- consistent with the actitalittstheorie. It is " receptivity and spon- taneity at once: capable of receiving stimuli, of taking up, forming, connecting and relating matter " (p. 96); without an internalization, i. e., a consciousness which perceives, distinguishes, and compares, there can be no conversion of physical relations into psychical; the stimuli or things act upon consciousness (p. Io7). In all of these passages, consciousness is something substantial, the prius of the single psychic processes, not something whose whole nature is exhausted in them; their ground, not their totality. I believe that here there is involved, not merely an obscurity of terminology, but a confusion of thought, which in turn rests upon the fact that in these questions there are inherent difficulties, which the actuali/fls/eorie is able neither to solve nor to evade. That theory will not be the final word of psychology, and the contradictions, in which Jodl involuntarily and unwittingly involves himself, appear to me to be a proof of this. Just now the actualdtstheorie (for the most part in connection with the doctrine of psychophysical parallelism in one form or another) is enjoying great respect. In W. Wundt also it has a zealous adher- ent: Grunzdriss der Psycho/ogle (Leipzig, W. Engelmann, i896; 2d ed. i897.-PP. 392 ; 3d ed. i898), and Vorlesungen iiber die Afenschen und Thierseile (3d revised ed., Hamburg u. Leipzig, L. Voss, i897.-PP. 529). Both works are familiar to readers of the REVIEW through translations, and through notices in this journal. I can, therefore, be brief. The Gruniriss presents what is most im- portant and essential in psychology in the most systematic form pos- sible in such a treatise. It is intended also to serve as a first intro- duction to the study of psychology. In spite of the excellence of its subject-matter, however, the form of the exposition is not especially well</page><page sequence="5">390 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. VIII. adapted to this purpose. It is too abstract, lacks vividness, and, therefore, is not easily understood by the beginner. In addition, it suffers from the author's tendency to use involved constructions, compli- cated architectonic, and a multiplicity of divisions, the members of which cannot be exhaustively treated within the limits of an outline. The Vorlesungen possess quite a different character; they seek to give, in a more popular form, the nature and purpose of experimental psy- chology, and to discuss from that standpoint the more general phil- osophical problems to which psychology gives rise. The Vorlesungen appeared first in i863, were entirely revised in i892, and in i897 greatly supplemented and improved. The youthful energy and elas- ticity of the exposition, which were characteristic of the first edition, made their influence felt in the revisions, although, naturally, they could not effect a complete revival of the earlier style. With regard to form, the Vorlesungen may always be very favorably compared with Wundt's most recent publications, and they appear to me much better adapted than the Grundriss to introduce students and laymen to the problems of psychology. In sharp contrast to the works hitherto mentioned, stands Al. Hbfler's Psycho/ogie (Wien u. Prag, F. Tempsky, i897.-pp. 604). According to Wundt, there are "still only two sorts of scientific psychology: Experimental and ' Folk' psychology ;" " the possibility of the application of the experimental method extends just as far as the individual consciousness extends " ( Vorlesungen, p. 1 2 ). Parents, indeed, often see in their children, especially if they are talented, more than is really there. And so it is intelligible that the father of ex- perimental psychology should scornfully reject any other brand of the science. Hdfler avoids this one-sidedness. He gives to experiment what belongs to it, but at the same time recognizes the fundamental significance of pure introspection. Without the latter, his own work would have been impossible. His problem, therefore, was, " on the one hand, to work out, with the greatest possible distinctness, the fundamental determinations of a conceptual, terminological, classifica- tory sort, and, on the other, not to remain always in these lowlands of psychological investigation, but also to keep in view the highest philosophical interests " (p. iii). In the accurate description and acute analysis of psychical phenomena, which is everywhere the most prominent feature, and which is uniformly developed according to a definite plan, I find the chief merit of the work. This is the one in- dispensable, although often troublesome, task, without which it is not possible to arrive at clear definitions and classifications, or to reach a</page><page sequence="6">No. 4.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY 39I sounder terminology. In grateful recognition of this service which Hofler has rendered, people will not be inclined to complain much about the length and minuteness of the exposition, or about the more frequent repetition of what is elementary than is demanded by a purely scientific treatment. These qualities of the work are to some extent explained by the fact that a part of the text of the Psycho/ogle is meant also to serve as a text-book for elementary philosophical in- struction in the Austrian gymnasia, and appeared separately under the title: Grund/lehren der Psyc/zo/oge, LeAr/ext und Uebuvzgen fiir tden Uzterric/it an Gyminasienz (I897.-pp. i68). From this part, the whole work receives a certain didactic bias, which appears in the use that is made of typographical devices for rendering the orientation easier, in the frequent insertion of questions and exercises, and also in the whole method of treating the problems. These features render the work more like a schoolbook than a scientific treatise. But it seems to me, however, that this method is not altogether advantageous for the subject-matter. It would have been better to have separated the two purposes, and to have given a different character to the larger work than to the smaller. And, in view of the author's great learning, and his ability to clearly grasp and plainly expound the problems, such a separate treatment would not have been difficult for him.-In dealing with the questions about the nature of the mind and its relation to the body, Hlfler is very cautious. In the case of both problems, it is, according to him, not psychology, but metaphysics that has the last word. And he most carefully avoids making " explanations in the form of deductions from metaphysical or physiological premises. " What he limits himself to, and what alone he intends to analyze and explain, so far as they per- mit of explanation, are facts of psychical experience. None of the theories about the relations between body and mind has, in his opinion, reached a final conclusion, but on the contrary, there re- mains everywhere much that is inexplicable and difficult to compre- hend. H6fler himself is decidedly little inclined to monism, but in other respects he indicates his position (which seems to be a sort of metaphysical dualism) only in a very guarded way. In particular points, his views are strongly influenced byi Brentano, Meinong and Ehrenfels. Slouch further still than H6fler is H. Cornelius removed from the tendencies of experimental psychology (Psyc/zo/ogie a/s Erfa/hrungs- wissezsc/iaft. Leipzig, B. G. Teubner, I897.-pp. 445). He ac- knowledges, to be sure, the right of physiological psychology to exis- tence, but he makes fundamental to the whole science, the 'pure' psychology which is gained through " analysis of the phenomena of our</page><page sequence="7">392 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. VIII. own consciousness, and through the interpretation of communications given to us by others about their states of consciousness. " The object of the book is not to give a " complete enumeration and exposition of the facts of the psychical life and the theories advanced for their expla- nation," but to provide a " foundation for a pure empirical theory of psychical facts with the exclusion of allmetapizysical presuippositious, and consequently, an epistemological basis for psychology (p. iii)." The last expression one can, indeed, convert into its opposite, for Cor- nelius sees in psychology " the only possible foundation of all phil- osophy, especially of the theory of knowledge " (p. 7). In connec- tion with Kirchhoff 's and Mach's methodological services in the physical domain, Cornelius sets up as the goal of his work " the com- plete and most simple systematic description of psychical facts. " He maintains that he agrees with Hume, James, Avenarius, and Kant, in several points. He strongly opposes, on the other hand, all atomistic psychology, especially the pure association psychology. The primary ' given' is complex in the highest degree; the complex phenomena are not synthetically built up from simple elements, but on the contrary the elements themselves are only very late abstractions, which we reach through analysis of the given phenomena (pp. 227228). And it is just by means of these analyses that Cornelius is led to a " series of funda- mental facts, which are not further reducible," which he regards as the " conditions of the temporal sequence and the connection of our psychical life." Moreover, on the basis of these facts, certain laws re- sult which rule the course of our psychical development (p. 426). Cornelius thus makes inferences from effects to causes; and his thought is thereby infected with all the uncertainty and the possibility of error which cannot be separated from that method of investigation. His analyses, as well as his results, will be doubted and contradicted both by those who share his fundamental standpoint, and by experi- mental psychologists. In other respects, his work shows acuteness and energy of thought. It is instructive, much less on account of its so- lution of problems, and the difficulties, which it overcomes, than through the fact that it leads the reader into a labyrinth without leaving a way of escape, and thus indirectly proves the impossibility of treating psy- chology without any metaphysical hypothesis. Such a necessary hypothesis is the supposition of things-in-themselves; for without this, psychology, at least phzysiologicacl psychology and psychophysics, is impossible. Both these sciences are based upon the presupposition that our sensations stand in a relation of dependence on stimuli. These stimuli cannot exist as processes in our own consciousness, for</page><page sequence="8">No. 4.1 GERMAN PHILOSOPHY. 393 there is nothing in it but our sensations and their elaborations; they must, on the contrary, be viewed as changes in an extra-psychical space that has to be postulated. These basal principles Cornelius sets aside, because he is seeking to completely eliminate things-in- themselves ;-and yet he recognizes those sciences as existing, and still speaks of stimuli. There is here only one alternative: Either to acknowledge the realism of natural science (and with it extra-psy- chical space, time, movement, thing-in-itself), or to deny the causal relation between stimulus and sensation. The method and manner in which Cornelius Jrofessedly makes the conception of thing-in-itself psychologically explicable are altogether insufficient; really he trans- forms the conception, and then explains what is the product of his own imagination; but just on this account the complete description of the facts, which he promised, has not been given. A great part of Cornelius's work could more properly be called epistemology than psychology. Consequently, I insert here an ac- count of a small book, but one exceedingly rich in content, whose title at once indicates its relation to both of those disciplines. It is Jh. Ziehen's Psycho/p/ysiologisc/ze Erkernuziiss//ieorie (Jena, G. Fischer, I898.-pp. I05). As an associationist, Ziehen would be opposed by Cornelius. In other respects, however, the two possess much in com- -mon. Above all, it is also Ziehen's aim to construct the world of ex- perience with the elimination of the baneful thing-in-itself. In spite of the great acuteness that he expends, he does not succeed in his at- tempt, and could not from the nature of the thing (and also of the ' in-itself'). ' Non-psychical ' is, according to Ziehen, an empty and meaningless word. Things, my self, and other selves, are only ideas. This is not solipsism. Much more is it true that my own ego is not primary, but, just as another's ego, only a Redkiklionsvorstelunog; i. e., one of the complex ideas which we put in place of the primary given elements, namely, sensations and memory images, in order that we may get an ordered, i. e., universally valid system of sensations (p. 38). Other such Redu/ktionsvorste/iuigogen, of which the popular consciousness, as well as natural science, religion, and metaphysics, stand in need, are, for example, external object, matter, atom, mass, ether, God. Our ego is always individual; not so, sensations. If no nervous systems existed, there would still consciously exist an extra- -individual core of sensations (their Reduk/ionsbestandstei)-not, in- deed, in an individual consciousness, but psychic in general, as " uni- versal conscious sensation." The latter idlea is, according to Ziehen, neither full of contradiction, nor without content. Those psychic</page><page sequence="9">394 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. VIII. Reduk/ionsbes/acneiie should certainly not be taken for sensations, but for ideas, since they arise through abstraction and association; on the other hand, however, they consist of "spatially and tem- porally ordered qualities of definite intensity," which can be again " reduced to spatial and temporal relations and motions ;" in addition to which, in the meantime, a third factor enters, namely, energy (p. 59). Ziehen rightly protests against confusing his Reduktions- bestandleile with the matter of the natural science, and I also agree with him in holding that this matter is a mere abstraction, to which one cannot ascribe any non-psychical existence. But is Ziehen thereby rid of things-in-themselves ? It seems to me that in his Reduktions- bes/andleile we have things-in-themselves over again, only with a new label. They are something added by thought to the ' given,' and hence are emphatically ideas. The same holds good for things-in- themselves. But do both on that account have to be only ideas? Since I, in order to bring meaning and order into the world of ex- perience, must add them in thought to experience as its 'cause,' ' presupposition,' or ' final reality,' could they not be more than mere ideas, and yet exist outside of my consciousness? The latter possi- bility Ziehen admits; but, nevertheless, izeas-his Reduktionsbes/and- teile-are to remain. These, however, stand in causal connection with one another; those of bodies outside of me act as stimuli upon the Reduktionsbeslandteile of my brain, and have here as effect the appear- ance of real sensations. Thus what is secondary must produce some- thing primary (the sensation) ! I am of the opinion that this state of affairs forces Ziehen to the admission that he must presuppose that his Reduktionsbestandteile, which, indeed, are in the first place a product of abstraction and association, are still more, in fact are something which exists independently of ideating or ideation. But then we should once more be back again at things-in-themselves. In a concluding section, Ziehen, with a certain satisfaction, proves that metaphysics and religion are now replaced and rendered superfluous by natural science, psychology, and epistemology. And Ziehen's " universal conscious sensations " ? To me they seem to lead us into the midst of the purest metaphysics. For me they are an inadmissable concept, although I believe that things-in-themselves are of a psychical nature. Believe-but do not certai;ly kizow. For it is indeed true thatfor us " psychic and existing are entirely congruent conceptions " (p. 5). But the limits of my consciousness and thought are not necessarily the limits of existence in general. From a scientific point of view, the only judgment possible is a non liquet. And by going beyond this conclusion Ziehen becomes a metaphysician.</page><page sequence="10">No. 4.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY. 395 Returning to psychology proper, I may mention that there has ap- peared a fourth and partially revised edition of Ziehen's Leiffaden der physiologische Psychologie (Jena, G. Fischer, i898). The book, how- ever, is not at present before me. One feels as if he had been transferred to another world when he passes from the works hitherto noticed to Fr. Harms's Psychologie, which H. Wiese has published from the manuscript remains of his teacher (Leipzig, Th. Grieben, I897.-pp. 204). This is the last installment of the remains. Since i885 have appeared a Metaphysic, Logic, Ethics, Philosophy of Rights, and a Philosophy of Nature. The publication of these works seems to signify that Harms still has many admirers, and also that his posthumous works find purchasers. In par- ticular, Weise has for years been over and over again besought to publish the Psychologie. And yet the work, regarded as psychology, is quite out of date, and was so even at the time of the author's death (188o). Harms is a disciple of the older speculative philosophy. Psychology, according to him, becomes a philosophical science only if it can be proved "that the soul or the principle of consciousness is universal and necessary, or that it is impossible to think of a universe without a principle of consciousness " (p. i6). Theories about the nature of the soul " are much less dependent upon observation of facts of con- sciousness than upon fundamental principles, the system of which is philosophy" (p. I 7); and accordingly the psychology of any age represents, as in a copy, the system of contemporary philosophy. This is a frank and honest statement. Harms recognizes what the ' scienti- fic' psychologists of to-day often miss, namely, that the determina- tion of the ultimate principle of consciousness, of the nature of the ' soul,' lies beyond the limits of science, and within the domain of metaphysics. About the nature and concept of the soul as a substantial, spiritual principle, about its faculties and activities, Harms philos- ophizes in this volume in a clear and attractive manner. We have thus before us, not psychology, but metaphysics. And as metap/zysics, the work possesses not only historical, but also actual significance. For the subjective factors, which in metaphysics are of decisive moment, do not grow old and pass away like the theories of science, but are grounded in our common human nature and will change only with man- kind itself. In contrast, an actual purey SCZc value belongs still to-day to the Emipzrischen Psyc/wioogie nachy naiurweissensch/afccher Affelhode of M. W. Drobisch. The publisher, L. Voss, has prepared a new edi- tion, unchanged except for the correction of printers' errors (Ham-</page><page sequence="11">396 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. VIII. burg u. Leipzig, I898.-PP. 355). The work first appeared in I842, and after that was for many years out of print, and could be obtained only at a high price. The still large crowd of Herbartians will be particularly thankful for the new edition. But not only they; for, however much of an Herbartian in psychology Drobisch is in the present work, still this does not make itself nearly so much felt as in the Ers/en Grundlehren der math/ema/isclen Psycholooge (i850). His empirical psychology professes to start from the facts of inner expe- rience, and to gain a knowledge of their laws, without the help of metaphysics and philosophy in general, or without the assistance of mathematics, employing only unbiased observation, classification, comparison, and synthesis of the facts. Consequently, more than two- thirds of the work is devoted to the task of giving an empirical sur- vey of the entire conscious life, and with this survey in mind the last hundred pages lead us " to an explanatory point of view, by means of which the truth of the Herbartian theory of the soul, which was originally derived by speculation, is preserved." Naturally, in spite of this apparent empiricism, the Herbartian standpoint is evident at several points even in the first two-thirds of the work. Nevertheless, everyone who does not expect everything that is good to come from experimental psychology alone, but also believes in introspection, or, as Drobisch says, " in the autopsy, methodologically performed ac- cording to approved scientific rules," will often and gladly go back to this work, in which there is a profusion of material, clearly, acutely, and concretely elaborated and expounded. In a very brief manner, I shall refer, in concluding this section, to a special field of literature, which aims at making psychological investi- gations serviceable to pedagogy. In I897, there appeared a second and very much enlarged edition of the Psychologie als Grundwisseiz- scizaft der Pddagogik: Ein Lehr und Handbuch unter Mitwirkung von K. Heilmann herausgegeben von M. Jahn (Leipzig, Diirr.-pp. 4I3). The work is very carefully written, is clear, though discursive in ex- position, and belongs in any case to the best books of its kind which Germany has up to this time produced. Nearly all of these works suffer from the fact that pedagogists, and not professional psycholo- gists, are their authors. It may be that in this way the selection of what is valuable for teachers to know (especially in the lower schools), as well as what is capable of pedagogical application, is rendered easier; but still, as they are only works at second-hand, they cannot issue from a wealth of productive activity, such as is possessed by those who stand in the midst of the development of the science, and</page><page sequence="12">No. 4.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY. 397 themselves further that development. Therefore, I am delighted that the work of a man, who is at once both a psychologist of recognized rank and at the same time a pedagogist, has been made accessible through a translation to the German world of teachers. It is J. Sully's Eandbuch der Psychologie fur -Leirer. Eine Gesamrdars/ellung der paydagogischen Psychologiefir -Lelrer und S/udzfrende. Uebersetzt von J. Stimpfl (Leipzig, E. Wunderlich, i898.-pp. 447). The translation,, which, to be sure, is not always happy, should be carefully revised in the second edition, for which we hope there will soon be a demand. IV. IESTHETICS. The passage from psychology to Esthetics may be mediated by a work whose title at once shows that it treats of problems connected with both sciences: Jh. Lipps's Raurmaestheiik und geormetrisch- op//sche ]7iuschungen. Mit i83 Figuren und einer Tafel (Schrf/Ier der GeselIschaft fairpsycholgische Eorschung, II Sammlung, Hefte 9 u. io, Leipzig, J. Ambr. Barth, I897.-pp. 424). This book deserves a very thorough notice, and needs it, if one is even approximately to do justice to its extraordinarily rich content. No notice, however, can give an adequate idea of its worth, and its unique character; to obtain that one must read the book for oneself, and no one will have cause to repent the labor thus involved. We have here before us the provisional conclusion of studies the first fruit of which was an essay in the Festschri/t in honor of Helmholtz's seventieth birthday: " Aesthetische Factoren der Raumanschauung " (i891). Lipps be- lieves that he can establish a common basis for the aesthetic percep- tion of geometrical forms and for geometrical-optical illusions; namely, the ideas of mechanical activities, which we introject into the given forms. We see the latter, not only as they are; but through inner compulsion we represent to ourselves how they become, not once for all, but in each moment anew. We make them an object of mechanical interpretation; not through reflection, but immediately. With the perception of a Doric column, for example, is also given, as a consequence of numberless experiences, the idea of the manner in which such a form or spatial mode of existence is possible, or is able to maintain itself. But, further, we compare the mechanical event with what happens within us. The mechanical event, which appears to complete itself easily and without check, arouses in us the pleasurable feeling of the ease and freedom of our own activity; the great ex- penditure of active mechanical energy reminds us of the similar ex- penditure of our own energy of will, and arouses in us the no less</page><page sequence="13">398 THL PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. VIII. pleasurable feeling of our own power. With this mechanical interpre- tation, consequently, there is united in the closest way, and without any reflection, the aesthetic, anthropomorphizing interpretation. The mechanical activity of a Doric column, for example, shows itself " in the erectness and compactness of its structure," and "I sympathize with the way the Doric column has of holding itself or manifesting an inner activity, because I recognize therein a natural and pleasurable mode of behavior of my own. " Thus, all pleasure aroused by spatial forms-and, we can add, all aesthetic pleasure in general-is a pleasur- able feeling of sympathy." In virtue of this mechanical interpretation, it now further appears to our fancy as if the pillar intended, or as if it directed its efforts, to make itself still more compact, and to grow in a vertical direction. The result is a geometrical-optical illusion; we overestimate the height, and underestimate the breadth. And this is unavoidable. For it is an interpretative process of adding in thought mechanical activities and opposing tendencies, and is something which no one can escape. Stated generally, this means that all geometrical-optical illusions arise out of the idea of forces, activities, tendencies, which seem to act in spatial forms and to have made them. In representing to ourselves those forces, we allow them to fulfil themselves, and thereby to increase in the representation their perceived effect. Thus the limited (the breadth of a column) is as such underestimated; since in it a limitative tendency seems to be at work, we quite invol- untarily allow it to grow narrower in our representation of it. Vertical distances, as opposed to horizontal, are overestimated; to the former, we attach the idea of an activity producing the distance, and thereby also the idea of a vertical self-extension. Hence the actually perceived extension at the same time appears greater to us. All illusions of this sort are, accordingly, not modifications of the actual perceptions, but illusions of judgment, more exactly, fallacious judgments of com- parison. But these judgments do not rest upon conscious reflection any more than the aesthetic mechanical interpretation is due to insight and reflection; that is, to knowledge and the conscious application of laws. What is here everywhere active is rather an unconscious precipitate of previous experiences, which has given rise in us to a law. The latter is active in us, without our being conscious of it, often indeed, with- out our being in a condition to formulate it; we gain our feeling for form gradually, just as we gain a feeling for language. These fundamental principles are now applied to the smallest details in the wide field of optical illusions, and are elucidated by a wealth of</page><page sequence="14">No. 4.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY. 399 examples and figures. Throughout, at the same time, the relation to esthetics is established, and the effort is made to prove that every aesthetic perception of geometric forms has for its basis sympathetic self-introjection. The acute, logical development of the main thesis is masterly, and must arouse unqualified admiration in anyone who has an appreciation for energy of thought and force of concep- tion, whether he agrees with the principles or not. We have few philosophical works in the literature of to-day which are so thoroughly unitary in plan and conception. But, to be sure, the matter has also its reverse side. In his attempt to reduce everything to a few funda- mental laws, Lipps overestimates not a little, as it seems to me, the sphere of their application. There is for him only one alternative: Either everything or nothing. He admits that separate groups of geometrical-optical illusions can be comprehended in a plausible way under another point of view. But he thinks that nothing is gained by this; for one can speak of a satisfactory explanation only when it can extend over all the facts in question. Of the rules which have hitherto been advanced for the explanation of single groups of illusions, there are none " which, when taken generally, i. e., in earnest, can - not be overthrown by facts easily established. " In opposition to this, it must be said that we cannot determine a jriori, whether one principle of explanation suffices for the totality of optical illusions, or whether different principles must be employed for different groups. The one supposition is as possible as the other; which is real, experience alone can tell, and science has simply to recognize the facts. Science, there- fore, ought not to despise a principle simply because it can explain only single groups. To me it seems very probable that even Lipps's theory is not all-sufficient, either in the sphere of optical illusions, or, above all, in that of esthetic questions. For me, in any case, there is a large number of spatial forms, which afford aesthetic enjoyment, and yet have nothing to do with "'anthropomorphic interpretation" and "pleasurable sympathetic feeling. " It must not remain unmentioned that W. Wundt also published in i898 an essay on" Diegeometrish-optischen Tiuschungen" (Abhand- lungen der ma/thema/isch-physic/en Classe der KOniwl Sachs. Gesell- schaff der Wissenschaften, XXIV, 2, pp. 53-I78). According to Wundt, optical illusions belong to the content of perception itself, and must be explained from the conditions of perception (especially occular movements, as well as their basis: pressure and strain sensa- tions in the eye). Still another work appeared from Lipps's pen in i898: Komik</page><page sequence="15">400 THEE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. VIII. u. Humor. Elne psyc/ologo-isch-aes//zetic/ze Untersuchung (Beitrdge zur Aesthetik. Herausgegeben v. Jh. Lipps u. R. M. Werner. VI. Hamburg u. Leipzig, L. Voss.-pp. 264). This book is a re- vision and great enlargement of articles which appeared in philo- sophical journals in i888-i889. Here also Lipps shows that he pos- sesses the power of acute psychological analysis, besides being a man of fine aesthetic sensibility. We have here before us undoubtedly the best book that has been written in recent years on the comic and the humorous. But the last word, that removes all doubt, has not yet been spoken in this field either. It seems to me that Lipps makes the same mistake as in the Raurnisthelik: he generalizes too much and too soon. A principle that is valid within a limited sphere is used to explain everything. The essential basis of the comic in general is declared to be an opposition between what possesses mean- ing, the sublime, and what is without meaning, what is small and of no account. A sublime thing or a lofty mode of behavior shrinks for us into nothing; such is the comic. This feeling arises in us through the fact that the high psychical energy, which was attributed to something full of meaning, suddenly turns out to be of no account. The perception of the latter can easily and unrestrainedly expand itself in the mind. This process is accompanied by a specific feeling of pleasure, namely, that of the comic, since everywhere " the excess of the supply of psychic force over the demand is the ground of pleasure." " The feeling of the comic is thus a feeling of the man- ner in which my act succeeds." In itself the comic has no aesthetic worth. But the case is otherwise with humor. Humor has the task of making the sublime appear attractive, and of discovering it where it is concealed in all sorts of petty and trivial things. It is " sub- limity in and through the comic." The comic "exists, then, for the purpose of being raised to the level of humor. And therein con- sists its moral and aesthetic significance." In endeavoring to carry out his theory of the comic in detail, Lipps does not succeed without straining and doing violence to the facts. Many facts cannot at all, as it seems to me, be explained by Lipps's principle; for example, many witticisms, drolleries, especially as manifested by children and animals, the element of the comic involved in ' contagious' laughter and other mimicry. If we look over the many theories of the comic, each of which, according to the author's view, explains everything; according to the opponent's opinion, nothing, or, at most, only a single case, and if, on the other hand, we go over the enormous amount of what might affect us as comic, in all its manifoldness and</page><page sequence="16">No. 4.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY. 40I variety, the conclusion forces itself upon us that the sphere of the comic must probably be destitute of unity. At first, in any case, it will be found best to limit the inquiry to an investigation of the nature and laws of particular kinds of the comic. The results will thereby, to be sure, lose in universality and extent, but will agree the more closely with experience, and will be obtained from experience itself naturally and without doing violence to the facts. Only when this has been done, is it permissable to seek for still higher generalizations. Then, perhaps, some results might be attained. The specific nature of the different instances would at all events receive its due, and what is really a specific characteristic would no longer, as heretofore, be regarded as generic. It is possible too, however, that we may arrive at the conclusion that only the feeling of the comic has a unitary specific character, but that among the objects which arouse this feeling there prevails a manifoldness of nature, which can no more be brought under a general formula than the different ways and modes in which feeling is aroused and comes into existence. The sphere of the comic in any case has not the same unity as the tragic. The latter is discussed in a work which is generally recog- nized as very important. Although it is not before me, its title, at least, may be mentioned here: Joh. Volkelt's Aesthe/ik des Tragischen (Munich, C. H. Beck, i897). In conclusion, brief reference must be made to three works of de- ceased authors-dead and yet living-two of whom at least can- not by any means yet be said to have exerted their proper in- fluence.-Fechner and Fr. Th. Vischer. Of G. The. Fechner's Vorsclule der Aest/elilk (first ed., i876), a second (unaltered) edition has become necessary (Leipzig, Breitkopf u. Hdrtel, I897, i898.-Vols. I, II, pp. 264 + 3i9). This is a very pleasing fact, because, for one reason, it shows that interest in Fechner is on the increase, and also because the book in itself is valuable for esthetics. Fechner does not attempt at the beginning to establish conceptually the objective nature of the beautiful, and then to descend from the most general ideas and conceptions to the particular case. That would be an 'ocsthetik von oben.' He is content to give an ' sesthetik von unten,' and to discover the empirical conditions and laws of Esthetic pleasure (wherever possible, with the help of experiment and measure- ment). This empirical method seems to me, too, to be the only one that can lead to lasting results. The best proof of its fruitfulness is Fechner's Vorschzule, with its many permanent and valuable results. Fr. Theod. Vischer in his large work on ,esthetics does not, indeed,</page><page sequence="17">402 TIE PHIL OSOPHIICAL RE VIE W. [VOL. VIII. start from experience, but goes deep into experience. The book is itself a work of art, comparable to an elaborate and magnificent edifice; but just on that account it is not of interest for the majority of educated people. And still it is not right that this distinguished man should popularly be known only as the author of ' just another' book on aesthetics. Hence it is a very welcome fact that his son, Robert Vischer, a student of Aesthetics like his father, proposes to publish the latter's lectures. 'Fir das deutsche Volk herausgegeben ' is subjoined to the complete title-and rightly! So far one volume has been pub- lished, which appeared in i897, and was reprinted in i898. Das Sch/ne und die Kunst. Zur Einf ihzrung in die Aes/hetik. Vortage von Fr. Th. Vischer. Mit seinem Bildniss. (Stuttgart, J. G. Cotta.-pp. 309). It has been no easy labor to prepare the lectures for the printer. The elder Vischer made only outlines for his lectures (really only jottings), and then delivered them extemporaneously. These outlines were continually altered, supplemented, and replaced by new ones. They furnish the basis for the present work. In ad- dition, more or less accurate notes taken by his pupils have been utilized. This unequal and mosaic material, the son has, with as great art as labor, united into a uniform work which possesses all the impressiveness and immediacy of a captivating and extem- poraneous lecture. Throughout the book, there pulsates a fresh warm life, from it there speaks a remarkable, many-sided per- sonality, and in it is manifested a fine appreciation for the beautiful in all its forms; several expressions, which literary language usually avoids, give to it a touch of whole-heartedness and directness. The work embraces only the first two general parts of aesthetics, which Vischer in his teaching was accustomed to present before taking up the particular arts. It treats, that is, of the universal conceptions of aesthet- iCS (p. 223), and of art in general. The later lectures are not to be published, since their content does not essentially differ from the older work. The general parts, however, not only formally possess an entirely different character, but they also show Vischer's views from a more advanced standpoint. Much that is important in the correspond- ing parts of the older work is omitted or differently applied. Specu- lation recedes into the background; from a metaphysic he has almost passed to a psychology of the beautiful. Its character is so thoroughly popular that Robert Vischer rightly regards the book as well adapted to the purpose of introducing beginners into the study of aesthetics. In i888 there was published one volume of the literary remains of K. Har. von Stein, who died so prematurely. Now there has appeared</page><page sequence="18">No. 4.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY. 403 also his Vorlesungen iiber Aesthelik, which he delivered at the Univer- sity of Berlin in the summer semesters of i885-87. (Nach vorhande- nen Aufzeichnungen bearbeitet. Mit H. von Stein's Bildniss. Stutt- gart, J. G. Cotta, 1897.-PP. 145.) The available material was very scanty, consisting of jottings, catch-words from the remains of Stein, and trains of thought rarely complete, and one very incomplete copy of a student's notes. For the most part, therefore, merely single words or parts of sentences had to serve as the basis of the text. In spite of this, all the characteristic phrases and expressions are derived from the existing records. It is a question, under circumstances, which leave entirely too much to the subjectivity of the editor, whether it would not have been better to have refrained from publica- tion. Science at least would hardly have lost anything. Of course, the lectures contain much that is interesting and good. But, as a whole, they are lacking in finish and completeness. Naturally, science measures according to one standard, friendship according to another. To those who honored and studied under the deceased, the book, even in its present form, will be valued in itself and prized as a memorial. V. ETHICS. In the years which fall within the scope of our notice, there is a series of ethical writings, which are very instructive on account of the diversity, both of the methods employed, and the ends in view. The only correct method, in my opinion, is the one adopted by Chr. v. Ehrenfels in his System der Wer/theorie (Bd. I, Ailgemeine Wert- theorle, Psychologle des Begehrens. Bd. II. Grundzzige elner Ethik. Leipzig, 0. R. Reisland, I897, I898.-pp. 277+270). Both volumes are an elaboration and revision of articles, which the author published under the titles "Werttheorie u. Ethik" and "Ueber Fiihlen u. Wollen," in the Vierte{4ahrsschrift fiir wissenschaftl. Philos. (1893, i894), and in the Sitzungsberichben d. _phil. hist. XKasse, of the Vienna Academy (i887). Justly enough, Ehrenfels upbraids philosophers for having almost entirely abandoned the discussion of phenomena of value to political economy, although here important problems for psy- chology and ethics await treatment. The present system is designed to supply this omission. The third volume, which has not yet appeared, will deal with the facts and problems of value in their ethical-economic aspect, and will subject the purely economical theory of value to a critical investigation from the logical and psychological standpoints. The first volume, dealing with a general theory of value, treats of what is common to all human values and evaluations: namely, defini- tions, variations of derivations from the universal conceptions of value,</page><page sequence="19">404 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. VIII. classification and measurement of value, errors in evaluation, objects of value, and, further, the laws which govern changes in value. At the same time, the author here indicates his position in regard to cer- tain fundamental problems of psychology, such as the relation between feeling and desire, and the nature of desire. For that which is of value is identical with what is ' desirable': " the worth of a thing is its desirability " (I, p. 53). The whole science of value rests thus upon the psychology of feeling and desire. Still, Ehrenfels believes that he may claim a validity for the essential part of his theory, in- dependent of the psychological standpoint which the special investi- gator adopts-provided, of course, that the theory does justice at least to the most general facts of experience. Thus, ethics is naturally for Ehrenfels a branch of the general theory of value: prizing what is good, and despising what is bad, are phenomena of evaluation. A psychological investigation of facts of moral value is the first essential. Only on the basis of this investigation, is it possible to reach a decision in regard to the question, whether ethics is possible as an absolute nor- mative discipline, or whether-to take the opposite extreme-there is no common element in all that has been at different times and places regarded by mankind as good and bad. In particular points, one will often be unable to agree with Ehren- fels. Especially, it may be said that differences in general pyscholog- ical points of view may involve wider results than Ehrenfels is in- clined to assume. But his point of departure and his statement of the problem are correct. The psychology of individuals and of races is the ground from which ethics must spring; and the science of value is the genus, which includes ethics as a species. Such an ethic, to be sure, can tell nothing of absolute values, uncon- ditionally obligatory norms, and categorical imperatives. It can answer only the psychological question, how mankind can and must arrive at these conceptions. For this reason, it is exposed at the outset to the condemnation not only of theologians, but also of many philosophers, above all, of those who attach themselves to Kant. For these op- ponents, ethics as a science stands or falls with the conception of something that is unconditionally worthy and obligatory. Among such writers is to be classed Fel. Krueger in his work: DerBegrziJdes absokit Wertvollen a/s Grundbegriyf der Mora4Mizosophie (Leipzig, B. G. Teubner, i898.-pp. 96). Krueger admits, indeed, that a scien- tific system of ethics can be framed pnly through the application of' the psychological method to the problem of morals, and that, there- fore, it must start from an analysis of the conception of value. Still,</page><page sequence="20">No. 4.] GERMAN PHILOSOPHY 405 he restricts the sphere of ' values ' to constant desires, and believes that he is thus able to deduce something of absolute worth, which possesses value for every individual who passes judgments of value, and which maintains its worth under all conditions. It is the psychical capacity or function of value in general. The moral worth of a man is directly dependent upon his ' evaluating energy,' Wer- /uigsenergie; i. e., upon the measure, in which the function of value (organization or synthesis of a manifold of possible objects of desire) is realized in his psychic life. A very similar mode of thought is to be found in Fr. Staudinger's Das Si/tengesetz. Un/ersuchzzngen iiber die allgemeinen Grundlagen der Erel/zeit und der Si//Zichkeit (Berlin, Frd. DUmnrler, 2d ed., I897. -pp. 387. Neue Titelausgabe der I887 erschienenen Geste/ze der Ereiheit). Staudinger sets out with the object of rescuing Kant's cate- gorical imperative, and of deducing it with mathematical certainty. He maintains that we can speak of morality only when we will something because we ought, and not when we act on account of compulsion or fear, natural disposition or momentary inclination. That is the case only when an end is willed, and reason gives direction regarding the necessary means for attaining the end. Now, there is one supreme end whiich must be universally recognized as the highest moral goal: namely, the complete harmony of all other ends which is necessarily demanded by reason. Without such a synthesis, particular ends would mutually interfere with and destroy one another. Reason, therefore, demands that the individual consciously order his life in accordance with the end; that is the categorical imperative. But a universal law of obligation, a general recognition of something that is of absolute worth, does not exist, and can be established neither by force nor by reason. There are many persons who by no means regard it as a duty, or even as a matter of worldy wisdom, to bring their aims into an or- ganic system, and who just as little ascribe peculiar worth to an in- tensification of their evaluating energy ( Wer/?/ngsenergie). With them, there is no such absolute as Krueger and Staudinger dream of. How then is it to be forced upon them ? On the contrary, the true moral obligation is entirely individual and voluntary; it does not create the good will, it presupposes it. Voluntarily, the moral man puts himself in the position of a faithful vassal in the service of the good; he does not will because he ought, but he ought because he wills. But even if that existed which those who adopt the opposite view so assiduously seek, it would by no means follow that the indi- vidual who recognizes an absolute duty, and has an absolute standard</page><page sequence="21">406 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. VIII. of worth, would necessarily be moral. Suppose some one invariably ascribed the highest value to the pleasures of sense. Or another takes as his chief end, under which he organically subordinates all other aims, the greatest possible injury to his fellows, the spreading of un- happiness, pain, and woe. Krueger and Staudinger would have to call such people good and moral. In reality, the bare formal prin- ciple, that there is an evaluation and a systematization, is not in itself sufficient. Very definite material conditions must be fulfilled. In order to ascertain these, there is nothing left for those who take the opposite view, but finally to take refuge sadly in eudxemonism and utilitarianism, however repellent the system is, and however strongly they may fight against it. It is hopeless, within the domain of ethics, to be hunting for neces- sity and universal validity. This is involuntarily shown to us by 0. Stock's Lebenszweck und Lebensauffassung (Greifswald, J. Abel, i897.-PP. 177). If there is in ethical distinctions no law of logical necessity, then these distinctions are, according to him, purely subjective and arbitrary, and ethics is no longer a true science, but becomes a part of psychology, and sinks to the level of biology. Stock endeavors to establish with logical necessity an end, which is represented neces- sarily as good and pleasure-producing. He finds it in knowledge. Morality consists in the knowledge of the logical connection of ends; the bad will is only deficient knowledge. Knowledge is the power of self-conquest, and thereby is at once a force which binds men together and makes a community possible. As for the necessity of thought which Stock claims for his investigations, it is an individ- ual matter. For one person, one thing is a necessity of thought; for another, another. Schuppe regards ' consciousness in general ' as that which is of absolute worth; Stock, only the individual consciousness which develops in time (i. e., knowledge); Staudinger, the organic arrangement of ends; Krueger, value in general. One proves the possibility of thinking that which the other takes as a necessity of thought, and the impartial spectator sees once more the truth, newly confirmed, that the world's history moves upwards in spiral fashion. He recognizes in the present battle about necessity and universal validity, in ethical and metaphysical questions, something very similar to the attempts of the old rationalism, to get being out of thought. Petitiones jlrincq&gt;ip fallacies, unwarranted assumptions and generaliza- tions, these are even now the apparatus of deductions. Strictness of demonstration is entirely lacking. W. Stern also believes himself called to bestow upon ethics, that</page><page sequence="22">No. 4.3 GERMAN P1/ILOSOPHY. 407 which ever eludes it, namely, a truly scientific character (Kri/ische Grund/egung der El/ilk als posiliver Wissenschaft. Berlin, Ferd. Diimmler, I897.-p. 471). Ethics must be rendered independent of all religious and metaphysical presuppositions, and thereby raised to a positive science. A very laudable undertaking-pity it is, though, that Stern, in order to forego metaphysical dreamnings, loses himself in fancies about the bodily and mental condition of primitive man. Fol- lowing the genetic method, he views morality as something which has been gradually evolved and inherited by generations of men and animals. (A chief point with Stern is that his fundamental ethical principle can also explain the moral phenomena alleged to exist in animals.) Since primitive times, we find detrimental encroachments of inanimate nature upon psychic life, and thereupon reactions ensue on the part of animate creation. Thus, there is developed in mankind and ani- mals a feeling of belonging-together, a feeling of deep resentment against those encroachments, and an ' objective' impulse to ward them off. Out of the latter there gradually grows the moral impulse for the preservation of psychic life in general, through self-sacrificing protection against all detrimental encroachments upon it (even against those pro- ceeding from animate beings). However great respect one must feel for Stern's work as a well thought-out and independent product, it must, nevertheless, be said that he has failed in his main purpose of finding a new basis for ethics. What Stern offers as such, and the manner in which he develops and carries out his basal principle, either stands in direct contradiction to the actual facts of the moral life, or at any rate is in no wise established and proved by them. At this point, mention must be made of a book, which, to be sure, has no special scientific significance, but deserves notice for other reasons. It is Jh. Unold's Grundlegvgi fiir ele nioderne pr1zaklsch- e/zhscize _Lebenanschauung (natlonale it. ideale Sittenle/ire). (Leipzig, S. Hirzel, I896.-pp. 393.) Unold never alludes to the various ' Societies for Ethical Culture,' yet he stands in very close relation to their work. The vital point for him is the independence of morality from religion and church. This is an obvious demand which has long been made on behalf of scientific ethics. But Unold goes further: the training of the populace to a rational and moral course of life should be based upon a scientific theory of morals, conscious of its end. Unold expects wonders from the introduction of such a theory into the schools: the training of the future generations in character and mode of life will be improved, in every class of people there will be awakened a patriotic national consciousness and an enlightened</page><page sequence="23">408 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. VIII. national sentiment. Social acts and social dispositions will increase and intensify, mankind will move with quickened pace toward the goal of the culture-development, to an all-embracing kingdom of peace, freedom, justice, the highest wisdom, virtue, and holiness. Unold is the prototype of the dreamer and idealist. It is, of course, necessary that actuality should be enriched and reformed through ideals. But ideality and life must have something in common; a gradual transition from the one to the other must be possible. The idea that mankind will be converted through mere illumination and intellectual training is so foreign to reality, that no reality will con- form to it. In ethics, also, I may speak of one who has died, but who has come to life again. A new addition of F. H. Th. Allihn's Grundle/ren der a/lgenzeinen El/ik (i86i) appeared under the title: Gruzndriss der El/ik. Neu bearbeitet und erweitert von 0. Flilgel (Langensalza, H. Beyer u. Sbhne, I898.-Pp. 272). Allihn attaches himself in the closest way to Herbart's practical philosophy. In Fligel's eyes, that is his greatest merit. For Herbart's ethics raises us " to the height from which every moral error and one-sidedness can be understood, adjudged, recognized as partial, and corrected " (p. xi). The work is somewhat altered, many things are left out, and many are taken from articles in the Zeilschrift ftir exakie P/ilosopyie. Thus the first II 4 pages consist to a great extent of Allihn's essay on "Die Reform der Ethik durch Herbart "; pp. 206-253 of an article, "Von der Frei- heit des Willens "; neither one is described as an addition, and, in the case of the second essay, there is nothing to tell us that Flilgel is the author). If a system of ethics of the Herbartian school was to be re- published, why it had to be Allihn's, and whether it was wise to recon- struct it in this manner, are questions which Herbartians will have to settle among themselves. In conclusion, only a few words about two works, which will fur- nish a bridge to sociology and practical life. I mean Ldw. Stein's Die sociale Eraqe ini Lichle der Philosop/hie. Vorlesuzgen liber Social- phizlosop/hie und i/re Geschichle (Stuttgart, Ferd. Enke, i897.-PP. 792), and Rich. von Schubert-Soldern's Ecas mensch/iche G/iick u. die sociale Erage. TUbingen, H. Laupp, i896.-PP. 351). Stein com- plains that philosophy has hitherto almost entirely passed over in silence " the most pressing of all questions," namely, the social. He professes to supply in his work something completely new. But it seems to me that, if philosophy is to throw light " on the dismal dark- ness which hovers like a shadow over social problems, " it can be done</page><page sequence="24">No. 4.1 GERMAN PHILOSOPHY. 409 only by means of the most accurate determination of concepts. In- stead of this, we find throughout Stein's book a decided vagueness and ambiguity of terminology. Socialism, social problem, sociology, social philosophy, are all terms about which different people think differently. In spite of this, the introductory 55 pages offer us vague generalities, instead of precise analysis. On page 29, we are told that the social problem has to do with the " forms and conditions of human social- life and social-activity." But this is, according to page 35, "not only one, but /e problem of all socialphilosophy," and, on pages X3- i4, it is also the problem of sociology. And further, in what way is help to be expected from philosophy? Following Comte and Wundt, Stein assigns to philosophy the task of bringing together the final generalizations of all the sciences, and of systematically relating them to one another. In accordance with this standpoint, one would ex- pect to find in Stein's work discussions of the most general epistemo- logical and ultimate metaphysical questions. On the contrary, how- ever, only a few such are present, and these do not penetrate very deeply into the subject, and, in comparison with the large amount of other matter, they play no part at all. According to Stein, then, so- ciology, in keeping with its origin and methods, ought to be a philo- sophical science. The origin, however, is able to determine absolutely nothing; the only thing that can decide is the present condition of the facts. Sociology is becoming more and more of an independent science, and its representatives will have themselves to blame if so- ciology is subordinated to philosophy. With just as much right as sociology, the science of rights, the whole of political economy, ethnography, Cul/urgeschichke, and, indeed, history in general, could be classed with philosophy. Of course, psychology, a general theory of value, and ethics-in other words, pziloso -zcal sciences-have to lay the foundation also for sociology, in so far as they deal with gen- eral principles and problems, which furnish the point of departure for sociology. If Stein intended to make his philosophy useful from this side, he should have thoroughly analyzed and determined the sphere of the conceptions of psychology, theory of value, and ethics, which enter into sociology, and are of such far-reaching significance for " social questions." But such discussions find no place in the mass of material, which is dealt with in the four hundred pages that remain after the introduction and historical part are sub- tracted. Consequently, the light, which philosophy has shed upon the subject, I at any rate cannot discover in the book. Stein's treat- nient of his problem is not philosophical, but sociological, and there-</page><page sequence="25">4IO THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. fore his performance is no literary innovation, but is closely connected with other sociological works. I must, therefore, leave it to sociolo- gists to judge of its merit. But, however great that merit may be, and however much interest its achievements may arouse, it is certainly not a philosophical work that we have before us. A different verdict must be passed upon the second book just men- tioned, a reprint from the Zeitschriftfzir die gesamte Staa/swissenschaft (i896, Heft I-IV), to which are added I50 pages of introduction, notes, and supplements. What Shubert-Soldern contemplates, is an investigation of the psychological basis of political economy in gen- eral. He contrasts his work with Schaffle's "B Eau zind Leben des sacia/et Kiirpers, " and supposes that Schjffle regards political economy more from the external standpoint of social physiology and anatomy, while he himself views it " from the comprehensive standpoint of the epistemologist and psychologist." The introduction contains an ex- position of the author's general philosophical point of view, while the work itself deals with individual happiness in general, insight and self- control, social happiness, nature, and culture, the concepts of work, capital, and value, as well as the development, the concept and division of property. It is a piece of good and thorough work that Schubert- Soldern has given us; acute and penetrating psychological analysis and clear delimination of concepts. He goes back to the elementary psychic facts, which form the basis of political economy, and at the same time he endeavors to retain everywhere the connection with the methodological principles of epistemology. In my opinion, this is the only way in which philosophy can be of service to sociology and political economy. If it restricts itself to this task, it remains within the limits of its own proper domain. And one will not-as would be justifiable in other circumstances-reproach it for trespassing and un- warranted meddling, but will cordially welcome and invite its coopera- tion. ERICH ADICKES.
