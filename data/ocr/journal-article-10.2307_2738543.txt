Sterne's relationship to the scientific thought of his age is, surprisingly, a neglected topic. Even though Sterne himself said his novel attacked the weak part of the sciences, few critics have taken him at his word. Yet as Loveridge demonstrates, knowledge of the scientific background illumi- nates Sterne's use of the association of ideas, helps to put Sterne's rela- tionship to John Locke in its proper perspective, and adds considerably to the understanding of Sterne's sentimentalism. In his early chapters, Loveridge argues the proposition that Sterne is a novelist whose interest in the design argument is a concomitant of his interest in novelistic conventions. Tristram Shandy is an entirely typical novel, the first volume of which is concerned with the relationship of plot and character, not plot as story-line (which it so lacks), but plot as "a force ... preliminary to the events of a novel ... plot in the sense of conspiracy ... a general force" (p. 31). Critics who see in Sterne's novel "firm order behind or alongside of the apparent chaos of the psychological flux" (p. 33) forget, says Loveridge, that all the leitmotifs and symbols are part of Tristram's character and that Tristram's "more persistent analogies and metaphors" reflect the instability of a world where analogy has become "demonic" (p. 39). Loveridge cautiously takes his notion of the design argument from Mar- tin Battestin's essay, "Tom Jones: The Argument of Design," in Essays Presented to Louis Landa, ed. H. K. Miller, E. Rothstein and G. S. Rous- seau (1970), and he is careful not to base his enquiry on oversimplifications of either the novelist or his background. Loveridge is aware that the re- lationship of text and background in Sterne's novels is complex: "A par- ticular metaphor will have material arranged around it in such a way as to suggest that there is a correspondence or figurative relationship between the real, public world (what might be called the world of published knoiwl- edge) and the world of fiction: and the metaphor will draw attention to both worlds at once" (p. 59). One example, the "blow of fate" metaphor (the cluster of references to gravity, the blow Toby receives from the cannonball and the blows received by other characters) suggests that "ma- terial in Tristram Shandy which appears to be of very local interest only ... has unexpected connections with some of the leading general ideas that are used in the construction of the book" (p. 69). In an interesting third chapter, Loveridge pursues the links between Tristram Shandy's hobbyhorsicality and Newtonian mechanics. Though not hobbyhorsical himself, Newton provoked hobbyhorsical reactions in others (p. 71). In an age which thought mechanically and scientifically, Newton's law of gravity animated the universe, "as if it were some sentient, self-regulating organisation, rather than a grand, impersonal machine" (p.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 249 72). Newton's law of gravity anthropomorphised the cosmos and gave a new respectability to those who wished the scientific method to discover "analogies, harmonies and agreements" (p. 73) in the natural world. Even though Tristram Shandy clearly feigns a lack of design, Sterne's specific interest in the association of ideas betrays, says Loveridge, his interest in analogy and correspondence. Furthermore, eighteenth-century associationism evolved from "medical principles" which "in themselves are not associationist in character, but which are based directly on the analogy with Newton" (p. 76). Loveridge describes "a tradition of popular science" (1690-1740) and brings to our attention the full context of Sterne's use of the association of ideas in his novel, hitherto overlooked by readers of Tristram Shandy. Sterne is aware of both the strengths and the weaknesses of the associationist position and Loveridge notices Tristram stealing some of his phrasing from two associationists in particular, William King and David Hartley (pp. 88-89). Loveridge's fourth chapter analyses Tristram Shandy, Volume III, where he finds numerous examples of small systems collapsing, evidence of Sterne's desire to portray the comedy inherent in the design argument. Evidence of a cosmic plan and a cosmic planner clearly cannot be inferred from the domestic lives of the Shandies. Cosmic collapse is never far away in Sterne's novel, and "Tristram's rhetoric" is a constant reminder, remarks Loveridge, of the "universal bananaskin" (p. 115). Loveridge's last three chapters make better reading than his first four. He is brief and interesting in Chapter 5 on the subject of "Sterne and Locke." Locke is associated with Toby. Loveridge assembles the textual echoes to prove it. In the "Author's Preface," always difficult for any reader of Sterne, Tristram feigns opposition to Locke but is opposed only to cliche interpretations of him. One of Locke's great virtues, after all, was that he didn't care for the unshakeable belief in analogical argument current in his day. Loveridge is worth reading attentively here although he stops short at: "The only pattern he [Tristram] is left with is God's pattern ... It is the only pattern for which he has any real respect ... his respect is man- ifested in his unwillingness to argue from it" (p. 150). I was left wondering how this respect could be deduced, considering it is so conspicuous by its absence. The centrepiece of Chapter 6, "Sympathy and Sentiment," is Love- ridge's reading of the Sermon in Volume II of Tristram Shandy. Sterne, he argues, is well aware of the "tension" that existed between the cultural background of sentimentalism, the Latitudinarians, Cambridge Platonists, Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, and the "more scientific background to sen- timent" (p. 153). The former created a positive climate of opinion for sentiment, the latter laid bare its "radical amorality." Sterne is aware of both attributes of sympathy. Loveridge then ignores the positive (infa- mous?) side of Sterne's sentimentalism (Le Fever's Tale) and analyses the sermon instead. The sermon's argument is undermined by a reflex reaction, Trim's sentiment. Trim's exact pose is shattered at the close of the reading,</page><page sequence="3">250 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES and his response affects Slop first and then, ultimately, the foetus Tristram. Loveridge's account of the sermon is one of the most interesting I have encountered. I also found interesting his chapter on A Sentimental Journey which concludes the book. Armed with his realisation that Sterne's sentimen- talism is more of a "problem" than a "doctrine," Loveridge argues that it is written against the sermons and all naive belief in correspondences. Yorick is so convinced that others feel exactly as he does that he identifies his feelings with the controlling forces of the world. Loveridge's interesting analysis (pp. 190-92) of the famous "sensorium" passage reveals Yorick's gradual descent into "mere anthropomorphism." Yorick has much in common, Loveridge argues, with the Earl of Shaftes- bury: "It emerges that the relations between Shaftesbury and his world have the same problematic and quixotic quality as the relation between Yorick and his" (p. 195). Once again the analysis is convincing, and so are the observations on the differences between Yorick and Tristram, which are glossed by reference to Edmund Burke's Philosophical Enquiry (1759), a treatise which is fully aware, like Tristram, that opinions (words) not things influence our passions. If Yorick had been more aware, he might have grasped the "tension" inherent in sentimentalism and some of the limitations of his vision. Fiction, after all, continues Loveridge, illuminates the writer's mind as much as the world itself. Tristram realises this, but Yorick doesn't. Yorick is an unadulterated reader of life preconditioned to sentiment by his environment and unable to sense the limitations of his position. There is a doubleness of vision in Yorick which his readers can discern because Sterne has carefully arranged his book to allow us to see it. The strength of Loveridge's book lies in its realisation (reinforced by Eric Rothstein's Systems of Order and Enquiry in Later Eighteenth-Cen- tury Fiction, 1975) that analogy is important to an understanding of Sterne's work. The investigations into the scientific background to analogy are informative. Its weakness lies in its own verbal fabric. Almost all of the book's recurrent deficiencies of style can be traced to Loveridge's imprecise choice of verbs. He invariably favours verbs with prepositions, humdrum verbs ("go along with," "to back up," "to reflect back on" and the tired variations of the verb "to get") that should have been rejected in favour of more vigorous language during the years when he must have been revising his doctoral thesis for publication. The long gap between the date when Loveridge appears to have stopped reading criticism, 1975, the date of his Preface, "January 1980," and the date of publication, 1982, makes one wonder if the manuscript was revised much during these years, es- pecially when he explains in the Preface that Eric Rothstein's study came "Rather late in the day" (1975) for him to engage it in critical discussion. Although he lists in his bibliography Wilfred Watson's unpublished thesis "Sterne's Satire on Mechanism" (1951), one of the few works to investigate Sterne's scientific background, Loveridge does not discuss it. There is a</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 251 double disappointment here because Watson's noble (but strained) attempt to read the whole of Tristram Shandy in the light of the history of ideas contrasts with Loveridge's concentration on the first three volumes of Tris- tram Shandy. Mark Loveridge's book is a useful one nevertheless, despite its stylistic mannerisms, quirky moments, and confined approach to Tris- tram Shandy. RICHARD A.
