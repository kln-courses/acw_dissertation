<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Religion and Health, Vol. 21, No. 4, Winter 1982 Toward a Theology of Healing JAMES N. STUDER ABSTRACT: A sense of magic has always permeated our theology of healing. Consider the fol lowing theses: 1. By the very nature of material creation, however mysteriously it was initiated and is sustained, the power of God to influence material creation is restricted to the immanent (from within) and indirect; 2. God does not arbitrarily, in the case of two persons who have "iden tical" illnesses, decide the recovery of one and the death of the other. Rather, his love bears equal ly on all. This study will defend these theses and show that they are foundational and integral, to a theology of primarily physical healing. Hospital patients, particularly those who become seriously ill, say: "Why me?" "I know I'm being punished." "I can't find any meaning in this." "Why doesn't God take me?" "There's a miracle around the corner, I just know it." Or those who have had a temporary remission from serious disease say: "Why didn't God take me before?when I was resigned to dying?" "My friend got well from this, why not me?" Or relatives say: "Why did my daughter die of cancer?" "Why this? He's been a good man." Every professional in health care has heard these assertions or questions from people who become seriously ill. Chaplains in hospitals may hear them most. They reveal some of the most common misunderstandings about who and what we are, the general nature of illness, and our relationship with God. Although it is often too late for people to learn by the time illness sets in, health care professionals can profitably probe the reasons for these questions and declarations to understand more deeply the falsity of many of the assump tions upon which they are based. We already sense that some of those ques tions and declarations are based more upon emotional reaction than upon thought. I assert at once that we may often expect only variations of reduction of this imbalance that causes so much needless suffering; to "turn it around" completely is usually impossible in the time available for pastoral care. How ever, Erich Fromm's demonstration that thought can train emotion1 jus tifies the present attempt to probe the real reasons for these questions and declarations. James N.

Studer 281 The combined purposes of this study are to identify and analyze briefly some of the false premises that generate the above questions and declarations; to substitute premises that are more in accord both with scholarly interpretation of Scriptures and theological tradition on the one hand and with interpretation of the world around us on the other; to suggest directional adjustments that might be made in basic catechetics and in pastoral care. The study also intends to encourage aU health care professionals who are confronted with suffering questions of the kind noted to participate more intelUgently in the pastoral care into which their own professional care often leads them. But before that, what is theology, and what is meant by a theology of heal ing? Of many ways of saying what theology is, take this one: faith seeking understanding. And a theology of heaUng simply emphasizes faith seeking understanding within our desire to get well from an iUness. Don't be put off, therefore, by the vague fear that "theology" is strange, or too difficult. None of us knows aU about "biology" either, but we know some and can learn more. Neither be put off by the impression that faith is one thing and theology another. A highly knowledgeable person has written, "Every formulation of faith has resulted from theological reflection"; the truth of this can be demon strated. Pursuit of the purposes mentioned wiU evolve below in five parts: a statement of two declarations or theses to focus the objective of the study; definition and analysis of the human condition (anthropological, sociological, psychological, and other); and definition and analysis of our relationship with God (theologi cal). What conclusions can we draw? What questions must stiU be asked? Theses The foUowing two assertions or declarations will give us sufficient scope for exploration, while focusing our attention on heaUng despite reference to much broader issues in human concern. 1. By the very nature of material creation, however mysteriously it was initi ated and is sustained, the power of God to influence material creation is restricted to the immanent (from within) and indirect. The order and dynamic of matter, in being and motion, are constitutive of matter. 2. God does not arbitrarily, in the case of two persons who have "identical" iUnesses, decide the recovery of one and the death of the other. Rather, his love bears equaUy on aU. This study wiU defend these theses and show that they are foundational, integral to a theology of heaUng. The human condition This immensely broad term refers to every aspect of human Ufe: to its origins; to its present physical form and its environmental setting; to the interplay of</page><page sequence="3">282 Journal of Religion and Health mind, will, emotion, and body within the individual person; to the relationship of person in family, friends, and larger entities of society. Each of these aspects has a vital bearing on the contraction of illness and on how to get well. Origins. The time has passed for this casual attitude: "Evolution of man and woman from lower forms of life is interesting, but after all it is only a theory." These bodies of ours grew, ultimately, out of the star dust like everything else around us. When spokesmen of stature in the scientific community define clearly how this generally happened, we ignore them at the same peril as churchmen once ignored Galileo. The religion of these scientists does not mat ter. Neither did Galileo's. In order to understand what lies behind illness and what it takes to get well, it is just as necessary to accept our having evolved from origins deep in time as it is for us to accept a round earth instead of a flat one. The evidence is equally strong. Man and woman were not inserted by magic into creation. The Genesis story, enormously important and irreplace able myth, may not be used as a scientific treatise for description of material fact. We grew out of a simpler creation, no matter at the moment the details. Any lingering fear that belief in our evolution somehow demeans us or blas phemes God must be left to those whose emotions deter them from using their intellectual powers. Present environmental setting. I stress heavily simple and full acceptance of evolution in the section above precisely because John or Jane who becomes seriously ill takes virtually none of such awareness into the illness. The "Why me?" and all variations of, "I know there is (or can be) a miracle around the corner" reflect implicit but effective rejection of belief in our evolution and its multitude of implications. I assert this despite the probability that emotion, primarily, initially causes these declarations. The "Why me?" reflects, in part, fear of divine punishment for many people (I shall refer to this again). But it reflects, as well, failure to recognize the pri mary source of the weakness to which "flesh is heir." Nature has been working its way forward in this world for some awesome four and a half billion years. That development, two steps forward, one back, has pursued an infinity of dead-end roads within the broadest possible meaning of the term "natural selection." Nature, despite its majesty, struggles with changes and defor mities. Blight strikes plants and animals. The growth of one organism means the disease of another. Despite the controls that man has imposed on his envi ronment, the random onslaught of accident and disease bespeaks little other than conformity to the nature within which man has grown as an integral part. The "Why me?" mirrors chiefly John's and Jane's failure before illness to take deep, reflective note of this. This superficial grasp of our setting in the world around us reflects itself still more clearly in variations of belief that God can regulate or prevent accident and disease directly and instantaneously if he so chooses. How is this possible? Consider (1). Mt. St. Helen's blows, and death and widespread suffering followed. Whether it is this volcano that erupts or another in the vicinity of the Juan de Fuca plate (killing fewer, or more, people) is ultimately a random affair of nature. Some insurance policies may still label this event an "act of God,"</page><page sequence="4">James N. Studer 283 but we are no longer deceived. Or when rain clouds shift from South Dakota, which needs rain, and rain on Minnesota, which also needs rain, we do not beUeve God made a direct decision. We may stiU continue to pray in our litur gies for rain, but even the moderately informed neither beUeve God wiU (can) shift the rain to us from others who need it; nor do they beUeve he wiU (can) pick up an extra cloud from somewhere and bring it over. They pray to satisfy a conventional ritual, while being reasonably certain that rain occurs within general patterns of natural cause and effect which God does not directly gov ern. They accept, in effect, a certain randomness in such natural events. (2). A coyote jumps on a ground squirrel and tears it apart; or, to bring it closer to home, a Doberman jumps on John's beloved poodle and does the same. We do not beUeve God would (could) have prevented that. We would concede that random opportunity led to what coyotes and some dogs do. (3). John's poodle contracts an infection. He takes him to the veterinarian, and the dog receives the most modern animal care possible?but he dies anyway. Again, we would hesitate to claim that God might (could) have cured the dog. Rather, in sympa thizing with John's sense of loss, we would stiU be wilUng to concede that a risk of fatal disease, randomly imposed to a great extent on the dog, led quite simply to forces for its death winning out over those for Ufe. (4). John, aged 64 and in good health, contracts an infection. He is rushed to the hospital and receives the most modern care possible. His pastor and family and friends aU pray for him. Although he skirts death for a time, he finaUy recovers. (5). Jane, also 64 and in good health, contracts an infection. She is rushed to the hospital and receives the most modern care possible. Her pastor and family and friends aU pray for her. She skirts death for a time and finaUy dies. (6). Henry, aged 85 and in relatively good health, (etc., as above) dies soon after being hospitaUzed. What new elements have crept into the picture? John and Jane were the same age and in good health and had "identical" ?lnesses. Why did John recover and Jane die? Why did not God heal Jane? Could he have done so? Why did Henry die more quickly than Jane? Could God have healed Henry? The whole human person; interplay of mind, will, emotion, body. Essentially, new elements crept into the progressive ?lustrations above because we began considering the height of creation, the self-reflecting, basicaUy free, decision making creature, the human person. He combines visible nature?electrons, atoms, molecules, Umbs, and an animal body with the random aspects of being and motion that characterize aU nature, including susceptibiUty to disease and inevitable cycUcal death?with the invisible reaUty of mind, spirit, wiU, emo tion by which we recognize the unique human personaUty. We speak analo gously of the personaUties of our pets or of the birds that come regularly to the feeder, but we know we are in a higher dimension with the self-aware, decision making human person. We readily concede (and we aU know examples of it) that the human person can add a measure to getting weU by his positive atti tude. "Mind over matter," we say. And we recognize that study of the brain mind reveals increasingly the immense human potential for self-influence. Despite the many impUcations of this brief and general emphasis on human vitaUty and its untapped potential, reUgious people beUeve that God's loving</page><page sequence="5">284 Journal of Religion and Health care affects them. And rightly so, as this study also asserts. The above sec tions have asserted the power of the human role primarily to dispel a simplistic notion that God can square a circle. God and his relation to creation Adequate related explanations characteristically overlap. This section will necessarily repeat and enlarge upon some aspects of sections above. 1. "God is love. " (1 John 4:16 and many other passages in the Scriptures, e.g., Psalms 102 and 111; Romans 8:38, 39) This is both a sufficient and an all encompassing revelation. AU other revelation flows from this basic reality. That is, God's omnipotence, omniscience, and absoluteness are his love. They are not qualities of his being which result in action in opposition to his love.2 We say that the multitude of expressions that refer to God's power or wrath are "anthropomorphic." That is, they ascribe human attributes to God. Noth ing wrong with that. We need to do so to clarify our thinking. To refer to God as "love" is also anthropomorphic, as is ultimately any human expression. However, reference to God as "love" in its many variations represents the overwhelming thrust of revelation. It also describes the ultimate reality of deity without which faith and trust within any human experience are impossible.3 2. Love results in life and creativity. God initiated creation and sustains it from within. Human life resulted from and is augmented by this creativity. The human person is basically free through his power to think and to decide, yet is limited not only by social structure but by the nature of material crea tion in which he participates by his body. 3. If the statement "God is love" wholly describes God,* then he does not arbitrarily decide the death of one sick person and the recovery of another. (Neither, for the same reason, did he impose the illness.) The "human condi tion" in part describes the double dimension of the state of mind and body. In addition to the multitude of bodily conditions (life and death forces in opposi tion), John has (can have) an ascending degree of mind force at play, and that for life. We call it a "positive attitude." That force for life centers first on this life, but transcends it toward eternal life if countervailing bodily forces toward death prevail in his illness. We can refer to this human thrust to transcendence as "spirit." Moreover, tradition teaches that precisely in the realm of spirit God "lays hold of us." And he offers his loving, creative power toward contin ued life in a special way in our context of healing. God works in medical and nursing staffs. He works in all support persons as we (the church) pray that John may get well "in mind and body" (prayer of anointing, Roman rite).6 Through John's positive outlook and prayer, sup ported by the prayer of others, God develops in John by some "augmented psychological intensity" the maximum serenity of spirit and acceptance of divine caring and force for healing of which this concrete circumstance of ill ness is capable. The history of healing provides dramatic examples of radical reversal of bodily condition in some circumstances. Correct understanding of</page><page sequence="6">James N. Studer 285 the circumstances demands that we accept that these reversals of bocUly con dition have come about in the general way described above, not from direct intervention by God to rearrange a bodily condition. If that assertion seems to strain the credible, look at Karl Rahner's assertion in 1965: "Whenever God expresses himself outside the beatific vision, he does so through a work or event that belongs to the finite and the creaturely."6 What conclusions can we draw ? 1. First, why is it so important to labor the points at issue? Quite simple. And we come back to the question and declarations that opened this study. Until catechesis convinces John and Jane (anyone who falls seriously iU) of the above, they wiU experience, at some stage, fear that God is punishing them with the iUness; flounder unnecessarily through the dilemma of "Why me?"; rage at God (at some stage or in some instances) for arbitrarily making them or letting them be iU and maybe die (which does not deprecate the benefit of vent ing rage if it does occur); build, then reject, then build again, etc., unfounded hope for recovery?all within unnecessarily bUnd faith that God does care for them. Other concrete and unnecessarily stressful psychological and spiritual states can be detailed. For example, an unusuaUy perceptive patient in all other ways wonders why God did not "take her" when she was resigned to dy ing, instead of giving her a temporary remission after which she has to become resigned all over again. 2. The warranty for investigation of the problems sketched above deserves further explanation. It Ues in the constant exercise of "faith seeking under standing," that is, theology. "Faith" for the moment should not be aUowed unneeded baggage. Let it mean at this point that God exists and loves us. The theologian takes the best interpretation of the scholars of the Scriptures, takes note of what the traditions say, and expresses the impUcations of the Scrip tures for his own day. The theologian does not write for yesterday, but for to day and the future. It is his task to make the Bible real in today's world. He must, therefore, know the world and all its significance in everyday Ufe. Further: The theologian's task is not simply to repeat what the official magisterium has already said, or even to expound and defend what has already become official teaching, but even more importantly, to discover what has not yet been taught.7 It is his task both to conserve the traditional patrimony and to interpret its thrust forward.8 Moreover, he does not content himself with quoting "proof" Scriptures or with repeating statements from historical documents without evaluating the historical stresses of the time, to see whether truth must be expressed in differing terms in today's world.9 And stiU further, he may not accept as mysterious what may be understood. "Secularism's gift to modern</page><page sequence="7">286 Journal of Religion and Health religion is the fact that religious traditions must now make sense in some way, or be abandoned."10 The charge on the theologian is a heavy one. As much as can be, he must be a universalist. Yet he must rely on the witness of professionals in their own dis ciplines, and to the degree in which these professionals have developed consen sus on any point or genre of knowledge: on the exegete for his knowledge of what the authors of Scripture meant, on the medical doctor for his knowledge of the body, on the biochemist for his knowledge of the protein molecule and the human cell, on the astronomer for his knowledge of the universe. He enjoys no divine inspiration which substitutes for that reliance. Most of his knowl edge of today's world will derive from the reports of these experts. He must particularly rely on wide consensus within the empirical sciences about the location, characteristics, and function of elements of the material world. No knowledge is dangerous. His perspective will remind him of faith seeking understanding, not understanding seeking faith. 3. Wide consensus in the scientific community attests to nature's "conduct of its own affairs." We see it best illustrated at the vastly diverging ends of the spectrum of matter. Jacques Monod, French Nobel Prize biochemist, speaks for the microlevel when he asserts: Finally, on the microscopic level there exists a further source of still more radical uncer tainty embedded in the quantum structure of matter. A mutation is in itself a microscopic event, a quantum event, to which the principle of uncertainty applies. An event which is hence and by its very nature essentially unpredictable.11 On the other end of the spectrum, whether the two great Magellanic clouds in the distant sky will one day merge lies entirely in the random, yet generally ordered events of the larger universe.12 So also for the major matter of entropy and the possible eventual self-destruction of the universe.13 The assertion is not new. Thomas Huxley stated it generally in 1863.u Dr. Arthur Peacocke, in responding particularly to Monod's report, con cedes the proper domain of the scientist when he states: However, the contemporary Christian theist in stressing the immanent creativity of God in the cosmos must recognize that it is by the "laws" and through the regularities of nature that God must be presumed to be working.... This potentiality [of creativ ity] is not injected into the cosmos from "outside" either by God or by a Life Force, ?lan vital or other supposedly "supernatural" agency.16 There is no "God of the Gaps." Neither does the old theistic "argument from design" hold water.16 Further, the popular and devout but mistaken belief that God can intervene from "outside" to heal the body instantaneously may simply trace to the "baptism" of an old pagan belief, accepted because no one then could have known the material world as we now know it. 4. Careful distinction must be made between what is and what it means. As stated above, the theologian must accept the witness of empirical science about what is in the material world. What it means is quite another matter.</page><page sequence="8">James N. Studer 287 The interpretation of the meaning of material reaUty faUs to other talents in us than the power of observation of what Ues "out there," to the poet, the musi cian, the philosopher, and the theologian. Some scientists may conclude as has Monod, "Immanence is aUen to modern science. Destiny is written concur rently with the event, not prior to it."17 When they so conclude, they exceed their credentials as physical scientists and become fair game for those more qualifed to interpret the meaning of what is. The theologian sees God as immanent in the cosmos and in man in particular. Peacocke asserts the complementarity of theological and scientific perspectives. The Christian theological interpretation complements and develops the scientific account in the significance it attributes to these events in human history. Moreover, the theological perspective, if accepted, gives meaning to the present, and a sense of direction for the future to a world st?l regarded as in process and as the matrix of new emergent forms of human Ufe.17 5. The overwhelming weight of responsibiUty for the opposition between theology and science seems to faU upon the age-old misunderstanding of what the Bible can, and intends to, teach. Were we able to expunge from the history of its interpretation the conviction that it intended to and could teach that God can and sometimes does arbitrarily rearrange matter directly, then tech nology and science might work in harmony for man's spiritual enlightenment. Devout beUevers who become seriously iU could put mind-spirit to the opti mum cooperation with the loving, creative power of God in them for heaUng, unencumbered by false fears and hopes. 6. In view of the above, then, we must remind ourselves that, "By faith we perceive that the universe was fashioned by the word of God, so that the vis ible came forth from the invisible." (Hebrews 11:3) Moreover, ". . .we have been justified through faith." (Romano 5:1) And, "Christ died for us while we were yet sinners, and that is God's own proof of his love toward us." (Romans 5:8) No subject is more difficult to get straight than faith. God grants us the gift of faith, to "see" him as the invisible behind the visible. He does not grant us the gift of magic that he would do, or that might be done in his name. Magic means the supposed arbitrary rearrangement of physical matter. But "The kingdom is not coming with signs to be observed." (Luke 17:20) God's proof of his love for us is that Christ died for us. We join those who cried in derision, "Let him come down from the cross and then we wiU beUeve him." (Mt 27:42), when we demand magic in signs and wonders. A "simple" faith, often only thin gruel, needs this understanding. It needs to ask questions.18 To be alive it must face doubt.19 To Uve the truth it must reject the desire for magic which is the denial of history and is the ultimate sentimentaUty. Any teaching authority bears a grave burden to be open to truth, as yet not sufficiently emphasized, or as yet never taught. Without the reinvigorated guidance of teachers in the churches, John and Jane wiU continue to look out from the hospital bed in pained bewilderment and ask, "Why me?"</page><page sequence="9">288 Journal of Religion and Health Open questions The above is only a sketchy, initial overview of the how and why of sickness, healing, and acceptance of possible death. Some related issues and questions not even noted or touched only lightly: 1. The significance of the Incarnation and Resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth for Christians. They believe that God became the man Jesus, "... and the Word became flesh." (John 1:14; both the Revised Standard and New American Bible versions) 2. How interpret the healing texts in the Scriptures and the tradition of mir acles? How does the popular understanding of miracle accord with the nature and role of Sacrament? Exegetes and theologians press for recasting our understanding.20 3. Do we have an adequate "theology of the body"? 4. How does the Bible guide us toward the extent to which we should try to understand our relationship to God? Consider the following two biblical passages: Oh Lord. . . my eyes are not raised too high; I do not occupy myself with things too great and marvelous for me. (Psalm 131) Let us know, let us press on to know the Lord. (Hosea 6:3) Are these passages in conflict? If so, how do we handle the conflict? 5. How do we think our way out of the following dilemma? On the one hand, we believe that God is "all-powerful" or "almighty," that he has some unimag inably great power to regulate natural events and human affairs if he chooses to do so. On the other hand, we believe he loves us too (all people), but we see suffering and death go on in the world of a kind and to an extent that totally conflict with what even a loving human person would allow if he or she could alleviate the pain. (Sidney Lens once responded to a remark by Bill Moyers, "Oh, that's a description of God: all power and no responsibility!") 6. How do we teach successfully th^t myth, "an interpretation of mystery,"21 nurtures our sense of identity, helps to explain the meaning of material reality? 7. It has been pointed out again recently that suffering can rob one of faith.22 To what extent could the present discussion illuminate traditional expositions on the "mystery of evil, suffering, and death"? 8. Research on brain-mind hurries onward. How may physical science, psy chology, philosophy, and theology cooperate so that the sick person may take full advantage of the human potential of brain-mind-spirit toward healing? 9. How may currently well-developed methods of mind and memory healing therapy and prayer profit from accepting the expertise of the physical sciences? 10. God heals by way of love, faith, and prayer. But in what way is the human person able to perceive this? Or does the matter always remain in the realm of faith? Or what is the nature of the unique and personal "synapse" between God and this sick person?</page><page sequence="10">James N. Studer 289 References 1. Fromm, E., The Art of Loving.
