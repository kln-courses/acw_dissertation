<plain_text><page sequence="1">Beatriz Rivera-Barnes Yuyos Are Not Weeds An Ecocritical Approach to Horacio Quiroga The yuyo is in fact a weed. But the literary critic Emir Rodriguez Monegal recalls that Horacio Quiroga once told him that the yuyo was not a weed, but rather a plant that was not in its natural place. So, Rodriguez Monegal concludes that, away from the jungle, Quiroga felt like a yuyo, and that in the jungle he became a colossal tropical plant (11). In an initial attempt to conceptualize place-connectedness and to argue for the importance of place-sense in literary imagination, Lawrence Buell alludes to a passage in James Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man where Stephen Dedalus scribbles in his geogra- phy textbook first his name, then his class, his school, his county, his country, his continent, then finally the world and the universe (Writing for an Endangered World 64). This is Buell's first model for place-connectedness in a five-fold analysis. Regardless of the fact that he soon declares that first model to be partially obsolete, were a similar expanding/contracting succession to be applied to Horacio Quiroga, it could be much like this: Horacio Quiroga, his house, his patch of land between the Upper Paraná River and the town of San Ignacio, Misiones Province, Argentina, South America, the world, the universe. But the succession that interests me here begins with the province of Misiones and ends with Horacio Quiroga and his sense of place, that particular place. From 1903 until he took his own life in 1937, Quiroga was obsessed with a place: Misiones, the Argentine tropical frontier. Thus, Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 16.1 (Winter 2009) doi:10.1093/isle/isn021 © The Author(s) 2009.

For that reason alone, Quiroga warrants an ecocritical approach. Before proceeding any further, I would like to mention that as far as terminology goes, I hesitated between ecocriticism and environ- mental criticism upon reading that "[. . .] ecocriticism still invokes in some quarters the cartoon image of a club of intellectually shallow nature worshippers, an image slapped on the movement during its salad days" (Buell, The Future of Environmental Criticism viii). Counting on those salad days being over, or nearly over, I finally opted for ecocriticism. In broad terms, Cheryll Glotfelty defines ecocriticism as "[...] the study of the relationship between literature and the physical environ- ment" (xviii). So, the ecocritical approach to Horacio Quiroga begins with this relationship. Initially, there is Quiroga's relationship with nature, an intense and obsessive one, and the stories that are the result of this relationship. The stories, in turn, portray not only the conflicts and dynamics between man and the physical environment, as well as how nature responds to man's presence in the jungle, but also convey, as Jennifer French affirms, "[. . .] the intense relationships among land, labor and capital in the colonial jungle, where the power exerted by metropolitan capital extracts surplus value by deforming beyond all reason the 'natural' interaction between local people and their environment" (54-55). For example, in the story El regreso de Anaconda (1925), it is not so much the local farmer, but rather the logging company that rep- resents the power of capital. But the spirit of the place is not always aware of this imbalance of power, so the animals quickly come to see one dying laborer as representative of all the exploiters. Politically speaking, all of the animals except Anaconda end up confusing labor and capital. But in spite of the animals' confusion and of the need to separate labor from capital, it is important to keep in mind that the local farmer cannot help but do his share of cutting and burning and of making a fragile environment all the more fragile. In fact, the tourist who is merely there to see and the preservation- ist who is there to protect also have their impact on the environment. These impacts can be measured either with scientific rigor or with metaphors. Nature can respond any number of ways: with erosion, with storms, with floods, with droughts, with deluges. Quiroga conveys this by having the animals of the tropical zone plotting against man and planning to blockade the upper Paraná River.</page><page sequence="3">Yuyos Are Not Weeds 37 In other words, nature can respond with anthropomorphic meta- phors, by becoming man's mortal enemy. Anaconda alludes to the first man who arrived in the jungle, "con su miserable ansia de ver, tocar, y cortar"and then to the other men who followed, "sucios de olor, sucios de machetes y quemazones incesantes" [with his mis- erable urge to see, to touch, and to cut]; [dirty-smelling, with dirty machetes and incessant burnings] (Quiroga, Desterrados 4 7).1 Anaconda's discourse, however, does not limit these jungle stories to the dialectics of the greedy capitalist and fragile nature, or pitiless nature and the hapless tract farmer. The dynamics between man and the physical environment are explored in depth through the different perspectives, for this Argentine tropical frontier was peopled by Brazilian squatters, all kinds of drunken foreigners, pioneers like Quiroga himself, large-scale loggers and farmers, colonial oppressors, and peons, as well as charismatic anacondas who use labor union language, impulsive caimans, and concerned, insightful fox terriers. "In fact," Robert Eidt points out, "by 1881, the Argentine public had begun to think of Misiones as a sort of international refugium peccatorum- quite a contrast with the thriving centers of Indian agriculture and industry that had supported some 50,000 people in the Campo during Jesuit times" (82). If Quiroga first ventured into the tropical forest, it was to see. He was considered to be a dandy at the time, a dandy from Uruguay, a country that lacked native culture or local color, as critic Perez Martin points out (91). This is an important detail in that it reflects Lawrence Buell's second model for place -sense: "To understand fully what it means to inhabit place is therefore not only to bear in mind the (dis)connectedness between one's primary places but also the tenticular radiations from each one" ( Writing for an Endangered World 66). In other words, it is necessary to keep in mind that Quiroga was not from the region that obsessed him. He came from somewhere else; his identity was ineluctably entangled with other places. The first encounter with the jungle would change the dandy's way of seeing the world. Instantly, the place moved Quiroga deeply, and he must have felt much like Paul Bowles when he first arrived in Algeria, his own magic place which he felt would give him "wisdom and ecstasy- perhaps even death" (125). From that moment on, Quiroga's works would be imbibed with what he saw, and with his desire to return. What Quiroga saw in the jungle, be it the jungle itself or his own self in the jungle, attracted him, but before long he was as anxious to touch and to cut as was the first man who ventured into the jungle. So, the question may very well be: does man</page><page sequence="4">38 ISLE invariably do this to a beloved place? But it can also be: what is it that a beloved place does to man? The opportunity to see first came to Horacio Quiroga in June 1903, when his friend, the poet Leopoldo Lugones, was sent by the Argentine Ministry of Education to the Jesuit ruins of San Ignacio in the province of Misiones, and Quiroga decided to accompany him as a photographer. The two friends went up the Paraná River to this place that would forever have an impact on Quiroga. This is where Quiroga's lifelong attraction to the jungle begins: "Para Quiroga sig- nifico el primer contacto con un mundo en que existía otra escala de valores, un mundo que lo facinaba por su aparente impenetrabilidad, que desafiaba su espíritu competitivo" [For Quiroga this was the first contact with a world where another set of values existed, a world that fascinated him because of its impenetrability that challenged his competitive spirit] (Rodriguez Monegal 79-80). In spite of his insufferable attitude during the entire expedition, Quiroga discovered almost immediately the spirit of Robinson Crusoe within himself.2 Henceforth, the environment would play a crucial role in his writing. Not only was Quiroga intent on making the tropical forest his habitat, but also on telling its stories. In this way Quiroga is much like his protagonist Juan Brown whose initial intention was to see the ruins of San Ignacio and who ended up spending the next quarter century of his life there: "Así Juan Brown, que habiendo ido por sólo imas horas a mirar las ruinas, se quedó veinticinco años allá" (Desterrados 65). In other words, the act of seeing made both Quiroga and his protagonist want to touch, to appropriate, and to do so, they had to cut and to burn. But in 1903, Quiroga's eyes are only seeing, and seeing for the first time. No need to touch, not yet. There are the columns of the ruins and the gigantic roots of the canopy trees growing together, forming what Rodriguez Monegal calls mestizo structures, half tree, half column, which the natives called corazón de piedra (80). These parti- cular ruins are the vestiges of one of 11 settlements or missions established by the Jesuits between 1609 and 1767 and which account for the name of the province. But the Jesuits were not the first to see and to touch this subtropical area of land in northeast Argentina nestled between three rivers, the Upper Paraná to the west, the Iguazú to the north, and the Uruguay to the south. In 1525, Sebastien Cabot was sent there by Charles V in search of a legendary, wealthy "White King" of this region inhabited by the Guaraní people. This expedition was followed by Pedro de Mendoza's in 1536. Then, in 1541, Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca also explored the area. He navigated down the Upper Paraná River, past</page><page sequence="5">Yuyos Are Not Weeds 39 Misiones, all the way to Asunción, Paraguay. "During the next forty years," Eidt writes, "settlers in Asunción kept the Paraná-Paraguay river system open to shipping and gradually probed south and east toward the densely forested region of Misiones" (35). The presence of the native Guaraní, the initial European settlements, and the arrival of the Jesuits reflect Buell's third dimension of place-sense. For "[. . .] places themselves are not stable, free-standing entities but continually shaped and reshaped by forces both inside and outside. Places haves histories; place is not just a noun but also a verb [. . .] (Writing for an Endangered World 67). The geography proves to be just as fluid as the cultural artifacts and the history. Eidt writes that the terrain, the soil, the climate, and the vegetation all emphasize the transitional nature of this region. For example, "Level to rolling lands of the Campo rise to hills and moun- tains in the Selva" (Eidt 7). It is to this seemingly virgin forest that Quiroga will return almost immediately, this time in order to touch and to cut. It is not to the province of Misiones, however, that Quiroga returns in 1904, but to the Argentine Chaco. Rodriguez Monegal sees a subtle error in Quiroga's choice of place and explains this as Quiroga's need of a false acculturation before discovering the true one. In other words, the discovery of his true habitat or country could only be the result of trial and error. Rodriguez Monegal con- siders the Chaco to be the threshold, an error (82). So, Quiroga spends almost all his inheritance, around 7,000 pesos, to buy 600 acres of land to plant cotton. The encounter with the Selva, the seeing, almost immediately made Quiroga want to own, to touch, and once he does own, he proceeds to exploit the land as well as the natives, to burn and to cut, like the other settlers in Argentina's tropical frontier. Jennifer French sees a similar triad, this time formed by land, labor, and capital, where "[l]and itself becomes the basis of the action and interaction of his characters in the colonial jungle" (54). In other words, by wanting to establish himself on the frontier, Quiroga was willing to play the role of the colonizer or the conquista- dor; little does it matter if he succeeded or failed in this attempt. His relationship with the natives sheds light on his relationship with the environment, for if the natives are not only a product of the environ- ment, but also at times the environment itself, just like the fauna and the flora, Quiroga's resentment toward them could easily be likened to his conflicts with nature, in this case the Argentine frontier: "Estos indios son de lo más vil, ladrones y sin palabra que hay, y me hallo muy dispuesto a vengarme de todas las que me han hecho"</page><page sequence="6">40 ISLE [These Indians are of the vilest kind, they are thieves and liars, and I'm quite ready to get back at them for everything they've done to me] (Rodriguez Monegal 86). Since the natives know nothing about numbers, Quiroga decides to steal from them each time they weigh the cotton that they have harvested. He tries it several times and succeeds, but this makes him feel so guilty and so angry that he soon quits these dishonest schemes. In the same way, it could very well be that Quiroga's initial inten- tion as a businessman was to bleed the Argentine Chaco and, here again, because of moral issues, he finds himself unable to do so. A year later, the whole enterprise has failed. Quiroga returns to Buenos Aires in 1905, having lost his inheritance. Rodriguez Monegal sees in the Chaco experience a dialectical relationship between the colonizer and the colonized. The Indians are the exploited ones. The colonist determines the price of cotton, and then cheats the Indians before turning around and calling them liars and thieves. But all this is fiction, in Rodriguez Monegal's opinion, for the Indians have no choice but passive resistance that Quiroga qualifies as laziness. Quiroga, however, never does become the colo- nist by virtue of his rebellious nature and radical anarchism (87). In fact, Quiroga's failed financial enterprises in the jungle kept him from joining the ranks of the dirty-smelling men with dirty machetes who followed the first man, the one who was simply eager to see, to touch, and to cut. Because of a guilty conscience, because of a sense of honesty, or of rebellion, of refusing to emulate the other colonists or exploiters, or perhaps just because of bad luck, conquering the frontier proved to be quite a difficult task. This time around the land won and Quiroga lost, so the relationship with nature evolves and intensifies, a relation- ship that will be as ambivalent as Anaconda's relationship with man: "Quiroga ama y conoce la naturaleza como por un desafío hecho contra sí mismo y no por un descubrimineto placentero o místico" [Quiroga knows and loves nature as a challenge, not because he finds in it pleasure of mysticism] (Jitrik 102). If Quiroga was attracted to the jungle, it was not because he saw in it an Eden or a paradise lost; he is neither sentimental nor roman- tic. Rodriguez Monegal even points out that he avoided the colorful niceties such as the fauna, the flora, the waterfalls, and even the ruins (80). In his stories set in the jungle, Quiroga does not allude to the beauty of the place; this is not a reification of nature. However, in Quiroga's stories, nature is not only a backdrop; it is an entity, a catalyst, a protagonist. The tropical forest is el ambiente , a formidable challenge, at times a death wish. This is Quiroga's elusive place.</page><page sequence="7">Yuyos Are Not Weeds 41 Finally, it is the Selva (el ambiente, the jungle, the environment) that provides Quiroga with the means to construct a dialectical represen- tation of nature. In spite of his failed attempt at becoming an aristocratic planter and his returning to Buenos Aires, Quiroga is not altogether through with the Chaco. Time and time again, he returns there whenever he gets a chance, to see. In a letter dated February 6, 1908, Quiroga describes the jungle as something that has been nailed perpendicu- larly into his skull and regrets how what was once his property has changed, how the yuyo- a weed- has invaded what was once a tabula rasa (Rodriguez Monegal 88). What he regrets, in fact, is the Horacio Quiroga who lived in the Chaco. Rodriguez Monegal believes that Quiroga encountered in the jungle the possibility to begin from scratch and also to experience and observe his actions and reactions in a hostile environment: "En la soledad del Chaco, en un mundo que podía pensar como salido de su mano, Quiroga debió creerse Diós" [In the solitude of the Chaco, in a world that he could consider to be his creation, perhaps Quiroga thought he was God.] (Rodriguez Monegal 89). It is in 1906 that Quiroga returns to the province of Misiones, this time around in hopes of making a fortune cultivating yerba mate. Fearful that the frontier will be taken over by Brazilian squatters, the Argentine government is forever facilitating and encouraging colonization. Already with the Land Act of 1903, the Argentine government hoped that the formation of new settlements in Misiones would help to guard the important inter- national frontier zone from possible repetition of a wave of invaders with less peaceful motives than those who had swept westward from Brazil a few years earlier, as well as from the dangers of increased contra- band in a region so difficult to police. (Eidt 96) That Quiroga's 1906 business venture fails is beside the point; what matters are Quiroga's descriptions of the tropical forest. Rodriguez Monegal writes that he is seeing and describing the green core of America. What Quiroga sees is nothing but Selva, with no clearing, north, south, east, and west, all the way north to the Amazon, all the way east to the Atlantic, all the way west to the mountains, all the way south to Corrientes. Rodriguez Monegal writes that this is the compact and primitive world that tempts him and attracts Quiroga (120). Again, this reflects Buell's third dimension of place-connectedness:</page><page sequence="8">42 ISLE A basic, sometimes fatal error made by discoverers and explorers of old as well as by tourists today is to fanta- size that a pristine-looking landscape seen for the first time is so in fact- as if it hadn't been changing for eons before they set eyes on it, certainly from natural causes and probably anthropogenic ones as well [. . .]. ( Writing for an Endangered World 67-68) So, the Selva does not remain stable, and neither do people. Quiroga, for example, was born in Uruguay, lived in Argentina, traveled to Paris, traveled to Misiones, lived in the Argentine Chaco, returned to Misiones, then returned to the city where he will continue thinking and rethinking the Selva. Buell's fourth dimension of place- connect- edness has to do precisely with all the places that have been signifi- cant to a person, "like a coral reef or set of tree rings" (69). Back in the city of Buenos Aires, Quiroga is determined to return to Misiones once and for all; but the return to the Selva keeps being put off until his marriage to Ana Maria Cirés on December 30, 1909. Rodriguez Monegal affirms that Quiroga hoped to find in Ana Maria a companion for life in the Selva, his most ardent dream (135). Early in 1910 the couple sets out for San Ignacio eager to build a life there. San Ignacio is not in the jungle; Quiroga describes it as a cluster of huts, some houses, a few stores, and a bar (Jitrik 25). Quiroga's dwelling stands between the Upper Paraná River and the town, on what Jitrik describes as inhospitable tableland with a mag- nificent view. The living conditions are rough in their small wooden bungalow: the roof leaks, and they spend their nights shifting the bed from one room to the other. Rodriguez Monegal believes that Quiroga wishes to prove himself once and for all against nature, "que no premia ni perdona, la naturaleza que él necesita pero que será (como para Vigny) madre implacable" [that neither rewards nor pardons, nature that he needs but that will be (as for Vigny) an implacable mother] (136). Rodriguez Monegal adds that Quiroga "[s]e hunde en la selva, la posee y la fecunda, para que de esa mon- struosa unión nazca (renazca) el verdadero Horacio Quiroga" [[s]inks into the jungle, possesses it and fecundates it, so that from that mon- strous union the real Horacio Quiroga may be born, or reborn] (137). William Rueckert points out that in Margaret Atwood's ecological novel Surfacing , there is a relationship between the ways in which men treat and destroy women and the ways they treat and destroy nature (117). I am alluding to this because in many ways it is reminis- cent of Quiroga's relationship with his wife and family at this particu- lar moment, and subsequently could point to his relationship with</page><page sequence="9">Yuyos Are Not Weeds 43 nature. Because childbirth was something natural, Quiroga insisted on Ana Maria giving birth to their first child in their bungalow, in the wild, with no modern amenities, and on serving as midwife himself. The result is that Ana Maria suffered terribly and would never fully recover from the trauma. Even if, the following year, Quiroga finally allowed her to go to Buenos Aires to give birth to their second child in a hospital with the help of doctors, his relationship with his wife and children continued to be as exacting as the relationship he main- tained with the natural world around him. From the moment they were able to walk, Quiroga insisted in taking his children to the jungle: Los arrimaba al peligro para que, a im tiempo, tuviesen consciência de él y aprendieran a no temerle. [. . .] Eran, en efecto, experiencias inauditas, como la de dejarlos largo tiempo solos en una espesura del bosque, o la de sentarlos en el borde de los acantilados con las piernas balanceándose sobre el abismo [He took them to the edge of danger so that eventually they would become conscious of it and learn not to fear it. [. . .] These were incredible experiences, such as leaving them alone in the depths of the forest for greats lengths of time or having them sit at the edge of a cliff with their feet hanging over the abyss]. (Jitrik 126) Likewise, Quiroga is obsessed with rendering his place in the Selva habitable. This means working the land and constantly trying to improve his dwelling. To make matters all the more taxing, Quiroga insists on doing everything himself, with his hands. Not only does he struggle with the climate, the heat, and the unfertile land, but also, as Rodriguez Monegal points out, with the people around him and with his own physical limitations (140). Initially, Quiroga came to see, but now he wants a better view of the river, and to do so he needs to transform the mesa on which his house stands, and also to cut, to clear the jungle: Para penetrar en ella, para irla domesticando de a poco, Quiroga abre picadas que mantiene viables a fuerza de machete. Es una lucha diaria con la naturaleza que no da tregua [In order to make inroads into the jungle, to tame it little by little, Quiroga wields a machete and makes clearings. It is a daily struggle with nature that gives no respite]. (Rodriguez Monegal 140-41)</page><page sequence="10">44 ISLE The daily struggle with nature makes Quiroga all the more deter- mined to struggle with the environment and makes it succumb to his will. He turns a deaf ear to his wife's protests and insists on living a primitive life; little does it matter if civilization is a few miles away in the town of Posadas or in Corrientes. Rodriguez Monegal points out that the demands he made on his wife were tyrannical and incompre- hensible to anyone who did not share his fantasies of life in the wild (156). This is how Quiroga manages his family, his dwelling, his house, and then the world around him, the ecosystem, the large house. For the eco in ecosystem, economy, and ecology comes from the Greek oikos, house. In the house, in this case a bungalow, Ana Maria spends her days weeping and complaining because she cannot acclimate to life in the wild. The couple has violent arguments. Ana Maria attempts suicide several times and finally succeeds in December 1915. Rodriguez Monegal believes that Ana Maria went mad in the jungle and also that Quiroga felt responsible for her feeling so desperate that death seemed to be the only salvation (168). Eventually, Ana Maria's absence renders life in Misiones unbear- able, and less than a year later, Quiroga returns to live in Buenos Aires: "Abandona el paraíso tan penosamente levantado con sus manos, se refugia en el caos (ajeno, monstruoso, indifference) de la gran ciudad del Sur. Vuelve" [He abandons the paradise that he so laboriously built with his own hands, and takes refuge in the alien, monstrous and indifferent chaos of Buenos Aires. He returns] (Rodriguez Monegal 171). This remains the fourth dimension of place-connectedness. For the next 10 years, he returned to Misiones regularly, only for brief stays, for in spite of it having been the scene of so much grief, it remains, according to Rodriguez Monegal, a point of reference for Quiroga's creativity and also a stimulus for his narrative work (183). In 1925, Quiroga attempted once again to live in Misiones, only to fail again. The years spent in the city, thinking and rethinking the Selva, were Quiroga's most productive. In 1918, under Kipling's influence, he published Cuentos de la selva para niños , a collection of stories he had written for his children in which jungle animals speak, think, and feel much like humans and are given anthropomorphic attri- butes. Rodriguez Monegal analyses Kipling's influence on Quiroga and points out that, for Kipling, the jungle was a literary theme and not a personal experience. For Quiroga, on the contrary, the Selva was his natural environment (186). Rodriguez Monegal adds that Quiroga was not a displaced person or an exile in the Selva; quite to the contrary. This touches upon the fifth dimension of</page><page sequence="11">Yuyos Are Not Weeds 45 place-connectedness: from the moment Quiroga first sets foot in Misiones, he is home, this is his habitat, he knows that this is where he will put down roots (11). Three years after the publication of Cuentos de la selva para niños , Quiroga is still exploring the possibility of seeing the Selva through the animals' perspectives and also of speaking on behalf of all the disempowered- not only the animals- so he publishes Anaconda . Rodriguez Monegal considers some of the stories in this collection to be a much more elaborate collection of jungle stories for children. The story that gives the collection its name, for example, describes the struggle between all the serpents of the region and the men from the Instituto de Seroterapia Ofídica. All the snakes are the residents of a laboratory where their venom is being studied. It was to stories such as these, where animals are allowed to articulate speech, that Jorge Luis Borges was alluding when he told Rodriguez Monegal that Quiroga wrote the stories that Kipling had already written better. Rodriguez Monegal recalls how dismayed he was to hear Borges' judgment, a judgment that he considered unfair (222). But it could very well be that Rodriguez Monegal misunderstood Borges, for Borges did not necess- arily say that Kipling's stories were good, only that they were better than Quiroga's. Perhaps what Borges was questioning was not so much Quiroga's talent, but rather the genre of animal stories themselves. In Buell's opinion, with the imagined miseries of beasts "Anna Sewall's Black Beauty becomes the so-called Uncle Tom's Cabin of the horse" (229). With El regreso de Anaconda , Quiroga attempts once again to see the Selva through the boa's perspective and thus to expose riverine environmental problems caused by humans. " El regreso " constitutes the first part of the collection entitled Los desterrados , the second part being made up of seven stories all set in the Misiones Selva. Quiroga's most productive years come to their apex precisely with the publication in 1926 of Los desterrados. He has not yet returned to the Selva- and will not do so until 1932- to live the last chapter of his life. According to the critic Arturo Sergio Visca, the Quiroga who returns to Misiones on Jaunuary 10, 1932, is not the same Quiroga who first went there in 1903, or the one who returned there in 1904 and again in 1910. Visca believes that this time around, the return to the Selva is an escape of sorts (9-10). The first months of life in the jungle are idyllic according to Rodriguez Monegal. It is not long before the natural environment takes Quiroga back into its fold, as if he were returning home. There is an incident with an enormous snake that Quiroga kills with a machete. Rodriguez Monegal believes that the city man died at the very moment that he wielded the machete and chopped off the</page><page sequence="12">46 ISLE snake's head. Quiroga is home, and once again, he sets out to merge the world around him. He chops wood, he hangs his collection of anaconda skins on the walls, and he cultivates his garden. The idyllic existence, however, is short lived, for in a May 10, 1936, letter to his friend Asdrúbal Delgado, Quiroga confides that he is determined to divorce Maria Elena, his second wife, since she cannot tolerate life in the jungle and he, in turn, will not return to the city (Visca 49). In a May 21, 1936, letter to Ezequiel Martínez Estrada, Quiroga expresses the extreme attachment he has to his habitat in the Selva by writing, "He de morir regando mis plantas, y plantando el mismo día de morir. No hago más que integrarme en la naturaleza, con sus leyes y armonías oscurísimas aún para nosotros, pero exis- tentes" [I should die watering my plants, and I should be planting the day I die. I do nothing more than become part of nature with its laws and harmonies that remain obscure for us, but nonetheless existent] (Visca 103). It is obvious that his relationship with nature has evolved through the years. The Quiroga who tries to cheat the natives and to make a fortune farming, the Quiroga who kills vipers and collects ana- conda skins, who incessantly returns to the jungle in search of creative energy, is also the Quiroga who once attempted to see the tropical jungle through Anaconda's eyes and who, toward the end of his life, wishes to become one with nature. This final return to the jungle was indeed an escape of sorts, an escape from the city, but also, according to Visca, a re-encounter with himself and with nature: Reencuentra la naturaleza que, en verdad, nunca había abandonado del todo, pero a la cual ahora va a amar en su última y más profunda y pura desnudez, sin preten- der forzarla para que le dé temas literarios [He encoun- ters nature all over again, but then again, he had never left it altogether, except that now he is going to love it in its ultimate and most profound and pure being, without wanting to extract from it ideas for stories]. (Visca 11) The battles with the land have been fought; some have been won, others have been lost, the stories have all been written, and coming to its end is the life of a man who carved the Argentine tropical frontier into the South American literature. As a conclusion, I would like to approach El regreso with some questions in mind, questions put forth by Cheryll Glotfelty, such as how nature is represented in this story, what role the physical setting plays, what values are expressed, and whether or not these values are consistent with ecological wisdom.</page><page sequence="13">Yuyos Are Not Weeds 47 Perhaps these questions will supply some answers as to why Quiroga belongs in the ecocritical canon without, however, having to be labeled an environmentalist saint. Visca writes that Quiroga no vió sólo en la naturaleza un objeto de con- templación, sino también una fuerza fraternalmente enemiga- admítase la paradoja- con cual era necesario luchar para subyugarla. Esa lucha es, para el salteño, un puente tendido entre la intimidad del espíritu y la intimidad de la naturaleza [Quiroga not only saw in nature an object of contemplation, but also a fraternally inimical force- in spite of the paradox- that needed to be contended with and ultimately subjugated. The struggle itself is, for Quiroga, a bridge between the inti- macy of his spirit and the intimacy of nature]. (3) The juxtaposition of the words fraternalmente and enemiga (fraternally and inimical) are reminiscent of the "sombría fraternidad" that unites the monkey, the serpent, the crocodile, the bird, the rat and the anaconda at the beginning of El regreso. What precipitates this somber fraternity is the drought. It has not rained in the jungle for months; even the morning dew has disappeared, and the "ambiente" is rapidly drying up. Three factors come into play with this drought: logging, farming, and bad luck. Since two of those three factors point to man, Anaconda and the other animals will hope for better luck- a rainfall- while they struggle against the effects of logging and farming in the area. The common enemy, man, brings the animals together in a somber fraternity. They hold a meeting. Anaconda prompts the animals as well as the spirit of the place to action: "Todos somos iguales, pero juntos. Cada uno de noso- tros, de por si, no vale gran cosa. Aliados somos toda la zona tropical. ¡Lancémosla contra el hombre, hermanos! ¡El todo lo destruye! ¡Nada hay que no corte y ensucie! ¡Echemos por el río nuestra zona entera!" [We are are equal, so long as we are united. Each one of us alone is not worth much! United we are the entire tropical zone. Let us set out against man. Man destroys everything! There is nothing that he will not cut and soil! Let us throw our entire zone into the river!]. (50) Doing so, Anaconda hopes to blockade the river and take it back. In the heart of the story, nature is man's enemy, perhaps even a formidable enemy, at least for a short while. Eventually, it starts to</page><page sequence="14">48 ISLE rain and the river floods. Once again, the deluge rages against mankind; it is the answer to a prayer from nature. Satisfied, Anaconda allows herself to be carried by the waters of the Paranahyba River for days, until she comes across a shack floating adrift and a fatally wounded laborer in the shack. As soon as the ser- pents become aware of the wounded man, they decide to kill him because he is an enemy of the jungle. Immediately, Anaconda orders the serpents to move back: "He tomado a ese hombre enfermo bajo mi protección. ¡Cuidado con la que se acerque!" [I have taken this man under my protection. I dare any one of you to approach!] (54). Although unsure as to why she has decided to protect this man, her enemy, Anaconda is adamant that she will kill any animal who dares to approach. Initially the wounded man could have been a symbolic result of the tropics' agreeing to unite against the intruder; however, soon enough Anaconda's uncanny decision to protect the man points to a certain ambivalence. Anaconda herself is aware of her ambivalent feelings and stops to question them, only to convince herself that this man is not worth the thought because he is about to die. Her unwillingness to delve into this matter will, obviously, lead her to her untimely death. Before she is shot and killed by other men, she lays her eggs next to the dead man's body. Jennifer French argues that by adopting the perspective of the boa, "Quiroga explores a relationship with the environment outside the assumptions underpinning capitalism's exploitation of natural resources" (66). The silenced voices are speaking; the silenced minds are thinking. French never questions this decision to make the boa speak and think like a human and takes it for granted that Quiroga is simply trying to overcome anthropocentrism. He very well could be; indeed, Christopher Manes sounds convincing enough when he writes that "Nature is silent in our culture (and in literate societies generally) in the sense that the status of being a speaking subject is jealously guarded as an exclusively human prerogative" (15). By simulation Quiroga could very well be treating the ecosystem as a silenced subject and allowing it to speak. Nonetheless, the boa and all the other animals are speaking and thinking in man's language, in this case Spanish. Not only are they being ascribed human attributes, but human feelings and values as well. The logger does not care about the river, but the boa does. The boa even cares about one dying laborer. Then again, perhaps, there is no other way, no way to know the animal's language and perspective, whatever that word may mean to a boa. So Quiroga worked with what he had, his emotions, his values, and his language, in order to bring awareness to the fragility of the natural world.</page><page sequence="15">Yuyos Are Not Weeds 49 Quite similar to El regreso is Barbara Gowdy's novel The White Bone that Buell judges as "a bold attempt to imagine how elephants think and feel" (232). Soon Buell comes to the conclusion that the "result is a far less reader-friendly text than Bambi or Babar or The Year of the Whale " (233). So now that the question of how nature is represented has lead to an aporia, perhaps it is wiser to analyze how nature is not represented in El regreso . For one, El regreso is not a pastoral. It does not fall under any of the definitions of pastoral that Terry Gifford proposes. El regreso is neither a classical pastoral nor a romantic one, nor does it contrast the city with the country, or even idealize nature. Without man, Quiroga suggests that the jungle would not necessarily be a harmo- nious machine, for the animals are in fierce competition against each other; they are enduring a drought- simply bad luck- and they find balance and fraternity uniting against the common enemy, man. This suggests that were man to be eliminated, perhaps the animals would go back to the way it was, each one fending for survival of the species. El regreso does not fall into the category of wilderness native either. Much like the pastoral, the wilderness narrative is at the very beginning of the triad: to see, to touch, and to cut. Both the pastoral and the wilderness construction have much to do with seeing. The nature that Quiroga is representing is quite a distance away from Thoreau's and Muir's ideas of sublime nature. Never does Quiroga attempt to describe a sublime landscape untainted by man. On the contrary, this is the jungle, closer to the bog than to the mountaintop, and man is always present. In this sense Quiroga steers clear of the trouble with wilderness, this trouble being, as Greg Garrard suggests, that nature is only pure and authentic if man is absent from it (70). Greg Garrard adds that "[a] further problem is apparent: the ideal wilderness space is wholly pure by virtue of its independence from humans, but the ideal wilderness narrative posits a human subject whose most authentic existence is located precisely there" (70-71). Nearly a century ago, when the historical perspectives of ecocriticism were not yet defined, before the time of political orientations, before deep ecology, casual environmentalism, and ecological hysteria, Quiroga was exploring possible answers and solutions to the ques- tions and the issues. He sensed that literature had a role to play, and, by virtue of living there, he was privy to the political and economical dimension of this matter. For environmental problems do, indeed, require analysis in scien- tific terms, but also personal and artistic ones. By making the animals speak, Quiroga was exploring ways to give nature some</page><page sequence="16">50 ISLE independence without assuming righteous moral positions, and without being sentimental or romantic. What he couldn't avoid, however, was using man's language and man's perspective. But he is well aware of this. After all, not only does Anaconda choose against the other animals to protect one dying laborer, but she also lays her eggs next to his body. Without providing specific solutions, this serves several functions. First of all, it points to the political and economical dimension, the presence of man, who will not be eliminated, and also to the different types of men, the laborer, the logger, the pioneer, the man in search of a dwelling- in other words, those who are there to touch, to cut, dirty-smelling with their dirty machetes, and who will not be made to leave. For it is too late, the jungle has been discovered, in this particular case, the Argentine tropical frontier. Quiroga expected to die in the jungle, watering his plants, being one with nature. His life was that of a man obsessed with a place, a place that happened to be the subtropical jungle. By virtue of this obsessive relationship with the Selva alone, Quiroga merits an earth- centered approach. But eventually all of Quiroga's stories set in the jungle should be included in any historical inquiry of literary works having to do with man's attitude toward the natural world. Regardless of whether Quiroga's stories have a moral green or pol- itical agenda, they also deserve consideration in modern-day attempts to study the relationship between literature and ecology. The reason for this is that by virtue of their contents and of their artistic merit, these stories bring the awareness to place, in this case the South American tropical jungle before it resembled a square fragment of rain forest left standing on land cleared for pasture. Quiroga expected to die in Misiones watering his plants, but he did not. Misiones remains, however, the place where he rehearsed his death over and over again in his letters and his stories. On the Sunday he arrived in Buenos Aires and asked his nine-year-old daughter for a kiss, before kissing him she told him she never wanted to return to Misiones (Rodriguez Monegal 282). So the magic place where he became a colossal tropical plant had become his daughter's own unloved place. A few months later, Quiroga died in Buenos Aires. A medical report would say that he did not die of natural causes. Notes 1. Unless otherwise noted, all the translations from the Spanish are mine. 2.
