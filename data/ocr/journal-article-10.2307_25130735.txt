<plain_text><page sequence="1">African Archaeological Review, Vol. 19, No. 1, March 2002 (? 2002) Book Review Cambridge Monographs in African Archaeology 30-40 Cambridge Monographs in African Archaeology Numbers 7-25 were re viewed in this journal in 1988 (Vol. 6). Since then another 26 volumes have been published as part of the British Archaeological Reports International Series. It is a tremendous achievement for which the publishers, now Archaeopress (PO Box 920, Oxford OX2 7YH), the distributor, Hadrian Books Ltd. (122 Banbury Road, Oxford 0X2 7BP), and especially the series editor, Dr John Alexander, are very much to be congratulated. Included in this review, which will be concluded in the next edition of this journal, are 16 of the most recent titles, some titles being out of print and the most recent not having been sent for review. Out of print titles may be obtained directly from the publisher by special arrangement. The titles not reviewed here are as follows: 26: Bower and Lubell, Prehistoric Cultures and En vironments in the Late Quaternary of Africa; 27: El Mahi, Zooarchaeology in the Middle Nile Valley; 28: Radimilahy, L'Ancienne M?tallurgie du Fer ? Madagas car; 29: Canev?, El Geili?The History of a Middle Nile Environment, 7000 B.C. A.D. 1500; 33: Holmes, The Predynastic Lithic Industries of Upper Egypt; 35: Abdel-Magid, Plant Domestication in the Middle Nile Valley; 36: Edwards, Archaeology and Settlement in Upper Nubia in the 1st Millennium A.D.; 38: Edwards, The Archaeology of the Meroitic State; 39: Insoll, Islam, Archaeology and History; and 51 : Casey, The Kintampo Complex. These monographs provide a major service to African studies by allowing authors greater length and a larger format than most journals (including the African Archaeological Review) are able to accommodate, as well as by giving some newly qualified students their first published voice. The willingness to publish in French is particularly welcome. The series' strength is also one of its weaknesses. Since the first African Monograph was published in 1980, 51 volumes, averaging over 200 pages apiece, have now been published. Few if any libraries will possess, and few researchers will wish to read, the entire lot. It is my purpose to review briefly those monographs in the series published since 1987 which remain in print, primarily in terms of their content, in order to alert potential readers to the titles that may be of most interest. 61 0263-0338/02/0300-0061/0 ? 2002 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">62 Book Review Although some monograph authors make good use of the less stringent con straints imposed by the publishing format to present well-chosen evidence sup porting new information and interpretations, others do little more than pad out a research paper of moderate length with seemingly endless pages of reviews of published literature, inflated bibliographies, and overlarge charts and illustrations, using entire pages to convey information that might otherwise have occupied a few lines of text. Comments on the desirability of a much heavier hand being used in the editing were made in the previous review of this series. These comments still apply, not least because making more efficient use of the published pages would help keep the prices down; the volumes are not inexpensive. Many of the monographs which, for lack of strenuous editing, make the heav iest demands on the reader's patience are students' dissertations printed verbatim or after only minor revision. In these cases, it is a pity that their instructors or supervisors have failed to make clear to them the very different requirements of a seminar or discussion paper, in which the student is challenged to demonstrate how much he or she has read about whatever is pertinent or peripheral to a cho sen topic, and of a published report of primary research. It seems wrong to this reviewer that research-based dissertations should be accepted for higher degrees when the material is presented in ways that do not meet the usual standards of peer-reviewed archaeological publication. Several of the monographs in this se ries could have been slimmed down to make very acceptable articles for this or other journals. It is regrettable, when scarce research funds and opportunities are invested in recovering interesting and useful data, simply to reinter them in ex cessive verbiage. Some authors might also take note that minor inaccuracies such as imperfect correlations of tabulated data, figures and plates with inadequate or incorrect captions or scales, language errors, etc. cast a small shadow of doubt on the accuracy of work so reported. Finally, in a number of the monographs it is not made clear whether uncredited line drawings and photographs are the author's own work. Except where the reviewer's tolerance is too sorely tried, these criticisms are not repeated in detail for each monograph to which they apply. Despite their limitations, potential readers should not be deterred from reading these reports. The gold outweighs the dross. 30. The Ethnoarchaeology of the Zaghwa of Darfur (Sudan). Settlement and Transience. By N. Tobert. BAR S445 (ISBN 0 86054 574 1), 1988, 268 pp. Working and living with potters in 1982, and returning in 1984 to study archi tecture, settlement patterns, and "social factors governing residency," the author's stated aim was to relate social behavior to spatial organization. Her observations range widely: potting, blacksmithing, building technology, and women's lifecycles were recorded. Craftworkers in pottery, leather, and iron were noted to be en dogamous and to comprise the lowest of three social classes. Blacksmiths were</page><page sequence="3">Book Review 63 sedentary farmers for much of the year but migratory craft workers in the dry season. Similarly, rather than transport finished wares, potters established tem porary camps near clay sources in areas where they hoped to find a market. It was noted that in Darfur much of the population used pots made by women of ethnic groups other than their own. Descriptions of house-building techniques and settlement patterns are complemented by descriptions of the decay and dis persal of the remains of abandoned homes. The diary of repeated inspections of an abandoned transient potters' camp, given in Appendix 3, is particularly interesting. 31. Shellfish in Prehistoric Diet, Elands Bay, S.W. Cape Coast, South Africa. ByW.F. Buchanan. BAR S455 (ISBN 0 86054 584 9), 1988, 257 pp. The author, in a certain sense, imitates the prehistoric inhabitants of Elands Bay about whom he writes. Between 4400 and 300 bp they collected shellfish and amassed greater and lesser deposits of shells, plus a few animal bones; he has culled, from wide-ranging sources, voluminous data on shellfish ecology, the potentials of various shellfish in terms of meeting human food needs, and resource availability, and has related these to aspects of Elands Bay archaeological sites. Much of the information is contained in 120 pages of tables and appendices, not all of which will be of interest to every reader. It is shown that there were three phases of local shellfish exploitation, most probably related to changes in the environment and the emergent coastline. These were characterized by changes in the frequencies of shellfish species exploited. Perhaps the most interesting part of the work is an all too brief discussion in Chapter 10 of the evidence, or lack thereof, for seasonal exploitation of coastal resources. Stewart's Monograph 34, reviewed below, addresses similar concerns with respect to freshwater fishing in Eastern Africa. 32. Houlouf I: Arch?ologie des Soci?t?s Protohistoriques du Nord-Cameroun. By A. Holl. BAR S456 (ISBN 0 86054 586 5), 1988, 338 pp. This well-presented report on the fourteenth-eighteenth century site was a pleasure to read. Excavations at Houlouf are part of a larger project concerned with seeking new information on processes of tell formation and the structure of do mestic spaces in the Chad basin. Five fieldwork seasons resulted in the recognition of three habitation levels in 2.6-m depth of deposit. A particularly interesting plan of the top level is somewhat marred by the lack of a key to its numbered symbols, although these are explained in the text. The 101 square meters of excavations at this level encompassed areas plausibly interpreted as representing domestic occupation, a domestic altar with three an thropomorphic ceramic heads, areas devoted to salt production and to forging, and</page><page sequence="4">64 Book Review an area of inhumations. Level 2 had a more intensive area of salt production with associated ceramic jars, some with anthropomorphic faces. Although the lowest level yielded much sparser archaeological remains, these did include a child's skull and an iron bracelet found adjacent to a furnace. Unfortunately, artifacts are presented by tabulations of samples too small to be statistically significant, with no indication of the association of particular items within separate burials or other contexts. Dimensions of lithic, iron, and brass/bronze artifacts, beads, and ceramics are given in the appendices, but a few more illustrations of the nonceramic materials would have been welcome. The ceramic materials included 326 zoomorphs, anthropomorphs, and indeterminate figures recovered from all three levels. Detailed dating evidence is not presented. 34. Fishing Sites of North and East Africa in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene: Environmental Change and Human Adaptation. By K. M. Stewart. BAR S521 (ISBN 0 86054 662 4), 1989, 273 pp. This is a comprehensive survey of northern and eastern African evidence of freshwater fish harvesting in the terminal Pleistocene and Holocene periods. Rele vant information on climate, ecology, and related matters is usefully summarized, and the fish represented at Lake Turkana and Ishango archaeological sites are de scribed. The author notes that a significant feature of traditional (ethnographic) accounts of fish procurement is its potential archaeological invisibility; most fish ing implements, nets, baskets, weirs, etc. being constructed entirely of perishable materials. Occasional sentences without verbs, or otherwise incomplete, and the occa sional use of undefined, nonstandard terms or coined words are an annoyance. The author speaks of laying out "beach quadrats" (p. 79). According to the Oxford English Dictionary, a quadrat is either "an instrument formerly used for measuring altitudes or distances," or "a small block of metal... used by printers," neither of which can have been her intended meaning. Elsewhere she says, "bone scatter fre quency or density (BSF);... is calculated as the number of bone elements collected divided by the area (m2) from which they were collected (BSF = Nb/m2)" (p. 80), and "there is a distinction in BSF and SPF between PS1 and PS2 and ASI. The BSF is much higher in the AS site..." (p. 98). Such pretentiousness contributes nothing to clear and succinct communication, which is a pity as this is in fact an interesting and useful paper. Especially interesting are the chapters on fish procurement and processing strategies at Lake Turkana sites and at Ishango 11 and Ishango 14. In Chapter 14, it is concluded that changes in fish exploitation patterns corresponded to envi ronmental fluctuations. Previous chapters provided the data, by way of analysis of fish remains, to support this assertion and, especially in Chapter 10, give addi tional information on most probable strategies offish procurement and processing.</page><page sequence="5">Book Review 65 These show a clear distinction between earlier and later assemblages; conditions in the later Pleistocene and early Holocene permitting the transfer to a wet envi ronment of what was in effect a land-based hunting technique; the opportunistic spear-fishing of large, relatively slow-moving individual fish. By mid-Holocene times, with changed patterns of resource availability, fishing had become a more specialized activity resulting in larger catches of a greater variety of smaller fish. 37. Prehistoric Settlement and Subsistence in the Kaduna Valley, Nigeria. By K. D. Aiyedun and T. Shaw. BAR S541 (ISBN 0 86054 684 5), 1989,433 pp. The surveys and excavations reported here were undertaken in the mid-1970s by Thurstan Shaw in the area immediately south of Zungeru on the Kadama River in Central Nigeria, interim reports having been published in 1976,1977, and 1978. Circumstances prevented completion of research work in the area at that time but, in 1983-1985, Kolawole Aiyedun was able to return to the area to conduct excavations of two occupation mounds and to outline a cultural sequence spanning a period from about the fourth to the nineteenth centuries AD. Ceramics were recovered from all levels, evidence of iron use from the later deposits. Heftiest of the monographs reviewed here, it is to be questioned whether the reader gets good value for money with this volume, as 232 of these pages are occupied by overlarge charts, tables, and illustrations that might have been considerably reduced with no loss of information. Neither illustrations of just two or three simple potsherds nor graphs displaying less than a dozen pieces of information ought to require the same space as a full page of text. 40. State Formation in Egypt: Chronology and Society. By T. A. H. Wilkinson. BAR S651 (ISBN 0 86054 838 4), 1996, 256 pp. This report is less all-embracing, more specific, and more useful than its broad title might suggest. It is in fact a new seriation analysis of ceramic wares and mortuary data from seven late-fourth millennium BC Nile Valley cemeteries: Tura, Tarkan Hill, Matmar, Mostagedda, Mahasna, Armant, and Hierakonopolis Fort. Research was focused on the specific aims of obtaining a refined chronology of the late Predynastic to early Dynastic transition and of investigating evidence of socioeconomic changes within that period as reflected in burial practices. Although only readers with a particular interest in the subject are likely to appreciate the comprehensive appendices of typological lists and charts that occupy almost half of the total work, it must be said that the volume is mercifully free of irrelevant material. What the author has to say is germane to his thesis and does not waste publication space. A concise discussion of the processes and chronology of Predynastic state formation and proposed parallel chronologies for cultural and political sequences spanning the period from about 4000 to 3000 BC are set out,</page><page sequence="6">66 Book Review with the period of state formation allocated to the end of the Predynastic period, about 3200-3050 BC. A new seriation of ceramic wares from the chosen sites and an analysis of additional factors reflecting the wealth, status, and elaboration of individual burials are presented. It is concluded that, during the Naqada II period, the five Predynastic sites studied shared a common trend: "increasing authority, as reflected in increasing mortuary elaboration_During the Predynastic to early Dynastic transition, the uniform socioeconomic development of the preceding phase breaks down, to be replaced by local patterns of development based upon local combinations of factors" (pp. 89-90).
