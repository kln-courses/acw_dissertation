The accessibility of Vidler's writing lies in the constitutive parameters that define this project. First, Vidier shatters the myth that contributes to preserve architecture as an autonomous and self-enclosed cultural domain; developments in architectural practice are thus conceived alongside their conceptual analogues in the fields of literature, philosophy, psychology, critical theory, and, by implication, other artistic practices. Second, Vidler's interdiscipli- nary framework allows him to substitute a materialist perspective for an abstract or prescriptive method. Thus, unlike the conventional approach, which misconstrues architecture's logic as the trans- historical essence of the discipline, Vidier explores the conceptual lines of force that have given rise to both the construction of this logic and the mapping of its fluctuations and effects. In The Architec- tural Uncanny Vidier envisions such conceptual lines of force as firmly embedded in the materiality of the body. Whether as explicit standard or structuring absence, the body repeatedly appears as index or echo of a certain psychic inscription; whatever the shifts in architectural movements or tendencies, the body figures here not as the point of origin of aesthetic production, but as unstable, yet material force traversing the human psyche and the architectural object alike. Haunted by a kind of inferiority complex vis-à-vis other more "spiritual" arts, traditional architecture has strived to make the</page><page sequence="2">1 78 Discourse 15.3 notions of use and function the pillars of its conceptualization and practice - a fetishistic orientation that allows architecture to dis- avow its supposed inability to articulate the "innermost" contents of the human soul. Vidler's analysis discloses and challenges this fetishizing tendency of architecture, notably by arguing that its empirical orientation is invariably offset by the massive intrusion of uncanny aims and effects which always exceed the concerns of a supposedly transparent, function-absorbed practice. In Vidler's proj- ect, the uncanny operates as a broad category whose productivity and efficacy, however reinforced and revalorized by Freud's writings, nevertheless surpass the psychic specificity assigned to it by psycho- analysis. As applied to architectural form, the uncanny presides over a wide variety of representations of estrangement and encompasses a broad cultural and historical expanse, from the feeling of unease first identified in late-eighteenth-century anxiety-ridden practices of the Romantics, to the equally anxiety-ridden yet free-floating archi- tectural and spatial signs of postmodernity. In the attempts to approximate a useful definition of the uncanny, Vidier shows how the term may enjoy such wide applicabil- ity while still remaining free from essen tialist connotations: "The uncanny," Vidier writes, "is not a property of the space itself nor can it be provoked by any particular spatial conformation . . . while evidently not essentially uncanny in themselves, nevertheless [cer- tain buildings and spaces] have been seen as emblematic of the uncanny, as the cultural signs of estrangement for particular periods" (11). In defining the uncanny negatively, and thus retain- ing the ambiguity of the term, Vidier speaks not so much to the absence of a conceptual core in the term as to the need to preserve the distinctiveness of its manifestations within different cultural and historical horizons. Moreover, the uncanny emerges as a category of pure indeterminacy, produced by the intractable and unmasterable slippage between that which is familiar and reassuring and that which should have remained secret and hidden, yet has come to light. Following Freud and Daniel Sanders, Vidier points out the disturbing affiliations between the two terms - heimlich and unheimlich - constituting the one as a direct outgrowth of the other: "From home, to private, to privy ... to secret and thereby magic . . . was an all- too-easy slippage" (24). Vidier divides his book into three sections - "Houses," "Bod- ies," "Spaces" - each of which provides a particular context for the exploration of the notion of the unhomely in architecture. In the opening section, "Houses," the articulation of the uncanny is still dependent on a certain humanist orientation. Despite its estranging effects, the house still defines the degree of its unhomeliness in contradistinction to the human search for security and affirmation; the reliance on a secure and protective habitat is - in each of the</page><page sequence="3">Spring 1 993 179 essays that compose this section - thwarted by a number of topoi that acquire mythical status through their various cultural inscrip- tions, reworkings, interactions, and effects. In "Unhomely Houses," for instance, Vidier makes use of the romantic topos of the haunted house to determine the specificity of the signifying field of the uncanny. Thus he traces both the affinities and the disparities between the uncanny and the romantic sublime. "Buried Alive" explores the uncanny implications of nineteenth-century archaeo- logical interests. The unhomely domesticity of the ruins of Pompeii challenges the reliability of historical fact in two crucial ways: first, it brings about an unsettling merging of past and present, and second, it confirms the existence of a "dark side" of classicism in its unabashed insistence on erotic display and its celebrations of the fragmented body. Vidier also notes the analogy between excavations of antique sites, which so fascinated Freud, and the uncovering procedures of psychoanalysis itself. The final essay in this section, "Nostalgia," meditates on the paradox that haunts the search for a fixed abode - a paradox that rests on the theoretical alignment of the house with the irretrievably lost object postulated by psychoanal- ysis. Whether seen in the context of modernist attempts to produce the "healthy and beautiful" house, free of death and memory, or from the postmodernist perspective that substitutes image for sub- stance, the Heideggerian notion of dwelling is invariably pro- blematized - either reduced to a modernist version of nostalgia for a never-experienced space, or destabilized by referring to the surface imprint of an absent past. The reader interested in gaining a brief but substantial view on the conceptual fluctuations that have affected the place of the humanist subject in architecture should turn to the middle section of the book. Its opening essay, "Architecture Dismembered," fleshes out the underlying concern in all of Vidler's insightful analyses - a consistent conceptualization of the architectural object by reference to a diversely localized and heterogeneously assembled body. The historical tracing of the bodily analogy in its architectural inscription signals a deanthropomorphizing progression that also informs the visual economies in the history of painting, as well as the areas of literature and criticism. Thus in the classical theory of architecture, the body/building analogy serves to advance the claims of authority, confirmation, and stability that characterize the transcendental, Cartesian subject. In a second stage, beginning in the eighteenth century, architecture reacts against the supposedly "natural" prem- ises of classical organicism. Once seen as a standard of judgment, the body is now placed in the service of subject perception. The super- session of subjective states of body and mind fractures the unity of body and building, substituting the category of projection for a naive belief in immanence. A third moment is defined by the extension of</page><page sequence="4">1 80 Discourse 15.3 the body beyond its sovereign limits - a biomorphism that is "no longer confined to the recognizably human but embrace [s] all biological existence from the embryonic to the monstrous" (70). In "Homes for Cyborgs," for example, the interstices between the organic and the inorganic are characterized as a fertile ground for the emergence of uncanny sensations: in the cyborgian house, the merging of the human and the machine constructs an optical scene in which subjects are included as part of a system of virtual signs, a spatial scene reduced to the flat surface of a monitor. In discussing the moment of architecture beginning in the 1960s, Vidier points out the change undergone in the relation between the architect and his/her work. The projects of Coop Himmelblau, for example, inscribe the body language of the designer onto the map of the city, thus instantiating the author's celebration of the will to lose power over the object, as well as over the social body scrutinizing his work. By revealing the effects of a common ideological substrate on all significant shifts in the various artistic and cultural practices, Vidler's characterization of the pres- ent state of authorial inscription further confirms the validity of his eclectic approach. In a later essay entitled "Trick/Track," the archi- tectural design itself comes to embody this crossdisciplinary perspec- tive: Bernard Tschumi's park of La Villette in Paris is described as a (para) architectural work of intertextual "notation," where codes from literature, philosophy, film, and music are made visible for scrutiny and inspection. Although Vidler's project seems to focus with particular atten- tion on the work of contemporary architects (Bernard Tschumi, Rem Koolhaas, Peter Eisenman, Coop Himmelblau, John Hejduk, Elizabeth Diller, and Ricardo Scofidio), some of his essays intimate that fundamental features of a typically deconstructivist perspective are already present in works that date from earlier epochs. Particu- larly striking for its seemingly anachronistic conception is Louis Boullée's Temple of Death, an eighteenth-century design which antic- ipates the contemporary invalidation of a transparent and positivist architecture. Along similar lines, modernist buildings such as James Sterling's project for the Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart, espouse the idea of a faceless architecture whose implications are no less disruptive of anthropomorphic analogies and expectations. In any case, the contemporary scene already advanced in these earlier works points to a consistent denial of the thrust of historical force, and a refusal of architecture to lend itself to familiar meanings and uses, insisting instead on its own right to question its significance as well as that of the subject it implies or addresses. While providing irrefutable evidence that the category of the uncanny is not a whimsical invention of postmodernity, Vidler's analyses at the same time figure a major shift in the ways present</page><page sequence="5">Spring 1 993 1 81 projects and designs incorporate and embody this phenomenon. No longer emerging as the signified repressed by the binding rules and functions that formerly contained the architectural object, today's uncanny explodes as a free-floating non-meaning that has come to inhabit the object/signifier itself. Whether suggesting psychical lack or ideological shelterlessness, today's designs may become literal representations of psychoanalytic and/ or poststructuralist notions. The lack that structures the human psyche, in other words, shows its face - or rather, non-face - in the desolate spaces and artefacts that increasingly derealize the space of the city. The building or the architectural ensemble is no longer the guarantor of the subject's capacity to name and appropriate the world, but rather the image whose initial promise of destination and fulfillment reverts to unpre- dictable trajectories, surfaces of obdurate repetition, dispersal, and opacity. One can only hope, with Vidier, that the tangible and materially embedded reality of architecture will counteract the kind of self-grat- ifying formalism which, by merely expatiating on the psychological side of the unhomely, ignores or trivializes the issue of real homeless- ness in our cities. Fortunately, Vidier argues, the political cannot be so easily eliminated from cultural practice; rather, following the paradoxical logic of the uncanny, social and political concerns seem to reerupt in spite of the efforts mobilized to repress their voice. Thus it is with a mix of irony and relief that Vidier remarks: "The ghost of avant-garde politics ... is proving difficult to exorcise entirely" (14).</page></plain_text>
