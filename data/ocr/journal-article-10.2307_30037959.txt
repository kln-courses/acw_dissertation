<plain_text><page sequence="1">NINE FRAGMENTS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR: POETIC LINES ATTRIBUTED TO TERPANDER Abstract: An examination of the nine fragments attributed to Terpander (some in ancient sources, some by modern editors) suggests that none is securely assigned to him. Indeed, the evidence suggests that most circulated in citharodic prooimia, and that the attribution to Terpander was a metonymic process of identification of a genre with its traditional founder. This interpretation makes better sense both of the fragments themselves and of the uses to which they were put in our source-texts. There is a tension in modern scholarship on Terpander between a widespread ambivalence concerning the fragments attributed to him, and the more general belief that he might be in some sense a historical figure. It has been argued that there was no Helle- nistic edition of Terpander's poetry,1 and that of the nine fragments ascribed at various times to him, there is not one whose ascription is assured. Indeed, authorities as eminent as Denys Page and Martin West argue against any of the attributions being correct.2 At the same time, an abiding belief that Terpander "does belong to history, how- ever misty, rather than mere legend" persists.3 In this article, I argue against the usefulness of the rigid modern separation between his- tory and "mere legend" in the case of Archaic Greek poetry, but I begin by suggesting that in this case life and work should perhaps be read in similar ways. As noted above, West is skeptical about all attributions to Ter- pander. When discussing fr. 3 below,4 he argues with characteristic dryness that the attribution "hardly means more than that it was a 1Livrea (1993) 6. As I argue below, the nature of the fragments we have under his name, as well as the ways they are reported to us, contribute to this sense that there was no Hellenistic edition of Terpander. 2 See PMG 362; West (1982) 56. For a more positive view of the status of the frag- ments, see Gostoli (1990), whose text I use. Significant recent work on the subject in- cludes Negri (1992) (pace Negri, I do not consider the attribution of Pindar fr. 325); Livrea (1993). Mathiesen (1990) has useful observations on Terpander from the per- spective of the history of music, and tends to accept our sources' accounts of his role in that history.

BEECROFT traditional invocation used by citharodes."5 As we shall see, this obser- vation is equally pertinent to virtually all the fragments ascribed to Terpander, but my argument goes further. I see no reason, given the evidence, to insist on a historical Terpander, even one whose frag- ments can be assigned to a tradition of citharody. Instead, I argue that Terpander the man, like Terpander's poetic "corpus," is best understood as a convenient metonym, a biographical incarnation of a diachronically-evolving tradition. The debt this argument owes to oral-traditional poetics will be obvious,6 but my intent is not to pros- elytize. In other words, I am not using oral-traditional poetics as an ideological given, but as a hermeneutic model. I will not claim as such that Terpander did not exist, or that the citharodic tradition did not originate in the work of one or a small number of individual poets. Rather, my argument is that the evidence transmitted from the an- cient world concerning Terpander and his work is most useful when read as a source for the later construction of a history and theory of citharody. Elsewhere, I will examine the biographical anecdotes as- sociated with Terpander's name and argue that those anecdotes are best understood as devised to discuss the origins, production, circu- lation and value of citharodic poetry.7 Here, I concentrate on the nine fragments attributed to Terpander, and attempt to show that recog- nizing his association with them as a biographical metonym for the citharodic tradition itself not only resolves (or dissolves) a number of problems, but provides greater insight into how and why they exist in the first place. The fragments may fail in their search for an author, but our understanding of them only gains from this loss. Before moving to the discussion of individual fragments, I must briefly address the question of "history" and Terpander's place in it. The pseudo-Plutarchean De musica cites Heracleides Ponticus as giv- ing Terpander an important role in the history of citharody, but, just as important, as including him in a genealogy of citharodic poets, which reads, in sequence: Amphion, Thamyris, Demodocus of Cor- cyra, Phemius of Ithaca, Terpander and Stesichorus (Ps.-Plu. Mus. 1131f6-2c6 = fr. 157 Wehrli = T 28 Gostoli). That our source speaks of "historical" and mythico-literary figures in the same way, as having an equal degree of historicity, should come as no surprise, but should also give us pause in any effort to draw a clear line between the realms. My point is not new; T.W. Allen was similarly cautious in distin- guishing the historicity of Homer from that of classical poets, though s West (1982) 56. 6 As will the more specific debt to the scholarship of Gregory Nagy; see Nagy (1999) vii s1 n. 1 for "Homer" as a metonym for Homeric epic. 7 Beecroft (forthcoming).</page><page sequence="3">NINE FRAGMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO TERPANDER 227 his intentions were opposite to mine.8 But the implications of the an- cient equation of Amphion, Demodocus, Terpander and Stesichorus are not always recognized. Given that (as I argue in a forthcoming book) all the anecdotes about Terpander's life have a generic quality, and indeed are for the most part also associated with other poets within and beyond the citharodic tradition, and given that (as I will show below, and as others have argued) all the fragments attributed to him have a similarly generic quality and seem in our sources to be assigned to him in his capacity as the incarnation of citharody, it is not clear what is gained by assuming that Terpander was a historical figure in a way that, say, Demodocus was not. I would argue that all the figures in this genealogy9 are "virtual poets," figures either in- vented or (more often) appropriated by later tradition to provide chronological depth to citharody as a synchronic phenomenon. If these poets did not exist, in other words, they would have had to be invented. In what follows, I examine each fragment attributed to Terpan- der, in the order in which Gostoli presents them, briefly examining the evidence concerning authorship before exploring the fragment's implications for my larger thesis. A number of points will recur at frequent intervals. Many of the sources either do not directly link Terpander's name with the fragment they cite, or do so indirectly, informing us that the words are attributed to Terpander, rather than that they are by Terpander. For many fragments, there are alternative attributions in our sources, or the sources emphasize the generic quality of the fragment rather than its author. Finally, most of the fragments are directly or indirectly identified as prooimia, or as some other form of introductory component of a longer work, and the sources suggest that such openings were common to a genre, rather than specific to an author or a composition. At the close of the article, I return to my claim that the association of these fragments (by both 8 Allen (1924) 12: "It is the modern world which has set a gulf the other side of Archilochus or Terpander beyond which human beings are not found and all we de- scry is Gods in the making, bloody rites and commercial movements that have come down to us under a false anthropomorphic and individualistic guise." Allen claims that Homer should be treated as a historical individual by seeking to fill in the gulf between Archilochus and Terpander on the one hand, and Homer on the other; I be- lieve that the evidence more plausibly suggests that we should be no more credulous of ancient claims about, say, Terpander than of ancient claims about Homer. In any event, we should resist the temptation to draw a firm line between myth and history, when our sources do not do so. 9 With the exception of Stesichorus, enough of whose work does survive to allow us to say something about it, and more of whose poetry was most likely extant and edited, at least in Hellenistic times. Even here, our understanding is limited by our tendency to rely on a modern notion of historicity when reading what survives of Stesichorus' poetry and the biographical accounts concerning him.</page><page sequence="4">228 ALEXANDER J.

XXXV 27371 I 19-20 = Ar. fr. 590.19-20 = SLG 6 This fragment exhibits a number of the features mentioned above. The phrase is not unique to Terpander, as it also forms part of the opening line of h.Hom. 21. The source of the attribution to Terpander, a papyrus fragment of a commentary on Aristophanes (in which the phrase appears as a lemma),11 seems to claim that Aristarchus attrib- uted the phrase to Terpander, while Euphronius attributed it to Ion of Chios. A third source, unnamed, attributed it to Alcman (SLG 2), and the papyrus also notes the phrase's appearance at h.Hom. 21.1.12 The multiple attributions offered suggest that the phrase was in fact found in works associated with all three authors, and that the debate (if any) concerned which author used it first (a question that largely depends in turn on which of them lived first). With this in mind, I believe that the most important question to ask about this fragment involves its function. An important clue in this regard is provided by h.Hom. 21, which is just five lines long and clearly functioned as a prooimion to a longer work (West, tr.): 10 I use West's translation of the phrase as it occurs in h.Hom. 21.1. See also Gostoli (1996) 126, who discusses the use of orrr6 as a preposition or a verbal prefix indicating musical accompaniment of a voice. The swan of the Homeric Hymns passage is unlike- ly to be using his wings as a musical accompaniment, since he is landing on a river bank! The lack of even a possible context for this phrase in Terpander's work makes it impossible to render judgment. Pace Livrea (1993) 4-6, who finds in the 6th-c. CE Pam- prepius of Panopolis evidence that fr. 2 preceded fr. 1 in an original composition by Terpander, I would argue that h.Hom. 21 offers more persuasive evidence on this point, even if one assumes (as I do not) that frs. 1 and 2 are part of the same composition. 11 The play from which this fragment is drawn remains unidentified: Lobel, in edit- ing the papyrus, does not assign it to a specific play, and is followed in this respect by Kassel-Austin, while Austin in CGFP 56, following Luppe (1973), assigns it to the Ana- gyrus. More to the point for my argument, the absence of any context for this Aristo- phanic quotation greatly impedes our interpretation of the phrase's original function. 12 See Lobel's commentary on the papyrus (P.Oxy. XXXV 43) for an elucidation of the grammatical and textual ambiguities in this passage. I follow his interpretation.</page><page sequence="5">NINE FRAGMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO TERPANDER 229 1olPE ~GE PE-V Kal KiKVOS iTro 1TTEpJyCOV My' E68EI1 6xO, iTnTt6pCg 1TOTaploV Tipa btVTiEVTa lrlvet6v- oi 6' 6otb6 sXC.Ov q6potpyya XiyEtav lVEE1Tfi5 Trp(c)T6v TE Kal UOTaToV aiEv QEi16E.

Phoebus, of you the swan too sings in clear tone from its wings as it alights on the bank beside the eddying river Peneios; and of you the bard with his clear-toned lyre and sweet verse ever sings in first place and last. So I salute you, lord, and seek your favor with my singing. Gostoli, in making the case that this fragment belongs to Terpander, acknowledges its presence in the Homeric Hymns, but suggests that it may be of formulaic or proverbial origin, and thus common to several authors.13 Gostoli argues that the phrase "matches the rhythmical structure of a hemiepes," and would thus have been well-suited to use in diverse metrical contexts. While this is true, it is striking that the phrase, in the only surviving complete line in which it is found, does not fill out a hemiepes, but straddles the midline caesura. Whatever it is, it cannot simply be a formulaic half-line readily inserted into a variety of poetic forms; for that matter, the fact that it is unintelligible on its own is a reminder that, if it indeed appeared in recognizably the same context in four distinct works, there must have been more to it than the three words we have. With this in mind, I suggest that the relevant formulaic unit is larger than the three words of our frag- ment, and that a larger unit, equivalent to h.Hom. 21 in content if not in every word, may have been a conventional prooimion, assigned to one poet or another depending on which relative dating scheme, and which theory of the origin of the prooimion, a given ancient scholar preferred. If Terpander is only a metonym for a tradition, the ancient debate about the locus classicus for this phrase becomes intelligible as a debate among competing narratives concerning who, when, where and how the prooimion came into being. fr. 2 Gostoli: Ap avaX6' EKaTTIf36OOV EtBIETW (ppiTV Again for me of the far-shooting lord let my phrin sing Sources: Suda a 1700, 1701; ZERRsAr.

BEECROFT In the case of this fragment, we have no alternative attributions; our four closely-linked sources agree in attributing the phrase to Terpan- der (although sources 2 and 4 must be emended to show the attribu- tion).14 More striking is the emphasis each source places on the gene- ric quality of the phrase:15 the Suda's references are to glosses on the verb amphianaktizein, which are explained respectively as "to write in the nomos Orthios" and "to compose a prooimion," while the scholia on Clouds use, respectively, the verb amphianaktizein and the noun am- phianaktes to describe the composition and composer of a prooimion. One version of the scholion goes as far as to describe this prooimion as typical of both citharody and dithyramb (IERs). Further, the terse Suda a 1701 is the only source not to refer specifically to comic parody of the phrase; the scholia to Aristophanes explain that aspect of the use of the phrase in Clouds, while the first Suda reference cites its appear- ance in other fragments of Aristophanes (fr. 62) and Cratinus (fr. 72), in addition to citing its use in the tragedian Ion (TrGF 19 F 53c). The phrase as quoted above is the maximum offered by any source (Suda a 1700); indeed, Suda a 1701 and the R-scholion quote only from am- phi to anakta, while the scholia to manuscripts E and Rs quote only the first line. Although none of these sources is likely to provide exten- sive verse quotations, it is noteworthy that for the most part what they provide is confirmation that a phrase parodied in comedy is conven- tionally associated with citharodic prooimia and therefore metonymi- cally with Terpander. The sources are thus primarily interested in making claims about the generic character of the phrase amphi moi autis anakta..., whether citharodic or dithyrambic, not in discussing Terpander as such, and indeed their references to Terpander suggest that the association of the phrase with him comes primarily from his role as notional inventor of the form. Page would seem to share this assessment; he rejects all the fragments attributed to Terpander, al- lowing for some doubt in the case of this one and the one that fol- lows, but ruling against their authenticity as well.16 14 Both present strikingly similar errors, if that is what they are: Suda a 1701 reads Periandros for Terpandros, while the R-scholion to Aristophanes reads Periandrou for Ter- pandrou, suggesting that both garble a common source. 15 See e.g. the opening of h.Hom. 19; E.

That Page adopts Hermann's emendation and re-classifies the fragment metrically are telling points. He does not reject the fragment as a later invention (as he does with fr. 3, be- low); instead, his note suggests that it is authentic, but inappropriately attributed. Page does not suggest an alternative attribution, and Gostoli may be right to retain the connection to Spartan citharody, even if there is no reason to assign individual authorship.</page><page sequence="7">NINE FRAGMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO TERPANDER 231 fr. 3 Gostoli: ZEO TTadVTcov pX6aT, "''VTCov ayilT&amp;rop, ZEO, o00 TTITCO Ta"rTaV aIvvcov dapX6v Zeus, beginning of all things, director of all things, Zeus, I send you this beginning of hymns.

Therefore, the harmony of the bar- barian [i.e., for Clement, Hebrew] psalterion, which reveals the holiness of the melody, and which is most ancient, became a pattern for Terpander in par- ticular in hymning Zeus in the Dorian harmonia thus: (fr. 3 follows). This passage suggests that Terpander composed in the Dorian har- monia using the enharmonic genos, a statement that becomes prob- lematic for many scholars when combined with another statement attributed to Aristoxenus (fr. 84 Wehrli), preserved in the pseudo- Plutarchean De musica, which claims that the enharmonic genos was first applied to the Dorian scale in the time of Olympus, i.e. after Ter- pander. Weil and Reinach, in their commentary on Pseudo-Plutarch, suggest that the text of Clement of Alexandria is corrupt,"8 while Gos- toli argues that the connection between the enharmonic genos and the Dorian harmonia should be read as separate from the statement about Terpander.19 Wehrli suggests that the use of the enharmonic genos is backdated to Terpander to provide it with a more noble an- cestry.20 Gibson argues that Aristoxenus is in fact claiming that the development of the enharmonic genos began with Olympus' omission of the lichanos, but that it only took final form later.2 West does not 17 PMG 698.

BEECROFT address this controversy directly, but his dates for Terpander and Olympus offer considerable room for overlap.22This is a moment where understanding Terpander as a metonym for the citharodic tra- dition proves helpful. If we accept that, for Clement, as for his sources, Terpander was the citharodic tradition, and that an attribution to Ter- pander means nothing more than that the fragment was part of that tradition, the problem of dating becomes moot.23 The simultaneous claims that Terpander's authorship is genuine and that Aristoxenus is correct about the enharmonic genos can only be reconciled at the expense of considerable ingenuity. If, on the other hand, we accept that the fragment is a traditional prooimion, conventionally and con- veniently assigned to Terpander, the need for reconciliation disap- pears, as do the problems of chronology. fr. 4 Gostoli: aol &amp;' IjiETS TETpayapuv o(TiocyTp(aVTES Oli~d~ ErTTaTOTr6vcp 6pplyyt vEOUS KEXaCGBOOPEV 1UpVOUS Rejecting the four-voiced song, we shall sing for you new hymns with a seven-toned phorminx (lyre).

Cleonides attributes 22 West (1992) 329-31. 23 A similar argument could be made concerning the claim about Olympus. 24 This reinforces my contention that no Alexandrian edition of Terpander existed. 25 Wilamowitz (1903) 64 n. 1. West (1981) 116, raises the possibility that the pas- sage may be "a literary-historical forgery." I incline to the alternative view put forward by West, that it may be a legitimate part of the citharodic tradition, even if there is no reason to credit the specific attribution to Terpander.</page><page sequence="9">NINE FRAGMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO TERPANDER 233 the fragment explicitly to Terpander, although in a context that makes it clear that his sole interest lies in demonstrating the use of heptatonos as a term equivalent to phorminx; Anatolius similarly quotes the passage as a literary ornament to his catalogue of objects that come in sevens. This account of Terpander's role in the development of the seven-stringed phorminx presents difficulties. As Aign points out, seven-stringed lyres are attested in the archeological record as far back as Mycenean and Minoan times.26 The account of the inven- tion of the four-stringed lyre by Hermes, found e.g. in Boethius (De musica 1.20), is at odds with h.Merc. 51, which explicitly states that Hermes uses a seven-stringed lyre. Gostoli, while conceding these points, argues along with Deubner that the iconographic evidence shows the prevalence of four-stringed lyres before the second qcuarter of the 7t century BCE and of the seven-stringed lyre thereafter. Since this corresponds to the era in which she places Terpander, it follows for her that, if Terpander cannot himself be the inventor of the hep- tachord lyre, he is at least its popularizer in the Greek world. I propose an alternative reading. Given the problems associated with Terpander's dates,28 the iconographic evidence brought forward by Deubner and Gostoli is of doubtful value. We are left with evid- ence that suggests the antiquity of the instrument itself, if not of ar- tistic representations of it. We are also left with multiple accounts of the invention of the four-stringed version of the instrument, by Her- mes and by the mortals Amphion, Orpheus and Linus (all Plin. Nat. 7.204), as well as with various accounts of the further refinement of the instrument by others, including Terpander.29 The ancient sources take none of these versions more seriously than the others, and nei- ther, I suggest, should we. What we have is a typical narrative, spun out in different ways by different authors. The function of this narra- tive is more significant than its content, which varies widely. The nar- rative serves to explain how musical developments associated with the East reached Greece,30 while resolving the anxiety surrounding 26 Aign (1963) 44. 27 Gostoli (1990) XXXIX-XLI. Mathiesen (1999) 243-4 is non-committal, dating the seven-string lyre to "at least as early as the time of Terpander." 28 See my forthcoming book on the divergent and contradictory ancient evidence concerning Terpander's dates. 29 Note in particular the Boethius passage, in which specific individuals are iden- tified as having added the fifth (Coroebus, son of Atys, king of Lydia), sixth (Hyagnis), and seventh (Terpander) strings to the lyre. This version is particularly striking, in that it attributes the addition of each new string, respectively, to a Lydian, a Phrygian and a Lesbian who worked in the Doric world. The elegance of this pattern seems pro- grammatic rather than historical. 30 For the claim that Hyagnis developed the aulos and was responsible for import- ing it from Phrygia to the Greek world, see e.g. Ap. Fl. 3; Nonn. D. 41.372-6; AP 9.266 (= Antip. Thess. CVIII HE); Ath. 14.624b-c.</page><page sequence="10">234 ALEXANDER J. BEECROFT how the Spartans, understood in the post-Archaic period as cultural arch-conservatives, could earlier have had so innovatory a role in the development of Greek song-culture.31 The representation of Terpan- der must accordingly express both contradictory attitudes. He must be represented as from Lesbos, must fulfill the role of a culture-hero in bringing the seven-stringed lyre and citharodic poetry to Sparta- but must also be represented as punished by the Spartans for his in- novation, by having his superfluous lyre-strings cut off. The account of Terpander's death choking on fruit at the Carneian choral compe- titions he himself established is likely a further reflection of this ten- sion.32 Whatever the historical realities surrounding the emergence of citharodic poetry in Sparta, what we know of Terpander is best understood as a retrospective mythologizing of the situation, as the personification of a process. Whoever Terpander may or may not have been in life, in the textual tradition he embodies the acquisition of Eastern musical knowledge and practices by the Spartans, and in this role he can be replaced in whole or in part by other figures. fr. 5 Gostoli: EvO' aiXpla TE VEicV O6dXEl Kcai MCOa oiyEtLa Kail iKa e puv yuta, KaX&amp;)v ETrTToppo6oS Epycv Here flourish the spear-point of youths and the clear-voiced Muse, and broad-wayed Dike, defender of good deeds.

Inst. Lac. 238c (= T 50 Gostoli) for the story that the ephors fined Ter- pander and nailed up his cithara because he added an extra string to it. That this is another generic anecdote is shown by the fact that Plutarch offers a similar story about Timotheus in the same paragraph. See also Plu. Ap. Lac. 220c and De Prof. Virt. 84a for a similar anecdote, this time involving Phrynis. Ath. 14.636e-f reports a longer version of the Timotheus-variant, in which the poet defends his supernumerary strings by pointing to a statue of Apollo, whose instrument bears the same number of strings Timotheus is condemned for using! West (1992) 330 argues that the claim that Terpan- der invented the seven-string lyre simply reflects his status as the "first famous ci- tharode to be remembered," although West also believes that Terpander may well have been the first citharode to popularize the seven-string lyre. 32 See e.g. Suda y 315 (= T 16b Gostoli) for this story.</page><page sequence="11">NINE FRAGMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO TERPANDER 235 Here the counsels of old men and the spear-points of youths are the best, and choruses and the Muse and Aglaia. The pronounced similarity of the fragments has made scholars suspi- cious of the authenticity of the one attributed to Terpander,33 but Gostoli argues that either Pindar is borrowing from Terpander, or both are drawing on a common Spartan tradition.34 While I share Gostoli's willingness to see in the fragment some reflection of Spartan tradition, I would go one step further and combine her possibilities to suggest that Pindar is making use of a Spartan tradition, which takes the name of Terpander. Rather than assume that there was at any time both an anonymous corpus of Spartan citharodic poetry and a body of poetry composed by Terpander in imitation thereof, the simpler solution is that Terpander serves as an author-function, embodying the unknown, anonymous or oral-traditional composers of the scraps of such poetry, which are all even ancient scholars seem to know. At the conclusion of his work, as he assesses the merits of the contemporary Roman emperor Hadrian, Arrian observes: cLOTE ES TfiVE T1V Trapoocav rpaoiXtiav, iUv Abptavo' EiKOOTOiV TOOT' ETOS PactoAEUEI, Tro'X0 I?

So that these lines (fr. 5 follows) seem to me to much better fit the present kingdom, which Hadrian has ruled these 20 years, than ancient Sparta... This passage is useful because it demonstrates that this fragment had currency in the age of both Arrian and Plutarch-it was evidently well enough known to be quoted and recognized, the more so in that Arrian places it in a position of importance, at the end of his work. While his rough contemporary Plutarch is happy to cite the quota- tion explicitly as from Terpander, Arrian does not, whether through doubts about the attribution, or because for his purpose the attribu- tion is irrelevant. This provides us with a useful reminder that we must pay attention to an author's purposes in quoting a fragment, which may have little to do with modern concerns.35 Both Plutarch 33 van Groningen (1955) 184.

Most's introduction to the volume edited by Burkert and the "Introductory Considerations" of Dionisotti in the Most-edited volume are particularly important contributions to the nascent theoretical discussion of the fragment. Especially useful is Bowie, in Most (1997) 53-66, who develops both a definition of the fragment (briefly,</page><page sequence="12">236 ALEXANDER J. BEECROFT and Arrian are primarily interested in this fragment for its value as a marker of the military and cultural prowess of Sparta (in Arrian's case, to flatter by comparison the emperor Hadrian), not in its value as evidence for the life and work of Terpander. Where Plutarch links the quotation to Terpander, Arrian does not, but both citations focus on the fragment's Spartan origin, not its authorship, and are consis- tent with the model of Terpander as a metonym for his tradition. fr. 6 Gostoli: TfpTrav8po5 yE fl'v 6 A'ap3toS Nraoav XyEt TETItOrlvTIKvaI TOV At6vuaov TOV VnrO6 TIVCAov Iaptiov 6voiaS6pEvov, EK At65 Kai FEpOEqp6vfTl yEV6OEVOV, ETTa VITO TCov TITtdVCO caTOapaXOEvTa. Terpander the Lesbian says that Nyssa is the nurse of Dionysus, who is called Sabazios by some, born of Zeus and Persephone, and later torn in pieces by the Titans. Source: Lyd. Mens. 4.51 Little can be said about this fragment. There is some controversy over the use of the Phrygian name Sabazios for Dionysus, which is not otherwise attested until Aristophanes (e.g. V. 9, 10; Av. 873; Lys. 388) and over the use of NCooa in place of the more usual Nx'oa for the name of the nymph said to have nursed Dionysus.36 Joannes Lydus does not, however, claim that Terpander used the name Sabazios, and the spelling of Nusa can perhaps be explained by the more than 1000 years between Lydus and the poet he claims to cite. More im- portant, Lydus' interest lies not in Terpander at all, but in variant traditions on the parentage of Dionysus; in addition to this reference to Persephone as Dionysus' mother, he includes other possibilities from ancient sources such as Ge (Earth), known according to him by the cult-name Themele.37 There is no evidence that Lydus had direct access to the text of a poem on Dionysus; at most, he may have known of a now-lost prooimion to the god. the citation of a passage from one text in another, when the author of the second does not have access to adjacent parts of the first work), and a typology of "procedures ... [which] may be judged to stand in varying degrees of proximity to the citation of the fragment, but not to constitute such a citation." (p. 53) This definition, which Bowie acknowledges is more restrictive than that generally used, provides the basis for an argument that those who quote Archaic elegists do so from complete editions of their work; by this definition, it seems unlikely that those who quote Terpander are citing from an anthology. Part c of Bowie's typology, "citation of part of an oral or literary text as a way of referring to the whole," is a category which may be relevant to Ter- pander, although it is not always easy to distinguish between this category and the fragment proper under Bowie's definition. 36 Gostoli (1990) 143-6. Page (1972) 363 perhaps reflects general opinion on the sources for this fragment and the others which follow: nolite eis credere. 37 Lyd.

Dion. a 76 (p. 102 Erbse); Hsch. a 3113; Phot. a 987 Bergk (1853) was the first to assign this fragment to Terpander; all the sources identify it as an exodion common to hoi kithar6idoi without naming a specific author.38 Gostoli classifies this fragment and the two that follow as dubia. In the case of fr. 7, her reasoning seems to be that none of our sources explicitly connect the fragment to Terpander. It is interesting that each source quotes exodia for other genres as well, and in these cases frequently cite known authors without referring to them by name. Aelius Dionysius, for example, cites II. 2.360 as a typical rhapsodic exodion, and also cites as the tragic exodion a line found in the concluding choral passages of no fewer than four Euripidean tragedies (Alc. 1159; Andr. 1284; Hel. 1688; Ba. 1388). We cannot be certain whether the Homeric and Euripidean lines are here represented as generic or as specific to their known authors, but it is clear from the context that our sources are inter- ested in the phrase all' anax in its generic role only. The fluidity with which a line from Homer can be represented as used by hoi rhaps6idoi is suggestive; if a Homeric line can be used metonymically of a genre of performers, we should not be surprised elsewhere to find an almost unknown poet represented metonymically as the author of works in a genre associated with him. fr. 8 Gostoli: rTiEV8C')pEV TaiS Mv6ioaS Taoiv Moioaatl Kal TCr) MouodpXcp AaToOS vuiEI.

Source: Analecta Grammatica 6.6 Keil = PMG 941 Like the previous fragment, this passage was first attributed to Ter- pander by Bergk, although in this case in his third edition (1867). Bergk's decision rests on the fact that this fragment, like fr. 3 above, is entirely spondaic, and such meters are connected in our sources 38 Unless we accept Bergk's emendation of a corrupt passage in Hesychius; the manuscript reading is KLapyTOUv TO, KaaCTa6ov, which Bergk emends to KLeapq)80i To KaTa Tiprrav6pov.

BEECROFT with Terpander.3" The source for these verses does not connect them to Terpander, or indeed to citharody in general, although the metri- cal and thematic parallels provide some evidence in support of this. In particular, Gostoli (who classifies the fragment among the dubia) points to the Frogs of Aristophanes, where Euripides, parodying the citharodic poetry of Aeschylus, uses the refrain ToqAaTTO6paT TO- qAarTTropaT (e.g. Ra. 1286), which she identifies as spondaic, between verses.40 This fragment, then, can only be considered legitimately Terpandrean if the (somewhat weak) evidence suggesting that it is citharodic is understood to imply Terpander as its author; if, in other words, the biographically metonymic aspect of Terpander I have been highlighting is practiced anew in modern times. The fragment has also been classified among the Carmina Popularia (49 Diehl). fr. 9 Gostoli: C ZIAIV65- Ki AiATha KaXX&amp;IOTOit CoTIPE O most handsome saviors, of Zeus and Leda (born) Source: D.H. Comp. 17.44 = PMG 1027c In this case, it is Leutsch who ascribed the passage, quoted by Dio- nysius of Halicarnassus as an example of the Molossian meter, to Terpander.41 The argument is similar to that for fr. 8, except that there is considerable doubt, both about whether this fragment is in fact Molossian,42 and about whether that meter is especially associ- 39 On spondaic meters and Terpander's association with them, see West (1982) 55-6. This is not the place to enter into a discussion of whether the spondees of this passage should be grouped to form iambs, trochees or spondees; indeed, the decision is all but impossible in the absence of information about performance practice or mu- sical notation. Gostoli (1990) 148 points out that, as Bergk moved from his second to his third and fourth editions, his interpretation of the meter changed, from doubled spondees - - to iamboi orthioi - -. This shift was accompanied by a transition from labeling the fragment as adespota but possibly by Terpander, to labeling it as definitely by Terpander. It is unclear whether Bergk's increasing certainty about the meter led to increasing certainty about the ascription, or the other way around. 40 Gostoli (1990) 149. The Aristophanic line presents almost insuperable textual and metrical complexities; we know enough to be sure that Aristophanes is parodying something citharodic in the poetry of Aeschylus, but not what it is. West (1981) 122 suggests that the tophlattothrat simply evokes the citharode's punctuation of his song with strums on the cithara. 41 Leutsch (1856) 342. 42 Briefly, Buchholz (1873) 558-67 suggests anapests; Leutsch and Schneidewin (1958-61) 342 trokhaioi simantoi; Bergk iamboi orthioi. Rossbach and Westphal (1854-65) 99-100 review the possibilities, adding doubled anapests -- - and cretics - - -. More recently, West (1982) 55-6 seems to incline to the Molossian account, while Gostoli (1990) 151 reads the meter as equivalent to two feminine hemiepes (- The very number of interpretations argues against the validity of any one.</page><page sequence="15">NINE FRAGMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO TERPANDER 239 ated with Terpander.43 That the fragment was also classified by Nauck as adespota tragic fr. 139 is a further reminder of the uncertainty of its status. No credible evidence connects the fragment to Terpander, or indeed to the citharodic tradition; the metonymic links between Molossian meter, spondaic meters, citharody and Terpander are too tenuous to bear any weight. Conclusion: Much of what I have said above is not new. West, Page and others have expressed doubts about individual fragments, and have couched their specific concerns in terms that suggest a more general skepti- cism. Many of the sources for the fragments do not name Terpander, name him as only one possible author, contest or cast doubt on his authorship or name him in a context that makes his name almost indistinguishable from a generic marker. Most of the fragments are, explicitly or implicitly, from prooimia, which by their nature can be used in multiple contexts. What I have sought to do in this article is not, then, to insist on a radical re-appraisal of these fragments, reject- ing generally-accepted claims of authorship. Rather, I wish to chal- lenge the idea that claims of authorship are at stake. At the begin- ning of this article, I suggested that it might be helpful to think of Terpander not as a historical person like Pindar and Aeschylus, but as a personification of a tradition, a metonym in human form for un- known composers of little-known poetry (little-known, the evidence suggests, to ancients as much as to moderns). Throughout, I have sought to demonstrate the value of this model, not on the ground of oral-traditional ideology, but because it provides a simpler account of the evidence. Rather than assume a historical individual responsi- ble for all, some or none of the fragments attributed to Terpander, I suggest that there existed (and to a limited extent, still exists) a body of citharodic poetry, mostly in the form of prooimia, composed over an uncertain period beginning in the Archaic era, and that ancient (but still retrospective) attempts to understand this corpus used the figure of Terpander as a convenient container for their ideas. As frs. 7-9 attest, this use of Terpander continued well into the 19th century, when scholars such as Bergk and Leutsch attributed fragments to him principally because they appeared to be citharodic, and there- fore, through the logic of metonymy, by Terpander. 43 West (1982) 56 notes that the reference to the Dioscuri suggests a Spartan con- nection, but avoids a discussion of either the attribution of the fragment or the nature of the meter.</page><page sequence="16">240 ALEXANDER J. BEECROFT If Terpander is not a man but a tradition, many of the complexi- ties surrounding these fragments disappear. The minor puzzle of why our sources characterize passages from Homer and Euripides as belonging to "rhapsodes" and to tragedy generally is resolved by accepting that, at least in certain contexts, they view the boundary between poet and genre as fluid. The contradictions inherent in the biography of Terpander, the simultaneous welcome and rejection our sources give him in Sparta, can be better explained if his biogra- phy is understood as a field in which questions about the circulation of cultural innovations were addressed. Problems of chronology are a noteworthy example. Our sources connect a variety of musical in- novations to Terpander, ranging from new strings on the lyre to new nomoi and new metrical patterns. The evidence for the development of music is frequently at odds with the attribution to Terpander, but if he is understood as a metonym for citharody, as its notional foun- der and exemplar, the collapse of the diachronic (the history of the development of citharody) into the synchronic (citharody as a phe- nomenon embodied by Terpander) makes more sense. We have lost an author (though we barely knew him), but we have gained a posi- tion from which to re-assess the work. ALEXANDER J. BEECROFT Yale University WORKS CITED Aign, Bernhard. 1963.
