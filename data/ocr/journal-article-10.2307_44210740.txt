<plain_text><page sequence="1">City Councílmen and the Church in Seventeenth Century Chile By Della M. Flusche HE CHURCH, which played an integral role in the life of colonial Spanish America, was closely tied to the political structure. This was true largely because of papal concessions to the Crown of Castile and the manner in which the ruling monarchs exercised their pre- rogatives in their overseas possessions. Although scholars have ex- amined the royal patronage (patronato real) from the standpoint of the higher echelons of colonial government and ecclesiastical authority, few studies have probed its implications on the municipal level.1 Neither have the religious aspects of the colonial mentality attracted much notice. This article will approach both subjects by focusing atten- tion on Santiago, the capital of the frontier colony of Chile, during the formative decades of the seventeenth century. An analysis of the official records of the city council, the Actas del cabildo de Santiago ,2 discloses not only the relationship between the local civil and ecclesi- astical authorities but also the religious attitudes and activities that were characteristic of the laymen who served in the cabildo. The capitulares (councilmen), acting as the spokesmen of the Span- ish aristocracy, claimed that their decisions furthered the common good which encompassed the spiritual as well as the material order. In their discussions, they drew no clear line between the two spheres and expressed a consciousness of their dependence on God, the Lord who held dominion over heaven and earth and demanded that His people demonstrate their loyalty to Him in acts of homage. Along with many of their contemporaries in the Western world these Chilean Spaniards viewed disease, earthquake, flood, and drought as afflictions visited on them for sin. The God they worshipped was, nevertheless, a merciful Lord and could be propitiated by appealing to Him. In this He bore a resemblance to the temporal monarch. God and King were the Two Majesties. Each could be approached for favors directly or indirectly, the King through his officials, God through His saints.3 The cabildo found it as natural to represent the city before the court Dr. Flusche has her degree from Loyola University, Chicago; she is an Assis- tant Professor in the Department of History at Eastern Michigan University.</page><page sequence="2">City Councilmen and the Church in 17th Century Chile 177 of heaven as before the royal audiencia (high court and administrative council), and, consequently, spent a great deal of time planning re- ligious services in conjunction with the local clergy. Among the annual religious observances which claimed cabildo attention were those held during Holy Week and those marking the feasts of favorite saints. The feast of Saint James the Apostle (Santiago, in Spanish) was of particu- lar moment, and both religious solemnity and secular entertainments singularized the day set aside to do honor to the saint who was the patron of the city and of Spain.4 When epidemics threatened the city, the council took practical pre- cautions against contagion and also arranged special religious services. A saint would be chosen as an advocate to stay the hand of God from the city. An appointed delegate would then confer with the ecclesi- astical authorities, either the bishop or the cathedral canons, to set the date and time for a public procession. The audiencia and religious orders received invitations to participate if they wished. Since candles were considered indispensable, capitulares frequently appeared on the streets begging alms to pay for them. On the occasions when the towns- men failed to contribute sufficient funds, city revenues defrayed the déficits.5 The council used simlar measures to avert the calamity of crop failure in the rural areas from which the city fathers drew much of their livelihood. Thus when a pestilence of mice attacked vineyards and grainfields in 1630 the cabildo petitioned Bishop Francisco de Salcedo to pronounce a malediction on the rodents. The capitulares expressed a plaintive regret that they had no better solution for the problem and began to plan a procession to make the action they deemed inadequate more effective. When a plague of locusts struck thirty five years later, Santiago again had recourse to prayers for deliverance from the offending creatures.6 The droughts which reduced crop yield prompted the councilmen to authorize prayers for rain to insure good harvests. A Mercedarian friar, Diego Pedraza, convinced that Our Lady of Mercy, the patroness of his monastery, had responded to the city's petitions for rain during 1636, had the "miracle" certified by the cabildo notary on August 19. The insistent Pedraza appeared before the council a second time a few days later and pleaded that Saint Raymond had surely helped in sending the miraculous shower and deserved to be honored on his feast day. The capitulares obligingly adopted San Ramón as one of the city's intercessors to be invoked during droughts. They promised to attend Mass annually on his feast and to see that shops remained</page><page sequence="3">178 Records of the American Catholic Historical Society closed until noon to lend solemnity to the occasion. The cabildo quali- fied its cooperation, however, by stipulating that common laborers would continue to work as usual throughout the day.7 This hint of secularism did not deter Pedraza from presenting still another request to the council in 1639. He had wrung an order from the Bishop, Gaspar de Villarroel, to have the feast of Saint Peter Nol- asco observed in the city by abstinence from all servile work. The bishop had excluded those who performed manual labor in rural areas from the command, and under that condition, the cabildo approved the institution of the new feast.8 The propertied interests represented in the cabildo did not object to honoring another saint provided that neither their fields nor their herds were neglected because of it. In 1647 a severe earthquake devastated a large part of Santiago and much of the surrounding territory. Manuel Toro Mazóte, the cabildo notary who chronicled the calamitous event, described it as an act of "divine justice," and reported that many lives were spared "miracu- lously" through "God's showing His infinite mercy, when because of our sins He could justly punish all of us."9 In 1648 the council inau- gurated an annual procession to prevent a repetition of the city's de- struction, but passing years dimmed the memory of the divine castigation and there was no service in 1664. News of an earthquake in the Peru- vian town of Pisco in that year graphically reminded the councilmen of their omission. They interpreted the phenomenon as a sign that their negligence had aroused God's wrath and hastened to appease "His divine Majesty" with an elaborate procession reaffirming their subjection to Him.10 Evidence, both expressed and implied in the council records, of belief in an immediate, personal, if somewhat anthropomorphic, God balances tìie incipient secularism which was also integral to the colonial Weltan- schauung. Material concerns partially explain why men manifested their faith, admitted sin, and simultaneously lacked a sensitive con- science on questions of social justice.11 Beset by threats to their physical and material well-being, the Chileans found spiritual solacé and emo- tional outlets in public religious services. On the political level, the Hapsburg indulgence of the penchant for "conspicuous display" in civic and religious ceremonies may also have been à subtle attempt to foster colonial loyalty to the crown.12 The intertwining of things spiritual and temporal which character- ized religious attitudes áhd activities also influenced the interaction between the cabildo and ecclesiastical institutions. A case in point was the council's involvement in the diocesan synod held in Santiago1 in</page><page sequence="4">City Councilmen and the Church in 17 th Century Chile 179 1688. Bishop Bernardo Carrasco y Saavedra, a Dominican friar, asked the councilmen to prepare a list of issues for the synod to study. Of the three cabildo sessions which dealt with the response to the invita- tion, that of January 23 featured a copy of the formal statement sub- mitted. Beginning the communique tactfully, the council expressed its '•unanimous" approval of Carrasco's management of affairs relating to the ecclesiastical estate. The precepts regulating the lives of the clergy and laity, the capitulares noted, were generally observed; nevertheless, the conduct of some individuals called for specific synodal legislation as a corrective measure.13 Among the topics drafted for the synod's deliberation were proposals concerning pastors of Indian parishes and financial matters relating to them. The cabildo asked for a rule forbidding the curas de indios to induce their Indian parishioners to bequeath property to them under the guise of offering Masses for the departed. Provisions for prayers and Masses, in the council's opinion, should be handled by the heirs, the executors of the will, a royal magistrate, or the individual to whom the dominion or administration of the Indian's property pertained. In an earlier discussion of the approaching synod, the cabildo had deplored the fact that curates inherited Indian property and thereby prejudiced the "natural right" of the heirs who were too "poor and miserable" to defend themselves.14 What might appear as a laudable desire to pro- tect the Indian from grasping clerics would seem, therefore, to be a maneuver to bar ecclesiastics from competing with Spanish layman for Indian property. The recommendation also testifies that some Chilean Indians acquired property, and although subject to pressure, enjoyed a degree of freedom of choice in disposing of it. The capitulares opposed not only clerical extortion of Indian prop- erty but also the collection of stole fees for officiating at Indian marri- ages, baptisms, and funerals. The curate should receive only his annual stipend and that only on condition that he visit the ranches and farms under his care at least seven times a year to investigate the morality of his charges. During these visits he was to ascertain if the Indians were receiving instructions in the faith twice a week.15 In seeking to promote the Christianization of the Indians, the cabildo shared the spirit of the crown on Indian conversion. Royal legislation enjoined priests in rural Chile to visit their native parishioners in order to administer the sacraments and to supervise their continuing religious instruction. For this work, the crown assigned curates portions of Indian tribute which obviated the usual stole fees charged in urban centers.16 The labor system whereby encomenderos (Spaniards to</page><page sequence="5">180 Records of the American Catholic Historical Society whom Indians were entrusted) collected tribute in the form of personal service17 meant that monetary payments to clergymen had to come from the encomendero himself. The controls the cabildo desired to establish on the actual payment of the stipend and the opposition to stole fees are therefore understandable. Two additional suggestions which the council presented to the synod dealt with marriage regulations. The cabildo proposed that parish priests be required to make careful investigations of marriages con- tracted by persons from other cities because some men, especially In- dians, lived "publicly with their concubines under the title and form of matrimony, in offense of God, Our Lord, with the pretext of the holy sacrament of matrimony." A second statement urged that women who were separated from their husbands by judicial decision be com- pelled to live in seclusion. This, the councilmen believed, would pre- vent scandal and might prepare the way for reconciliations between estranged couples.18 That the cabildo's recommendations for improving public morality and the spiritual life of the diocese were in line with ecclesiastical thinking on the subject is clear from an examination of the synod's resolutions.19 Specific rulings on pastoral duties commanded priests to attend to their parishioners' spiritual needs and emphasized their obligations in regard to providing religious services and instructions in Christian doctrine for the non-whites under their care.20 All pastors were instructed to keep careful records not only of the marriages but also of the baptisms, confirmations, and funerals held in their parishes. The statement on marriage records, along with a stipulation that banns of matrimony had to be published prior to a wedding ceremony,21 seconded the cabildo's desire to discourage illicit or bigamous unions. The synod had a dual objective in regard to financial matters. In an effort to require the laity to fulfill their obligation to provide support for pastors, the synod summarized and reviewed the proper sources of ecclesiastical revenue.22 To eliminate the clerical extortion which had provoked cabildo criticism, ordinances, in accordance with previous royal and ecclesiastical legislation, forbade priests under pain of mortal sin to demand payment for administering the sacraments to Indians: Neither could pastors assigned to Indian curacies in rural areas charge for burials unless interment were inside a church, in which case they could ask for an offering to be applied to the cost of supplying the church with sacred vessels and books. The synod also reiterated an earlier injunction ordering pastors to refrain from inheriting Indian property. The penalty for violation was excommunication, and pro-</page><page sequence="6">City Councilmen and the Church in 17th Century Chile 181 cedures were established to restore the property of deceased Indians to the rightful heirs.23 Although the synod would not, or could not, work any major im- provement in the status of the non-whites held in servitude, it neverthe- less took a stand on the human rights of the laboring classes. Anyone who deprived persons of their freedom to contract matrimony was threatened with excommunication. Encomenderos, estate managers, and employers of domestic servants were charged to cooperate with the clergy in providing religious services and instructions for the workers and enabling them to attend. Encomenderos and estate man- agers were not to make excessive labor demands, and rural pastors were to intervene to prevent such exploitation. Another directive urged mistresses of households to relieve their servants of working at night. Unremunerated compulsory labor by Indian or black slaves on feast days was forbidden under pain of excommunication. If they freely chose to work on holy days, wages had to be paid. In cases of grave necessity forced labor, compensated by wages, could be required upon obtaining ecclesiastical permission.24 By these legislative measures, the synod attempted to correct the abuses the Spanish laity perpetrated against the laboring classes. The oligarchy's desire to protect and advance its own financial con- dition not only militated against social justice in Chile25 but also under- lay the cabildo's consistent challenges to increases in the normal revenues assigned to the Church under the patronage system. During the episcopate of Bishop Salcedo, a diocesan synod held in 1626 decided that the stole fees, which were set by a combination of civil and ecclesi- astical law, should be raised. The King approved the proposal and enjoined the viceroy of Peru, the crown's chief official in South Amer- ica, and the archbishop of Lima, who had ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the diocese of Santiago, to work out the details of a new arancel (rate scale) . When the new schedule of fees was forwarded to Chile in 1632, it evoked immediate criticism from the cabildo. Arranging for a request to the Lima authorities to stay the enforcement of the fees and royal decree sanctioning them, the councilmen collected funds from city residents to pay an attorney for pleading the case in Peru. Resistance to the increased fees appeared again in 1638. The appeal had either delayed the imposition of the higher fees, or the capitulares had gathered their strength to initiate a new court action. The arancel was finally enforced, however, and remained in effect without sub- stantial change until at least 1850.26 Financial contests also developed over the tithe levied on agricul-</page><page sequence="7">182 Records of the American Catholic Historical Society turai and livestock production. In Chile as in all Spanish American areas, this tax was collected by farming it out to the highest bidder. The bishop and the cathedral canons then received one-half of the amount rendered by the tithe farmer. The other half was divided nine ways, with the crown receiving two-ninths, and the remaining fraction being distributed among various ecclesiastical establishments in the diocese.27 The cabildo showed no overt opposition to the normal tithe payments but registered resentment over the violation of custom in 1609 and 1692 because new items formerly exempt from it were included.28 When Bishop Diego de Humanzoro granted permission to the rural parish priests to collect primicias (first fruits) on all agricultural and livestock commodities, the cabildo again protested. The council's argu- ment, in a lawsuit before the Santiago audiencia in the 1660's, was that traditionally only portions of wheat and barley were allocated as first fruits; consequently, the bishop's inclusion of all crops and various kinds of livestock was an unlawful infringement upon long standing custom. Certain rural clerics were, furthermore, making themselves obnoxious by personally taking animals they wanted from private herds and, according to the cabildo, had to be stopped. During the dispute, the councilmen decided to report to the King on the un- warranted extension of the primicias.29 The constant factor in the cabildo's stand on ecclesiastical support was opposition to increasing clerical revenue at the expense of the laity, or, as the council viewed the issue, to the detriment of the com- mon good. Similar considerations were apparently responsible for occasional efforts to force religious establishments to help defray the cost of public works projects through the payment of tolls and imposts which the council levied.30 Although on one occasion the cabildo became embroiled in a dispute between the bishop and the superior of the Franciscan friars over the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Santa Clara nuns,31 most cabildo action concerning the religious orders of women centered on material matters. For example, an episcopal ruling which related to the financial re- sources of the convents of women met loud cabildo objections in 1649. Bishop Villarroel had decided to raise the dowries that novices pre- sented upon entering the religious life. This proved to be only a tem- porary expedient to help the convents through the difficult period following the 1647 earthquake because in 1652 the council contentedly noted the reversion to the lower customary dowry.32 The real estate religious orders acquired as well as their finances</page><page sequence="8">City Councilmen and the Church in 17 th Century Chile 183 came under the cabildo's scrutiny. One especially well-documented land grant to the Santa Clara house illustrates the steps religious orders took in obtaining property and the council's role in the process. In November, 1663, the convent's business manager petitioned the cabildo on behalf of the abbess and nuns to close a street adjoining their grounds in order to expand their buildings. The council then appointed an alcalde (magistrate and councilman) to collect testimony on the advisability of endorsing the request. After considering favorable re- sponses from various witnesses, the cabildo drafted a report urging the audiencia to approve the grant since it was not opposed to municipal interests. The court reviewed the case and authorized the cabildo to confer the land on the nuns. The council thereupon appointed two of its members to transfer title to the land to the convent.33 The involvement of both the cabildo and the audiencia in the foregoing case reveals not only the overlapping jurisdictions affecting land acqui- sition in the colony but also a willingness on the part of the local officials to expand religious holdings. While the cabildo lacked exclusive juris- diction over land grants, it could forestall them by denying the initial petition as it did in 1696 when it decided that the public thoroughfare the Santa Clara nuns were requesting needed ;to remain open.34 The capitulares' attitude toward nuns could be indulgent or strict, depend- ing upon the particular question under consideration. The control of patronage over certain religious establishments in the city provided the cabildo with further opportunities to exercise financial and economic influence. As the patron of a chapel endowed by Juan de las Cuevas, the council had charge of administering the property which supported the chaplain who in turn had to say Masses for the soul of the deceased Santiagoan. The terms of the Cuevas will also empowered the council to nominate and present candidates for the benefice to the bishop who made the canonical institution. In the several nominations for the chaplaincy during the century, the cabildo did not mention hierarchical opposition to its choices.35 The benefice apparently passed smoothly from one holder to the next without the shadow of an investiture controversy. The cabildo itself founded a chapel dedicated to Saint Anthony, an advocate invoked for protection against the seasonal fla¿h floods which struck the city. Rather than appoint a specific chaplain, the council in 1626 contracted with the Mercedarian order for a priest to say eight Masses each year and specified that one was to be offered on New Year's Day to obtain the guidance of the Holy Spirit for the annual election of councilmen. After concluding these arrangements, the</page><page sequence="9">184 Records of the American Catholic Historical Society cabildo confined its patronage to directing preparations for the pro- cessions held on the feast of Saint Anthony and soliciting alms for those ceremonies and the chapel's upkeep.36 The council, reflecting in miniature the crown's wider patronage of the Church in the Indies, conducted itself as the arm of local secular authority in its relationships with ecclesiastical institutions and the individuals who represented the institutions. Awareness of the im- portance of their faith led the capitulares to respect, at least outwardly, the hierarchy's spiritual authority. Pronouncements of excommunica- tion meant more than exclusion from active participation in the spiritual life of the Church for they also carried civil sanctions. When Bishop Juan Pérez de Espinosa used the spiritual weapon against the alcalde Alvaro de Quiroga y Losada in 1611, the council seconded the action by stating that he could neither attend sessions nor hear cases in his capacity as a magistrate. The capitulares declared that Quiroga would, furthermore, be barred from voting in the forthcoming council election and remarked that a vote cast by an excommunicated indi- vidual, in any case, would be void. They congratulated themselves for preventing "scandal" and determined that Quiroga could resume his official duties only when he presented written proof that the excom- munication had been lifted. The essentials of the pattern were repeated in 1657. The minutes for January 13 of that year stated emphatically that the alguacil mayor (chief constable and councilman), Antonio de Barambio, had been denied a vote in the session because the cathedral chapter had excommunicated him.37 By ruling that excommunication suspended the right to exercise a political office, the council upheld the civil effects of ecclesiastical pronouncements. The cabildo's registry of clerical credentials further illustrates that mutual respect existed between civil änd ecclesiastical corporations. In acknowledging the special juridical status of the clergy (the fuero) which exempted clerics from civil jurisdiction and entitled them to trials in Church courts,38 the councilmen followed a routine procedure. An individual who had received the tonsure and taken minor orders pre- sented a document (título) verifying his preparation for the clerical state, and the cabildo publicly and officially abnegated the rights of civil authority over him insofar as the royal patronage allowed. The bishop or, if the see were vacant, the provisor (a temporary adminis- trator of the diocese) issued the títulos. Some individuals who had petitioned the council for recognition as ecclesiastics had served in the cathedral or a parish church for less than one year while others had prepared in this manner for as many as six years.39</page><page sequence="10">City Councilmen and the Church in 17 th Century Chile 185 Like applicants for the ecclesiastical fuero, laymen who were appointed to official positions with the Holy Office of the Inquisition in Santiago40 also submitted títulos to the cabildo. Since this proce- dure was the primary point of contact between the two bodies, the records containing the registry of credentials are an important source of information on Inquisition personnel. The Lima inquisitors issued most of the títulos found in the seven- teenth century Actas . The first individual they appointed as a familiar (lay agent) was Bernardo González de la Mora whose brother was a judge in the Santiago audiencia, a fact suggesting collusion between the inquisitors in Peru and the civil court in Chile. Later in the cen- tury, Pedro de Acuña Suarez y Velasco moved up from the office of Inquisition notary in the small northern town of La Serena to the position of familiar in Santiago, indicating that an individual could make a career of working for the Holy Office.41 The licentiate Joseph Gonzalez Manrique, elected as a cabildo alcalde in 1681, served simultaneously in dual Inquisition offices while retaining his civil post. In his título dated June 23, 1680, which is typical of those from Lima, the inquisitors appointed him familiar and legal advisor (asesor) to the Santiago comisarios , the ecclesiastical officers of the Inquisition. After certifying the legality of his appoint- ment before the clergymen, Gonzalez Manrique presented his título to his fellow councilmen. It stated that as asesor he was to give his legal opinion on the decrees and sentences the comisarios imposed in their public and secret hearings of civil and criminal cases. The document also gave him the right to bear arms. No civil official could relieve him of his weapons under penalty of excommunication and a fine payable to the Holy Office. Under the terms of the appointment, criminal cases in which he was personally involved fell outside of the competence of the civil courts and were instead allocated to ecclesiastical tribunals. Since the título predated Gonzalez Manrique' s election as an alcalde, it is clear that the inquisitors had not intended his Inquisition appoint- ments to be a means of infiltrating council sessions. The cabildo* s acceptance of the alcalde as the familiar-asesor and the routine copy- ing of the document reveal no hint of resentment toward the privileges he received or the pluralism his election to municipal office had created.42 Two other recipients of dual appointments from the Holy Office in Lima followed the same procedure that Gonzalez Manrique did in pre- senting their credentials. In 1682 Lorenzo Vazquez de Poyancos, a resident of Santiago, was named familiar and collector of monies and</page><page sequence="11">186 Records of the American Catholic Historical Society properties due the Holy Office under the title of teniente de recetor (deputy receiver) during the absences and illnesses of his father, Sebastián Vazquez de Poyancos, the usual receiver of fines. A decade later the combined positions of familiar and Inquisition notary went to Joseph Serrano, another local resident. As clerk of the court, Serrano had the exclusive right to record proceedings before the Santiago comisarios.43 A título issued by the Santiago comisario Francisco de León shows that the Holy Office had its own police officers to implement its court orders. In 1683 when Francisco Barahona was dhief constable for the Inquisition in Santiago, he requested comisario León to appoint a deputy to assist him. León selected Lázaro de Figueroa, who registered his título with the cabildo in August of that year.44 The recording of so many Inquisition appointments during the latter part of the century suggests one of two things: either the Holy Office bureaucracy was growing or the new appointees were being more conscientious in presenting their credentials to the cabildo. In either case, the council minutes reveal no fear of the Inquisition as a sinister institution. The registration of credentials eliminated the most obvious grounds for concern, that of secret agents. What the records do reflect is differences of opinion on protocol. In 1645 and again in 1648, for instance, the cabildo expressed resentment over the inferior position assigned to it in the public processions that preceded the autos de fe of those years. The comisario, Francisco Machado de Chavez, settled the dispute to his own satisfaction in 1648, but the cabildo, unwilling to surrender on a question of precedence, appealed to the Holy Office in Lima for a more definitive answer.45 It is doubtful whether the councilmen would have carried the case to Peru if they had stood in awful dread of the tribunal. Their promptness in doing so implies that they thought of the Inquisition as just another court within the complex jurisdictional system in which they lived. The dispute over rank in public ceremonies was typical of the cabildo's usual concern for precedence. The capitulares considered it important for their personal dignity and the city's municipal honor to be accorded an appropriate role in public religious activities. Early in the century, the councilmen spent several years in a successful en- deavor to have benches installed in the cathedral for their exclusive use when attending services as a corporate group on special occasions.46 More than comfort was involved in securing these seating arrangements. The cabildo wanted God, King, clergymen, and ordinary citizens to be aware of its embodiment of the city. In a municipality on the fringe</page><page sequence="12">City Councilmen and the Church in 17th Century Chile 187 of civilization where life was as harsh and uncertain as it has ever been, the bickering about protocol was psychologically motivated not only by a desire for respect but also by a need to establish or retain identity. The councilmen had to remind themselves that they repre- sented His Majesty's "noble and loyal city" by occupying prominent places at public functions. For the same reason, conflicts between civil and ecclesiastical authorities over outwardly petty matters were treated with all seriousness and on occasion were referred to Spain for final decision by the King.47 Not all of the cabildo' s efforts to guard against clerical encroach- ment upon the real or supposed rights of townsmen involved questions of protocol and civic honor. An example is the lengthy controversy which developed between the cabildo and the local branch of the Mercedarian order over a mill that the friars owned. The canal supply- ing water to the mill drew water away from some neighborhoods and flooded others. After forty years of debate on this engineering dilemma, the councilmen and friars met in 1674 to consider the possibility of moving the mill to a new location. Despite the council's offer to donate another site, no agreement followed. A threat to have the audiencia close the mill because of the damage it caused two decades later in 1693 likewise proved ineffectual. Even after the cabildo had given the land for a new mill, the friars were continuing 'to operate the old one in 1697.48 By matching the capitularies in pertinacity, the Mercedarians had thus acquired additional land and were apparently in no hurry to undertake the expensive operation of building a new mill. The cabildo, for its part, had proved rather inept in defending the public good. In evaluating evidence of anticlericalism in the Santiago cabildo records, the nature of the records must be kept in mind. Since the primary purpose of the council meetings was problem solving the dis- cussions emphasized the strife that arose rather than the quiet coopera- tion that usually existed between the council and the Church. On occasion the services that religious establishments and individual clerics rendered, especially in the fields of education and public health, merited specific recognition49 More typically, the council worked with religious orders and ecclesiastical authorities on these and other matters in a routine fashion and accepted this as the normal state of affairs.50 The cabildo, believing that its duty was service to God and King, portrayed itself in its records as the legitímate civic agency responsible for advancing the spiritual and temporal good of the community, sub- ject to the definition of that term within a stratified, seventeenth cen-</page><page sequence="13">188 Records of the American Catholic Historical Society tury Spanish American society. Its success was relative to its time and place in history as well as to the personal and group interests which sometimes deflected it from its high purpose.
