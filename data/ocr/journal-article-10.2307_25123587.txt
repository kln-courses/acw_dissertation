David Burress ABSTRACT. In their role as political actors and lob byists, corporations have responsibilities to help deter mine the existence and content of global regulations of pollutants. The ethical nature of those responsibilities is highly sensitive to the assumed normative framework. This paper compares several frameworks by modeling them as differently weighted versions of utilitarianism. Under a strict neoclassical approach, corporations have a narrow obligation to maximize profits, which generally entails opposing emission regulations. In contrast, a stakeholder approach as well as Marxian and common ethics approaches suggest that firms have an obligation to actively support sustainable emission regulations with the following properties: major restrictions would be global rather than local global restrictions would apply in all cases of per sistent emissions global restrictions would apply to non-persistent emissions as well, unless they have been affirmatively shown to be safe using reasonably persuasive scien tific evidence safety thresholds would be set fairly restrictively, based on administrative models and rules of thumb, in light of existing scientific knowledge but without requiring full scientific justification long-run goals would include zero emission of per sistent unsafe substances. However, the stakeholder approach supports phase-in rules to mitigate short-run compliance costs.

Emission regulations are relevant to corporations when emissions are either side-effects of production and distribution by corporations and their supply and distribution chain, or side-effects of use by the ultimate customer (Uusitalo, 1996). In at least some situations, there is both a public policy case and an ethical case (e.g., Koppari, 1999) for insti tuting such regulations at a global level. At present no global authority can establish such regulations uni laterally. However, global arrangements referred to as "international regimes" (see e.g., Young, 1999) including formal regulations, are increasingly being established by means of multilateral treaties, agree ments, and intergovernmental cooperation. Major corporations (or their leaders) are impor tant political actors in the determination of national and international regulatory regimes.

The question raised here is: in the course of their public-policy-related activities, what global emission regulations, if any, are corporations ethi cally obligated to support? If either corporations as such, or their human decision-makers, are viewed as ethically obligated agents, then those obligations could potentially apply to any form of action, including action taken as a political agent influencing public policy. Indeed, given the highly significant effects of public policy on aggregate human welfare, then, at least under consequentialist theories, ethical rules should be at least as binding on political actors as they are on actors in other roles. A distinction can be drawn between responsibili ties of the corporation as an institution, and those of its leaders. Under common law for example there is a distinction between sanctioning a corporation (with costs borne by the shareholders) and sanctioning a leader (with costs borne by him or her personally). It has also been argued that only real human beings, and not fictitious corporate persons, can have intentions or be subject to the obligation of behaving ethically (for a recent debate on corporate moral agency, see Barry and McCann, 2000). In this paper I will assume for simplicity of exposition that any motives and ethical obligations at stake rest jointly on the insti tution and on its leaders; and I use the term "cor poration" to include both. For those who deny the moral agency of corporations, my arguments would still apply to their leaders taken alone. It is not universally accepted that either corpora tions or their decision-makers are subject to any ethical responsibilities other than profit-making. Stakeholder theories of the corporation do in fact imply a much broader ethical framework (Donald son and Preston, 1995; Freeman and Reed, 1983). However, the predominate competing theory ? the neoclassical theory of the corporation ? can be understood in its strictest form to imply that corporations have only a pragmatic responsibiHty to make a profit.2 In this interpretation, it is the role of private competition and public regulation, rather than the corporate conscience, to ensure that private profit seeking is socially beneficial. For critiques of both theories see Humber (2002) and citations therein. Both theories are described in more detail below. This essay compares implications of the two theories for the regulation of emissions. It also makes additional comments on the implications of Marxian ethics as well as common ethical principles. The several frameworks are compared by modeling each as a differently weighted version of utilitarianism. This embeds each framework within an economic approach to ethics, as in Little (2002). In the eco nomic approach, ethics is reduced to benefit-cost analysis ? i.e. right action is that which maximizes social benefits less social costs. While the language of benefits and costs has a different ring from other approaches to ethics, most benefit-cost theorists do view benefit-cost analysis as a branch of applied ethics ? for the reason that it leads to normative conditions for action based on the good for society as a whole, rather than the good for anyone individual. Using that framework, I will argue that strictly neoclassical corporations ethically cannot support global regulatory regimes. Rather, these corporations are obligated in most cases to follow their profit making interest in opposing all emission regulations. In contrast, stakeholder corporations, at least in the long run, should support global emission rights, utilizing a market solution that has some claims to be more efficient than other methods, but which in any case is highly compatible with corporate capitalism. Moreover, stakeholder corporations should support transition towards a relatively restrictive regulatory regime , in which: major restrictions would be global rather than local global restrictions would apply in all cases of persistent emissions global restrictions would apply to non-persis tent emissions as well, unless they have been affirmatively shown to be safe using reasonably persuasive scientific evidence safety thresholds would be set fairly restric tively, based if necessary on approximate models and administrative rules of thumb, in light of existing scientific knowledge but without requiring full scientific justification long-run goals would include zero emission of persistent unsafe substances. However, most stakeholder corporations have short-run interests that conflict with these goals.</page><page sequence="3">What Global Emission Regulations should Corporations Support? 319 These short-run interests can be accommodated using phase-in rules. Phase-in rules are less accept able under Marxian and common ethics. Material interests, emission regulations, and planning horizons It is controversial whether corporations are bur dened only by a narrow pragmatic duty to advance their own profit-making interests, or by broader ethical concerns. But in either case, its narrow material self-interest as an institution does impose prudential responsibilities on the corporation as a political (as well as economic) agent. In this regard, there are distinct chasms between short-run, med ium-run, and long-run material interests. The short run In a very short run, pragmatic profit-maximization by a corporation generally implies opposition to any new and compulsory restrictions on its own emissions. In some cases, however, relationships with stakeholders (who may include workers, customers, suppliers, and persons living in physical proximity to production facilities) create a pru dential interest in restraining harmful emissions voluntarily. In general, this will occur when stakeholders have the power to impose costs on the corporation in retaliation for unwanted emis sions. For example, stakeholders may have rights under tort law to sue for damages. Also, workers affected by pollution might go out on strike, while (depending on competitive conditions) customers and suppliers may have opportunities to withdraw from ongoing transactions. A corporation would tend to oppose new and compulsory controls on its own emissions, even if, as suggested by stakeholder theory, the corporation has important goals that go beyond profit maxi mization. As long as profit maximization is one of its important goals, voluntary restrictions leave the corporation in a better position than compulsory restrictions to balance profit maximization against other goals. In unusual cases a given corporation might sup port compulsory restrictions on the emissions of other corporations, if those emissions disadvantaged the first corporation. Nevertheless, in a very short run, most corporations have a strong material interest in creating and supporting a coalition of all corpora tions to oppose all short-run restrictions on corpo rate emissions. Moreover, if such a coalition is unable to defeat regulations outright, then the interests of its mem bers are to weaken the regulations as far as possible, for example by: making the regulations local rather than national or global; putting the burden of proof on regulators to show beyond a reasonable doubt that each re stricted substance is harmful, and that safety thresholds are scientifically justified; putting the burden of regulation on authorities to measure emissions and show that emitters are in violation of regulations beyond a reasonable doubt. It does not follow that short-run profit-maxi mizing corporations would oppose regulations of all kinds ? this conclusion is specific to the regulation of emissions. Corporations do often find it in their short-run interest to support regulations. For example, regulations that create an orderly market place may tend to expand that market as a whole, benefitting all firms in that market. Corporations may also support regulations in their role as a cus tomer of other firms. What distinguishes the regu lation of emissions is that firms (at least in their profit-making role) rarely have any strong or specific short-run interest in a pollution-free environment. The medium run In a medium run, however, an anti-regulatory coalition of firms is likely to be unstable. A cor poration's short-run interest in opposing new reg ulations is largely an artifact of sunk costs in investments not adapted to those regulations. Once existing capital has been replaced by new capital adapted to the regulations, economic theory sug gests that (with other factors held constant) profit margins will be as they were before, while the incentive to oppose regulation will either be</page><page sequence="4">320 David Burress reduced or eliminated. In equilibrium, there is no a priori reason why well-designed emission regulations should affect the aggregate profitability of the cor porate sector one way or the other ? efficiently chosen emission regulations create as many new investment opportunities as they destroy. If regu lations are long-standing, or if the substance of future regulations is known far in advance (so that all investments are adapted to those regulations), then corporations have no collective interest in opposing them. That is not to say that individual corporations will have no incentives to bend or relax long-standing regulations. Indeed, there will always be incentives in individual cases to cheat or to lobby for changes. But at the same time, other businesses have made investments adapted to the existing regulated envi ronment and have offsetting incentives to police cheating and to oppose changes in regulations. Consequently there is no collective interest in opposing existing regulations. The long run By "long-run interest" we mean the goals the cor poration holds today when planning for a very long time horizon. The over-riding long-run goal of a corporation (if it has one; see below) is, arguably, simply to survive. Corporations, unlike human beings, have no natural limit on longevity. Hence they potentially have a super-human incentive to take a very long view. While corporations can adapt over time, survival in a recognizable form is condi tioned on survival of an environment conducive to the corporate form and its associated legal and social structures. Survival of that environment in turn is conditioned on reasonably efficient regulatory pol icy. Consequently, each corporation arguably has a long-run material interest in the existence of sus tainable public regulatory policies. Sustainability has several aspects. Biological sus tainability implies that regulations should be designed to preserve human life, as well the exis tence of an ecology which can support that life. Social and technological sustainability implies that regulations should not merely protect human life in a minimal form, but rather preserve a basis for a high civilization. Political sustainability implies that both the content of regulations, and their process of adoption, should support, or at least not significantly undercut, the legitimacy of the existing political order. Ideological interests Corporations have an actual and perceived collective interest in supporting pro-business attitudes in the policy-making sphere. For example, U.S. corpora tions and their owners have historically made dis proportionately large campaign contributions to the Republican party and to candidates who support deregulation and other laissez faire policies. Many of these political investments seem intended to advance a general ideology rather than opposition to any one specific regulation. Ideological investments of this type are directed to medium-run and long-run goals. They are ineffec tive as a short-run tactic because it takes time to establish an ideological regime, because the rein forcement of an established ideology has little short run payoff to a firm seeking particularized action, and because ideological investments create collective or public goods.5 Laissez faire ideology is not the only possible ideology, and not necessarily the best possible ide ology, for supporting medium- to long-run business interests.6 However, analyzing the political and economic efficacy of various business ideologies would take us beyond the scope of this essay. Instead I will abstract away from ideological interests. Reconciling interests These considerations suggest many theoretical questions. How can short-run and long-run interests be reconciled? Are these various pragmatic interests determinative, or are there broader ethical require ments? If there are competing ethical requirements, are special incentives needed to lead corporations to override their pragmatic interests? While it can't completely avoid these general questions, this essay is concerned with a more spe cific application. Should corporations support, op pose, or take no position on regulation of emissions? What form should the regulatory regime supported</page><page sequence="5">What Global Emission Regulations should Corporations Support? 321 by corporations take? In particular, what is its geo graphical scope (local, national, regional, global)? Who bears the burden of proof for applying restrictions (are emissions innocent until proven guilty, or is there an affirmative obligation to dem onstrate safety prior to production of emissions)? Who bears the regulatory burden (measurement by each producer, or burden on regulators to demon strate a violation)? How will distributional effects of regulation be handled (in particular, who receives the initial emission rights)? Incorporation and obligation This paper is part of a more general conversation on corporate responsibility - a conversation on actions that corporations ought to perform. Corporate actions subject to ethical responsibilities could potentially include actions in the political sphere intended to affect the legal and regulatory regime. "Responsibility" includes legal responsibility, contractual responsibility, and ethical responsibility. Before we discuss detailed responsibilities concern ing emissions, we need to ask what the two com peting theories of the corporation imply for these three forms of responsibility in general. Empirical versus normative theories of the corporation Theories of the corporation are of two types: empirical or descriptive theory ? how do corpora tions actually behave? - and normative theory ? how should they behave? Our concern here is with normative theory, but we do need to take empirical behavior of the firm into account. Stakeholder theory is generally presented as hav ing both empirical and normative versions. In con trast, neoclassical theory originated as, and still is most often presented as, a purely empirical theory in economics (e.g., in the microeconomic text by Varian, 1992). Some economists however do make openly normative arguments. For example, it is commonly argued that corporate leaders who fail to maximize profits waste social resources, which is ethically undesirable (Friedman, 1962).7 It will also be apparent from even a cursory reading of editorials in publications such as The Wall Street Journal that, in practice, variants of neoclassical theory are widely accepted as normative theories within the business community.8 Finally, it has also come to receive substantial attention in academic studies of business ethics. (&lt;Strict'' neoclassical theory "Neoclassical" is a general term sometimes equated with mainstream Anglo-American economics as a whole. Because that tradition is so broad, it tends to lack unified normative implications for particular cases. In this essay I intend a much stricter definition. In this strict theory, corporations both as an empir ical fact do, and as a normative principle should, act solely so as to as to maximize profits. Strict neoclas sical theory addresses many possible Umitations or constraints on profit maximization, but in general these constraints are taken to be external rather than internal. In particular, corporations may face tech nological restrictions, capital restrictions, market restrictions, legal and regulatory restrictions, cost of obtaining external information, cost of transacting with other agents, and so on. However, the corpo ration itself is assumed to be unitary, to know its own mind, and to make decisions without incurring internal cost of information and transaction. "Profit maximization" refers to maximizing the expected net present value of the firm's future cash flow stream (see e.g., Malinvaud 1987). Discounting future profits to the present provides the basis for reconciling short-run and longer-run interests of the corporation. The discount rate used for calculating present values is based on market rates (see note 17 for further discussion). Normative neoclassical theory encourages the firm to engage in (internally unconstrained) profit maximization. The ethical basis for this theory rests on the "invisible hand." In particular, under cer tain assumptions (including competitive markets and government regulations that prevent market failures) profit maximization leads to maximization of a particular aggregate of everybody's utility. In some contexts (e.g., note 14), we will need to describe the behavior of individual employees. In the strict neoclassical theory, employees are moti vated by a simple desire to maximize their own material consumption. Moreover, the corporation</page><page sequence="6">322 David Burress has full information about each employee's actions and motivations. Consequently the corporation can always control their behavior fully by manipulating their material incentives. These assumptions on worker behavior add nothing to the definition of the unitary profit maximizing corporation; they simply spell out some logical implications of assuming a unitary corporation. "Semi-strict" neoclassical theory In all probability, few people accept neoclassical normative theory in the stark or extreme form as sumed here. Economist for example use economic models in a flexible fashion, such that the particular assumptions are adapted to the particular circum stances. If strict neoclassical theory leads to unac ceptable ethical positions (as I will argue it does), then most people will feel free to modify the empirical or normative assumptions as needed to avoid reaching those positions. That is not to say that analyzing the strict neo classical firm is a useless straw-man argument. By pointing out impHcations of the strict neoclassical theory, we can suggest why that theory is norma tively unacceptable, and also inform the search for a better theory. If, as almost everyone seems to agree, the world is more efficient if corporations internalize at least some ethical principles (beyond profit-max imizing) than if they do not, then aU normatively acceptable corporations are stakeholder firms in some degree; the only question is how far to take it. A common proposal for relaxing the strict theory adds a single condition (in addition to profit maxi mization) stating that firms should obey the law. This relaxation turns out not be helpful. The immediate problem for our analysis is that there seems to be no reasonable version of utilitarianism that leads to lawfulness but not other conditions. More importantly, imposing lawfulness does not relevantly change corporate goals - law-abiding firms would be just as vocaUy opposed to pollution regulation as law-breaking firms, since nothing in current law discourages self-interested behavior in opposing regulation. (Law-abiding firms would no doubt use less ruthless methods to seek those goals than law-breaking firms, but choice of lobbying methods is outside the scope of this paper.) A more interesting suggestion is Friedman's more general proposal that corporations should obey "the rules of the game ... engag(ing) in open and free competition ..." While this is far from clear language, it does suggest that firms might have obligations not to take advantage of certain market failures ? but infer ring implications for regulatory lobbying would not be possible without more detailed specification. Stakeholder theory Stakeholder theory is generally discussed using lan guage common to fields such as public administra tion, business administration, or sociology, often based on a Kantian perspective. I will define it in stead using utilitarian language taken from the public finance and social choice branches of mainstream economics. This language supports a cleaner con frontation with neoclassical theory. Stakeholder theory (in my model) assumes that the corporation both does and should follow rules of behavior that are expected to maximize a social welfare function (i.e., a weighted aggregation) over the utility functions of "stakeholders." Or in alternative language, a stakeholder corporation pursues a "common good" for its stakeholders (Argando?a, 1998), based on some reasonable operationalization of the idea of a common good. "Stakeholders" are defined to include all persons directly affected by actions of the corporation. Strict neoclassical theory could be thought of as a special case of stakeholder theory in which utility weights are zero for all persons except sharehold ers; therefore we can distinguish stakeholder the ory by assuming that utility weights are positive for all directly affected persons. Note however, that I will define "strict neoclas sical theory" as act-utilitarian (agents directly maxi mize social welfare = profits), while "stakeholder theory" is rule-utilitarian (agents choose ethical and pragmatic rules that are believed likely in the long run to maximize social welfare = common good). This distinction might seem to stack the deck (e.g., when I argue below that stakeholder corporations should be more willing than neoclassical corpora tions to obey established laws), but I believe it cor responds to a real distinction in how the two theories are presented and used. To formulate a complete stakeholder theory, we would need to specify detailed features of the theory:</page><page sequence="7">What Global Emission Regulations should Corporations Support? 323 how to distinguish which persons "count" - for example, persons direcdy affected by the corporation, as opposed to persons indirectly affected; what the relative utility weights are or how they should be determined; what are the external and internal constraints on action by managers of the corporation. (See Kaler, 2003 for a relevant discussion.) How ever, these issues aren't central to my argument and won't be addressed here. Theories of the firm also need to specify what assumptions are being made about individual utility functions ? i.e., what is assumed about human nature. I will discuss this further below, but in practice neoclassical theory simply equates the utility of shareholders with the profits they receive ? a "thin" goal equivalent to maximizing material consumption ? while stakeholder theory assumes that humans have complex or "thick" goals that cannot be equated with maximizing consumption. In particular, human beings have an innate ethical sense. Other theories While I will not dwell on them extensively, two other ethical approaches of particular interest are Marxian theories, and the generally a-theoretical observed facts of practical ethics that we might call "the common ethics." For purposes of this discus sion, both can be modeled as rule-utilitarian theories that assume humans have "thick" goals. In the "common ethics" model, rules are assumed to be chosen to maximize an aggregate of utilities that gives equal weight to each human being. In a (highly oversimplified) model of "Marxian ethics," rules are chosen to maximize an aggregate of utilities, giving equal weight to each worker, and zero weight to each shareholder. Legal responsibility All theories imply that corporations should gen erally obey the law, but for different reasons, and with differing degrees of conviction. Stakeholder theory is fairly unequivocal about the obligation of the corporation to obey the law. Law abiding behavior is in the interests of stakeholders not merely because law breaking is risky to the cor poration, but more significantly because human beings are conceived of as agents with goals that include a desire for self and others to behave ethicaUy. "Strict" neoclassical theory tends to support obedience to the law, solely because obedience often tends to be a profit-maximizing strategy. In general, strict neoclassical theory necessarily implies that corporations should violate the law whenever they can predicably profit from it. Defenders of neoclassical theory list numerous external forces implying that breaking the law usually wouldn't maximize profits - i.e., reasons why corporations could not expect to "get away with it" These forces are simply the costs that various stake holders can impose on a law-breaking corpora tion: loss of patronage, civil suit, criminal penalties, and so on. Whatever the merits of these arguments ? and there are obvious exceptions to each of these claims - this style of argument implicitly grants that external force is needed at all times to keep each neoclassical corporation in line. Academic theories of law-abiding behavior almost universaUy agree that external pressure from law-enforcement alone is not enough to create a law-abiding society. It is also necessary that most people tend to prefer to obey the law for its own sake. This argument can be made in terms of information costs and transactions costs, but other language says it more succinctly: qui custodiet custodies? In a corrupt society, uncor rupted government won't survive to ride herd on society, or, should it somehow survive untainted, manage the overwhelming task of tracking every aspect of an entity (the entire society) which is much larger than itself. Or to put it more bluntly: there is neither empirical nor theoretical evidence that law-abiding behavior is a stable equilibrium absent individual conscience. As Adam Smith (1759, 1976) was weU aware, there is no invisible hand enforcing law and order ? it cannot descend Hke manna from heaven to re ward the innate virtuousness of a world run on pure greed.</page><page sequence="8">324 David Burress Some neoclassicists have also argued that law breaking need not be bad; for example, that firms engaging in illegal bribery can increase social welfare (e.g., Thursby, et al., 1991). Since the law by and large criminalizes actions judged likely to reduce the general welfare, such arguments are an inadequate normative defense for lawlessness. The main question to be addressed here is not one of obedience to the law, but rather, the corporations^ role in formation of the law. However, attitudes toward obedience to law do foreshadow attitudes towards the ethical content of law-making. Contractual responsibility "Contractual responsibility" refers to obligations accepted by prior agreement To the extent that the contract is clear, the nature of the contracted obli gations is simply a matter of fact. In normative theory there is always a separate ethical question as to whether an agent should or should not actually fulfill its given contractual obligations. Here again, all theories tend to imply an obligation to fulfill con tractual agreements, but with differing degrees of conviction. In stakeholder theory, contractual partners are among the stakeholders whose utility is of positive significance. (In Kantian terms, they are owed the ultimate respect of being treated as ends and not means.) It follows that there is an obligation to obey contracts even when it becomes inconvenient to do so. Such an obligation is not absolute, but it is an important ethical consideration that in particular cases may or may not be in competition with other ethical considerations. In neoclassical theory, there is a purely instru mental relationship between the parties. Contracts are followed only so long as considerations of con tractual gain and future reputation outweigh any potential gains from reneging or hold-up. Ethical responsibilities of the neoclassical firm In the short and medium runs, a strictly neoclassical corporation is obligated only to make a profit. For the long run, I will argue it has no practical interests or obligations at all. Neoclassical corporations are assumed, however, to maximize present values of cash flow streams that last over a potentially unHmited horizon. In other words, the corporation has a positive interest in gaining an additional dollar at any time, no matter how far in the future it will be received. However, that is very far from saying that in practice such a corporation would take a significantly long-run view, because any profits in the distant future are discounted in the extreme. In particular, profit maximization specifically implies that for any given fixed annual real profit continuing over an infinite horizon, there is a finite sum of money large enough that the neoclassical corporation would prefer to receive that amount of profit today, pay it out in dividends, and then go out of business, as opposed to obtaining that stream of profits forever. In itself, that does not necessarily distinguish the neoclassical corporation from the stakeholder corporation. Almost any utiHtarian actor is willing to contemplate an acceleration of its own eventual demise, if the stakes are high enough. What distinguishes the neoclassical corporation is the extremely low value it places in practice on the moderately distant future ? distant events of a magnitude up to and including its own destruction are simply not appreciably significant. It is important to quantify this point. Major cor porations have high internal discount rates, typicaUy weU in excess of 10% per year in real terms. At such rates, standard discounting formulas show that a doUar expected to be received just 7 years in the future is worth much less than half of what a doUar is worth to the firm now. Similarly, a doUar expected to be received in 70 years is worth very much less than 1/1000 of what a doUar received today is worth. Moreover, the present value today of the entire market value of any firm as it wiU be valued in 50 or 100 years is tiny in comparison with just one year's profits received today. 18 (The sole possible excep tion would be cases where the firm is expected to grow exponentiaUy for a prolonged period at a growth rate comparable to or greater than the dis count rate. Historic data on the growth of major corporations imply that expectations of sustained long-run growth at such high rates can never be justified. Indeed, such growth implies that the firm would eventuaUy exceed the entire economy in</page><page sequence="9">What Global Emission Regulations should Corporations Support? 325 size.) Consequently, in practice, a profit maximizing corporation should be quite willing to accept its own certain destruction in 50 or 100 years, in return for an increase by a small percentage in just one year's profits today. Such a firm cannot be said to have appreciable long-run interests. Ethical responsibilities of the stakeholder firm In contrast, the stakeholder corporation does place an appreciable value on events expected 50 100 years in the future. This follows from the fact that the corporation values the utility of its stake holders, who are viewed as real human beings rather than abstract profit-maximizers. In particular, I take it as a primitive sociological or ethical fact that real human beings on average do place an appreciable value on protecting the environmental condition of the world their children and grandchildren will live in.19 Since the stakeholder corporation is motivated by, and solely by, the goals of its stakeholders, it must be appreciably motivated by that particular goal.20 We should not paint a Pollyanna picture of the stakeholder corporation. Human beings have unethical motives as well as ethical motives. The actions of a stakeholder corporation could reflect both kinds of motives. What distinguishes the stakeholder corporation is its potentiality for doing the ethically right thing, even in the absence of any external pressure. The strictly neoclassical corpora tion has no such potentiality. Thus, stakeholder corporations in practice will occasionally face situations where the material utility of their stakeholders could be increased by acts that violate either Marxian ethics or "the common eth ics." These cases arise, in particular, when there is an opportunity to make additional profits in a way commonly viewed as unethical, albeit the profits could be shared across all stakeholders. (These situations are quite similar to, but presumably less common than, the situations that would lead neo classical corporations to behave contrary to common ethics.) Note that, in such cases, if the stakeholder corporation is ethically required to maximize aggregate utility of its stakeholders, and if its stake holders do not place a high-enough utility value on ethics, then the firm is ethically required in these cases to act against common ethical views. This is a clear weakness in stakeholder ethical theory, at least as it is modeled here. The simplest resolution would entail redefining stakeholders very broadly to include aU directly and indirectly affected persons. In a rule-utiHtarian framework, common ethics consists simply in those rules of behavior which tend to maximize an aggregate of every person's utility. If we defined stakeholders broadly enough, then stakeholder ethics would become identical to common ethics. This is not a very satisfactory resolution, however. In particular, there is no evidence that firms actuaUy do accept aU humanity as their stakeholders. (E.g., existing evidence for the empirical version of stake holder theory is based on a narrower definition.) If the normative theory differs too drasticaUy from the empirical reaHty, then in the name of ethics we are caUing on aU corporations to make major changes in their modes of operation. Preaching radical ethical change to corporations seems vacuous. Corporations are a successful form precisely because they almost single-mindedly foUow their own internal dynamic. A more reaHstic approach is to simply accept that normative stakeholder theory is incomplete. In cases where stakeholder theory reaches counterin tuitive ethical results, it wiU be necessary both to rely on the consciences of individual whistleblowers to resist corporate temptation, and also to assume or hope (similarly to neoclassical theory) that external pressure can contain corporate misbehav Ethical criteria Sustainability It is widely argued that corporate environmental behaviors should be sustainable (e.g., Desjardins, 1998), but "sustainabiHty" is an increasingly con tested concept. There are disagreements both over what it should mean in theory to be sustainable, and over how in practice it can or should be accom pHshed. For purposes of this essay, I wiU assume a definition similar to one put forth by some neo classical economists. They focus on "sustainable development" rather than "sustainab?ity." A development regime is said to be sustainable if and</page><page sequence="10">326 David Burress only if the resources left to each generation allow it to achieve a higher general standard of living than its predecessors. The concept of resources includes knowledge and technology and social capital as well as material resources, so the concept is one of "dy namic sustainability" in which (sufficiendy large) increased stocks of knowledge are assumed able to substitute perfectly for any non-renewable resources used up by a given generation. This is the most elastic and least restrictive def inition of sustainability I am aware of. In the form stated above, it is subject to serious challenge. For example, it downplays many problems related to uncertainty, and in particular may not be consis tent with the Precautionary Principle. At the same time, using a lenient standard of sustainability lends rigor to ethical arguments: if a regulatory action is required by this standard, then it is likely to be required by any reasonable standard of sus tainability. Stakeholder firms should tend to support long run policies that are sustainable, because individual stakeholders tend to support such policies. Indeed, I am not aware of any literature other than nihilism that overtly opposes a sustainability ideal. However, neoclassical firms have no particular reason to support sustainability. Fairness between nations Treating people fairly is generally viewed as an ethical requirement, which it is. In the context of distribu tional effects of global regulation of emissions, it may be more helpful to view it as apolitical requirement. In particular, global perceptions ?f fairness are pragmat ically needed in at least some degree in order to reach global agreements on regulation of emissions. For example, consider the case of greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide. There is sci entific agreement that anthropomorphic emissions are substantially contributing to an increase in the earth's temperature, and that climatological, eco nomic and social effects will be large, costly, and partly unpredictable. 6 Cutting back on C02 emis sions is also costly. A majority of the emitted C02 mass currently comes from rich industrialized countries. Those countries are demanding large emission quotas in order to preserve their existing Standard of living. But poor countries also demand large quotas, so that they can develop their econo mies and catch up with rich countries. SmaU poor nations, including most African na tions, probably can be coerced by major patron states into agreements they perceive as unfair. Large poor nations like China and India are much harder to coerce. Enforcement is also problematic if the underlying agreements are perceived as unfair. Emission controls would fail to contain greenhouse gases adequately if just one of the large nations failed to conform. EspeciaUy given the internal political difficulties of imposing controls, some large poor nations are likely to insist on quid pro quos for controUing emissions. Once one poor nation opts out or receives special preferences, other poor na tions are likely to foUow. Hence unfair agreements have a propensity to coUapse. The natural market solution is to grant CO2 emission rights on some basis mutuaUy accepted as equitable 7 (or on a basis of quasi-equitable com promise), and then let rich countries buy some of those rights back from poor countries. The doUar transfers that result would likely be much larger than existing flows of international foreign aid, so the negotiations over quotas would be very difficult. A negotiated basis might include some combination of weighting based on numbers of persons, and weighting based on current GDP. Because of its interest in having a viable world, the stakeholder corporation should support concessions to poor nations in order to achieve global controls, at least in the long run. Because of its essentiaUy short run orientation, the neoclassical corporation should oppose both concessions and controls. Fairness between economic actors Most people believe they have a right not be subjected to unexpected harm resulting from the actions of others, and the laws in aU democratic countries accept this principle as important, though not always deter minative. In some cases individuals have rights to be free not merely from harm, but also from threats of harm. Clearly there are and must be limits to such rights ? if every person in every action took every possible precaution against every possible harm, the economy would grind to a halt. However, in</page><page sequence="11">What Global Emission Regulations should Corporations Support? 327 definable cases of substantial harm in which the cause can be traced to a specific polluter, both law and ethics may hold the polluter liable for tort damages. Tort actions create an incentive against pollution. This incentive constitutes an addition to, but not a sufficient substitute for, any incentives provided by global regulation. In cases regulated globally, there will generally be multiple emission sources for any given pollutant, and also multiple pollutants that can cause any particular harm, so that the specific causal relationship needed for tort action usually cannot be established. Tort action is generally related to a local event that can be handled under local law. However, there are some tort issues that require global attention. First, some torts will concern pollution spilling over na tional boundaries. There is a need for agreed inter national procedures in those cases. Second, when multinational corporations cause great loss of life and health, as in the Bhopal disaster, compensation for loss may be utterly disproportionate depending on income and national location of the victims. These outcomes violate popular ideas of fairness. Perceptions of fairness are important to the legiti macy and stability of a political regime. This is espe cially the case for democratic regimes. Therefore the sustainability of a global political order hospitable to corporations, is likely to depend on ordinary people not believing that order grossly unfair. Tort law may play a rather limited role in feelings about fairness of the international regime (the cultural resonance of the Bhopal disaster however could suggest otherwise). In any case, legitimacy is built up based on many small governmental decisions over time. Tort law includes some of those decisions. Presumptively, stakeholder firms should support globally fair tort laws. Since fairness is a long-run social investment, neoclassical firms should oppose any global tort laws that placed them at significant expected short-run risk. Benefit-cost analysis Utilitarian judgements are couched in the language of "efficiency." Therefore in this paper, "efficient" has approximately the meaning "ethical" or "virtuous." Concrete utilitarian calculations are usually opera tionalized as a monetized comparison of costs and benefits to society as a whole. For convenience, these calculations are normaUy based on the "one doUar one vote" assumption ? in other words, a doUar's worth of benefit or cost has the same social value whether as signed to rich or poor. It is significant that nearly aU benefit-cost theorists agree this standard is ethicaUy flawed - i.e., most agree that a doUar is sociaUy more valuable when received by poor persons than by the rich (reviewed in Burress and Rich, 1997 ). However, for uses made in this paper any conclusions reached under the "one doUar one vote" standard would be even more strongly justified under a more pro-poor standard. Also, "one doUar one vote" arguably does approximate the utilitarian weighting actuaUy used by stakeholder corporations. Moreover, by definition it reflects the weighting used by neoclassical corpora tions. Therefore this paper assumes a "one doUar one vote" standard throughout. Internalization of costs and benefits The benefit-cost approach impHes a fundamental moral axiom: under ideal circumstances, human af fairs should be organized in such a way that each decision maker wiU pay the fuU or "social" costs, and also enjoy the fuU social benefits, that result from each action he or she performs. This axiom foUows rigorously from two assumptions: ethical outcomes consist in maximizing social utiHty or welfare, defined to equal the sum of aU benefits less aU costs of aU actions. individuals, whether or not they intend to act ethicaUy, as an empirical fact do act so as to maximize the benefits, net of costs, that they privately face. In other words, if private net benefits equal social net benefits, then rational individuals wiU automat icaUy maximize social welfare. This axiom remains abstractly true no matter how we decide to define benefits and costs. But to apply it, we have to define what counts as a social cost or benefit. The definitions are different in each of the four normative theories. However in each case they consist in the sum of doUar values placed on aU outcomes by aU individual persons, multiplied by weights for each individual (using weights that are different for each theory).</page><page sequence="12">328 David Burress This axiom has important and direct implication for deciding who should bear the costs of regulation. Under the common ethics, the full costs of regu lating emissions should be usually be borne by those enjoy the benefits of producing the emissions. Un der competitive market conditions, the only way to ensure that is to place the full burden initially on those who decide to produce the emissions. (The costs will then be passed on to the ultimate benefi ciaries through normal market process.) Those costs include: the costs of deciding which emission to regulate the costs of determining an allowed level of emission the costs of measuring actual emissions the costs of enforcing the limits. Marxian ethics reaches a similar conclusion. Stakeholder ethics would generally agree, except that the stakeholder firm should seek phase-in rules as described below. Neoclassical ethics places no value on cost or benefits that accrue to any individual other than shareholders of that particular firm. Accordingly it should support externalization of all costs of pro duction to the maximum extent possible. Technical and legal criteria Emissions Here I will define "emission" very broadly as any existing physical substance, matter, or form of energy produced or caused or utilized by a business or firm and no longer under direct control of it or its customers or supply or distribution chain.32 However, the discus sion will mainly focus on chemical substances. Not every emission constitutes an environmental problem, but every type or species of emitted matter or energy constitutes a potential problem. The difference between problematic and benign emission rests en tirely on the quantity or aggregate density of the emittent at a sensitive location, in relation to the level of hazard presented by that emittent. Thus, oxygen and nitrogen are naturally occurring substances nec essary to dominant forms of life, yet huge emissions of either can cause a local problem. (Concentrated oxygen is chemicaUy risky to Hfe forms, and can also cause explosions. Concentrated nitrogen is suffocat ing.) Conversely, even the most deadly toxin is harmless if released in sufficiently minute quantities. Persistent emittents It foUows that persistent emittents are a much more serious problem than degradable emittents. To the extent that a substance persists in the environment and is continuously created, it wiU build up without limit. And if it builds up without limit, then even tuaUy it wiU become a nuisance. Moreover, if the degree of nuisance builds up without Hmit, then the costs it imposes also bu?d up without limit. Therefore, in the extreme case of perfect persis tence (or perfect non-degradab?ity), the only per manently sustainable level of emission is zero. It does not foUow that use of such substances should be banned, only that they should not be continuously released into the environment in non-diminishing amounts. In practice, however, nearly aU uses of material substances do entail some degree of release into the environment. A purely theoretical exception consists in substances used in highly controUed pro duction processes and never released into the envi ronment. As far as I know, there are no practical examples of perfectly contained production processes. There is also the theoretical possib?ity of releasing a persistent emittent for a temporary period, until a certain threshold is reached, and then ceasing forever to use or release it. In practice, no emittent is perfectly persistent. However, there is a strong long-run case for banning emission of any highly persistent substance. In or dinary language, persistence is a relative notion; a substance is environmentaUy persistent if both: the processes of degradation operate more slowly than the processes of emission, and the level of emission is high enough to cause a hazard. It is always the case that a sufficiently high rate of emission could in principle overwhelm the degrada tion process and cause a hazardous level of an emittent. Therefore "persistence" is a notion that has to be</page><page sequence="13">What Global Emission Regulations should Corporations Support? 329 operationalized administratively, in the light of actual conditions of production volume and use. Consequendy, under any administrative defini tion of persistence some emissions classed as non persistent will still constitute nuisances. Thus, even if a substance degrades rapidly in the natural environ ment, it can still constitute a nuisance if it is suffi ciently hazardous and sufficiently mobile, or is delivered in inconvenient locations. Degradation Degradation of a pollutant occurs when the pollutant is broken down into other substances, or when it is permanendy removed from the active biosphere. Both concepts are problematical. The break-down of a hazardous pollutant often produces other hazardous pollutants. Therefore degradation should not be viewed as complete until all hazardous byproducts of all generations have been degraded below an acceptable level of hazard. Moreover, breakdown in the natural environment proceeds variably, and does not generally mimic breakdown in the laboratory. It follows that envi ronmental break-down of a particular emittent for regulatory purposes will have to be defined admin istratively, in the light of available scientific knowl edge but with a necessary degree of arbitrariness. Similarly, permanent removal from the biosphere is a relative concept. For example, because of pro cesses such as erosion, solution, and evaporation, substances buried in the earth are generally not permanently removed from the biosphere. Also, procedures such as launching radioactive materials into outer space may permanently remove a potential emittent, but they run the risk of failing disastrously. Again, administrative definitions will be needed. Mobility If an emittent remained forever where it was emitted, it would not present a global problem. However, substances that are airborne or waterborne or soluble or biologically active do not remain in one place. Also, complex substances such as trash include components that fall into all of these categories. Moreover, in some cases human agency moves otherwise immobile materials; for example radioactive metals have been unknowingly reclaimed from waste dumps and recycled by scavengers. Even relatively slowly dispersing substances wiU eventuaUy cover the globe if they are sufficiently persistent. Therefore immobiHty by itself should rarely be a sufficient reason to avoid global regula tion of an emittent. In the long run, low mob?ity should be administratively significant only when combined with low persistence and low hazard. Interactions among emissions It is possible for various species of emission to potentiate each other, or work jointly to increase the level of hazard, or interact chemically to create new hazards (as in smog). The simplest situation is one where multiple species have essentiaUy the same effects (hormone mimickers and estrogen disrupters are possible examples). In that case aU of the sirrular species need to be regulated as a unit, so that their total environmental load does not exceed regulatory limits. Because some hazards involve non-linear ef fects (e.g., doubling the concentration might more than double the harm; Goldstein and Goldstein, 2002, pp. 77-79), setting appropriate joint limits can be technicaUy complicated. A larger problem is that most of the possible interactions among different species are not known in advance. Moreover the number of possible interactions is increasing explosively (it increases with the square of the number of species). Assuring a reasonable level of safety would require extensive and systematic technical analysis. At present no country is attempting such an analysis, either before or after emissions are permitted into the environ ment. Because of the sheer size of the research problem, administrative rules wiU be needed that define various classes of possible interaction, some of which are presumptively innocuous. The political economy of global regulation If hazards from a particular poUutant are known to have a purely local incidence, the case for regulating it globaUy is rather weak. Also, there is an important distinction between hazardous local con</page><page sequence="14">330 David Burress centrations of an emittent, versus a hazardous aver age global level. I will assume that global regula tion is concerned with the average global level of emittents, and that other problems can be handled locally. Presumably, local regulation will assist the global regulation effort, but the two efforts have different goals and standards. However, even in cases where pollution has a global incidence, in principle its regulation could be accomplished through independent but parallel national or local regulations that covered the globe. In practice, parallel regulation is very likely to fail because of free rider problems. In particular, when a given locality regulates a global pollutant, the costs of regulation are borne locally, while the benefits are shared globally. While local regulation may pass ethical tests, it does not pass a locally oriented ben efit-cost test. Because of free rider problems, local voters are unlikely to support restrictive regulations they do not significandy benefit from. For these reasons, poUtical economy models (such as Oate's "fiscal federalism" model, 1972) suggest that regu latory systems should have authority over at least the same geographical range as the hazard that is being regulated. Consequently, if truly global emission problems are not regulated globally, whether through inter national agreements or by independent international agencies, they not Ukely to be regulated successfully. Hence stakeholder firms short support global regu lation, at least in the long run. Globally distributed emittents A detectable level of emittents from a given release event will spread out over a region that depends on quantity, detectability, degradation rate, and mobility of the emittent, and also on wind and water currents and on the period of time between emission and detection. However, any persistent and moderately mobile emittent released in sufficient quantity will eventually be detectable everywhere on the globe. DDT, for example, is still detectable everywhere on the globe now, several decades after its production was banned in the U.S. (for citations, see Schafersman, 2000). Morever, any persistent emittent released cumulatively in quantities that are large enough in relationship to its level of hazard, will eventually cause damage throughout the globe. DDT, for example, which is beHeved to cause egg sheU thinning that re duces the survival rates of certain bird species, is stiU being found in the tissues of those birds. It foUows that every persistent emittent poses a global regulatory problem. While it is possible that cumulative production quantities and hazard levels are and wiU remain low enough for a particular emittent that it need never be regulated, there is no way to know whether or not that is case prior to a careful regulatory examination. Therefore, in order to successfuUy manage poUution as a global problem, every persistent emittent should presumptively be globally regulated, at least up to the point of determining from time to time that no Hmits are currently needed. Some non-persistent emittents wiU also present global problems because of a combination of high mobiHty and high hazard. These emittents should be regulated like persistent emittents. The burden of proof for global regulation Thus there is a threshold problem of deciding whether or not a given emittent requires global regulation. In some cases, global regulatory agencies might be able to settle this issue categoricaUy. For example, substances that naturaUy occur in human environments in significant quantities could be presumed not to be global nuisances until there is evidence to the contrary. However, in the case of new artificial substances, categorical rules wiU usuaUy be unhelpful. The choice finaUy comes down either to burdening the regulator to show potential haz ardousness ? "innocent until proven gu?ty" ? or else to burdening the producer to show probable innocuousness ? "guilty until proven innocent." Also, once a decision has been made to impose global regulation, we must assign the burden of proof for determining acceptable rates of emission (or whether any level of emission is permissable). Thousands of new artificial chemical are invented each year, and the rate keeps increasing. 8 A rather substantial fraction of those new chemicals are likely to be hazardous in various ways. Flooding the environment with new and untested chemicals would in effect (and at present actuaUy does) use aU human beings as involuntary test subjects. Ordinary people overwhelmingly report in pubHc opinion</page><page sequence="15">What Global Emission Regulations should Corporations Support? 331 polls that they oppose involuntary applications of untested artificial chemicals to human beings (e.g., Morris et al., 1993). The stakeholder corporation, though not the neoclassical corporation, should have a long-run interest in supporting regulations that respect those views. At the same time, the introduction of new tech nology has always used human beings as partially involuntary test subjects. Moreover, new technology has great benefits to ordinary people. I am aware of no attitude surveys weighing trade-offs between the benefits of new technology and the costs of serving as involuntary guinea pigs. It is not feasible to test all new technologies perfectly before they are intro duced into the human environment. Presumably, there is some positive level of risk that average people would be wiUing to accept in order to enjoy the general benefits of progress and a steady stream of new technology. The problem lies in setting an appropriate level of risk. ? Assignment of the burden of proof has strong impUcations for the level of risk imposed on the public: risks wiU be substantiaUy higher if govern ment regulators accept the burden than if private innovators accept it. Regulators (like government in general) have relatively fixed and Umited budget constraints, so the studies they are able to fund and instigate on their own w?l normaUy leave large gaps (e.g., as in U.S. Labor Department studies of workplace safety). If the burden rests on the inno vator then there wiU normaUy be no gaps (e.g., as in FDA approvals of new drugs). Arguing from an oversimpUfied model of inno vation, the axiom of cost internalization implies it is sociaUy efficient to place the fuU costs of safety analysis on the producers of a new technology. In particular, if innovators can use patents and other devices to recapture the fuU social benefits of inno vation in the form of profits, then they wiU enjoy the fuU social benefits of any innovation. If they bear the fuU social costs as weU, then they wiU make sociaUy optimal investments in innovation. Therefore the innovating firm should accept the main burden of showing that global regulation is not needed, or if it is needed, that some particular level of emission is safe. Under more reaUstic models of innovation, firms are Ukely to underinvest in innovation, mainly be cause of "spiUovers" ? i.e., some benefits of inno vation are absorbed by customers, suppliers, competitors who mimic the innovation, future innovators, and government taxation (Jaffe, 1998). Consequently, achieving sociaUy optimal innovation generaUy requires a degree of pubHc subsidy. Assuming no better form of subsidy is available, one possible form consists in shifting the burden of proof from innovators to regulators. This reduces costs to innovators, but at the social cost of a higher level of public risk. However, it already the case that a wide variety of direct fiscal subsidies are available for innovation in the U.S. and elsewhere. These fiscal subsidies in clude government grants, use of spinoffs from uni versity research, R&amp;D tax credits, and numerous state and local economic development programs in every state of the union. If existing fiscal subsidies aren't high enough, they could be increased. There are many policy reasons for preferring fiscal subsidies over the sociaHzation of risk: fiscal subsides are more transparent (it's easier to measure the amount of money involved); they are openly adopted in a democratic manner on a case-by-case basis; they seem more fair to ordinary citizens than risk subsi dies; (in my view most importantly) fiscal subsidies are paid in fungible doUar terms, wh?e risk subsidies are paid in the nonfungible coins of environmental loss, bad health and death. Transparency, the first of these poHcy reasons, cuts both ways. Fiscal subsidies, like aU government programs, are limited by the government's budget constraint. Government programs are typicaUy un derfunded, in the sense that the marginal benefit from a doUars' program expenditure usuaUy exceeds a doUar in social value. Hence fiscal subsidies to innovation are likely to be underfunded. As with any subsidy, its supporters wiU look for an off-books way to increase the subsidy. Shifting the burden of proof is one such way. Government programs are generaUy kept on books and visible for a very good reason: citizens want to maintain oversight. The stakeholder cor poration should support fiscal subsidies to innova tion, while keeping the burden of proof on producers of new emittents. The neoclassical firm should attempt to externalize cost whenever possi ble, hence should support putting the burden of proof on regulators (even if it leads to negative externalities that are "unfair" or sociaUy inefficent).</page><page sequence="16">332 David Burress Implications of dynamic sustainability Any emittents generated today could potentiaUy be cleaned up using tomorrow's more effective tech nologies. Therefore any given future effect of pol lution can conceivably be ignored. This argument probably impUes no particular change in the threshold question of whether to trigger global regulation, but it does suggest change in the level of control. I wiU argue, however, that any such changes would be slight. Let us imagine, for example, that a technology for cleaning up a given substance emitted today is ex pected to exist tomorrow, such that: expected costs of cleanup tomorrow, when discounted to the present, are less than the ex pected benefits of relaxing emission regulations today; the costs of developing the new cleanup tech nology wiU be borne by producers of the emittents; the two previous conditions are known to true with high reUability and relatively low risk; the costs of estabUshing truth of the two previous conditions are borne by producers of the emit tents. Then it would clearly be justified under aU four ethical theories to base emission controls on current nuisance levels only, while ignoring future nuisance. However, if any one of the above conditions fail to hold, then. relaxing the level of control is not justified (except under neoclassical ethics). If for example we aUowed extra emissions based on the mere plausib?ity of future cleanup, then in most cases emission controls would have to be relaxed, because future techniques may plausibly exist to clean up any global poUutant at low cost. Our historic experience however has been that ex post cleanup of poUution is immensely expensive, so mere plausibility of cheaper cleanup in the future is an unsatisfactory basis for imposing high costs on the next generation. Moreover, efforts (including formal efforts) to forecast technology have historicaUy been unreliable and nearly always over-optimistic. Wh?e continued technological progress could eventuaUy produce almost any imaginable miracle, most of the hoped-for miracles won't happen soon enough to help the next generation. Phase-in rules Stakeholder corporations (like aU corporations) have strong short-run interests contrary to regulation of their currently existing emittents. To advance those interests, they should support weU balanced transi tion rules that put some costs of regulation off into the future. For example, aU new chemical species introduced after a certain date could be subject to fuU regulations, while existing species could be given special status for a Hmited period of time. Special status might warrant temporarily shifting the burden of proof to regulators, aUowing temporarily higher levels of hazard, or initiaUy assigning some emission rights to producers. In this regard, it should be noted that corporate stakeholder ethics are different from common and Marxian ethics. Average people would benefit much less from short-run corporate profits than would corporate stakeholders. Consequently both the common ethics and Marxian ethics would be much less favorably inclined to support phase-in rules. Neoclassical corporations, on the other hand, should support the most dilatory phase-in rules that are politicaUy achievable. Conclusion Stakeholder corporations have an affirmative ethical obligation to lobby for strong and uniform interna tional controls over emissions. Their obHgation is not merely to refrain from opposing regulation. In stead, there is an affirmative obHgation to support regulation. This obligation flows primarily from long-run a concern for the weU-being of its stake holders, coupled with the unique position of the firm in providing relevant information to legisla tures. This obligation does not preclude advocacy for transitional rules intended to protect short-run profits. Stakeholder firms should also support careful attention to the deta?ed design of regulatory mechanisms from the point of view of social effi ciency, regulatory effectiveness, and fairness (topics</page><page sequence="17">What Global Emission Regulations should Corporations Support? 333 on which there is a large Uterature). In the long run, optimal designs are likely to include features such as free trading of emission rights; fair and efficient initial distribution of emission rights; globaUy de fined tort rights; innovation subsidies to help offset impacts of regulation on technological progress; fuU public accounting for aU material inputs and outputs of each enterprise; organizational approaches to speed up regulatory action. In contrast, strictly neoclassical corporations are bound by profit maximizing interests. Consequently they have no ethical duty to support regulation. On the contrary, their duty to maximize profits generaUy obligates them to oppose aU regulation of emissions, at least in the short run. A case can be made that lobbying behavior of actuaUy existing international corporations generally resembles the neoclassical standard and is far re moved from the stakeholder standard (e.g., Beder, 1997). Corporations often lobby against environ mental regulations, while there are few cases of corporations supporting them. Assuming that corporations have the power to influence regulations and not merely to obey or disobey them, we should ask whether strict neo classical theory is an appropriate ethical theory at aU. I would argue that it is not - i.e., that the recom mendations of strict neoclassical theory violate most people's sense of what the primitive ethical facts of the case are. According to the neoclassical thesis, social welfare can be maximized if production is performed by profit maximizing firms that are constrained by competition and by appropriate government regulation. If corpo rations have some degree of market power and are in the position of choosing their own governmental constraints, this thesis makes no sense. Profit maxi mizing corporations that can set their own rules wiU simply set them so as to maximize profits. This would generaUy imply, for example, no controls at aU on corporate emissions. Such an outcome does not maximize welfare (if, as it is commonly understood, welfare means an equaUy weighted aggregate of everyone's utility). This violates the underlying pre mise that maximizing private profits simultaneously maximizes social welfare. Thus, if corporations have the power to set, or even to seriously influence, the rules under which they operate, the ethical premises of neoclassical theory are void. Corporate managers no doubt have different exigencies than other stakeholders. Perhaps the question is fundamentaUy one of incentives. For example, corporate managers have short-run employment contracts that may impose a short-run view. If their incentives were changed, corporate behavior might change towards stakeholder norms. One kind of countervailing incentive can be simple public recognition of moral obHgation ? i.e., jawboning and moral suasion. If corporate leaders are faced with clear social messages that their existing behavior is wrong, then voluntary change may be possible. And if there is social agreement but no change in behavior, then stronger sanctions are possible. Taking such steps depends on reaching social agreements. The purpose of an essay such as this is to provoke negotiations toward social agreement on what obligations corporations should actuaUy have.

Notes A point made previously in the corporate citizenship literature. Thus Derber (2003) argues that corporations should lobby for law changes to support a stakeholder approach; Paladino and WiUi (2002) say that corporations do and should exert ethicaUy guided political leadership. This point is beginning to work its way into accepted standards; thus the 5th general policy principle of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprise (OECD, 2000) states that multinational companies should "refrain from seeking or accepting exemptions not contemplated in the statutory or regulatory framework related to environmental, health, safety, labour, taxation, financial incentives, or other issues." Friedman (1962, 1970) is the seminal source, but his approach is not quite "strict" - see footnotes 7 and 11 below. As Friedman insists, profit maximization is an ethical principle, owed by managers to shareholders.</page><page sequence="18">334 David Burress Similar conclusions are reached more informaUy by CaHfornia Global Corporate AccountabiHty Project (2002). Particular emission regulations tend to reduce private productivity in the regulated industry wh?e increasing social productivity. The aggregate of aU regulations could conceivably either reduce or improve average private productivity of firms. However, it is not obvious what effect either direction of change would have on the average rate of profit. The rate of profit is related mainly to the distribution of income between capital and other factors of production, rather than to private or social ability to produce that income. In the sense of Olson (1971). In particular, the effects of an ideology are shared broadly across many poHcies affecting many interests, wh?e the costs of establishing an ideological regime are generaUy large in comparison with the benefits for any one political actor. Corporate support for laissez faire ideology is not consistent with the goals of the stakeholder corporation as developed below. It can be consistent with goals of the strict neoclassical corporation, but supporting other ideologies can also be consistent, depending on empir ical conditions. For example, neoclassical corporations might reasonably focus solely on maximizing profits and take no stand on ideological issues, because doing otherwise would not benefit the firm (e.g., because of free rider problems). Alternatively, a very large neo classical firm might have a medium-run motive to support regulations maximizing social welfare because it is positioned to share in global increases in welfare. Since profit-making is its only standard, the ideology supported by a neoclassical firm does not have to be either "true" or consistent with normative neoclassical theory. And in particular, laissez faire ideology is not consistent with the "invisible hand" underpinnings of neoclassical theory - except under unpersuasive eco nomic assumptions such as zero transaction costs and absence of externalities. Thus, in a realistic model that includes market imperfections, laissez faire policies do not maximize welfare - hence strictly profit maximizing behavior can be normatively justified only in a regulated environment. It has been argued to the contrary that neoclassical ethics and laissez faire ideology can be jointly justified by theories of government failure. These arguments are unpersuasive. To say that firms ethicaUy should maximize profits, and also should support laissez faire policies, even in the face of known market fa?ures, is to assert that all efforts to remedy those fa?ures w?l predictably decrease welfare, whether those efforts consist in intervention on the part of government, or in particular ethicaUy motivated behav iors on the part of the corporation. Such an assertion has no basis either in evidence or in generaUy accepted economic theory. However, Friedman's normative theory does include certain ethical standards in addition to profit maximization: "there is one and only one responsibiUty of business ? to use its resources and engage in activities to increase its profits, so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition, without deception or fraud." (Friedman, 1962, p. 133). (But why just these particular standards? Also, exactly which "rules of the game" should the corporation recognize?) 8 Thus the Business Roundtable (1997, p. 3), an organi zation of CEOs of major corporations, recently declared 4'the paramount duty of management and the board is to the stockholders; the interests of other stakeholders are relevant as a derivative of the duty to stockholders." That describes a perfectly strict neo classicism. Fleming (1987) found that Friedman was the most widely cited authority in business ethics, with both approval and disapproval. However, I have not found a thorough appraisal or synthesis of that discussion. Modern empirical theories of industrial organization relax these assumptions, for example, by introducing agency and information costs within the firm. Any such relaxation apparently opens the door to empirical and normative considerations paraUeling stakeholder theory. Thus there is a sense in which strict neoclassical theory and stakeholder theory bracket aU possibihties that occur in recent mainstream economics literature. Or more specificaUy on coroUaries of the First Theorem of Welfare Economics (see e.g., Little, 2002, Chapter 3). The competitive equ?ibrium maximizes a "one doUar one vote" welfare function, i.e., an aggregate of individual utilities in doUar metric (with the equilibrium prices used as reference prices to normalize the doUar metric). Friedman (1962, 1970) makes a number of normative arguments in addition to the invisible hand argument, but none of them seem compeUing if the invisible hand theorem fails. In particular, if in fact the world would be a better place if shareholders required their managers to obey specific ethical rules, then most people would say that share holders do have some degree of obUgation to impose those rules, and managers to foUow them. 12 Smart (1967) points out that the Kantian categorical imperative can usefuUy be viewed as a form of rule utilitarianism concerned with ideal rules in an ideal society (as contrasted with practical rules in an existing society). Hence stakeholder theory might best be sum marized as a form of "ideal-rule-utilitarianism." For a survey of theories of crime, see Void and Bernard (1986). The sole near-exception is that rational choice deterrence theory treats conscience and social</page><page sequence="19">What Global Emission Regulations should Corporations Support? 335 pressure as exogenous or random uncontroUed variables. The empirical successes of deterrence theory are far from overwhelming (e.g., Learner, 1983). 14 Of course this oversimpHfies a complicated issue. For example, in face-to-face societies law-abiding behavior can be enforced through social pressure. However, by assumption the strict neoclassical corporation can select, acculturate, associate, and reward its employees appro priately so as to overcome any aversion they may have to external disapproval. Also, it is certainly possible to have social structures based on terror in which each individual monitors the good behavior of every other individual. The coUapse of the Soviet empire showed us once again just how unstable such arrangements are. The argument is presented here as if in a world of perfect certainty. Risk and uncertainty strongly reinforce the same conclusions. 16 In particular, nothing abides forever. To a utilitarian, the point of maintaining existence during the period between now and inevitable doom is to enjoy some quality of experience that could happen in that interim. The enjoyment of experience is variable. The ultimate utilitarian measure of the value of a positive increment in that enjoyment would be the degree of wiUingness to sacrifice part of the later period of survival in order to obtain it now. Studies suggest that a diversified portfolio of stocks can be expected to have a long-run real return of 8% or 10% per year. (Even in the recession year 2001, the median return on equity of Fortune 500 companies was 10.4%; Fortune, 2002.) Since market stock investments are always available to the firm, the market rate of return creates a hurdle that any internal investment must meet. The internal discount rate substantiaUy exceeds the market rate because of taxes, risk aversion, and capital constraints that prevent funding aU available projects. With a market discount rate of p, profit growth rate of g, and profit rate of n?, the market value at time t is (n/(p ? g)) ?. If the internal discount rate is r, then the internal present value at time 0 of the firm's market value of time t is (n/(p -?))&amp;~{r~g)t. If for example r-g &gt; p-g &gt; 0.08/year and t &gt; 70 years, then the ratio ofthat present value to current annual profit [i.e., (l/(p-g))s~(r_g)t] is consider ably less than 0.1. That this is a fact can be empiricaUy supported in numerous ways. For example, wiUingness-to-pay studies using "contingent evaluation" or "conjoint analysis" methods find substantial verbal expressions of support for sacrifice now to preserve the future ecology. Also, the substantial popularity of environmental preservation laws strongly suggests a general interest in future generations. Other evidence can be found in substantial bodies of fictional and reportorial literature, in the very substantial membership roUs of environmental action groups, and in substantial formal academic work on environmental ethics. 20 It might be countered that, since utiUty functions are heterogeneous, the preferences of stakeholders in some particular corporations might not happen to place any substantial value on the welfare of future generations. There are two objections to this argument. First, in a major corporation, most stakeholders are not personaUy known to managers of the corporation, so it is necessary to make decisions based on average utiUty functions, and average utility functions do in fact place a positive value on future generations. Second, stakeholder theory is rule-utilitarian, not goal-utiHtarian. The manager's prob lem is to formulate procedural rules that are Ukely to maximize utility on average, rather than to hyperop timize using aU the available information about specific cases. In addition we must assume that the stakeholders' utilities can increase even when they are benefitting from unethical acts, and they know it. That seems entirely within the realm of human possibility. Moreover, this problem cannot be resolved adequately by appealing to rule-utilitarianism. In principle, there could exist distinguishable classes of situations for which the welfare maximizing rules under stakeholder theory require the firm to act against common ethics. Perhaps a more Kantian approach could address this problem by requiring the stakeholders themselves to express only their higher ethical nature. It might also be argued that stakeholder theory simply does not fit comfortably into a utilitarian framework. While that may be true, no other frame work leads to equally crisp predictions. In the Kantian framework, for example, it is hard to determine exactly what concrete obligations might be imposed by the principle of equal respect for others. For example, if our generation exhausts certain scarce resources while leaving a bundle of new knowledge, but that knowledge turns out to be less useful than was anticipated, then future generations could be severely disadvantaged. It is certainly possible to leave an exces sively large bundle of new knowledge as a kind of insurance policy against this sort of risk. It does not seem possible however, to place great confidence in our ability to predict the level of risk. For example, how much and what kind of technological insurance policy can or should we leave against the possibility of a global ecological coUapse? It is not sufficient to argue that the best scientific information predicts no such coUapse, first, because science could be wrong, and we need to insure against that possibility; second, because in fact some scientists do predict a coUapse; third because that outcome is highly sensitive to future political decisions whose rationality</page><page sequence="20">336 David Burress cannot be guaranteed. I am not aware of economic models that have addressed this question seriously. Moreover, that is not the only hard question that can be raised. For a discussion of much more stringent definitions of sustainability that nevertheless attempt to appeal to scientific principles, see The Mundi Club (2002). 5 The Bergen Declaration (1990) summarizes the Pre cautionary Principal, in part, as: "where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of fuU scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation." According to the Commission of the European Com munities (2000), "this principle has been progressively consoUdated in international environmental law, and so it has since become a fuU-fledged and general principle of international law." For a critical response see Katz (2001). The Uterature denying these facts is also substantial, but that they are facts has been supported in statements by essentiaUy every relevant scientific organization. The leading summarization is by the Intergovernmental Panel on CUmate Change (2001). 27 Singer (2002, chapter 2) proposes equal per capita aUocations, on loosely argued utilitarian grounds. 28 E.g., the U.S. has recently spent under 0.1% of GDP on non-miUtary foreign aid (United Nations, 2001, p. 3), but over 5% of GDP on carbon-based fuels (U.S. Department of Energy, 2003). At present, substitutes for carbon-based fuels are considerably more expensive than carbon-based fuels. 29 As reflected for example, in the classic (and utiUtarian) legal decision on the tradeoff between potential damages and mitigation costs, given in Hand (1947): mitigation is required as a matter of equity only when expected benefits exceed expected costs. 30 Note in particular that income redistribution is somewhat difficult (though not impossible) to justify under a "one doUar, one vote" ethical standard. For that reason, the preceding arguments on fairness appeal to the poUtical economy of perceptions, rather than to the ethics of income redistribution. 31 This statement foUows conventional practice in gloss ing over two technical points. First, private net benefits are different kinds of things from social net benefits; to make them comparable, you need special assumptions on how both measured. Second, it is sufficient for welfare maximization that merely the signs of changes in private and social net benefits be equal. 2 Wh?e unwanted emissions do not constitute the only possible class of environmental threats, they constitute one of just two major classes. The second class consists in the over-exploitation of natural resources: animal and plant species that are driven to extinction, habitats that are destroyed, non-renewable resources that are used up, renewable resources that are exploited past the point of peak production. Problems of emission could formaUy be viewed as a subcategory of over-exploitation, in which opportunities for free disposal have been over-exploited; but in practice the regulatory methods for the two classes are entirely distinct. Emission is a putting into the environment, which needs to be regulated at the loci of production and consumption. Exploitation is a taking from the environment, which needs to be regulated at the loci of the environmental taking. This essay is concerned only with emissions. That is, I know of no substances for which a single molecule released into the pubHc environment consti tutes a nuisance. At the same time, even smaU numbers of unwanted molecules can be problematic within certain controUed high tech production processes. Also, very smaU numbers of certain viruses can constitute a threat. Arguments for global regulation of local poUution could stiU be made however, for example, on grounds of administrative efficiency, environmental justice, or equi table competitive advantage, but those issues are too compHcated to analyze here. 35 Also, there is a distinction between local concentration at the point of emission, and local concentration occurring elsewhere due to natural or artificial processes of accu mulation (e.g., concentrations of DDT in fat ceUs that increase up the food chain). To simpHfy the discussion I w?l abstract away from non-local accumulations. This point is both key and highly controversial. The discussion above is only a sketch of the fuU analysis that is needed. In particular, an effort should be made to place lower bounds on the probabilities of catastrophes of various sizes, based on cases already uncovered (such as ozone depletion and egg sheU thinning) in relation to numbers and mass of chemical species already released into the environment. It is also relevant that large numbers of artificial chemical species are now being found in human bodies (Environmental Working Group, 2003); see footnote 39 for a presumption that many of these species are hazardous. 37 There is also a separate question of the required level of proof in each case - for example, beyond a reasonable doubt, substantial persuasion, or preponderance of evi dence - which we w?l not analyze here. However, risk aversion combined with the explosively increasing num bers of novel substances being invented suggests that a strict standard wiU eventuaUy be needed. 38 About 75,000 chemicals are presently Hcensed for commercial use; over 2000 new synthetic chemicals are registered every year; the Environmental Protection Agency has talhed close to 10,000 chemical ingredients</page><page sequence="21">What Global Emission Regulations should Corporations Support? 337 in cosmetics, food and consumer products alone (Envi ronmental Working Group, 2003). However, the vast majority of chemicals synthesized in laboratories are never registered. Computerized indices Ust miUions of described entities; for example, GenomeNet (2002). Also, aU chemicals have multiple break-down products, most of which are never registered. Merck (2003) describes some 10,000 important chem ical entities and closely related classes. A hazmat guide by Patnaik (1998) describes some 1500 seriously hazardous chemicals. The ratio suggests that some 15% of described chemicals may be seriously hazardous. 40 There is also an ethical problem in imposing any given level of risk on a minority which doesn't agree to it. Certainly, a degree of involuntary risk imposition is inherent in the fact that we aU occupy the same world. StiU, there is a moral asymmetry between bearing involuntary risks and receiving voluntary net benefits, which suggests we should adopt an extra degree of risk aversion in determining our techno-social experiments, going beyond that degree of risk aversion held by the average person with regard to risks to him/her self. This approach can be viewed as an appUcation of the Precautionary Principle. It has actuaUy been written into law in embryonic form in CaUfornia (1986), which requires the governor to create a list of potentiaUy risky environmental chemicals that have not been shown to be safe. EarUer, the 1958 Delaney Clause had already taken the next step of preventing distribution of substances not shown to be safe, but it is limited to cancer risk in foods. E.g., for a very detailed description of numerous state and local R&amp;D subsidies ava?able in six Midwestern states, see chapter 3 of Buress, Oslund and Middle ton (2003). 4 NonfungibiUty impUes the social cost from socializa tion of risks is considerably higher than the social cost from providing direct subsidies of equivalent value. 44 That outcome is Ukely because the social cost of raising a doUar in revenue generaUy exceeds a doUar - i.e., there is an "excess burden" of taxation due to compUance costs, price distortions, etc. To the extent that government is reasonably efficient, the marginal social benefit of each program equals or exceeds the marginal social cost of raising revenues to support it (hence the "excess benefit" of services offsets the "excess burden" of taxes). For example, a generaUzed "nanotechnology" in which tiny self-repUcating agents accomplish practicaUy any task that can be broken down into smaU segments is a future technology sufficiently plausible to be discussed seriously in Scientific American (2000). Such technologies could arguably clean up any poUutant (other than self repUcating ones) at a low cost. Nor is setting a higher standard than mere "plausib?ity" a particularly useful device, as argued below. See for example, the 1964 Rand Delphi forecasts of technology reported by Cetron (1969, p. 93). A substantial majority of innovations predicted as Hkely to occur at various times between 1965 and 2000 have not happened yet, and most others happened much later than expected.
