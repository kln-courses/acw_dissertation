<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES A CONSIDERATION OF THE PROBLEMS PRESENTED BY PSALM II. 11 AND 12 ο: ONE of the most notorious cruxes of the Hebrew Bible is occasioned by the words in Ps. ii which form the end of verse 11 and the beginning of verse 12. The purpose of this paper is to review the problems and to offer a solution based partly upon etymological considerations advanced by certain mediaeval Jewish commentators and partly upon a new account of the way in which the text may be regarded as corrupt. The Hebrew text of verse 11 and of the beginning of verse 12 is as follows: עבךו את־להוה 3יךאה וגילו בךעדה : נ^קו־בר פן־יאנף The solemn exhortation to obedience, of which these words are a part, is addressed to the foreign kings and rulers who stand rebuked by Yahweh for having conspired to rebel against him and his anointed king. The R.V. renders the words cited: 'Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the son lest he be angry . . .' The particular phrases which present problems of interpretation are וגילו ברעדה (R.V. 'rejoice with trembling') and נשקו בר (R.V. 'kiss the son'). It will be convenient first to consider the two phrases separately. I.I. וגילו ברעדה A The R.V.'s translation of this phrase is substantially the same as that of the LXX (και άγαλλιάσθΐ αύτω iv τρόμω) and of Jerome (Iuxta Hebraeos: 'et exultate in tremore'), the only difference being that the former ver sion adds the personal pronoun in the dative case. All three1 translations accord with the view that וגילו is a Qal imperative form of the well known root גיל and that it bears here its usual meaning 'rejoice'. Two difficulties are, however, presented by this view; first, the mean ing 'rejoice' cannot be said to fit the context of a passage in which 1 It is probable that the Peshitta should be added to this list. The reading ْ/ْسْديْ حي ا ١٥٠٠ is best regarded as an internal (Syriac) corruption; thus an imperative (with suffix, or with preposition and suffix) of the verb ١٣ 'to rejoice' has become an Aphel imperative (with suffix) of ٠٠٠/ 'to seize . The verb אחז and the noun רעדה are associated in the Hebrew text of Ps. xlviii. 7 and Isa. xxxiii. 14; in the former case the Peshitta version makes use of the verb ٠٠٠/. It is possible that these phrases have influenced the Peshitta of Ps. ii. [Journal of Theological Studies, N.S., Vol. XXVII, Pt. 1, April 1976] J.T.S. I</page><page sequence="2">2 Α. Α. MACINTOSH foreign rulers are admonished to act obediently and, secondly, the phrase 'rejoice with trembling' appears to constitute a contradiction in terms.1 The latter difficulty was clearly perceived by the rabbinic commentators Rashi and ibn Ezra,2 and their comments are designed to resolve it. Thus, Rashi finds it necessary to expand the meaning of the phrase by reference to Isa. xxxiii. 14 (אחזה רעדה חנפים 'trembling hath surprised the godless ones'—R.V.); while terror seizes the godless, you (the righteous) will rejoice. Ibn Ezra's understanding of the phrase, on the other hand, suggests that trembling from fear of the Lord is a necessary part of true rejoicing or, conversely, that 'if you tremble from fear of the Lord, then you will rejoice'. Such explanations, which recur in a number of later commentaries, are as unconvincing as they are ingenious and, for the two reasons stated above, the translation which they seek to justify is to be rejected. Β A second explanation of the phrase וגילו ברעדה is offered by M. Dahood.3 Referring to the fact that modern lexicographers are unani mous in giving to the noun גיל in Dan. i. 10 meanings such as 'circle, age, Alter(sstufe)', he attempts to find occurrences of the same noun in Pss. xliii. 4 and cxxxix. 16 (but with the denotation 'life'), and verbal forms of the same root (with the sense 'to live') in Pss. xxii. 9 and ii. 11. Thus, גילו ברעדה is translated 'Live in trembling'. It is not possible here to review Dahood's theory in detail, for it is primarily concerned with the other texts cited above and, on the basis of its alleged suitability to them, it is applied without further argument to Ps. ii. 11. It is sufficient to observe that Dahood deals with the familiar root גיל to which reference has been made above, and that his theory, being open to a number of very serious objections,4 may be rejected. C A third interpretation of the phrase וגילו ברעדה is that advocated by the rabbinic authorities Saadya and ibn Janah.5 Saadya renders the 1 Cf. Η. Gunkel, Die Psalmen (4th edition, Gottingen, 1929). 2 For the text of Rashi and ibn Ezra's commentaries on the Psalms, see ed. J. Levensohn, מקראות גלולות vol. n (Warsaw, 1864). The two are dated in the eleventh to twelfth centuries. 3 M. Dahood, Psalms, i-iii (Garden City, 1966-70). 4 For example, he gives to the word in the Psalms meanings substantially different from that which it bears in Dan. i. 10; he misuses (and mistranslates) the LXX of Ps. xliii. 4; he does not merely repoint the text of Ps. cxxxix. 16 (as he claims to do), he emends it. 5 For ibn Janah (loth-nth centuries), see ed. A. Neubauer, The Book of Hebrew Roots (Oxford, 1875). For Saadya (9th-!oth centuries), see J. D. Kafilj</page><page sequence="3">THE PROBLEMS OF PSALM II. 11 AND 12 3 phrase (in Arabic) ואלהבוה ברעדה 'and fear him with trembling'. He argues that gyl is capable of bearing two meanings and compares with it the Arabic word trb1 which, he says, is used both in relation to fear and to joy (אלערב יסתעמלון אלטרב פי מוצ׳ע אלכ׳וף כמא יסתעמלונה פי מוצ׳ע אלסרוראלסרור). Ibn Janah, too, makes reference to Arabic trb\ he explains that the word denotes the physical agitation (^S^J-I) which is manifested both by the happy, exhilarated person (jj^~-JI) and also by the sad, afflicted person (Oj_&gt;J-l). Saadya and ibn Janah find in Hos. x. 5 another instance of the word gyl with a meaning akin to that which it bears in Ps. ii. 11, and Saadya finds a third instance in Job iii. 11. The three verses will be reviewed briefly in the light of this suggestion. 1. Hos. x. 5 The verse describes the discomfiture of the idol priests and people of Samaria as they witness the ruin of the Bethaven sanctuary. The phrase in question runs:2 וכמריו עליו יגילו. Since the verb יגילו is paralleled by יגולו ('they are in dread') and אבל (('its people) lament'), the view of Saadya and ibn Janah that יגילו depicts the terror or distress of the priests commends itself as appropriate in the context. The phrase may be rendered in English 'the priests show distress, lament over it.'3 2. Job iii. 22 The context of the verse is Job's argument that death is a happier state than life and that consequently the sufferer is glad to meet his death. The M.T. runs: : השמחים אלי־גיל ישישו כי ימצאו־קבר ν 11* : ן · · ·τ λ · ד.״ .... - The R.V. renders: 'Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave.' This interpretation of the phrase overlined as intensive is supported by reference to Hos. ix. 1 where virtually the same combination of words almost certainly bears this meaning. On the other hand, to interpret Job iii. 22 in this way precludes finding parallelism in the verse and suggests for it a meaning which is somewhat weak and repetitive. According to Saadya's commentary on Ps. ii. 1 r, the word גיל in this verse is to be interpreted by reference to Arabic trb; furthermore, in his (תהלים :תרגום ופירוש הגאון ר, סעדיה בן יוסף פיומי ,(ד. קאפזז (Jerusalem, 1966); for his translation of Job, see J. Derenbourg, R. Saadia ben Josef Al Fayyoumi, ν (Paris, 1900). 1 For this word, see E. W. Lane, Arab.-Engl. Lexicon, p. 1835. 2 The argument of this paper is unaffected by the textual amendments pro posed in W. Rudolph, Hosea (Stuttgart, 1966), pp. 195 f. and in L. H. Brooking ton, The Hebrew Text of the N.E.B. (London, 1973), p. 248. 3 Cf. the N.E.B. and Rudolph.</page><page sequence="4">4 Α. Α. MACINTOSH translation of the book of Job1 he makes use of this word and renders the verse: אלפרחין פי טרבהם ויסרון אדא וגדר אלקבר : In view of his comments on Ps. ii. 11 it is natural to suppose that he invested the phrase overlined with the meaning 'who rejoice in their distress'. It is suggested, therefore, that Saadya understood gyl in this verse to mean 'distress' and, more particularly, *mortal distress' and that the juxtaposition of גיל and השמחים constituted a Wortspiel. In the light of these considerations the verse as a whole may be translated: 'Which rejoice when they come to (mortal) distress, and are glad when they can find the grave.' If Saadya's interpretation has been correctly understood, it deserves serious consideration on the grounds that, without resort to emendation, it restores to the verse the parallelism and meaning long sought for it by commentators.2 3. Ps. ii. 11 (Hebrew text cited on p. 1 above) The interpretation of גיל proposed by Saadya and ibn Janah has the advantage that it gives to the verbal form וגילו a meaning which ade quately meets the needs of the context. It denotes the fearful or reveren tial attitude towards Yahweh and his king which the dissident rulers are exhorted to adopt. Moreover, it matches well the adjoining phrases עבדו יהוה ביראה 'serve the Lord with fear' and [נשקו [בר in the sense 'be (properly) ordered/order yourselves (properly)' discussed in Part II below. Philological Philological Considerations The interpretation of the word גיל in Ps. ii. 11 proposed by Saadya and ibn Janah is achieved, as has been shown, by analogy with the usage attested for the Arabic word trb. Saadya does not actually refer to the root gwl/gyl but it is natural to assume from the nature of his argument 1 See Derenbourg, p. 18; the Arabic is there translated 'qui, dans leur tristesse, se rejouissent et jubilent lorsqu'ils trouvent la tombe'. Kafih, p. 57 n., apparently understands Saadya to have been guilty of inconsistency and to have used trb in his translation of Job iii. 22 to express 'joy'. I have preferred to give Saadya the benefit of the doubt. 2 See, for example, H. Gratz, Emendationes in Plerosque V. T. Libros (Breslau, 1892), ad 10c.; this suggestion, despite the criticisms of it made by S. R. Driver and G. B. Gray in The Book of Job (Edinburgh, 1921), was adopted by Beer in B.H.3 and by the N.E.B. (see Brockington, p. 101).</page><page sequence="5">THE PROBLEMS OF PSALM II. 11 AND 12 5 that he links the word יגילו to it; certainly it is under the root gwl1 that ibn Janah makes his (similar) observations. On this view, then, the word gwl, like trb in Arabic, may be described as belonging to the ,Addad,Addad variety, i.e. it is one of those words (in Hebrew) which have opposite meanings.2 A number of later commentators, adopting this view of the semantic range of the Hebrew word gyl, seek to explain the matter by referring to the cognate Arabic word gal/gwl. Thus, G. C. Storr3 states that this Arabic word, like Hebrew dwr, denotes primarily 'orbe se volvere, gyrare se, circumire'. He suggests that, since this action may be used to express either joy or fear, Hebrew gyl, denoting 'exultare gaudio, choreas ducere' or 'vertigine corripi, trepidare', is likewise capable of expressing either joy or fear. This latter explanation is approved by Rosenmuller4 who notes in support of it the opinion that the Arabic noun gilan, derived from the root gal, has the meaning 'concussio, terror'. The theory as stated by Rosenmuller is set out by Gesenius5 and, consequently, it forms one element in B.-D.-B.'s description of the root gyl. B.-D.-B.'s philological note implies a more substantial community of meaning between Hebrew gyl and Arabic gal.6 It quotes (from Lane) the meanings for gal 'go around or about, be excited to levity etc.', thereby suggesting that behind Hebrew gyl 'rejoice' lies a similar semantic development, viz. (a) circular movement and (b) excitement to levity. Similarly, J. Reider's account of Ps. ii. 117 rests upon the view that Hebrew gyl denotes (a) bodily movement, (b) worship, and (c) rejoicing in the same way that Arabic gal means (a) 'moved in a circle' and (b)(b) 'danced'. Again, P. Humbert8 notes that gal in Arabic is used to denote dust as it swirls upwards and disappears and, consequently, he speculates that Hebrew gyl denotes (the cries of) the worshippers as they go around the sanctuary or twirl round like dervishes. While it is undoubtedly correct to regard Arabic gal as cognate with 1 Noldeke, Z.D.M.G. xxxvii (1883), p. 537, observes that there are no occurrences of the root spelt with a medial waw. 22 The phenomenon is carefully discussed by J. Barr in Comparative Philology and and the Text of the O.T. (Oxford, 1968), pp. 173 if.; he notes Saadya's inter pretation of Ps. ii. 11. נ Observationes ad analogiam et syntaxin Hebraicam pertinentes (Tubingen, !779). P· 38. 4 E. F. C.

Α. MACINTOSH Hebrew gyl,1 the particular theories listed above concerning the con tinuity of meaning between the two words are open to a number of objections. First, the oft-stated opinion that gal has a primary meaning 'turn oneself, sich umdrehen, move in a circle', etc., though possibly correct, is not certainly so; Lane (pp. 488 ff.)2 notes for the verb in the first theme the meanings 'went around or about', by which he clearly means not 'turning oneself around' but 'travel over a wide area'.3 In any case, for the claim that the word consequently came to mean 'choreas ducere' (Storr), 'danced' (Reider) there is no evidence what soever. Secondly, B.-D.-B.'s assertion that gal is capable of meaning 'be'be excited to levity' rests upon a highly selective and misleading use of Lane's lexicon. For gal in the first theme Lane gives 'became excited to lightness,lightness, levity and unsteadiness'. For the eighth theme he quotes the verb in the sentence 'The devils excited them to light ness,ness, or levity, and unsteadiness, so that they turned away from their religion religion to error; i.e. they carried them away and drove them (from their °י״°&lt; י ז׳ .׳.׳ religion).'religion).' Similarly, in the tenth theme: jJaULll 'The devils turned turned them from the right course, to error; fascinated them so that they turned turned with them'. This evidence may be held to indicate not the lightness of gaiety but rather the lightness and unsteadiness of mental confusion. Corroboration of this latter interpretation is found by con sidering the meanings of the derivative noun gawalanun given by Lane: " י ״ &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; the noun occurs in the phrases I Ojy■■ 'The first (lit. the revolving) &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ' &lt;·/ o&gt;· of anxieties' of anxieties' and jVy ·*Ji 'In his heart are revolving anxieties'. In the light of these considerations serious doubt must attend those theories which, by appeal to Arabic gal, claim for Hebrew gy/ a semantic development (a) turn oneself around, (b) be excited to levity/dance, (c)(c) rejoice. On the other hand these same considerations may be held to indicate an alternative and more plausible account of the root. Thus, the use of the Arabic word gal, and its derivative noun gawalanun to 1 Cf. Noldeke, op. cit., p. 537, E. Ben Yehuda, Thesaurus, ii (Jerusalem and Berlin, 1915), p. 757, and G. R. Driver in the Ndtscher Festschrift (Bonn, 1950), P- 51· 2 Cf. R. P. A. Dozy, Supplement aux dictionnaires arabes (Leiden, 1877), pp. 295 f. 3 It is true that he also gives the meaning 'He wheeled round or about'; but, as Lane makes clear, the meaning is associated specifically with battle and, usually, with defeat in battle. It is, therefore, quite possible to explain this meaning on the view that the word is often used to denote panic and disarray (see below).</page><page sequence="7">THE PROBLEMS OF PSALM II. 11 AND 12 7 denote mental or emotional turmoil together with the meaning 'aestua vit' ('be moved') attested for Syriac gwl1 suggest that the root gwl/gyl was used in a number of Semitic languages to denote emotional or mental excitement.2 On this view gyl 'to rejoice' is but one more mani festation of the same phenomenon. With this alternative account of the root, moreover, the view of Saadya and ibn Janah that Hebrew gyl is sometimes capable of the meaning 'to fear etc.' is entirely consistent; indeed, in the light of it their appeal to Arabic trb ('be moved to fear or joy') as a word with a parallel range of meanings is particularly appro priate. An alternative philological explanation of the root gyl, yet one which is similar in its nature and its conclusions, is that advanced by J. D. Michaelis.3 He maintains that although the root gyl is well attested in Hebrew with the meaning 'rejoice' there is no Arabic or Aramaic word with a similar meaning. Consequently he prefers to regard all forms of the word gyl as derived from a pe-yodh root cognate with Arabic wagila which, he says, properly means 'exsultare'/'to leap'.4 According to usage, however, wagila usually means 'to fear' while gyl in Hebrew denotes 'rejoice'. Ps. ii. 11 contains one of the few occurrences of Hebrew gyl with the meaning generally attested for its Arabic cognate. According to Michaelis's theory, therefore, the root wgljgyl also belongs to the 'Addad'Addad variety; one meaning is generally associated with the Arabic word wagila and the opposite with the Hebrew word gyl. Michaelis's theory is necessitated by his being unable satisfactorily to compare Hebrew gyl and Arabic gal/gwl. If, however, the account given above concerning the relationship between these words is accepted, then the premiss upon which Michaelis advanced this theory may be denied. Yet Michaelis's theory, although advanced on the basis of a faulty premiss, is worthy of serious consideration because it is unexceptionable from the point of view of comparative Semitic philology.5 In conclusion, the word gyl in Hebrew may be regarded as cognate 1 So Brockelmann, Lexicon Syriacum2 (Halle, 1928), p. 109. Payne Smith, Thesaurus,Thesaurus, i (Oxford, 1879), p. 678, gives 'commotus est'. In the Peshifta the word is used to translate נכמר1 רחמיו/נח1מי in Gen. xliii. 30 and Hos. xi. 8. 22 The further question whether a more basic and physical meaning (e.g. 'to turn oneself around') underlies what is actually attested for the root may be left open. 3 Supplementa ad Lexica Hebraica (Gottingen, 1792), p. 284. * * No such meaning is given by, e.g., Belot, Vocab. arab .-franfais (Beyrouth, 1896), 1896), Freytag, Lexicon Arab.-Latinum (Halle, 1830-5), or Wehr (ed. J. M. Cowan), Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic (Wiesbaden and London, 1971). 5 See G. R. Driver, Problems of the Hebrew Verbal System (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 7.</page><page sequence="8">Α. Α. MACINTOSH with both Arabic words gdllgwl and wgl, and with Syriac gwl.1 The two Arabic words constitute evidence that the root gwl/gyl belongs to the ,Addad class, and that the account of it suggested by Saadya's and ibn Janah's interpretation of Ps. ii. 11 is correct.2 נשקו פר .11 A The Peshitta alone of the ancient versions translates this phrase in the way adopted by the R.V. (Pesh. Us nn«׳; R.V. 'kiss the son'). Amongst the rabbinic commentators, however, the interpretation was favoured by ibn Ezra. He suggests that the particular command נשקו בר matches mention in Ps. ii. 2b of rebellion against Yahweh's anointed (משיחו) just as the command עבדו יהוה (R.V. 'Serve the Lord') in verse 11 matches mention in verse 2b of rebellion against Yahweh. Further, the word בד, taken to mean 'son' as in Prov. xxxi. 2, refers to the words of the decree of verse 7: בני אתה 'Thou art my son'. The phrase is therefore taken to indicate an instruction to pay homage to the king in a way 'known to this day in India' (viz. kissing a king in homage), and in a way similar in intention to that attested for the brothers of Solomon (viz. placing their hands under Solomon's hand—1 Chron. xxix. 24) and for slaves in relation to their masters (viz. placing their hands under the thigh—see Gen. xxiv. 2, 9 and xlvii. 29). Two objections to such interpretations of the phrase may be offered. First, the word בר in the sense 'son' is Aramaic rather than Hebrew and, while admittedly it is used in this sense in the late Hebrew of Prov. xxxi. 2, it is most unlikely that Ps. ii contains a solitary anomalous usage of this sort, and especially so when use is made of the word בן in an earlier verse (i.e. 7). Secondly, while the verb נשק with the meaning 'kiss' is well known and occurs frequently it is questionable whether, on the basis of it, reference can be found in Ps. ii to a particular act of homage otherwise attested outside ancient Israel rather than inside it.3 1 Cf. Driver's brief note in the Notscher Festschrift, p. St. Driver (somewhat tentatively) suggests that another instance of gyl in the sense 'to be afraid' may be detected in Ps. xviii. 16. 22 Kopf's view (op. cit.) that Hebrew gyl should be compared with Arabic gll rather than with gal is not developed sufficiently to merit consideration as an alternative theory. 5 The reference in 1 Sam. χ. 1 to Samuel's kissing of Saul does not of itself constitute evidence that kissing signified formal homage; the action may have indicated friendship and support.</page><page sequence="9">THE PROBLEMS OF PSALM II. 11 AND 12 9 A modified version of the interpretation A described above is that listed as a possibility by Qimhi.1 נשקו is given the meaning 'kiss' but בל is taken to have a meaning similar to בחיר 'elect, chosen one' and to refer to the king. Qimhi does not cite other instances where בר may have such a meaning but appeals simply to the phrase ברו לכם איש in ι Sam. xvii. 8. While it is plausible to suggest that ברו ?) ברו) in this latter verse is a form of the verb ברר with the sense 'select' that does not constitute sufficient evidence on which to posit the existence of a noun בר with the meaning 'select, chosen one'. In any case the objection raised above remains; 'kissing' is not attested as an act of homage to the king in ancient Israel and consequently Qimhi's sugges tion that the phrase may be interpreted to mean 'kiss the chosen one' is rejected. This latter objection also applies to a further suggestion of Qimhi that בר may have its usual sense 'pure, clean' (see below) and refer to the king who is, in the context of Ps. ii, the innocent party. Thus, the phrase as a whole would mean 'kiss the innocent one'. For the rest, the suggestion may be regarded as more ingenious than convincing. Β A second interpretation of the Hebrew phrase is implied by the trans lations of it offered by Aquila (καταφάήσαre εκλεκτως), Symmachus (προσκυνήσατε(προσκυνήσατε καθαρώς) and Jerome (Iuxta Hebraeos: 'adorate pure'). Here נשקו is again regarded as an imperative form of the verb נשק I 'to kiss', but the adjective בר 'pure, clean', derived from the root ברר 'purified, selected' (B.-D.-B., pp. 140 f.), is regarded as having an adverbial force. The phrase as a whole constitutes an instruction to pay homage (presumably to Yahweh) and in it the use of the verb נשק is metaphorical.2 On this interpretation, then, the advice given to the dissidents is that they should pay single-minded, pure homage (to Yahweh). This account of the phrase in question, although it fits the context tolerably well, has the grave disadvantage that the verb נשק I is not elsewhere attested with the extended or metaphorical sense 'to pay homage'.3 Furthermore, any attempt to invest the adjective בר with 1 For Qimhi (12th-13th centuries), see Sepher Tehillim im Pirush R. David QimhiQimhi (Isny, 1541). 2 Cf. Jerome in adv. Rufinum, i (Migne, P.L. xxiii. 432): 'verbum e verbo si interpreteris, deosculamini dicitur; quod ego nolens transferre putide, sensum magis secutus sum etc.' 3 At least not when used absolutely. ור1שק ידי לפי in Job xxxi. 27 probably means 'if I have raised my hand in homage' (see below); but to posit such a mean ing for נשקו in Ps. ii would require the assumption that the verb is used ellip tically (in the sense that both direct and indirect objects are omitted).</page><page sequence="10">10 Α. Α. MACINTOSH an adverbial sense cannot be supported by appeal to other similar instances and, consequently, it is doubtful whether the word בר can be held to qualify here the literal sense of the verb נשק I. The LXX render the phrase δράξασθε παιδείας, and with this the Targum's קבלו אולפנא may be compared. It is natural to suppose that that these translations imply that בר was read as the abstract noun בר 'cleanness, pureness', derived from the root ברר mentioned under Β above.1 Certainly it is under this root that ibn Janah refers to Ps. ii. 12, and for בר he compares the phrase כבר ידי ,according to the clean ness of my hands' in Ps. xviii. 21. That the word בר was capable of bearing the somewhat different meanings indicated by the LXX and Targum (viz. 'discipline, training, education') may just possibly be indicated by the evidence of the Arabic cognate words birrun and barratun;barratun; the former means 'filial piety' as well as 'good behaviour, innocence' and the latter denotes 'obedience'.2 Alternatively, the LXX and Targum may reflect the interpretation mentioned in B. Sanhedrin 92a;3 here Ps. ii. 12 is interpreted by reference to בר 'corn' in Prov. xi. 26, for אין בר אלא תורה 'there is no corn but Torah'.4 It is more difficult to assess the view taken of the verb נשקו by the LXX and Targum. Ibn Janah, however, in his consideration of the root נשק appears to take a similar view and he provides us with his reasons for doing so. Thus, although the verb usually means 'to kiss', he suggests that there is another closely related meaning which may be discerned in the phrases צדק ושלום נשקו (Ps. lxxxv. 11), and לפי ,Τ ותשק (Job χχχί. 27). In the former case נשקו means that righteousness and peace 'meet together' (Li!Ai'); Jn the latter case the phrase means 'my hand comes up and adheres to my mouth' (·cc.jVj ·U-. c~o), i.e., presumably, in a gesture of homage (to the sun or to the moon).5 Ibn Janah clearly thinks that this meaning is the fundamental one and 1 For the unlikely view that the LXX's iraibeias represents an internal (Greek) corruption of παί&amp;α, see Rosenmuller, p. 58. More plausible is Schleus ner, Lexicon in LXX, ii (Glasgow, 1822), p. 621. 22 Cf. Rosenmuller, quoting Muntinghe, p. 58. I have not had access to Muntinghe's work. 3 See L. Goldschmidt, Der Bab. Talmud, vii (Berlin, 1903), p. 390. 4 A third possibility has been suggested to me orally by J. A. Emerton; the LXX and the Targum may have been influenced in their interpretation of the phrase by the association of the word בר with מצ1ה in Ps. xix. 9: ΓΠΓΡ מצ1ת ברה. 5 The N.E.B. runs 'raised my hand in homage'. Driver and Gray, op. cit., p. 269, understand the phrase to mean that kisses were thrown in worship and for this they cite Sumerian and Babylonian parallels.</page><page sequence="11">THE PROBLEMS OF PSALM II. 11 AND 12 11 that the meaning ,to kiss' is derived from it; for, he says, kissing may be defined as the meeting of the lips of those who kiss each other. In any case it is from this fundamental meaning that he seeks to expound the phrase in Ps. ii. 12. נשקו בר, he says, means Ij-vyJ! which may be rendered 'Take upon yourselves piety, innocence'. In support of this interpretation ibn Janah refers to Gen. xli. 40 and to Pharaoh's words to Joseph: אתה תלדה על־ביתי ךעל־פיןז ישק כל־עמי He interprets the words overlined: dJ^.1 i.e. 'they will take upon themselves thy command and thy prohibition'. The translations of Ps. ii. 12 offered by the LXX, the Targum and ibn Janah have the merit that they fit well the context of a passage in which advice is given to dissident rulers: they should serve Yahweh with fear, they should tremble in fear of him and they should take upon them selves innocency. Further, to interpret בר as 'innocence' has the merit that it finds in the consonants concerned an occurrence of a noun clearly attested elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible. On the other hand, the interpretation of the verb נשקו which underlies all three translations is not so clearly attested and the question arises whether that interpreta tion will stand closer examination. In this connection ibn Janah's appeal to Gen. xli. 40 provides the most likely starting-point; for in this text, as in Ps. ii. 12, the word נשק clearly expresses an aspect of the deference for a ruler accorded him by his subjects. Further considera tion of the words of this verse suggests that it is specifically the notion of obedience that is meant, and to this interpretation the LXX and Vulgate clearly bear witness.1 It is, however, by reference to the Arabic word nasaqa, cognate with Hebrew נשק, that the meaning of the phrase becomes clear.2 nasaqa in the first theme denotes 'to place in order (pearls)' and 'to compose (a speech)'; in the second theme it means 'to arrange symmetrically, put (a matter) in order'.3 On the assumption, therefore, that Hebrew נשק was capable of bearing a similar meaning, the words of Gen. xli. 40 should be rendered as they are in fact rendered in the margin of the R.V.: 'Thou shalt be over my house and according unto thy word shall all my people be ordered.' With this interpretation Abu Sa'id in his Arabic version of the Samaritan 1 The LXX: cm τώ στόματί σου ύπακουσ€ται πας ό λαός μου. The Vulgate: 'ad tui oris imperium cunctus populus obediet'. 2 So ibn Bariin explicitly; for which, see below. B.-D.-B. note the theory (p. 676), but they show little regard for it and prefer to regard the text as corrupt. 3 See Freytag, p. 275 and Belot, p. 823.</page><page sequence="12">12 Α. Α. MACINTOSH Pentateuch1 is fully in accord; he renders: ^j» JS׳ . . and at thy word all my people shall order themselves/be set in order'. Further, ibn Bariin in his Book of Comparison2 declares that it is quite proper to translate the verb נשק as it occurs in Gen. xli. 40 by Arabic nasaqa, as indeed it is also in Ps. Ixxxv. 11. In the former case he renders ישק by 'they shall be set in order' and in the latter 1£~1'0נ '(righteousness and peace) were symmetrically arranged'. From a consideration of the evidence afforded by Gen. xli. 40 it is reasonable to conclude that the verb נשק in the Qal was capable of bearing, in addition to the meaning 'to kiss', the meaning 'to order oneself, to be set in order'. Certainly such a conclusion accords with the evidence furnished by the cognate Arabic word nasaqa. What, however, is not so clear is whether this conclusion accords with the theory advanced by ibn Janah. For, first, the meanings suggested for the word by ibn Janah (viz. 'to meet' or 'to take upon oneself') are not prima facie the same as those suggested by ibn Bariin and Abu Sa'id (viz. 'to order oneself, to be set in order'). Secondly, ibn Janah ascribes to the verb נשק a transitive force while ibn Bariin and Abu Sa'id regard it as being intransitive or passive in its meaning. On the other hand, it should be noted that ibn Janah considers Ps. ii. 12 before he considers Gen. xli. 40 and, because he takes the view that the former text contains a direct object (בר) for the imperative (נשקו), it is not unreasonable to suppose that he was obliged to adjust his translation accordingly. Further, when he proceeded to illustrate Ps. ii. 12 by reference to Gen. xli. 40 it is natural to suppose that he supplied ad sensurnsensurn the direct objects '(they will take upon themselves) thy command and prohibition' which are not represented in the Hebrew text of the verse; for to do so is to provide an intelligible if free interpretation of the phrase על פיך. On balance it is probable that the same understanding of the verb נשק underlies the two accounts of it described above; in relation to Ps. Ixxxv. 11 (צדק ושלום נשקו) there is little difference between the meanings 'arranged themselves symmetrically' (ibn Bariin) and 'met' (ibn Janah). Certainly it is equally plausible to derive the well attested meaning 'to kiss' from either. For the reasons stated above, it is likely that the translations of Gen. xli. 40 offered by ibn Bariin and Abu Sa'id are more literal than that offered by ibn Janah, and consequently it is reasonable to conclude that נשק, when used in the sense suggested by 1 See A. Kuenen, Liber Gen. secundum Arab. Pent. Sam. versionem Abu Sa:id (Leyden, 1854). 22 For ibn Barun (nth-12th centuries), see P. Wechter, Ibn Barun's Arabic Works on Hebrew Grammar and Lexicography (Philadelphia, 1964).</page><page sequence="13">THE PROBLEMS OF PSALM II. 11 AND 12 13 these authorities, has an intransitive (or passive) force. If this is the case, then immediately the question arises whether the word בר properly belongs to the text of Ps. ii. 12. III.III. The Text Most modern commentators resign as unequal the task of giving a satis factory meaning to the two phrases from Ps. ii discussed above, and consequently they resort to textual emendation. That they do so is understandable because, for the most part, the three words נשקו ,גילו, and בר are understood respectively to mean 'rejoice', 'kiss', and 'son', and when alternative meanings are mentioned they are deemed not sufficiently well attested to be commended.1 The conclusion therefore is reached that the text is corrupt and attempts to restore it by emenda tion are justified. Amongst a number of suggestions two particularly have been commonly adopted; first, that of A. Bertholet,2 who reads נשקר בךגל(י)ו בךעדה 'kiss his feet with trembling'. Secondly, G. R. Driver3 suggests the reading נשקו לגבור 'kiss the mighty one' (sc. the king), a reading which is adopted by the N.E.B. (see Brockington, p. 120). On the premiss that the text is corrupt both suggestions have the merit that in their reconstructions they make considerable use of the consonants of the M.T. On the other hand, considerable difficulty attaches to the view that the dissident rulers are exhorted to kiss the feet of Yahweh; to introduce so gross an anthropomorphism is implaus ible and the attempt to interpret the words metaphorically is unlikely. Further, if it be argued that Bertholet's reconstruction refers to the king, the difficulty arises that such a reference must be deduced from the third masculine singular suffix of the word רגליו to which there is no antecedent. Driver's suggestion is unconvincing because there is no evidence to indicate that a title גבור was used absolutely of the king.4 It has been argued above that it is reasonable to assume for both גילו and נשקו meanings which fit the context admirably. It was further argued on philological grounds that נשקו is most likely to be used absolutely in this verse, i.e. without an object. Are there then any textual considerations which may be advanced in support of the view that the letters בר are spurious and form no part of the text of the psalm ? 1 See, for example, B.-D.-B.'s treatment of נשק in Gen. xli. 40. 2 Z.A.W. xviii (1908), pp. 58 f. 3 See ed. Η. H. Rowley, Studies in O.T. Prophecy presented to Τ. H. Robinson (Edinburgh, 1950), pp. 55 ff. 4 Cf. J. Barr in The Heythrop Journal, xv (1974), p. 392.</page><page sequence="14">14 Α. Α. MACINTOSH Two such considerations may be suggested;1 first, the verbs עבדו and גילו are both followed by nouns construed with ב having adverbial force. Secondly, the initial consonants of ברעדה and of ביראה are, respectively, identical and very similar to the word בר. It is then not unreasonable to assume that בר represents a partial dittography of the word 2.ברעדה If this supposition is acceptable, the text of Ps. ii. 11 may be restored in either of two ways and translated accordingly: A: :עבדו את־יהוה ב.יךאה וגילו בךעךה ונשקו 'Serve the Lord with fear, shew fear with trembling and order yourselves (properly)/be (properly) governed'. Such a restoration has the disadvantage that it becomes necessary to insert a waw before the verb נשקו and, possibly, to omit the copulative wawwaw prefixed to the verb גילו. On the other hand, it has the advantage that the word order of the M.T. is substantially retained. B: :עבדו את־־יהוה ביראה נשקו ברעדה וגילו ΓΤ τ τ : · I : - ΛΤ : ·נ τ : ν : · 'Serve the Lord with fear, order yourselves/be governed in trembling and shew fear.' This restoration has the advantage that it preserves the copulative waw prefixed to the verb גילו, though it has the disadvantage that the word order differs more considerably from that of the M.T. Α. Α. Macintosh 1 It is here assumed that the Soph Pasuq is wrongly placed; that verse nb, beginning יאנף ID, constitutes a complete 3 : 3 line and that at least some of the letters נשק1בר belong to the previous line which is otherwise too short; cf. Gunkel and B.H.S. z I am indebted to J. A. Emerton for the suggestion, as also for criticisms of an earlier draft of this paper.</page></plain_text>
