<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME RECENT WORKS ON SPINOZA'S THOUGHT BY PAUL KASHAP The Seventies are witnessing an upsurge of interest in Spinoza. Numer- ous articles and collections of essays have been published. In 1972, Studies in Spinoza, edited by myself (the first collection ever of articles on Spinoza), came out. The next year, an Anchor Books edition on Spinoza was pub- lished. In 1975, all the essays that were originally published in the Monist issue dedicated to Spinoza (October 1971) were collected together, along with a few new ones, and became available in a volume edited by Maurice Mandelbaum and Eugene Freeman. In the same period, several interpretive books on Spinoza came on the market, and many more are in the process of being written. Gueroult's works are already acquiring a kind of legendary quality in Spinoza scholarship on both sides of the Atlantic. It is as though Spinoza finally were being "discovered," and philosophers interested particu- larly in the philosophies of mind, action, and freedom no longer can afford to ignore him or fail to take him into account. It is indeed heartening to see Spinoza enjoying such well-deserved recognition in the philosophical world. I shall take the recent books in reverse chronological order; the latest to come out was the one by Professor Henry Allison.1 It is intended pri- marily for the general reader and student, but it is hoped that it may also be of interest to the specialist and philosopher. In a little over two hundred pages Allison tries to present a "balanced picture" of Spinoza's thought as a whole, "one which will give the reader a sense of the breadth as well as the depth" of his philosophy. Consequently it does not pretend to offer either an intensive criticism or a detailed discussion of any particular aspect of Spinoza's thought. The book, however, does contain many suggestions and pointers which may prove to be of immediate relevance to contemporary philosophic concerns. The format of the book is fairly traditional. The first chapter gives a short account of Spinoza's life, background and the circumstances of the publication of his various writings. The second provides a brief but com- mendable account of the historical context of Spinoza's philosophy. It deals, among other things, with the relevance of Descartes and the new science to Spinoza's thought, as well as the significance of the geometrical form em- ployed by Spinoza in the presentation of his philosophy in Ethics. Chapters Three to Five, dealing respectively with God (the nature of substance, caus- ality, modes, and attributes), the human mind (including the mind-body relation and theory of knowledge), and bondage, virtue, and freedom (includ- ing an account of Spinoza's theory of action), form the central part of the 1Benedict De Spinoza, by Henry E. Allison (Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1975). 541</page><page sequence="2">542 PAUL KASHAP book, and take up about a hundred pages. The sixth chapter deals with Spinoza's political philosophy, while the last chapter presents his views on the nature of traditional religion and his method of interpreting the Bible. A short epilogue offers a sketch of the influence of the philosopher's views on subsequent thought. I shall confine my remarks to a few points in the central part of the book. Allison rightly observes that although much of the language that Spinoza uses in presenting his philosophy is reminiscent of the western re- ligious tradition, his overall point of view is quite different from, if not com- pletely antithetical to, that tradition. And Spinoza's God, who functions as the first principle of knowledge, and who is the object of intellectual love, has very little, if anything, in common with the God of the Judaeo-Christian tradition (p. 47). Spinoza's God has none of the anthropomorphic conno- tations of the God of traditional religion. In fact, for Spinoza, "God is the order of nature . . ." (p. 73) rather than a "being." Allison makes a further interesting point which deserves a clear recognition and perhaps was dis- cerned by Spinoza's contemporaries who charged him with atheism. It is generally claimed that Spinoza employed a form of the ontological argument in the first of the three "proofs" of God (which he gives in the Demonstra- tion to Prop. XI in Part I of Ethics). Allison points out (p. 66) that "it is not immediately clear either what, if anything, Spinoza has shown to exist necessarily, or what the assertion that something exists necessarily really means." And Allison argues that while Descartes uses the argument "to establish the existence of a being (God) about whom one was previously in doubt, Spinoza, on the other hand, has shown that substance, consisting of infinite attributes, and therefore encompassing all reality, possesses the pecu- liar characteristic of existing necessarily. Yet not only is Spinoza's substance not the sort of being about whose existence one can have doubts, but . . . it is not a being at all." Therefore, despite the many formal similarities be- tween Spinoza's argument and those of Descartes and Anselm, "Spinoza's argument leads to a radically different result than Descartes'. It does not prove that any being (God) exists, but that reality, as conceived under the category of substance, exists necessarily. Moreover, since necessary exist- ence means independent existence or being self-caused, and since this is applied to substance or reality as a whole rather than to a transcendent Deity, Spinoza's argument has the effect of denying the very creator God whose existence Descartes endeavored to establish." Spinoza's argument, there- fore, Allison concludes, "is in a very real sense, a demonstration of the non-existence of God!" This may well be the reason why he was branded an atheist. Generally speaking, Allison's analysis of Spinoza's concept of God/sub- stance, modes, attributes, and infinite modes is fairly straightforward, clear, and non-controversial. There are some points, however, which remain obscure. Granting that Spinoza's God has none of the anthropomorphic connotations that are characteristic of the Judaeo-Christian conception of God, Allison does not explain in what sense phrases such as "God's knowl- edge," "God's ideas," "ideas in God," "God's mind," and "intellect of God" are to be understood. While Allison claims that for Spinoza "human</page><page sequence="3">SOME RECENT WORKS ON SPINOZA'S THOUGHT 543 knowledge is similar in kind . . . to God's knowledge" (p. 60), and that there is no qualitative difference between a human or finite and a divine or infinite intellect (p. 82), Spinoza clearly maintains that the intellect of God differs from human intellect as the constellation "Dog" differs from the animal that barks. What, then, can be the grounds for maintaining the similarity between the kind of knowledge ascribed to God and man under these conditions? What precisely does it mean to say "God knows"? The question assumes greater importance in light of Allison's recognition that "the infinite intellect in Spinoza is not really an actual intellect at all, but the mere idea of the sum total of possible knowledge . . ." (p. 82). Again, when Spinoza says that the human mind is "part of the infinite intellect of God," Allison says this is "merely his characteristic way of mak- ing the point that the human mind is a member of, and participates in, the absolute or total system of thought" (p. 93). But what exactly does the phrase "total system of thought" signify? In what precise sense "thought" is used here remains unclear, despite Allison's explanation that each idea must be caused by another idea and the totality of ideas connected in this way forms a self-contained system which Allison identifies with Thought viewed as an attribute (p. 90). The question, then, is what exactly is to be understood by "ideas" in the phrase "totality of ideas"? In what sense could they be "conceptions of the mind"? Spinoza appears to be suggesting that the totality of the system of ideas is actually identical with ideas that can be said to be ideas in God's mind or in the absolutely infinite intellect. But the point is that if the infinite intellect itself is "not really an actual intellect at all" and is "the mere idea of the sum total of possible knowledge" as Allison maintains, then the sense in which it can be said to constitute the totality of the system of ideas or the total system of thought remains unintelligible. A similar difficulty arises when Allison observes (rightly) that for Spinoza "... There is an idea or correlate in the attribute of thought for everything that occurs in the physical world" (p. 95). Obviously these ideas remain in some sense "ideas" even when they are not actually conceptions of any individual mind. But it is difficult to understand, through Allison's account of "idea," in what sense they still remain ideas for Spinoza. It cannot be denied, it seems to me, that there is in Spinoza a sense of "idea" as a possible object of an individual mind, something thinkable even though not actually thought by any mind. It has essentia objectiva. It is also something real, and has essentia formalis. But this is not the sense of "idea" that can be understood solely by reference to his definition of an idea as a "conception of the mind which the mind forms because it is a thinking thing" (II Def. 3). It is simply not true, as Allison would have us believe, that Spinoza construes ideas solely as acts of thought and not as objects of thought. The evidence suggests that, depending on the context, he some- times speaks of them as acts of mind and at others as objects of thought. What is true in both instances is that they are equally modes of the attribute of Thought. Despite these critical remarks, Professor Allison's book is a welcome addition to Spinoza scholarship and will serve as an invaluable introduction to the philosopher's thought.</page><page sequence="4">544 PAUL KASHAP Spinoza on Knowing, Being and Freedom2 is a volume more for the specialist than the general reader. It contains an impressive collection of papers read at a Spinoza symposium organized in September 1973 by the International School of Philosophy in the Netherlands. The Director of the school, Dr. J. G. Van Der Bend (who also edited this collection) deserves congratulations for having arranged such a gathering. Nearly twenty Spi- noza scholars from both sides of the Atlantic came together to discuss their papers. One of the participants, Professor H. G. Hubbeling of the Uni- versity of Groningen, describes the atmosphere at the meetings in the follow- ing way. "We gathered in a circle and held our discussions in a Spinozistic, non-emotional way." His attention, he says, was drawn "to the fact that the way in which Spinoza is discussed now, differs very much from that of the twenties and thirties. In those days the scholars tried to defend their own philosophy with the help of Spinoza's authority. Now we have a free attitude towards Spinoza, although we admire him. Thus we are able to give a better evaluation of Spinoza's philosophy. At the conference nobody was a "Spino- zist," but . . . everybody agreed that the study of Spinoza is an inspiring source of philosophical knowledge. . . . The conference was a symptom of a new era in Spinoza scholarship." The contents of this precious volume bear witness to the truth of the above account. The participants in the sympo- sium are among the foremost living Spinoza scholars-Arne Naess, G. H. R. Parkinson, Guttorm Floistad, Errol Harris, Oskar Hansen, H. G. Hubbeling, Lee Rice, A. G. Wernham, Jon Wettleson, and others. Their contributions are examples of meticulous scholarship as well as deep sympathetic under- standing of the philosopher's thought. Yet each essay' is, in an important sense, independent of the others. There is not enough space here to con- sider any of them with the close attention they deserve. Suffice it to say that this collection of fifteen essays is a unique volume to be treasured by serious students of Spinoza throughout the world, a truly impressive collage of in- dividual issues, mostly in Spinoza's epistemology, considered with such care- ful detail as to create as close an image of Spinoza's mind as possible. It is to be hoped that this is not the last collection of its kind. Professor Errol Harris' Salvation from Despair3 is something altogether different. It is at once refreshingly new and yet familiar. It has all the virtues as well as the faults of scholarly works steeped in the tradition of a theological past. And yet it gives out sparks of originality in interpretation when considering Spinoza through glasses unblemished by the fog of con- vention and history. Such moments, though not rare, are few and far be- tween. Yet the work as a whole is a marvelous combination of scholarly scrupulousness and insight that goes deeper than a mere mastery of words written by Spinoza. The scope of Professor Harris' book is impressive, considering that it is only about three hundred pages long. It is not an "introduction" to Spinoza, but rather the author appears to assume that one has already been intro- duced to him. Nevertheless it could well serve as perhaps the most suitable 2 Edited by J. G. Van Der Bend (The Netherlands: Van Gorcum &amp; Co., 1974). 3 Salvation from Despair, A Reappraisal of Spinoza's Philosophy, (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1973).</page><page sequence="5">SOME RECENT WORKS ON SPINOZA'S THOUGHT 545 introduction to Spinoza short of reading the philosopher's own works. And since it is almost a Herculean task to go to Spinoza directly without the bene- fit of any aid whatsoever, Harris' book is an excellent companion to the study of Spinoza's texts. The book does not pretend to be a work of historical scholarship such as Wolfson's, nor of meticulous and detailed exposition such as Joachim's. It is a product of a lifelong fascination and deep study, and attempts to interpret Spinoza in order to show the relevance of his thought in the modern age. As Harris himself puts it in the Preface, his "purpose in this book is to re- interpret the philosophy of Spinoza to a new generation . . . in an effort to grasp and to make intelligible to others . . . in spite of numerous apparent and serious internal conflicts . . . what he really meant to say." There is virtually no criticism of Spinoza in this book. Perhaps rightly so, in light of Harris' goal. For criticism, if it is to be significant, must come after a genuine attempt has been made to understand the philosopher as he might have wished to be understood. Reconstruction of this kind is far more difficult and demanding than a mere critical exposition. Harris's at- tempt to reconstruct Spinoza's philosophy while staying close to the texts is admirable. But, as with any reinterpretation, there are difficulties. They arise mainly from a conflict, perhaps unavoidable, between two factors: on the one hand, there is the conscious attempt to maintain a stance of objectivity or impersonality in offering an interpretative analysis of a philosopher's thought from his own point of view; and on the other, there are the influ- ences in one's own intellectual and historical development which, inevitably, provide the point of view from which one looks at what a philosopher says in order to get at what he might have had in mind. This difficulty apart, I am inclined to think that the true greatness of a philosopher rests not so much on the accident of his saying what he does at the historical juncture when he says it (although I do not belittle this factor), but in the kind of timelessness of the content of his thought expressed through the statements he leaves behind as a legacy for reflective minds, and whose validity can be reconstructed in the conceptual vocabulary of succeeding generations over an indefinite period. The question that is perennially and philosophically significant is not "What was the importance of Spinoza's thought in the Sev- enteenth Century?" but "What is the significance of his thought for an in- definite 'now'?" And it is to Harris's credit that he seems to bring out the significance of Spinoza's thought in this latter sense. The book contains chapters on Spinoza's metaphysics, theory of knowl- edge, moral theory, political philosophy, philosophy of religion as well as, in my view, a brilliant last chapter on Spinoza's concept of human immortality, and it deserves an honored place amidst all library collections on Spinoza, public or private. Spinoza's Theory of Truth4 by Thomas Mark is the first book in English devoted to a full-length treatment of the subject, and contains several val- uable insights. 4 Spinoza's Theory of Truth, by Thomas Carson Mark (New York and London: Columbia University Press, 1972).</page><page sequence="6">546 PAUL KASHAP He rejects the notion (and quite rightly, in my view) of trying to make Spinoza into a defender of a coherence theory or of a correspondence theory, or of any other theory of truth. He attempts to present Spinoza's view on truth "as he [Spinoza] might wish it understood" (p. 4). In that respect this little book (128 pages) is admirable. The idealists, the realists, the pragmatists, all tend to seek confirmations for their own preconceived views in Spinoza; or in expressing their own views count on Spinoza as a philo- sophical ally. And Professor Mark justifiably contends that Spinoza does not fit into any of such neat categories as far as Spinoza's views on the character, definition, or nature and criterion of truth are concerned. Whether Mark's own thesis that Spinoza's views on the matter are to be properly understood "in relation to the much older theory of truth as being, or ontological truth" (p. 3), is the correct one, the reader will have to decide. There are five chapters in this book. The first consists of a short intro- duction. The second offers a brief account of Spinoza's concepts of sub- stance, attributes, modes, as well as of the relation between idea and ideatum. The last three, comprising the central part of the book, deal respectively with "The definition of truth, Truth and Substance, and Truth and Freedom." It is all very compact, and presupposes a good deal of understanding of Spi- noza's philosophy as presented in his Ethics and Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione [TdlE]. Nevertheless, the argument of the book is quite clearly expressed, and perhaps can be grasped without extensive first-hand knowledge of Spinoza's texts, though this naturally involves dangers of mis- understanding. Mark's analysis of the distinction between 'idea' and 'ideatum' is signifi- cant. In the Scholium to Proposition 7 of Ethics II Spinoza says ". .. a mode of extension and the idea of that mode are one and the same thing expressed in two different ways." The terms in this relation between idea and body are called by Spinoza idea and ideatum. An idea is a correlate in the attri- bute of thought of a mode of the attribute of Extension. An idea is some- thing "mental" and a mode of Extension something "physical." An idea and its physical correlate are taken by Spinoza to be two different "aspects" of the same thing. Thus Spinoza is generally understood to be maintaining that the ideatum correlative to every idea is necessarily a physical body. But this, Mark points out, is not always the case. The distinction between idea and ideatum does not always coincide with the distinction between Thought and Extension. "It would be more accurate to say that 'idea' and 'ideatum' refer to ideas and the things ideas are of. If we speak of ideatum as the object of an idea, we must not construe 'object' as applying to physical objects only. We can have an idea of a physical object, and when we do, the distinction between idea and ideatum coincides with the distinction be- tween Thought and Extension. But we can have ideas of things that are not physical objects; in particular we can have ideas of ideas. Thus an idea can have another idea as its ideatum, and when it does both the idea and its ideatum are modes of Thought" (p. 19). Furthermore, this distinction between idea and ideatum is similar to the distinction Spinoza draws in TdlE between essentia objectiva and essentia formalis. Essentia objectiva</page><page sequence="7">SOME RECENT WORKS ON SPINOZA'S THOUGHT 547 refers "to the being of a thing as it is stated or contained in an idea," and essentia formalis refers to "the thing in itself-that is, its status in relation to other things of the same kind. Thus the formal essence of a physical ob- ject is its existence as a physical object. But physical objects are not the only things that can be said to exist formally; an idea has relations with other ideas-it has a real status as an idea-and thus it too can be said to have formal being" (p. 20). Thus neither distinction (i.e., neither the one between idea and ideatum nor between essentia objectiva and essentia for- malis) always corresponds to the distinction between Thought and Extension. This is indeed an important insight. For in the absence of this distinction it becomes impossible, as Mark realizes, to understand how human beings can come to have any true ideas. I must, however, make two critical comments. Part of Mark's thesis is that truth in Spinoza is identical with Substance. And one of the passages he quotes (p. 76) in support of this thesis is from TdlE which says ".. . thought is said to be true, if it involves objectively the essence of any principle which has no cause, and is known through and in itself." Now it seems to me that, far from supporting Mark's thesis, it tends to prove quite the opposite. The quotation would be quite appropriate to establish the character of the thought involved in, for example, the truth of modus ponens (A D B). A:B. But it cannot be used to show the identity between truth and substance, unless modus ponens and all other truths having such char- acter are claimed to be identical with substance itself. For each distinct thought which is true in the sense that it involves objectively the essence of any principle which is self-dependent and hence is known through and in itself, will have to be true independently of any other true thought having the same character. That would mean that if each of such thoughts were to be identi- fied with Substance, there would be as many substances as there are true thoughts. And this would be regarded by Spinoza as absurd. Furthermore, granted that ". . . to have an adequate idea is to understand the essence of substance" (p. 77), an adequate idea, as an idea (in whatever sense of 'idea' one may take), is still a mode of the attribute of Thought. And although Spinoza does say that Substance and modes are all that exist, yet a mode of substance is not and cannot be identical with substance. Mark's attempt, therefore, to identify truth or true thought with substance, though interesting and ingenious, is really quite misleading and his arguments not as con- vincing as he would like to think. In another place Mark writes, "We can be certain that something is good, for the same sorts of reasons that we can be certain that an idea is true, but we cannot be certain that something is evil" (p. 112). I shall con- fine my remarks to the last part of the statement, for I find it rather odd. Surely to know that something is evil is to have true knowledge of evil and thus to increase the mind's power of action. For certain knowledge that something is conducive to the generation of passive emotions and thus to the decrease in the power of the mind is itself an instance of true knowledge of an emotion as passive rather than active. The confusion involved in maintaining that for Spinoza "We cannot be certain that something is evil" in face of the fact that Spinoza clearly holds that passive emotions are,</page><page sequence="8">548 PAUL KASHAP insofar as they decrease the body's power of action, evil, arises perhaps from mistakenly identifying "inadequate knowledge" with "false knowledge." Besides, Spinoza repeatedly speaks of "true knowledge of good and evil." He does not surely mean by this "true knowledge only of good and not of evil." Mark consequently is forced to say that "the expression 'true knowl- edge of good and evil' is not strictly acceptable" (p. 112). But the point is that the fact that Mark's interpretation of Spinoza does not permit him to accept it does not entail that Spinoza himself does not accept it. These comments do not do full justice to the contents of Mark's book, which is not only thought-provoking but offers an original analysis of Spi- noza's conception of truth. Each one of these books, then, provides a glimpse of the core of Spinoza's philosophy without exhausting other possibilities. For as Hampshire ob- served in his lecture to the British Academy, one can return to Spinoza "again and again without ever being sure that one has penetrated to the centre of his intentions."
