<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cyril Bailey; Phases in the Reli gion of Ancient Rome. Berke ley, Cal. : University of California Press; Oxford: University Press. IX, 340 S. 4'$; 15 Sh. (Sather Classical Lectures. 10.) This book has no new thesis to prove, but sets out to state, in a clear and eminently readable manner, remi niscent of the late W. Warde Fowler, the stages by which Roman religion grew from its earliest known forms to the beliefs and practices in vogue under the later Empire. Its merit lies in the excellence of its exposition and comment, together with the good sense shown throughout and the sympa thetic understanding which the lec turer brings to his subject. Its one serious demerit is that the author's knowledge of the material, or rather of the latest critical work on the ma terial, is not perfect. Following lines similar to, but not identical with those laid down by Frazer, B. sets out (Chap. 1) to distinguish religious rites proper, i. e., those in which some power outside of man, and normally superior to him, is approached, from those which, although more or less akin to religion, involve an attitude of mind not strictly religious, since they seek to affect or even control a power (mana, orenda) resident in natural and other objects. B. instances the ritual of termini and the growth therefrom of a deus Terminus. Next B. proceeds to describe the worship of spirits (nu mina), rightly beginning with a chapter on the beliefs involved in such worship and only then going on to speak of the ritual used. From these vaguer figures (such as Vesta, the Penates, the Manes) he passes to the more august names of the gods, native and foreign, and the coming of anthropomorphism, the introduction of Greek cults and the growth of the elaborate State ceremonial. Having thus brought his story down to the Augustan revival, he next turns to the Oriental worships and the reason for their popularity, the philosophies which took their place, or supplemented them, among the more intelligent, and finally the mass of ?syncretism and superstition? (so his last chapter is called) which marks the decline of ancient civili sation. It is at once obvious that a work which in 277 pages, exclusive of the notes printed at the end, traces the subject from the Calendar of Numa, or even earlier, to Saloustios' de dis et mundo cannot and does not pretend to give a detailed account of the facts, for most of which indeed the reader is referred to well-known and stan dard treatises, English and German. Here, as already mentioned, lies a defect of the book, for the treatises referred to all belong to the generation just passed or passing, for which the final authority was, generally spea king, Wissowa's ?Religion und Kultus</page><page sequence="2">Nachrichten und Vorlagen 443 der R?mer?, with Warde Fowler's ?Religious Experience of the Roman People? as its chief English commen tary. B. does not seem quite to realise to how large an extent this orthodoxy has been challenged by a group of writers among whom Altheim at pre sent takes a leading place. It is indeed open to him to deny the soundness of the criticisms levelled against the older school; but he is hardly justified in omitting all mention of the newer writers so completely as to say, for instance, that Saturnus-Saeturnus is ?undoubtedly? connected with the vb. ser ere (55), or to assume without dis cussion Wissowa's interpretation of di indigetes (115). A minor shortcoming is a certain weakness in philology; the derivation of flamen from flare is at least highly contestable (155); it is neither certain nor even very likely (84) that made in made esto is voc. (such a use occurs nowhere outside of Imperial poetry); and a few more instances of this defect might be given, together with certain inadequacies in the chapter dealing with superstitions. But these, taken all together, do not affect a tenth part of the whole book, and are compensated by several ex cellent pieces of detailed exposition and discussion (as 102?105, on the Lares; 222?225, on the Epicurean attitude towards the gods). It remains to ask whether the picture drawn is on the whole, apart from these con testable points, a true and accurate one. That it is so is the feeling of the reviewer, after a careful examination. At the outset, the vague religi?, ? tabu, ? prevalent in so many obser vances, notably in the ritual sur rounding the greater flamines, and the practice of various forms of active magic, are well described, though per haps with a shade too little stress on their emotional side, and the whole relation of such ideas and feelings to Roman worship in general excellently summed up (34); ?religio was there always, but, as it takes higher forms, magic sinks into the background and becomes superstition. Concerning spi rits, he suggests (40) as the earliest and most primitive phase the idea that numen adest in some particular spot; this he distinguishes rightly (44) from what it is often confused with, a "wor ship of natural forces as such, though he admits a certain element of nature worship exemplified in Juppiter and Tellus (45; he specifically excludes sunworship, 44, where some dis cussion of Sol Indiges would not have been out of place). As regards the masculine and feminine spirits, he is emphatically, and in the reviewer's view rightly, of the opinion that to suppose them credited with sex in any real sense is ?a complete negation of the fundamental principle of Roman animism? (66). Regarding worship, while he has little to say that is new, he at least states with praiseworthy clearness the reason why the old rites ceased to have any meaning, in so many cases, for the average Roman of historical times; being in their origin rustic, they were out of place in the city (86, cf. 146 foil.). Hence ?an un intelligent conservatism? (149) and a consequent fossilising of what had had in it elements of a really spiritual faith. Of his account of the coming of Greek, and later of Oriental cults, little need be said; on this often-traversed ground he does no more than repeat correctly and well what has been said by Cu mont and others. When he comes to philosophy, although he disclaims any intention to discuss the Greek schools, or even competence to do so (215), he speaks as an expert regarding Lu cretius, and makes a highly plausible suggestion (220) that as his mind was slightly abnormal, he so exaggerated others' fear of death (which indeed does not seem at that date to have been unusually acute) that it became an obsession with him. Finally, he</page><page sequence="3">444 Gnomon 1933 devotes the last few pages to an in teresting evaluation of Rome's contri bution to the religious development of humanity at large. This he rates somewhat higher than is usually done : ?Nor were the Romans mere trans mitters (sc., of Greek thought), what they adopted, they in some degree transmuted . . . The steady main tenance of Greek ideals, and the sway of Greek thought over the Church of the Middle Ages, was due to its assi milation by the Roman people.? St. Andrews H. J. Rose</page></plain_text>
