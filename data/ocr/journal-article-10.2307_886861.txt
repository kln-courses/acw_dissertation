The date of 1618/20 proposed in the catalogue, seems rather too early, especially as the Blessed Salvatore of Hortn at Novi Ligure (Genoa cat. no. 36), with which it shows the greatest affinity, can be dated to c. 1625. From here on, that is to say in the second part of the beautiful gallery in which the exhibition was hung, the chronological order became somewhat confused, showing ,8 . . . . some ot t ze same lnconslstencles evlc Went ln the Genoese show. The sequence opens with a Christ's sharge to St Peter from a private collection (no. 18) which is hung opposite a canvas of the same subject from the Elve- hjem Museum, Madison (no.27), making it easy to verify (as it was not in Genoa) that they are indeed close in style, though this is denied in the catalogue which places them at least fifteen years apart. It also should be noted that the St La7RJrence distributing the ealth of the church from St Louis (no.l9; Fig. l 1 1), is a superb picture, of much high- cr quality than the two versions shown at Genoa, especially in the splendid rendition of gold and silver objects in the foreground: I would have thought a date of c. 1625 more plausible than that suggested in the cata- logue. The presentation of Strozzi in this his greatest period becomes a little diluted by paintings which belong elsewhere. The beautiful Healing of Tobit from Cleveland (no. 14) and the interesting Cook from a pri- vate collection (no. 15; Fig. l 12), while auto- graph, cannot be from the mid-1620s, but must surely date from the Venetian period as the formal elements and palette strongly suggest. Those who remain unconvinced should remind themselves of the circum- stances of Strozzi's flight to Venice, which rule out the possibility, put forward in the catalogue: that he could have taken paint- ings with him, especially not one as large as the Cook. It rernains to mention only the Baltimore Museum of Art's StAtolloninl (no.20), proba- bly intended as part of a series, which echoes Simon Vouet more than Caravag- gio, and the only weak point in the section dealing with Strozzi's Venetian activity, the Ehree musiciclns from Detroit (no.23). The catalogue,3 ably compiled at great speed by Joaneath Spicer, contains an introduction by her on the politics of images in the Counter Reformation, a biographical text by Peter M. Lukehart and entries by these two and Martha Lucy. If it relies somewhat too heavily on the Genoese cata- logue (occasionally misinterpreted), it suc- ceeds, as a whole, in making Strozzi known and in explaining his religious themes to a public unfamiliar with Catholic iconogra- phy PIERO BOCCARDO Galleria di Palazzo Rosso, Genoa lSee the review by Stephane Loire in theJuly issue, p.47 7 2See M.

New York Sculpture in New York Looking at the almost fifty works by such nineteenth-century figures as Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Erastus Dow Palrner in the exhibition of American Relzef Sculpture at the Metropolitan Museum of Art(closed 16th October), Henry James, inevitably, came to mind. Many of these sculptures portray artists and collectors who might come straight from his novels. Such idealised subjects as Herbert Adams's exquisite carved Singing boys (1894; Fig. 1 16), which looks like an Agostino di Duccio carving, have much in common with the early renaissance Italian art collected by well-travelled Americans ofJames's genera- tion. Made around the time when the Met- ropolitan Museum itself was created, these works show an immature American culture turning to Europe for its artistic modelsr imitating a sculptural tradition which now seems incredibly distant. How self-confident, by contrast, wasJohn F. Kennedy's early 1960s America. Dan Flavin's fluorescent light works from the late 1960s and early 1970s at the Dia Center for the Arts (to 23rdJune 1996), and those from the early 1 960s to the late 1 980s at the Guggenheim Museum Soho (closed 30th November) are exuberant and expan- sive. When he found that ordinary com- mercial fixtures could be used to create sculpture, he made one great discovery, the basis for his entire career Flavin can subdi- vide the room7 set his lights on the floor or mount them on the vvall or, in the corner- filling Untitled (in honor of Leo at the 30th anniversary of his gallery) (197 1; Fig. l 15), pro- ject intense colour behind the supporting frame, creating the appearance of a curi- ousily inaccessible painting.

In 1963, the twenty-year old David Rabinowitch, working in isolation in Ontario, conceived his breakthrough works. Exactly a decade younger than Flavin, he moved more quickly, and soon developed in more unpredictable ways. The majestic Box trough assemblczge (Fig. 1 17) shown in the main gallery of Peter Blum (closed 4th November), is a genuine master- piece, a fully accomplished work which sup- plements in unexpected ways our image of 1 960s sculpture. Reacting against the anthropomorphism of David Smith, whom he admired deeply, and inspired by what * * c X . may seem a more surprlslng source, R1S close reading of Hume and Spinoza, Rabi- nowitch used prefabricated units of l 6- gauge steel sheets to create large assemblages. Unlike the 1960s works of his American peers, Carl Andre and Donald Judd, these composed floor pieces, which anticipate the visual logic of Rabinowitch's Metrical constructions of the 1 970s, offer a dis- tinctly different visual experience from each physically accessible vantage point. Reject- ing both Flavin's theatrical appeal to a mobile spectator and the illusionism of Anthony Caro's art, Rabinowitch here pre- pared the way for both his later concern with Marcel Duchamp's ready mades, and the more explicit acknowledgment of gravi- ty in his own vertically-oriented Gravitational vefiPcles of 1965. Even without such knowl- edge of his long career, the sympathetic viewer of the drawings at the gallery entrance, and the smaller Box trough assem- blclge upstairs could not but sense that the young Rabinowitch had both a highly com- plex vision, and the skills needed to extend the traditions of his art in a radical way. Kiki Smith, whose show at Pace Wildenstein (closed 21st October) includ- ed sculpted dead crows on the floor, animal 1 17. Box trough assemblage, by David Rabinowitch. 1963.

Her 1980s sensibility, very well presented in the cata- logue containing images of her work (along with a temporary tattoo permitting the reader to sculpt her or his own body with a Smith drawing), finds pleasure in bringing together very different things.l She makes figurative and non-figurative pieces, sculp- tures of human forms and also animals and domestic objects using bronze, fibreglass, hand-blovvn glass, horse hair, paperr string, and wax. What then unifies this assemblage of artefacts is not some overriding master plan, but sympathy for ordinary things, respect for the vulnerability of such sculp- tural subjects, and her tough capacity to be self-critical. Americans of the l990s, unlike their precursors of the 1960s) are aware of the dangers of public spaces, and knowl- edgeable about the limits of national power. Smith's art teaches us that it is still possible to have aesthetic pleasure in that odd exhil- aration which comes from conjunctions of individually mysterious things. Because an exhibition of sculpture, much more so than a show of painting, implies a real space, an implicitly public place which can be shared, sculpture's development is naturally discussed in terms of what it reveals about our collective history. Moving within sculpture's spaces, we find documen- tation of our changing conceptions of self- hood. What aesthete, thrilled by the Cornaro Chapel, does not then reflect on the ideals of Seicento Roman Catholicism? Who, appreciating the beauty and sobering truth of Maya Linns Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, does not think again about the struggles of that era? To see and evaluate these sculptures by Herbert Adams, Flavinn Rabinowitch and Smith properly and critically requires that we pon- der the larger changes taking place within North American political and artistic cul- ture during the past century.
