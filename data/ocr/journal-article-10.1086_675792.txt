         <p>In 1985, the Getty Research Institute (GRI) acquired an album containing a series of illustrations of the Apocalypse created by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (German, 1880–1938) as part of the archive of German lawyer and art expert Wilhelm Arntz.<sup>1</sup> The artist’s engagement with this biblical topic has so far not been given sufficient attention.<sup>2</sup> No documents exist that reveal the artist’s intention to illustrate the Revelation of Saint John or explain the circumstances under which he accomplished these drawings. However, many elements can be brought forward to reconstruct the historical and biographical context in which they were created. On the one hand, the illustrations relate to the political and intellectual disruptions prior to and during World War I, but, on the other hand, they seem to be artistic expressions of the artist’s personal psychological situation.</p>
         <p>Executed in great detail, the small-scale works were drawn on the backs of cigarette packs from various brands.<sup>3</sup> It is clearly visible that the artist first outlined the compositions with pencil before coloring them carefully with watercolors. The twelve cardboards were then pasted into an album bound in brown leather, but it is not clear whether Kirchner himself executed this step. The sketches were obviously dear to him as miniature artworks because he dedicated an entire album to them, leaving the remaining pages empty. Only one annotation provides information about the drawings—a note on the first page, handwritten by the artist: “Diese Entwürfe zur Apokalypse sind aus dem Jahre 1917 E L Kirchner” (These sketches of the Apocalypse date to the year 1917 E L Kirchner). It is also unknown when or where Kirchner purchased the album, or whether he received it as a gift. It forms, in any case, an exception in the body of the artist’s more than 180 known sketchbooks, which are usually bound in either waxed cloth or paper.<sup>4</sup> A small stamp on the front cover reading “Lucie Weill” (a French bookbinder), together with the unusual appearance, suggest that the binding has been commissioned by someone else, probably the physician Frédéric Bauer, who received the drawings from Kirchner. The seemingly clipped page numbering and a missing estate stamp indicate that the album might have been altered further once it reached the art market.<sup>5</sup> The annotation indicates that Kirchner wanted to register the sketches’ year of origin; considering the even handwriting, which contradicts with the scrawly letters that usually date to the years around 1917, the pasting may have been done later, possibly even much later, than their actual creation.</p>
         <p>The date of 1917 must be treated with caution, as the artist is known to have dated his works rather arbitrarily and even to have occasionally manipulated and antedated them. In the present case, however, the supports—the cigarette packs from the brand Sportcigaretten—provide verification. In 1919, the manufacturing company K. u. k. Österreichische Tabakregie was renamed Österreichische Tabakregie. Because the packs Kirchner used for the drawings still feature the affix “K. u. k.,” they must predate the name change. The accuracy of the date is also supported by the fact that Kirchner had no art supplies during his first weeks at the Bellevue Sanatorium in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland, where he lived for several months in 1917.<sup>6</sup> It was Kirchner’s habit to always carry a sketchbook and not let a single day pass without drawing. Using the cigarette packs might have been the only way to follow his creative impetus when he was deprived of traditional art supplies. A year later, in 1918, while in Davos, Switzerland, Kirchner continued his work on the Apocalypse and made two woodcuts about the topic.<sup>7</sup> The woodcuts clearly refer to the drawings, suggesting that Kirchner may have intended to illustrate the entirety of the book of the Apocalypse for a special edition.<sup>8</sup> There is no documentary evidence that Kirchner got a commission to do so. The very precise illustrations, which allow the viewer to easily identify the biblical passages illustrated by the artist, suggest that he must have read the text of the Apocalypse carefully and, impressed by the visionary power of this text, decided to execute the drawings at hand and later the woodcuts.</p>

         <p>The circumstances of Kirchner’s life around 1917 reveal why he may have been fascinated by this biblical text. He was in a desperate situation. His living conditions had worsened since the outbreak of World War I and were characterized by a series of physical and psychological crises. Although Kirchner had volunteered for military service in the spring of 1915, his mental and physical health worsened so rapidly and intensely that he was discharged as “unfit for service” only a few months later.<sup>9</sup> The anxiety of being drafted again and sent to the front remained Kirchner’s constant companion and drove him to the brink of a nervous breakdown. Adding to his desperate state was the loss of two of his closest friends, Hugo Biallowon, who died in combat in 1916, as well as Botho Graef, his patron and fatherly adviser, who died of a heart attack the following year. To numb his war neurosis and depression, the extremely sensitive artist increasingly consumed alcohol and drugs, which in turn ruined his health. A series of stays in various sanatoria (the Sanatorium Dr. Kohnstamm in Königstein im Taunus, Germany, and the Sanatorium Dr. Edel in Berlin) in the years 1915 and 1916 did not have the desired effect on Kirchner’s health. Thus, in early 1917, friends of the artist, in a desperate attempt to help, decided to organize a trip to Switzerland, hoping that Kirchner would recover in the solitude of the mountains of Davos and under the care of Dr. Lucius Spengler.<sup>10</sup> However, as the frequent arrivals and departures from the sanatoria show, Kirchner was not a patient person and decided to travel back to Berlin less than a month after his arrival, although he had hardly convalesced. To make matters worse, he was involved in two accidents on his way to Berlin, which led to extreme pain in both hands and feet and culminated in their temporary paralysis. This rendered the artist, who had set for himself the imperative to “draw [himself] into a frenzy, just draw,”<sup>11</sup> at times completely unable to work, thus adding to his miserable condition. Deeply impressed with the mountains and rural life in the Alps, Kirchner set out to Switzerland again in May 1917 and this time spent the entire summer on the Stafelalp above Davos before his health deteriorated so badly that he decided to move into the Bellevue Sanatorium (directed by Dr. Ludwig Binswanger) in September. He stayed there until July of the following year. Although handicapped in many ways during this period of his life, the artist was surprisingly productive in drawing and even accomplished several impressive woodcuts.<sup>12</sup> In particular, a series of portraits and self-portraits represents the intense and strained moral and physical condition of his life during this period and depict his own, partly self-inflicted, suffering with an unsettling directness.<sup>13</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Kirchner’s crisis, however, reflects the overall anxiety and uncertainty that characterized the beginning of the twentieth century in Europe. The collapse of the Wilhelminian socioeconomic order, the changes brought about by the industrialization, and of course the ensuing horrors of World War I stoked fears of the future and resulted in a general existential angst. Before the war, writers and artists had referred to the biblical Apocalypse to express their feelings of a necessary renewal of political and social life. By the time Kirchner started working on his Apocalypse drawings, it had become clear that any hope for a positive transformation of society and living conditions that the war might have promised would remain unfulfilled. It is thus precisely the ambiguity of hope and destruction conveyed by the biblical narrative that accounts for the attraction of this holy book for the artist.</p>

         <title>III</title>
         <p>We have to interpret the Apocalypse illustrations in this historical and especially biographical context. The first drawing in the album, which cannot be directly related to the biblical text of the Apocalypse, represents a self-portrait with a skeletal figure symbolizing Death (fig. 1; drawing 1). Kirchner depicts himself frontally, hands folded in a prayerlike gesture under the chin. Death appears behind him to the viewer’s left and rests a hand on the artist’s shoulder. The drawing characterizes the artist’s life in desperation and directly and unambiguously foregrounds his fear of and perceived proximity to his own end. Kirchner confined the drawing’s colored wash to a palette of pale blue, blue-green, and yellow, the latter restricted to the areas of the artist’s face and hands. The color, together with the overly slim and haggard face and general physique, sound a ghostly note and give the impression of an already dead body. A sign of life is registered only by the piercing yet forlorn expression of the eyes, adding to the overall hopelessness that dominates the artist’s face. The small, staring dots of the artist’s eyes are contrasted by the large, empty sockets of the skeleton lurking closely behind the artist’s right shoulder. A few transparent highlights underscore the threatening character of Death. The depiction captures the moment of impending death. The skeleton’s touch seems to draw the artist into the realm of death, signifying the brevity of earthly life. Although the imprecisely outlined human face is not very individualized, Kirchner’s biographical situation and the image’s iconographic details allow for an interpretation as a self-portrait. This understanding of the image is reinforced by the similarity to a contemporaneous self-portrait by Kirchner, a woodcut titled <italic>Head of a Sick Man (Self-Portrait)</italic> from 1918 (fig. 2), in which the face bears a strong resemblance and comparably haggard expression. Another woodcut, <italic>Self-Portrait with Dancing Death</italic> from 1918, revisits the subject of a self-portrait with Death and shows a fragmented body with a large head and a skeleton dancing on the artist’s shoulder.<sup>14</sup>

         <p>The subject of artist and death was, especially around 1900, a recurrent theme of the visual arts. The Swiss-German painter Arnold Böcklin’s <italic>Self-Portrait with Death Playing the Fiddle</italic> from 1872 (fig. 3) was inspired by a portrait of Sir Bryan Tuke (in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich), which, in Kirchner’s time, was still attributed to Hans Holbein the Younger and features Death behind the protagonist’s left shoulder. Only a few years later, in 1875, Hans Thoma painted himself in a similar manner, with the skeletal Death lurking in the background: <italic>Self-Portrait with Amor and Death</italic> (in the Staatliche Kunsthalle, Karlsruhe). In 1896, Lovis Corinth’s <italic>Self-Portrait with Skeleton</italic> (in the Staatliche Galerie im Lenbachhaus, Munich) followed. Corinth continued his engagement with the topic and created a series of six related etchings, <italic>Totentanz</italic> (Dance of Death), in 1922 (published by Euphorion Verlag, Berlin, and currently held in various locations).<fig id="fg3" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>The various depictions of the subject are remarkably different in composition and expression, yet all of them are connected by the notion of <italic>memento mori</italic>, which is ever-present to the artist when creating an artwork that will outlive him. In some of the paintings, such as Böcklin’s, Death assumes the role of a muse and seems to inspire the painter in his work. Kirchner’s sketch, however, is far from that idea. The artist is not even equipped with art supplies. Death places a hand on the shoulder of the seriously ill Kirchner, who seems to have surrendered to his fate.</p>

         <p>The subsequent sketches of the Apocalypse album clearly do not follow the order of Saint John’s narrative. The first two works relate to Apocalypse, chapters 4 and 5, whereas the third depiction illustrates Apocalypse 1. We can only speculate about the reasons for this bizarre order. Was the correct order of the biblical text not important to Kirchner? Maybe he did not tip the sketches into the sketchbook himself? Was it his partner, Erna Schilling, who did not know the sequence? In any case, Kirchner obviously did not check or mind when he later added the date. Therefore, we cannot be sure if he actually wanted the sheet illustrating Saint John’s Vision of the Seven Candlesticks (fig. 4; drawing 4), with whose analysis we want to begin, to open his series.<fig id="fg4" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         </p>
         <p>In our discussion of the images, we follow the narrative order of the biblical text rather than their sequence in the sketchbook and compare them to the thematically similar series of woodcuts by Albrecht Dürer, who is of course the most important illustrator of the Apocalypse in the visual arts.<sup>15</sup> Kirchner admired Dürer as the “greatest German master” and “father” of all new German art.<sup>16</sup> We know that he had already studied his works in 1903 at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg and that he owned books about Dürer’s drawings and paintings.<sup>17</sup>
         </p>
         <p>In contrast to Kirchner, Albrecht Dürer follows the Apocalypse text consistently and opens his woodcut series with an illustration of Saint John’s Vision of the Seven Candlesticks (fig. 5). The biblical text related to this scene, Apocalypse 1: 12–20, describes how a voice addresses John on the island of Patmos. Turning around, he beholds seven golden candlesticks and, in their middle, an anthropomorphic figure with white hair, dressed in a garment and a girdle: God. This figure holds seven stars in one hand, and a two-edged sword protrudes from its mouth. Meticulously including all these details, Dürer depicts John falling to his knees and receiving the divine order to “write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter” (Apocalypse 1: 19). Kirchner, however, focuses on the figure of God, whom he places at the center of the drawing with the left arm raised (see fig. 4). In his right hand, one can see the seven stars, representing the seven communities to which John is supposed to send his writings. The sword in the figure’s mouth is also identifiable. The seven candlesticks, of which only five are depicted in Kirchner’s drawing, surround the divine appearance. The rapid coloring in black, blue, yellow, and red accounts for the drawing’s remarkable vibrancy. The red color of the stars, the stark contrasts between yellow and blue, and the vivacious brushwork dramatize the biblical narrative.<fig id="fg5" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>One decisive difference between the two depictions of this scene by Dürer and Kirchner is the total omission of the figure of Saint John in the latter’s rendition, thus emphasizing the notion of the vision rather than the witness. Dürer’s intention was to illustrate faithfully this passage of the Holy Bible, which results in a distance between the beholder and the image. Kirchner, by contrast, aims at overcoming this distance by directly exposing the beholder to the epiphany. This immediacy is enhanced by the spontaneity of the sketch itself, which almost gives the impression of the artist witnessing and recording the moment.</p>

      <sec id="sc5">
         <title>V</title>
         <p>The scene of the Twenty-Four Elders before the Throne (drawing 2) appears as the first image of Kirchner’s Apocalypse sequence in the GRI album but illustrates chapter 4 in the Apocalypse narrative, several chapters after Saint John’s Vision of the Seven Candlesticks. John describes God sitting on a throne under an emerald-like rainbow, surrounded by the Twenty-Four Elders, also sitting on thrones and presenting their crowns to God. Adjacent to the godly throne are the symbols of the four Evangelists: a lion, an ox, a human head, and an eagle.</p>
         <p>Kirchner composes this scene in rapid strokes, depicting God frontally, his right arm raised in blessing, with the Elders seated in front of him. His face and arms, yet especially the Evangelists’ symbols, are accentuated in contrasting bold colors. Color also highlights the setting sun to the right and the rainbow, which is colored not according to Newton’s theory of the light spectrum but after the sequence preferred by many artists, red-yellow-blue.</p>
         <p>Dürer illustrates this scene in one of his woodcuts as well, but again creates a greater distance between beholder and image. He renders the scene as a heavenly vision in the upper part of the woodcut, framed by the open doors of Heaven’s Gate. Saint John kneels before God, who, enthroned in a mandorla, is surrounded by a circle of the Twenty-Four Elders holding their crowns. In the lower register, a picturesque landscape unfolds with a castle at its center. In his detailed depictions, Dürer follows the text more closely than Kirchner. Rays of light flicker from the gate and seven candlesticks float above the throne—both motifs mentioned in the biblical text. Omitting those details in favor of a more impulsive way of drawing brings Kirchner’s work once again closer to the beholder.</p>
         <p>In Apocalypse 5, John recounts how God hands to the Lamb the Book with the Seven Seals, which nobody else is worthy enough to open (depicted in drawing 3 of the Kirchner album). In Kirchner’s rendition, the setting from the previous drawing is essentially repeated: the Elders are gathered around the throne, falling to their knees before the Lamb. Of the Lamb’s seven horns and seven eyes, as they are described in the Bible, the artist depicts only the latter and replaces the horns with a cross. Like the preceding sketch, this work is selectively colored to emphasize single figures or features, such as God’s face and the rainbow. Dürer did not illustrate this scene.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sc6">
         <title>VI</title>
         <p>In the GRI album, the subsequent drawings depict Saint John’s Vision of the Seven Candlesticks (drawing 4, described earlier; see fig. 4) and John Devouring the Book from Apocalypse 10 (drawing 5), an illustration that follows later in the narrative sequence and to which we will therefore return later. Following the biblical sequence, the next event entails a description of the consequences resulting from the opening of the Book. The most gruesome events befall humankind, beginning with the opening of the Seven Seals, followed by the sounding of the Seven Angels (shown in drawing 6), and ending with the Seven Vials. With the opening of the first seal in Apocalypse 6, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse emerge (depicted in drawing 8 of the Kirchner album). Following the biblical narration, Kirchner depicts the first Horseman, who symbolizes conquest, with a crown on his head and a bow in his hand, setting out on a white horse. The second and third riders are also illustrated according to the biblical specifications: one on a red horse with a huge sword, inciting war, and the other on a black horse with a pair of balances, intent on starving humankind. The fourth Horseman, placed on the right side of the image, rides a pale horse and represents death.</p>
         <p>Dürer’s famous version of the Four Horsemen in his Apocalypse woodcuts is decidedly more dramatic. He renders the riders, accompanied by an angel, in the very act of charging ahead, trampling over people huddling at the bottom of the image. The horses are captured in full gallop, and the grim-faced riders swing their weapons. Compared to the dynamic movement of this design, Kirchner, who refrained from imitating it, chooses a more static composition with straighter outlines. His illustration can be read as a reference to the calm before the storm of destruction brought forth by opening of the seals, from which the artist only selectively illustrated.</p>
         <p>Drawing 11 in Kirchner’s Apocalypse sequence is rather difficult to identify. Most likely, it refers to the Torment of Humankind by the Locusts that ascend from a bottomless pit when the fifth angel sounds his trumpet (Apocalypse 9: 1–11). The Bible describes these creatures as half human, half animal, shaped like horses prepared for battle and equipped with iron breastplates. Because Kirchner executed this drawing swiftly, generating a blurred composition with few identifiable iconographic details—apart from the green figures in the foreground, presumably representing the poisonous locusts—it is difficult to ascertain whether the scene pertains to the correspondent text. Dürer illustrated not this particular torment but rather the opening of the fifth and sixth seals, which leads to the trembling of the earth, the darkening of the sky, and the stars falling from the sky.</p>

         <title>VII</title>
         <p>The next scene illustrated by both Kirchner and Dürer shows John Devouring the Book (Apocalypse 10: 8–11), which is offered to him by an angel. According to the angel, the book tastes as sweet as honey. With its ingestion, John is charged to spread his prophecy among many peoples, nations, and kings. In this case, Kirchner adheres very closely to the biblical passage. His drawing shows the angel in a red robe approaching from the left and feeding the holy book to the kneeling, praying John, who is dressed in blue (fig. 6; drawing 5 in the Kirchner album). The scene is embedded in a mountainous landscape, colored in hues of ocher.<fig id="fg6" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>The corresponding illustration by Dürer, Saint John Devouring the Book, again shows numerous details, which precisely comply with and even expand upon the biblical text (fig. 7). Just as the text describes, the angel’s radiant head is framed by a rainbow and his body is cloaked in clouds. He stands on two fiery pillars, one upon the sea and the other upon the earth. The book is open, just as the Apocalypse details. Moreover, Dürer includes the oath that the angel swears with his right hand in Apocalypse 10: 8: “that there should be time no longer.” The artist therefore subsumes in one scene various successive events from the biblical description, according to which the angel seals the book before handing it to John. Kirchner, who depicts the book as closed, thus picks the pivotal moment of this chapter and refrains from adding further particularities.<fig id="fg7" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>The subsequent scene in the biblical narrative concerns the Woman Clothed with the Sun and the Dragon from Apocalypse 12—a text passage that must have fascinated Kirchner as he illustrated it with two drawings (drawings 9, 10). The first drawing places the woman at the center of the composition. As the Bible specifies, she is naked and clothed only with the sun, which, in Kirchner’s work, is indicated by a yellow aureole and matching gown. The text describes her as pregnant, which Kirchner suggests with a few lines as well as the protective gesture with which she covers her abdomen. Above her, the red dragon hovers menacingly. As in the previous drawings, Kirchner omits several elements of the narrative, such as the dragon’s seven heads and ten horns, in favor of a simplified and thereby more immediate impression. His depiction is focused and thus once more contrasts with Dürer’s detailed woodcut of the same scene, which embraces the visionary imagery of the Revelation more closely. Kirchner, who, with his next work, turns to the persecution of the woman by the dragon, leaves out the ensuing battle between the angel and the dragon, which Dürer depicts in his famous woodcut. In Kirchner’s illustration, the beast has been cast to the earth by the angel and approaches the woman from the left corner of the image. The woman, who just delivered her child, tries to flee with outstretched arms, turning back in horror at her persecutor.</p>

         <p>Chapter 15 of the Apocalypse tells of the Seven Angels that send forth the final plagues before God’s wrath ends: “And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God” (Apocalypse 15: 2). This scene informs Kirchner’s drawing, in which the viewer clearly detects the seven assembled angels with their adumbrated harps (drawing 6). Kirchner chooses an upright page format for this relatively static scene, in which the choir of angels appears to be absorbed by its chant. The sea of glass mingled with fire, which the Bible tells us about, appears rather threatening and portentous. In Dürer’s woodcut series, this scene cannot be found.</p>
         <p>The vials filled with God’s wrath that the angels pour over the world is the subsequent illustration in Kirchner’s sketchbook (drawing 7). Of the four angels whose actions are specified in the Bible, Kirchner depicts three: the second and third angel, who pour their vials into the sea and into the rivers, respectively, thus transforming them into blood; and the fourth, who pours his vial over the sun, thereby scorching the people with fire. Naked figures, writhing in despair and pain and fighting for their lives, occupy the lower part of Kirchner’s drawing.</p>
         <p>The last drawing of Kirchner’s series focuses on the Whore of Babylon from Apocalypse 17 (drawing 12). She enters the image from the left atop a scarlet animal, which, contrary to the biblical description of a dragon, rather resembles a goat. Other than a scarlet cape, she is naked. Her prominent, voluptuous breasts convey her livelihood. In her right hand, she holds a golden cup, filled with the “abominations and filthiness of her fornication” (Apocalypse 17: 4). Dürer also dedicates one of his woodcuts to this very famous figure. In his detailed and very precise manner, he depicts not only the numerous heads of the dragon but also the men before whom the whore, drunken with the blood of the saints and the blood of the martyrs of Jesus, is paraded. Several angels populate the sky.</p>

         <p>It is important to consider what guided Kirchner’s choice to illustrate the particular themes he picked from the text of the Apocalypse. After seven plagues, which humankind has to endure three times, pass, the Apocalypse ends with the epiphany of the New Jerusalem and the creation of a new world. The concluding chapters of the book describe the Last Judgment while focusing on the hope for a new, better world. Kirchner’s choice of topics does not completely cover these issues. Although he chose some of the principal subjects for his illustrations, the main message of the Apocalypse can be only partly understood from his series, which he of course may not have considered complete. Most important, the positive outcome, the formation of a new society, is missing. Dürer’s woodcuts, in contrast, not only exhaustively render the narrative of the book but also focus on the religious message of a new beginning that is inherent in Saint John’s narrative.</p>
         <p>We do not know if Kirchner intended to create more illustrations, for which he just may not have had the time or strength. However, assuming that the extant images reflect his interests, we can conclude that Kirchner was interpreting the Apocalypse in a very personal way—a conclusion that becomes even more likely after the comparison to Dürer’s work. It is of course difficult for every artist to compete with this great German artist of the sixteenth century. Of all of Kirchner’s drawings, only the representation of Saint John’s Vision of the Seven Candlesticks is directly comparable to Dürer’s work, which is a very impressive composition that Kirchner may have recalled fairly precisely (see figs. 4, 5). Still, he withdrew Saint John from the image. There is no doubt that the artist was familiar with the woodcuts by Dürer, but we cannot be sure if he had access to reproductions during his time at Bellevue Sanatorium, where he most likely created his illustrations. With the exception of Saint John’s Vision of the Seven Candlesticks, direct references to Dürer’s images cannot be identified.</p>
         <p>It could therefore be argued that the expressionist’s choice was a personal one, even more so when considering the situation during which he produced the sketches. The artist did not care much for the precise religious context, nor did he aim to render the complete story. Kirchner’s illustrations have to be understood as an individual’s fascination with specific passages in the biblical text and as personalized reading informed by his current desperate mental and physical situation in an overall climate of anxiety.</p>
         <p>Kirchner’s omission of the ultimately hopeful, positive ending of Saint John’s narrative, as well as his emphasis on the gruesome events and the unholy chaos, is characteristic for a series of apocalyptic depictions in the early twentieth century. The artist was certainly familiar with the depictions of disasters imagined by the expressionist painter Ludwig Meidner, in his <italic>Apocalyptic Landscapes</italic> from the early 1910s (fig. 8). These paintings, executed several years before World War I, were not merely illustrations of the biblical text but visions of destruction by an artist whose hope for a new beginning and a transformed society—a hope he shared with many of his contemporaries—had been crushed. Painters and writers alike, among them Lovis Corinth, Georg Heym, Jakob van Hoddis, Franz Marc, Wassily Kandinsky, or Georg Trakl, channeled their expectations, their disappointment, and fears into apocalyptic imagery with various emphases.<sup>18</sup> Kandinsky, for example, featured scenes of resurrection and allusions to spiritual renewal, thus conveying a more complete comprehension of the apocalyptic narrative. Kirchner’s images of the Apocalypse, though, illustrate a completely different understanding of the Apocalypse. His interpretation of the text alludes instead to his personal fate as an artist and the inner conflicts he had to face as a human being. It is not unlikely that Kirchner had known his fellow artists’ works and that they might have contributed to his interest in the topic. Religious subjects had so far been largely absent in the artist’s oeuvre.<sup>19</sup>

         <p>In 1918, however, Kirchner had created another woodcut series that deals with a topic from the Bible: Absalom. It is interesting to note that the religious subjects of Absalom and the Apocalypse were conceived in a certain proximity of time. In his art, Kirchner was usually interested in depicting his immediate environment, the real life taking place around him. The shift in interest toward religious subjects attests to how the artist, perhaps under the impression of his fate, increasingly turned away from the observation of his direct surroundings and rather immersed himself in imagination.</p>

         <p>Two decades later, in 1935, now living permanently in Davos, Kirchner’s condition had started to worsen again. Both he and his partner, Erna, struggled with health problems. Even worse, his greatest fear became manifest again in rumors of an imminent war. The crises he endured during the years of World War I returned: “if the horrors of a war should come over Europe again, it would be better to be dead. Sick, miserable, alone, ‘<italic>oh who would inhabit this black world alone?</italic>’ ”<sup>20</sup>
         </p>
         <p>As with other expressionists, Kirchner’s reputation as an artist in Germany severely suffered when the National Socialists assumed power. Collectors and museum directors, who had patronized Kirchner’s art, were replaced and expelled one after another.<sup>21</sup> Exhibition opportunities ceased, sales became impossible. Kirchner’s most important purpose in his life, his art, was publicly ostracized and savaged when 639 of his works were declared “Degenerate Art” and many were destroyed by the Nazi regime. Sad and helpless, the artist witnessed the obliteration of his personal and artistic ideals, efforts, and hopes that were, without a doubt, ambitious: “War is in the air. In the museums, the laboriously achieved culture of the last twenty years is being destroyed.”<sup>22</sup> During that time, in the fall of 1935, Kirchner was intently focused on the possibility of painting the apse of a small chapel in Davos-Frauenkirch. It becomes clear that the topic of the Apocalypse had, over all the years, not left him. In a letter to his friend Carl Hagemann from 28 November 1935, Kirchner described his plans to paint the chapel:
<disp-quote>
               <p>I enclose a photograph of an old image of the Frauenkirchlein, in which I hopefully will be able to execute a mural after all. It is very popular to get married in this little chapel and as a lot of foreigners come to visit, it would be nice if it would receive a little decoration. In the meantime, I am making sketches and would be very excited if I could do this job for free as money is lacking. I intend to paint the Apocalypse in single images.<sup>23</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
Comparing the apocalyptic angels pouring out the vials with the plagues to aircrafts carrying gas bombs, Kirchner saw the Apocalypse as a fitting subject for the current period overshadowed by yet another deadly war.<sup>24</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Unfortunately, just like with most of his other muralist endeavors, the commission was never executed.<sup>25</sup> Today, due to lack of documents, it is impossible to reconstruct the reasons for this failed commission or to obtain a better insight into the background of this project. No documents have been preserved in the archives of the church administration or the parish office. We even cannot be sure if Kirchner intended to use any of the sketches from the 1917 Apocalypse album for his paintings. One of the only known visual references for the artist’s plans can be found, again, in Kirchner’s sketchbooks. Sketchbook number 173 (in a private collection), which Kirchner used from 1934 to 1938, contains a comprehensive view of the apse and offers us a vague idea of the overall concept. It is the sketchbook that the artist carried with him when he took his life in 1938.<sup>26</sup>
