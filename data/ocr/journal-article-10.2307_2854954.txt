(Mediaevalia Lovaniensia, I, 3.) Louvain: Louvain University Press; The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1975. Paper. Pp. xvi, 268; 4 color plates, 24 black-and-white plates. F950. COMPARATIVELY alone among the epic genres, the animal (or beast) epic retained its vitality for more than eight centuries. The tales of its foxy hero remained sufficiently malleable to reflect the concealed chaos in an apparently ordered society from the dawn of feudalism to the days of the Dreyfus affair. Thus, as a genre, the beast epic is best approached in a concerted effort by teams of specialists from different fields.</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 737 In 1972, an international colloquium dedicated to its interdisciplinary discussion met at Louvain University; the papers read on this occasion became available in print three years later. Their importance lies in the fact that they offer the scholar a choice of interdisciplinary methods with which to approach his particular field. As such they have not suffered from the three-year delay in publication. Printing and plates are of fine quality and prove that all-around excellence is still attainable, though at a price. For the most part, the offerings concentrate on the vernacular versions of western Europe and clarify the unusual complexity attendant on any discussion of the beast epic by their wealth of interdisciplinary techniques. In contrast, analyses by conven- tional methods demonstrate better than any polemics that, for this particular genre at least, literary criticism limited to traditional philological analyses may be nearing the limits of its potential. Taken as a whole, the volume indicates an emerging consensus among scholars: less concern with the "oral tradition," a demand for closer scrutiny of contemporary writings in related disciplines (history, geography, zoology, the law) combined with comparative study of lexical evidence in the MSS, and recognition of the fable as a separate field of inquiry. The book opens with a review of familiar issues in the Roman de Renart (RdR), with each item characterized by new approaches that hold promise for future investigations. -J. F. Flinn questions the assumption of a clear-cut distinction be- tween bourgeois and aristocratic audiences for medieval works. He notes the legal- clerical background of the early branches and the allegorical treatment of the Renart figure in the later ones, remarking that the clerical authors of the RdR may have mocked the social order but never questioned its validity. The subjective, bitter treatment of the social structure in Renart le Contrefait is the only exception. - 0. Jodogne reviews anthropomorphism in the RdR on a lexical basis, comparing animal behavior in the different branches, and decides that dating the branches by the frequency of such features is an oversimplification. The humor resulting from a mixture of human and animal traits is consciously reinforced by the systematic use of images that transcend conceptual phantasy (e.g., hedgehog decapitating camel). - G. van Dievoet reviews the royal peace decreed by King Noble, Renart's citations to court, and the trial procedure, and calls for a comparative treatment of the legalities. Focussing on the later RdR branches and citing detailed documentation from French and Flemish legal source material, he reviews the history of scholarship in this area and provides material for future critical evaluation. The five articles on the Flemish Reinaert perhaps document best how interdiscipli- nary approaches to long familiar material may result in new insights. - E. Rom- bauts analyzes Grimbeert's defence of Reinaert before Noble as an example of formal rhetoric. As oratio judicalis the speech is a structural pendant to Reinaert's confessio. - L. Peeters advocates comparative study of Reinaert MSS using prefixes, prepositions, verb forms and shifts in meanings, which he illustrates by analyzing the church ban. The trip over zee (A 2719) is customarily interpreted as either a reference to the Holy Land or literally as "across open water." In the latter case, as we know, the trip would place the fox in periculum mortis, a state in which the anathema which he claims to have incurred could also be removed by local clergy and not exclusively by the pope. Peeters remarks that in Henry II's time this stratagem found political application in England and points to Archdeacon Geoffrey Riedel of the king's party and one of Becket's main antagonists, whose name might explain the reference to MeesterJufroet (A 2952) and his doubtful theology on the basis of the close contacts between England and Flanders at the time. Closer investigation of a fourteenth-</page><page sequence="3">738 Reviews century conflict regarding canon law procedures between the dioceses of Utrecht and Kamerijk produces good reasons for the change in text from thirteenth-century deken Herman (A and F) to fourteenth-century Herman die Provisoor (B). Thus Peeters finds plausible explanations for two persistent trouble spots in the Reinaert texts. - M. Gysseling, analyzing contemporary geographic-documentation on the Ghent-Waas landscape in combination with interal textual evidence from Van den Vos Reinaerde (Reinaert I), places the original version at St. Bavo in Ghent, written between 1185 and 1191. - Canon law procedures for Ghent, Utrecht and Doornik persuade D. Lambrecht that the tale of Reinaert's excommunication conforms to twelfth-century Four Department (vier ambachten) usage and that, as far as the plot is concerned, Reinaert preserves his life by raising the issue of the ban. -J. Deschamp's descrip- tion of the Reinaert I fragment (MS H. Brussels Royal Library IV 774), discovered in June 1971, completes the selection. H is a small, one-column, paper MS without subdivisions, in cursive, with a text independent of both A and F versions, hence of considerable importance. R. F. Blake questions the assumption that English animal stories demonstrate familiarity with the RdR cycle in thirteenth-century England. No reference to it is known and the fact that Chaucer's Nun Priest's Tale has a moral would rather point to a fable source. Caxton's use of a Dutch version for his 1481 translation suggests that he, too, was unaware of a French version, in view of his known preference for French originals. - K. Varty on the other hand, believes that the English did know the RdR at the time and that Flemish versions simply became more popular later. His views are based on a Walters Art Gallery (Baltimore) Book of Hours, the misericords of Bristol Cathedral, and woodcuts in the 1620 and 1629 London History of Reynard the Fox, which he has traced to a partially lost Amsterdam edition by Gerard Leeu (1487) that also influenced the 1498 Lubeck Reinke de Vos woodcuts. Neither Blake nor Varty refer to the oral tradition in support of their respective views, which has so often been cited to explain discrepancies between pictorial and written evidence. Discussing the depiction of RdR scenes on the European continent, J. F. Flinn surveys MS illustrations and sculptures. Favorite MS scenes were: Renart and Chantecler, Renart preaching, Renart as monk. Flinn also notes an instance of tableaux vivants, "la vie de Renart," in 1313 at Paris. Cathedral sculptures were sometimes destroyed as offensive, so that written records have to be searched in order to gain a perspective. In sculpture, Renart's funeral procession is a frequent subject. Wandering artisans from the Low Countries spread the Renart themes through Europe and are responsible for their appearance on Spanish churches. Extensive listings of the different types and their location complete Flinn's survey. A. Welkenhuysen confirms data on the Flemish Reynardus Vulpes first offered by Huygens in his 1968 edition. Welkenhuysen adds details that confirm the literary erudition of the Reynardus poet. - W. Berschin gives a revaluation of the references to the Cologne St. Gereon's column in the Latin Ysengrimus (2.179ff.; 4.25f.). It represents a satiric reference to St. Gereon's worship in Cologne, best appreciated by members of three monasteries in Liege, where St. Gereon was also worshipped. The reference may aid us in defining the Liege monks as the primary Ysengrimus audi- ence, since two of the surviving five MSS come from the Liege area and the Liege monks traditionally cultivated satirical poetry. K. H. Gottert believes that the emendator of the Middle High German Reinhart Fuchs attempted to restyle an old epic, which had stressed the triumph of perfidy over rashness, so that it would exemplify "foolish behavior" and fit the mold of</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 739 Mirendichtung. Gottert works with "semantic substitutions" (e.g., comparing the treatment of the -ot ending in the old S fragment with the newer *P version). His careful, methodically flawless approach proves that the emendator failed in transpos- ing the poem from one literary category to the next and, to this reviewer at least, demonstrates the limitations of a purely philological approach to a satirical genre. C. Scheffler traces the history and reception of the Low German Reinke de Vos (1498). The work's early popularity has been overestimated by the critics: the price of the Lubeck edition and initial reprint dates prove that the work was accessible only to the rich. The Reinke owes its subsequent popularity to its identification with the Protestant cause during the Reformation. The Rostock Protestant version (1539) had ten further editions, and a 1544 High German translation was frequently reworked and translated. Its Latin version (1567) by Hartmann Schopper, dedicated to Em- peror Maximilian II, was published in English in 1706. The first Danish Reinke was printed in 1555 (Horst Munske, Niederdeutsches Jahrbuch 93 [1970], 36-53, covers the Reinke reception in Skandinavia). Democratic ideas are first reflected by a 1797 Hamburg version, a satire on the Danish court; in comparison Goethe's Reineke Fuchs (1793) is harmless. Kaulbach's illustrations to the Goethe poem and A. Brennglas's Neuer Reineke Fuchs, both of 1846, reflect the pre-revolutionary mood of Germany at the time. An anonymous 1844 Stuttgart version ridicules Schelling's philosophy, an 1898 version the Dreyfus Affair. Modern editions are primarily intended for the young and the bibliophile market. Scheffler's lucid presentation motivates and relates this material and documents the ease with which the old genre adapts to new issues and evades the specialists' efforts at classification. An instance of beast epic influence on a thirteenth-century fable collection is taken up in H. Schwarzbaum's article on Rabbi Berakhia's Mishle Shu'alim (Fox Fables). The fox fables, a genre not exclusively concerned with the fox, generally stand in the Romulus fable tradition, though several of them tie in with the beast epic, among these the tales of the lion's sickness, raven and cheese, fox stealing fish from peasant's cart. Schwarzbaum also lists variant versions from western European and Arabic literatures. His firm commitment to the existence of an oral tradition in constant interchange with international folklore motifs which influences animal tales under- scores the degree to which folklore studies and beast epic scholarship have recently parted ways. - Indian fable collections are reviewed by R. D. Gupta, who points to the traditional roles of jackal, monkey, and rabbit in the Jataka tales and the Pan- catantra and remarks that in modern India a secondary influence has become notice- able: the fox, hitherto unknown to the stories, is replacing the familiar native flgures in the fables due to Western influence. The Byzantine beast epic is taken up by J. Irmscher, who reviews its history and background, noting at the same time that though he is able to offer a wealth of details, the discovery of connecting links between them has to await better editions of the poems anid publication of contemporary technical and scientific works, especially in zoology and its vocabulary. The Byzantine animal epic has its counterparts in petrological and botanical works, notably the Fruit Book, which may date back to the twelfth century and relates the tale of a trial for high treason in which fruit appear as titled Byzantine nobility. In it, the grape has the role of plaintiff, who is unmasked as an informer and sentenced to be hung on wood, cut with knives, and stepped on in order to rob mankind of their senses. The work emphasizes the dangers of wine and ridicules the Byzantine greed for titles. The Plhysiologus remained part of popular, living Byzantine tradition from antiquity on. The History of Quadrupeds reports on a</page><page sequence="5">740 Reviews failed meeting to arrange eternal peace under the lion's leadership, supposedly held in 1365. The Pulologos, tale of a marriage feast arranged by the eagle, reflects tension in Byzantium under Latin rule (1204-126 1). The Pancatantra became popular during the second half of the eleventh century in a frame-tale version, Stephanites and Ichnelates. It had been translated from Arabic at the turn of the century. A Beautiful History of Donkey, Wolf and Fox and the Legend of the Honorable Donkey derive from a fifteenth-century archetype and stand in relationship to Western Reynard material: the pilgrimage motif, the confession, church indiscretions, and wolf-monk point to the parallel. The cunning, evil fox represents the Byzantine academic in his struggle for a benefice. Wolf and fox conspire to prey on the donkey, who outwits them. In their introductory remarks the organizers state that the colloquium on the animal epic was the third in a series of meetings designed to promote interdiscipli- nary research in medieval studies. It is to be hoped that they will produce many others of similar quality. FRANK R. JACOBY Brandeis University</page></plain_text>
