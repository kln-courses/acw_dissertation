<plain_text><page sequence="1">Charles Moore, Gerald Allen, Dimensions. Space, Shape and Scale in Architecture. New York: Architectural Record Books, 1976, 183 pp., illus. $12.95. Kent C. Bloomer and Charles W. Moore with a contribution by Robert J. Yudell, Body, Memory, and Architecture, New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1977, 147 PP., Z14 illus. $15.oo (cloth); $6.95 (paperback). The essays in these books by Charles Moore and others vary from sound to tendentious, but the writing is so sophisti- cated, that even the doubtful arguments provoke a response. This mixed quality comes from the popular lay audience to which the books are addressed. They are written in a chatty, impressionistic style that tries to accomplish too much. None- theless, "inclusivism," the proclaimed phil- osophy of the authors as well as of so many architects today, is a legitimate goal even if a very difficult art, and one that unites recent practice with that of the Renaissance. These books are, perhaps, first steps towards reconstituting a tradi- tion that was broken by the exclusivism of modern architecture, which both in theory and practice discarded much more than applied ornament. Dimensions is a collection of reworked essays that Charles Moore and Gerald Allen have been writing since the late fifties. They are loosely connected to the authors' notion of dimensions-a term so inclusive as to mean almost everything.</page><page sequence="2">51 "Dimensions are independent variables. ... Height, width, and depth, which we measure with coordinates x, y, and z, are not the three dimensions, they are merely three dimensions. ... Since any indepen- dent variable can be a dimension, the num- ber of dimensions can be expanded in many directions and is completely arbi- trary, depending on what is significant to the problem at hand" (pp 1-3). Since this ecumenical definition applies to all the beasts in the field, or at least to every "problem" an architect has faced, we have to ask what the significant concerns of the authors are. These, thankfully, are finite in number. In the first three essays on space, shape, and scale these dimensions emerge as a preoccupation with architecture as it is perceived by the inhabitants of buildings. A constant popular theme runs through- out both books which emphasizes the way buildings are experienced, as a built "do- main," not as an abstract diagram of Car- tesian grid. Reflecting Suzanne Langer's definition of architecture (1953) as the illu- sion of an ethnic domain, Allen and Moore determine it as being "responsive to the perceptual dimensions of its inhabitants" (p. 7). These they suggest are various codes, some based on "body-centered space," and space perceived as radiating from a mov- ing point in 36-degree segments of a cir- cle (they use Doxiadis' model of Greek space). Additional perceptual codes re- late to "archetypal shapes" that we all enjoy and understand, such as columns, walls, and Palladian harmonies; "cultural shapes" such as verticality in Gothic; and "personal shapes" that relate only to our own memory, but are no less important. Finally, perceptual codes concerned with scale are much broader than discussions on the subject usually allow: scale is a ques- tion of relative size-the relation of a part relative to the whole, other parts, or usual size, as well as to human dimensions. All these insights are fine, if not very original, but they lack an important theo- retical base, the notion of coded percep- tion per se. If there were such a notion, then further distinctions of their argument might be clarified and we would see that basically the authors are trying to substi- tute codes of perception for codes of archi- tectural production, the professional and elite meanings with which architects have always been concerned. There is a funda- mental division, underlying more than the failure of modern architecture, that is never analyzed. On the other hand, some of the architecture analyzed and also some of Charles Moore's, surmounts the divi- sion by being coded on both levels simul- taneously. The remaining essays in Dimensions discuss buildings that can be perceived at these different levels. The Gothic Revival St. Thomas church in New York by Cram, Goodhue and Ferguson, 1911, serves two spaces-that of the street and the interior- making a mildly pleasing conjunction of the opposed requirements. The Santa Bar- bara Courthouse, 1929, a key building for Moore, incorporates not only the local Spanish revival but the giant landscape of mountains, the public realm of outdoor performances, and a kind of overblown, folksey fantasy. Clearly it is an inclusive architecture Moore has included in his own work. What it lacks in seriousness, it offers in humor and appropriateness. Other essays treat the inclusive archi- tecture of Venturi, Esherick, and even the emperor Hadrian; the exclusive architec- ture of Late Modernism-Gunnar Birkert's bank in Minneapolis; and some interme- diate cases, such as Rockefeller Center, LCC Housing, Southern traditional archi- tecture (that is of the American South), and Rudolph Schindler. It's a very mixed bag treated in a very mixed way, sometimes with sensitivity and other times with brev- ity. By far the most important and ulti- mately disappointing essay is "You Have to Pay for the Public Life," first written for Perspecta 9/io (an issue edited by the up- coming inclusivist Robert Stern in 1965). Here Charles Moore raises a crucial problem not often faced by architects. The problem is the breakdown of the public realm (the social symbolism of architec- ture), the consensual agreement to value certain building tasks above others-the church or city hall rather than the office or house-in short, public fantasies rather than private ones. Architecture, to para- phrase Galbraith, now reflects private wealth and public squalor, the dream houses of an Eisenman or Hejduk, rather than shared values that can be symbolized. Moore starts off with a frontal assault on this historical problem. "In 1964 I set out to find examples of contemporary monu- mental architecture in California which functioned as a part of the urban scene." Not deterred by the obvious lack of monu- ments and urbanity in the conventional sense, he sought to redefine their qualities: "a monument is an object whose function is to mark a place, either at that place's boundary or at its heart. . . . The act of marking is then a public act ... a function of society's taking possession of, or agree- ing upon, extraordinarily important places on the earth's surface, and of the society's celebrating their preeminance" (pp. 105- io6). Having established this traditional no- tion of the architectural monument, and admitting that in Los Angeles as elsewhere "hardly anybody gives anything to the public realm," Moore would seem to be defeated in his straightforward assault, but he then approaches the monument indi- rectly, on its flank. In the carbound, fluid world of California there are shared values and celebrated building types-the 1920s Hollywood theaters; the multi-use res- taurant centers, such as The Nut Tree; the freeways; and, of course, Disneyland. When Moore first offered these ideas in 1965 they were relevant, at least for clari- fying the issue of public symbolism and making alternative views possible. But when reissued in 1976 without further comment, the inadequacies of the argu- ment, or rather examples, become clear. Can one really claim without irony that the freeways are "the real monuments of the future?" Even disregarding the petrol situation and all the attacks on the pri- vativeness inherent in automobile culture, there is a kind of monumental flaw in Moore's own terms. These are intrinsically nonplaces, intermediate spaces, whose task is essentially functional. One may celebrate and decorate them and create magnificent sculptural loops out of their intersections, but to use a historical analogy, they will never become as significant as the great walls of a medieval city, or a Peking. They are certainly not equivalent to the piazza, the country house, the market square, or all the tasks which Moore acknowledges had crystallized a place and a monument in the past. And neither is Disneyland nor its fiber- glass Matterhorn, which he also proffers for the role. "Disneyland is enormously important and successful just because it recreates all the chances to respond to a public environment .. ." (p. 117). The fact that response is often precluded in the ride-through parks is never acknowledged. "It allows playacting, both to be watched and to be participated in." By whom and under what conditions? Clearly the many corporate sponsored theme pavilions rig- idly control perception, and herd the spec- tators into people-pens, an idea that Disney adapted from watching how large num- bers of animals were handled in the stock yards. "All this diversity, with unerring sensitivity, is keyed to the kind of partici- pation without embarrassment which ap- parently we crave" (p. 117). But is this participation or diversity? What about the countless critics who have called Disney- land the epitome of corporate fascism, an ambience which replaces cultural diver- sity by a form of ersatz replication? One needn't agree with these critics to find Moore's encomiums more like a piece of Disneyprop than a balanced, ironic</page><page sequence="3">52 argument. After Banham, Blake, Venturi, Wolfe, Goldberger, Finch, and Archigram have celebrated the Disney corporation, itself an expanding multinational, it be- comes more difficult to add one's fulsome praise. No doubt Moore, a believer in modesty and equilibrium, has missed the chance to apply the balance and humor he uses as effectively elsewhere. Body, Memory, and Architecture, writ- ten with Kent Bloomer and Robert Yudell, is more convincing, perhaps because a central theme links the articles, and the architecture praised is both older and richer than Disneyland. The major theme, initiated by Bloomer, is somewhat origi- nal and of central importance to many architects who are trying today to invest their buildings with an anthropomorphic significance and a sense of touch. The no- tion that architecture is experienced not just visually, but through all the body's senses, is the key idea and it haunts this book just the way "spatial experience" used to dominate such writers as Giedion and Zevi. In many ways it performs the same function too, acting as a synonym for a global experience, not one reduced to one of the five senses or the mind alone. Clearly the necessity for a holistic percep- tion and description of architecture can be granted, but is the haptic perception, or code, the answer? In the fifth chapter, "Body-Image The- ory," the psychoanalytic model basic to the argument is outlined. Apparently we carry around a three-dimensional coordi- nate system which is impregnated with body-images or metaphors. In everyday speech there is a record of this fact. Thus, we refer to "the heart of the matter" and the "heartland," projecting a metaphor of our body center onto reality. If a home does not have a heart, or hearth, or if a city is without a metaphorical center, we feel something is lacking, as the authors point out. Furthermore, we talk unself- consciously about a building having a "front and back" and an "up and down." "Our basic and frontal orienting senses have developed a matrix of psychophysical coordinates that constitute our feeling of up/down, front/back, and right/left, as well as here-in-the-center. .. . Upward, which in the body image means upward from the center of the body . . . indicates striving, fantasy, and aloofness. Down- wards is depressing, but also realistic. Thus we 'reach for the sky' while feeling simultaneously the need to have a 'firm base on the ground' " (pp. 40-4I). I think this primitive coordinate system does exist and is as important to our per- ception as the authors claim (as does, Christian Norberg-Schulzl). In a sense it is empathy, or the "pathetic fallacy," by which we transpose bodily states and as- pirations onto inanimate things in order to possess them. Presumably, as more peo- ple accept this fact, and do not condemn it as an aberration of Wordsworth or Cole- ridge, we will see the phrase renamed as the "necessary fallacy." Already there are many architects de- signing face houses, body houses, and buildings in the shape of all sorts of an- thropomorphic parts. It is a pity that this current work is not illustrated, nor are the historical examples that Carl Jung gives of the face house. Indeed the body as col- umn, the face as capital, the body as plan and elevation, the whole tradition of Re- naissance humanism is only alluded to- no Vitruvian men, none of the endless anthropomorphic maps of Francesco di Giorgio, nor even Palladio's comparison of a house to a body (with its "noble" and "ugly" parts, its organs which can be seen, and those dirty "private parts" which should be hidden in our basement). The work sociologists have done on the popu- lar house and its "face" is not really sum- marized, nor the failure of some modern architecture like Pessac; the lack of a pitched roof and "head" are not analyzed. Schultz-Naumburg's Nazi tract The Face of the German House is not mentioned, a book which, minus the racism, reads some- thing like Frank Lloyd Wright crossed with this book. Guarini's dome at San Lorenzo is illustrated, but the fact that it is implic- itly coded as a face, indeed eight scowling faces of Hades (and they're up in the dome of heaven too) is ignored. The authors have overlooked this his- torical and present work in order to write an accessible account of the theory and practice of anthropomorphic architecture. The beginning of the book is illustrated with cartoon sketches underlining basic ideas, whereas the end of the text has an abundance of varied photos-rather like a romp through the ages with slides. Per- haps this evocative mode is suitable to the subject, as it stirs more the senses than the mind. The authors write quite directly about issues of "joy and beauty," two key words which we haven't heard for a long time. They reflect the twin virtues of "the pretty and the quaint," those of the Queen Anne Revival, an eclectic architecture which is close in spirit to that of Moore's. Indeed, the Post-Modern architecture that Moore and others are designing is directly comparable to this eclectic style, and equally committed to the notion of recall- ing "memories" of previous buildings and cultures. Evidently the parts of the book which Moore wrote are most concerned with his wide-ranging memory and they include quick trips to St. Peter's and the Acropolis, or lesser known beauties, such as Braga and the Wies church in Bavaria. The breadth of allusion is impressive and delightful. If there are any doubts at the end of this visual and theoretical feast, they con- cern the depth of argument. It is more im- pressionistic than definitive. It seems to me that the haptic code of perception while primary, is just one of several impor- tant ones. It may dominate the visual and mental codes, but should it dominate ex- clusively, as the authors suggest? They do not develop any theory of codes based on semiotics; this might have helped them work out a system or hierarchy of archi- tectural meanings. Also, it would have clarified their populism, their placement of codes of perception prior to codes of archi- tectural production. The profession will always tend to favor the latter, whether these are Palladian, Baroque, or invented by individuals, such as Christopher Alex- ander and Peter Eisenman. The layman will favor the former as he empathizes with architecture and reads it in terms of popular metaphor and local imagery. There is an inevitable conflict here which hasn't been explained, as the authors evince their commitment to the popular code. But one can't ask a book to do every- thing, and it is quite adequate that this one announces the reemergence of empathy and human metaphor; the boost these get from "body-image theory" is considerable, and from now on it will be harder to dis- miss such codes as "pathetic," subjective, or irrelevant. CHARLES JENCKS Architectural Association, London i. Christian Norberg-Schulz, in Exis- tence, Space and Architecture, New York: Praeger, 1971, shows similar coordinate systems as basic to experience, although he locates them on a more philosophical and cultural level.</page></plain_text>
