<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN AMERICAN-JEWISH VIEW OF THE EVOLUTION CONTROVERSY JOSEPH L. BLAU, Columbia University, New York City DURING the second half of the nineteenth century, even be fore the publication in 1859 of Darwin's Origin of Species, the central controversy in American intellectual life concerned the acceptance of the developmental hypothesis, the so-called "evolutionary theory." Evolutionary ideas existed long before Darwin, Wallace, Huxley, and Spencer in England, Le Conte, Gray, Wright, and Fiske in America became the storm-centers of the thinking world.1 Geological estimates of the age of our planet far exceeding the few thousand years allowed by students of Bib lical chronology had become the commonplace currency of scien tists.4 The science of palaeontology was still in its infancy, but discoveries had been made of fossil remains which indicated the need for some type of developmental explanation of the origins of species.3 Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson had both pre sented papers on fossil remains to the American Philosophical Society during the eighteenth century. During the decade 1850 60 various points of view on the development of species were pre sented as an incident of the controversy over slavery.4 It was not, however, until after the publication of the Origin of Species that the controversy over evolution reached full fury; 1 In America, evolutionary statements can be found in such an early work as Samuel Stanhope Smith, An Essay on the Causes of the Variety of Com plexionplexion and Figure in the Human Species (Philadelphia, 1787). Such ideas had sufficiently diffused to be utilized by Joel Barlow in his Columbiad (Philadel phia, 1807). Both Smith and Barlow followed the mutation theory of Lamarck. נ Sir Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology was published 1830-33. נ See Philip Shorr, "The Genesis of Prehistorical Research," in Isis, XXIII (1935)! 425-443. Emerson, in his essay on "Culture," made use of the infor mation he had gained from students of fossils. 4 See, for example, Nott and Glidden, Types of Mankind (Philadelphia, 1854) and the reply of Cabell, The Unity of Mankind (New York, 1859). 617</page><page sequence="2">618 JOSEPH L. BLAU [2] the further publication, in 1871, of Darwin's Descent of Man added fuel to the blazing fire. Scientists accepting the principle of devel opment differed with each other on the acceptance of Darwinism. Dogmatic theologians of the Christian faith rejected or accepted Darwinism or any other form of evolutionism to the degree that they could absorb it into their religious systems. More philosophic minds among the Christian theologians tended to accept Darwin ism if they were Calvinists, to accept Spencer's more optimistic statement in the non-materialistic form given it by Fiske if they were Unitarians.5 An era of bad feeling and name-calling began which involved people in every intellectual occupation and which cannot be said to have ended until after the Scopes "Monkey Trial" in Tennessee in 1925.6 In many communities, particularly in the South, academic freedom was forced to yield to Christian fundamentalism. James Woodrow, professor of natural science in the Theological Seminary at Columbia, South Carolina, mater nal uncle of Woodrow Wilson, lost his position because of an ad dress which he delivered to the Alumni Association of the Semi nary in which he accepted the Darwinian theory of evolution, descent with modifications.7 Others shared his unfortunate ex perience. At the same time colleges all over the country found it expedient to create professorships of the harmony of religion and science, which were filled either by scientists whose religious back ground was impeccable or by ministers whose hobby was science.8 5 See B. J. Loewenberg's articles "Darwinism Comes to America, 1858 1900," Mississippi Valley Historical Review, XXVIII (Dec. 1941); "The Reaction of American Scientists to Darwinism," American Historical Review&lt; XXXVIII (July, 1933); "The Controversy over Evolution in New England," New New England Quarterly, VIII (1933), 232-57; Sidney Ratner's "Evolution and the Rise of the Scientific Spirit in America," Philosophy of Science, III (1936), 104-22; Merle Curti, The Growth of American Thought (New York, !943)-943ז), pp. 532-575; Daniel Day Williams, The Andover Liberals (New York, 1941). The treatment in Herbert W. Schneider's "The Influence of Darwin and Spencer on American Philosophical Theology," Journal of the History of Ideas,Ideas, VI (1945), 3-18, is the best clarification of the impact of these two forms of evolutionary theory on Christian religious thought in America. 6 For an analysis of the issues in this trial see Walter Lippmann, American InnuisitorsInnuisitors (New York, 1928). 7 James Woodrow, Evolution (Columbia, S.

Why were men and institutions which had been unconcerned about previous expres sions of the developmental hypothesis such as Lamarck's theory of mutations, suddenly whipped into a frenzy of agitated contro versy by the works of Darwin and his co-workers? Primarily the reason was that the researches of Darwin established organic evo lution on a firm biological base and thus came directly into con flict with the doctrine of special creations expressed in the first chapter of Genesis. Further, Darwin's hypothesis, by setting forth an explanation of the differentiation of species in terms of natural law, tended to minimize the scope for miraculous Divine inter vention in the governing of the world. Thus it reduced the omnipo tent, omniscient, omnipresent personal God of the theological tradition to a remote First Cause, who set the universe in motion, and then left it severely alone, in the grip of a multitude of second causes. This was interpreted as atheism. "An absent God," said Charles Hodge of Princeton, "who does nothing is, to us, no God."9 Next, Darwinism seemed to discredit the popular design argument. Finally, Darwinism, by bolstering up the general evo lutionary argument, cast serious doubts on the Scriptural accounts of creation and of miracles, on Biblical chronology, and on the position of man in the world. All in all, the Darwinian theory of evolution placed Christian theology in the least enviable position it had been in since the time of Copernicus's heliocentric theory. Small wonder that the reaction was hysterical! II In July, 1883, four young men were ordained as rabbis in the first such ceremony to take place under the auspices of an American Jewish institution, the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. These interested in geology because of a glacial outcropping in the back yard of his parsonage. He became one of America's outstanding geologists, an expert on glacial remains, and professor of the harmony of science and religion at Oberlin College. 5 Charles Hodge, What is Darwinism?

They were the earliest members of an ever-increasing group to whom the intellectual life of America was by sympathy an open book. Even their revered teacher, the founder of the Hebrew Union College, Isaac Mayer Wise, who thought of himself as "a Jew in the synagogue, an American everywhere," viewed American ideas out of a European background, was a naturalized rather than a natural American. One of the pioneer four, Rabbi Joseph Krauskopf, who served American Jewry with distinction until his death in 1924, accepted his first pulpit in Kansas City, Missouri.10 In the winter of 1886-87, Krauskopf delivered a series of popular lectures at his synagogue under the general title Evolution and Judaism. These lectures were published in 1887 by Berkowitz and Company of Kansas City. In this series of talks, the young rabbi expressed a definite and clear position with regard to evolution which it is the pur pose of this article to analyze. Because of Krauskopf's background, which had been described above, the title given this article is appropriate, although by no means did all American Jews concur in Krauskopf's views. In his "Preface" to the published lectures the young Rabbi indicated his purpose thus: "In the preparation of these lectures the author had but these ends in view: to bring the ponderous problems of Philosophy and Science, as influencing Religious Thought, within the easy comprehension of the average LAY MAN, and to remove some of that skepticism which is engendered by a poorly understood science." He also indicated the continuity of of his work with the trend which has been mentioned for the har monizing of religion and science in this statement: The author recognizes that science and religion are indepen dent branches of thought, and that there is no necessary con nection between them; but as the great mass of believers insists upon bringing certain primitive speculations of a purely 10 Details of Krauskopf's career may be found in the Proceedings of the Central Conference of American Rabbis for 1924.

Krauskopf's Preface is followed by a list of the principal authors consulted by him in preparing the lectures. The list is virtually a "Who's Who" of the evolution controversy in England and America. Among the American authors who are mentioned are Louis Agassiz, the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher, Edward Drinker Cope, the distinguished naturalist, James D. Dana, the geologist, John Fiske, Asa Gray, James McCosh, president of Princeton University, Simon Newcomb, the astronomer, and Alex ander Winchell, the geologist and palaeontologist, whose works on the theory of pre-Adamite humanity attracted much atten tion. It is noteworthy that this list is heavily weighted on the side of science, but that the scientists were not all adherents of evolutionary theories. On the other hand, both the Christian divines, Beecher and McCosh, were evolutionists. A similar divi sion of opinion is evident among the English writers named. The list in its fullness indicates that Krauskopf approached his topic open-mindedly and read widely all points of view on his subject. The course started with a lecture on "The Dynamic and the Static Force of Religion." Krauskopf maintains that a balance of these two forces is necessary, that where either is too predomi nant, religion degenerates. Both forces have existed and been operative in religion from its earliest day. From the very dawn of time, when man first began to think, when he first set his intellect to work to ferret out the origin of things, to peer through the vail of mystery, to postulate an adequate theory of creation and its Creator, and of man and his destiny, to formulate beliefs and articles of creed, down to this very day, the dynamic and the static forces have ever been active in the domains of religion; there have always been the progressive and the retarding forces, the force pushing forward and onward, and the force keeping in check, holding on, con servative, pulling back, impeding development. . . The pro gressive belief of one age becomes the conservative doctrines of</page><page sequence="6">622 JOSEPH L. BLAU [6] the next, while the conservative teaching of the preceding generation is inadequate to the spiritual wants of the next generation."" Thus, in the very opening of his lectures, Krauskopf presented his Friday evening auditors with a definitely evolutionary philo sophy of religion. True, he expressed a gradualist point of view; he was not an advocate of the overturning of religious tradition. His insistence was on the need for controlled change. Our present entire civilization would rush toward hopeless ruin, the entire human family would speed back again to the primitive state of man, were no static force to act as counter irritant upon the dynamic, were not cautious and conserva tive and checking influence to bear upon and hold within bounds the madly forward-rushing progressive spirit, athirst after religious changes and innovations, after rooting up and tearing down." Controlled change, however, he accepted gladly, even present ing the thought that "varying shades of intellect imply varying degrees of religious development, and the religion suited for the farthest advanced can never become the religion of the lowest in mental culture, nor can the religion of the latter be imposed on the former."13 This, in turn, leads him to the idea that in each age there is in existence a religion of the past and a religion of the future, accept able to different levels of the population. Such a discrimination he feels to be necessary because religious ideas can only lead to moral rectitude if they are vitally significant to each believer. Thinkable, but unknowable and unimaginable abstractions may satisfy the religious craving of the highly intellectual, but the untutored must have creeds which they can grasp and vividly picture to themselves. And so each age, made up of the intellectual and the untutored, has exponents of the mental status of the past and of the coming age. The one is in har mony with the Religion of the Past, and the other with the Religion of the Future24 11 Evolution and Judaism, I, 4-5. "" Ibid., I, 7. 13 Ibid., I, 8. יי Ibid., I, 9. Italics in the original.</page><page sequence="7">[7] A JEWISH VIEW OF THE EVOLUTION CONTROVERSY 623 To these two forces, reactionary and progressive, Krauskopf applies the physical principle of the balance of forces. He might equally well have applied the principle of Hegelian dialectic; it is significant of his training and his background that he chose the physical principle. The resultant of the religion of the past and that of the future, taking "a course of its own midway between the two, a rational modification of the two, and taking its Thought from the Religion of the Future and its sentiment from the Relig ion of the Past, ... is the Religion of the PresentThe thought of the religion of the future is "the science-permeated theology," which is the "teaching that the religion of the future shall be as grounded upon the facts of science as the religion of the past was based upon the abstractions of metaphysics."15 This thought, this teaching he associates with some form of the "doctrine" of evolution. If we are to have a true knowledge of the Religion of the Present [he continues] it is of the utmost importance that this Doctrine of Evolution be thoroughly analyzed, that it be well understood, *hat its scientific data be contrasted with the metaphysical data of the theology of the past, that the unten able in both be eliminated, and thus a true reconciliation be effected.16 As an illustration of the work of the series, Krauskopf presents a brief contrast of creation as described in the religious tradition and as taught by evolution. He does not attempt the reconcilia tion of these diverse statements here, but reemphasizes the need for reconciliation. He does state emphatically, however, that the evolutionary theory "contains truth, and much truth, too,"17 and "that pure Judaism stands unshaken by pure Evolution."18 This statement he defends in a manner familiar to any student of the controversy in his period by arguing that the unfolding of a phenomenon in accord with Natural Law does not take either the Phenomenon or the Law out of the hand of the Creator. Even the most extreme of evolutionists 15 Ibid., I, 10. Italics in the original. 16 Ibid., I, it. 17 Ibid., I, 13. 18 Ibid., I, 14.</page><page sequence="8">624 JOSEPH L. BLAU [8] explain only gradual succession but never the Origin . . . Evo lution has not, and can not account for the Origin of Matter, of Natural Law and of Origin of Life... It is forced to con fess the existence of some Power behind matter and force which has brought them into existence and has given them their eternal properties and laws . . . Every evidence for evo lution is evidence for the existence and work of an Evolver.19 One more of the presuppositions of Krauskopf in his opening lecture remains to be presented. This is his belief that "a faith based upon fairly demonstrable [probable?] scientific facts will ever have greater validity than that which rests wholly upon demonstrable metaphysical abstractions."20 It is this preference for inductively derived principles, this positivistic, anti-intel lectual point of view which leads him to the belief that evolu tionary science "does not destroy foundations, nor sap faith, nor weaken the moral sense. It comes to purify and to strengthen."21 It is evident from this opening lecture that, however open mindedly Krauskopf had approached his subject and however widely he had read on all sides of the controveisy, his mind was now made up. He had decided to accept the evolutionary hypoth esis as a doctrine, and to bring Judaism into accord with evolu tion, to reconcile religion with science rather than religion and science. In the reconciliation thus carried out he asserted that "gently, and lovingly, and thoughtfully shall Evolution deal with Judaism."22 Ill With the background provided by this full analysis of Krauskopf's first lecture, the general tenor of the remaining fifteen should be clear. Everything in the tradition of Judaism which can not be brought into accord with one or another evolutionary hypothesis is referred to the abstract metaphysics of the past and dismissed. A brief survey of these lectures will indicate some of the more important points which Krauskopf presents. In summary, his " Ibid., I, 14-15.

In discussing "Evolution and the Bible" in his second talk, Rabbi Krauskopf indicates his general agreement with the criti cal view of the Scriptures. He finds the Scriptural record the pro duct of inspiration rather than of revelation, showing the hand of man rather than the hand of God. While expressing his reverence for the Bible as "the most potent instrument for religious and moral instruction" and "because it contains the record of the con secration of the Hebrew people to their mission as the priest people of the One God," he does not hesitate to differ from its scientific statements, "because morals, not science, is its legiti mate sphere."23 In his third lecture Krauskopf discusses in more detail the comparison between the Biblical and evolutionary accounts of creation which he referred to in his opening talk. He sees in the Biblical account a theory of creation very close in character to that propounded by evolutionists, so nearly pelfect, so close upon the heels of modern 'evolu tion' that... I fully believe — that had Israel not been con stantly retarded by political struggle, oppressed by inferior masters, exiled, degraded, • persecuted . . . the evolution of to-day would have been many centuries older, and the errors that now exist in our creation theory would have been long since expunged .... It is so nearly perfect that upon it alone so eminent a reasoner as Gladstone is inclined to base his belief in the inspiration of the Bible . . . that some of our most ad vanced geologists and scientists, such as Prof. Dana, Agassiz, Hugh Miller, Dr. Reusch and Principal J. W. Dawson have toiled with might and main to reconcile it with evolution, patching it here and patching it there, making the Bible con vey teachings which it never meant to convey.24 This patching process, this forcing of a new interpretation on the old writings meets with Krauskopf's severe disapproval. He feels that thus more harm is done to the cause of truth than is done by outright acceptance of the Biblical story with all its ג" Ibid., II, 16. *י Ibid., Ill, 52—53.</page><page sequence="10">626 JOSEPH L. BLAU [10] known discrepancies from scientific evidence. He objects to a reconciliation of the two theories of creation "by attaching to each verse a voluminous commentary of very subtle and ingenious reasoning. Those very few corrections which it [the Bible] needs can be made on the basis of pure theistic evolution, and there is no earthly need for any subtle and tenuous patching."25 When Krauskopf limits the corrections to those made on the basis of theistic evolution, he is denying the beliefs of the mate rialists, who insisted, as dogmatically as did their most extreme opponents, that the theory of evolution excluded the possibility of an immanent God. "I do not accept Huxley's materialism, nor that of any of his colaborers, and I thank God for the insight into His workings, which He has vouchsafed unto me, that I need not be a materialist."26 He does not, however, refuse all considéra tion to Huxley, or to Spencer, to whom he refers as "this prince of Agnostics."27 Both, he maintains, are in the right when they assert that science is not opposed to religion itself but only to the heathen mythologies and bad philosophy which survive in it. The fourth lecture, entitled "Matter and Force" is interest ing chiefly for the distinction it draws between theistic and mate rialistic evolution. In this it becomes evident that, like most other theological writers on the subject, Krauskopf was disturbed by the agnosticism of Huxley and his disciples rather than by their materialism. He makes the unusual suggestion that evolution of a sort is operative upon the evolutionists themselves, causing them to progress from the lower, materialistic forms of evolu tionary theory to its higher, theistic form. "Materialistic evo lutionists become more and more theistic. The law of evolution extends even to their mode of reasoning, and it is more and more purged of its faultiness. Their number dwindles with each day."28 Lecture the fifth on "The Nebular Hypothesis" contains a good statement of the use made by theistic evolution of the pro toplasmic theory, in terms of natural law. « Ibid., Ill, 53. * Ibid., Ill, 38.

It tries to prove that all organic existences, traced backward, converge until finally they meet in one common starting point in the primal God-created protoplasm, and all inorganic exis tence can be traced back to the original cloud of God-created fire mist."29 Note here that God, as First Cause, is responsible for the créa tion of the basic stuff of organic matter, protoplasm, and for the basic stuff of inorganic matter, fire mist, nebular particles, and the basic law according to which these basic forms of organic and inorganic matter exist and change. There is no suggestion of direct control of these changes by God, as in traditional religious thought, nor is there any sense of God's in-dwelling in proto plasm or nebula, which would be the pantheistic view. God's con trol is remote, through the operation of that law of nature which He has set up for the governing of His other creations. The world of man and of matter is ruled by secondary causes. Krauskopf's sixth lecture, on "Darwinism," opens with the assertion that "Order proves presence and existence of intelli gence. Supreme order is the manifestation of supreme intelli gence."30 Thus the existence of God is proved by the supreme order of the reign of natural law. "Again," he continues, "I see this 'natural law' shape matter with design and direct force with a purpose, and design and purpose presuppose intelligence."31 From this the writer is led to the major contradiction of his work, which vitiates much of his argument. In the preceding chapter, he referred to natural law as "God created."32 Now we learn that it is not merely God-created; it is 29 Ibid.., V, pp. 84-85. Italics in the original. "ג Ibid., VI, 99. 1נ Ibid., VI, 102. Italics in the original. 3נ Th-iA Ra</page><page sequence="12">628 JOSEPH L. BLAU [12] God! Furthermore, since he asserts that there must be a will superior to the law, Krauskopf stands convicted out of his own words of recognizing a will above God. This universally admitted supreme governing power, this uni versally acknowledged eternally invariable law, which pre suppose eternal and immutable supreme will — for law is but an expression of will enforced by power— this universally admitted ever present design and purpose, order and har mony which presuppose supreme intelligence, this sum of Supreme Governing Power, Supreme Will, Supreme Intelligence is named by evolutionists 'Natural Law;' by theologians it is called 'God.' The difference between the two is only in the name applied to the same power, but not in essence . . . With this conception of the nature of God every difference between science and religion disappears."33 Unquestionably! This is making religion adjust to science with a vengeance. With this as a basis, Krauskopf recommends the acceptance of the Darwinian theory of evolution as an effect of this controlling cause; and he repeats that the cause is called "Natural Law" by evolutionists, while by theologians it is called "God."34"God."34 In the seventh lecture, on "Primeval Man," Krauskopf says little, and that little is not well founded. He is chiefly concerned with evidences of supposedly human traits among animals. The four lectures following this are specific applications of a concept of progress to the intellectual, social, religious," and moral devel opment of man. These lectures are largely homiletic in character and yield no information about Krauskopf's ideas concerning evolution. The twelfth lecture, "Evolution and God" contains some in teresting personal revelation by the author. He saw the transi tion from anthropomorphism to eminence as an early stage in the evolution of the idea of God; in this stage, however, God became metaphysical, an abstraction, "thinkable only in negative attrib utes."35 A positive conception of God came through science in a later evolution of the God-idea. All this the author relates to his גג Ibid,., VI, p. 103.</page><page sequence="13">[13] A JEWISH VIEW OF THE EVOLUTION CONTROVERSY 629 own development. Significantly he says, "I have believed in a God from my childhood days. I have never been a moment with out that belief, but I had my trouble with it. My conception of God has passed through every possible stage."36 He faced the problem of evil and of suffering and that of the inconsistencies of the Bible. He considered predestination to sin and crime. He asked himself some very naive questions : I wondered what God had possibly to do all day long, (now that the work of creation was finished, that the age of miracles had ceased and the task of bringing into life and taking from it had been assigned to respective angels,) beyond judging mor tals and listening to their praises.37 Not until the young man had passed from theology to science did he learn to know God as he wished. There in science, in the department of Evolution, I could intel ligently comprehend the power I worship . . . Here I could see Him as Supreme Intelligence, Supreme Will, Supreme Power, Supreme Love. Here I could see Him as the Eternal and Immutable Law, directing all matter, organic and inor ganic, all force, physical and vital, and gradually developing all life from the simplest to the more and more complex, from the crudest to the more and more perfect, from the not living to life mortal, and from life mortal, through the gateway of death, to life eternal. . . Here were positive effects, all flow ing from a positive First Cause. Here I could see Him con stantly active and eternally creating, the Cause of all Life, the Life of all Cause.38 Anthropomorphism fled his mind before the concept of immu table law; so, too, did "the vexatious thought of an arbitrary, partial, changing and changeable God,. . . who overrules natu ral laws and occasionally sets them aside ; who is hasty and suffers himself to be worsted in an argument."39 Again he offers the con tradiction which has been met before, and presents God as both Law and the Creator of law. Thus Krauskopf's views of the evo lution of the idea of God in history are seen through and condi 3« Ibid., XII, 242. 3ל Ibid., XII, 243. 3s Ibid., XII, 243-244.

This is an analysis of the evolu tion of Krauskopf, not of the idea of God. Lecture, XIII, "Evolution and Immortality," dismisses per sonal immortality, but introduces a "life-principle" and a pan theistic definition of God as "the universal life." At the dawn of time into each of us a spark of 'the universal life' was breathed, with the divine necessity to carry it for ward, to develop and unfold it until the ultimate goal is reached. That spark has been clothed in many a garb, and has assumed many a shape. It has advanced through every stage of the lower species, and will advance through every higher state to come, until the God-like will be reached . . . When developing time comes in the slow unfolding of our spark of life, the mortal coil is returned to its primal earthly elements... while the spark of life lives and passes on to a higher and bet ter state.40 If there is something reminiscent of the Cabalistic ideas of Isaac Luria in Krauskopf's "sparks" of the universal life, there is a further echo of Luria's doctrine of gilgul, transmigration, modi fled by the Hindu conception of Karma in what follows. Whether we reach the goal sooner or later is in our power, and our own reward and punishment. The moral and intellectual development of every one of us is to-day commensurate with the care bestowed upon our culture in the life preceding, and the life succeeding will reflect the care bestowed upon the development of our life-principle to-day . . . This is the spirit ualual 'survival of the fittest.' This is the paradise after which we aspire . . . This [is] our deduction from the [law] of evolu tion. If it is new it need not therefore be false. It has the appearance of offering a more rational solution to the many intricate problems which death suggests than those which have hitherto been presented. If it is not false, then I know of no more rational stimulus towards development of what is high est in us than that given by this theory of 1Life Evolution.' "4I Lectures XIV and XV, "Evolution and Worship" and "Evo lution and Judaism," are noteworthy because in them is contained Krauskopf's first forthright admission in this volume that he is &lt;" Ibid., XIII, 264-65. י' Ibid., XIII, 265-67. Italics in the original.</page><page sequence="15">[15] A JEWISH VIEW OF THE EVOLUTION CONTROVERSY 631 speaking as a reform Jew. While his differences from traditional Judaism have been implicitly evident in his selection of such a topic as Evolution for a series of Friday evening lectures, in his treatment of the Bible, and in his depersonalization of God, here he speaks openly as a reformer. He attempts to relate the pro gram of reform to his general view of evolution as progress. His view of worship is that it should not be ritual; it "exists for the purpose of affording the divine essence within us the opportunity of frequent intercourse with God, the Essence Supreme."42 He presents a psychological interpretation of prayer which does away with the need for divine intervention in human life : When truly animated by a fervent yearning to further to its utmost the purpose for which we exist, we turn to God with prayer for aid, that prayer stimulates that divine essence within us, which is part of the piety itself, to an ever purer and an ever more intellectual life, and we are made to find within ourselves the capacities for fulfilling those very peti tions with which we turn to God.43 The substitution of empty ritual and parroted prayer for this genuine seeking of God is the fault of clerical obfuscation and the cause of the empty pews in synagogues and churches. The mind has its eternal rights. When it has outlived an age it will not permit itself to be lulled to sleep by the lullabies of the past. The church may bring its fetters to chain the mind to the beliefs and ceremonials that belong to a dead past; the freedom-loving mind will break them now, as it broke them in the past. The clergy lives in the past, the masses live in the present.44 He ends his discussion of worship on the optimistic note that "the day is dawning in which the true comprehension of the nature and requirements of God will make our every deed a prayer, and our whole life a hymnal."45 In his fifteenth lecture, Krauskopf speaks of the "Evolution of Judaism." He recites a brief religious history of the Jews from Abraham to his own time, showing how the religion of the Jews has gradually been purged of some of its grosser elements while * Ibid., XIV, 281. « Ibid., XIV, 280. « Ibid., XIV, 284. « Ibid., XIV, 287.</page><page sequence="16">632 JOSEPH L. BLAU [16] others picked up by J udaism on its historic course have remained to be a blot on the religion. Beliefs and ceremonies and rites of the Acadians and of the Egyptians, of the Assyrians and Persians, of the Greeks and Romans, of Christian and Mohammedan borrowed heathen ism, all these had sent their quota into the Talmud, into the Caballah,Caballah, into the Schulchan Aruch, into the Ghetto syna gogue, and this fantastic make-up received the name of Ortho dox Judaism.46 To Judaism thus conceived Krauskopf offers as an alterna tive what he calls "the Judaism of to-day." This is "purely a religion," and its purpose is that of "acquainting us with that much of the nature of God, which is conceivable to the finite mind . .. [and] with the modes of His revelation" and of indicat ing to us "the course we must pursue to live in the fullest har mony with the divine purpose for which we exist." Both public and private worship exist in it as a means of permitting frequent communion with God. "While proudly pointing to its peerless moral code . . . and urging a scrupulous obedience thereto, while enjoining upon its adherents the necessity of preserving the his torical identity with the past... it nevertheless strives to be in accord with the postulates of reason." This Judaism which Krauskopf suggests casts into the discard the concept of a chosen people, a kingdom of priests and a holy nation, calling this doc trine "that peculiarly Oriental notion." It recognizes "the exis tence of religious evolution ... It takes cognizance of the spirit of the age. It retains such Biblical and rabbinical beliefs and ceremonies and institutions as tend to elevate and sanctify our lives, and rejects all such, which however comforting and useful they may have been in their day, have become obsolete, mislead ing, unsuited to the spiritual wants of the age."47 Krauskopf's final summary lecture restates, as the key points in his discussion, those matters which have been presented in these pages and requires no further elaboration. Evolution evi dences the existence of an evolver, called God, who is the supreme &lt;6 Ibid., XV, 308-9.

Thus evolution strengthens religion rather than weakening it. Evolution has dealt gently with "Judaism pure and simple." IV To begin his penultimate lecture, Krauskopf quoted from the orthodox Jewish press of his day editorial comments on his lec tures. The writers of these comments branded the lecturer as an infidel worse than Ingersoll, a blasphemer, a ranter, a disgrace to the rabbinate, a recruiting agent for socialism. These state ments, from our vantage point, seem somewhat hysterically over drawn. Other charges might well have been made, however, which would have had more foundation and have been more readily substantiated from the text of the lectures. Of these the most significant is that Krauskopf at this time was not particularly consistent in his concept of God. He had undoubtedly dropped the traditional anthropomorphic ideas but he was uncertain in his own viewpoint. God sometimes appears as depersonalized power, natural law, and sometimes as personal divinity. As natural law, God performs according to His nature, but does not intervene in human affairs; as personal divinity, God is constantly creative, and as constantly concerned with mundane matters. Krauskopf is unwittingly straddling the fence on one of the most significant aspects of evolution for religion. Another weak point in the author's analysis is that he evades the Darwinian questions of the struggle for existence and the sur vival of the fittest, discussing the latter only in terms of immor tality, which he calls "the spiritual survival of the fittest." The importance of this issue lies in its relation to questions of morality. The Darwinian structure is non-moral, but especially in terms of struggle and survival contains many implications for morality. These Krauskopf fails to consider, merely asserting the validity of the traditional Jewish ethics in an evolutionary scheme. Tra ditional Jewish ethics, however, are in their essence, opposed to the struggle for survival. They are concerned with the individual functioning in society and attempt to keep a proper balance be tween individual and societal rights and obligations. There is a</page><page sequence="18">634 JOSEPH L. BLAU [18] decided blind spot in Krauskopf's failure to realize and to dis cuss this. Finally, the lecturer was disingenuous in his assertions that he entered on the subject without preconceptions. Evolution was chosen as the subject not because Krauskopf of his auditors nec essarily had any decided interest in it or in the reconciliation of Judaism and science. He chose this subject because he saw in it an excellent approach to the defense of reformed Judaism. By extending the scope of evolution from the physical to the relig ious aspects of the world, he was able, after accepting rather uncritically the evolutionary theory, to translate religious change into religious evolution. Thus he established a deterministic ratio nale for reform, which he called variously "the religion of the present" and "Judaism pure and simple." Whether this was his own idea or whether he had derived this plausible argument from Isaac M. Wise, his teacher, it evidences the fact that these Friday evening lectures were actually sermons, not lectures. Some credit attaches to Krauskopf for this series. He pre sented honestly and with as much understanding as he could a highly controversial and very technical subject. He made public profession of his acceptance of evolutionism at a time when this took high courage in a religious leader. He undertook intellectual leadership rather than intellectual domination of his congregants. Finally, the entire series was the work of a man who refused to permit his own thinking to be anything but free, of a "freeborn mind." It is in this respect particularly that it is entitled to be called "American" for the unfettered mind is the essence of Ameri canism, even in a religious leader.</page></plain_text>
