<plain_text><page sequence="1">Structuralism and Musical Plot Gregory Karl Over the past few years the relatively new branch of music criticism which has come to be called musical narratology has met with what could easily be mistaken for a challenge to its foundations. In recent writing, Carolyn Abbate, Jean- Jacques Nattiez, and Lawrence Kramer have argued that mu- sic has no narrative capacity by any accepted definition of the term. Abbate suggests that the notion of musical narrative manifests an irresistible, if sometimes misguided, human im- pulse to rationalize experience in narrative terms, claiming that "musical works have no ability to narrate in the most basic literary sense; that is, to posit a narrating survivor of the tale who speaks of it in the past tense."' Nattiez believes music incapable of the kind of specific extramusical reference the term narrative implies and consequently, "any description of [music's] formal structures in terms of narrativity is nothing but superfluous metaphor."2 He writes: "When I hear a march in Mahler's second symphony, I imagine that it's got something to do with a band of people, but I don't know which people . . . the responsibility for joining character- phantoms with action-shadows lies with me, the listener, since it does not lie within music's semiological capacities to 1Carolyn Abbate, "What the Sorcerer Said," 19th-Century Music 12 (1989): 230. 2Jean-Jacques Nattiez, "Can One Speak of Narrativity in Music?" Journal of the Royal Music Association 115 (1990): 257. join subject and predicate."3 Kramer does not question the existence of a narrative dimension in music, only its cen- trality, warning that "anyone looking to narratology as a means of illuminating musical structure and musical unity had better look somewhere else" because "narrative elements in music represent, not forces of structure, but forces of mean- ing."4 Moreover, he is inclined to locate these elements among the details of the musical foreground, so that even if narrative descriptions are not superfluous, they are superfi- cial, addressing the surface rather than the fundamental sub- stance of musical works.5 Though helpful in defining limits for the notion of musical narrativity, these arguments are nonetheless irrelevant to the narrativists' true concerns because, ironically, no major ad- vocate of musical narratology actually maintains that music narrates in any traditional sense, and none believes that mu- sical narrativity depends on the kind of naive extramusical 3Ibid., 244. 4Lawrence Kramer, "Musical Narratology: A Theoretical Outline," In- diana Theory Review 12 (1992): 162 and 161. 5In "Haydn's Chaos, Schenker's Order; or, Hermeneutics and Musical Analysis: Can They Mix?" (19th-Century Music 15 [1992]: 5), Kramer con- trasts a musical analysis dealing with "faceless deep structures" and a herme- neutics which must "pay attention to the foreground details of expression, representation, texture, and narrative or lyric impetus from which analysis necessarily abstracts." Thus the narrative elements of musical works are su- perficial phenomena far removed from the deep structures which comprise their fundamental substance.</page><page sequence="2">14 Music Theory Spectrum reference Nattiez requires of it. After all, the mere fact of borrowing critical techniques, analytical tools, and terminol- ogy from the field of narratology does not entail a commit- ment to a narrative view of musical structure. On the other hand, studies mapping specific extramusical narratives onto musical works, such as Owen Jander's "Beethoven's 'Or- pheus in Hades': The Andante con moto of the Fourth Piano Concerto" are relatively rare in recent criticism.6 In short, musical narrativity has little to do with narrative. From a survey of the term's current usage one might, in fact, con- clude that it is merely a misleading placeholder standing for an elusive sense of teleology in the expressive or dramatic unfolding of musical works. Nevertheless, I believe it would be a mistake to dismiss the current debate out of hand be- cause, as William Kinderman has suggested, there is more at issue here than a difference of opinion on the vagaries of musical teleology.7 Like Kinderman, I believe the contro- versy is motivated by opposing conceptions of the relation between musical structure and content, and so manifests ten- sions with respect to fundamental aesthetic principles. The position of the radical narrativists is that structure is not an aspect of music that can fruitfully be explored in isolation from content and meaning; that structure and meaning-form and expression-are indecomposable aspects of musical works. Fred Everett Maus, for example, questions the very basis of this dichotomy, writing that "the received notion of musical 'structure,' as an aspect of music that can be dis- 619th-Century Music 8 (1985): 195-212. 7William Kinderman, "Narrative Design in Beethoven's Last Sonatas," meeting of the American Musicological Society, Pittsburgh, 1992. I refer to this paper rather than the published version in Beethoven Forum 1 because in it Kinderman was able to respond to newly published material by Nattiez and Kramer that was not available before the published version had gone to press. tinguished from 'meaning,' [is] vague and obscure."8 In a similar vein, Anthony Newcomb challenges one of its foun- dations, the notion that structure and content can be distin- guished on the basis of their relative primacy or ontological status. In "Sound and Feeling," an essay on musical expres- sion which deserves to be better known, he argues persua- sively that "formal and expressive interpretation are in fact two complementary ways of understanding the same phe- nomena. Neither is intrinsically closer than the other to the object."9 On a more practical level, Kinderman himself has noted that in some cases "study of the internal integration of pieces can hardly be separated from issues of artistic con- tent," while Leo Treitler has maintained that some crucial "questions of motivation"-those addressing why musical passages occur when and as they do-often yield only when structure is conceived in dramatic terms.10 Abbate, Nattiez, and Kramer, by contrast and in spite of their considerable contributions to the study of musical meaning and signifi- cation, endorse a formalist view on the issue of musical narrative-one in which "narrative content" is conceived not as part of the essential substance of musical works, but as a product of superfluous metaphor, rationalization, or super- ficial focus on details of the musical foreground. This article is aligned with the objectives of the narrat- ivists, whose enterprise might be summarized as the effort to integrate structural and semantic-expressive aspects of mu- sical works in the act of analysis by developing concepts ca- pable of functioning simultaneously in both domains. Musical plot, defined as the integrated formal and semantic content 8Fred Everett Maus, "Music as Drama," Music Theory Spectrum 10 (1988): 60. 9Anthony Newcomb, "Sound and Feeling," Critical Inquiry 10 (1984): 636.

The quest to formulate viable models of plot and so give shape to what is as yet only an intriguing abstraction, is among the more formidable challenges in contemporary music theory. The burden for anyone attempting such a formulation on the premise that structure and content are indecomposable is to demonstrate how one might account for the integration of formal and semantic-expressive aspects of musical works from the level of motives and phrases to that of entire move- ments or works. While little progress has yet been made toward such a comprehensive model, the nature of musical plot itself has been the subject of considerable speculation, much of it in- formed by structuralist literary theory. Maus, for example, invokes Tzvetan Todorov's concept of the ideal narrative in describing the plot he hears in the first seventeen measures of Beethoven's String Quartet in F Minor, op. 95; both An- thony Newcomb and Leo Treitler have compared the stan- dard formal patterns of music in the common practice period to paradigmatic plots of structuralist literary theory, propos- ing that meaning is a function of deviations from these patterns; Robin Wallace and Anthony Newcomb, following the lead of A. B. Marx and others, have located plots in sequences of mental states underlying musical structures; and James Webster has used "the form of tragedy" as a model for musical plot in Brahms's Tragic Overture-but all of these formulations, I believe, fall short of the idea's potential.t1 l1Maus's conception of plot in "Music as Drama" is problematic because it is applied to a short and palpably incomplete passage of a much larger movement, while Todorov's ideal plot structure was devised to describe the minimum requirements for plots in complete tales such as those in Boccaccio's Decameron. The formulations of Newcomb and Treitler dilute the notion of musical plot by equating it with the standard sequences of functional events in musical formal types. (Newcomb, "Schumann and Late Eighteenth- Only at the level of motives and phrases have the relations between formal and expressive qualities been explored sys- tematically, and this work has been carried out primarily by philosophers.12 This article sketches a model of musical plot based on structuralist principles designed to account for the relation between formal and semantic-expressive aspects of musical works from the level of motives to that of entire pieces. It is not a universal theory, however. Its purview is instrumental music composed in the framework of Romantic-expressive aesthetics-mostly works of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries- and about many works of this era it will have little to say. The argument comprises a relatively brief theoretical exposition and a longer practical demonstration, an analysis of the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in F Minor, op. 57. Before beginning, however, two foundational issues must be addressed briefly. First, what is entailed by the Century Narrative Strategies," 19th-Century Music 11 [1987]: 164-74; Treit- ler, "Mozart and the Idea of Absolute Music," in Music and the Historical Imagination [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1988]: 176-214). The approach shared by Wallace and Newcomb identifies plot types, including suffering followed by healing or redemption and struggle leading to victory, which are overly general (Newcomb, "Once More 'Between Absolute and Program Music': Schumann's Second Symphony," 19th-Century Music 7 [1984]: 233-50; Wallace, "Background and Expression in the First Movement of Beethoven's Op. 132," Journal of Musicology 7 [1989]: 3-20). Webster's analysis includes descriptions of extended non-dramatic scenes in which the tragic hero is lost in reminiscences and visions; what the work captures, therefore, is primarily the inner experience of a tragic persona and not the actual events of a drama ("Brahms's Tragic Overture: The Form of Tragedy," in Brahms, ed. Robert Pascal [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983]: 99-124). 12Peter Kivy's contour and convention theory of musical expression, cod- ified in The Corded Shell (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1980), is still a serviceable framework for discussions of these relations. Among recent work, Jerrold Levinson, Music, Art, and Metaphysics (Ithaca: Cornell Uni- versity Press, 1990), particularly the essay, "Aesthetic Supervenience," de- serves special mention.</page><page sequence="4">16 Music Theory Spectrum term plot; second, the nature of the relationship between musical plot and human experience. For the purposes of this article, the claim that a musical work is organized by a plot means (1) that some of its elements can be understood to rep- resent quasi-sentient agents and their actions,13 and (2) that the totality of such actions forms a complete and coherent unity coextensive with and inclusive of the entire musical unfolding. Under the model of musical plot proposed here, these con- ditions emerge as functions of music's internal relations-that is, without specific extramusical reference. Yet the precise nature of musical agents and actions and their significance in human terms depends nevertheless on how one conceives the fundamental relation between musical plots and human experience. Are such plots like the plans of narratives, told in the past tense, in which themes, motives, and other units behave as characters; are they like plots of stage dramas in which musical agents act and interact in the present without the mediation of a narrator; do they comprise sequences of experiential phenomena within a single consciousness- mental states and impressions, active cognitive processes, or struggles of opposing forces and voices in a consciousness divided; or do they relate to human experience in some al- together more abstract way? Each of these views entails a very different notion of mu- sical action and agency and of the relation of the listener to the ongoing process, and this is why it is important to arrive at a working model, at least, before specific issues of agency 13In using the term agent in this context, I follow the example set by Edward T. Cone in The Composer's Voice (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1974), though without invoking the elaborate typology he develops for this concept. I use the term in the most general sense to mean the source of an action or utterance and, like Cone, do not suggest that multiple human characters are represented in musical works. and action are broached. For example, the conception of music as stage drama suggests continuous action in objective time undertaken by independent agents, perceived by lis- teners who watch from outside the frame of the work. Music as psychological experience, on the other hand, mandates no determinate relation between the time of the embodied ex- perience and the objective time in which it is performed and heard. The action takes place within a single consciousness, and a listener may enter the frame of the work, imagining that the experience it embodies is his or her own experience. In attempting to narrow the field, a strict narrative view of mu- sical plot can be rejected because Abbate is correct in stating that music has no narrative past tense.'4 The notion of music as stage drama, as I have argued elsewhere, is problematic as well, first, because what is metaphorically called musical space is fundamentally disanalogous to space in the extra- musical world, second, because while musically embodied experience unfolds in the present tense, it is only rarely to be understood as unfolding in the objective time of extra- musical action.15 The view developed here, which in many ways parallels that formulated by Edward T. Cone in The Composer's Voice, is that musical plots are dramas of mental life comprising affective, perceptual, and cognitive impressions. These im- pressions unfold in the present tense, though not in objective time, each musical moment embodying indeterminate but '4As I have argued in "The Temporal Life of the Musical Persona: Im- plications for Narrative and Dramatic Interpretation" (Music Research Forum 6 [1991]: 42-72), however, a narrative view of musical structure, even if it must ultimately be rejected, captures the character of the temporal rela- tionship between human experience and the musical unfolding embodying it better than accounts of music as stage drama.

The principal musical ideas, usually themes and motives, are associated with forces and impressions of mental life and musical plots play out the interaction of such forces and impressions in the manner of an allegory. Thus a particular composition will likely not correspond to any particular sequence of mental events, either real or imaginary, but to an idealized fiction of mental life unfolding in the mind of an unspecified per- sona.16 How such fictions take on musical form can best be explained, I believe, in the terms of a diffuse intellectual movement or approach to inquiry known as structuralism. ANALYTIC STRATEGIES Over the last century or so, structuralist thinkers have made substantial contributions to the fields of phonology, linguistics, anthropology, literary theory, and art criticism.17 The project of structuralist inquiry in each of these fields has been to map systems of meaning underlying relations among semantically relevant units, whether phonemes, morphemes, totemic classifications, or abstract narrative roles and func- tions. In so doing, structuralists have followed two guiding principles. The first is to "concentrate not on the substantive characteristics of individual phenomena but on abstract dif- 16This concept, first used and theorized in a musical context by Edward T. Cone in The Composer's Voice, derives from the literary theory of the so-called New Critical movement. Cone defines the musical persona as "the experiencing subject of [an] entire composition, in whose thought the play, narrative, or reverie takes place-whose inner life the music communicates by means of symbolic gesture" (The Composer's Voice, 1). I use the term in the same sense, though I do not conceive the inner life of the persona as closely analogous to a play, narrative, or reverie. l7The literature is simply too extensive to summarize here. General sur- veys with comprehensive bibliographies appear in Jonathan Culler, Struc- turalist Poetics (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1975) and Terrence Hawkes, Structuralism and Semiotics (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1977). ferential features which [can] be defined in relational terms."18 For the structuralists, then, the meaning of any particular unit is determined primarily by its relation to other units in a system and not by its intrinsic characteristics. Sec- ond is the tendency to use a binary model in analyzing the relations among phenomena in a system. As Jonathan Culler observes, "structuralists have generally followed [Roman] Jakobson and taken the binary opposition as a fundamental operation of the human mind basic to the production of meaning."19 The principal semantic unit proposed in this ar- ticle is a species of binary opposition of the same logical form as those linking characters and their foils in literature. This species of opposition, by its very structure, I claim, is the key to solving the fundamental problems of musical semantics which any model of musical plot must confront. A brief sketch of the workings of literary foils, illustrated with an example from a novel by Dostoyevsky, introduces the binary pattern for which I claim such prodigious semantic potential. For one character to act as a foil to another, three con- ditions must be met. First, there must be parallels in life circumstances, personal history, appearance, or the like marking the relation between two characters for special at- tention, inviting readers to compare them critically. Second, there must be differential features of their character, behav- ior, or fortunes-differentia-which the underlying parallels set in relief. Third, a certain semantic burden must be met; examining differentia in light of the underlying parallels must have a payoff, yielding insight into the motivation of the principal character, the moral order of a given social struc- ture, the ideology of the author, and so forth. In Dosto- yevsky's Crime and Punishment, Razumikhin is an apt foil for Rodion Raskolnikov because both are impoverished students living in squalor in nineteenth-century St. Petersburg. These 18Culler, Structuralist Poetics, 7. '9Ibid., 15.</page><page sequence="6">18 Music Theory Spectrum parallels in life circumstances set their contrasting outlooks and behavior (differentia) in special relief; Razumikhin re- mains irrepressibly optimistic and honestly employed while Raskolnikov sinks into depression and commits robbery and double murder. We only understand this binary opposition as that of a principal character and one of his foils, however, because the pairing is richly instructive; examining their out- looks and behavior in light of their shared circumstances yields insight into Raskolnikov's motivation and the author's ideology.20 Without the counterbalance of Razumikhin, the reader might, for example, be inclined to interpret Raskol- nikov's crime simplistically, as a response to his poverty and as Dostoyevsky's indictment of contemporary social condi- tions. The presence of a foil who optimistically meets the same conditions and prospers forestalls such conclusions, fo- cusing the reader's attention more profitably on Raskolnikov as the victim of a misbegotten idea and his Napoleonic as- pirations. Thus we describe a character as a foil to another if there are objective parallels marking the relation between them for special attention and if contrasting their character, behavior, or fortunes in light of their underlying identity yields thematically significant inferences. In the analysis below, the term foil is used to describe musical elements standing in meaningful relations of identity and contrast to other elements. My usage, however, does not wholly parallel the term's common usage in literary criticism. Specifically, the concept is extended to cover relations be- tween different versions of the same theme or motive, a prac- tice that is like describing the repentant Raskolnikov from the end of Crime and Punishment as a foil to his former self. However, this minor modification of a familiar concept is 20Actually, for the Russian reader, the foil interpretation is also suggested by the names Raskolnikov and Razumikhin themselves, for they are seman- tically loaded in the same way that the proper names of many of Dickens's characters are for English readers; in Russian the noun raskol means split or schism while the adjective razumnij means reasonable or sensible. more economical than the alternatives of inventing a new term or using a cumbersome construction like "counterpart in a relation of mutually elucidating identity and contrast." Organizing musical works in patterns of simultaneous identity and contrast like those linking characters and their foils, I believe, is a first step in solving the most daunting semantic problem facing any model of musical plot: how the relatively specific dramatic content implied by the notion of plot is to be ascribed to works of so-called absolute music when the expressive and other semantically relevant qualities of their component passages, considered in isolation, can be specified only in general terms. The secret is in the mech- anism by which relations between foils, by their very form, communicate meaning beyond that inscribed by the author or narrator, imbuing straightforward and seemingly insignif- icant traits of character with profound symbolic and ethical force. Razumikhin's optimism, for example, is, in and of itself, no more than the unquestioning faith of a simple na- ture. In the context of his relation of identity and contrast with Raskolnikov, however, it becomes an object lesson in the virtue of spiritual simplicity, an indictment of our hero's world view, and an unwitting mockery of his self-absorbed struggle "to get a thought straight."21 And this semantic sur- plus comes without a single extra word from the author and, indeed, without any specific verbal trace whatever; it is in- ferred merely from the structure of the relation of identity and opposition linking the two characters. Relations of si- multaneous identity and contrast in music too possess, by their very form, a powerful semantic potential, though nec- essarily restricted by the elusive significance of the passages they unite. For the semantic and expressive qualities we can reasonably attribute to passages of absolute music in isola- 21Alyosha Karamazov uses this phrase in describing his brother Ivan in The Brothers Karamazov, trans.

When such relations of identity and opposition are system- atically developed over the course of an entire composition, we have the stuff of which plots are made. Exploring how musical analogs of foils and other oppo- sitions are systematically developed as elements of plot re- quires two further constructs, roles and functions, drawn, appropriately enough, from the structuralist theory of plot. Both are lucidly formulated in a pioneering work of struc- turalist literary theory, Vladimir Propp's Morphology of the Folktale (1928). In this study of one hundred Russian fairy tales, Propp notes a "two-fold quality of the folktale: it is amazingly multiform, picturesque, and colorful, and, to no less a degree, remarkably uniform and recurrent."23 The pic- turesque and colorful details are superficial manifestations of a small number of recurrent elements called roles and func- 22A discussion of musical expression as isomorphism with human expres- sive behaviors appears in Kivy, The Corded Shell. Discussions of topics appear in Leonard G. Ratner, Classic Music (New York: Schirmer Books, 1980) and V.

Laurence Scott, The International Journal of American Linguistics 24 (1958): 19. tions. Roles are idealized character types, recurring from tale to tale, which can be filled by a number of more or less interchangeable beings. The role of villain, for example, may be played equally well by a giant, a bandit, a witch, a step- mother, or some other unsavory entity. The central elements of tales, those forming the structural skeletons of plots, are functions. Propp describes a function as "an act of dramatis personae, which is defined from the point of view of its sig- nificance for the course of action of the tale as a whole . . . Functions serve as stable, constant elements in folktales, in- dependent of who performs them, and how they are fulfilled by the dramatis personae."24 The function, villainy, for ex- ample, can take the form of a murder, an abduction, the stealing of a magic agent, the throwing of someone into the sea, or any number of other dastardly acts, but its significance in the course of the tale as a whole is independent of the details of its specific manifestation. As a function it motivates the actions of the hero, who eventually, after intervening functions, attempts to counteract it. The notion of abstract roles requires no introduction in the field of music criticism; it is a common practice to refer to the principal theme of a movement, particularly a movement in sonata form, as its protagonist, and nearly as common to use the term antagonist or some equivalent to refer to ele- ments at odds with the principal material.25 In my analysis of the Appassionata I add one further role with less precedent in the critical literature. The real innovation in this article, 24Ibid., 20. 25Studies in which both roles are postulated include Patricia Carpenter, "Grundgestalt as Tonal Function," Music Theory Spectrum 7 (1985): 15-38; Philip G. Downs, "Beethoven's 'New Way' and the Eroica," in The Creative World of Beethoven, ed. Paul Henry Lang (New York: W. W. Norton, 1970), 83-102; and Susan McClary, "Sexual Politics in Classical Music," in Feminine Endings (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1991), 53-79.</page><page sequence="8">20 Music Theory Spectrum however, is a system of musical plot functions indebted in a general way to Propp's thinking and adapted to the theory of musical actions.26 In the analysis which follows, a distinction is made be- tween two kinds of actions, the first not unlike common- place actions of everyday life-outbursts, interjections, sobs, flights, hammer-strokes, slides, leaps, climbs, and other mo- tions and gestures of isolated agents. Actions in this category, which are the basis of Maus's theory of musical action as developed in "Music as Drama," play a relatively minor role in this article, helping to characterize agents cast in abstract dramatic roles. Actions in the second category, defined much as Propp defines functions, are the fundamental units of plots like the one I describe underlying the first movement of the Appassionata. Because they are defined as Propp defines functions, that is, "from the point of view of their significance for the course of action of the [work] as a whole," actions of this kind are, I believe, a more promising basis for analyses of plot at the level of complete movements than the everyday actions Maus favors.27 Called functional sequences, they are 26Most of my functions actually bear little practical resemblance to Propp's, sharing only the principles embodied in his definition of the concept. Any attempt to adapt his actual system of thirty-one functions for use in musical analysis would have been fruitless in any case because most of them are simply too concrete (e.g., "XIV. The Hero Acquires the Use of a Magical Agent") and in the body of literature he analyzes they always occur in a rigidly prescribed order. 27The danger in Maus's approach, if one can judge based on his analysis of a seventeen-measure fragment, is that it can lead to an atomistic account of plot. The three principal actions he hears in the opening of Beethoven's Quartet in F Minor, op. 95, for example, are built from materials which recur in various guises throughout the movement, establishing comprehensive pat- terns of behavior with respect to one another and perhaps even dramatically consistent roles. In his analysis, however, these comprehensive patterns are not acknowledged in explaining the motivations of agents within the opening. Consequently, one must wonder how the isolated actions of the first seventeen measures would be reconciled to the course of action of the work as a whole. The strategy is analogous to attempting to explain the motivations of char- acters in a novel on the basis of information revealed in the first chapter alone. actions in the abstract undertaken by one agent with respect to another, and the terms by which they are described here- enclosure, disruption, subversion, counteraction, interruption, integration, divergence, withdrawal, realization, and trans- figuration reflect something of their abstract character. For now, only those encountered in the Appassionata anal- ysis need be defined; the legend in Figure 1 can be consulted for further clarification. Enclosure refers to a sequence in which an agent is, within a closed unit of structure, directly preceded and followed by material playing an opposing role or representing a contrasting state; enclosures are often like verbal exchanges between two parties in which the first to speak also has the final word, refuting or sweeping aside an objection interposed by an adversary. The opening of Beethoven's Eroica is a paradigm example of enclosure. The enclosed element is the third clause of the principal theme (mm. 23-36), whose syncopated duple divisions have been interpreted by several writers as an antagonistic force in the movement as a whole.28 The principal material of the theme, representing the thematic protagonist of the movement, precedes this passage and then follows it with redoubled strength, enclosing the antagonistic element, establishing its own heroic character in the very act of confrontation and reassertion. The term enclosure invokes the familiar spatial metaphor of a work unfolding from left to right, so that if one imagines the phrase structure of the opening of the Eroica diagrammed as A (mm. 1-14), A' (15-22), B (23-36), A" (37-45), the enclosure is visually apparent. The term dis- ruption refers to a pattern resembling a failed enclosure in which the element to be enclosed proves uncontainable. Here the first agent still has the final word but its attempt at ref- utation rings hollow, betrays weakness, or ends in failure. The opening of the Appassionata, as explained in the analysis 28Chapter 2 of Scott Burnham, Beethoven Hero (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1995) discusses the long tradition of programmatic inter- pretations of this movement.</page><page sequence="9">Structuralism and Musical Plot 21 Figure 1.

Counteraction, the only function proposed here with a direct counterpart in Propp's system, describes a measure taken to counter the effects of a prior enclosure, disruption, or subversion. Realization is the bringing about of a desired state or the fulfillment of a threat. Withdrawal refers to an introversive counteraction-a retreat from conflict; interrup- tion is self-explanatory. I believe that functional sequences enacted by musical agents cast in abstract dramatic roles reflect a fundamental mode of organization in works like Beethoven's Appassionata, while providing the basis for a typology of musical plots with broad implications for the crit- icism of nineteenth- and twentieth-century music and the his- tory of style in this era. The analysis which follows shows how roles and functional sequences can be heard to arise from interlocking patterns of binary oppositions akin to literary foils, and how a series of functional sequences might be linked to form a complete and coherent plot. ANALYSIS In examining the opening of Beethoven's Appassionata, one is confronted with a number of binary oppositions that might be analyzed as musical-dramatic elements and their foils. This analysis begins with the relation between the first four measures and their thrice interrupted restatement in mm. 17-23, because in a passage replete with striking ex- cesses and extravagant gestures, this restatement of the opening phrase is the most extravagant of all, and hence a promising nexus for interpretation. The restatement makes a special point of preserving each measure of its foil intact and at a restrained dynamic level, and this apparent attempt to recapture the composure of the opening is cast in special relief by the violence of the three ff outbursts interrupting its progress (mm. 17-18, 20, and 22). But the full significance of this treatment of the opening phrase is only apparent when the contrasting aspects of the model and restatement are ex- amined in light of their underlying identity. Considered apart from its foil, the restatement is an oddly timed passage marked by striking dynamic and textural contrasts, features suggesting extreme expression and a tendency toward dis- continuity. Considered in relation to its foil, however, it takes on a far more specific significance: in this context it is a well- balanced four-measure phrase mangled or dismembered. Sounding just seventeen measures from the opening, this bru- talization of the principal phrase is enigmatic-an outrageous effect in search of a cause, inviting the listener to search for an explanation or causal agent. I suggest that the explanation is in the intervening measures and that the cause is the in- tervention of an antagonistic force embodied in the four-note descending motive from Db to C (henceforth, motive X) which first sounds in m. 10. (This statement is made from the point of view of the fictional world of the work. It would be closer to the truth to say that the structural function of the passage is to focus the listener's attention on motive X in order to mark it for a particular structural-expressive role in the overall plan. The illusion of causation is thus exploited to achieve a structural goal.) A detailed examination of the passage focusing on how motive X is introduced and how it interacts with the other elements of the theme-designated collectively as the thematic protagonist-supports this inter- pretation. Before proceeding, however, it is necessary to explain carefully how the ascription of dramatic roles like protagonist and antagonist to the movement's themes and motives is to</page><page sequence="11">Structuralism and Musical Plot 23 be reconciled with the overriding conception of the work as a drama of mental life unfolding in the experience of a unitary persona. First and foremost, these roles do not represent independent characters, but should be understood as abstract personifications of opposing forces, impressions, and struc- tures within the psyche of the persona. The terms protagonist and antagonist were chosen because of their precedent in music criticism and because they are relatively neutral labels for the elements of such a dramatic opposition. The element designated as the protagonist embodies the persona's will to action and the seat of its identity, and for this reason it is the element to which the fortunes of the persona are most closely linked. It is largely true, therefore, that as the protagonist fares, so too fares the persona. The two terms are not in- terchangeable, however, since the persona's experience en- compasses all of the work's forces and actions both fair and foul, while the term protagonist denotes only the material of the principal theme (exclusive of motive X). The antagonistic motive might be understood as the persona's mental repre- sentation of an extrapersonal force or as some aspect of the self perceived as foreign or inimical to the persona's in- terests.29 Motive X, then, enters in m. 10 as a foreign element in the texture, a distinct second voice differentiated from the protagonist's voice by its register, its strong rhythmic profile, and its dialogic relationship to the principal motives. It is well cast for an antagonistic role. Its low register and semitonal descent lend it an ominous or sinister quality, and its gravity and inflexible insistence in its three repetitions signal author- ity and elemental power. Equally important is its role in de- fining the root of a lengthy dominant elaboration, for in this 29For this strategy I am once again indebted to Cone, who in The Com- poser's Voice uses it in accounting for some of the vivid details of Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique. capacity it creates a high level of expectation for an inevitable resolution. Integrating these observations yields a sinister and single-minded agent promising an unavoidable outcome-in other words, a threat or warning. The first time the malev- olent message is stated, in m. 10, it goes unheard-the pro- tagonist continues in self-absorbed dalliance with the trill motive. With the second statement in m. 12 the protagonist hears, but either does not understand or requires clarifica- tion: it repeats the antagonist's words with a rising, ques- tioning inflection. To be absolutely sure the threat is under- stood, the antagonist slows its speech (the poco ritardando of mm. 12-13) and pronounces the fateful words once again. The protagonist understands this time, repeating what it has heard and responding with a violent outburst in mm. 13-14. Whether this gesture and the subsequent fragmentation of the thematic protagonist express rage, fear, defiance, grief, confusion, or some other emotion or state is impossible to know at this point.30 For now it is enough to recognize that the threat or warning has had a disruptive influence on the protagonist, performing the function of disruption in the structuralist system proposed here. Of course, the interaction described above is only a sim- ulation of dramatic dialogue, and in fact there is no need to ascribe specific meanings to the voices. The function of the passage is fulfilled merely by its structural similarity to a dra- matic dialogue, and it is this similarity which is exploited in 30If A. B. Marx is right in hearing rage in this passage ("Derselbe Satz wiederholt sich, wieder leis' anhebend, aber mit schmetterndem Einschlag der Harmonie dreimal mit Wuth unterbrochen" (Ludwig van Beethoven: Leben und Schaffen, Vol. 2 [Berlin: Verlag von Otto Janke, 1863-64], 27), I would suggest that it is rage of a special kind. It is like a storm one raises in one's own mind to drown out unwelcome thoughts, in this case the warning or threat of motive X. Perhaps it succeeds-after all, motive X is not heard in the restatement-but if so, the success has had a price; the persona's peace of mind has been shattered.</page><page sequence="12">24 Music Theory Spectrum accomplishing a crucial structural goal. The causal link drawn between the entry of motive X and the disruption of the principal ideas that follows in mm. 17-23 create distinct and ultimately stable dramatic roles for two principal thematic elements, establishing an antagonist-protagonist opposition which becomes one of the principal subjects of development throughout the movement.31 The second theme can be heard as a foil to the first because it is derived from the movement's opening motive in a way that is clearly audible, and yet diametrically contrasts with the first theme in a number of its formal and expressive qualities. The rhythmic similarities connecting the themes are obvious, as are the shared emphasis on tonic (of their respective keys) arpeggiation and neighbor motions-but the contrasts are more striking. The first theme, as discussed above, is volatile and active, quite literally the protagonist confronting an an- tagonistic force. The second is serene, emerging only after all echoes of conflict have faded. It is contemplative and unified in effect rather than active and divided among multiple agents like its counterpart-thus, a soliloquy or lyrical mood picture rather than a dramatic scene. It is set off from the turmoil of the first theme area and from the agitated closing that follows by a parenthesis of transitional material and because it is the only hint of the mediant major in an exposition dominated by the minor mode. What is the significance of its relation to the first theme? The most obvious interpretation 31Robert Hatten explores the notion of a thematic opposition acting as a theme for development in an analysis of the first movement of Beethoven's String Quartet, op. 130: "If issues of rhythmic ambiguity . . . and thematic/ textural/tempo oppositions are, in the best Classical sense, significant themes of the movement, then their working out may involve strategies that, in their tonal/structural consequences, go beyond the basic expectations of the style ("Aspects of Dramatic Closure in Beethoven: A Semiotic Perspective on Musical Analysis via Strategies of Dramatic Conflict," Semiotica 66 (1987): 200.) is that it represents a state of the work's persona diametrically contrasting with that embodied by its foil, and if this is so, then we have once again been set an enigma. Like the relation of varied restatement and opening phrase examined above, the expressive gulf separating the two principal themes, cast in relief as it is by their underlying identity, stands as an effect in search of a cause. One must explain what has happened to console or restore the composure of the persona, given the chaos that had so recently prevailed in the opening theme. As above, clues can be found in the intervening material. The transitional phrases connecting the two principal themes (mm. 24-35) elaborate a single harmony, V/III, while maintaining an unwavering pulse in eighth notes. The first two evenly-balanced four-measure phrases echo the dramatic conflict embodied in the first theme. Each culminates in its third measure with a sforzando on the flatted-sixth scale de- gree of the new key which descends in the final measure to the fifth degree, recalling the 1 6-5 motion of motive X. Over- all, however, the contour of the passage is a gradual dimin- uendo and descent to a lower register and level of tension-a softening and broadening that settles in m. 35 into a deep and quiescent pool of mediant major. The action taken in the transition, then, is a turning inward-a withdrawal-and finally, a submersion into thoughts or impressions sheltered from the threats and chaos of the opening scene. The role played by the second theme might therefore be described as an ideal, contemplative state of the persona. What is the nature of the ideal state embodied in the second theme? By examining some of its salient formal and expressive features-that is, those thrown into relief by its foil, the first theme-one can narrow the range of interpre- tations. Perhaps in highest relief is its major-modal colora- tion. It is the only extended passage of the exposition in the major mode, which, given conventional affective interpre- tations of the modes, invites interpretations at the brighter end of the expressive continuum. Also in sharp relief is the</page><page sequence="13">Structuralism and Musical Plot 25 passage's near stasis. The three two-measure units with which it begins are rhythmically identical and firmly centered on the mediant harmony; its melodic structure (A, A', A) might be described as three repetitions of the same shape with the barest minimum of internal contrast, or as an oscillation between two nearly identical statements. In anthropomorphic terms, one might say that it manifests no impulse to change -to move beyond the single image which is its subject or the single harmony grounding it-and therefore, no sense of for- ward motion or striving. Integrating these observations yields a general interpretation: the opening clauses of the second theme are pleasurable and static, suggesting human states like restfulness, peace, or contentment. But this interpretation is incomplete, for it fails to capture a cruel irony defining the theme's role in the plot as a whole; that is, the very features creating its restful and contented impression-its harmonic and rhythmic stasis, its oscillation between two nearly iden- tical statements-also render it unsustainable. The theme is simply too static and repetitive to invite a broader exposition. In any event, the pleasant, if short-lived, impression of the second theme is cast in a new light by events set in motion in m. 42. The descending third Fl -Db, in m. 42 cuts short the pre- vailing serenity of the second theme by echoing the last mo- tive of its principal clause in the minor mode and at forte. Now it is part of the nature of states like contentment and serenity that they require time to be savored. A flash of rage, a twinge of wistfulness, a moment of ecstatic joy; these are unproblematic, but fleeting contentment is nearly a contra- diction in terms. The essence of contentment can only be experienced as an enduring phenomenon, and it is for this reason that the interruption of the nascent contentment in m. 42 is essential to the second theme's meaning. The isolated descending third of m. 42, appended as it is to a pattern of more complete statements, sounds like an uneasy after- thought or doubt, foretelling a change in the fortunes of the persona, signaling a return to reality through its move to the mediant minor, the key of the closing. The first step in this return, the note Fb, is the flatted-sixth scale degree in the new key-the degree defining the antagonistic motive X which is soon to reappear prominently at the climax of the closing theme as Fb moving to Eb. The allusions to the antagonist which cut it short, along with its brevity, suggest that the ideal state of the second theme is not contentment with a tangible reality in the experience of the persona, but rather an ephem- eral vision. If the transition preceding the second theme was a turning away from the outside world leading to immersion in a fleet- ing dream state, the closing which follows is the return jour- ney, a re-emergence into the real world of conflict introduced in the first theme. Moreover, this symmetrical contrast of immersion and emergence is underscored by parallels in structure and content and so stands as another illustration of the role foils can be heard to play in the structure and mean- ing of the exposition. Like the transition, the closing material (mm. 51-66) begins with two four-measure phrases, each culminating in an allusion to motive X, followed by a fore- shortening (or liquidation) in subsequent phrases. But instead of the transition's relatively calm eighth-note pulse and fading echoes of motive X, in the closing we find a frenetic pace and motive X at fortissimo surging out of the depths on the crest of a rising arpeggiation of vii?7. In addition to its relation to the transition and motive X, the closing material also recalls the protagonist through its emphasis on the submediant and Neapolitan harmonies. Thus, one could say that it exhibits the kind of simultaneous multiple agency characterizing the sonata's opening. What then is the role of the closing in the plot of the exposition? It confirms the conflict of protagonist and antagonist as the primary issue of the drama and, by cutting short the contented impressions of the second theme, confirms that the ideal envisioned by the persona is an iso- lated and seemingly distant hope. The action it performs with</page><page sequence="14">26 Music Theory Spectrum respect to the second theme is enclosure; it encloses the single hopeful moment in a structure dominated by impressions of turmoil generated by the influence of motive X. So by the end of the exposition three abstract dramatic roles-protagonist, antagonist, and goal state-have been taken by its themes and motives, and two problems moti- vating the rest of the movement's action have been posed. First is the threat of motive X, which, after its introduction in m. 10, occupies the thoughts of the musical persona more or less continuously throughout the exposition. Second is the unrealized ideal envisioned in the second theme. The rest of the movement explores these dramatic problems, which prove to be related. Throughout the movement, the principal concern of the persona is to bring into tangible and enduring reality the ideal state envisioned in the second theme. Each attempt to do so, however, is thwarted by the intervention of motive X, which grows in power and influence as the move- ment progresses. The exposition has ended in the key of Ab minor, the mediant minor of the movement's tonic, with the antagonistic element, motive X, in a position of power attained through its disruption of the thematic protagonist and enclosure of the second theme into a larger structure in which it is the dom- inant factor. In the development, however, the protagonist challenges its position. The development begins (m. 67) in the tonal netherworld of Fb major, spelled enharmonically as E major, a region far removed from the movement's tonic and one beholden to the Ab minor established as part of motive X's sphere of influence in the closing. (Fb major arises as the submediant of Ab minor.) All of the material in Fb major comes from the first theme, though the opening arpeggiated motive sounds only in the first two measures. When the open- ing motive returns in m. 79, however, performing the function of counteraction, the struggle is begun in earnest. There is a sudden change to a forte dynamic level, a sudden increase in rhythmic activity, and a sudden move to the minor mode, all creating an effect of heightened tension. The motive passes from hand to hand, beginning in the left hand in mm. 79-80 and then continuing in the right hand in mm. 81-82, in this way covering a span of more than four octaves over the course of four measures, while the accompanying figuration, which crosses it in a descending direction, covers nearly three. By this hand-over-hand grappling (metaphorically, that is; not on the part of the pianist), the protagonist extricates itself from the tonal netherworld of Fb minor, moving through a mod- ulating sequential pattern by minor sixths until it arrives on firmer ground, the dominant of Db, in m. 91. It is tempting to ascribe a special significance to this pattern of modulation by a chain of submediant relations, given that the key of the submediant itself, Db, holds a certain symbolic status in the sonata as a whole. It is in the key of the submediant, for example, that the persona twice attempts unsuccessfully to project the goal state envisioned in the second theme: the first attempt is in the development beginning at m. 109, the second is the parallel passage in the coda in mm. 210ff. Moreover, the second movement, the serene Andante con moto, unfolds entirely in the key of the submediant, establishing Dl major once and for all as a realm of the ideal. Finally, the antagonist can be interpreted in light of this symbolism as well, since its semitonal descent from Db perennially drags the submediant back into the conflicted axis of dominant and tonic. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the transition from the second movement to the finale, where D b as tonic suddenly becomes Db as the submediant of F minor and is then pulled down to C in an expansion of motive X, setting the tragic finale in motion. Given these symbolic associations, it is singularly appropriate that the immediate tonal goal of the protagonist's first counteraction in the opening movement, the key of the submediant, should itself be reached by a straining spiral of submediant relations. By this ingenious escape from the tonal netherworld of Fb, the protagonist counteracts the tonal ef- fects of the antagonist's dominance of the exposition, winning</page><page sequence="15">Structuralism and Musical Plot 27 a respite in which the persona pursues the ideal envisioned in the second theme. The second theme as it sounds in the development (m. llOff.) derives its meaning from its relation to its foil, the original statement in the exposition, a relation which might be described as a compound irony. While in the original state- ment the very features creating a restful and contented im- pression are precisely those rendering it unsustainable, in the development, the features allowing it to be sustained beyond its original length undercut the restful and contented qualities which were its expressive essence. Preserved is the pattern of oscillation between rhythmically-identical two-measure units followed by a foreshortening on the final motive. But this familiar pattern is subverted by new features undercutting the theme's placid impression, including a modulating progres- sion with an accelerating harmonic rhythm and an overall dynamic contour which could be described as a series of increasingly intense crescendos. The dilemma of the persona is captured perfectly by the interaction of these two sets of features. In the exposition, the theme had to be cut short because its static pattern of oscillation would have been un- tenable had it continued longer than the cycle and a half (three units) it in fact completed. In the development, how- ever, restless harmonic motion allows it a longer life. As the oscillation continues and is followed by its foreshortening, more potent harmonic solutions, including the move to B minor begun in m. 113, are offered to counteract the inertia of continued repetition. After two and a half cycles-which is about as far as harmonic variation alone can sustain the pattern of repetition-the liquidation begins in m. 120 with an acceleration of harmonic rhythm. The restatements of the final motive which follow are like a desperate effort to hold ground-to sustain the ideal state in the face of increasing opposition. In m. 123 the image is shattered, the shards and sparks thrown upward in the arpeggiation of vii?7 and then showering downward until motive X is ferociously hammered out in mm. 130-33. Whatever threat or warning the antag- onist had delivered at its first appearance is abundantly ful- filled in this catastrophe, and the effects on the persona are soon indexed in the treatment of the principal theme in the recapitulation. Before proceeding to the recapitulation, however, a few prefatory words are necessary. Recapitulations and other ex- tended formal repetitions have posed a perennial dilemma for narrative and stage-dramatic accounts of musical structures because the architectonic requirements they satisfy in music have no counterparts in narrative literature or drama. Con- sequently, musically satisfying repetitions are often found to be dramatically superfluous, and have been discounted, ra- tionalized, or simply left unacknowledged in interpretations of musical plot. Perhaps the most familiar rationalization is one Philip Downs used a quarter of a century ago in his dramatic analysis of the first movement of Beethoven's Ero- ica. That part of the movement for which Downs was unable to identify an integral dramatic role, including extended pas- sages in the exposition and development and most of the recapitulation and coda, was dismissed as serving a purely musical function. The function of the coda, for example, he found to be "virtually entirely formal," merely fulfilling the "sonata principle of recapitulation."32 Needless to say, this tactic is dangerously arbitrary because it allows one to dis- count any passage impeaching the author's interpretation as a concession to formal requirements.33 32Philip G. Downs, "Beethoven's 'New Way' and the Eroica," in The Creative World of Beethoven, ed. Paul Henry Lang (New York: W. W. Norton, 1970), 86. 33Carolyn Abbate, in discussing the narrative interpretation of Ducas's L'Apprenti sorcier, characterizes a similar strategy as an "interpretive escape route," observing that "when a motif's appearance seems contradictory in terms of its symbolic force, it will be stripped of its symbolic meaning. Its recurrence is written off to the exigencies of purely musical logic" ("What the Sorcerer Said," 224).</page><page sequence="16">28 Music Theory Spectrum It is an open question, however, whether those who have confronted the problem more directly have had greater suc- cess. Edward T. Cone, in a hermeneutic study of Schubert's Moment musical, op. 94 no. 6, meets it head-on, offering a comprehensive strategy for interpreting formal repetitions. According to Cone, the opening section of this ternary work embodies a tragic sequence of events, dramatizing "the in- jection of a strange, unsettling element into an otherwise peaceful situation. At first ignored or suppressed, that ele- ment persistently returns. It not only makes itself at home but even takes over the direction of events in order to reveal unsuspected possibilities."34 In explaining why this dramatic sequence is repeated da capo after the Trio, he suggests that in the mind of the work's persona, "the memory of the original course of events is bound to recur," an interpretation reflecting his general view that "formal repetitions are often best interpreted as repre- sentations of events rehearsed in memory."35 As a strategy for interpreting exact repetitions, this all too convenient so- lution is problematic in at least two respects. First, to accept it is to accept that in some cases the rehearsal in memory of a sequence of events is indistinguishable from the actual ex- perience of living through it-something we know to be un- true in everyday life. Second, if one accepts Cone's expla- nation with respect to Schubert's Moment musical, then one must be willing to accept that all dramatic ternary works ending with exact repetitions of their opening sections rep- resent sequences of events followed after a digression by their precise and vivid rehearsal in memory. The problem with this interpretive strategy is that while it may be plausible as an account of an isolated work, it is bound to seem fetishistic applied to ten. But however one rates Cone's solution as an 34Edward T. Cone, "Schubert's Promissory Note: An Exercise in Musical Hermeneutics," 19th-Century Music 5 (1982): 239. 35Ibid., 240. account of exact repetitions, I believe that it nevertheless has considerable merit in the interpretation of varied repetitions, including the recapitulation of the opening theme in the first movement of Beethoven's Appassionata. Continuing the analysis: After the catastrophe of the re- transition, the Appassionata's opening scene is replayed mea- sure for measure in the right hand beginning in m. 136, and it is this part of the texture which I interpret as the persona's reconstruction of earlier events. Why reconstruction rather than mere repetition? The reason is the nature of the relation between this passage and its foil in the exposition. In the recapitulation nearly every aspect of the theme's subtly- nuanced expression is undercut by the addition of a single new feature, the pedal point underlying the first period, and as a result, the original course of events, though followed step by step, is stripped of its immediacy and emotional con- text. Among the seemingly contradictory qualities subverted by the pedal point are, on one hand, a sense of calm self- possession arising from the theme's deliberate and careful unfolding (in mm. 1-8) and stability and solidity proceeding from its root-position harmonies (first F minor and then Gl major) and squarely symmetrical phrasing; on the other, a certain willfulness and elusiveness revealed in sudden, un- prepared shifts to distant tonal terrain, and a fragmentary and halting impression created by its frequent pauses. In the re- capitulation, the agitation of the incessantly reiterated pedal tone shatters the calm, overshadowing the deliberate motion of the right hand while welding the formerly fragmentary scene into a single curve of force. The stability and solidity of the opening phrases are undercut because the pedal point grounds the last half of a lengthy dominant prolongation (mm. 122-51), transforming what was a firm tonic harmony in the first measure of the sonata into a mere neighbor chord within a prolonged dominant at the onset of the recapitulation (m. 136), thus destabilizing the entire first period. In the exposition, the willful and elusive character of the thematic</page><page sequence="17">Structuralism and Musical Plot 29 protagonist, apparent in its sudden shifts to and from the area of the Neapolitan, depends on an element of surprise that is lost in the recapitulation. The shifts at the beginnings of the second and third phrases (mm. 4-5 and 8-9), for example, come after silences which obscure any sense of linear con- nection, the protagonist simply appearing in will-o'-the-wisp fashion in new regions. In the recapitulation, however, the move to the Neapolitan is anticipated by the ascent of the pedal point to Db in m. 139, while the move back to the dominant is given away by the B in the bass in m. 143.36 It is by undercutting all of these expressive qualities and im- parting its more or less uniform agitation to the entire first period that the pedal point strips the passage of its immediacy and emotional context, homogenizing or flattening its ex- pressive contours. It is as though the events of the earlier drama are remembered clearly, but monochromatically col- ored by the intense affective experience of a later time in which they are recalled, the effect very much like the dis- tancing we sometimes experience when reconstructing a scene in our imaginations. Note, however, that it is only the persona's impressions of the past which are subject to emo- tional distancing. The persona's experience in the present is of unprecedented vividness. A good way to integrate these observations is to describe the passage from the climactic retransition (m. 130) through the recapitulation of the principal theme's first period (m. 36The addition of the B transforms what in the exposition had been a submediant harmony into a more dominant-directed chord of the diminished third (B, D6, F, Ab in m. 143). Although this change might be interpreted superficially as a mere concession to correct voice-leading, since the B in the bass replaces Db to avoid parallel octaves, what is crucial here is the way Beethoven, like any great artist, turns a mere necessity to aesthetic account. By giving away the move to and increasing the gravitation toward the dom- inant, the B serves the same function as the anticipation of Db four measures earlier, standing as an integral part of a comprehensive strategy to make the pedal point an agent of irresistible drive and inexorable purpose. 151) in terms of abstract functional sequences-specifically, subversion and enclosure. Of course, the subversion of the thematic protagonist has already been described in detail-all that is left is to ascribe the act itself to an element playing an opposing role. This is easy enough since the pedal point, the subversive agent, proceeds directly from the final pitch, C, of motive X in the retransition-its incessant knelling thus linked linearly and psychologically to the antagonistic motive. This linkage, however, could be more or less direct. One need not, for example, conceive the pedal as a direct extension of the antagonist in order to implicate the antagonist in the act of subversion. A more plausible interpretation is that the pedal represents an agitated state of the persona precipitated by the preceding catastrophe, and that it is this agitated state that is directly responsible for subverting the expressive qual- ities of the thematic protagonist. On this view, then, there is a chain of causation: the antagonistic force brings about a state of agitation in the persona which in turn colors the memory of past events. The protagonist is also enclosed in a larger unit of structure (the dominant prolongation in, mm. 122-51) controlled by the antagonist. Its return in m. 136 is preceded by the ca- tastrophe in which its fondest dreams were crushed by the antagonist's thunderous hammering, and followed in mm. 145-48 by the reconstruction of the passage in which motive X had first delivered its warning. It is now possible to interpret this passage and its role in the plot of the movement. Only after the catastrophe of the retransition does the persona fully realize the magnitude of the threat that had been posed by the antagonist. Having suffered dearly for underestimating its adversary, it is in a state of extreme agitation that the persona attempts to re- construct the sonata's opening scene in order to ascertain what went wrong. Should the magnitude of the threat have been recognized when it was first delivered? What, if any- thing, had been done to precipitate the threat and what might</page><page sequence="18">30 Music Theory Spectrum have been done to neutralize it? These are the likely ques- tions occupying the persona. The subversion and enclosure of the protagonist in this passage indicate a downturn in the persona's fortunes and a commensurate advancement of the antagonist's position, a shift in power with consequences for the varied restatement following in m. 152. Here the torment of the persona is considerably more protracted than in the exposition-five outbursts at fortissimo rather than three dis- rupt the passage's progress-a development thoroughly con- sistent with its declining fortunes. There is little to say about motivation in the nearly literal recapitulation of the transition and second theme, for it is perfectly natural after its recent misfortunes that the persona should again wish to submerge itself in consoling dreams or hopeful visions. Nor is it remarkable that these ephemera should take forms nearly indistinguishable from their earlier manifestations-or indeed that they should be lost once more in the return to reality. These repetitions present no special difficulties for an interpretation of the work as an abstract fiction of mental life because, unlike dramatic scenes or sit- uations in literary narratives, dreams are wont to recur. This is why the nearly exact repetition of the second theme is unobjectionable, while an exact re-enactment of the dramatic scene embodied in the first theme would have been intol- erable. It is even possible that the very repetition of the second theme and closing has a special significance, marking the fleeting dreams of contentment and rude awakenings they contain as perennial, immutable facts of the persona's existence-the default conditions of its soul. Only in the coda does the persona once again make the effort of will required to overcome this psychic inertia and to advance the plot. Like the development, the coda begins on the principal theme and proceeds (without a transition this time) to tie main action, another attempt to project and sustain the persona's ideal state in the key of the submediant. Now given that just such an action led to disaster in the development, the choice to attempt it again must be under- stood, if not as a direct challenge to the controlling position of the antagonist, then at least as the most reckless tempting of fate. But perhaps the persona has learned from its mis- takes; at any rate, the pattern of phrases and foreshortening is altered in the coda, and the new solution initially seems more successful than its counterpart in the development. Here, as in the earlier episode, the theme is borne upward and foreshortened until a point corresponding to the original breaking point (m. 123) is reached in measure 218. In the coda, however, it seems that the crisis is weathered. When the texture fragments into wide-ranging arpeggiations, the fragments do not plummet catastrophically downward as in the development, but continue to soar over an ascending bass line until reaching the dominant in measure 233. What fuels the tension of the passage to this point is the expectation that motive X will enter as a violently disruptive force, just as it does in the initial statement of the opening theme and at the climax of the development. Indeed, the coda's construction in parallel with the development seems specifically calculated to raise and exploit this expectation, sustaining the movement's tension and forward drive through dramatic means long after its major tonal issues have been resolved. But because a point corresponding to the initial crisis point is allowed to pass uneventfully, this expectation is frustrated, and when motive X is quietly intoned in m. 235, the persona seems to be asking what the listener must be wondering as well: Has the threat been forgotten; will an- other catastrophe be averted? A sudden explosion of motive X (m. 239) is the answer, setting the final scene in motion, another desperate assertion of second theme, this time in the tonic minor (mm. 240ff.). It is quickly swallowed up by ma- terial derived from motive X (the motion between Db and C in mm. 251-56) and in the brief moment before it is con- sumed it bears little resemblance to its former self.

A graphic representation. It is possible to summarize the plot of the movement graphically, and though such an ex- ercise is not an indispensable step in a structuralist analysis, it has two potential benefits which I believe make it worth the effort. First, it contributes to clarity of interpretation by forcing one to conceive an entire movement as a unified hi- erarchy of dramatic events. Second, it can be useful in lo- cating dramatic strategies shared with other works. Fig. 1 (p. 21) demonstrates an approach to graphic notation that serves to represent the roles, functions, and larger dramatic sequences in the first movement of the Appassionata. Read- ing the figure roughly from left to right: At m. 10 the an- tagonist (A) enters, drawing the protagonist (P) into dialogue on a topic it dictates (subversion, S), and, through a threat it delivers, exerts a disruptive influence (disruption, D) which is indexed in the mangled transformation of P beginning at m. 17. This compromised transformation is indicated by lower case (p), while the forward pointing arrow indicates causation, in this case, that the misfortune befalling P is the result of actions (disruption and subversion) undertaken by A. In the transition (mm. 24ff.) the persona responds to the preceding events (a response to a preceding event or function is indicated by a backward arrow) by withdrawing (W), sub- merging itself in contemplation of an ideal condition to which it aspires (goal state, g). Lower case is used because the goal state is imagined but as yet unrealized. A nagging after- thought interrupts (I) the contemplative mood in m. 41, pav- ing the way for another scene of conflict in which elements of A and P are intermingled (Ap). A is the dominant element in this conflict and so the exposition closes with the antagonist in control (enclosure, E), the brackets extending back to the first entrance of A indicating its sphere of influence. Early in the development (m. 79), P launches a counteraction (C), allowing a respite in which the persona attempts to realize (R, realization) the goal state envisioned in the second theme. The attempt is unsuccessful (hence lower case g followed by a minus sign, m. 110); the goal state proves unsustainable, and A interrupts (m. 130), fulfilling the threat delivered in m. 10. During the recapitulation of the first theme A is in a controlling position with respect to P, enforced through func- tions of subversion, enclosure, and disruption (mm. 130-51). Its stronger position relative to that of P is indicated by bold type (A). Mm. 163-204 mirror passages from the exposition, and only with the persona's second counteraction to A's con- trol (m. 205) is the plot advanced. A second attempt to realize the persona's goal state initially meets with success (G, m. 211), but soon A enters (m. 235), disrupting the goal state, subsuming (enclosure) its last desperate echo (g--, m. 240ff.), and crushing the protagonist's hopes (p--, 257). SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The plot sketch above raises more questions about the meaning and expressive content of the first movement of the Appassionata than it attempts to answer, and what it does say about its significance in human terms is rather general. Ac- cording to this sketch, the movement is best understood as a record of mental impressions, the internal experience of a persona in pursuit of an ideal destined to be crushed by an inscrutable and intractable antagonistic force. It is about shat- tered dreams-not particular dreams, but dreams in the ab- stract. It is not the embodiment of any discrete ten minutes of the personals mental life, but an idealized fiction captur- ing the essence of the persona's experience with respect to external and psychological phenomena-experience gained over an indeterminate period of time, perhaps even a life- time. The musical agents are like allegorical personifications, not only of phenomena in the mind of the persona, but also, in a sense, of divisions of the psyche itself. The protagonist,</page><page sequence="20">32 Music Theory Spectrum as observed above, represents the seat of the persona's iden- tity; that which directs the focus of its consciousness. The second theme embodies a state to which the persona aspires constructed as an ideal image of the protagonist which the persona attempts unsuccessfully to project upon the world in the development and coda. The antagonist, which thwarts the realization of the persona's ideal state, might be unassimi- lated matter within the mind of the persona, perceived as foreign and inimical to the persona's aspirations, sense of self, or world view. It could represent mental impressions of a threatening extrapersonal force, deadly contradictions the persona has failed to resolve in its character or beliefs, nag- ging fears or doubts, feelings of guilt, or voices of societal condemnation lurking on the periphery of consciousness. From the array of alternatives offered above it should be clear that this structuralist method is not intended to generate specific claims about the meaning or expressive content of the work. Rather its purpose is to uncover the abstract dra- matic plan in which the movement's expressive coherence consists-for the movement is not expressively coherent be- cause it embodies a specific meaning or tells a particular story, but because its abstract dramatic plan possesses an inner logic capable of suggesting any number of stories of a particular type without telling any of them. But this sugges- tive ability, I maintain, is the essence not only of the work's expressive coherence, but of its formal coherence as well, so that in formulating the abstract structure of the movement's expressive-dramatic unfolding in structuralist terms, we in- evitably create an account of the semantic-expressive deter- minants of the movement's formal structure. By focusing on these two complementary aspects of musical works, a struc- turalist account of plot brings a kind of structural explanation to bear on issues of content and semantic-expressive inter- pretations to bear on problems of structure. This article con- cludes by suggesting the kind of work to which each mode of inquiry might be put. First, by conceiving a sequence of plot functions per- formed by agents cast in abstract dramatic roles as one de- terminant of formal relations in the Appassionata and other works, a framework emerges for answering the kind of ques- tions Leo Treitler has called "questions of motivation"- those addressing why particular musical events occur when and as they do.37 Why is the varied restatement of the prin- cipal theme mangled; why is the second theme derived from the first; why is motive X thundered out in the climactic retransition; why is the closing in the mediant minor; why does the first half of the coda parallel the structure of the development? These features, which are among the cardinal formal, expressive, and semantic facts of our analytical sub- ject, do not lie comfortably in the focus of traditional theory; a structuralist approach, on the other hand, comprehends them according to their function within a single, unified dra- matic plan. The utility of structuralist analysis in accounting for motivation in individual works is matched by its utility in locating common threads among works with seemingly little in common. Just as Vladimir Propp's structuralist analyses reveal recurrent patterns underlying the amazingly multi- form, picturesque, and colorful surfaces of Russian fairy tales, so structuralist analyses of musical plot reveal common patterns of dramatic construction in works remarkably varied in tone, expression, and formal detail. The opening move- ments of Beethoven's Appassionata, Eroica, and String Quar- tet, op. 59 no. 3, for example, while exemplifying three different genres and the three diametrically contrasting ex- pressive poles of the tragic, the heroic, and the comic re- spectively, are nonetheless organized by a common plot strategy: in each an unassimilated or antagonistic element enclosed in or disrupting the principal theme later runs amok, dominating the climactic points of both the development and coda, subverting or disrupting the thematic protagonist. In 37"To Worship that Celestial Sound."</page><page sequence="21">Structuralism and Musical Plot 33 the Eroica, the antagonistic element, the syncopated duple pattern of the third phrase (mm. 23-36), occupies exactly the same position within the principal theme as motive X in the Appassionata, though, unlike its counterpart, it is at first suc- cessfully enclosed by the protagonist. In the climactic passage of the development (mm. 248ff.), however, the antagonist rages for 31 measures at fortissimo, culminating in a sharply dissonant voicing of the Neapolitan 6/5 of E minor (m. 276- 79). The immediate consequence of this crisis is the so-called new theme of the development, which is in fact a subverted form of the protagonist. In the comic (or semi-serious) first act of the Quartet in C, op. 59 no. 3, the antagonistic element is the conspicuously trivial two-note motive opening the al- legro vivace (mm. 30-31); the crisis of the movement is the final section of the development (mm. 150-76) in which this motive runs amok, nattering incessantly in rhythmic canon and working itself to a crescendo; its consequence is the mys- tification of the first section of the principal theme in the recapitulation. Indeed the kind of dramatic motifs and func- tional sequences noted in this analysis of the Appassionata can be heard in other works with sufficient frequency to sug- gest that their manipulation was a central aspect of Beethov- en's art and one well worth the effort of systematic study. The complementary approach, conceiving content as the abstract structure of a work's expressive-dramatic unfolding, can guide writers engaging biographical, political, gender, and other content-centered issues in constructing internally consistent narrative interpretations of musical works and in evaluating the consistency and validity of such interpreta- tions. Two brief examples will indicate the range of issues which the structuralist analysis of plot might help to clarify. First, consider the political slant put on Shostakovich's Tenth Symphony by statements attributed to the composer in Tes- timony, a book of memoirs whose authenticity has been the subject of heated debate for nearly two decades. In it the composer is reputed to have said that the work is "about Stalin and the Stalin years. The second part, the scherzo, is a musical portrait of Stalin, roughly speaking."38 Since ma- terial related to that of the alleged Stalin portrait appears in each of the symphony's movements, one might explore the authenticity of these statements by analyzing the work in structuralist terms to see if the abstract roles and functions fulfilled by this material are consistent with statements at- tributed to the composer. First, does it play the central and presumably antagonistic role one would expect of material associated with the figure of Stalin in a work about Stalin and the Stalin years composed from Shostakovich's perspective? Is it, for example, cast in an opposing relationship to Shos- takovich's signature motive (D, El, C, B) which appears late in the work in the role of a principal protagonist, and does it appear at critical junctures in the symphony's dramatic plan? The answers to these, admittedly, carefully chosen questions might tend either to support or cast doubt on the authenticity of statements about the work's content in Tes- timony. As it happens, I believe they support it. In the de- velopment section of the finale the principal theme of the movement's allegro (first heard at reh. 153 + 2) is gradually subverted until it comes to resemble music of the Stalin portrait and at the climax of the movement, the denouement of the symphony's dramatic plan, a quotation of the Stalin theme (reh. 184 - 8) emerges from this subverted material, threatening an enclosure on the grand scale. In the retran- sition, however, it is violently interrupted by Shostakovich's signature motive sounding in orchestral unison at fff (reh. 184). These events are at least consistent with the content described in Testimony, and the irony of Shostakovich con- signing Stalin to oblivion by a mere signature is too delicious to dismiss lightly. 38Dmitri Shostakovich, Testimony: The Memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich, as related to and edited by Solomon Volkov, trans. Antonina W. Bouis (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1979), 141.</page><page sequence="22">34 Music Theory Spectrum Or suppose, to cite another example, one wished to in- terpret the first movement of the Appassionata according to Susan McClary's narrative paradigm for sonata-allegro move- ments of the common-practice period, that is, as a drama in which an antagonistic feminine Other embodied in the second theme threatens the identity of a masculine protagonist in- habiting the first.39 The structuralist analysis above would indicate consistent patterns of behavior, interaction, and re- lationship among the movement's agents that would have to be addressed in making such an interpretation internally con- sistent. Among these, one would have to explain the deri- vation of the second theme from the first as well as the tragic fate the two themes share. More important, one would have to justify carefully the ascription of an antagonistic role to the second theme given that, as in works by Beethoven, Schu- bert, and Tchaikovsky which McClary has specifically claimed as exemplars of this paradigm, it seems clearly to be upstaged by an antagonistic force within the principal theme or tonic area.40 While no approach to interpretation can resolve con- clusively the complex issues of content raised by these ex- 39McClary, "Sexual Politics in Classical Music," in Feminine Endings (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1991), 68-69; and "Narrative Agendas in 'Absolute Music'," in Musicology and Difference, ed. Ruth A. Solie (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), 326-44. 40The works in question are the first movements of Beethoven's Eroica, Schubert's "Unfinished," and Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 4. On the first two, see "Sexual Politics in Classical Music," 69; the first movement of the Tchaikovsky is the principal subject of the same essay. amples and others like them, the structuralist account of plot outlined above does provide a conceptual framework in which they can be focused and fruitfully debated. In interpreting works of the nineteenth and twentieth cen- turies, an era in which music's essence and aesthetic function were often defined in expressive terms and in relation to the internal life of its composers, critics exploring issues of con- tent and theorists pursuing models of musical teleology have increasingly recognized the need to integrate structural and semantic-expressive accounts of musical works in the act of analysis. A structuralist model of musical plot is one way in which this can be accomplished without indulging the ex- cesses of programmatic interpretation and without divorcing the notes themselves from the expressive and dramatic con- ceptions that may well have determined their existence and disposition in the act of composition. ABSTRACT An analytical method based on structuralist principles is developed for the exploration of an abstract and specifically musical form of dramatic organization, called musical plot, underlying works of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The fundamental semantic units of musical plots are binary relationships akin to literary foils and functional sequences, standard patterns of interaction among musical units, usually themes and motives, cast in abstract dramatic roles. The first movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata, op. 57, is analyzed by this method as a drama of mental life in which an antagonistic force within the first theme undermines the interests of the work's persona.</page></plain_text>
