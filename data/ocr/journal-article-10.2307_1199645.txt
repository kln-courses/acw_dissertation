<plain_text><page sequence="1">NATURALISM, HISTORICISM, AND CHRISTIAN ETHICS: TOWARD A CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE OF NATURAL LAW DOUGLAS STURM* THICAL reflection is a constitutive dimension of the Christian theo- logical enterprise. That is, if "the task of theology is that of the adequate conceptual statement in a given histori- cal situation of the existential under- standing of God, the world, and man, which is given in and with faith in the kerygma or proclamation of the Chris- tian church,"' and if, as seems evident, any existential understanding of God, the world, and man is of ethical import, then the theological task is incomplete without consideration of "the ground and goal, the motives and norms, the means and the consequences of right action."2 This consideration may well involve the theological ethicist in com- parative analyses in order to demon- strate by contrast or lack of contrast in what respect(s) his understanding of ethics is congruent with or divergent from other ethical alternatives, Chris- tian and/or non-Christian. As a result of such a comparative analysis, some theological ethicists have in recent decades been led to draw a severe line of differentiation between Christian ethics and the tradition of natural (moral) law theory in any and all of its forms. Thus Jacques Ellul sees a striking contradiction between [the concept of] natural law and what is revealed in scrip- tures regarding law and called divine law by us, for want of a better term. The doctrine of natural law as a Christian doctrine is thus ruled out at every point.3 And William Stringfellow, applauding vigorously, affirms "an original opposi- tion between natural law and Christian faith," for the notion of natural law rests upon the idea of the good as the aim of human life. But the Gospel does not rest at all on this concept, but upon the event of Jesus Christ and Christ is not some concept but the Person in whom Christians know the living God.4 It is the purpose of this essay to ex- amine this hypothesis of radical differ- entiation between the idea of natural (moral) law and Christian faith, first, by a presentation of its basis and, sec- ond, by the presentation of an alterna- tive position. In the latter part of the paper it will be argued that, contrary to the position expressed above, there is a form of natural law that is a neces- sary implicate of Christian faith. Here we shall take the term "law" (in the sense of moral law) to mean "any kind of rule or canon, whereby actions are framed"' or "a rule and measure of acts, whereby man is in- duced to act or restrained from act- ing."' By "natural" is meant that which is inborn or is of an inherent quality. Thus the natural is to be differentiated from the artificial or from that which is man-made. Consequently a natural (moral) law is a canon or rule of ac- tion which in some sense inheres in or is * The author was educated at Hiram College (A.B., 1950) and at the University of Chicago Divinity School (D.B., 1953, and Ph.D., 1959).

I. FOUNDATION OF THE OPPOSITION BETWEEN NATURAL LAW AND CHRISTIAN ETHICS The fundamental difficulty that leads Christian ethicists to reject the doc- trine of natural law is found in the judgment that natural law seems to suppose, that is, inherently to involve, a theory of reality that is radically alien to the Hebraic-Christian appre- hension of the nature of reality. Specif- ically, the doctrine of natural law im- plies a naturalistic view of reality whereas the Hebraic-Christian view is historical. To clarify the exact charac- ter of this conceived opposition we shall describe more precisely the meaning of the terms "naturalism" and "histori- cism" as they relate to the problem at hand. A. NATURALISM AND CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY It is a truism that the Western natu- ral-law tradition finds its roots in clas- sical antiquity.' To be sure, the doc- trine of natural law varies in content as differing "climates of opinion" prevail, altering the character of the mists that becloud men's eyes8 and/or as differing modes of economic production and dis- tribution "create" varying ideological superstructures;9 nonetheless the an- cients seem to have retained their posi- tion as having "stolen" (or, more accu- rately, formulated or at least prefig- ured) men's best ideas, and this is true of the development of natural-law doc- trine as well. The term "naturalism" is here used to designate that fundamental view of reality that is characteristic of classical antiquity. The "Greek mind," if one may be permitted such a generalization in an age of hardheaded empiricism,'0 viewed the world as governed in a unified and universal fashion by "definite and com- prehensible laws."" In art, in litera- ture, in philosophy, in education, the Greeks sought a "clear perception of the permanent rules which underlie all events and changes in nature and in human life."12 It must be made clear that the laws or rules of the universe were viewed in the dominant Greek tradition not mechanistically, but or- ganically. According to this organic per- spective, each aspect of the world was considered a part of a living whole. It is in this sense that "the idea of the cosmos is one of the outstanding con- tributions of Greek philosophy."'3 Yet at the same time, each object was itself seen as possessing the quality of whole- ness. On either the macrocosmic or the microcosmic level, to see the "whole" of the thing is to see its "idea"; and its "idea" is its nature. Thus to the Greek, it has been said, the natural apple was not the wild one from which our cultivated apple has been grown, but rather the golden apple of the Hesperides. The "nat- ural" object was that which expressed most completely the idea of the thing. It was the perfect object.14 The nature of a thing is its internal and essential principle of motion and rest, its definitive form constituting its resi- dent potentiality which is fulfilled only as actualized.15 On this basis one can speak intelligibly of the "innate tend- ency" in all "productions of nature" "in the direction of the best conditions of which they are capable.""' An ob- ject's innate tendency constitutes the law of its being. Thus the Greeks were members of the "school of immanence" with respect to their doctrine of law."</page><page sequence="3">42 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION From this perspective reality as a whole is basically and inherently order- ly, regular, uniform, systematic. "Any glorification of change was an idea for- eign to the Greeks. They . . . held the static and the immutable higher than that which fluctuates."s This under- standing of a permanent and inherent lawful order that is constitutive of things, underlying all movement and all change, is a constant theme "from Thales to Plotinus"; "it informs not only Greek metaphysics and cosmology, but also ethics; and it is the most pow- erful single factor in determining the Greek view of man."19 It should be observed at this point that the Greeks were above all con- cerned with man. Their anthropomorphic gods; their concentra- tion on the problem of depicting the human form in sculpture and even in painting; the logical sequence by which their philosophy moved from the problem of the cosmos to the problem of man, in which it culminated with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle; their poetry, whose inexhaustible theme ... is man, his destiny, and his gods; and finally their state which cannot be understood unless viewed as the force which shaped man and man's life- all these are separate rays from one great light. They are the expressions of an anthropo- centric attitude to life ... which pervades everything felt, made or thought by the Greeks. Other nations made gods, kings, spir- its; the Greeks alone made men.20 And the Greeks made men by the proc- ess of education, that is, by educing to- ward fulfilment or maturation the resi- dent potentialities of human nature. Education and, in fact, the whole so- cial-political order are conceived as in- struments of ethical realization, means of molding the human character in con- formity with the inherent laws of hu- manitas.21 It is intelligible within this view to say that "man's basic and prime duty is to become (in fact, actu- ally, fully, completely) what he is (in idea, potentially, germinally, essential- ly)" or that "the supreme principle of oughtness is simply this: Become your essential being."22 However whether the appeal is to the soul of man (Aristotle) or to the soul of the universe (Zeno), the final court of judgment in matters of moral behavior is the inherent nature of things, the permanent, eternal, immuta- ble "rightness" that characterizes the cosmos in its innermost essence. Im- morality is disease, abnormality a dis- tortion of the natural inclinations of the organism. This capsule depiction of the "Greek mind" involves, of course, a reckless neglect of the definitive differences in metaphysical and ethical theory and in the concomitant use of the term "natu- ral law" in the history of Greek life and thought.23 Nonetheless, it may suffice to demonstrate in a manner not wholly in- accurate the general understanding of reality within which the notion of nat- ural (moral) law (i.e., a canon or rule of action which inheres in or is consti- tutive of any situation within which action takes place) is intelligible. It is an understanding of reality that is nat- uralistic, humanistic, immanentalistic- and non-historical. On each of these points, the Christian ethicists referred to above demur. B. HISTORICISM AND CHRISTIAN FAITH The demurral results from a second truism, namely, that Christianity, as well as its Hebraic prologue, is a his- torical religion and involves a historical view of reality. The historicism that is characteristic of Christianity is of dual meaning. First, Christianity is founded upon a given historical event.</page><page sequence="4">NATURALISM, HISTORICISM, AND CHRISTIAN ETHICS 43 The God of the Bible is revealed not so much in the permanent structures of life through which history flows as in the "mighty acts," the peculiar events of history which point be- yond themselves to the ultimate ground and the mystery and meaning which give signifi- cance to our existence.24 What A. J. Heschel writes of Judaism in this respect25 is equally true, mutatis mutandis, of Christianity. Judaism, he argues is a "religion of time"; the God of Israel is not discovered in the facts of nature, but manifest in the events of history; since God is a living God, he is not merely at our disposal but speaks when he wills to speak. Thus "the root of Jewish faith is . .. not a comprehen- sion of abstract principles but an inner attachment to sacred events," a "com- mitment to revelation.""26 In the case of the Israelites, the event constitutive of their existence is the revelation of God on Mt. Sinai and the covenant there consummated between Yahweh and the people. In the case of the Christians, the definitive movement is the event of the revelation of God in Jesus Christ. Indeed this special revelation is con- ceived to be the historical event par excellence, for history, by definition, tends toward the unique, the non-repeti- tive, the einmalig, and revelation means the unique historical event which, by its very nature, must either take place once or not at all. And it is only revela- tion in this Christian sense which contains this element of absolute and never-recurring actuality.27 In this sense it has been said that of re- ligions, Christianity is the "only one that takes history seriously."'28 The holiness of the scriptures of the Hebraic-Christian tradition derives from the fact that these documents con- stitute the immediate testimony to this particular and unique sacred event. It is the task of Christian thought, relying on the witness of scripture "to state the significance and implications of these historical facts [the life, character, teaching, and death of Jesus Christ, and, above all, his resurrection] for our ultimate philosophy or attitude towards life.""29 This is to say that the Christian view of reality is based primarily, if not exclusively, upon the revelatory event wherein the Word of God is declared in Jesus Christ. Christian theology is thus kerygmatic; it is centered in the proc- lamation of what God has done; it ar- ticulates and interprets the "good news" of salvation made possible by di- vine grace. The destiny of man is un- derstood anew as a result of God's ac- tion on man's behalf. Further, it is in relation to what God has done in the event of revelation that the Christian community arrives at its understanding of "right action." Ethics, that is to say, is a subsidiary, yet an integral aspect, of theology. The didache of primitive Christianity (the instruction in the "ethical principles and obligations of the Christian life") is based upon and is the practical implication of the ke- rygma.30 This relationship between the proclaimed act of God and the practi- cal act of the Christian is, indeed, one of "conformation" (Bonhoeffer), for the Christian life is here understood as a re- enactment from below on the part of men of the shape of the revelatory drama of God's holy will in Jesus Christ. . . . This same shape of grace, in its re-capitulation within the life of the believer and the faithful community is the nuclear matrix which grounds and unfolds as the Christian life.31 The "divine imperative" (Brunner) is thus the implicate of the divine indica- tive. That is, the "shape of God's deed" in the particular and unique historical event of Christ constitutes the founda- tion of that rule or measure of human action which is typically Christian.</page><page sequence="5">44 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION At this point is to be understood the second (and related) meaning of his- toricism in Christianity. History, as in- dicated above, tends toward the unique and the non-repetitive. Each historical moment has its own (relatively) singu- lar character; it presents man with a novel configuration of possibilities, is composed of a complex of demands that has never confronted man before in ex- actly the same form. The commitment of the Christian is ever to heed the Word of God and ever to conform to the will of God. But the will of God is both known and unknown. It is known in Christ who is the incarnate concretion of God's ultimate and relentless will-to-restoration; and it remains unknown in the fact that the actual service of this will is presented to the believer not as a general program given in advance but as an everlast- ing and fluctuant obligation to the neighbor in the midst of history and life.32 The divine imperative is not, in the Christian view, derived from an appre- hension of the esential nature of man. Rather the demands of God "arise quite simply from the crisis of decision in which man stands before God."33 The utterances of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount are not general principles definitive of the category of humanitas, but of an "occasional character," mo- mentary concretizations of the revela- tion of God in Christ as that revelation confronts differing historical situa- tions.34 The Christian ethic is an ethic of obedience, duty, decision--but the particular content of the ethic is varia- ble, contingent upon the moment of ac- tion. In this sense, the Christian life is a life of "openness to the future";35 it is a life that is "open to forms and oc- casions of obedience that the emerging and unpredictable facts of man's in- volvement in social change constantly present to him for obedience.'3""6 It appears that Jacques Ellul may be an advocate of virtually the same thesis when he asserts that the "problem of the content of the divine law" is a mat- ter for an investigation that proceed(s) from God's revelation as it has been recorded in time, and received and un- derstood today by men who in turn live in time . . . we can grasp revelation only in one particular form and express it in one form for our own time.37 Thus Christianity is a historical re- ligion both in the sense that it originates in a certain complex event that consti- tutes the normative element in the Christian community in all of its sub- sequent phases and development and in the sense that it views God's imperative Word as being addressed anew to each novel moment of human history. Given this statement of the nature of Christianity, the contrast and clash with the Greek view are strikingly evi- dent. Whereas the Greek view of reality is naturalistic, anthropocentric, and hu- manistic, emphasizing the immanence of the laws of man's moral nature and the permanence of the human type, the Christian view of reality is historicistic, theocentric, emphasizing the historical- ly revealed will of God as the source of man's duty and the variability and uniqueness of the situation and de- mands of human action. The Greek ethic is an ethic of self-realization; the Christian ethic is an ethic of obedience. It is on the basis of this contrast that the argument of the incompatibility of the doctrine of natural law and Chris- tian faith rests. II. FOUNDATION OF THE CONGRUENCE BETWEEN NATURAL LAW AND CHRISTIAN FAITH However, the pattern of relationship between the notion of natural law and</page><page sequence="6">NATURALISM, HISTORICISM, AND CHRISTIAN ETHICS 45 the ethical import of Christian faith as- sumes a different cast when a more ade- quate account is taken of the complete structure of the Christian understand- ing of reality. There are three basic propositions that constitute this struc- ture, each proposition possessing (at least) a dual reference-to God and to man. First, God is creator; the anthro- pological correlate of this proposition is that man is created by God specifically in God's own image. Secondly, God is judge; the anthropological correlate of this statement is that man is a sinner, in whom therefore the image of God is deformed. Thirdly, God is redeemer; the anthropological correlate of this equation is that God initiates and ef- fects a transformation of man thereby accomplishing a restoral of the image of God.38 The same triadic structure is evident in the doctrine of the Christ. Christ is the Word (Logos) of God through whom all things were made, the origin and "location" of the norma- tive character or intentionality of crea- tion. Christ is therefore also the judge of creation, before whom all creatures are evaluated in relation to the divine intent. Christ is finally the one who re- constructs or reforms creation, fulfill- ing the divine purpose in creation. Within the structure of this doctrine, a number of characteristic judgments about the ethical meaning of the doc- trine of Christ are properly understood: In Christ, therefore, man is confronted with that Word, Wisdom, or Law which is the law of his creation, the same which was partially disclosed to Israel in the Torah, and is known in some measure to all mankind, through con- science and reason, as the Law of Nature.39 For the answer to the question "What is good?" the Christian looks at God's revelation in Jesus Christ. Christ is the restoration of the true image of man, because he is the in- carnation of the love which is the meaning of our existence.40 The idea that Christ is the "essential" man, the perfect norm of human character is ex- pressed scripturally in the Pauline phrase that Christ is the "second Adam." . . . The actual phrase is used sparingly. But the whole New Testament consistently regards Christ as the final norm of human character. The Johannine prologue regards Christ as the historical man- ifestation of the divine logos which is the pat- tern of the whole creation.41 Hence, the imitation of Christ [which is here presented as one of the typical features of the primitive Christian ethic], being the imitation of God himself so far as God can be a model to His creatures, becomes a mode of absolute ethics.42 It is also within the context of this structure that the historicity of Chris- tianity receives its appropriate inter- pretation. In relation to the first mean- ing of historicity, the event of the rev- elation of God in Jesus Christ does not men that "when Christ came the atti- tude of God to men altered, or His pur- pose for them took a new direction, or even His character changed for the bet- ter." Rather with the coming of Christ there was an effec- tive disclosure in action of what the attitude, and purpose, and character of God always was, always is, and always will be. [Thus] the God of our redemption is the same as the God of our creation. [And, therefore] the law of the new covenant, which is correlative with the act of God in Christ, is aboriginal. It is the law of our creation, and its field of application is as wide as the creation itself.43 It is an implication of this position that "the decision for or against Christ is made by people who do not even know his name."'' Thus while it is proper within the Christian understanding of the nature of things to emphasize the necessity of the revelation in Christ of the law (the rule or canon of action) that applies to the human creature, the "hidden Christ" that "operates in his- tory" must not be overlooked.45 To as-</page><page sequence="7">46 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION sert this doctrine of the "hidden Christ" that confronts man with the law of his being at every decisive moment of his existence is not to overlook the radi- cally sinful condition of man, for it is at least conceivable that what makes au- thentic existence everywhere factually possible is not that man is not completely fallen, but that, in spite of his fallenness, he is everlast- ingly the object of God's love, which is omni- presently efficacious as a redemptive possi- bility.46 Thus the historic event of Jesus as the Christ, which constitutes the origin and the normative foundation of the Chris- tian community, is an efficacious mani- festation of what always has been, is, and shall be the case, namely, that man "discovers," or is confronted at each moment with, the law of his being in an encounter with the living God, who is his creator, judge, and redeemer. In this sense, the historicity of Christian- ity in no way conflicts with the notion of natural (moral) law, at least in its formal character. Indeed, in this sense, the notion of natural law (i.e., a canon or rule of action that inheres in or is constitutive of any situation within which action takes place) is an essen- tial implication of Christian faith. This is not to say that the "law of man's being" is known or is operative inde- pendent of the revelation of God; rath- er it is to say that the law is "grounded in the claim of God which is his Word, that is to say, in the universal confron- tation of all men by the self-revealed God."47 However, even if it is the case that the originating historical event of the Christian community is nothing more (though nothing less!) than an effica- cious and decisive manifestation of the omnipresently operative grace of God, calling men toward the actualization of the divine purpose of creation, there is the second (and related) sense in which historicism is integral to Christian faith; and it is in relation to this sense that the notion of natural (moral) law is also often eschewed by Christian ethicists. Each historical moment is conceived to possess its own singular character; there is an ever changing, mutable, transformative character to the course of historical events; conse- quently (it is said) each instant of moral decision confronts each man with a novel complex of possibilities and de- mands. The content of the faithful man's ethical obligation is held thus to be ever fluctuant, taking account of the peculiarity of the circumstances of ac- tion. On the other hand, natural (moral) law seems to present itself as possessing the characteristics of per- manence, immutability, universality, constancy,48 for it presumes to present a rule or canon of action that is the same for all men at all times and in all places. There is a tendency in a moral law that is founded in the common na- ture of the human species or in the na- ture of the cosmos to "leave out of ac- count the variability of human desires and sensitivities in different times and climes,"49 or to consider such variabil- ity unnatural, or of a lesser order of reality than the static and unvarying. Where Christianity "takes history se- riously," the tendency is for natural- law theorists to assume a non-historical or transhistorical stance. Stated in this way it would appear that an ethic must either conceive moral principles as per- manent, immutable, static or view men's obligations as changing, mutable, variable. However, it can be argued that there is a third position, according to which the ethic in some sense syn-</page><page sequence="8">NATURALISM, HISTORICISM, AND CHRISTIAN ETHICS 47 thesizes both these alternatives. Indeed, it can be argued that the natural (mor- al) law that constitutes the primary (if not the exclusive) ethical obligation of Christian faith, while immutable, per- manent, and universal, yet is of such a character that it incorporates within it- self an imperative insistence upon tak- ing full and proper account of the mu- table, the transient, and the particular. To be specific, according to Christian understanding, the natural (moral) law is the law of love."5 That is, the funda- mental rule or canon of action is the twofold commandment: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."5" The appropriate form of human action is thus a repetition of the form of divine action. As God loves, so is man meant to love. Love in this in- stance means the creation of a bond of sympathy, concern, care for the other; it means acting on his behalf and for his benefit; it means concretely meet- ing his needs; it means the intention or active determination of will that is di- rected toward the fulfilment of the re- quirements of his well-being. Love so conceived is both universal in scope and individual in attention. "God is held to love all, not just a few; always, not just at times; in all their being, not with neglect of this or that aspect."52 Given this love which is expressed su- premely by God and is meant to be re- sponsively actualized by man, the re- sultant form of relationship is "a syn- thesis of . . . change and permanence, or the one and the many, or order and creative freedom.'" That is, love, by its very nature, although ever the same, takes full account of the historicity of existence and is the principle of action that itself involves or spontaneously necessitates attention to the particular- ity of circumstance within which it at- tains actualization. Thus love, as the supreme rule or canon of human action in human relations, means sympathetic concern and active care for the neigh- bor-for each neighbor and every neighbor in each particular and pecu- liar moment of existence and at every particular and peculiar moment of ex- istence. It might not be inappropriate to ob- serve that this understanding of love as the rule or canon of action aims ulti- mately toward the actualization of a re- lationship of mutual care and concern or of mutual love.54 This is so because if to love is God's nature and if there- fore for man to love is to actualize the image of God in which man is created and so to fulfil the divine intent for mankind, and if to love one's neighbor is actively to intend the fulfilment of his being, then to love another is to desire that the other in turn love as he has been loved. This is to say that the in- tention of the creative, judging, and re- deeming impress of God upon the events of human existence is the for- mulation of "a community knit togeth- er by self-giving love"55 which in its fi- nal form gathers up all the nations into one. In such a community "what flows from each enriches the life of all and each participant in the whole life finds his own good realized through the giv- ing of self to the life of the whole.""5 Thus the love commandment intends or means a "condition of complete har- mony between the soul and God, its neighbor and itself.""'57 This natural (moral) law of love,</page><page sequence="9">48 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION which directs man toward the realiza- tion of a universal community of love, is understood within Christian faith to be a universal, permanent, immutable law, and in general structure it is ever the same. But its precise actualization, given its very nature, is variable, as the conditions of human existence vary. In this sense, the natural (moral) law of love is more a "quality and direction of action"58 than a principle that provides within itself a precise and detailed in- dication of all that is required of man. Thus the actualization of love will as- sume various typical forms in reference to the his- torical climates or constellations through which the development of mankind passes.... And it is according to these historical climates, as recognized by a sound philosophy of history, which is here indispensable, that we have to conceive the concrete historical ideals, or pros- pective images of what is to be hoped for in our age: ideals which are neither absolute nor bound to an unrealizable past, but which are relative-relative to a given time-and can be proclaimed and pursued as realizable.59 Consequently in the Christian ethic, the fundamental principle of action is permanent, immutable, static, yet is of such a character that according to it men's obligations are, in the respect in- dicated, changing, mutable, variable. In other words, Christianity does indeed "take history seriously," but does so by means of its apprehension of that per- manent character or pattern of reality by virtue of which there is a single uni- verse or world within which change (thus history) is possible and natural. It is possible, therefore, by taking adequate account of the complete struc- ture and meaning of the Christian un- derstanding of reality, to conclude that a line of absolute differentiation ought not be drawn between Christian ethics and the notion of natural (moral) law. Indeed, according to Christian faith, there is a rule or canon of action that is constitutive of every situation within which men act, for There lives the dearest freshness deep down things; Because the Holy Ghost over the bent World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings. [Gerard Manley Hopkins, "God's Gran- deur"] And this natural law, although possess- ing the quality of constancy, immuta- bility, and permanence does not ignore and does not depreciate historical par- ticularity and historical process; rather it incorporates within itself an impera- tive declaration that the uniqueness of the situation of decision and action be heeded and be (in part) determinative of the precise form of the actualization of itself. It is an implication of the position here presented that while the Greek classical "concept of nature as a closed system, determined by its own exclu- sive laws"60 is unacceptable, Christian faith does not imply the opposite- sheer historicism-in its rejection. Rather it involves and implies a prin- ciple of reality that takes full and in- tegral account of both order and activ- ity, structure and process, law and free- dom. Consequently modern Christian ethical reflection might well benefit from a consideration of classical moral and political philosophy (as in fact it has done in the past!), not repudiating the Greek tradition out of hand, but learning from the tradition while bring- ing to bear upon it the determinative criterion of its own understanding of</page><page sequence="10">NATURALISM, HISTORICISM, AND CHRISTIAN ETHICS 49 the nature of reality and the consequent natural law of human action-the law of love-that is a constitutive part of and is derived from that understanding.

The statement con- tinues: "What is decisive is only whether they act for or against the law of love for which Christ stands. Acting according to it means being received in the unity of fulfilment. Acting against it means being excluded from fulfilment and being cast into the despair of non-being. This is biblical ethics." 45. Reinhold Niebuhr, Nature and Destiny of Man, II, 109, n. 6. 46. Schubert Ogden, Christ without Myth (New York: Harper &amp; Bros., 1961), p. 121. On pp. 141-44, Ogden presents three lines of evidence to document this position exegetically: (1) with reference to Rom. 1:20-21, Ogden states that "the New Testa- ment never doubts for an instant that before God each individual person is entirely and radically re- sponsible for his final destiny." (2) With reference to I Cor. 15: 24-28, he argues that "the only basis of man's salvation the New Testament knows any- thing about is the everlasting love of God that is primordially active in the mighty works of creation, preservation, and redemption." (3) With reference to Matt. 25: 31-46, Ogden affirms that "the only final condition for sharing in authentic life that the New Testament lays down is a condition that can be formulated in complete abstraction from the event Jesus of Nazareth and all that it spe- cifically imports." 47. Schrey et al., op. cit., p. 135. 48. See, e.g., James Luther Adams, "The Law of Nature: Some General Considerations," Journal of Religion, XXV (1945), 88: "The concept of the Law of Nature involves essentially a consideration of the perennial problem of the One and the Many. This is the problem of discovering something that abides in the midst of change and serves to measure it." 49. Ibid., p. 96. 50. It has been argued that the central or consti- tutive category of the Christian ethic is not love, but faith. See, e.g., the argument presented by Sittler in his The Structure of Christian Ethics, pp. 42-64. There is a sense in which this is correct. If one takes faith to mean "ultimate concern" (Tillich) or "the attitude and action of confidence in, or fidelity to, certain realities as the sources of value and the objects of loyalty" (H. R. Nie- buhr) and if, as follows, the specific character of one's faith is the determinant of the specific mode or pattern of one's activity, and if one conceives love to intend or itself to mean a certain specific pattern of activity, then a given form of faith precedes and is the foundation of love. Yet it must be observed that within such a form of faith, love would constitute a sine qua non of faith; and in fact, it would constitute the central category so far as an explication of the ethical implications and significance of that form of faith is concerned. Further, it is difficult, given these indications of the meaning of faith to know precisely what the specific difference is, if any, between faith in God and the love of God! It has also been argued that love (agape) constitutes the ultimate Christian ideal, a higher righteousness which is clearly dis- tinguishable from justice. The latter alone is analogous to the natural-law concept of the Greeks and others. See, e.g., Walter Marshall Horton, "Natural Law and International Order," Christen- dom, IV (1944), 2, 20. On the other hand, G. Ernest Wright in The Biblical Doctrine of Man in Society (London: SCM Press, 1954), pp. 167-68, indicates that "the all-embracing guide to relative choices and ethical judgments is, of course, the law of neighborly love" and whereas "much has been written in modern times to indicate the difference between, and the relation of, love and justice" the fact of the matter is that "the biblical words for 'righteousness,' 'justice,' or 'judgment' or even 'vengeance' . .. reflect the biblical knowledge of God's nature as the dominant Actor in history. Hence they involve both 'love' and 'justice.' These two conceptions simply cannot be separated because they are united in God." And, of course, Paul Tillich in his Love, Power, and Justice (New York: Oxford University Press, 1954) argues that both love and justice possess ontological status and are integrally related such that one cannot speak of love as a higher morality than justice. 51.

In this passage from Man and the State, Maritain is discussing the pattern of relation between church and state that is appropriate, given the modern historical climate as distinguished from the medieval historical climate; in True Humanism, trans. M. R. Adamson (London: Geoffrey Bles, 1954) the same conception is discussed with refer- ence to the basic structure of modern Western civilization as a whole. While the quotation above is taken out of its original context, there is no essential distortion of Maritain's conception.
