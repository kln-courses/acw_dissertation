GALTER UNIVERSITY OF GRAZ Uruk: Hellenistic Seal Impressions in the Yale Babylonian Collection, I: Cuneiform Tablets. By RONALD WALLENFELS. Deutsches Archaologisches Institut, Abt. Baghdad: Aus- grabungen in Uruk-Warka, Endberichte, vol. 19. Mainz am Rhein: VERLAG PHILIPP VON ZABERN, 1994. Pp. xii + 206 + 62 plates. DM 150. This volume is an expanded, fully illustrated reworking of Wallenfels' 1990 Columbia University dissertation, "Sealed Cuneiform Texts from Hellenistic Uruk: An Iconographic and Prosopographic Analysis of the Private Business Documents." Wallenfels studies the connections between seal motifs and the personal names in the seal captions, hoping to understand how seals were selected and used in Seleucid Uruk and whether Hellenism had an effect on these practices. The volume begins with an introduction that appropriately focuses on such issues as the paucity of published sealed tab- lets and the fact that Hellenistic Babylonian material has his- torically been treated by scholars of Greek rather than Near Eastern history. The core of the volume is the catalogue of 1100 different seal impressions found on 154 cuneiform tablets and fragments from Hellenistic Uruk housed in the Yale Baby- lonian Collection. The catalogue contains 423 supplemental entries detailing previously published seal impressions from Hellenistic Uruk tablets in other collections that do not dupli- cate the Yale impressions. The 154 sealed tablets treated range in date between 329 and 132 B.C.E. (8 and 180 S.E.) and repre- sent twenty-two percent of the 700 known Hellenistic Uruk tablets. The seal impressions are uninscribed and belonged to pri- vate individuals (rather than to officials), the principal parties and witnesses of private business documents. Seleucid texts were typically witnessed by eight to twelve individuals, a num- ber much higher than earlier Neo-Babylonian and Achaemenid contracts, and virtually all of the witnesses sealed the tablet. The contractor(s) ceding rights or property or accepting an obligation sealed the right edge; witnesses placed their seals on the remaining edges. Most of the impressions were made by metal finger rings with elliptical bezels. The other seal forms attested are gems (79 examples; 5% of the total), stamps (10 examples) and cylinders (4 examples). The catalogue is divided into eight major iconographic categories, as defined by their dominant motifs: heads and busts (27 examples), full figured humans (96 examples), full figured an- thropomorphic deities (54 examples), semi-human demons (32 examples), human-headed and man-faced demons (243 exam- ples), monstrous animals (261 examples), animals (309 exam- ples), and miscellany (20 examples). The remaining impressions include one official stamp-seal impression, one cylinder-seal im- pression and 56 examples that are listed as "non-descript" (i.e., essentially complete, but not readily recognizable). Whether these images were similarly perceived as "non-descript" by their ancient owners or whether the exact identification of the motif was even a priority to the seal owners is not discussed. Each category is further subdivided according to details of iconog- raphy and secondary elements. Thus, lions are one of fifteen animals discussed, and 125 lions are subdivided into recum- bent, seated, six variants of walking poses, four types of leaping poses, fragmentary or ambiguous poses, and attacking prey. Each iconographic group is preceded by an introduction that explores briefly the origins of the motif. Wallenfels is the first to attempt a detailed typology of the diverse Seleucid seal rep- ertoire. His separation of the material into 147 subdivisions highlights minor variations in iconography rather than similari- ties in composition. Each catalogue entry includes: a line drawing at twice actual size, the shape and dimensions of the impression, a brief de- scription, the personal name, patronym, ancestor name and, occasionally, occupational designation of the seal user, the ex- act date of the transaction, the sealer's role in the transaction, the type of transaction, the tablet siglum, the location of the impression on the tablet, and the sources of any previous publi- cation of the impressions. The plates at the end of the volume furnish black and white photographs of the 1100 Yale seal im- pressions (at twice actual size). The 423 supplemental entries are not illustrated. The catalogue is followed by a chapter of observations and conclusions and three appendices: "Zodiacal Signs among the Uruk Tablet Seal Impressions" (a slightly modified version of Wallenfels 1993), "Index of Personal Names Connected with Seal Impressions from Hellenistic Uruk," and "Sealed Archival Tablets from Hellenistic Uruk in the Yale Babylonian Collec- tion." Concordances, an extensive bibliography, and sixty-two plates, each with sixteen to twenty sharp, high-quality black and white photographs, complete the volume. In his conclusions, Wallenfels notes that people replaced their seals at will (for those few people who acquired new seals, the average period of use per seal was about eight years) and that seal choice seems to have been a matter of personal taste-observations that are generally assumed, but it is good to see them supported by hard data. To judge from the theophoric 91</page><page sequence="2">Journal of the American Oriental Society 118.1 (1998) elements in personal names, most of the population was from Uruk, and it will be very interesting to compare the Uruk seal repertoire with that from Seleucia-on-the-Tigris when the 30,000 sealings from the Municipal Archive Building are published (Invernizzi 1994). Wallenfels cites the use of metal rings, the seal motifs, and the presence of Greek personal names as clear evidence of the impact of Hellenism in Seleucid Mesopotamia. I am struck, however, by the extremely limited impact of Hellenism and the strength of the Babylonian tradition. First, since the wide- spread use of metal finger rings-many of which have distinc- tive Western motifs-is attested already on the late fifth century B.C.E. tablets of the Murashu Archive from Nippur, the use of rings and the popularity of many non-Babylonian images cannot be attributed to Greek influence during the Hel- lenistic period. Moreover, the extensive use of traditional sec- ondary motifs such as crescent moons (on 250 impressions) and stars (on 151 impressions), in combination with the very small number of ethnic Greeks living in Uruk (only 26 men out of about 3000 named in the Uruk documents had both Greek personal names and patronymics) and the almost complete absence of Greek loanwords, is perhaps the best evidence for the limited foreign impact and the persistence of ancient Baby- lonian traditions. By contrast, one element of Babylonian in- fluence on Hellenistic Greek culture is very visible in the seal motifs: the zodiac. Wallenfels' important contribution to the understanding of the development of the representations of the twelve zodiacal signs and the identification of seals featuring astrologically meaningful combinations of zodiacal signs ap- pears in appendix I. The volume is conveniently organized and readers can mine its rich contents according to their own interest. For example, the material can be organized to examine how and why seal styles changed and at what pace, changes that may be symp- tomatic of wider cultural developments. To examine how the seal motifs' selection changed over time, I tabulated the seals used by three separate generations, selecting the seals used in three chronological groups, each separated by thirty-five years, about one generation: Early Group (295-275 B.C.E.; 14 tablets; 137 impressions), Middle Group (240-220 B.C.E.; 19 tablets; 167 impressions), Late Group (185-162 B.C.E.; 17 tablets; 126 impressions). I found that the seals in Wallenfels' category "heads and busts" are characteristic of the mid-second cen- tury B.C.E. and not earlier: of the twenty-seven seals in this category, not one was used in the Early Group, only one was used in the Middle Group, but eight (30% of the total) belong to the Late Group. Also, representations of full-figured mortals decrease in popularity (from twenty examples in the Early Group to four examples in the Late Group), while depictions of anthropomorphic deities increase (from one example in the Early Group to seven examples in the Late Group), a trend that may reflect real changes in religious attitudes or may be a coincidental shift due to our subjective and possibly incorrect assumptions as to the features that distinguish mortals from gods. Interestingly, the popularity of seals with human-headed demons, monstrous animals, and animals was constant through- out the one-hundred-fifty-year period spanned by the three groups. Indeed, the preference for the three most popular exam- ples of each of those categories, the sphinx, the winged bull, and the lion (which combined make up one-third of the cata- logue) is uniform throughout the period represented by the Uruk tablets. Moreover, some specific motifs and seal types emerge as chronological markers or markers of individual hands. Thus the six seals showing a hero combating an animal (catalogue nos. 41-46) all date very early in the period, from 303-292 B.C.E. The closeness in style, iconography, and date between the thirteen seals with confronted sphinxes flanking a column (cat- alogue nos. 271-83; used only between 184-153 B.C.E.) may be a chronological marker or even the work of a single work- shop. The three examples of serpo-dragons (mughussu) (cata- logue nos. 455-57), which all lie on identical altars and were used within two months of each other in 276 B.C.E., are possi- bly the products of one seal-cutter. In addition, the seal types may have some chronological implications: the use of gems is not well attested at Uruk until after about 237 B.C.E. (75 S.E.; fewer than ten of the sixty-nine gems were used before that date). Wallenfels has produced an excellent volume that is essential for anyone working with Mesopotamian glyptic or the material culture of Mesopotamia in the later periods. The camera-ready copy was skillfully produced by Wallenfels with very few addi- tions and corrections (a list can be obtained from Wallenfels). This beautifully and meticulously produced folio volume is a model for the publication seal impressions in their documentary context. REFERENCES Invernizzi, A.
