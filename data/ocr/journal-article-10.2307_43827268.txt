Effective presentation skills and a variety of instructional techniques are just as important particularly at the middle/junior high level. One teaching tool which has tremendous potential for promoting success and building positive teacher- student relationships is storytelling. Storytelling can be fun as well as an innovative means to present difficult concepts. With some practice and planning, anyone can be a storyteller. Through instructional storytelling, a teacher can introduce variety, enthusiasm, a sense of humor, sensitivity, and resourcefulness in planning daily lessons. He or she may use gestures, simple visual aids such as pictures and sketches, as well as other available props. "Let me tell you a story about" is a line that invariably captures the attention of all students. Over the years as a high school biology teacher, I have developed a repertoire of stories and anecdotes which capture interest and attention, can be used to reinforce and review a concept, and can transform ordinary facts into memorable ones. Many of my tales are based on facts gathered from the media. Others are derived from stories created about concepts to which I add my own brand of humor. I have a penchant for exaggeration, puns, statements with "shock" value, and anthropomorphism. The latter form of expression is usually forbidden in science-related endeavors; however, if used thoughtfully with early adolescents, it can promote science learning as the following examples illustrate. A Digestive Drama The Story of Robby Rectum focuses on an important part of the human anatomy. I play the part of Robby and express his lament over having "the most unglamorous job in the entire digestive system." He describes how he longs to receive food that still retains eye-appeal, such as a juicy hamburger, but he disappointedly complains, "I keep wondering, where's the beef?" Robby mischievously admits that he occasionally causes some embarrassment by making peculiar noises or by adjusting, one way or the other, the speed at which his cargo is eliminated from the body. He assures listeners that most of the time he does try to behave. A Tale of Two Species Another story focuses on the concepts of natural selection and speciation which are often difficult for students to comprehend. In nature, two requirements must be met in order for new, separate species to evolve from an existing species. These are geographic isolation followed by development of genetic barriers that prevent interbreeding. The story begins with the depiction of a species of white rats which live on White Island, characterized by white sandy shores and white rocks. Occasionally, mutant brown or spotted rats are born. Since the dark-colored rats are conspicuous against the light surroundings, most are eliminated by a hawk predator. Many generations pass, and White Island becomes overcrowded with rats. A small group of adventuresome rats, some brown and some white, decide to leave White Island 18 SCIENCE SCOPE</page><page sequence="2">to establish a new colony. They get aboard a log that has washed up along the shore and are carried hundreds of miles across the ocean to a remote island called Brown Island. Brown Island is characterized by dark shores, dark rocks, and dark trees. Here, the dark rats thrive while the white rats are easily spotted and eliminated by a hawk predator. Decades pass. Natural selection on White Island favors white rats with red eyes, long tails, and pointed ears. Natural selection on Brown Island favors brown rats with black eyes, no tails, and small rounded ears. Some of the brown rat descendents are curious about visiting their long unseen relatives on White Island. One day, several adventurous brown males hop aboard a log and begin the voyage toward White Island. During the trip, they enthusiastically discuss the idea of meeting prospective mates. Finally, they arrive on White Island and are met by a greeting committee of white female rats. Both groups of rats are initially awestruck by the differences in their physical appearance. Then one brazen brown male boldly asks one of the females to become his mate. Taken aback by the suddenness of his proposal, she hesitates and then asks, "When is your breeding season?" "Right now," exclaims the brown male. "Oh-oh. That's going to be a problem. We don't breed for another six months. What is your diploid chromosome number?" "Forty-four," responds the brown male. "Oh, no! Mine is forty-two!" Meanwhile, the other brown males were experiencing similar disappointments. Dejectedly, the males returned to Brown Island where they did not face such reproductive obstacles. * ♦ * * The preceding stories provide many opportunities for teacher creativity and improvisation. Although teachers generally are not thought of as entertainers, they can effectively take advantage of the performing arts such as enthusiasm, variety, sensitivity, humor, and razzmatazz. Exaggerating concepts by using them in stories emphasizes them, makes them understandable, and most importantly, makes them memorable to students. Storytelling allows listeners to integrate new ideas into their own experiences. With the current barrage of worksheets, dittos, and paperwork, the use of storytelling offers a refreshing alternative. KARA H. MAY James B.
