<plain_text><page sequence="1">SURVEY OF RECENT BIBLICAL LITERATURE I. CRITICISM A SURVEY of Old Testament studies in recent years cannot but im- press one with the fact that an interpretation of Old Testament history and religion on traditional lines, even while admitting the principles of the Documentary Theory, no longer holds the field among the leading biblical scholars-leaving aside the Catholic seats of learning and others that deny the premnises and fundamental principles of modern criticism altogether. As it is proverbially easier to float with the current than against it, no blame can be attached to the modern "Minor Prophets" for following the lines of least resistance and joining the procession. However, it is an undeniable fact that it is a rare occurrence to find one of the latter investigating both sides of the problem and discussing the attempts at justification of the traditional views. Does not such a pro- cedure in biblical studies indicate that the general agreement is not based upon independent investigations, but rather upon a critical tradition of various theological institutions which superseded the ancient Hebrew tradition? As a rule, everywhere we meet with the same arguments, the same ideas, and the same conclusions. According to a saying of the Rabbis, King Jehoshaphat suspected the genuine character of a predic- tion of four hundred prophets of the Lord on account of an ancestral tradition that no two prophets use identical expressions. We wonder whether we may not apply the same criterion to our modern "Prophets!" "Is there not here besides a prophet of the Lord, that we might inquire also of him?" we may ask in the words of that pious Judean king. The critical school numbers among its proponents, especially in the native land of biblical criticism, not a few scholars of high repute, in the past as in the present, whose critical views are fairly moderate, insisting upon genuine Mosaic traditions in the various biblical Doc- uments of which they hold the Pentateuch to be composed. But as far as we can see, the views and critical theories of these moderate critics are completely ignored by the present generation of biblical scholars, especially by those of America and England, into which biblical criticism "made in Germany" was imported and where it was fondly received and 407</page><page sequence="2">408 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW naturalized, and has become more powerful than in the land of its na- tivity. The modern textbooks that present an outline of the develop- ment of biblical criticismn pass in silence over the names of scholars who, notwithstanding their critical positions, do not attack the historical character of the Pentateuch. We look in vain for their names in the bibliographies and indices of modern studies, dealing with Old Testa- ment problems. This method is the best means of silencing all opposi- tion to the radical theories. Outside of the love of truth and the satis- faction of their own conscience, there is no incentive for conservative scholars to devote their energies and ingenuity to a refutation of those radical theories, seeing that their labors are ignored by their opponents. If such a treatment is accorded to scholars who insist upon the Doc- umentary Theory in its essential features, but deviate from that of Kuenen-Wellhausen, Stade, Budde, Cornill, etc., what treatment miiay conservative scholars expect, who go still further in doubting or denying the Documentary Theory altogether and claim Mosaic authorship for the Pentateuch? This method prevailing in the recent biblical litera- ture is exceedingly mischievous. The student is thereby misled into the belief that there is no middle way between the two extreme views, so that one is forced to adopt either the radical or traditional views-and it is not surprising that a student should feel some reluctance in ac- cepting the orthodox interpretation. But this is far from being the truth. Suppose that we grant that the Pentateuch contains numerous anachronisms which cannot be ascribed to Moses. The argument from these discrepancies is directed only against the orthodox view that the Pentateuch in its present fornm, without any changes, was the work of Moses-a view that on the whole rests upon tradition, and can scarcely be supported by documentary evidence. But this argument would fall flat, if one assumes that the original work of Israel's Lawgiver was re-edited and revised again and again during post-Mosaic periods. While post-exilic Judaism may or may not have believed in verbal inspiration, there is scarcely room for doubt that such a belief did not exist in pre- exilic times. They cared only for the contents of the Mosaic Laws, and not for the words and the style in which they had been formulated. Hence there was no reason why a priestly teacher should not have re- written a part or the whole of it in his own style and terminology, if such a revision would be more adapted to his own age, or why he should not have made excerpts from it as a manual for instruction. In the course of time a whole literature of that kind may have accumulated. This literature may have been worked over again and again by generations</page><page sequence="3">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 409 of scholars, so that slight variations or seeming contradictions would be almost inevitable. Furthermore, in dealing with this problem we must guard ourselves against carrying modern conceptions into an early period. While modern scholars write commentaries, the pre-exilic writers achieved the same purpose by expanding some biblical passages or commandments accord- ing to their best knowledge and traditions, or by adding some historical glosses. Differences in interpretation during many centuries are of course to be expected. Thus all their editions of the Mosaic Laws may have widely differed in style, terminology, and interpretation, and yet all these writers recorded or sincerely believed that they recorded gen- uine Mosaic traditions based upon the original Mosaic Books. There is still another point that must be taken into consideration. The founder of the North-Israel Kingdom, Jeroboam, must have been exceedingly anxious that his religious institutions should not come into collision with the Mosaic Laws, and according to the testimony of the First Book of Kings (13, 33), the Levitical tribe lost its priestly preroga- tives in his dominion. Is it not reasonable to presume that the Mosaic Code was revised under his reign in a way that there should not be the least reference to the origin of the priesthood and their function, and that this revised Code became the standard Mosaic Code of North-Israel? It goes without saying that in such a Code we would not expect any reference to the prohibition of image-worship. If we may credit this king with common sense, he must have been aware that a Mosaic Code condemning his religious institutions would be exceedingly dangerous to the existence of his kingdom. In taking into consideration all these presumptions which are rea- sonable, it is obvious that a believer in the Documentary Theory must not necessarily deny the genuine character of the Mosaic traditions con- tained in the Documents of the Pentateuch. Now it stands to reason that the original Mosaic Code, which was doubtless written on papyri, was deposited in the chief sanctuary at Shiloh, and we cannot assume that it survived when this sanctuary was destroyed. Thus the Mosaic traditions preserved were those found in the copies made by the Levitical priests for the purpose of instruction, and there was no possibility of comparing these copies with the original. As a matter of fact, the real problem in biblical criticism is not whether the Pentateuch was written wholly or partly by Moses. He might after all have been termed its author, even if its actual writing belonged to a later period. But the fundamental question is, whether</page><page sequence="4">410 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the writers of the various accounts actually believed that they recorded Mosaic traditions, and notwithstanding seeming contradictions, we might apply to them what the Rabbis said of thc Schools of Hillel and Slhammnai: "Both are the words of the Living God. " Or were they pseud- epigraphical authors who consciously used the name of Moses for the purpose of imposing their own religious views upon the people, and there- fore invented a background for Israel's history that was partly based upon dim legendary traditions, and for the most part never existed but in their own imaginations? The latter opinion is actually more or less that of the modern critics. If we accept this opinion, the Pentateuch would be the work of men morally depraved, without reverence for God, ascribing to the Almighty words He never said, actions He never did; it would be the work of men to whom the truth would be of no concern, if a falsehood served their purpose. It is needles to say that a work of men of this type ought not to deserve any credence, and the question would be whether it contained any truth at all. This would be the logical outcome of the views as conceived by the modern critical school. This is especially true of the Laws of the so-called Priestly Code, which are generally regarded by all who follow the lead of Wellhausen, Cornill, etc., as inventions pure and simple of the School of Ezekiel. Such a view that would reduce the Pentateuch or some of its components to the level of Pseudepigraphical works of the Alexandrian period ought not to pass unchallenged. Yet this view is actually presumed as a truism in most of the books under present survey. Therefore a discussion of the Pen- tateuch problem is surely not superfluous. However, a thorough treat- ment of this subject would exceed the compass of an essay, and it shall be limited to the discussion of a, single question. But in raising this question, we must free our minds from all ancient and modern concep- tions and beliefs concerning the composition of the Pentateuch, and investigate the problem on purely historical lines. If we admit the historical character of Moses as Israel's Lawgiver and Founder of its religion-and this is readily admitted by almost all critics-, the question is in order: What kind of Code may he have for- mulated for Israel? Now if we may judge by historical analogies, such as the Code of Hammurabi, the recently published Codes of the Assyrians and the Hittites, the Athenian laws of Solon, and the Twelve Tables of Roman law, all of which were exclusively Civil Codes, the presumption would be that the Mosaic Code formulated for Israel was not different from the others and dealt exclusively with civil matters. There is no other way for the historian to judge than by analogy.</page><page sequence="5">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 411 However, such a conclusion from these historical analogies would be a fallacy. The compilers of the other Codes were purely interested in the civil problems of their commonwealths, and left the regulation of the religious matters in the hands of the priesthoods. But Moses was primarily a religious teacher, the Founder of Israel's religion-as gen- erally admitted-, and by virtue of this office, of necessity became Israel's Lawgiver for the purpose of regulating the conduct of his people according to the principles of their religion. Considering his religious activity, we must compare him-if a comparison be permissible at all- with Zoroaster or Buddha rather than with other lawgivers who com- piled Codes for their own peoples. Hence the omission of ecclesiastical statutes in his Code would seem inconceivable. The Book of the Coven- ant, which is essentially a Civil Code-and if any part of the Pentateuch bears the stamp of early antiquity and may reasonably be assigned to Mosaic authorship, it must be true of this Book-contains indeed a number of ecclesiastical regulations, which we would not expect to find in a Code of that kind, but for its religious character. But the regulations found in the Book of the Covenant consist of ceremonial laws that pertain to the daily duties of the people at large, as observance of Sabbath and of Festivals, the giving of the first fruits, and others. There are, however, ecclesiastical mnatters in which the people at large are not interested in the least and are not expected to know anything about such, as the rituals connected with the sacrifices. The average man of today is not expected to know how to conduct a divine service, which is the function of the spiritual leaders-though some voluntarily acquire such a knowledge-and the same is true of all ancient peoples and also of Israel. Hence historically it is not likely that a Code intended for the people at large should have included mat- ters of that kind, However, on the other hand, Moses could not have established Israel's religion on a firm and pure basis without having at the same time regulated the rituals of the sacrifices in accordance with the religious principles. Now it might seem complimentary to the personality of Israel's Lawgiver to credit him with the intention of abolishing sac- rifices altogether as a low and barbarous form of service to God, and establishing his religion on a purely ethical basis. But this is far from being a compliment to his practical sense. A great leader must know his own age and his own people, and must temnper his personal ideas and ideals to the prevailing conceptions, lest his labors be in vain. The belief that the Deity must be propitiated and honored by sacrifices was so</page><page sequence="6">412 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW general and so deeply rooted among all races of antiquity, that a creed without this feature would have been inconceivable and doomed from the very outset. Hence there is no room for doubt that sacrifices played just as important a part in Israel's cult as in those of all other ancient nations. But the objectionable features in the rituals of idolatrous sacrifices, especially in those of the Canaanites, were scarcely unknown to Moses, who could not but safeguard his people against such a contagion. There- fore it would be inconceivable that he should have neglected the regula- tion of these rituals that were of such import for the preservation of Israel's creed in Canaan. Israel's pre-Mosaic belief was surely far from being free from idolatrous conceptions, and the same inust be true of their sacrificial rituals. They had to undergo a thorough revision, and features incompatible with the ethical ideas of Israel's religion had to be eliminated. The priests entrusted with the function of offering sacrifices had to be taught these revised ceremonies. For the priests alone, and for none else, were the minute details of the sacrificial ceremonies, which had a symbolic character, of high importance. We may thus rest as- sured that the priests possessed a Torah of their own in which these minute details were elaborated. But while this Book containing the reg- ulation of the sacrifices may reasonably be claimed as Mosaic, it would be against historical analogy to contend that matters exclusively in- tended for the priesthood should have been from the very outset incor- porated in a Code intended for the people at large, and thereby should have become generally known. Among the Babylonians, Egyptians, Indians, Iranians, and no doubt among all other ancient nations with established priesthoods, the priests were the depositaries of all existing science both ecclesiastical and secular. Their hold upon the people they chiefly retained through their superior knowledge. Owing to the latter, the people looked up to them with high reverence, as the mediators between the gods and men, believed them to approach nearer to the deity than other mortals. They constituted the supreme authority on the point of law and religion, and were especially the teachers of the people in all religious matters. They were the very representatives of civilization among their nations. It would be a truism to assert that it was the same in Israel, as seen from the biblical records (Deut 17, 8-13; 21, 5; 33,10). It is not with- out significance that the function of the priesthood as accredited teachers of Israel is placed before that of sacrifices (ibid. 33, 10), from which we may gather that they were primarily the teachers of Israel's religion,</page><page sequence="7">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 413 the preservation of which would be due to them. Hosea attributed the general depravity of the people and their ignorance of the knowledge of the Lord to the criminal negligence of the priesthood in the exercise of this function. The non-Levitical priests of North Israel in superseding the Levites accepted likewise the charge of teaching, and the ethical laws of Israel were identical with those of Judah. Micah accounted it to the priests as a crime that they refused to teach without recompense (2, 11). Both Isaiah and Micah considered the Sanctuary of Jerusalem as the seat of learning. If the Priests constituted the Supreme Court of Appeal in Israel, it stands to reason that not only in the matter of interpretation of the laws was their knowledge superior to that of the common judges, but that they possessed also sources of information which the learned men in Israel were not supposed to know. We may, therefore, reason- ably assume that their own Torah, which they consulted on legal ques- tions brought before their forum, contained all the laws of Israel in a more elaborate and thorough form than the Codes intended for the information of the people at large. Owing to the primary function of the priesthood as teachers of Israel's religion, a thorough knowledge of the history of their people was for them indispensable. In the prophetic exhortations we meet with frequent references to Israel's past. The priests in the same way did not and could not limit their instruction to the doctrines of their religion, without accounting for them in the light of history. Numerous religious observances involved historical questions. They could not proclaim the God of Israel as the Creator of the universe, without giving an account of the story of creation. Nor could they claimi Israel as the chosen peo- ple of the Lord, without tracing the origin of their people from the dawn of history. As a matter of fact, history must have been the principal subject of their instruction, and we may rest assured that these historical matters were not omitted in their priestly Torah, the primary source of their own knowledge. In such a Torah, exclusively intended for the priesthood as a manual, we would not expect the laws in a systematic order, as in other Codes of laws, but arranged historically, in process of legislation, interspersed with historical references, which shed light on their enactment, also mixed with interpretations and here and there, if necessary, even repetitions. Furthermore, in an historical presentation of the Mosaic period, we would of course expect, as a matter of record, the description of the Tabernacle with its implements, the sacred vestments of the priests, and the rituals performed on their induction. These matters were of</page><page sequence="8">414 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW specific interest and importance for the priesthood. Their claim to con- stitute the legitimate priests of Israel, which was by no means generally conceded, was so closely connected with the erection of the first sanc- tuary in the wilderness, that without a historical account of the latter, their own origin would appear spurious and fictitious. As far as the people at large were concerned, the description of the Tabernacle could serve no practical purpose, seeing that it was merely a temporary sanc- tuary during Israel's sojourn in the wilderness, and of no further use when Israel settled finally in the land of Canaan, though its mnaterial or some of it may have been used for the permanent sanctuary at Shiloh. Thus its description differed from that of Solomon's Temple, in the first Book of Kings, which was no doubt intended for the purpose of serving as a model for future architects to rebuild it in the same way. What- ever doubt scholars may raise concerning the historical character of the Tabernacle, there can be no doubt that in a priestly Torah such a de- scription must have existed already in pre-exilic times, since without it the priests could not have accounted for their own origin. Since Vatke it has become an article of faith with the radical critics that the priestly ordinances and narratives contained in the Pen- tateuch are later than all the other Documents of which it is composed. This standard view is based upon the argument that in the author of the Priestly Code we recognize a man of a legal and reasoning turn of mind, whose theology and views are far too advanced to be assigned to an early and primitive period. However, may it not be taken for granted that the Babylonian priests of the Hammurabi period, of whom no doubt many were active in the codification of the Babylonian laws, were far inore advanced in civilization and possessed a higher knowl- edge than the people at large of the Neo-Babylonian period? Should not the same hold true of the early priests of Israel, that they were far more advanced in all religious and legal matters than the Hebrews at large of the 9th and 8th centuries who are held to have produced the Jahvistic and Elohistic Documents? Should their own ideas of God not have been superior to the popular conceptions which the critics find in these Documents? The priests, whose sole occupation was the study and teaching of Israel's laws, must needs have acquired a legal and logical turn of niind, totally different from that of the people at large. They were scholars and thinkers, whose only aim was to preserve the purity of Israel's religion, and they may indeed have looked askance at some biblical narratives, dating no doubt from a pre-Mosaic period, in which the Deity appears visibly in human form. The people at large,</page><page sequence="9">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 415 however, do not meditate and reflect upon religious conceptions, but judge by outward appearance, and are naturally attracted by the beauty and poetical charm of narratives of that kind. Being popular, these nar- ratives could not be ignored by the priests. Yet who knows whether these anthropomorphic narratives did not greatly conrtibute to lead the people away from the Mosaic religious conceptions? The same gulf that existed in late Judaism between the conceptions of the Rabbis and those of the so-called 'Am-ha-arez, we may presume for all the earlier periods of Israel's existence. There was a continual struggle between the ad- herents of the syncretistic Jahveh-religion and the priests as the very representatives of the Mosaic religion. Thus it is a fundamental error and an historical misconception to see in the Priestly Code an exilic or post-exilic- innovation. It would lead us too far to trace the activity of the priesthood from the very outset during the period of the Judges and to show historically in detail that it could have been of no marked success in a land where most of the localities in which the former population survived possessed their own ancient sanctuaries, which were soon adopted by the Israelites. Nor can we dwell upon their vicissitudes during the period of the Mon- archy. It stands to reason that in North Israel, the activity of the Levitical priests ceased altogether. No ancient government would have permitted the dissemination of doctrines which condemned the state religion and undermined thereby the loyalty of the subjects. A some- what similar condition must have prevailed under the idolatrous rulers of the Southern Kingdom. The erection of the Central Sanctuary in Jerusalem, which effected the close association of the Levitical priests with worldly power, was for the former not an unmixed blessing, and not infrequently tended to impair their prestige and influence among the people. In their eyes, Temple and Palace constituted a single institu- tion, and the priests were held responsible for the actions of the govern- ment. The people must have looked with disdain upon the doctrines of the spiritual leaders, branded as associates of tyrants and oppressors, though as a matter of fact they did not have the least influence with the government. In a later period, which probably began with the reign of Jehoram and reached its climax with the reign of Ahaz, when the nobility had become all powerful, and right and justice had become terms with- out meaning, the activity of the priests as teachers of the people must almost have ceased. We may rest assured that the nobility took good care that the oppressed people should not become imbued with notions which might bring about the overthrow of their domination. Under</page><page sequence="10">416 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW these conditions, the priestly teachings were totally unknown to the people at large both in Judah and in Israel. We may even doubt whether the non-Levitical prophets possessed an exact knowledge of these mat- ters. Now anmong the Babyloniaiis, Assyrians, Egyptians, Hittites, and no doubt also among other civilized nations, the chief sanctuaries, if not all of them, were furnished with libraries, which were intended for the special instruction of the priesthoods, though they were used also as archives for the preservation of legal documents. It stands to reason that the same custom prevailed also in Israel. The chief sanctuaries of Jerusalem, Bethel, Dan, and probably also all the others, possessed libraries of their own. It goes without saying that the contents of the religious books of each Temple-Library were in full agreement with the religious conceptions and rites believed in and practised in each sanc- tuary. In Babylonia we would not expect in the Library of Ur a religious text in which Shamash is proclaimed as chief god; nor would we expect to find in Sippar a religious text in which Sin is presented as chief god. The same holds true of all Temple-Libraries in all other countries and also of those in Israel. The priests of each sanctuary took good care that their religious literature should not be contrary to the prevailing religious conceptions, so that nothing of a heretical nature was found there. In the literature found in the various Libraries of Israel and Judah we may see the literary sources from which the biblical historians drew their information. Though in the Mosaic Books there is scarcely anything that may be attributed to the libraries of North Israel, the literature of the latter must be regarded as a first source of information for other historical Books of the Old Testament. This is especially true of the Book of Judges, and large parts of the Books of Samuel and Kings. This fact fully answers the arguments of Reuss, Vatke, Wellhausen and their followers, that the Mosaic laws of the Pentateuch had not yet existed in the periods of the authors of Judges, Samuel and Kings. As a mnatter of fact, no shred of evidence for the critical theory remains, if we as- sume that the narratives in these Books contrary to the laws of the Pentateuch had been taken from the libraries of North Israel. We leave it to the reader to investigate these narratives in detail in the light of our assumption. As far as the Library of the Temple of Jerusalem is concerned, it may also be taken for granted that no literature was found there that was not in full agreement with the priestly Torah. While we know nothing about the fate of the Libraries of North Israel, whether some</page><page sequence="11">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 417 of them survived the downfall of the state, which is not unlikely, there can be no doubt about the fate of the Jerusalem Library. If we may be- lieve the testimony of the biblical records concerning the deeds of Ma- nasseh, we cannot but look upon him as the arch-enemy of the religion of Israel, whose aim was to extirpate the Jahveh-religion, and see in him the very precursor of Antiochus Epiphanes. We may rest assured that like the latter, Manasseh and his counsellors extended their zealous activity against the Jahveh-worship to the sacred literature, which was a source of inspiration to those who opposed him. The existence of such a literature, which by divine authority condemned their conduct as the most abominable iniquity and inflicted the penalty of death upon its perpetrators, might become a dangerous weapon in the hands of zealous worshippers of Jahveh. For their own safety, they could not but order the destruction of this literature. Should such a literature be suffered to remain in the very place where Manasseh put up his abom- inations? Thus the destruction of the Books of this Library may be taken as a matter of course. On the other hand, it is quite reasonable to expect the preserva- tion of a copy of these Priestly Torahs by one of the priests who had secret information of the intention of the government and succeeded in concealing it in the wall or some other secret place, so that it escaped the general destruction of the religious literature. The priests were bet- ter acquainted with the secret recesses of the Temple than the royal officers who were entrusted with the destruction of the Library. It stands to reason that if there existed other biblical documents of a non- priestly character, as the Jahvistic and Elohistic literature, the exis- tence of which the critics assume as a matter of fact, they must have been safely hidden away by their possessors during this period, as their possession meant certain death. Thus this literature-if it existed at all-must have likewise disappeared with that of the Temple Library, and was unknown to the people at large. The same must of course be true of the prophetic utterances. Thus during a period of about half a century, the people were al- most completely without religious instruction of the Mosaic Laws, as this teaching was strictly forbidden, being contrary to the religious principles which the ruling dynasty of that period endeavored to foster in Judah. We may even doubt whether the priests themselves retained any knowledge of these matters, seeing that their source of information was lost. As such a knowledge was dependent upon tradition, it was merely fragmlientary. During this long period, many of the priests suc-</page><page sequence="12">418 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW cumbed to the prevailing religious conceptions, and officiated in the idolatrous sanctuaries. It goes without saying that the activity of Ma- nasseh was not restricted to the Temple of Jerusalem. All the Bamoth in Judah were changed into idolatrous sanctuaries. Therefore the Le- vitical priests officiating there during his reign were later under Josiah excluded from officiating in the Temple of Jerusalem. Critics erroneously ascribe their exclusion to the jealousy of the priests of Jerusalem. It is highly significant that we have no record of a prophet that rose dur- ing the reign of Manasseh and of Amon, which shows that no prophet dared to pursue his religious activity, and if one did, he was soon silenced by death. The discovery of a copy of the Mosaic Books under the reign of Josiah by the High Priest Hilkiah who was entrusted with the repairs of the Temple, in a place where for centuries had flourished a religious Library for the instruction of the priesthood, is quite natural. On the contrary, it would have been strange if the priests without exception should have suffered their religious literature to perish without leaving a trace behind it. The priests raised under the reign of the pious king Hezekiah could not have been so indifferent to their religious conceptions as not to have attempted to save at least one copy of their sacred litera- ture. We may rest assured that the copy hidden away was not taken at random from the Temple-Library, but was one of the most complete and highly valued works, so that it contained not only all the ordinances pertaining to the priestly office, but also all other Mosaic laws, as well as all historical traditions coricerning Israel's origin and religion, which the priests as teachers and guardians of the Mosaic religion were re- quired to know. It is needless to say that it contained also the Book of Deuteronomy. The current critical view that the Book of the Law discovered under Josiah was the Book of Deuteronomy lacks all evidence and is merely a hypothesis, as without such an assumption there would be no Doc- umentary Theory. No argument is needed if we reject the latter. Never- theless we may call attention to one argument that in puerility has no equal, and yet it is mentioned in all textbooks that deal with this prob- lem. The critics say that the discovered book must have been a short volume, since it was read twice in one day, by Shaphan the scribe, once in the Temple, and once when he took it to the king. But where does the biblical narrator indicate that these two readings occurred in one and the same day? Would the narrator not have used the same words: "and Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it," if it had</page><page sequence="13">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 419 taken Shaphan months to read it through? Is there anyneed of assum- ing that Shaphan made his official report to the king concerning this discovery on the same day, and not weeks later after convincing him- self of its genuine character? If the biblical writer states that Jacob left Bethel in the morning and arrived at Haran early in the afternoon, does he mean to indicate that the whole journey from Bethel to Haran lasted only several hours as the Midrash indeed declares? Was not the read- ing of a few chapters sufficient to convince oneself of the nature of the discovered Book of the Law? Thus in investigating the question on historical lines from an unbiased point of view, the linguistic criteria upon which the Documentary Theo- ry rests lose their import altogether. The Priestly Torah itself could not but have been of a composite character, as we have pointed out, having been partly or wholly revised, rewritten, commented upon, by genera- tioiis of scribes during many centuries from the earliest period. That the Jerusalem Library may have contained many variations, and numerous attempts at harmonizing them may safely be presupposed. Nor can there be any evidence from the Historical Books that the Mosaic Laws had niot existed during the whole pre-exilic period, as their compilers drew their sources of information largely from the Temple-Libraries of North Israel, where a syncretistic religion was in practice. However, though the present writer is absolutely convinced that modern biblical criticismn is thoroughly defective and is a stumbling-block on the way of a true uinderstanding of Old Testament and religion, he considers himself far from being so prejudiced as not to appreciate biblical studies written from a critical standpoint, and his endeavor in reviewing books of that kind will be as just as possible. He is well aware of the fact that he does not do this work exclusively for people that share his own point of view. II. INTRODUCTIONS AND EXEGESIS 1. While at present radical criticism still reigns supreme in the domain of biblical literature and holds its sway undiminished, signs are not wanting of an undercurrent of dissatisfaction and opposition among its advocates, which if given free vent would undermine and overturn 'Introduction to the Old Testament. By Dr. E. SELLIN. Translated by W. MONT- GOMERY, M.A., B.D. With an Introduction and a Bibliography for English readers. By Prof. A. S. PEAKE, D.D. New York: George H. Doran Company. 1923, pp. X + .271.</page><page sequence="14">420 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW its rule. Among others, such an indication may be seen in SELLIN'S Introductiont to the Old Testament. Its author is internationally known as an excavator, explorer, archaeologist and biblical commentator. Con- sidering the destructive tendencies prevailing at present in biblical studies, the present work may be regarded as a first step in the direction of constructive biblical criticism. Though on the whole taking the posi- tion of the advanced critical school, on very important points the author balks at accepting all its dictates and expresses views which from the standpoint of the radical critics are reactionary and shocking heresies. As a matter of fact, even where he fully accepts the current views, we can often read between the lines that it is not done whole-heartedly, but under stress of circumstances, and if he had his own way, he would willingly part company with his radical colleagues. As already observed, it requires superhuman strength to resist the influence of the age and environment, and to hold views which are utterly rejected and ridiculed by one's own contemporaries and close associates, for scholars are after all also human. For instance, the author admits as very probable that the whole representation of the history given by the Priestly Code is an exilic revision of a pre-exilic historical book of priestly origin, and that the priestly historical record, out of which the historical narrative of P has developed, had attained to fixity at least as early as the period of the monarchy (p. 85). This is certainly a concession of the utmost impor- tance that we would not expect from a modern critic, as he plainly admits that in the Priestly Code may be seen one of the earliest biblical records. A revision of an ancient record in writing would not stamp P as an exilic creation. He further concedes the historical character of the whole law of the Tabernacle (p. 87 ff.) and the description of it which, since Wellhausen branded it as pure fiction, has been regarded by the advanced critics with the tenacity of a dogma of faith as a reflection of the Temple, projected back into the days of the wilderness. With regard to the dating of the Jahvistic and Elohistic Documents, the author radically deviates from the current critical views. While assigning the Jahvistic Document to the period of David and Solomon, he admits that it is only the lower limit for the date of the materials of which the Document is composed; but the individual narratives must previously, centuries earlier, have acquired a more or less fixed form, and some of them may have been already fixed in writing (p. 60). But the writer might just as well have assigned this Document to the Mosaic period and maintained that it was revised in the days of David and</page><page sequence="15">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 421 Solomon. He might have said the same of the Elohistic Document, con- cerning which he asserts that there are positive arguments which prove that the narrative material was complete before the Division of the Kingdom (p. 67f.). As to individual narratives, he assigns both the Blessings of Jacob and Moses to the period of the Judges (pp. 34, 38). Of the Song of Triumph at the Red Sea, he declares 1-3; 4-10 to belong to the samie historical era as the events which it celebrates, and maintains that it nmust have been expanded from the earlier shorter form soon after Israel had got a firm footing in Palestine (p. 35). He denies that in verses 13.17 there is a reference to the Jerusalem Temple. He further regards also a whole series of shorter poetic formulae as dating from the time when Israel came out of the wilderness into Canaan (p. 35f.). Concerning the date of Deuteronomy, though accepting the current view, which identifies it with the Book of the Law discovered under the reign of Josiah, the author absolutely disagrees with the general critical view that it was composed at the time of its discovery, contending that it was the Temple Law upon which Hezekiah's reform was based (p. 74ff.). But his arguments that it cannot have been an ancient Mosaic or even a Solomonic writing are rather shallow and show a historical misconception. Yet we fully understand his difficult position, as he is anxious to preserve the existence of the Documentary Theory. However, the most startling view, which is absolutely contrary to that of the critical school, of which Cornill wittily said that the author wishes to have the omelette but to refrain from breaking his eggs, is his acceptance of both the Decalogue and the Book of the Covenant as Mosaic. Cornill's criticism is not unfounded, but the parable is some- what incorrect. The author does not "wish" and has no cravings for the omelette, and eats it only because all the others are doing it, merely complying with the dominant fashion and prevailing ideas, and he would cast away the critical premises, if he could follow his own inclinations. He further contends that even the Jahvist was acquainted with this Decalogue, and definitely denies the existence of a Jahvistic Decalogue in Ex. 34, 10-27-a view generally held by modern critics, which has a most important bearing on the historical character of the Stone Tablets in the Ark of the Covenant. Moreover, the author goes even so far as to recognize pre-Mosaic historical sources. Thus of Genesis 14, which modern critics, with a very few exceptions, regard as a later Midrash, written for the purpose of glorifying Abraham and Jerusalem, he holds that everything points to its being a translation of a Canaanitic record which was deposited</page><page sequence="16">422 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW in the archives of Jerusalem some time about the 15th century B. C. E., in cuneiform writing, and fell into the hand of David when he captured Jebus (p. 49f.). For the date of the Noachian oracles (Gen. 9, 25-27), he suggests a pre-Mosaic period. The author's position, more in harmony with traditional views on some points, is seen not only in the treatment of the Pentateuch but also in that of the Psalms. He does not follow the lead of Wellhausen that all of them are of post-exilic origin, asserting that the nucleus of the Davidic collection 3-41; 51-72, belongs to the pre-exilic period, and was the book of prayers and hymns which Judah took with them into exile (pp. 195-202), and he cannot see any reason why this collection should not contain actual Davidic Psalms. He further doubts whether any Maccabean Psalms are included in the Psalter, observing that while there is in principle no reason why there should not be a few Maccabeai Psalms, their presence has certainly not been proved (p. 205). In pointing out these views of the author, it is far from our inten- tion to class him among the conservative scholars, as others unjustly do, according to PEAKE, in the Introduction of this work. On most of the other matters, the author fully accepts extremely radical views. For instance, he is inclined to place the Song of Moses-one of the most beautiful gems of the Pentateuch-in the Greek period, provided that it is not admitted to belong to E2(38). He further reaches the startling conclusion that Moses was martyred by the Israelites in the Wilderness, and finds evidence of a persistent tradition to that effect, in seeing in him the subject of "the Servant of the Lord" passages in Deutero- Isaiah, and insisting that this individual Servant is none other than Moses himself who suffered a martyr's death in Shittim (143). By such views the author certainly atones for his conservative escapades and shows that he is by no means a deserter from the radical camp. The import of his concessions lies in the fact that they do not come from a conservative scholar but from a member in good standing of the critical school. We may well expect other advanced scholars to follow his example, in re-examining fearlessly theories which hitherto were held as beyond the shadow of doubt. In doing so, they will recognize the fundamental error of modern criticism, which isolates the religion and the literature of the Old Testament and treats its development as being largely due to forces operating within Israel itself. The work is divided into three parts in accordance with the three Divisions of the Old Testament, and contains two Appendices dealing with the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, a chronologically arranged</page><page sequence="17">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 423 Synopsis of the development of Old Testament Literature, two Biblio- graphies of German and English books, and an Index. It was translated into English from the thoroughly revised and enlarged third German edition, published in 1920, and the author made additions to the English translation. The subject-matter is well arranged, the controversies are lucidly presented, and the language is fluent and easy, for which the translator MONTGOMERY deserves no small credit. Though from a con- servative standpoint we cannot but take exception to most of the views expressed, we must not be blind to its high merits, and must give credit where due. As a matter of fact, it may be regarded as far superior in every respect to any other textbook on biblical criticism. It may safely be recommended to students whose minds are still open with regard to critical problems, and who wish to get an insight into the theories on which modern biblical criticism is based. If they read this book care- fully, not only the conclusions but also the discussion given in smaller print, they will plainly recognize the slender threads on which far- reaching conclusions hang. 2. More thoroughgoing is a work of a prominent representative of Wellhausen's School, MEINHOLD'S Einfuehrung in das Alte Testament. The author is well known as one of the most radical exponents of biblical criticism, and also in this book runs true to form. According to his views, the Canon is the product of post-exilic Judaism, and was wholly or partly unknown to ancient Israel. The only creed of Israel in an early period was: "Jahveh is the God of Israel, and Israel are the people of Jahveh", and this surely cannot be regarded as a "Creed" (Bekenntnis) in the later sense of the term, nor as a Sacred Writing. Some are in- clined to see in the Decalogue the sum and substance of the fundamental principles of Israel's religion, Israel's creed, and this was the earliest Sacred Writing. But even if Moses had received the Decalogue from God, it could not have been considered Israel's Creed. For it is obvious that a Code that was never used by the ancient writers, nor was ever mentioned by the prophets, could not have become the creed of Israel. The Priestly Code accounts for its being unknown, because the Tablets of the Decalogue were placed in the Ark, and thus were inac- cesible to the people. But we should think that such Tablets ought to have been publicly exposed like the Code of Hammurabi or the Twelve Roman Tables. 2Einfuihrung in das Alte Testament (Geschichte, Literatur und Religion Israels). Von D. JOHANNES MEINHOLD. Giessen: Verlag von ALFRED TOPELMANN, pp. VIII + 316.</page><page sequence="18">424 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW However, if the Decalogue was never in existence, Israel did not possess any ethical principles. If so, on what basis and with what right dared the prophets to condemn Israel for its moral defects? If the original creed of Israel was merely the worship of Jahveh, this worship did not impose upon them any restrictions in dealing with their fellow- men! Moreover, in his arguments, the author seems to have forgotten the contents of the Decalogue. If Jahveh from the very beginning was the exclusive God of Israel, the first three commandinents of the Deca- logue must have been known to them. The fourth commandment con- cerning observance Qf Sabbath was certainly known in pre-exilic times, as Amos 8, 5, and the Second Book of Kings 4, 23 testify. The fifth commandment concerning honoring father and mother is the basis of several laws in the Code of Hammurabi, and this conception was cer- tainly Semitic, and must have been well known to Israel. The sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, are the foundation of civilized society. In the Code of Hammurabi, theft, adultery, bearing false witness are punished with death. Were these things quite unknown to the ancient writers and the prophets? Or is the author so sure that the prophets were unacquainted with the tenth commandment: Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's property? Yet the prophets emphasized the duties of the heart, and even Samuel declared that "the Lord looketh on the heart". It is certainly extremely daring to compare the Code of Hammurabi, which contains hundreds of laws admitting of various interpretations, or the Roman Tables of a similar character, with the Ten Commandments, which are so plain and simple, requiring no interpretation, that a child could learn them in one lesson. Suppose that they had been exposed in the Temple, what could the Israelites learn from them that was formerly unknown. Regarded as being of the most sacred character, it is natural that the Israelites should have taken the utmost care of the Tables as the most precious memorial of the Covenant on Sinai. It is indeed a surprise that a prominent scholar should draw such flimsy conclusions. The author continues to say that though the Book of the Covenant (Ex. 20, 23-23) inay be rather old, and was intended for the judges rather than for the common people, it cannot be regarded as "Sacred Writings". It may well have claimed divine origin, for in all ancient beliefs justice was intimately connected with religion, since the priests gave their decisions in the names of their gods, and decided doubtful cases by means of a divine oracle. Moses being the ancestor of the Israelitish priests, the ancient laws were ascribed to him who received them from God. Hammurabi likewise claimed to have received the laws of his</page><page sequence="19">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 425 Code from his god Marduk. Nevertheless the Code of this king was not looked upon by the Babylonians and Assyrians as "Sacred Writ- ings". The same is true also of the Book of the Covenant. But where did the author get this remarkable information that the Babylonians did not regard the Code of Hammurabi as one of their most sacred writings, written down by command of their supreme god Marduk? One who reads carefully the Prologue and the Epilogue of this Code must arrive at quite a different conclusion. Moreover, if Hamniurabi claimed to have received his laws from Marduk, may not Moses have done the same in promulgating the Book of the Covenant in the name of Jahveh, and we ought not to deny its Mosaic authorship. Furthermore, how can we compare these two Codes? That of Hammu- rabi was an exclusively Civil Code, and thus may or may not have had a religious or sacred character. But the Book of the Covenant, which the author strictly defines as comprising Ex. 20, 23-23, contains a large number of purely religious ordinances, and thus could not but be re- garded as "Sacred Writings". He would have to go further and declare these religious ordinances as later additions to the original Book of the Covenant. But where is the evidence for such a contention? Finally, even a casual reader would recognize that the laws of this Code were not exclusively intended for the judges but for the people at large. Thus also on this point the statements of the author are rather superficial. The author further declares that, just as little as the ancient law- givers, did the prophets intend to create "Sacred Writings" by the compilation of their oracles. They were men of action. Their intention was to lead the people by the word of Jahveh, and they neither knew nor desired "Sacred Writings". Their existence is due to their disciples who wanted "Sacred Writings" and produced them. Having addressed themselves in vain to the free will of the people, these prophets per- ceived that neither persuasion nor threats nor promises will bring the people back to God, and if they should not perish completely, they must be forced to forsake their evil ways by the promulgation of laws. It was necessary to remould the ideas of the old Prophets into legal terms, and to reform the cult and the whole life of the people according to these ideas, and thereby form a constitution and impose it forcibly upon the people. The lawbook they produced was the Book of Deuter- onomy. It must be borne in mind that according to this author and almiost all followers of Wellhausen, the original Book of Deuteronomy consisted of chapters 12-26.</page><page sequence="20">426 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Now there can be no room for doubt that the prophets looked askance at sacrifices and rituals, if they did not disapprove of them alto- gether, as did Amos, Isaiah, Micah and Jeremiah. They were undoubt- edly correct. If the Rabbis had lived in that period, they would have done the same. Sacrifices and rituals, which have merely a symbolic signification, to keep in the mind of the people of Israel their close union with the Lord, became with the people at large, in the period of the prophets, the sum and substance of their religion, and its ethical postulates, its fundamental principles, were disregarded altogether. Under such circumstances, the prophets were forced to deny that sacri- fices and rituals constituted a part of Israel's religion. There is a rab- binic interpretation of Psalm 119,126: "If it is time to work for the Lord, the Law may be made void". This was actually the principle of the prophets. Sacrifices and rituals were never intended by the Law- giver of Israel to be made the basis of Israel's religion, and if the people did so, the laws concerning them' were automatically void. If, however, the people should mend their ways, and become ethically pure, and look upon sacrifices and rituals as purely symbolic, these laws would be automatically restored. Surely the prophets would never have pro- tested against sacrifices, if the people had been ethically religious! Now a casual perusal of Deuteronomy 12-26 would demonstrate that the largest part of it deals with sacrifices and rituals, and the other part with legal customs that are by no means of prophetic origin, and that it contains only a sprinkling of ethical conceptions that we might ascribe to the teachings of the prophets. How shall we account for the dis- loyalty of the compilers to their prophetic teachers, in that they disre- garded their views to such an extent as to make sacrifices, rituals, and other custonis not of prophetic origin the foundation of Israel's con- stitution? As a matter of fact, the real prophetic conceptions are found in Deuteronomy 1-11. But this part is assigned to the Deuteronoinistic School and is dated from the exilic period. We see again the fallacy of the author's conclusions. The author in his arguments disregards the influence of the environment altogether. Babylonia, Egypt and other ancient nations certainly possessed "Sacred Writings" centuries or millenniums before Israel had come into existence. Was there any reason why the prophets should have had any objection to prepare for the people of Israel "Sacred Writings" which should teach them the duties of daily life? It is surely not complimentary to Israel's Prophets to say that they wanted to keep the people dependent upon their own oracles. It would mean that they wanted to keep the people in ignorance</page><page sequence="21">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 427 to make themselves indispensable. That may be said of the Babylonian and Egyptian priests, not of Israel's prophets! However, it is noteworthy that the author at least in one point deviates from Wellhausen and his followers in that he accuses neither the compilers of Deuterononiy nor those of the Priestly Code of fraud, but holds that they actually believed that these Books contained Mosaic traditions. But on this point also his views are illogical. It is certainly disingenuous to ascribe books to Moses because they contain some parts of Mosaic origin. But the whole discussion of this subject by all the critics is gratuitous. We may truly apply to them the homely saying: They could not see the forest because of the trees. All of them actually seem to have overlooked a most important fact. In the whole narrative of the discovery of the Book of the Law, there is no allusion to the Mosaic origin of the discovered Book, nor is it stated that it dated from the period of Moses. Neither Hilkiah, nor Shaphan, nor the compiler of the Book of Kings says one word to that effect. Such a statement is first made by the Book of Chronicles (II, 34, 14), which of course identified this Book with the Pentateuch. Thus how can one say that the compilers intended to impose upon the king if they did not claim for it Mosaic authorship? They did not express any opinion concerning the age of the Book. The very fact that the finders of the Book did not ascribe it to Moses may be taken as a further confirmation that it was not the Book of Deuteronomy. This Book is written in such a style and deals with such matters prior to the entrance of Israel, that any unbiased reader who does not suspect its authenticity would take it as a matter of fact that it originated before Israel settled in Canaan, so that Hilkiah, Shap- han and the compiler of the Book of Kings would have designated it as "the Book of the Law of Moses", as did the author of Chronicles. But if the discovered Book was a Priestly Manual, containing all biblical traditions, and even many matters of post-Mosaic times, as the present writer has pointed out, they could not have ascribed it to Moses, and therefore called it the Book of the Law, or as it should perhaps be more correctly rendered: "The Book of Instruction". In dealing with the history and literature of ancient Israel, the author declares that the beginnings of the people of Israel are shrouded in obscurity, and thus rejects the biblical traditions with regard to the prehistory of Israel as purely legendary and of no historical value. It is safe to assume, he says, that a part of the Semitic nomads in the Syrian- Arabian desert, especially those in the regions of the Sinai-peninsula,</page><page sequence="22">428 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW had entered Egypt, where they continued to lead a pastoral life, though under Egyptian suzerainty. It may be true that the Egyptians com- pelled them to work on their building constructions, and this demand of the Egyptians they answered by leaving Egypt and returning to their old home in the desert. On this occasion we meet with Moses as leader, whose personality and activity may be accepted as historical. In the desert, and not in Egypt, the foundation of Israel's later history was laid by Moses. The Semites, who forced their way from Egypt and freed themselves, notwithstanding their pursuit by the Egyptian war- riors, united themselves in the desert with Semitic Bedouins, who were their near relations. The power that held them together was the belief in Jahveh who had shown himself to them as their mighty patron deity, in their liberation from Egypt and their preservation in the desert. In the mission of Moses, calling upon them to leave Egypt and return to the desert, the Israelites recognized the call of their old desert-god, "the God of their fathers". This would not be contradictory to the fact that Moses was closely associated with the Midianites, and had taken over from them the name and the cult of Jahveh. That which Israel in the pre-Mosaic period knew and practised, but in Egypt neglected, Midian preserved and handed over to the Egyptian Seinites as some- thing new, which, however, was not new at all. These few passages will give the reader some indication of the author's conception of Israel's origin. The book consists of four parts, subdivided into chapters. The first deals with the origin of the Old Testament, the second, with the history and literature of Old Israel to the Division of the Kingdom, the third, with the history of the Divided Kingdom, and the fourth, with the Babylonian exile. Leaving aside the author's critical position, there can be no room for doubt that it is highly instructive and suggestive. Its style is clear and easy, the subject-matter is treated in a methodical way, and the discussions of the various critical views are attractive, for one interested in these matters. It would be an excellent Introduction to the Old Testament, but for the author's radical views concerning the composition of the Pentateuch, which are a disturbing element and fundamentally affect the interpretation of most of the Books of the Old Testament. However, this is a personal view of the reviewer, and believers in the critical views, far from regarding it as a defect, will see in it the right method of treating Old Testament religion and literature, and from such a point of view, it is indeed a prominent contribution to Old Testament textbooks.</page><page sequence="23">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 429 3. A book likewise severely critical, but the views of which are borrowed rather than original, is COHU'S The Bible and Modern Thought. It is intended for educated laymen, students and ordination-candidates. As its title implies, its aim is to place before the reader the present atti- tude of modern thought toward the vexed problems of the origin, com- position, and historical trustworthiness of the Old Testament. The author assures us that in his endeavor to keep abreast of nmodern biblical scholarship, he has read not only practically all the classical books, English and foreign, on the subject, but has also spent many years in trying to learn what God teaches us through science, comparative reli- gion, anthropology, folk-lore, etc.; for the Old Testament scholar who would keep abreast of his sXubject must spread his nets wide, if he is to gather in the available material for his studies. Now it is far from the mind of the reviewer to wound the author's susceptibilities by doubting his assurance. But it seemed to him rather strange that in looking through the Index he could find only the names of De Wette, Graf, Kuenen, and Wellhausen, of all the foreign Old Testament critics. Evidently the material of the scholars who wrote after Wellhausen's Prolegomena was not available or cannot be included among the classical books. We would not have referred to this fact, if the author had not presented his work as the quintessence of all knowledge and as being thus infallible. There is another point which we cannot pass without censure. The author's principal aim is to investigate the trustworthiness of the biblical records. Now it was the life-work of his own countryman, a member of his own Church, Bishop J. W. COLENSO, to investigate the truth of the biblical accounts, and his investigations exercised a great influence on Abraham Kuenen. If the author is so thoroughly acquainted with all the literature on biblical subjects, it seems strange that in his book there is not the least allusion to his predecessor in the same field of investigation, and there is not the least reference to his name and activity. An author setting himself up as arbitrator between Bible and inodern thought and claiming full authority in deciding in favor of the latter, ought to possess a good knowledge of the work that had been done in the same field by past generations! What a formidable title: The Bible and Modern Thought! The contents of the book do not belie it, as its fundamental principle is, that only that part of the Bible is acceptable which can be brought into harmony with modern thought. But what is "modern thought"? Each 'The Bible and Modern Thought. By the Rev. J. R. COHU, M.A. New York: E. P. DUTTON and CoMPANY, 1920. pp. X-341.</page><page sequence="24">430 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW of the past ages possessed its owii "modern thought", and all of them had come into collision with the Old Testament, since the very begin- ning of its existence. Is not the very term "modern thought" a boom- erang, just as dangerous to the existence of Christianity as to that of the Old Testament? There are a good many scientists to whom the terms "God, Soul, Immortality" are words without any real meaning, and in their eyes both Testaments, the Old and the New, are nothing but fairy tales. Shall they be recast in accordance with their own "modern thought"? The book consists of nineteen chapters. At the very starting poilit, the author makes the Founder of Christianity responsible for his own views, since he had restated large portions of the Old Testament and had cancelled others altogether, and was not blind to its moral short- comings. This is news, and one is never too old to learn. Until now it has been the general belief that Christianity conceived Jesus to have been the fulfillment of the Law, and thus the so-called Legalism had become obsolete, with the exception of the ethical laws, which a civi- lized society could not dispense with. He further points out the intel- lectual difficulties of the Bible: Intellectually, he says, we are out of touch with the Bible, because (1) its poetry is not our prose; (2) its history and science are often not .true to fact; (3) its first two chapters clearly contradict each other; (4) and many of its Books look like literary forgeries. But the second difficulty is to be explained, that the Bible sets the truth of idea far above the truth of fact. We protest against this statement. This is not an explanation, but an indictment! The author applies a Greek conception to the Old Testament. This was never that of Israel, neither in biblical times nor in the succeeding ages. An idea never changes falsehood into truth ! He proceeds to trace the different stages of Israel's religious development, gives the chrono- logical order of the composition of the biblical Books, and dwells on the Documentary Theory, Then he describes at length early man and his creed, and declares that the Hebrew race like other races passed through this prirmitive-stage, shared these beliefs and never quite forgot them. He continues to treat of Babylonia and its influence on Israel, and though the discussion does not display any originality, the subject is ably and well presented. In the treatment of Moses and the Exodus, he declares that from the day of the migration of the Hebrews to the days of Moses, we know next to nothing of their history. He accepts the views of the radical critics that only a part of the Israelites sojourned in Egypt, while others</page><page sequence="25">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 431 of their kinsrnen settled in the Sinaitic peninsula and worked up into Canaan independently. In accordance with these views, he does not doubt the historical character of Moses, but as to his activity, he can believe only that he made Jahveh Israel's God, bound Israel to Him by an awful and solemn covenant, and gave Israel some laws. These bare facts are certain; all further details misty. Later writers threw back into Moses' day the ideas and conditions prevalent in their own days, and assigned the views and laws of 800-500 B. C. E. to Moses himself. The age of Moses and that of the Judges he designates the Dawn of Israel's history. Of prophetic inspiration and their messages he says that God spoke to them exactly as He speaks to us all, from within their own mind and heart. No comment is necessary. It would be surely a strange procedure on the part of the Godhead to impart to each individual, Jew, Catholic, Protestant, Mohammedan, etc., rnes- sages contradicting and condemning one another. Any man would be justified in proclaiming his own ideas in the name of the Godhead. In divesting the author's discussions of the religious phraseology in which they are steeped, and which he deemed necessary, as otherwise they would sound nothing short of blasphemy and of an agnostic charac- ter, we can see that according to his conceptions the Old Testament as a whole is a pious pragmatism. However, though the author's knowledge of modern biblical litera- ture is far from being thorough and extensive as he imagines, but on the contrary, of a rather limited character, if we may judge from this book, there can be no difference of opinion that he possesses a masterly pen, and knows how to produce a readable book, the style of which is simple, lucid and attractive. It is more the pity that owing to its at- tractive style it will lead astray naive readers to accept his destructive and superficial deductions. 4. However, the preceding works may be regarded as mild and tame in their critical tendencies, if compared with BERNFELD'S Introduction to the Old Testament, written in Hebrew, and entitled r7pn 'nnz K1mn. It seem-s to be the last word in negative, destructive, and irreverent Biblical Criticism, and we cannot see how any one could go further. Yet it may seem strange, that notwithstanding its extremely radical tendency, it is not based upon the Documentary Theory. The author denies that we are able to separate the various sources by the criterion 'VITp;l lz117 RI= (Introduction to the Sacred Writings).

Linguistic criteria are merely of some help here and there to such an investigation. It is his contention that the Revelation on Sinai or Horeb, recorded in the Elohistic, Jahvistic, and Deuteronomistic Docu- ments, was unknown in pre-exilic times, as the prophets knew nothing about it, and all these narratives are pure inventions dating from the exilic and post-exilic periods. He holds that the earliest Biblical Docu- ment was the Book of the Covenant, Exodus 21-23, and a part of 24; the second Book of the Covenant, currently assigned to JE (Ex. 34), belongs to a later period. The Decalogue he does not include in the Book of the Covenant, as he denies its Mosaic or pre-exilic existence, and assigns it to the exilic period. He maintains that the Torah (post- exilic) was originally a pure Code of laws, which towards the end of the Persian period, about a hundred years after Ezra and Nehemiah, was put in an historical framework. He denies that the Book of Deuteronomy was discovered under the reign of Josiah, but maintains that it was a letter of exhortations, comprising Deuteronomy 28, that was found in the Temple, and for this purpose the Book of Deuteronomy was written to define the laws upon which Josiah's covenant was based; that later in exilic times an Introduction was "invented" and added to the original Book, and it was likewise concluded with a historical narrative reaching to the death of Moses. With regard to the Priestly Code, the author's view is that there had been three different versions; the first was ascribed to Ezekiel, that is found in his Book; the second was that which was known in the period of Ezra and Nehemiah, of which only one fragment survived; and the third version was composed toward the end of the Persian period, on the basis of the former versions. The contents of many of its chapters were known neither during Ezra's period nor during that of the com- piler of Chronicles, who lived about fifty years after Ezra. Now during the period of the Second Temple, the priests descended from the house of Zadok claimed the exclusive right of offering sacrifices, and wanted to exclude the other Levites. First they put this idea in the Book as- signed to Ezekiel. The author of Chronicles ascribed the distinction between the Priests and the Levites to king David. Finally toward the end of the Persian period, this distinction was made a Mosaic ordinance. He further states that even the quarrels between the Pharisees and the Sadducees also found expression in some parts of the Priestly Code. The Law of Holiness he finds in Leviticus 18-24, 9, but contends that it</page><page sequence="27">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 433 contains two fundamental conceptions contradicting each other; the one is of a cultural nature, the holines of the priests and the altar, and is of Sadducean origin, and the other of a moral nature, which is of Phari- saic origin, and intended for the people at large. The author goes on to say that the last Editor of the Pentateuch assembled and gathered all these materials together, in a completely objective manner, without favoring any view, including all of them in his compilation. He was well aware of their contradictory character, but his chief purpose was to enrich the historical narrative with large and valuable materials, and to invent for it a chronological order. Owing to this aim he did not succeed well in ordering the materials in many parts of the Pentateuch. But if he had acted differently, he would have been forced to omit many chapters of his Book. We are thus indebted to him for having preserved many valuable parts, of immense import for Israel's history. As to the narratives of the Pentateuch, they were originally of an individual nature, and unconnected with one another. Some of them are legends, expanded in a Midrashic way; others are purely poetical creations, such as the stories of Jacob and Esau, Judah and Tamar, Joseph sold by his brethren, etc. Of some of these poetical narratives, there existed duplicates, as those of Sarah in the house of Pharaoh, and in the house of Abimelech. So also the narrative of the sending of spies, both in the days of Moses and in those of Joshua, and that of dividing the Red Sea and of the Jordan, etc. All these narratives were combined to furnish a historical book, and to invent a background for Israel's early history. In a later time, they added to this historical book the early history from the creation of the world to Abraham, which they took from various sources, and furnished it with a chron- ology. To this latter are due many difficulties in the historical narrative. Concerning the other Books of the Old Testament, the author accepts on the whole the results of modern biblical criticism, with the exception of those on the Books of Ezekiel and Chronicles. Of the former he holds that only the first 37 chapters may be ascribed to the exilic prophet, while chapters 38-39 constitute a later Midrash, and 40-48 present the First Priestly Code written after the building of the Second Temple, and wrongly assigned to Ezekiel. The composition of Chronicles he dates about 350 and, as we have seen, about 50 years before the final redaction of the Pentateuch. Having placed its redaction at the end of the Persian period, he naturally assigns that of the Book of Joshua to a period after the latter or at the beginning of the Mace- donian period. As to the contents of that Book, he does not believe</page><page sequence="28">434 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW that it contains any national tradition of the time of the conquest of Canaan, but asserts that it is a literary fabrication. He does not think that the Israelites at that time were able to preserve any real tradition of that period, since they were in a stage of infancy. The book consists of three volumes, of which the third, dealing with the Wisdom Literature and Apocrypha, besides a number of essays, has not yet been published. The two volumes alone are of im- mense dimensions. If the book had been written in any other language but Hebrew, it would have filled half a dozen volumes. In his Preface, the author states that he worked on the investigations on which the book is founded more than thirty years, and that it is not a book for reading but must be studied from the beginning to the end. If the reader has as much time to spare as the author had for his investigations, he is welcome to study it. Now it is true, his book differs from all other Introductions to the Old Testament, in that it almost everywhere dwells on controversies-the arguments being almost exclusively directed against the orthodox views, as they are more vulnerable, than those of moderate critics-, and it gives the author's own interpretations, accord- ing to his claim, so that it contains an exceedingly large amount of exegesis. It goes without saying that the author's exegetical remarks will be acceptable only to those who share his own point of view. How- ever, we do not think that his views will find niuch favor with modern critics, except with scholars who share FRIEDRICH DELITZSCH'S concep- tions in his pamphlet "Die Grosse Tduschung", and as there are very few of this turn of mind, it is not likely that the author will succeed in rendering modern biblical-criticism more radical than it is at present. Very few will go with the author the length of radicalism in regarding the whole material of the Hexateuch as of no historical character what- ever. Yet who knows whether it would not be preferable for biblical studies if others would imitate his example, so that there would be a clear line of demarcation between them and the believers in biblical tradition. The author is the only one among the modern critics who is thoroughgoing in his line of reasoning, in treating the Penktateuch and the Book of Joshua as pure fiction and a post-exilic creation. For this purpose he is forced to deny the Documentary Theory, as otherwise he would have to concede the pre-exilic origin of the Elohistic and Jah- vistic Documents. The denial of their pre-exilic existence is the funda- mental basis of his critical results. He does not use any religious phrase- ology to apologize for his radical standpoint, as modern scholars do, and his book is absolutely free from any religious sentiment. But as to</page><page sequence="29">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 435 its influence on modern criticism, there are very few non-Jewish scholars who are able to read a book written in modern Hebrew, and it will on the whole remain unknown to them, unless translated into another language. Seeing, however, that most of his views are identical with those of the modern scholars and taken from books well known to them, a re-translation of them would be exceedingly unlikely, unless it is done by one who has time and money to waste. Yet it will not be without influence altogether. There is a radical tendency in modern Hebrew literature, and moderate critical views are very seldom to be found there, while in any other language, various views are to be met with. Therefore the book may have a disastrous effect on the Jewish youth in Eastern Europe to most of whom Hebrew is the only literary medium, and books written in other languages on biblical criticism being inaccessible to them, its study is liable to destroy the last shred of their belief in the religion and traditions of Israel. Bolshevism thrives and feeds upon people of that type. To non-Jewish readers it may seem singular, that a member of "The People of the Book", in the very language of "The Book," should devote more than thirty years of his life to demonstrate the fictitious character of the fundamental part of "the Book", the Pentateuch, the only basis of Judaism. However, there is nothing strange in it. There is a common saying among the Jews, based upon a Midrashic interpretation of Isaiah 49,17: "Thy destroyers and thy wasters will come forth out of thy very midst." We may surely say of this book what Ezekiel, whom the author regards as an epileptic and paralytic (II, p. 384), said of Jerusalem: "Thou hast justified thy sisters" (16, 51). In comparison with this book, all others of a radical tendency are strictly conservative. S. While BERNFELD'S book in its destructive tendencies exceeds all bounds, it is not the only book of a Jewish scholar among the recent biblical literature that is anti-traditional. There is another Introduction to the Old Testament written by a prominent Jewish scholar, whose prominence, however, is not due to his biblical investigations, which constituted merely a side-line of his scholarly activities, but to his studies in Jewish mediaeval philosophy. But it is far from our intention to class them together. Each of these two works is in a class by itself: the former in its radical tendency, and the latter in applying philo- sophical ideas to the elucidation of the origin of Israel's religion and literature. The present work under survey is NEUMARK'S Philosophy of 5The Philosophy of the Bible. By DAVID NEUMARic.

However, though having taken his starting point from modern criticism, the author actually believed that he had presented a con- structive system for the study of the Old Testament. The title of this work may seem striking and singular, as the appli- cation of the science of philosophy to biblical subjects and conceptions is generally designated "theology". Nevertheless, the title is by no means a misnomer. Only students equipped with a philosophic turn of mind would be able to find their way through the mystic lanes of this remarkable work. The reviewer not being a student of that type must freely confess his inability to fully appreciate the philosophical problems, and therefore, it would be a presumption on his part to pronounce any final judgment on their merits or demerits. His judgment must be restricted to those parts that are not beyond his ken. Being a philo- sophical work, it is needless to say that it contains an immense number of ideas not found in biblical studies dealing with Israel's religion and literature, and thus takes a unique position among the recent literary productions in being full of originality. However, originality is of little value, if the basis on which it rests is insecure. The author accepts "the Graf-Wellhausen hypothesis", and without substantiating it, immediately proceeds to erect upon it his philosophical superstructure. Though we could not fully penetrate into the intricacies of his philosophic ideas, being greatly hampered by his terminology and style, to that part that was not too deep for our comprehension we may safely apply the homely saying: What is true is not new, and what is new is not true. As for instance, the author's statement that we find a view in the Talmud, that Moses wrote only the fifth Book of the Torah (Deuteronomy) and some part in the fourth Book, and it leaves the question open as to the writing of the rest of the Torah (p. XVII), might seem to those who do not know the Talmud a startling discovery, but as a matter of fact, it rests upon a misinterpre- tation of a Talmudic passage (Baba Batra 14-15). There is another original statement that the Cherutbim of the Ark of the Covenant were a presentation of the Deity just as the Golden Calves of Jeroboam (p. 65ff.), which has not the least historical basis, and which any person who has some reverence for Israel's religion will regard as little short of blasphemy. It is the author's contention that Old Testament scholars who are unacquainted with the rabbinical and philosophical literature of the</page><page sequence="31">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 437 Jewish Middle Ages cannot penetrate into the spirit of the Jewish way of thinking in the biblical and Greek periods, as Judaism is an entity and must be comprehended as such. He proceeds to say: "Non-Jewish critics often say the Jews are not fit to read the Bible with the right unbiased critical spirit. And may be that they are right to a certain extent. Although it was a Jew, Spinoza, who started modern biblical criticism, it may be that the reverence of the Jew for the Bible was a handicap to his progress in this field, and that he was in need of help from outside. But now, while paying our gratitude for the assistance received, we are entitled and bound to pass the word back. Only a Jew who has imbibed the Jewish spirit in a genuine Jewish education and has devoted his life to the study of Judaism in all its phases, may hope to be able to follow the Jewish spirit in its triumphal course through the ages" (p. XXVII). There may be a grain of truth in the author's challenge to the non-Jewish biblical scholars, but the conceit which such a statement implies is far from being characteristic of a genuine "Jewish spirit". The Rabbis expressed themselves differently in saying that "even a Gentile who studies the Torah is the equal of the High Priest in Israel." The author divides the biblical time into four periods: "The first period concludes with the proclamation of the First Book of the Cove- nant as "Torah"; the second, with the proclamation of Deuteronomy as "Torah"; the third, with the proclamation of the enlarged Priestly Code, together with Deuteronomy as "Torah", and the fourth with the proclamation of our Pentateuch as the Torah" (p. XIIIf.). In his treat- ment of the pre-Sinaitic period, the author contends that in the historical documents we must recognize the historical kernel, even in those sections, where contradictions and evidently legendary traits, especially certain political, religious-cultural and literary-artistic motifs, indicate beyond a doubt that this or that biblical writer deviates, at any rate, objectively, from the historical truth in certain details. From this point of view, it is justified to assume, in accordance with the report of the Torah, that the spiritual development of the A brahamites, the ancestors of a prominent part of ancient Israel, was a continuation of the development in ancient Babylonia, and this is confirmed by a comparison of Babylonian- Assyrian literature with biblical(-talmudical) literature. All reports indicate that the Abrahamites, the Hebrews, went on their wanderings through a spiritual, and probably also through a racial, cross-breeding with other nations, in Egypt and around the Sinai-peninsula, combining afterwards into a loose national unit with the Israelites in Canaan. But</page><page sequence="32">438 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW notwithstanding all these various elements which entered into the development, the Babylonian element remained the chief motive of the reform movement; the more so, as almost all of these foreign elements were Semitic in their origin, dependent on Babylonia-Assyria in all things religious and cultural. A comparison of Babylonian-Assyrian literature with the biblical literature indicates the driving power of the Abrahamitic reform move- ment. In the center of the religious and cultural life of Babylonia was the sexual motif, which prevented the Babylonians from progressing on the road to Monotheism, upon which the author claims they had started in the course of their development, and so long as this motif dominates in the sphere of the Divine, there can be no idea of an in- tellectual, incorporeal divine being. The first step in the progress of the Abrahamites beyond the Babylonians was the realization that the divine Being must be exalted above the sex motif, and this led to the conception of an incorporeal, intellectual Being. Such a Being cannot be presented in a perfect image, which led gradually to the conception of a Being of pure spirit and to the prohibition of making an image of God. This insight into the nature of the Divine revolutionized all forms of life, religious and cultural, and it is safe to assume that this conception of God was first conceived by one great personality, and that in the following generations there were only few who were able to fathom this great idea and utilize it in their lives. The biblical writers were not able to free themselves entirely from the sex motif in their literary productions, and when they could no longer ascribe the sex motif to God, they would not hesitate to ascribe it to the angels. This was the degree of intellectuality of the divine Being attainable for the early period. But by and by the postulates of the prophetic writers went further than this, in excluding also the angels from the sex motif, even though not yet from appearing in human form on earth. The early history of the nation, in which the ancestors were presented as of divine origin, was rewritten by those writers (bards or story tellers). In this new version, God and the angels retained but a providential relation to the family affairs of men, and these relations are of such a nature, that through them the purity of the family of the Abrahamites stands out prominently as against the corruption of other nations. These efforts led to an even more rigid intellectual conception of God. Exaltation above sexuality and corporeality was expressed by the word "holy", which assumed an eminently ethical meaning. Thus the God-conception of the pre-Sinaitic writers was different from the Babylonian conception.</page><page sequence="33">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 439 But in referring to "pre-Sinaitic writers", the author does not mean to state that there existed a pre-Sinaitic literature, since there is no literary production that can be identified as pre-Sinaitic; he merely means to express that this phase of development had already been reached in pre-Sinaitic times. However, the very starting point of the author, the very basis of his conclusions, is rather unsound. Whoever knows the Babylonian religion must see what a shadowy part the feminine deities play in the Baby- lonian religious conceptions. With the exception of Ishtar, who was never married, the goddesses are merely reflexes of the gods. It is a literal and narrow conception to see in the idea of masculine and feminine deities a sex motif, and not active and passive manifestations of the divine essence. The identical conception was held later by the Cabbalists who continually referred to the masculine and feminine principles of the Godhead, yet a sex motif was far from their mind. Thus if the Babylonians had ever attempted to progress to a monotheistic concep- tioii of the Godhead, they could have parted very easily with the sex motif. Nor is there a vestige of truth in the assertion that in the early history of Israel the ancestors were presented as being of divine origin. If at all, we can assume only deification of the ancestors, due to ancestor worship, and the same is of course true of the Babylonians. Surely they did not ascribe to the deified kings Sargon, Naram-Sin, Dungi, Bur-Sin, Hammurabi, divine origin. Why should it have been different in Israel? The author proceeds to deal with the divine names and attributes. But it is almost impossible to present a condensed outline of his specu- lations on this subject, to most of which we must take exception. As for instance, it is only partly true, that nations with a polytheistic system could have no proper conception of justice; the Code of Ham- murabi testifies to the contrary. ft is wrong to maintain that among the Babylonians "injustice, too, had its representatives". All the Babylonian deities, without exception, hostile or friendly toward human beings, even the demons, the eternal enemies of humanity, had on the point of justice to submit to Shamash, the judge of heaven and earth, pronouncing his decisions according to the dictates of Kettu and Meshari, his constant companions, personifications of justice and righteousness. The quarrels among the gods by no means prove his contention, just as little as do dissents among the Justices of the Supreme Court. The quarrels were between gods insisting upon rigid justice and others in- clined to temper justice with mercy. Nor can we find that the Baby- lonian gods themselves were under the sway of Fatum. The author</page><page sequence="34">440 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW mixed the Greeks with the Babylonians, and the Greeks themselves did not know the exact meaning of Fatum, whether it was a decree of Zeus or a force to which he himself was subject. Further, there is not the least evidence that Elohim designates the zealous God of rigid justice. This is merely a homiletic interpretation of the Rabbis, based upon the biblical designation of judges as Elohim. His interpretation of the divine term EHJH as God of absolute mercy, in contrast to Elohim, needs no discussion. The opening chapter, which is the starting point of the author's historical conception of Israel's development, is a mixture of truth and fiction, but the latter abounds to such an extent that truth is almost stifled. To present an outline of the other chapters would require a volume of no small size, and it contains inumerable statements which we could not pass without registering our dissent. The reader interested in the author's views will not get a clear idea from an outline, without reading the book. But I do not think that the author's hope will be realized that his book will be of help to readers, students and teachers of the Bible, owing to the fact that the reader is referred by the author to his previous publications on the subject, in German, English, and Hebrew, for the arguments on which his views are based, the results of a minute study of the literatures concerned, Biblical, Greco-Jewish, and Talmudic. Human life is too short for such a purpose! A book of this kind coming from the pen of a prominent talmudic scholar and philosopher, will serve its end as a book of reference, but will never become popular as a textbook. 6. A real textbook, and as such in a class by itself, is the revised and rewritten edition of the Cambridge Companion of the Bible, under a new title, A Companion to Biblical Studies, edited by BARNES. It is divided into 21 chapters, which cover the whole range of biblical studies both in the Old and New the Testament, and also the Apocrypha. They deal likewise with the post-biblical history of the Jews, with the nations sur- rounding Israel, with cuneiform and Persian literature, and impart information on all the subjects pertaining to biblical studies. Such a work, placing at the disposal of the student the accumulated efforts of 28 scholars of note, cannot but be of importance, and there is no need to dwell on its merits and to give an outline of its contents. As far as the Old Testament is concerned, the results of modern criticism are 6 Companion to Biblical Studies. Edited by W. EMERY BARNES, D.D. Cambridge. THE UNIVERSITY PREss.

The book is well named, and will be indeed a useful and helpful companion to those engaged in biblical studies and in need of informa- tion on certain subjects, who have neither the patience nor the time to hunt for it in the maze of the libraries. Though it is mainly intended for Protestant-Christian ministers, any student ought to avail himself of such a work and have it ready at hand. The views expressed here and there may provoke dissent, but this is of no consideration, and we dare say that these 28 contributors are not in agreement on all subjects treated in this book. The views are almost everywhere suggestive and stimulating. The presentation is concise, clear and methodical. The style is full of charin and dignity, and this book may be regarded as a classic in modern biblical literature. 7. While the preceding work is chiefly intended for Protestant students and deals with the Old and New Testaments, POPE'S book is written from a Catholic point of view and is exclusively restricted to the Old Testament. It is entitled The Catholic Student's "Aids" to the Bible. With the exception of the part that deals with the Catholic conception of Inspiration, which to some students may not seein acceptable, the book will be useful to any student who firmly believes in the historical character of Old Testament traditions, as it contains a large amount of accurate information on all matters connected with biblical studies. Cardinal Archbishop Bourne, who wrote the Preface to the book, points out, that though handbooks written by Protestant scholars have ren- dered untold service to students of the Bible of every degree of religious belief, and among them to many Catholics, they do not in every way meet the needs of Catholic students, as they are perforce silent on the all-important question of the Catholic idea of Inspiration, and the decisions of the Holy See on matters of biblical criticism and interpreta- tion. The need of a Catholic Manual of the same scholarly character, alive to every modern source of elucidation, and fully cognizant of the most recent pronouncements of the Holy See, has long been urgently felt, and this great need has been adequately supplied by the present book. This is a fair and just judgment which we fully endorse. We may only add that it might be useful to non-Catholic students to acquaint themselves with the Catholic point of view on biblical subjects, as among them such knowledge is rather vague. The book is divided into 7Cathoic Student's "Aid" to the Bible. By HUGH POPE, O. P., S.T.M.

We may likewise call attention to the second chapter, which gives full information on the Biblical Versions. 8. Another work written likewise from a Catholic standpoint is ALLGEIER'S Bibel und Schule, with the sub-title, Eine Einleitung ins Alte Testament. It is not exactly an Introduction to the Old Testament, as its contents are concerned with the historical background of the Bible rather than with the Biblical Books and their origin. But it is especially intended for Catholic teachers of religion who are supposed to know the Bible, but lack the method of presenting its contents. It consists of six lectures, the subjects of which are: The modern discoveries in the Near East and their importance for the understanding of the Old Testament; the unparalleled religious-historical position of Israel; the beauty of the Old Testament, its sacred character, and its pedagogical and didactic value. Each lecture is preceded by a bibliography, in which books writ- ten by Protestant and Jewish scholars are also represented. It also contains numerous notes, which show that the author is thoroughly acquainted with modern biblical literature and modern criticism, though he does not accept their hypotheses. Of special interest is the fifth lecture, which discusses and defines the idea of inspiration from a Catholic point of view. The views expressed on this subject are reason- able. As for instance, the statement that if a biblical miracle can be explained in a natural way, there is no need to believe that God inter- fered with laws of nature. As to inspiration, it is limited only to the facts and does not include the language and the style. We must also recognize various degrees of inspiration, according to the individual inspired. Inspiration must not be identified with revelation. Quotations by biblical authors from secular sources need not be regarded as being inspired, as the authors are not responsible for second hand information. The last point is of far-reaching importance, and we are not quite sure whether the author was aware of the deductions from this definition. There can be no doubt that the historical Books, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles contain a good deal of second-hand informiation taken from secular sources, and there would be no need to regard them as being inspired. The book is on the whole a useful contribution to biblical studies. 8Bibel und Schule (Eine Einleitung ins Alte Testament fur Religionslehrer in sechs Vorlesungen). Von ARTHUR ALLGEIER.

We turn again to books written from the standpoint of modern criticism. Among them one of the best, most extensive, and most com- plete Introductions is EISELEN'S Biblical Introduction Series, of which the present work, entitled The Prophetic Books of the Old Testament, covers the second division and appears in two volumes; the first volume deals with the Former Prophets (the Books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings) and the Books of Isaiah and Jeremiah; and the second, with the Books of Ezekiel and the Minor Prophets. As far as his work on the Prophets is concerned, we have no hesitation in pronouncing it excel- lent, as in this subject the Documentary Theory in which the author is a firm believer, plays a subordinate part, and on matters that have no connection whatsoever with the critics' hypotheses concerning the development of Israel's religion, his conclusions show good sense and sound judgment. However, we must emphatically dissent from the rule he lays down for the interpretation of the Prophets, in saying: "Should the Bible student discover that the period to which tradition assigns a given prophetic utterance is historically unsuitable, it becomes his task to find the period of history which offers a more suitable occa- sion for the prophetic message" (II, p. 125). Now let us apply this rule, for instance, to Jeremiah's exhortation of Sabbath observance (17, 19- 27). The author holds with most modern writers that this prophetic utterance is not in the spirit of the seventh-century prophet, and there- fore it must be assigned to the days of Nehemiah (I, p. 278). These scholars see in Sabbath observance a purely ritual institution and com- pletely disregard its ethical import, that it was the only day in which the most wretched of the people, the slaves, could find rest from their oppres- sive labors. Should not Jeremiah, the champion of the poor and op- pressed, be credited with having championed their cause, in proclaiming this observance as one of the most important ethical legislations, which would give to this oppressed portion of Judah 52 days in the year during which they might enjoy a semblance of freedom, and was it not impor- tant enough to make dependent upon its observance the future pros- perity of Judah? Jeremiah himself on another occasion testifies how deeply he felt for the miserable lot of the slaves, when he proclaimed the destruction of Judah, becauise the people brought the slaves back into subjection, after having entered into a covenant with king Zedekiah to free them (34, 8-22). Thus Jeremiah was far from being indifferent to 9The Prophetic Books of the Old Testament. (Their Origin, Contents and Signifi- cance).

We have thus demonstrated that the Sabbath was certainly in the spirit of the seventh-century prophet! Should any Bible student possess the right to tear the prophetic writings to shreds on account of subjective, erroneous misconceptions? It is due to such a vicious and destructive method that biblical commentaries written by modern scholars become more and more useless, as almost every biblical passage is treated from the author's subjective point of view. We may, for in- stance, refer to VOLZ'S commentary on Jeremiah, where the text is emended to such an extent, that Jeremiah himself, if he should rise from his grave, would not recognize his own Book. If we should follow the views of the critics, the pre-exilic Isaiah would have to be placed among the Minor Prophets, as hardly a dozen chapters of his Book would remain on which his authorship is not questioned. While the part dealing with the Prophets is highly valuable, if used with discretion, it is different with that which deals with Historical Books (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings), as it is almost useless for one who does not believe in the Documentary Theory and the dates assigned to each source. But even there the author cannot be accused of being unfair toward the more moderate views in ignoring them, as many others do. On the contrary, he thoroughly discusses all of them, though his own conclusions are severely critical. But it is a matter of regret that such a work splendidly written and presented should be of so little use to conservative students. Yet works of this type are not without value, though anti-traditional, as they are exceedingly suggestive. One has merely to turn their affirmative statements into negative and negative statements into affirmative, and they will be found to express the traditional views. Critics have a harder task than conservative scholars, as they must disprove tradition, and this evidence is, as a rule, of a circumstantial nature and can be easily disproved, while tradition holds its ground as long as it is not convicted by unimpeachable evidence. From such a point of view, the conservative student will find also the author's Introduction of great help in his biblical studies. But it is needless to say that from a critical standpoint, it must be regarded as a highly valuable contribution to biblical literature. Of special interest is the author's investigation of the Chronology given in the Book of Judges, which he compares with that of the found- ing of Solomon's Temple, and demonstrates that according to the former</page><page sequence="39">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 445 580 years had elapsed between the Exodus and the founding of the Temple, and not 480 years. Now this problem will never be solved, if we adhere to the current view which places the Exodus about 1200, as it would necessitate a shortening of the period of the Judges by 200 years, as the author correctly observes. But the problem can find its proper solution, if we date the Exodus about 1350-40, after the death of Amen- ophis IV, when Egypt was in a state of anarchy. The present writer years ago contended that in the old Hebrew records the digits were not expressed by numerals but were indicated by perpendicular strokes, and in an old manuscript tattered and torn, the copyist may have read "four" instead of "three", and from the Exodus to the founding of Solomon's Temple 380 years elapsed (1350-970). Now if we leave out the years of Oppression, which are included in the years of Rest, and further also the years of the Minor Judges, and include among them Jephthah and Samson, we find exactly 380 years. As a matter of fact, a careful investigation of the historical events during the period of the Judges will leave no room for doubt that Jephthah and Samson were contemporaries of Eli and Samuel. The king of the Ammonites against whom Saul fought was the same, who, perhaps a dozen years before, was defeated by Jephthah. With regard to Samson, he lived within the 40 years of Philistine Oppression, that is to say, after Israel's disastrous defeat at Aphek. If so, we can fully reconcile the date of 300 years given by Jephthah with that of the Book of Kings, as from the Exodus to the death of Eli about 300 years elapsed and Jephthah may well have reck- oned from the time when Israel dwelt on the border of Moab. It is of course wrong, as the author thinks, to find any connection between the years of the Minor Judges (70) and those of the Oppression (71). Why should the compilers have done so, as it would not help their scheme of chronology at all? If one is left out, it would give the whole period 510; if both are left out, the date would be 440 from the Exodus to Solomon's Temple. In discussing the name of Samuel, the author ought not to have jumped to the conclusion that the interpretation of this name is wrong it has been done already by Winckler-. He ought to have compared the Old-Babylonian names Sumu-el, Sumu-la-el, and the numerous other names compounded with the element shumu, which is a synonym of maru, aplu, and means, "child, son." It was natural that a child born under such circumstances should be called "Son of God." He was given by God and to God he was dedicated.

An introduction which is likewise based upon the results of modern criticism, and written chiefly for teachers and students, in the hope that they will by its help gain some knowledge of the real value of the Old Testament, and of the meaning of Inspiration, the popular notion of which, that it is mechanical, as the author thinks, has been a cause of great disquietude, is REDLICH'S Introduction to Old Testa- ment Study. The book is divided into nine chapters, the subjects of which are: Hebrew MSS, versions, titles of the Books, and textual criticism; the conception of God and the place of worship; prophecy, sacrifice, priesthood; the poetical Books, the Messianic hope, Canon of the 0. T.; 0. T. science and miracles, and the history of the Hebrews. It contains also a bibliography and a Foreword by Canon RYLE. In his description of the Pentateuch and its composite character, the author follows without discrimination Wellhausen's Prolegomena. He shows more independence in the historical outline of the periods of the Patri- archs and Moses, in utilizing also Priestly narratives. The glory of the Hebrews, he says, is their advance in religious belief, by slow and pain- ful stages, from rudimentary thoughts of deity toward the pure and spiritual conception of God described in the first chapter of Genesis. The Hebrews from the time of Abraham to the eighth century, when pure prophecy emerged, believed in and worshipped one God, but did not deny the existence of other gods. However, the author is quite unaware of the fact that the same belief must have prevailed, froimn a critical standpoint, to the Babylonian captivity, seeing that the Mosaic Books (Gen. 31, 53; Ex. 18, 11; Deut. 4, 19; 10, 17) do not deny the existence of other gods, but merely declare them to be incomparably inferior to the God of Israel, and powerless against Him, as expressed in the Song of Moses (Deut. 32, 31). Jeremiah was the first prophet who denounced the heathen deities as no-gods and vanity, even in their own dominions (2, 11; 16, 20). But his conceptions carried very little weight with his own generation. Nor does the first chapter of Genesis express a purely monotheistic conception, as seen from the words: "And God said: Let us make a man in our image, after our likeness" (Gen. 1, 26). Could a real monotheist have expressed himself in such a way? It is of course against the grain of the critics to admit this point, as otherwise they would have to concede the pre-exilic origin of the first chapter of Genesis. lOAn Introduction to Old Testament Study (for Teachers and Students). By E. BASIL REDLICH, M.A. London: MACMILLAN AND Co., Ltd., 1920. pp. XVII +280.</page><page sequence="41">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 447 The author believes with Delitzsch in the Babylonian origin of the name of Jahveh, saying that Abraham, originally a member of a heathen race, by a divine impulse was driven to seek a new home; he had strug- gled toward a new faith and belief in God, a God known to the Baby- lonians as Jahveh, whose character and attributes were not those of the peoples among whom he dwelt, a God demanding a higher and purer form of religion. However, there is not the least trace of a Jahveh- worship in Babylonia, outside of a few proper names, in which it is doubt- ful whether they are compounded with the name of Jahveh. But con- sidering the lunar character of the ancient Jahveh-worship, traces of which have not entirely disappeared in Israel's religion, we might say, if we insist on the ancient origin of this name, that Jahveh was the deity of Abraham's nomadic tribe, and was one of the many names of the Lunar deity. Abraham on entering Canaan could not but identify his own tribal god with the indigeneous deity of the country, El-Shaddai. But his tribe and his descendants who preferred a nomadic life to that of an agricultural occupation continued to worship their deity under the name of Jahveh. It is a fundamental error on the part of the critics to find a con- tradiction between the message of Moses in the so-called Priestly Code and that in the so-called JE source. The very question of Moses: "Be- hold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them: the God of your ancestors hath sent me unto you; and they shall say unto me: What is His name? what shall I say unto them?" would be inconceivable, if the name of Jahveh had been known to the Israelites in Egypt. There would be nothing new for them in being informed: "Jahveh is His name for ever, and His memorial for all generations." Nor is it likely that the Israelites for centuries should have worshipped a God Jahveh, and that this God of his subjects was quite unknown to the Egyptian king. But the Israelites would certainly have known the name of the God of their ancestors, even if their own worship was not free from idolatrous conceptions. It is thus obviois that both the Jah- vist and Elohist anticipated the statement of the Priestly writer: that God appeared unto the Patriarchs only under the name of El-Shaddai, and their Israelitish descendants continued to worship Him under that name. It is very likely that in Egypt they identified Shaddai with Seti, the god of the Hyksos, so that the name of Jahveh was unknown to them. In the eighth chapter, treating of Old Testament science, the author demonstrates by a number of biblical quotations the naive conceptions</page><page sequence="42">448 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW of the biblical authors on the universe. But if anything is naive in these matters, it is surely the mind of the critics who take poetic expressions literally. The Bible speaks in the language of man and uses prevailing terms and conceptions. They must have used the same terms, even if they had been convinced that they were meaningless. How else could they have made themselves understood to their own generations? Considering the book from a critical point of view, the material is very well presented, in a clear and concise style, and the book will fully serve the purpose for which it is intended. 11. A somewhat similar book in which also the critical theory dominates, and the aim of which is to show the growth of Bible, but which includes also the treatment of the New Testament, is LEWIS' How the Bible Grew. The author believes that the Bible appears to be in conflict with things which are taken for granted in the ordinary affairs of life today, and there is a danger of losing all reverence for this guide- book for Christian living, the foundation of religious life. The difficulty lies in the fact that the history of the Bible is not known, and especially, that the Bible has not been given an opportunity to tell its own story, how it came into existence, and how it came to be the Bible. The Bible should talk for itself. There has been too much enterprise in preparing theories into which to fit the Bible, and far too little endeavor to gather the facts in the Bible which show its growth, and then let the explana- tion come out of the facts. Though accepting many critical views, the author is moderate in his conclusions. He fully believes that Deuteronomy was compiled under the reign of Josiah, but it was done on the basis of the Mosaic legislation, and the compilers had access also to early poetic stories and other traditions. Nor does he deny that at the basis of all the material assembled in the Pentateuch lies the inheritance which the nation had received from Moses, though it is not known how extensive the writings of Moses were, in what form he left them, and how recollections of his thought and service were compiled by others and related to his own writings, as his friends would certainly be disposed to preserve his career and explain its meaning for those who followed. The book is divided into fifteen chapters, which include a chron- ology of the Bible writings and versions and a Bibliography. Especially instructive are the chapters that treat of the various versions of the llHow the Bible Grew. (The Story as told by the Book and its Keepers). By FRANK GRANT LEWIS, Ph. D.

It is written with religious fervor, and will no doubt find favor with religious readers. However, we question the advisability of the author's method in tracing the Bible from the time of Jesus backwards to Sirach, Ezra, Jeremiah, David and Moses, as thereby the same statements have to be repeated again and again, which is rather tedious. Nevertheless it is a useful contribution to biblical studies. 12. With the preceding work that endeavors to gather the facts in the Bible we may join HALL'S Facts About the Bible, which deals also, like the former work, with both the Old and the New Testament. In the Preface, the author informs us that he was a Unitarian minister, but had failed in his ministry, and there is indeed a certain acerbity of temper in his treatment of the subject, as if his views on biblical matters were responsible for his disappointment as a spiritual leader. With regard to the Old Testament, the aim of the author is twofold: first to show the origin of the Pentateuch, that it is a compilation of various con- tradictory sources; and second, that it cannot be due to inspiration, as it contains vicious stories. But while accepting the conclusions of mo- dern critics that the biblical sources were composed centuries after Moses, he is sceptical about the analysis of the Mosaic Books into sepa- rate sources and narratives, as the whole subject is in hopeless confusion. For his own part, he doubts whether its application to the Book of Genesis can appear satisfactory.-On this point the author shows bet- ter judgment than many modern scholars. To his mind, the only Book in the Pentateuch which has been satisfactorily accounted for is the Book of Deuteronomy. Though the work contains not a few superficial remarks, on the whole the subject is not badly treated, and the con- clusions are rather moderate. Concerning the treatment of the New Testament, its aim is to show that the divinity of Jesus was not a part of the early Christian creed. The author remarks: "Those who make history of the legends regard- ing the miraculous birth of Jesus must be held responsible for the fanciful and fortunately unprovable theory that Jesus was an illegitimate child. There is sanity and wisdom in the Unitarian doctrine that the origin of Jesus was as natural and as pure as that of George Washington." He pleads that the Gospels should be treated as we treat the Old Testament, making due allowance for the stories of the marvellous and the produc- tions of Oriental imagination.

The Preface of the books contains also a letter written to a theologian years ago, in which the author suggested that the resurrection of Jesus might be accounted for on the hypothesis that he had not died upon the cross, but swooned, and this hypothesis he based upon several passages in the Gospels. 13. The survey of the Introductions which, with the exception of those of Catholic authors, are more or less imbued with Wellhausen's ideas, may be appropriately concluded with KEGEL'S watchword: Los von Wellhausen. The author designates his investigation: A Contribu- tion to a New Orientation in Old Testament Science. He holds Wellhausen directly responsible for the well-known vicious attack on the Old Testament by FRIEDRICH DELITSCH in his pamphlet, Die Grosse Tauschung. But before entering upon this subject, the reviewer considers it his duty to say a few words in defence of his teacher. The post-war Delitzsch must not be identified with the broad-minded schol- ar of that name whom he knew about twenty-five years ago, who in his classes always treated the Old Testament with high reverence, notwith- standing his contention that Israel was indebted to Babylonia for many religious conceptions. But he was at the same time a most ardent Ger- man patriot, and nothing in the world was more dear to his heart than the German Empire. The first thing on entering his house one could see was the well-known motto: We Germans fear None but God. The downfall of the German Empire, contrary to this motto, completely turned his mind, and like many other scholars he held the Jewish Socialists, directly responsible for the overthrow of the Monarchy. His attack on the Old Testament was directed more at his Jewish contemporaries than at ancient Israel. We may compare him to Elisha son of Abuyah, who lost his faith in Israel's religion, and was designated A4er. But his disciple Rabbi Meir still honored him even after his apostasy and continued to be his disciple. Delitszch in his attack on the Old Testament became the Frank- enstein of Wellhausen's School, and the terror of his species, since he maintained that he was carrying out Wellhausen's method to its logical conclusions. Thereupon a large number of German critics ro3e against him, and denied that Wellhausen can be made responsible for his views. 13Los von Wellhausen. By MARTIN KEGEL. Gutersloh: Druck und Verlag von C. BERTELSMANN, 1923. pp. 70.</page><page sequence="45">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE HOSCHANDER 451 Against these scholars the author turns in his study, and proves that the views pronounced by Delitzsch are the same as can be found in Well- hausen's Prolegomena. If, however, in spite of the Prolegomena, the Old Testament continued to be held in high esteem by almost all theologians, it was indeed illogical. Wellhausen was the precursor of Delitzsch, and if the scholars do not like his company, their watchword must be: "Away from Wellhausen!" Now Wellhausen's dependence upon Vatke is generally known, since he acknowledged to have learnt from Vatke "the most and the best." It is further a generally recognized fact that Vatke's construc- tion of Old Testament history and religion was founded on Hegel's philosophy. Delitzsch, however, is the spiritual offspring of Wellhausen. The author expresses these facts wittily in biblical parlance, in saying: "Hegel begat Vatke; Vatke begat Wellhausen; Wellhausen begat Del- itzsch; Delitzsch, however, became the grave-digger of the method of Wellhausen's treatment of Israel's history, inaugurated by Hegel." The author proceeds to demonstrate point for point Wellhausen's dependence upon Hegel's philosophy, and shows his method of harmonizing the biblical sources with his philosophical views. Nevertheless, he devotes a special chapter to the recognition of Wellhausen's services to biblical studies. In the last chapter he gives the reason why his methods and ideas are obsolete and ought to be abandoned. It is sufficient to call attention to this highly interesting study. Bible students ought to read it carefully, and if they do so, they might adopt his watch-word: "Los von Wellhausen!" 14. For students to whom the only basis of biblical exegesis and history is the Documentary Theory no book among the recent Old Test- ament studies ought to be of more importance than EISSFELDT'S Hexateuch-Synopse. It contains, as stated on the title-page, the narra- tive of the Five Books of Moses and the Book of Joshua, with the begin- ning of the Book of Judges, dissected into their four Sources, and pre- sented in German translation, with verification furnished in the Intro- duction and in the notes. We may add to this statement, that Leviticus, not being a biblical narrative, is omitted, and so are all the priestly parts of Exodus and Numbers, as far as they do not contain narrative mate- rial. Of Deuteronomy only chapters 31-34 are given, with the exclusion '4Hexateuch-Synopse.

The reason for its omission is the impossibility of assigning it to any of the four sources. The Book of the Covenant is likewise omitted, as the author does not regard it as having been a part of the Sinaitic legislation. The book consists of four parts: the Introduction (pp. 1-88), the Synoptic Survey of the Hexateuch (pp. 89-108), the Proper Synopsis (pp. 1*-253*), and the Notes (pp. 254*-285*). The main thesis of the author is to demonstrate that the Hexateuch is composed of four Sources. In accordance with this thesis, the translation is arranged in four parallel columns, and in a way that each of these Sources might be read sepa- rately, and at the sam'e time a mere glance might show their combina- tion. All kinds of additions, harmoni.zing notes of the Redactors, and expansions are printed in Italics. The author's division of Sources is on the whole not a fundamental departure from the current Documentary-Hypothesis. It is more of a technical nature or of a matter of convenience than an innovation. While Wellhausen completed the edifice of criticism in asserting that the Pentateuch or more correctly the Hexateuch, outside of Deuter- onomy, was composed of three sources J. E. and P., and this theory was generally accepted even by scholars of a more conservative tendency, critics soon went further, in proving that these three Sources by origin had not been literary units either, and a further division was necessary. Thus these three Sources were divided again into J', J2, E', E2, E3, pi, p2, P3. A different position, which is at present out of favor with the critical school, had been taken by SMEND, who recognized only four Sources, JI, J2, E. and P. While this critic sees in J two main independent sources, he does not concede the same to E and P. With regard to E, he denies that this original source was subsequently altered or sup- plemented. The parts of this source that seem to be additions, he as- signs to J, especially to J', and the rest of it he holds to constitute a literary unit. As to P, a small part of it he assigns to the older sources, and a large part that looks as a different source, he ascribes to a later period, when P had already been combined with the other sources. Now the author accepts Smend's four-sources division, but in- stead of dividing J into two main independent sources, he sees in J1 a Layman-Source, and accordingly the Hexateuch is to be divided into L, J, E, P. In L he sees the older source; though to some extent being influenced by the prophetic-priestly spirit, it was less exposed to this influence than the other sources. He believes that the symbols J1, J2 are misleading, as it might be thought that an original source J has been</page><page sequence="47">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 453 expanded and supplemented by Redactors, and some scholars actually hold such a view. As to the dates assigned to these four sources, their relative age is indicated in the order L, J, E, P so that L is the oldest and P the young- est, but the author is not definite on this point. He thinks that L, might perhaps be assigned to the days of Elijah, J to the first half of the eighth century, E to the times of Amos and Isaiah, and P to about 500 B. C. E. Nor is he definite on the current critical opinion that J was of Judean origin and E of that of Ephraim, and regards the evidence on which this opinion is based somewhat precarious. It goes without saying that the author holds that each of the four sources originally contained a complete narrative. Yet in the Fall of Man, for instance, J curses Adam without rhyme or reason, and the author admits that J did not know the version of L, extant in the Pent- ateuch, and believes with Meinhold that in this version Adam's trans- gression consisted in the negligent conduct of his office as warden and gardener of Eden. No comment is necessary. However, it requires the peculiarly constituted mind of a critic to find in the words: "Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee . . . in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread," that according to L, Adam was cursed to lead a nomadic life, while in the parallel version of J the curse consisted in condemning him to till the ground. The so-called Redactors must have been of a pedantic turn of mind iti presenting a narrative accord- ing to one version and inserting from the other a word or a sentence that is of no import whatsoever. As for instance, in the narrative of the three angels who came to visit Abraham, the L version reads: "make ready quickly three measures of meal," and the term "fine meal" was inserted into it from J. So also in the narrative of Sodom presented according to L, into the passage: "The men of the city compassed the house round, both young and old," was inserted the J version: "the men of Sodom, all the people from every quarter." There are almost innumerable in- stances of the same sort. Does it not look as if the critics judge the Redactors from their own pedantic point of view? Yet we have not the least quarrel with the author and we believe that he has produced a splendid work which will be of immense import to biblical criticism. Thus far the critics were satisfied to present a Table of Sources and they could easily pretend that each of them presented a complete narrative. As to the so-called JE sources, it has been fre- quently admitted by many scholars that their dissection into separate Documents is well nigh impossible, especially in large parts of Exodus</page><page sequence="48">454 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW and Numbers. In this book, however, we come face to face with these so-called separate narratives, and the preposterous character of such a critical systenm must be apparent to any unbiased student. His Synopsis is a splendid exposition of the critical fallacy. The reviewer especially enjoyed the analysis of the Balaam narrative. He found that Balaam went to bed as a Jahvist, slept soundly as an Elohist, received Balak's ambassadors in the morning as a Jahvist, and in the same frame of mind went to bed again, but in his sleep he turned into an Elohist, and so he remained on his journey and on his arrival at Moab, while his ass re- mained a good orthodox Jahvist, and a Jahvistical angel became his adversary, evidently on account of his apostasy. And if the author had not emended the text in Numb. 23, 3, in reading Elohimn instead of Jah- veh, we would still more wonder that as an Elohist Balaam expected to meet Jahveh, but instead of it he is accosted by Elohim. A careful read- ing of his Synopsis would show many other phenomena of this sort. But we must repeat again that this reductio ad absurdum is not directed at the author but at the critical system of which he is a faithful and exact exponent. On the contrary, one must be deeply impressed with the dig- nified manner of his exposition, the modesty and the moderation with which his views are expressed. It is our firm belief that the author has involuntarily advanced biblical studies in the direction of truth. Hence this work should be urgently recommended to any Bible student to see plainly what the Documentary-Hypothesis looks like. In reading this book we are reminded of the Eleatic system of philosophy. The effect of the paradoxes of Zeno of Elea was to complete the discomfiture of philosophy, notwithstanding the fact that he sought to recommend his master Parmenides's doctrine. The same may be true of the author, who is a pupil of Wellhausen. His work may have the same effect, as his dis- section of the sources clearly demonstrates the erroneous character of his master's doctrines. 15. Having gone on an excursion into the dizzy heights of the Hex- ateuch-Synopse, it is restful for mind and body to feel firm ground in turning to a work in which there is nothing hypothetical, and the only aim of which is to give sound and lucid exegesis. This is GoULD'S Commentary on the Books of Ezra-Nehemiah and Esther. The biblical text of both the Authorized and Revised Versions is presented in par- allel columns. We are badly in need of commentaries of this kind, which UEzra-Nehemiah and Esther. By Pres. GEORGE P. GOULD, D.D. An American Commentary on the Old Testament.

Students will feel greatly indebted to the author for this work. The interpretation on a philological, historical and archaeological basis is excellent. Both the Commentaries on Ezra- Nehemiah and Esther are prefaced by brief introductions, treating of their place in the 0. T. Canon, title, contents, sources, authorship. Though conservative, the author is fair enough to refer also to critical interpretations. Here and there, when textual difficulties are insur- mountable, the text is emended. There is hardly anything that we miss, as far as we can see, or to which we may take exception. The fact that we do not find any reference to the question, whether Ezra brought with him the whole Pentateuch or merely the Priestly Code, seems to indicate that the author belongs to the small band of scholars who do not accept the Documentary Theory. This is far from being a defect. Commentaries of this type will endure when biblical criticism will have passed into history and will have found its eternal rest with other sys- tems of the past. 16. With this book, in which the historicity of biblical tradition is not questioned, we mnay join another work in which the tradition is valiantly defended. If there is an Old Testament Book of more impor- tance for the New Testament and the rise and formation of Christianity than all the others, it is surely the Book of Daniel. Hence it is natural that conservative Christian scholars should resent any attack on its genuine character, as such an attack would indirectly strike at the Christian creed, in the development of which this Book had so large a share. Though these attacks are of long standing, and in modern text- books on biblical exegesis and history have actually become a truism, defenders of this Book's historicity were by no means wanting, as for instance, Keil's and Wright's commentaries on Daniel. But we may doubt whether any of its former champions were so well equipped with all modern weapons, consisting of a thorough knowledge of Semitic and classic languages and Oriental history, as the well-known Princeton scholar, who seems to have made the defence of this Book his life-work. WILSON'S Studies in the Book of Daniel, is divided into eighteen chap- '6Studies in the Book of Daniel. A Discussion of the Historical Questions. By ROBERT DICK WILSON, Ph.D., D.D. New York: G. P. PUTNAM'S SONS, 1917. pp. XVI +402.</page><page sequence="50">456 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW ters, and is, as the author states, the first of three volumes, concerned especially with the objections made to the historical statements con- tained in the Book of Daniel, treating incidentally of chronological, geographical, and philosophical questions. In a second volume, the author intends to discuss the objections made against the Book on phil- ological assumptions, based on the nature of the Hebrew and Aramaic, in which it is written. In a third volume, his intention is to discuss Daniel's relation to the Canon of the Old Testament, determining the date of the Book, and in connection with it the silence of Ecclesiasticus with reference to Daniel, the alleged absence of an observable influence of Daniel upon post-exilic literature, and the whole matter of apocalyp- tic literature, especially in its relation to predictive prophecy. The method pursued by the author is to give first of all a discussion of some of the principles involved in the objections; then to state the objections with the assumptions on which they are based; next, to give the reasons why these assumptions are adjudged to be false; and lastly, to sum up the conclusions derived from the discussions. Every objection is con- fronted with documentary evidence. When no evidence is procurable either pro or con he shows by analogy that the events or statements recorded in Daniel are possible, and that the objections cannot be proved by mere assertion, unsupported by testimony. The author hopes that this volume may confirm the faith of any wavering ones in the historicity of the Book which was so highly prized and so often quoted by Jesus and his Apostles, and that it may show, particularly to men who have a due regard for the laws of evidence, how flimsy are the grounds on which some would reject the testimony and impugn the veracity of the writer of Daniel. With this hope he sends his book forth upon its mission in the world. He is convinced that the methods pursued by many so-called higher critics are illogical, irrational, and unscientific. They are illogical, because they beg the question at issue; irrational, for assuming that historical facts are self-evident, and that they can set limits to the possible; and unscientific, because they base their conclusions on incomplete inductions and on a practical claim of omniscience. No outline of the author's refutations of the objections raised against the historical character of the Book of Daniel can be furnished; it must be left to the reader to acquaint himself with his arguments. His defence of the biblical Book will surely confirm the faith of the "wavering ones." But those to whom the author addressed himself do no "waver", but are firmly convinced of the pseudepigraphical character</page><page sequence="51">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 457 of Daniel. However, it must be borne in mind that these historical mat- ters, which are questioned and which the author defends in this volume and the forthcoming publications, are merely a side-issue in the attitude of the critics toward this Book and serve merely as a confirmation of its late origin. The main objection is based upon its singular character in regard to miracles and prophecy. There is nothing in all the Old Tes- tament Books in which the supernatural plays such a part, exceeding all bounds of human imagination. While almost all of the other biblical miracles and prophecies admit more or less of a rational explanation, such a rationalistic interpretation cannot be applied to those of Daniel. This is the real crux of the problems involved. All the arguments in the world will not be able to change the attitude of the modern rationalistic scholars. Yet this is purely a subjective conception of the Divine Omnipotence. One who says in biblical parlance: "Is the Lord's hand waxed short?" will accept also these miracles and prophecies as a matter of fact and will see nothing strange in them. However, though this book will not succeed in establishing the historical character of the Book of Daniel among modern scholars, it will affect its historical exegesis to a considerable extent, and is therefore a valuable contribution to biblical studies. 17. A book of a more recent date and also of a highly scientific na- ture which pursues the same aim, to prove the historicity of the Book of Daniel, but of a wider scope, since it treats also of the matters which Wilson intends to consider in his next two volumes, is BOUTE- FLOWER S In and Around the Book of Daniel. In the Introduction, the author gives a clear-cut exposition of the two different views held respecting this Book. According to the orthodox view, the Book is a narrative of surprising events that happened in the life of a saintly Jewish captive, holding a very high position at the courts of Babylon and Persia, a fragmentary biography of one who was a special favorite of heaven, including visions such as have been granted to no other man. The estimate of this book formed by the critics is far different. To them it appears as one of the Pseudepigrapha, or Jewish religious books, writ- ten under a false name, or rather an assumed name, which appeared in the second and first centuries B. C. E. They would probably confess it to be the most remarkable of these books, the noblest and the loftiest in its teaching, the grandest in its scope no less than in its descriptions, 171n and Around the Book of Daniel.

New York and Toronto: The MACMILLAN PRESS, 1923. pp. XVIII +314.</page><page sequence="52">458 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW a literary work of superlative merit; but at the same time a human com- position. They look upon it as a religious novel, resting upon a shadowy background of history, written about 164 B. C. E., in the troublous days of the Maccabees, with the noble intention of encouraging the faithful in a time of persecution and of supporting them under severe trials. Though seeing much in this Book that meets with their approval and being fully awake to its literary beauties, in the eyes of the critics, it is a mere work of imagination, cleverly put together, but containing not a few historical inaccuracies, owing to its having been written several centuries after the time which it describes. To them, therefore, its great facts are pure fancies; its mighty miracles, mere feats of the imagination, its so-called prophecies, past history clothed with the garb of prophecy -a favorite practice in the apocalypses of the Pseudepigrapha. If this view of the matter be the correct one, the puzzle is, how did this Book come to be included in the Canon, and how came it to be treated by the Founder of Christianity with special honor? Though the author deals with all matters bearing on the problem at issue, his main interest centres in the visions and prophecies, to which ten of the twenty-five chapters are devoted. He especially contends that the two views held respecting the historical character of this Book may be styled the Roman and the Grecian, according to the scheme of inter- pretation adopted with regard to the Four Kingdoms. If the Book was written 164 B. C. E., it follows that the Four Kingdoms cannot be Bab- ylon, Persia, Greece and Rome, seeing that in the year 164, Rome, though on her way to greatness, had not yet developed into a world power. Thus according to the critical view the Four Kingdoms must be Babylon, Media, Persia and Greece. The author illustrates his con- tention by two tables showing the Roman and Grecian schemes. How- ever, on that point the author is certainly wrong. No matter which scheme the critics adopt, nothing ought to prevent them from adopting the Roman view. Surely, Rome in the year 164 was a greater world power than were Babylonia, Media or Persia, in their palmiest days. Many years before 164, Rome was practically the arbiter of the destinies of all the nations that belonged to the empire of Alexander the Great, except the Parthian Kingdom, and even possessed many countries which never were subject to Alexander. A writer who lived about 164 would have regarded Rome as the most formidable empire, since he never knew of another more powerful. The defeat of Antiochus the Great and of Carthlage by Rome, its. subjection of Greece and Macedonia, were enough to have it regarded among all the civilized peoples as the greatest</page><page sequence="53">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 459 world power. From our own angle of vision, Rome had not yet attained its full power, but not from that of a writer who lived about 164. All the kings of that period trembled at the mere sight of a Roman Legate. Thus these interpretations are not interdependent with those regarding the historicity of Daniel. If scholars should think so, their historical perception is at fault. Highly interesting is his discussion of the identity of Darius the Mede, which is one of the most difficult problems in the Book of Daniel. He identifies him with Cambyses son of Cyrus. Now it is true, Darius is said to have been sixty-two years old at his accession. But the author believes that the numbers had been written alphabetically, and 62 was expressed by the letters Samrekh-Beth; seeing that during the fifth cen- tury there was a remarkable resemblance between the letters Samekh and Yod, the original number was Yod-Beth = 12, and thus the age of Darius is reduced from 62 to 12, which would be a very likely age for Cambyses at the time of the taking of Babylon, supposing him to be the son of the daughter of Astyages and born about a year after the capture of Ecbatana. This identification is more likely than that of WILSON, who contends that this Darius was Gobryas, who was made governor of Babylon. But if we should accept the author's identifica- tion, we would have to go a step further and assume that he was called "a Mede," because originally he was intended to succeed his grand- father Astyages as King of Media, that it was not Cyrus' intention to overthrow the Median supremacy, and their complete subjection dates from the time of Darius Hystaspes, when the Medes revolted. Such a supposition would seem very likely, as it finds support in the Book of Ezra (6, 2), where it is stated that the royal archives were at Ecbatana. This leaves scarcely any room for doubt that Ecbatana continued to be the capital of the Kingdom, thus Cyrus resided in the midst of the Medians and not among his own people. If he was nevertheless called King of Persia, he may have conducted the government of the Medes in the name of his infant son, the legitimate successor of Astyages. How- ever, there is one difficulty which cannot be easily solved, as the author himself seems to feel; the statement that the relatively small kingdom of Babylon was divided into 120 satrapies. Nevertheless a young boy that wanted to play the part of a grand monarch might have done such a thing. We must further assume that these 120 satraps were Babylon- ian natives and not Persian grandees, as otherwise he could not have condemned them to death with their families, if we accept the historical character of the narrative of Daniel in the den of lions.</page><page sequence="54">460 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW The book is certainly worth reading, as it is excellently written and contains a wealth of real information on matters of archaeology, history, philology, and classic literature. It would be a highly valuable contri- bution to biblical literature and history, even if we should absolutely de- cline to accept his views on the Book of Daniel. Its title, In and Around the Book of Daniel, is well chosen. If the reader should refuse to get "in," he can pick information enough, in accompanying the author "around" the Book of Daniel. The book is prefaced by the famous Assyriologist PINCHES, and we cannot part with it, without taking issue with this scholar. In pointing out difficulties we meet with in the Old Testament, he observes: "After this comes the question of the bat- tle of the four kings against five in Genesis 14, for now we have the complete list of the year-dates of Hammurabi, the king who is appar- ently identified with Amraphel, and among them there is no record of an expedition to the Dead Sea region or any of the lands adjacent there- to." Does this scholar not know that according to this narrative Am- raphel was a vassal of the king of Elam, and if he was forced to march against his own people the Amorites, he must have felt it as a deep dis- grace? Does he expect Hammurabi to record his own disgrace in a Date-List? Do we find in a Date-List of the First Babylonian Dynasty the year in which Sin-muballit was defeated by Kudur-mabug? And there can not be the least doubt that he was defeated by the latter. Or does Pinches know a cuneiform date in which a king recorded his own defeat? As a inatter of fact, Ungnad several years ago published an in- scription of Hammurabi dating from the 23rd year of his reign, referring to the building of the wall of Sippar, in which he calls himself simply "king of Babylon," and neither claims to be "king of the four quarters of the world," nor "king of Shumer and Akkad," and we may rest as- sured that it was not done on account of modesty. At that time his rival Rim-Sin the son of Kudur-mabug was still powerful, and he did not dare to assume a title that belonged to the latter. There can be no doubt that on his accession he was the vassal of the king of Elam, whatever the name of this Elamitic king may have been. It is certainly peculiar and almost incredible that a scholar of his prominence should make such a statement. 18. That Babylonia exerted a deep influence on the civilization of the Westland, which can be explained only if they had been for a con- siderable period politically united, can be seen from JIRKU'S Altorien- '8Altorientalischer Kommentar zum Alten Testamentt. By Dr. ANTON JIRKU. Leip- zig, Erlangen: A. DEICHERTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG. 1923. pp. XIV+254.</page><page sequence="55">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 461 talischer Kommentar zum Alten Testament. The archaeological materials offered in this book cover the whole field of Old Testament study from Genesis to Chronicles. Of such a work, it may truly be said that it fills a gap in biblical studies. For there are very few books that present archaeological materials for study, without projecting into them sub- jective conclusions, by which the judgment of the student is prejudiced, and there is none in which all the results of explorations and excavations, in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Asia Minor, and Palestine, have been gathered into one volume. However, in surveying these materials, we cannot but reflect upon the fact, that Israel came upon the scene of history, when the flourish- ing periods of the ancient civilizations of Babylonia and Egypt belonged to the past, and were already somewhat decayed. If we should believe in human progress and at the same time in the influence of environment, we ought to see the same progress in Israel's development and assume that it was largely due to external influence, and expect this youngest member of the group of ancient nations to possess ethical conceptions superior to those of its aged contemporaries. This would be in accord- dance with modern ideas of evolution, with history, and with biblical traditions. This would be the great lesson of archaeology-if the critics should keep their hands off-. Unfortunately, in the present state of biblical studies, archaeology is of importance only when it tends to con- firm the view of the critics. Thus for instance, let us admit that the first chapter of Genesis depends upon the Babylonian story of creation-a view that is generally held. But the composition of the latter must be assigned to the Ham- murabi-period, about 2000 B. C. E., and thus about 700 years before Moses. Should not 700 years be a sufficiently long time for transform- ing the Babylonian story into the biblical account under the influence of Israel's henotheistic religion? The same is true of the Code of Ham- murabi in comparing it with the Book of the Covenant, and it is no less true of the Priestly ordinances. However, it is only fair to say that the modern critics do not treat archaeology worse than they treat the Old Testament. If any statement of either does not fit into their scheme, it is explained away. As for instance, it is very easy to maintain that since the Babylonian story of creation was found in the Library of Ashurbanipal, Israel did not become acquainted with it before they had coine into close contact with Assyria. The ancient connection of Abra- ham with Ur of the Chaldees is denied, as this statement belongs to P. The reference to Ur-Kasdim by J and E (Gen. 11, 28; 15, 7), is treated</page><page sequence="56">462 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW as a later gloss of the Redactors. Some deny even the rule of Hammurabi over the Westland. The influence of the Code of Hammurabi on the Book of the Covenant is also denied, and in the latter is seen an inde- pendent development, though even a layman could recognize their close connection. Thus archaeology is for modern critics of value only if it confirms them in views at which they had arrived independently. On second thought, however, it is incorrect to say that archaeology is of no importance for them. They make the best use of it, in demonstrat- ing thereby that the Old Testament stories are merely worked over Babylonian legends and therefore of not the least ethical value. Thus JIRKU'S book is indeed a Thesaurus. But what is the use of riches if they do not serve a real purpose, instead of undermining the foundations of religion? The author, in pointing out the lesson of archaeology, observes that the biblical prehistory with its Babylonian parallels, the biblical Psalms and their Egyptian counterparts, reminds us that Israel, in spite of its thoughts and feelings, ought not to be higher esteemed than an ancient Oriental people among other Oriental peoples, being bone of their bones and flesh of their flesh. This undoubted fact is made only more impressive by the present work. But notwithstanding its close connection with its environment, in one matter that transcends all others Israel went its own way: in its belief in God, which is commonly called Ethical Monotheism, and of such a belief no trace is to be found in the ancient Orient. This incontestable truth must be emphasized in such a work. Thus JIRKU's view is different from that of NEUMARK (5), that the Babylonians were progressing in the direction of Monotheism. It is noteworthy that among the parallels to the divine name Jahveh, the old Babylonian proper names compounded with Jaum, Ja-vi-um, etc., upon which Delitzsch based his contention that Jahveh was an old Babylonian deity, are ignored altogether, though the author rightly maintains that a God Jahveh was worshipped also outside Israel. But he emphatically denies that this God was in any way identical with the God of Israel. He further contends that in the designation Elohint we must not see any trace of a polytheistic conception. In the Amarna Letters we find that the king of Egypt was addressed by Palestinian princes as ilania "my gods," and in a treaty between the Hittite king Shubbiluliuma and the king of Mitanni Mattiuaza, found in Boghazkbi, each of the gods Mitra, Uruwana, and Nashatya, invoked as witnesses, are written with the divine determinative ilani. He differs with Ed. Meyer in his recent work Ursprung und Anfdnge des Christentums, II,</page><page sequence="57">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 463 p. 22f., who holds that the designation Elohim was due to a long de- velopment during which it was doubtful whether they should use the plural or the singular as a divine designation of Israel's God. Of specific interest, that has an important bearing on the origin of Israel, are the parallels to the name 'Ibrim. The name .Habiri occurs for the first time in a Babylonian text of the famous king Rin-Sin of Larsa in South Babylonia, whose name may well have been pronounced Riw-Aku, and in the tradition of the Westland may have been mixed up with his elder brother Arad-Sin pronounced Eri-Aku. He died in the life-time of his father Kudur-mabug, and on account of similarity of the two names, outsiders may not have known of the change of rulers, and therefore in Genesis 14, the name of the king of Ellasar(=Larsa) is writtenArioch(Eri-Aku). The text in which the name IHabiru is men- tioned is a receipt and reads: "Four garments for the officers of the people of the lIabiri, which Ibni-Adad has received." Considering that Ur of the Chaldees was situated in South Babylonia and was a part of the kingdom of Rim-Sin, Abraham may well have been a subject of this king, if not of his brother, and as a West Semite may have been forced to leave this territory on account of political reasons. Thus this inscription testifies to the presence of IHabiri in South Babylonia. If we find in Babylonia under the Cassite Dynasty people designated as .Ha-bir-a-a, they are remnants of the former who may have been very numerous in an earlier period but had migrated toward the West. The name is found again in a number of Amarna Letters, especially in the letters of Arad-I.epa prince of Jerusalem, who informs the Egyptian overlord about a people named .Habiri coming from the desert and set- tling in the country. While in these letters their name is written IHa-bir-ri, kHa-bir-ru, in other letters it is written ideographically SA- GAz people. The identity of SA-GAZ with .Habiri is proved by lists of gods written in cuneiform, found in Boghazk6i. In the annals of the Hittite king Murshilis II, there is a reference to a man belonging to the SA-GAZ people, and thus people of that race seem to have dwelt also within the Hittite territory. Now it must be borne in mind that Harran was situated in the kingdom of Mitanni which in the 14th century became a part of the Hittite empire, and where else should we expect to find 'Ibrim, if not at the home of Abraham's nearest relatives? A god IHa-bi-ru is mentioned also in a list of gods, found at Asshur. This is no surprise either. The deification of the ancestor of the 'Ibrim is to be expected. The place of his worship may well have been Harran, and he may have belonged to the pantheon of the Lunar god Bel-Harran.</page><page sequence="58">464 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW When Mitanni including Harran was taken by Assyria, this god became a inember of the Assyrian pantheon. Formerly when Harran belonged to the Hittite-Mitanni, this god was enumerated among the Hittite deities. The term ilani Hjabiri in the Hittite lists of gods does not mean "the gods H.abiri," as ilani, as we have seen, corresponds to Hebrew Elohim, construed as a singular. Nor can it be proved from the expres- sion ilani sha Habiri "the gods of the Ilabiri," that .Habiru was not the name of the god, since here as elsewhere the names of the god and of the people were identical, their name being derived from this deified Hero Eponyms. JIRKU'S own conclusions from these materials are somewhat different, which partly confirm and partly deny biblical traditions. Of further interest are the parallels to biblical textual criticism and literary criticism in the Appendices (pp. 248-25 1). His views may have an important bearing on the development of biblical criticism. He observes: "A main problem of the Old Testament literary criticism, especially in the Pentateuch, is the well-known phenomenon, that an externally homogeneous record is in reality composed of several tradi- tions. This is an incontestable fact, which cannot be satisfactorily explained. We can prove the diverse threads of the web, but not the manner in which this web was produced. No contention whatever of Wellhausen's school, repeated over and over again with all zeal, can deceive us into the belief that the last word on Pentateuchal criticism has been said concerning this question. Now we find exactly the same phenomenon in the Babylonian Gilgamish Epic; thtre are often on the same tablet statements which are contradictory, and which cannot be reconciled, and yet this Epic claims to have come from one and the same mould." Thus about 700 years before Moses, a Babylonian author wrote in the same way as Moses is supposed to have done in the Penta- teuch. If the ancient Babylonian author used contradictory sources, may not Moses have done the same? When the last word in Penta- teuchal criticism is spoken, a good many books on this subject will be consigned to oblivion and will be regarded in the libraries as literary curiosities. 19. That there is a tendency to investigate anew critical dogmas of the Wellhausen's school, and not accept them as infallible, is seen also from SCHAEFFER'S Hebrew Tribal Economy and the Jubilee (as illus- trated in Semitic and Indo-European Village Communities), the thesis 19Hebrew Tribal Economy and the Jubilee (as illustrated in Indo-European Village Communities).

STECHERT &amp; CO. pp. VIII +198.</page><page sequence="59">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-IIOSCHANDER 465 of which is directed against this school, which regards the law of the Jubilee as the product of a post-exilic school of priestly writers. The book is a supplementary volume to the eleventh chapter of his work, Social Legislation of the Primitive Semites (1915). The opinion expressed there regarding the origin of the institution of the Jubilee has now been re-inforced by an array of facts tending to show that the economic features of this institution are part and parcel of Israel's inheritance. Though the author is non-committal on the origin of the Priestly Code, yet if we may judge from his arguments in accepting statements occur- ring only in the so-called Priestly Code as absolutely historical, the law of the Jubilee is not the only point of disagreement between him and the current critical school. For instance, we find that he refers to Kor4h's rebellion, which the critics look upon as a post-exilic fable, and to other parts of P, as Gen. 17:18, 1-4. As a matter of fact, we gain the impression that all the P narratives of Numbers are accepted by him as historical facts from which he draws safe conclusions concerning the tribal organization of ancient Israel. If we do not deceive ourselves, we gladly welcome the author as a member of the small band of conservative scholars, who are not inclined to look upon the priestly authors as writers of fiction, and he certainly deserves credit for having the cour- age of his conviction to challenge current opinions. On the other hand, the scholars to whom he addressed himself will reject his evidence, as being based upon P which they do not accept as history. However, his thesis is not based upon the Old Testament but upon analogies, and since the latter cannot be denied, the former must be accepted as well, if there is any reliance upon historical analogy. The aim of the work is to show by an abundance of evidence, that in the early literature of Israel, the feeling of religious, political, moral, and economic solidarity was the dominant factor of the ancient Hebrews. In the period of tribalism, the tribe and its individuals have a solidarity, in religion, in politics, in moral and social economy. This feeling, orig- inating in the family group, was gradually extended to the clan, to the tribe, and finally to the nation. Tribal modes of thought concern them- selves with the family group, the clanship, and the tribal group rather than with the individual as such. How can it be otherwise in a state of society where the individual can hardly exist without the protection and help of his group? With the transition from the tribal state to the settled agricultural life of the village community, the organization of the tribe may have to undergo some necessary modifications and changes, but the inherited customs of the past remain essentially the same.</page><page sequence="60">466 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW If the author's investigations led him to deviate from the current critical conception of the biblical traditions of the Pentateuch, it is quite logical. Individual responsibility is surely not the fundamental basis of the Mosaic legislation in the Pentateuch, as the author abund- antly proves. This was a later conception. The individual is of course punished for his own transgressions. But the tribe is responsible for the morale, both ethical and religious, of its individual members, and must suffer as a whole, if it fails to punish them for their misdeeds. The very fact that the basis of all biblical laws is tribal responsibility leaves no room for doubt that they date from an early period, and are not due to legal enactment during the exilic or post-exilic periods. Nevertheless, the author might still hold that in the present literary form they are post-exilic. But such a form does not impugn their early origin, just as little as a translation of the Bible from the Hebrew changes its con- tents, if the translator is faithful in the rendering of the Hebrew text. We have said that the main evidence on which the author based his conclusions is analogy. He shows by a comparative study of Semitic and Indo-European village communities, that similar regulations and customs are met with elsewhere. Nine of the sixteen chapters into which the book is divided, deal with the Babylonian village, community, the tribal villages of India, Homeric land tenure, Roman ager publicus, Rus- sian village communities, the German system, the tribal systems of Ireland and Wales, and the old English township. The author has cer- tainly produced a book worth reading that cannot but leave a lasting imprint on biblical studies. 20. From this highly scientific work that gives us an insight into the early conditions of Israel, we turn to a book that goes much further in leading us into the pre-Adamitic period, "when following upon the Fall of the Angels, this earth, in its embryonic state, had become the battle- ground where the War between Yahveh, the Son of the Almighty Father, and Satan was to be fought out" (p. 14), and the aim of which is to find a method of reconciliation between Christianity and Science, LowN- DES' Historical Truth of the Book of Genesis. The author rightly thinks that what seems to be wanted is not so much a demonstration that to deny the historical and scientific truth of the Book of Genesis is to un- dermine Christianity and to deprive the world of its only possible rel- igion, as to show how it is rational to take the Bible narrative of the 20The Historical Truth of the Book of Genesis.

Volume I. pp. VII +314.</page><page sequence="61">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 467 origin of our earth and of man's part in it for sober history. A critic, if he is listened to, must be prepared to offer some more reasonable account of things than that with which he quarrels. His attempt to satisfy this demand is to show that the true interpretation of the earlier narrative of Genesis is diametrically opposed to the almost immemorial popular interpretation of it; and that since modern critics concern themselves only with the popular tradition, the true tradition of the inspired writers remains unaffected by their theories or conclusions. The author reminds the reader that 33 years ago, Lux Mundi was published, practically the first attempt in England to find the path which would lead to an agreement of Christianity and Science, and this agree- ment was avowedly sought by the method of restating the Faith in the terms of Modern Science. These years, the full space of a generation, have given time enough to test the results. This method had been car- ried out to its logical conclusions in the hand of extremists. As a method of reconciliation it has completely failed, for the theories of Science have triumphed, and traditional Christianity is fast being stamped out. But there is another way which may possibly yield better results; and that is to restate Modern Science in the Terms of the Catholic Faith. In that way both the facts established by Science and the truth of the Christian creed may be preserved: We accept the facts, but we take our interpretation of these facts, not from the scientists, but from the Bible. As for instance, the author accepts the verdict of Science that the traces of human life upon earth go back to so remote an age that most autho- rities would measure man's existence upon earth by perhaps hundreds of thousands of years. Adam, however, cannot be placed earlier than seven thousand years ago. But Adam was not the physical father of all mankind but the spiritual father. Adam was, in fact, the first man to live as a man and not as a beast. The author goes on, in the part entitled Origin of Civilization, to show that the Sumerians were instructed in civilization by the Semite Adam. The book is divided into three parts, which are subdivided into chapters. The first part treats of the Problem and its Solution, the Prob- lem of the Pentateuch, the Documentary Theory, and the Contrast of the first two chapters of Genesis; the second, of Interpretation of Holy Scripture, Principles of Interpretation, Method of Holy Scripture; and the third part deals with Origin of Civilization, Religion and Civiliza- tion, the History of Government, Agriculture, Art, and Astronomy. The author shows a good knowledge of modern science, biblical criticism and archaeology. His book will no doubt appeal to pious Catholics, and per-</page><page sequence="62">468 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW haps less to the general reader, though the reviewer enjoyed it. If we read only books that are written from our own point of view, we do not enlarge our knowledge, and the book is remarkably well written. 21. While the biblical interpretation of LOWNDES presupposes the belief in doctrines which are not generally accepted, and is of not the least use for those who do not believe in them, it is different with REID'S Astronomy of the Bible, which is of high value for anybody that believes in the Bible, though the author addressed himself in the first place to Christian readers. It is written in defence of Biblical Truth, in contend- ing that the Astronomy of the Bible is far in advance of the time in which it was written. The author thinks that to disbelieve in God, a man must believe in a thousand anomalies which he cannot reconcile with reason; and he must accept contradictions and improbabilities without number. He must assume that effects are greater than causes; that the greatest effects are without any cause at all; that something, and a mighty some- thing at that, came from nothing. There is no controversy between true science and the Bible. Both are manifestations of divine truth. This book is not primarily a study of the Bible, but a study of astronomy. Yet throughout, the author says, we seek the aid of the sublime words of Holy Writ, and we find a better understanding of the Bible through the light that science gives. The author illustrates his thesis by discussing the power of gravita- tion, the transfer of energy, the impress of light, etc. He observes that the pseudo-scientist repeats his formula, "bodies are attracted toward one another by the force of gravity; and the force of gravity is that which draws them together." He ends where he began, and he begins where he ended; he is reasoning in a circle. How do light and the force of gravitation travel across the abyss of space? Or in the words of God to Job: "By what way is light distributed?" Scientists cannot tell. The theory that light travels by vibrations in the light-bearing ether does not explain it. The theory, in its very constitution, is self-destructive. By this theory, one thing is supposed to act upon another through a space absolutely empty. In treating of the center of the universe, the author remarks, that, while men clung to the idea that the earth was the center of all things, the Book of Job knew better than that, in say- ing: "Lo, these are but the outskirts of His way; and how small a whisper do we hear of Him!" If the earth is on the outskirts, it certainly cannot 2lAstronomy and the Bible. (The Empire of Creation seen in the dual Light of Science and the Word). By LUCAS A. REED, M.S.

And as the garnished heavens that we see are also "but the outskirts" of God's works, and as these are but a "faint whisper" of the word that spoke them into existence, then the distance to that center must be immense, wherever that center may be. The book is divided into twenty-four chapters and is profusely il- lustrated with astronomical charts. The reviewer is not a "scientist" of that type, and confesses that he knows very little about these mat- ters. Thus the fact that he was deeply impressed with the author's arguments is no proof that it will have the same effect on readers thor- oughly versed in these matters. But the general reader, being not much better off than the reviewer, will certainly not remain indifferent to the author's arguments, will wonder whether there is any possibility of re- futing them, and will find his book highly instructive. It is a book that surely deserves recommendation to modern students, as it might set them thinking, whether science can dispense with the belief in a Per- sonal God. However, the book would be still more effective, if it had not been, in parts at least, overloaded with religious phraseology. In such matters, it is best to let the facts speak for themselves. Religious phraseology tends to prejudice the modern reader in suspecting that the scientific facts have been doctored in the interest of religion. But this is by no means the case. Almost all the scientific definitions are literal quotations from Huxley and many other scientists. (To be continued) JACOB HOSCHANDER. Jewish Theological Seminary of America.</page></plain_text>
