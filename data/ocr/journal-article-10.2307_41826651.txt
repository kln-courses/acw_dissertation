<plain_text><page sequence="1">Notes THE EARLIEST ENGRAVING? This note is meant to call attention to an important contribution to the literature on early printmaking that has largely gone unnoticed, espe- cially in anglophone scholarship (for example D. Landau and P. Pârshall, The Renaissance Print , 1994). Peter Schmidt, in Die Grosse Schlacht: Ein Historienbild aus der Frühzeit des Kupferstichs (Wiesbaden 1992), provides an exhaustive analy- sis of the large engraving known as the Grosse Schlacht , or Great Battie (Lehrs I, p. 286,6), which survives in only one impression now in the Rothschild collection at the Louvre (fig. 39). Although the engraving had been carefully studied before, most notably by Lilli Fischel, Schmidt's investigation extends well beyond this. He provides persuasive evidence that this may well be the earliest surviving engraving for which we can convincingly establish a date. Schmidt builds his case around the identification of the battle itself as an important episode in the suppression of the Hussite heresy. On the basis of heraldry - supported by compelling circum- stantial, sartorial and material evidence - he identifies the subject as Herzog Johann von der Pfalz overcoming the Hussite forces at Hiltersried in 1433. Assuming this is cor- rect, it confirms previous speculation that the engraving commemorates a specific event and was therefore almost certainly a commission. And because the purpose of such a proclamation would have paled after the Hussite problem was largely resolved in 1436-37, a date for the print imme- diately after the battle seems very probable. Hence, Schmidt's study provides a well-documented argument for a date prior to that usually given for the prints of the Master of the Playing Cards, generally placed in the mid- to late 1 430s on unstable termini based on copies in manuscripts. There are several aspects to this case that are surprising in light of received wisdom about the beginning stages of engraving as a pictorial medium. Not only is the print exceptionally ambitious in scale, there is good reason to sup- pose it is reproductive, in other words, made after a painting 39.

The importance of a reproduc- tive motive for early engraving was strongly argued by Fischel and extensively by Fritz Koreny in his dissertation of 1968, but has since lost favour. There are many formal and structural indications of Italian influence. Lasdy, affinities of motif, style and technique to be found in contemporary painting as well as in the works of important eponymous engravers, suggest a workshop in the region of Regensburg, that is to say, well wide of the Upper Rhine region where the 'genesis' of engraving has traditionally been located. PETER PARSHALL A ROMAN FRESCO, GIULIO ROMANO AND TWO PRINTS. On the authorship of the fresco frieze with Stories of Scipio Afiicanus in the Sala del Trono in the Conservatori Palace in Rome, which bears the date 1544 in roman num- bers, there is still no agreement among art historians. On the various attributions, from Daniele da Volterra to Marco Pino and Roviale Spagnolo, see The Fresco Decoration of the Pauline Rooms in the Palazzo dei Conservatori (Ann Arbor, MI Í993, pp. 65-68) and P. Leone de Castris, Pittura del Cinquecento a Napoli, 1 340-1 573: Fasto e devozione (Naples 1996, p. 189, n. 13). Until now only Andrea Zezza, in Marco Pino. L'opera completa (Naples 2003, p. 83, n. 12) has pointed out a generic relation between these frescoes and Giulio Romano's inventions. In fact, the scene with the Capture of Carthage (fig. 40) shows the same composition as the tapestry representing this episode that was part of the famous set woven for the French monarch, Francis I, between 1531 and 1534 after Giulio Romano's inventions. Relevant to this tapestry are two drawings at the Louvre, one of which can be identified with the definitive model made by Gianfrancesco Penni (see Jules Romain: L'Histoire de Scipion , edited by R. Bacou and B. Jestaz, Paris 1978, pp. 17-19); a third one that was formerly on the New York auction mar- ket (E. Gaudioso, 'I lavori farnesiani a Castel Sant'Angelo: Precisazioni ed ipotesi', in Bollettino d'arte , lxi, 1976, p. 33); a print carried out under the direction of Romano himself around 1521-22; and another dated and signed Georg Pencz ¡539 (figs. 41-42; see S. Massari, Giulio Romano pinxit ed delin- eavit, Rome 1993, pp. 46, 50-52). The author of the Roman fresco did not servilely copy one of the prints, but changed many details. For example, he represented the Roman fleet on the right, dispersed with the warriors in the lower right corner and moved to the left the man in the foreground carrying the ladder. Pencz's print had recently been published and was very popular. It is known today in seven states (see D. Landau, Catalogo completo dell'- opera grafica di Georg Pencz , Milan 1978, pp. 41-43). The other one belonged to a set of three prints related to Romano's tapestries, the other two being Hannibal and Scipio Meeting Each Other Before the Battle of £ama and Scipio 's Victory over Hannibal (see Massari, op. cit., pp. 42-46). These two episodes were represented in the Roman frieze too, but in a completely different way. Clearly it is impossible to determine if the author of the frescoes was acquainted with Pencz's print or with the other one, because they are almost identical. STEFANO PIERGUIDI 40.

Research on Peter Perez Burdett for the exhibition 'Joseph Wright of Derby in Liverpool' to be shown at the Walker in 2007 recently led me to look in The Derby Mercury in the 1760s for advertisements placed by him for his map of Derbyshire. An unexpected by-product was the discovery of an advertisement published in this newspaper on 19 August, 1769, p. 1, which reads: This day is published Price 15s and sold by Samuel Fox, Bookseller, in Derby. A Metzotinto portrait of a Philosopher shewing an Experiment on the Air Pump 'Painted by Mr Joseph Wright of Derby' NB.

Wright's painting An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump , which is dated 1768, had been exhibited twice at the Society of Artists in that year, first as no. 193 in the annual exhibi- tion, and later in September as no. 131 in a special exhibition in honour of the King of Denmark. The critic of the Gazetteer , 23 May 1768, had greatly admired the work. An impression of Green's mezzotint (fig. 43) was also shown at the Society of Artists in May 1769 as no. 271. Green himself published it, but John Boydell very quickly acquired the plate and published it again in June 1769. Both Green and Boydell maintained a price of 15s. William Pether's mezzotint after Wright's A Philosopher giv- ing a Lecture on the Orrery had also been published by Boydell, in May 1768. Pether exhibited an impression at the Society of Artists in the same month as no. 271. Its price of 15s in Boydell's 1773 stock catalogue was the same as in the adver- tisement in The Derby Mercury, which does not mention Boydell's name. The painting, of course, was at Staunton Harold, just a few miles from Derby, in the house of Earl Ferrers, who had purchased it in 1766, the year of its exhibi- tion at the Society of Artists as no. 195. The mezzotint of the Corsican patriot, General Pascal Paoli (1725-1807), was not based on a portrait by Wright. It is uncertain which of the engravings of him was available from Fox. The most likely candidates include the print pub- lished by Carrington Bowles on 1 May 1769 after a painting of 1768 by the Philadelphia artist Henry Benbridge (i743-i8i2), commissioned by James Boswell, which was exhibited at the Free Society of Artists in 1769. This portrait is now in the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco. Robert G. Stewart, in Henry Benbridge, 1743-1812: American Portrait Painter (Washington, DC 1971, pp. 45, 47 no. 41), has suggested that this mezzotint was done under the supervision of Sir Robert Strange. Benbridge's portrait has also been discussed by Francis Beretti ('The first portraits of Pascal Paoli . . .', The British Art Journal, in, 2, 2001, pp. 69-71). A second possibili- ty is that the print was the mezzotint by Richard Houston after Pietro Gherardi that was published by Matthew Darly on 4 June 1769. In addition, two undated mezzotints were made by Richard Brookshaw after Gambalini and another by Richard Purcell (fl . 1732-66) after Constantinus. Two smaller mezzotints, one of which was probably the one dated 8 May 1769 that was made by John Raphael Smith, were published by Robert Sayer. Ellen G. D'Oench (f Copper into Gold Prints by John Raphael Smith 1731-1812, New Haven and London 1999, pp. 5-7) discusses several of the prints after portraits of General Paoli, who visited England in 1769. Samuel Fox was the publisher on 15 October 1760 of An Improv'd Map of the County of Derby , which he dedicated to the Right Hon. Nathaniel Lord Scarsdale of Kedleston Hall. As in the 1769 advertisement, he gave no address other than Derby. Fox also stated that 'he had all sorts of books &amp; sta- tionary [sic] ware, stamps on parchment, &amp;c. paper, paper hangings for rooms, globes, musical instruments &amp; c.', but made no mention of prints. , MARTIN HOPKINSON HEINRICH THEODOR WEHLE. A notable number of German draughtsmen, especially landscape artists, are not usually front runners when it comes to discussing land- scape drawing or painting in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century. Many of them have been forgotten or are only considered in a regional context. This unsatisfacto- ry level of research is changing. Several of these artists have been researched in more depth in the past few years. This has led to many new insights and a better understanding of their work, their rôle within the artistic milieu during this transitional period in Germany and their relationship to col- lectors, other artists and even to publishers. Especially when they had become well known, publishers and printmakers tried to persuade these artists to produce drawings, which a professional engraver or etcher would then turn into a print. A fine example of this is Heinrich Theodor Wehle (1778-1805), an artist best known for his emotional land- scapes of great skill. Although he died young, Wehle established a remarkable reputation as an outstanding draughtsman and landscape artist. Beside working as a draughtsman for professional printmakers, producing up to 34 prints, he himself made four etchings. This was by no means a provincial situation. Wehle was a pupii first of Christoph Nathe in Goerlitz, then of Giovanni Battista Casanova, a historical painter who left no trace in Wehle 's œuvre , then, more importantly, of Adrian Zingg and Johann Christoph Klengel. These two artists define a frame- work for Wehle 's landscape drawings. Although he remained deeply rooted within his cultural background in Dresden, Wehle established his own concept of landscape. A recent exhibition in Bautzen, Dessau and Goerlitz aimed to show Wehle 's contribution to landscape drawing and espe- cially to landscape printmaking in his time. It was accompa- nied by the catalogue Im Rach der schönen, wilden Natur: der Landschaftszeichner Hdnrich Theodor Wehle, 1778-1805 (Bautzen, Sorbisches Museum, 4 September-13 November 2005, Dessau, Anhaltische Gemäldegalerie, 27 November 2005-22 January 2006, Goerlitz, Kulturhistorisches Museum, 3 February-2 April 2006, Bautzen, Domowina- Verlag, 2005, 231 pp., fully illustrated, €24.90). The catalogue relies for its biographical information and attributions mostly on the excellent and tireless research undertaken by Anke Fröhlich in recent years. In various publications she has examined the wide range of landscape imagery especially in Dresden in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Although her essay is mostly ded- icated to Wehle as draughtsman, she is able to link these drawings and their rôle to prints made either by (fig. 44) or after (fig. 45) him. This not only provides a background for the other essays, but places Wehle within his own time and cultural situation. He is a typical example of a draughts- man who also engaged in printmaking in late eighteenth- century Germany, as well as an exception on account of his PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, I</page><page sequence="6">NOTES 47 44.

Wehle dramatically changed his style during this period on some of his sheets, yet he retained a more Western European approach for his home market. It is interesting to note how he reacted as a draughtsman to the needs of an increasingly specialist art market, often working closely with professional printmakers who then turned his inventions into marketable editions. Although he did draughting work for the Chalcographische Gesellschaft as a commercial enterprise, the idea was to make his designs and his understanding of landscape or nature available to a wide audience. Some of the essays in the catalogue discuss this culturally interesting phenomenon at the end of the eighteenth century. Three in particular contribute new aspects to the biographical knowl- edge of Wehle 's life and drawings, to his relation to contem- porary theory and to the perception of him after his early death. Fröhlich not only summarizes her own research, but groups the various kinds of drawings together. This is espe- cially helpful because of the later aquatints after his designs, and this approach provides a key to understanding the appearance of these prints. Norbert Michels 's essay covers the relation between contemporary poetry and landscape theory, especially the publications by Christian Cay Lorenz Hirschfeld (1742-95) accompanying Wehle 's drawings, and the subsequent prints. He brings out the formal new ele- ments in these drawings and in many of the prints, and links them to the contemporary theory of landscape depiction and to garden theory, as well as contextualizing Wehle 's drawings within his own era. Many of these new points, either formal or in regard to content, lead to a new under- standing of nature, as becomes more evident with the PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, I</page><page sequence="8">NOTES 49 German Romantics. Many of the features they display made their first appearance in Wehle's drawings and prints and created an important, but not the only basis for his later emotionally charged landscapes. This is not yet the case by the end of the eighteenth century, but it constitutes an important starting point. It is Michels's great achievement to have placed Wehle's drawings, prints and the prints after his drawings into a complex intellectual situation, making clear the various links that are inherent in these works. A third remarkable essay is by Maria Mirtschin on the perception of Wehle in his own time. She carefully examines various sources to establish when, after his death, Wehle was seen in a particular way and what kind of information appeared about him. It was a long time before Wehle's biographical details were set in the right light and it is extremely useful to have these various accounts of his life. The most notable among the other essays is one by Ruben Rebmann on some drawings in Verona that had been attrib- uted to Wehle. Rebmann argues distinctively that they are not by the artist, partly because of the chronology of the city's urban development. Other contributions are on the views of St Petersburg in Wehle's time, the experience of the film-maker Alfred Krautz during a trip following Wehle in the 1970s, and a more ethnographical approach to drawing as a borderline experience. They add little to understanding Wehle as an artist. Nor does an article by Kai Wenzel on the prints after Wehle. He uses a rather old methodological framework, defining prints after drawings as mere repro- ductions. He therefore misses the point of why these draw- ings were engraved, why they failed in the art market and what new approaches they may have taken to nature or landscape. In this respect the essay by Michels offers much more new material and stimulating ideas. The end of the book contains an excellent catalogue raisonné of the drawings, the prints after Wehle and the few by himself. Although its illustrations are often rather small, this volume is an extremely valuable starting point for further research into the field of landscape prints in late eighteenth-century Germany. CHRISTIAN RÜMELIN CARRIÈRE. The very high reputation held by Eugène Carrière at the beginning of the last century led to the pub- lication of several major studies of his work by leading con- temporary critics, including Elie Faure, Gustave Geffroy, Charles Morice and Gabriel Séailles. However, following the advent of Cubism, his art became increasingly difficult for modernist authors to include in the canon. For over 50 years Carrière's paintings were much neglected, except by a very few isolated authors. The late 1960s saw the beginning of a new interest in his œuvre, as art historians widened their exploration of Symbolism. However, his prints, although exhibited and reproduced, remained largely undiscussed. This has changed with a series of exhibitions marking the centenary of Carrière's death, the most ambitious of which was shown at the Kunsthalle Bremen and the Clemens-Sels- Museum, Neuss. The accompanying catalogue edited by Anne Röver-Kann, Intimität der Gefiihle: Euglène Carrière zum 100 Todestag (Bremen and Neuss, 2006, 184 pp., 86 col. and 145 b. &amp; w. ills., €24), included contributions from Eduard Beauchamp, Werner Busch, Gisela Gotte, Werner Hofmann and Anna Schultz, as well as from the editor, whose essay on Carrière and the new lithography is the most important discussion of the artist's printmaking to date. Museums and collectors in Germanic countries were among the first to appreciate Carrière's work. He exhibited at the Munich Secession in 1896, and in the following year his prints were included in the second exhibition of the Vienna Secession and at the Kunstgewerbemuseum in Berlin. Josef Engelhart, organizer of the 1899 exhibition of the Vienna Secession, wrote appreciatively of his drawings and lithographs. That year Julius Meier-Graefe published his Maternité (Grande Planche) in Germinal. Among the German enthusiasts for Carrière's prints was Dr Hans Heinrich Meier Junior. His collection forms the heart of the Kunsthalle Bremen's holdings of the artist's work. Röver- Kann enumerates the print rooms in Germany, Austria, Sweden and Hungary that own Carrière's lithographs. Pride of place is Dresden, with almost 40 prints. Berlin, Stockholm and Budapest also own important groups. The holdings of Vienna, Copenhagen and two museums in Hamburg are noted, as are those of the British Museum and New York Public Library. Röver-Kann records the curators who were responsible for acquisitions, all famous connoisseurs of prints. It is no surprise to find that Campbell Dodgson col- lected Carrière. Recorded here, too, are the dealers from whom prints were acquired. Foremost in Germany was Ludwig Gutbier of Dresden's Galerie Ernst Arnold. In Berlin, the prime supplier of French prints was Sachse, Eduard Schulte, Keller &amp; Reimer. A key publication was an article by Léonce Bénédite written for Gustav Glück, 'Die französische Lithographie der Gegenwart und ihre Meister', published in Die Graphischen Künste in 1898. French dealers and publishers also thoroughly appreciated Carrière's prints. The 1890s saw a proliferation of publications of port- folios of lithographs. Röver-Kann notes that Carrière's work was commissioned by André Marty, Maurice Dumont, Vollard and others for albums dating between 1893 and i899- Röver-Kann's most important contribution is her discus- sion of the Frenchman's lithographic technique. Carrière worked from dark to light as if he was making mezzotints. Indeed, some of his most extraordinary lithographs, includ- ing Songerie and Le Sommeil of 1896-97, could be easily mis- taken in reproduction for mezzotints. The careful choice of oriental papers enhanced this effect. Unlike many of his con- temporaries, such as Redon and Fantin-Latour, with whose work his prints have often been compared, he did not work with chalk on smooth stones. One early lithograph, Les Morts d'Amour , a music cover, appears to be an exception and is very reminiscent of Fantin's Wagnerian lithographs. Carrière used tusche on stones that had been roughly etched. To create the lights he employed scrapers, steel brushes, sandpaper, needles and fabric to rub and scratch away the surface. For his famous series of portraits, known as 'the Pantheon', he boiled up an asphalt mixture to use as a tusche. Vitally important to the artist was the assistance of a master PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, I</page><page sequence="9">50 NOTES printer, Eduard Duchâtel of Lemercier. Even so, there were manifold difficulties in printing, as can be seen occasionally in bare patches, corrosive stains and where the tusche mixture ran. Often Carrière used a combination of a grey and a black stone. Some lithographs were printed in brownish black or dark brown. On one occasion, in the poster for the 1900 Rodin exhibition, four different tones can be discerned. In a number of cases differently inked and printed impres- sions of the same print were presented in the Bremen show. Röver-Kann notes that the manière noire style of lithogra- phy, first outlined by Senefelder, was never very popular with printmakers, and goes on to record some of the exceptions, beginning with Delacroix's Macbeth and the Witches of the mid- 1 820s. She notes the Parisian printer Charles Motte's encouragement of Louis Boulanger and Charlet to experi- ment with it. Carrière must have seen the 1892 retrospective of Charlet's prints. Also noted here is MenzeFs use of a brush and scraper in six lithographs of 1851. Contemporary with Carrière were the ventures of Toulouse-Lautrec. Röver- Kann compares his 1892 Le Pendu poster for Les Dromes de Toulouse with Carrière 's magnificent Le fondeur of 1900. Other comparisons are made with Rodin's rare lithograph, L'Eternelle Idole , and with Munch's 1896 Nude mezzotint, which was printed at Lemercier by Duchâtel. Röver-Kann notes that Kollwitz was already making chiaroscuro litho- graphs in 1893, before she saw Carrière 's prints on exhibi- tion in Berlin in 1898. A short uncredited essay, presumably by Röver-Kann, introduces C arrière 's posters of 1897-1900 and explains the political setting of the one he made for the newspaper L'Aurore , Littéraire -Artistique - Sociale , which was published at the height of the Dreyfus affair. Three of the posters were made for the 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle, two of them for the Pavillon des Mines and the Pavillon de la Métallurgie. Both of these evoke the art of the politically committed Belgian sculptor and printmaker, Constantin Meunier. The Bremen catalogue also includes 100 opinions on Carrière expressed by critics, art historians and fellow artists, from Maurice Denis in 1885 to Edwin Becker and Rodolphe Rapetti in 2005. The artists include Degas, Whistler, Redon, Emile Bernard, Rodin and Per Kirkeby, and the poets and novelists, Edmond de Goncourt, Verhaeren, Mirabeau, Zola, Rodenbach, Rilke and Anatole France. Also in the exhibition was a wide range of prints from early chiaroscuro woodcuts to the lithographs of Redon, Munch and Kollwitz, which set Carrière's preoccupation with light and dark into context. Three-and-a-half centuries' history of printmakers' use of chiaroscuro in etching, mez- zotint, aquatint and monotype, as well as in woodcut and lithography, is outlined in an essay by Werner Busch. A com- parison between the art of Carrière and Röntgen photogra- phy was included in the catalogue to the 1996 Musée des Beaux-Arts, Strasbourg, exhibition' 'Eugène Carrière 1849-1906', while Rainer Michael Mason in the 1983 Geneva exhibition catalogue, Eugène Carrière - Anders estampes , described the artist's lithograph of Rodin as close to the vision of Robert Demachy and Edward Steichen. The latter expressed his admiration for the Frenchman in The Photogram , as is mentioned by Anna Schultz, who discusses Carrière's relationship with pictorialist photography. The artist's likely use of a photograph of Henri de Rochefort as part of his working process towards his oil and lithographic portraits of this subject is noted. Schultz reminds us that the use of photography by lithographic printers goes as far back as 1849 at least, when the printer Joseph Lemercier fixed a photograph on a lithographic stone. Decatur, a small university town in Illinois, has hosted the first American exhibition of Carrière's work since the show organized by Allentown Art Museum in 1968. All the paint- ings, pastels, drawings and prints on display were drawn from the collection of Dr Nick Vlachos. The exhibition was accompanied by a book, Eugène Carrière: Shadow and Substance (Decatur, IL, Decatur Area Arts Council and Millikin University, 2006, 88 pp., 64 col. and 11 b. w. ills., $45), writ- ten by Shelley Cordulack, the text of which was published both in English and French. Cordulack associates Carrière's work with contemporary ideas in the new science of psycho- physiology. In France, the principal exponents were Claude Bernard, the painter and etcher, Théodule Ribot, and the philosopher, historian and aesthetician Hippolyte Taine. Cordulack refers to Carrière's 1888 etching, Réalités ayant la magie du rêve , published that year by the artist's close friend Jean Dolent, in his book Amoureux d'Art. The title may have been assigned by Dolent. Carrière attended the monthly dinners, Les Têtes de Bois, with the poet Jean Moréas and other Symbolist writers. His famous series of lithographic portraits included Verlaine and Daudet as well as Dolenti Cordulack also places Carrière's portraiture in the context of the philosopher Henri Bergson's concept of la durée. Also introduced is the contemporary interest in spiritual- ism. The artist's ghostlike female figures are discussed in relation to late nineteenth-century views of the effect of the moon on women. Roger-Marx's comments on Carrière's reconciliation of the individual and the milieu is explained by reference to Claude Bernard's physiological theory of milieu intérieur. Elie Faure, it is noted, quoted the naturalist Frédéric Houssay, who used Carrière as an example of artists' understanding of the continuity between human bodies and the surrounding air. Le Sommeil , his lithograph of his sleeping son, Jean-René, is placed in the context of deca- dent fascination with the sensual and enveloping qualities of human hair. As others have done, Cordulak sees parallels in the contemporary work of Munch. Carrière's own words about maternity are seen as reminiscent of the theory of the naturalist Ernst Haeckel. The artist's wife suffered from a nervous malaise of a sort that some contemporary scientific ideas explained as uterine hysteria. It is hard, however, to think that an artist, who in his lithographs showed himself such a poet of tenderness to mothers and young children, shared in the more extreme views of the day as to women's inferiority. Two early writers on Carrière spoke of his inter- est in transformism, an idea of unity linking the organic and inorganic and body and spirit. Séailles even mentions draw- ings which are now lost that illustrated these ideas.

Of the 'Glasgow Four', J. Herbert McNair has received precious little scholarly attention com- pared with the work of his brother-in-law Mackintosh and the Macdonald sisters. Roger Billcliffe's pioneering study in the Walker Art Gallery Liverpool Annual Report and Bulletin of 1 970-7 1 has at last been followed up by an exhibition at the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, devoted to McNair and his wife Frances Macdonald. The show travels to the Walker, Liverpool in 2007. It is accompanied by the book Doves and Dreams: The Art of Frances Macdonald and J. Herbert McNair (Aldershot, Lund Humphries, 2006, 192 pp., 116 col. and 50 b. &amp; w. ills., £40), edited by Pamela Robertson. Macdonald has been more fortunate than her husband in attracting study by Jude Burkhauser and Janice Heiland. The summary catalogue of all the known works of the couple provided by Robertson at the end of this volume includes their prints. Essays are contributed by Robertson, Janice Heiland, Annette Carruthers and the partnership of Juliet Kinchin and Joseph Sharpies. Frances Macdonald's known prints were all made between 1893 and 1899. These include the archetypical 'Spook school' Drooko poster of c. 1894-95, designed with her sister Margaret for a Glasgow umbrella manufacturer. This striking image is known today only through an illustration in Dekorative Kunst. The two sisters combined on other poster designs, most famously with McNair on the 1896 poster for the Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts, which attracted notice in both France and Italy. Frances's sole etching was a bookplate of c. 1898, the only known impression of which is in the Museum of Applied Arts in Budapest. For a second bookplate she employed lithography While still a student, she also designed a line-block to advertise a programme of music at Glasgow School of Art in 1893. Although signed by Frances alone, the lettering in this design is identical with that of a line-block invitation card for a Glasgow School of Art 'At Home' of the same year signed by her sister Margaret. The composition and style of the latter is very close to a pencil design for a bookplate by Frances, which is signed and dated 1893. It may well be that the sisters worked together on some of these early works. McNair, the most prolific printmaker of the four, also made bookplates, the earliest of which was an etching exe- cuted in 1896 for the Glasgow builder, John Trumbull Knox. Knox was an important patron, acquiring two cabinets and a pair of sconces from him. Other bookplates were made for John Turner and for Albert Grunbaum, a specialist in his- tology who taught at the School of Tropical Medicine at University College, Liverpool. Grunbaum commissioned the Scot to make a diagram to illustrate Ehrlich's theory of immunity in an article that he published in The Lancet. McNair used lithography for a certificate of attendance at the School of Tropical Medicine, which was illustrated by Billcliffe. As he describes, stylized birds carry petals contain- ing the Dew of Inspiration gathered from the Tree of Knowledge. The idea probably stems in part from Joseph Rodman Drake's poem, The Fay and the Dew , first published in 1835. The Glasgow artist had exhibited a pastel of this title in his one-man show at Gutekunst's in London in 1898. A large bird and the Tree of Knowledge had also featured in his bookplate for John Turnbull Knox. Several of McNair's prints were collotypes. One no longer known today, The Legend of St Christopher, is described as a coloured stipple engraving. His last known print was a colour etching of 1910 that was used as a Christmas card. While on Merseyside McNair was involved in poster design as in Glasgow, but only the drawing for the poster of the first exhibition of the Liverpool Academy of Arts of 1901 survives. In Liverpool, where he was appointed instructor in design at the School of Architecture and Applied Art, he moved away from the Continental-influenced style of his Glasgow years to become closer in spirit to Burne-Jones and J. W. Waterhouse. The success of the more conservative Arts and Crafts vein of his predecessor Anning Bell may have encouraged him to adopt a less exotic mode. The subject-matter of the works both of McNair and of his wife remains to be elucidated. His prints suggest a strong commitment to Catholicism, and it is possi- ble that an investigation of popular devotional poetry would throw more light on his art. martin hopkinson JAMES PRYDE. The Fleming collection's exhibition of the work of James Pryde was the first exhibition of any size to be devoted to this artist outside Scotland for nearly 60 years, despite the fact that for over 50 years he lived south of the border. It was accompanied by the catalogue Rascals and Ruins: The Romantic Vision of James Pryde (London, The Fleming- Wyfold Art Foundation, 2006, 80 pp., 85 col. and 32 b. &amp; w. ills., £15), written by Cecilia Powell. As a printmaker, Pryde is best known for his short-lived partnership with William Nicholson as J. &amp; W. BeggarstafT, whose revolutionary posters startled the rather staid London art community of the day. Their work swiftly received inter- national recognition, but after less than seven years the two artists went their separate ways. Pryde had studied for just three months in Paris at the Académie Julien, where Nicholson also spent some time. There they must have encountered the work of the Nabis, from whom their own bold simplified forms and flat matt backgrounds derive. Pryde 's later prints were lithographs in a very different style. Powell, talking about his work as a whole, notes affini- ties with the work of Callot, Piranesi, Rowlandson, Hogarth and Doré. The last of these left the deepest imprint on Pryde's lithographs of rogues and rascals of 1906-07. The idea for an album seems to have been conceived at the start of the century, and as Powell posits, may have been an attempt to surpass Nicholson's Characters of Romance of 1900. She follows Sanford Schwartz in his suggestion that the title of the portfolio, Portraits of Celebrated Criminals , published by Sands &amp; Co. in London, as well as Edinburgh, was inspired by Dumas père's Crimes célébrés. Powell's reference to Daumier is particularly happy when one looks at the chiaroscuro of Sir Henry Irving as Dubosc (fig. 46) in the melo- PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, I</page><page sequence="11">52 NOTES 46.

PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, I</page><page sequence="12">NOTES 53 drama, The Lyons Mail. These prints may not have been a financial success. Powell notes their lack of unity compared with Nicholson's series of colour woodcuts. The only other print by Pryde recorded here is his colour lithograph, Invitation to Polo at Cowdray Park of 191 2, rather in the manner of Albert Rüther ston. Considerable detail is provided of the patronage of the artist by Annie, Lady Cowdray, who commissioned or pur- chased more than twenty of his paintings. Also included are selected reviews of Pryde's work in newspapers and journals, none of which, however, refers to his prints. One printmak- ing contemporary who was influenced by Pryde was his friend, Edward Gordon Craig. Powell points out the simi- larity between Craig's woodcut, The Taming of the Shrew of 1908, and Pryde's series of brooding bed paintings. Wood- engraving was particularly fitted for interpretations of the Scotsman's pictures, as can be seen from Léon Dalivel's The Sinister Interior, the frontispiece to Basil Macdonald Hastings's Ladies Half-way and Other Essays of 1927. MARTIN HOPKINSON CHARLES SHANNON. An exhibition of 40 lithographs by Charles Shannon from the collection of Mark Samuels Lasner, staged at the Delaware Art Museum, was accompa- nied by the catalogue Charles Shannon: Lithographs and Luminaries (Wilmington, DE, The Delaware Art Museum, 2006, 20 pp., 4 b. &amp; w. ills, free), written by Margaretta Frederick. To place the artist's work in context, the show also included prints by Lucien Pissarro, William Rothenstein, a drawing by Max Beerbohm, a copy of The Pageant, the annu- al edited jointly by Shannon and Gleeson White, and a book cover by Charles Ricketts. In a brief introduction, Frederick notes that Shannon's lithographs at first received greater appreciation in France than in Britain. Each print is accom- panied by a paragraph or two of commentary and the indi- vidual works are organized by theme. Sections are devoted to Aestheticism, the influence of Millais, the impact of the Pre-Raphaelites - meaning Rossetti as opposed to Millais - and Symbolist and Impressionist influences. This really encompasses second-hand Impressionism as seen as through Lucien Pissarro, rather than core Impressionism. It is true that Shannon, like Cézanne, was much interested in bathers, but the Englishman's approach was far closer to the paint- ings of his compatriots exhibiting at the Royal Academy than to the work of any Impressionist. Ker Xavier Roussel might have been a better comparison for outdoor nymphs. The importance for Shannon of the drawings of Watteau and the prints and pastels of Whisder is not neglected. One might have expected some mention of the Wagnerian litho- graphs of Fantin-Latour. The Venetian Renaissance was an abiding interest for both Ricketts and Shannon. In the House of Delia owes as much to Titian as to Rossetti. Although most of Shannon's prints were made between 1888 and 1897, later work was also well represented. Frederick reminds one that Conder collaborated with Shannon on The Pageant , and sug- gests that Shannon's use of fan shapes in the first decade of the twentieth century was inspired by the Australian's exam- ple. Not discussed is the Senefelder Club and the attitude of artists associated with it towards what, in the second half of the first decade of the twentieth century, must have seemed to some degree 'old hat'. Some of Shannon's finest litho- graphs were his portraits, but what did he think of them himself? They are mainly concentrated in the period 1894-96. The only later portrait shown here was a self-por- trait of 1905. Why did Shannon not make more? Not noted here is that a few of Shannon's lithographs such as The Romantic Landscape were part of the heritage built on by the Samuel Palmer-loving Goldsmiths' school of etchers, in par- ticular Robin Tanner. Shannon was clearly well aware of the etchings of the Shoreham master, martin hopkinson LUIGI RUSSOLO. For the very first time almost all the prints by the Futurist Luigi Russolo have been assembled in a single exhibition, which was shown at the Museo di Arte Moderna, Rovereto, and the Estorick Collection in London. The show was accompanied by an Italian catalogue, Luigi Russolo: Vita e opere di un futurista (Milan, MART and Skira Editore, 2006, 222 pp., 57 col. and 162 b. &amp; w. ills., €35), edit- ed by Franco Tagliapietra and Anna Gasparotto. The texts of the essays are available in English from the Estorick Collection in a CD-Rom, Luigi Russolo: Life and Works of a Futurist. Two essays by Daniele Lombardi and Carlo Montanaro are devoted to Russolo's music and musical machines, and to his use of these to accompany three short avant-garde films by Eugène Deslaw shown at Studio 28. Lombardi also publishes and comments on a letter of 19 August 192 1 from Russolo to the Futurist composer, Francesco Balilla Pratella, in which he describes his intonaru- mori and suggests how they should be used in a performance of II tamburo di fuoco. In addition, there is a very extensive bib- liography and exhibition history. The other five essays are written by Tagliapietra and Gasparotto, of which the first by Tagliapietra is the most relevant for print historians. Russolo's printmaking activity was spread over just half a dozen years, during which time he made 43 intaglio prints, 42 of which were shown in Rovereto and 40 in London. Two of them are aquatints that have been discovered since Maffina listed Russolo's work in 1977. Morfina was executed on the other side of the plate for Mamma che cuce and Donna pipistrel- lo on the other side of the plate for Città addormentata. It is argued here that both these prints preceded the already known aquatints. The impressions of the newly discovered works in the show were both modern, and we do not know if Russolo pulled any of the latter in his lifetime. Thirty of the plates survive in the possession of the artist's family. Study of these has enabled Tagliapietra to amend the chronology proposed by Maffina, who had posited three periods of printmaking activity, in 1907, 1909-10 and 191 1. In the pre- sent account, the development in Russolo's work is more credible. Tagliapietra assigns a group of seventeen naturalis- tic landscapes and portraits to the artist's time in Paris between 1906 and 1907. Maffina had allotted them to Russolo's middle period of printmaking, in 1909-10. Tagliapietra argues that all these prints preceded the artist's involvement with Symbolism, and regards the mezzotint II redentore and the two recently discovered aquatints as the ear- PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, I</page><page sequence="13">54 NOTES liest works to show Symbolist interests. Maffina had seen the nine Symbolist prints as Russolo's first ventures. Tagliapietra prefers to date them to 1908-09. He notes that Previati had produced similar images to Russolo's Donna pipistrello when illustrating Edgar Allan Poe in 1887-90 and in an oil of 1906. Reference to Russolo's oils is no help for his early work, as none of his known paintings dates before 1908. Russolo first exhibited prints in May 1909, when he sent three etchings to the 10th Munich International exhibition. This is known from a previously unpublished document. His exhibits included Morfina, Medio Evo and what is arguably his masterpiece in printmaking, the aquatint II Trionfo della morte (fig. 47). In December 1909 Russolo also exhibited a group of prints at La Famiglia Artistica in Milan, one of which was his portrait of Nietzsche with his head seemingly entangled in a woman's hair, as in a Munch. This was reproduced on the cover of the catalogue and titled on an impression still in the family as Nietzsche e la pazzia. Close in date is the mez- zotint Profumo , the composition of which resembles a paint- ing by Boccioni. It seems that Russolo's print preceded his painting of the same subject, in which the female head is reversed. Tagliapietra notes that Ilaria Schiaffini has sug- gested that Russolo's invention of the composition preceded Boccioni's. The two men had first met early in 19 10. Schiaffini attributed the synaesthesia in both paintings to the ideas of Previati, Conçoni and Khnopff. By contrast, Tagliapietra sees Russolo's etchings and aquatints of his mother, his views from balconies and of the suburbs, as inspired by Boccioni's similar work. One print stands apart in this group of works, which Tagliapietra dates to 1910 - Chioma , an aquatint in which the artist's sister's chin and cheeks are wrapped up in her long tresses. Although it is placed here at the end of the sequence of plates assigned to 1 9 10, and an impression is signed and dated 19 10, stylistical- ly its conception could well date from the previous year. As Tagliapietra notes, the subject was adumbrated in one of Russolo's earliest etchings, I capelli di Tina , and there is an oil of this subject in a private collection. Tagliapietra quotes from a letter that Russolo wrote on 13 January 191 1 to Vittore Grubicij, in which the artist may have been attempt- ing to sell his prints. It might have been lack of commercial interest that led to his abandonment of printmaking, apart from two last plates of 191 2-13, represented here by Movimenti simultanei di una donna, a not altogether successful Futurist etching, aquatint and drypoint, vaguely related to his oil in the Musée de Grenoble, Sintesi plastica dá movimenti di una donna. Other scholars doubtless will analyse the relations 47. Luigi Russolo, Il Trionfo della Morte , 1918, etching and aquatint, 234 x 401 mm (Glasgow, Hunterian Art Gallery). PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, I</page><page sequence="14">NOTES 55 between Russolo's prints and the work of his contemporaries in greater depth. It appears that in Paris he was occasional- ly attracted to the work of such artists as Aman-Jean and Armand Point. Knowledge of Ensor's prints can probably be discerned in his 1909 aquatints, Maschere and Superbia-avarizia-lussuria. Carezza-morte is strangely reminis- cent of the work of the Scottish etcher William Strang, and the magnificent Trionfo della morte must surely reflect Hodler. Literary sources may also be found. Gasparotto discusses Russolo's interest in the occult and in esoteric and theo- sophical thought, which she sees as reflected in such etchings as Nietzsche and Profumo. She plausibly suggests that Edgar Allan Poe's stories Berenice and Ligeia may have been the sources for his inspiration in making the recendy discovered etching of a batwoman. martin hopkinson LÉON SPILLIAERT. The Bibliothèque Royale, Brussels, last year celebrated the 60th anniversary of the death of Léon Spilliaert by staging an exhibition of the drawings and prints by the artist in its possession. The litde-known draw- ings were mainly acquired between 1957 and i960 from the artist's widow, Rachael Vergison-Spilliaert. The library owns 188 works, making its holdings three times the size of that of the Museum voor Schone Künsten in Ostend and four times that of the Musées Royaux des Beaux- Arts in Brussels, the two best known collections of works on paper by Spilliaert. The library is exceptionally rich in drawings from the peri- od 1900 to 1905. The exhibition was accompanied by the catalogue, Léon Spilliaert dans les collections de la Bibliothèque royale de Belgique (Brussels 2006, 114 pp., 19 col. and 302 b. &amp; w. ills., €15), written by Alain Jacobs with the assistance of Anne Adriaens-Pannier. Spilliaert's prints have attracted scholarly interest only in the last 25 years, following an exhibition in 1982 at the Ostend Museum, and they remain relatively understudied. The Brussels show provided the best opportunity so far for appreciating this aspect of his work. The Bibliothèque owns his complete etched work. Spilliaert began making prints in 1908, devoting himself to etching and drypoint. Two of these works, A Bather and A Young Girl Singing, are known only from impressions in the Brussels library. Much better known are his group portrait in drypoint of himself with Emile Verhaeren and the publisher Edmond Deman, and his aquatint dating from 1908 of Verhaeren by himself. Spilliaert's interest in intaglio printmaking may have been encouraged by contact in Paris with the print dealer and publisher, Clovis Sagot. Spilliaert made no further prints until 19 17, when he took up lithography. According to Adriaens-Pannier, the impetus came from the architect Léon Sneyers, who gave Spilliaert a one-man exhibition in his Brussels gallery the following year. The artist worked with transfer paper and relied on profes- sionals to print his lithographs. He was accustomed to mak- ing watercolour or crayon additions. The library has copies of all three of his albums of lithographs, which were pub- lished in 1918 and 1919. The authors of the catalogue asso- ciate the nostalgic images in Plaisirs d'Hiver with Pieter Bruegel's famous winter scenes. This is a rare reference made to work by other artists. For this catalogue, on the whole, makes little effort to place Spilliaert's art in context. Preparatory drawings for eight of the ten prints are owned by the Bibliothèque. Spilliaert touched every impression of the landscape lithographs in Sites brabançons in crayon, thus making each work unique. The preparatory drawings for this set of prints are slightly larger than the finished works. These first two albums have no evident literary sources. His final portfolio, however, illustrated Maeterlink's Serres chaudes. All three copies of it in the library were touched by Spilliaert, one of them in Chinese ink as well as in crayon. Also in this Brussels collection is an impression of Claire de lune au large ďOstende, Frans Ermengem's colour woodcut to Spilliaert's design. No date is assigned here to this print. A number of other reproductive woodcuts by Ermengem, after artists such as William Degouves de Nuncques, Valerius De Sadeleer and Constantin Meunier in the library's collection are recorded here. The Bibliothèque Royale owns at least one copy of each of Spilliaert's six limes d'artiste , discussion of which in this publication preceded that of his prints. Mostly, he provided drawings for these de-luxe publications. Only in the case of Horace Van Offel's Contes , published in Brussels by Editions des Artistes in 1935, did Spilliaert provide an etching, as did 21 other Belgian artists. This print is his last known etching. He also made a single-block print for the journal LArt libre of 15 April 1919, the only known impression of which is in the Brussels library. Scholars have not decided for certain whether this is a linocut or a woodcut, martin hopkinson BROCKHURST. The University of Georgia has fol- lowed its 1993 exhibition of the work of Gerald Leslie Brockhurst with a second show at the Georgia Museum of Art, drawn from the collection of one of the artist's pupils, the lawyer and philanthropist Jacob Burns (1902-93). Burns, who became a close friend of Brockhurst, painted portraits of judges and lawyers in a style much indebted to his master. The exhibition included a self-portrait drawing and two oils by Burns, one of which was a portrait of Brockhurst in his 70s, and 32 etchings and four lithographs by Brockhurst. The show was accompanied by Romita Ray's catalogue, The Eternal Masquerade: Prints and Paintings by Gerald Leslie Brockhurst (i8go-igj8) from the Jacob Burns Foundation (Athens, GA, Georgia Museum of Art, 2006, 132 pp., 26 col. and 21 b. &amp; w. ills., $28). Brockhurst's work was already well-known in America when he settled there in 1939. Ray records the purchase in 1930 of nine of his etchings by the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. She also discusses Brockhurst's use of picturesque costume in his portraits and fancy pieces, placing this prac- tice in the context of a tradition that goes back to the seven- teenth century and to the fashion for aesthetic dress pro- mulgated by the Pre-Raphaelites and the artists associated with the Aesthetic Movement. Ray follows Shelley E. Zuraw in noting a resemblance between Brockhurst's Black Silk Dress and the famous painting from Raphael's studio of Giovanna d'Aragona, which he would have had the oppor- tunity to study in the Louvre. Comparisons are also made PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 200 J, I</page><page sequence="15">56 NOTES with the portraits of Rubens, Van Dyck and Velázquez. The last of these is a little far-fetched in terms of portraiture. More convincing is the perception of a link in the use of a mirror between Brockhurst's most famous print, Adolescence , and The Rokeby Venus. The artist's dependence on the por- traiture of the Italian Quattrocento and Cinquecento, nur- tured by his travels on a scholarship to France and Italy, has long been recognized. It is also clear that this Birmingham artist was much inspired by the tumbling hair of the Pre- Raphaelite beauties on display in his local museum and art gallery. Ray reminds us of instances of Pre-Raphaelite rep- resentations of women's absorption in their own beauty. She associates Jeunesse Dorée with Millais's The Bridesmaid. Although Brockhurst's prints were frequendy based on ear- lier paintings, their appearance is often quite different. Sometimes the backgrounds are changed from outdoor settings to interiors. Skilful use of chiaroscuro enabled him to create far more effective representations in black and white of his artist friends, Rushbury and McBey. In these etchings, Brockhurst quite deliberately tried to rival mezzotint. MARTIN HOPKINSON THE RUPF COLLECTION. Herrmann Rupf, a 27- year-old from Berne, was the first client of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler when he opened his gallery in Paris in 1907. He immediately purchased two canvases by Derain and Vlaminck. The following year he accompanied the dealer to Picasso's studio, where he saw the Desmoiselles ď Avignon and acquired two fine gouaches. At the beginning of the century Rupf had worked side by side with Kahnweiler in the Commerz und Diskonto-Bank in Frankfurt, before they both left for Paris in 1902, where they were assiduous visitors to the various Salons and to the Louvre. Both of them began to buy prints. Kahnweiler acquired works by Cézanne, Manet and Renoir; Rupf, works by Steinlen and Toulouse- Lautrec. In 1905 he joined the haberdasher's company run by his brother-in-law, Ruedi Hossmann. For the rest of his career Rupf worked for Hoffmann and Rupf, until he final- ly retired in 1955. There was a family business interest in the visual arts, as his elder brother Emil had founded a colour merchants in Berne and later opened a second shop in Zurich. Herrmann Rupf and his wife Margrit, whom he married in 19 10, put together a remarkable collection of avant-garde art, for which they created a foundation in 1954. Two years later the collection was exhibited at the Kunstmuseum in Berne, which was overnight raised from a provincial institution to a museum of international quality. In 1969, seven years after Rupf's death, the museum pub- lished a catalogue of the collection. The Musée de Grenoble has now mounted Braque, Klee, Leger . . . L'art de collectioner , the first major exhibition of the collection outside Switzerland. Prints form a relatively small, but far from insignificant part of the Rupf collection. For he was one of the first to appreciate Fauve woodcuts. His acquisitions of prints by Derain were discussed by Jane Lee in 'L'enchanteur pour- rissant', Revue de l'Art, lxxxii, 1988, pp. 51-60. Nineteen woodcuts, all from c. 1906, are presented here. The collec- tion also owns ten of Derain's early drypoints and five sig- nificant livres d'artiste that were not included in the exhibition. Fourteen of the sixteen proofs by Vlaminck that Rupf acquired from Kahnweiler in 1913 and 19 14 were virtually hot off the press. Christine Poullain provides a brief essay on these latter works, stressing the influence on Vlaminck of Cézanne, the German Expressionists and Van Gogh. Also among the prints selected for the Grenoble exhibi- tion were ten lithographs by Picasso dating from 1921 to 1924, out of the 40-odd prints owned by Rupf, and two very early etchings by Klee. Rupf first bought prints by Klee in 1914, works that are no longer in the collection. Anxious to support the artist, he frequently bought directly from him. Stefan Frey describes the close friendship between the two men that ended only with Klee's death. At one time Rupf owned 124 works by Klee. On occasion the artist sent his patron prints as Christmas presents, including the 1931 etch- ing Pique the Clown in that year and the rare 1901 Poisson aven- tureux the following year. Rupf bought the 1932 aquatint La Sainte X in January 1933. Lily Klee, the artist's widow, also sent Rupf an impression of the 1923 colour lithograph Funambule as a birthday present in 1941. Seven prints by Klee previously owned by Rupf entered the collection of the Berne Museum through the Fondation Paul Klee. The artist whose work is best represented in the Rupf col- lection is André Masson. Rupf acquired over 50 prints by the Frenchman, although none was included in this exhibition. Most of them were probably acquired from Kahnweiler. Rupf continued to purchase prints by Masson after World War II. He also owned seven prints by Kandinsky dating between 19 12 and 1940, all acquired in 1961 long after the Russian's death. These too were not exhibited in Grenoble. The other principal groups of prints and livres d'artiste in the Rupf collection that were not included here are those by Gris, Braque, and in particular Laurens. Rupf also owned a very rare series of linocuts by Cesar Dómela, dating from 1924. The earliest print in the collection is by Bastien- Lepage and its range extends to the post-war work of Leger. Although none of the longer essays in the catalogue touches on Rupf's interest in prints, two in particular deserve men- tion. Malcolm Gee places his collecting in the context of that of his contemporaries, the New Yorker John Quinn and the Swiss collectors Raoul La Roche and Gottlieb Friedrich Rebel. Konrad Tobler discusses Rupf as a businessman, phil- anthropist and socialist. A separate publication with the same title as the catalogue (34 pp* 5 no ills.) contains important essays by Susanne Friedli and Samuel Vitali, devoted respectively to Rupf's dealings with Swiss artists and to his work as an art critic. Rupf was art critic of the newspaper of the Social Democratic party, Berner Taguuacht , from 1909 to 193 1. He wrote mostly on Swiss artists and it appears that he did not often refer to prints, although he was more critical of the woodcuts of Pechstein and Munch than of their paintings. He regarded Munch's prints as too literary. A significant number of Swiss artists were represented in Rupf's collection, but many of the works were not transferred to the ownership of the Fondation Rupf, perhaps because he realized that they did not match the quality of the works at the heart of the collection. Friedli PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, I</page><page sequence="16">NOTES 57 records that he owned lithographs by Otto Nebel, who had left Germany for Switzerland in 1933. Nebel added a colour linocut to these as a Christmas gift in 1938. Rupf also owned lithographs by Albert Schnyder. We do not learn here whether there were other Swiss prints in his collection. MARTIN HOPKINSON FRANÇOIS LUNVEN. The work of the short-lived Parisian painter and intaglio printmaker, François Lunven (1942-71), is comparatively little known. His work, which belongs to the late Surrealist strain that is also represented by Fred Deux, was recently shown in the museum at Issoudun. The exhibition was accompanied by the catalogue François Lunven (Issoudun, Musée de l'Hospice Saint-Roch and Paris, Galerie Alain Margaron, 2005, 144 pp., 40 col. and 68 b. &amp; w. ills., €23), to which Gérard Durozol, Manuel Jover, the poet Bernard Noël and the Cuban printmaker Ramon Alejandro contributed. Trained in printmaking by Jacques and Robert Frélaut at the Atelier Lacourière- Frélaut, Lunven made over 100 etchings, drypoints and mez- zotints in less than a decade. He also produced one major livre d'artiste , Julien Gracq's Au château d'Argot , published by Francs-Bibliophiles in 1968. Lunven's complete graphic work was exhibited in the Mairie of Douarnenez in 1981, and Manuel Jover made a study of his prints in a catalogue published by the Galerie Alain Margaron in 1997. From the very start of his career Lunven exhibited a remarkable technical facility and a penchant for meticulous description. His source material was the world of bugs and other microscopic insects, which he transmuted into fantas- tic creatures of his own. Steeped in mystical Surrealist writ- ing, Lunven also admired the work of the scientific philoso- pher, Monod-Herzen. The results of his reading introduce us to a disturbing dream world filled with bulging eyes, claws and pincers. It is not surprising that one of his prints is an extraordinary portrait of Georges Bataille as an insect with prominent sexual features. This mixed method work was printed in a velvety violet. The preparatory drawing and the notes that Lunven made to accompany it are analysed here by Noël. Many of his prints, in their compositions set against blank backgrounds, share some of the qualities of certain Pop artists of the 1960s. One thinks particularly of Hervé Télémaque and Peter Phillips. Occasionally Lunven's crea- tures float in a space that uncannily resembles frames fea- turing alien spaceships in early episodes of Star Trek. Lunven's early work was zoomorphic. This was soon suc- ceeded by an anthropomorphic period in which there are obvious echoes of Bellmer. For a short period in 1964, black and white were reversed in a series of heavily worked etch- ings of a maelstrom of Bosch-like monsters lit by mysterious internal light. Manuel Jover refers to the diableries of C allot, to the packed crowds in some Rembrandts and to the weird lighting of Bresdin. By 1967 a new element is introduced. Some creatures are entirely metallic, others combine natur- al and mechanically made elements. Some of Lunven's prints became very large, up to a metre long. Noël also dis- tinguishes a final fourth period of 1970-71, which he describes as religious. None of these latter prints, however, are included in this catalogue. Jover also relates Lunven's work to Jean Duvet. Noël tells us how Lunven coined the world scathéologie for Bataille 's thought, a word echoed in the artist's prints by the orifices and extrusions displayed in them. Alejandro tells of Lunven's fascination in the contents of the Musée Moreau, of his obsession with Pontormo and of his day-dreaming over Grünewald. Several of the con- tributors to the catalogue refer to Lunven's reading of the work of philosophers and of second generation Surrealist writers, martin hopkinson THE STAMPERIA D'ARTE ALBICOCCO. Corrado Albicocco and Federico Santini, both of whom had studied at Urbino's celebrated Scuola del Libro, began work as intaglio printers in Udine in 1974. At first it was only a pas- time, but for Albicocco it grew to be a profession, and in 1994 he opened the Stamperia Albicocco on his own account. His activity has been celebrated at the Galleria Spazzapan in Gradisca dell' Isonzo in Friuli with an exhibi- tion and a catalogue, Aspetti dell' incisione contemporanea Europea. La Stamperìa d'Arte Albicocco (Gradisca dell' Isonzo, Galleria Regionale ď Arte Contemporanea Luigi Spazzapan, 2006, 144 pp., 68 col. and 47 b. &amp; w. ills.), with short essays by Floriano de Santi and Roberto Budassi, as well as a record of the 30 livres d'artiste that Albicocco has published between 1994 and 2006 under the imprint of Edizioni del Tavolo Rosso. The exhibition itself, however, included quite a num- ber of prints made before the opening of the workshop. Among them were a magnificent series of aquatints created by Emilio Vedova between 1972 and 1986. Jiři Kolár was represented by a group of etchings and collages of 1990 that combine Surrealism, lettrisme and the Czech tradition of Geometric Constructivism. The lyrical colour aquatints and soft-ground etchings of Giuseppe Santomaso, who died in 1990, demonstrate quality printmaking in the Veneto of an older generation. Nowhere is it said whether these works were printed by Albicocco. In 2003 Vedova did make two limes d'artiste - Frammenti , and Massimo Cacciari's L'angelo di Vedova - with the Stamperia Albicocco. The first two volumes to issue from the presses were illus- trated by Giuseppe Zigaina. Since then he has made one further livre d'artiste on his own and contributed to three other publications. Two of the printmakers who have worked with Albicocco, Arnoldo Ciarrocchi and Nunzio Gulino, like him studied in Urbino. Edizioni del Tavolo Rosso's first non-Italian collaborator was the Bosnian Safet Zee, who has produced two books with them. The publish- er has also issued livres d'artiste by the Slovenian Franco Dugo and the German Klaus Karl Mehrkens. The outstanding Italian of a younger generation whose work is included here is the Roman, Piero Pizzi Cannella. Four etchings from his book Storie di bordo , published in 2003, a freely drawn ground plan, a fantasy map and a design for a pagoda are illustrat- ed. Albicocco has worked with figurative and abstract print- makers alike. Carlo Ciussi and Livio Schiozzi are the most interesting Italian etchers to work in abstract modes to be seen here. Other artists in the exhibition from outside Italy include the Czech Albert Merz, the Serb Vladimir PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, I</page><page sequence="17">58 NOTES Veličkovič, the Austrian Franz Schwarzinger, the Bosnian Mersad Berber, the Slovenian artists' collective, Irwin, and the Englishman David Tremlett, whose brilliant coloured aquatints that echo the work of such artists as Edgar Pillet are among the most successful works in this catalogue. MARTIN HOPKINSON ARNALDO POMODORO. The 8oth birthday of Arnaldo, the elder of the Pomodoro brothers, has recendy been celebrated with the exhibition, Arnaldo Pomodoro Opere 1960-2005', which was shared between (Reggio Emilia, Palazzo Magnani and Correggio, Palazzo dei Principi, 24 June-8 October 2006) Reggio Emilia and Correggio, appropriate venues given that he was born in the little town of Morciano in the Romagna. The accompanying catalogue, Arnaldo Pomodoro : Opere 1960-2005, edited by Sandro Parmeggiani (Skira Editore, 2006, 254 pp., 141 col. and 75 b. &amp; w. ills., €42) included an interview with the artist by Parmeggiani and an essay by Luciano Caprile. A selec- tion of Pomodoro 's poetry was also included and an exten- sive anthology of critical writings on his work. The appen- dices cover a chronology, a very full list of exhibitions and a bibliography, as well as a record of the artist's writings and filmography. Pomodoro's early training in surveying, begun in Rimini before World War II, was probably significant in attuning him to the possibilities of the use of marks and signs. No doubt this interest was strengthened by his study from the early 1950s of the work of Klee. Pomodoro's artistic training from 1949 at the Istituto d'Arte in Pesaro was in the field of theatre design, but until 1957 he had to earn a living as a civil engineer, practising sculpture only in his spare time. Significant for the development of his style was a meeting that year in Paris with Giacometti. In 1959 Pomodoro visit- ed the United States for the first time, travelling to New York and San Francisco, where he encountered many leading American Abstract artists. He met Louise Nevelson at the Gallery Viviano, and she introduced him to David Smith. Pomodoro was frequently in the USA in the 1960s. He was artist in residence at Stanford University in 1966 and visiting Professor at the University of Berkeley in 1968 and 1970. He returned to California in 1977-78 to teach at Mills College, Oakland, for four years. It is undisputed that his American experience was impor- tant for his development. However, in some ways his sculp- ture has more in common with that of South American artists. Sculpture from South America was frequently exhib- ited in the USA during this period, and one would like to know if Pomodoro met any leading South American sculp- tors. The compartmentalization in the first livre d'artiste in this catalogue, Jorge Luis Borges's Siete poemas sajones of 1974, is not so far removed from the Torres-Garcia tradition. The volume contains three low relief bronzes, and from this date onwards Pomodoro's livres d'artiste have included bronzes as well as intaglio prints, almost as if he regarded the two as interchangeable. Indeed, some of his most recent plates in these books take on the appearance of metal reliefs. The cover for Miklos N. Varga's De-cantare Urbino, published in 1985 by Edizioni della Pergola in Pesaro, is a bronze relief, while etchings appear on its pages. Pomodoro's earliest known prints were made at the start of the 1970s and first exhibited at the Ca' Pesaro in 1971. He won the Gran Premio Città di Firenze at the third Biennale della Grafica d'Arte in 1972. Throughout the 1970s he worked with Valter and Eleonora Rossi, of the Stamperia 2RC. The Galleria 2RC mounted an exhibition of his prints in 1978, the catalogue for which was accompanied by a fine text by Giovanni Carandente. From the start Pomodoro treated printmaking as an extension of his sculpture - for him it was another form of relief sculpture. In his interview with Parmeggiani he stated that he had always worked with clay in the negative. The serried marks in Pomodoro's early etchings have been likened to Hittite inscriptions and cuneiform. They also carry echoes of musical scores and the interiors of pianos and pianoroles. Pomodoro admires Tadin, as is evident from his columns. Equally apparent is that he is one of the heirs of the Futurists. Some of his prints contain piston-like objects. The central motifs in the series of Aste cielaň, high relief intaglio prints made with Garner Tullis in San Francisco in 1980-82, are reminiscent of parts of industrial machinery. On occasion, the powerful diagonal lines of force of Futurist derivation raise memories of Uccello 's Battle of San Romano. In 1987 Pomodoro began to use vesica-like shapes, the interiors of which filled with metal- lic-looking insects with aggressive sharply pointed limbs and arrow heads. His apdy tided series Sogni of 1989-93 glow with jewel-like colour. Pomodoro has also designed some remarkable jewellery. The Sogni were followed in 1995 by Segnali , four variants each printed in a different colour, in which the spears and shafts that cross the central geometri- cal forms seem to pay homage to El Lissitzky. From 1996 Pomodoro radically reduced the brilliance of his colours, first in a group of white blind prints made with Garner Tullis. Mysterious flat elongated shapes stand out in high relief against the background of his familiar regiment- ed marks, which, as the series progress, form themselves into falling limbs and figures. These figures continue in the single colour Tracce , made with Stamperia 2RC in 1998. The fig- ures, always upside down, now sometimes seem to perform some mysterious dance. They stand out lighter in tone than their background, which has the appearance of layers of thin slices of paper, the irregular edges of which have a halluci- natory effect. Some of these etchings are very long in rela- tion to the height. Pomodoro's Stele of 1999 relate to enor- mous bronze columns begun in 1997. Only one print in the exhibition was not intaglio , a screenprint made with Arte 3 in Milan in 2002, in which a shell-like form is made up of metallic motifs. Pomodoro has made lithographs. A one- man show of 1975 at the Galleria Corsini, Intra, was tided Disegni - Litografie - Sculture . His livres d'artiste have been print- ed in single colours, apart from Attilio Bertolucci's 1993 poems, La gioia delle rose e del cielo , printed and published by Edizioni Proposte d'arte Colophon in Belluno. The same publisher issued his Dintorni di Alix, a tribute to Alix Cavaliere, and Gillo Dörfles 's Nascosti Intrecci. The latest of his volumes is Emilio Villa's L'Arte dell'uomo prìmordiale of PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, I</page><page sequence="18">NOTES 59 2004, commissioned by Edizioni Cento Amici del Libro in Milan, a far cry in its boldness from the volumes issued by this society in its early years in the 1940s, when its president was Ugo Ojetti. Although each plate only measures 300 x 630 mm they all ooze monumentality, martin hopkinson PRINTMAKERS IN THE AGE OF ANXIETY Since 1963 a small group of print enthusiasts has organized a reg- ular exhibition in the town of Biella. The spring of 2006 was the sixteenth occasion. Usually a curator is invited who selects and presents printmakers whom he or she thinks are outstanding. This time it was Jeremy Lewison, and he has achieved in what was admittedly a very personal selection, probably the best and widest ranging collection of very con- temporary printmaking [Premio Biella per l'Incisione 2006, Arte neWêta dell'ansia - Art in the Age of Anxiety, 16a edizione/ 16th edi- tion , Biella, 19 March-4 June 2006, Museo del Territorio Biellese, Milan, Skira Editore, 2006, 228 pp., 169 col. and 18 b. &amp; w. ills.). Interestingly, Lewison has chosen prints that capture a kind of Zeitgeist , and deal with the increasing anxiety after 9/ 1 1 and the threat posed by radical religious movements and terrorism. In explaining his starting point, Lewison out- lines his perspective on the past few years, recalling not just the bombings but also growing racism and negative forms of patriotism. These issues not only impacted political life and debate in Western societies, but produced new images and conceptual approaches in all cultural areas. It is essentially this idea of following the political, cultural and religious implications as well as major natural catastrophes - all of which left their mark on contemporary printmaking - that forms the framework for Lewison's selection. In his short essay, 'Impressions and Reflections', he explains his person- al approach to contemporary printmaking, as well as sum- marizing the individual views of the various artists on their different subjects. The range of printmakers is impressive, both in origin and cultural background. With 35 artists from various countries the selection was extremely wide. This provided an opportunity to present works from different angles and new perspectives, and also reveals certain points in common. The five sections of the book are not equal. Although many of the artists could be assigned to more than one section and therefore cross the proposed boundaries of the structure, the arrangement at least offers a way in to understanding their respective works. On this basis, works by printmakers as diverse as Yun-Fei Ji, Enrique Chagoya, Carole Benzaken, Adrian Schiess with his two meditative series on XXX colours and Vorbei , Walton Ford, Olaf Nicolai, Julie Mehre tu, and Mona Hatoum with her portfolio, Hair, There and Everywhere , become linked to one another through their choice of sub- ject and in the treatment of their work. They all, in one way or another, contain political implications - 'Expressing the political', as Lewison describes it - without being too obvi- ously related to it. They often seem neutral, but on second glance they unveil their consciousness and political back- ground. The same applies to those prints dealing with aspects of daily life. The overlooked and the ordinary ('Looking at the Overlooked'), which often seems to be not worth examining, when put into focus develops a compelling power. The artists involved here are Miroslaw Balka, Gabriel Orozco, Michael Landy, Sovann Kim with her large-scale ink-jet prints depicting parts of plants, but evok- ing other associations as well, Joseph Grigely, Jane Hammond and Christiane Baumgartner with her impres- sive print of a Transall military aircraft [see article, pp. 21-37]. They concentrate on themes that are not easy to grasp and are often overlooked because they are not spec- tacular. The third section deals with the 'Demise of the Ideal'. Günther Förg's series ' To the Builders' pays strong tribute to the Bauhaus architecture of Tel Aviv, while Jake and Dinos Chapman, represented not by their altered Goya prints, but by My Giant Colouring Book , visualize the vulnerability of chil- dren. This is also one of the themes of the prints by Kiki Smith, which - as in other works by her - convey a deeply emotional point. Similarly disturbing are the prints by Tal R or Linda Schwartz. With Per Kirkeby, Terry Frost and espe- cially The Colour Spectrum by Olafur Eliasson, more positive aspects are added. The fourth section is devoted to the 'Conundrum of Space' and includes works by Pistoletto, Guillermo Kuitca, William Kentridge, Rachel Whiteread, Richard Hamilton and Terry Winters. Together with the fifth section on 'Looking for Stability', with prints by Goshka Macuga, Jim Dine, Richard Tuttle and Sophie Calle, this is the least chal- lenging part of the book, not creating any feeling of discom- fort or showing prints that are highly thought-provoking. It would be unfair to judge these artists too hard, however, as they present aspects of current societies, questions and prob- lems. They simply have different qualities from the more political prints, from prints dealing with questions of per- ception of the ideal or putting into focus events, plants or objects that are usually overlooked. This is of course all high- ly personal, but the great achievement of this catalogue is to evoke such feelings, to give space to these ideas and to pro- vide printed visual reference to various aspects of current societies. It does not present an objective canon of prints made over the past few years, which is something that no exhibition of contemporary works can do, but it shows direc- tions and canvasses interesting ideas. One should be grateful to Lewison for his selection and for the contemporary issues he raises in Art in the Age of Anxiety. It will be interesting to return to this catalogue in a few years time and look at these prints again. CHRISTIAN RÜMELIN PRINTS AT THE E.T.H. The Graphische Sammlung (Department of Prints and Drawings) of the Swiss Federal Technical Institute (E.T.H.), the former Federal Polytechnic in Zurich, has an excellent reputation among collectors of works on paper. For several years they have produced a notable number of scholarly publications concentrated mostly on their print collections, often providing a summary of latest research and opening up new fields. The scope of the collection itself is wide, including drawing, printmaking, photography, illustrated books and artists' books, to name PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, I</page><page sequence="19">6o NOTES just the most important categories. Its chronological range is equally extensive, from early Old Master prints and single- sheet woodcuts, metalcuts and early engravings to contem- porary drawing, artists' books, printmaking and photogra- phy. Ein Bildhandbuch - A Visual Handbook , by Paul Tanner and Michael Matile (Basel, Schwabe, 2005, 488 pp., 80 colour and 300 b. &amp; w. ills., CHF78, €51) is one of five pub- lications to celebrate the foundation of the Polytechnic 150 years ago. The Graphische Sammlung was founded a few years after the inauguration of the Polytechnic, but quickly grew into one of the leading institutions in Switzerland. Paul Tanner describes in some detail its development and the collectors who contributed to its remarkable wealth of works on paper. The history of this collection is characterized by its individ- ual donors and therefore reflects to some degree their per- sonal preferences. Admittedly some of them tried to fill in the gaps, but most of the strengths - and perhaps some weaknesses - may be explained through their interest. Of course, all Keepers of this collection also tried to do their best to fill in gaps, but as in most public institutions this was not always possible. It is therefore better to focus on the wealth and strength of this collection. Some areas had already been covered in catalogues published in recent years, and it is not surprising that early Italian printmaking, chiaroscuro woodcuts or the prints by Lucas van Leyden are given prominence in the present catalogue. Nevertheless, interesting discoveries can be made. The catalogue, apart from the introduction by Tanner on the history of the col- lection and some general remarks, consists of chapters deal- ing with different aspects of printmaking. Mostly they are in chronological order and arranged by schools, but some- times, as is the case with prints after other artworks - here still called reproduction engraving - they are grouped by subject. These two parts overlap to some extent, but they make printmaking more accessible for people who are not accustomed to works on paper. This kind of publication is a difficult task because of the tension between the scholarly desire to document works in as much detail as possible, and the more popular approach of presenting well-known images, or works by well-known artists, in a not too detailed form. Yet one has to concede that the Graphische Sammlung did a superb job in getting this right. The book is basically a picture handbook, with some introductory texts and the necessary captions for the images. Above all, it is an introduction to the collection itself, presenting its full range and scope. In two easily overlooked details the scholarly approach shines through. First, the book gives a long list of all exhibitions held at the Graphische Sammlung from its foundation to the present day, and second, a long list of artists represented in the collection. Indeed, one becomes curious to see the full version and not a cut-down one. But for most printmakers, Swiss or foreign, this list is already a resource tool for scholars and those interested in printmak- ing - besides the book's wonderful illustrations, christian RÜMELIN THE UNIVERSITY OF KENT. The University of Kent at Canterbury has recently begun to form a print collection, the modest first fruit of which was the exhibition 'The Awakening' at Keynes College, Canterbury, which was accompanied by a catalogue of the same name (Canterbury, University of Kent, 2006, 32 pp., 10 b. &amp; w. ills., free) edited by Ben Thomas and written by eleven of his students. Intended as a teaching collection, the first acquisitions ranged from woodcuts by Dürer and Burgkmair to a Wagnerian lithograph by Fantin-Latour. A second exhibi- tion at the Museum of Canterbury, 'Van Dyck Pinxiť, drawn largely from Ben Thomas's own collection, also had a catalogue {Van Dyck Pinxit , Canterbury, University of Kent, 2006, 34 pp., 8 b. &amp; w. ills., free) written by Thomas himself. At the heart of the show were ten engravings from The Iconography and ten from its continuation after Van Dyck's death. Thomas places them in the tradition that runs from the woodcut portraits of artists illustrating Vasari and Giovio, and the engravings organized by Hieronymous Cock to accompany the verses of Domenicus Lampsonius, as well as relating Van Dyck's enterprise to the etchings made by Ottavio Leoni while the Flemish master was in Italy. Also represented was Van Dyck's afterlife in Dutch and British mezzotints, martin hopkinson SOME PUBLICATIONS RECEIVED. The usual har- vest of small publications has arrived for notice. The most unusual is an elegant small booklet by Roberto Giovanelli entitled Vagabondaggi di Carta (Florence, Edizioni Polistampa, 2006, 72 pp., 82 col. and 2 b. &amp; w. ills., €9), which prints a speech given at the opening of an exhibition of book plates of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries held in 1996. The author is an artist who has taught in Bergamo, Bologna and is now based in Florence. His liking of the small art form that is the book plate is evident, and his belletrist essay is adorned with reproductions of a wide variety of Italian plates, mostly from the nineteenth century. At the other end of the spectrum is a 40-page American pamphlet from the Delaware Center for the Contemporary Arts, Eric Fischi : Prints and Drawings (Wilmington, DE, Delaware Center for the Contemporary Arts, 5 May-10 September 2006, 40 pp., 35 col. and 1 b. &amp; w. ills., $12). Fischi was a student of the West Nottingham Academy in Maryland, near Delaware, and the publication bears the stamp of honouring an alum- nus who has lent most of the works shown. They comprise Fischl's usual fare of nudes in curious poses, or in juxtaposi- tions that hint at uncomfortable unstated narratives. The third catalogue also comes from America, but is devoted to a French artist. This is Georges Rouault, and specifically his series Miserere et Guerre , and the thick cata- logue, George Rouaulťs Miserere et Guerre: This Anguished World of Shadows , by Holly Flora and Soo Yun Kang (New York and London, Museum of Biblical Art New York and D. Giles Ltd., London, 192 pp., 23 col. and 68 b. &amp; w. ills., $65 hb, $45 pp), accompanied an exhibition at the Museum of Biblical Art, New York, 30 March-28 May 2006. Rouault is now so unfashionable that it is difficult to think back to the 1950s, when he was enormously admired and widely regarded as being among the great modern artists. This can be observed PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, I</page><page sequence="20">NOTES 6 1 in the bibliography of this catalogue, where older texts vast- ly outnumber more recent ones. The catalogue is workman- like, but perhaps does not make enough of the oddness of the process by which they were made - photogravure plates after gouaches, which Rouault then completely overworked by hand. It was published too early to be able to benefit from the wealth of new information about Vollard, its publisher, in the magnificent catalogue of the recent exhibition in the Metropolitan Museum in New York (to be reviewed in these pages). ANTONY GRIFFITHS A NEW METHOD FOR DATING PRINTS. One important and always puzzling problem in dealing with Old Master prints is the lack of certainty about dating them, par- ticularly the impressions or editions of illustrated books. Often the only way of addressing the problem so far has been watermark research or on stylistic grounds. But, it seems, a new method has arisen. Recently S. Blair Hedges from the Pennsylvania State University proposed a new approach for dating prints and early books in an article for the Proceedings of the Royal Society (http: //www. journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;id=doi: io. 1098/ rspa.2006. 1736Ì. He came across the well-known problem that many early books and prints are not exacdy dated or datable, and used his scientific knowledge and methods to propose a new way of narrowing down the date ranges of printed material. During his research on maps and book illustrations, he realized that deterioration might be time-dependent and not, as often suggested, print-depen- dent, that is, linked to the print run or to the care taken dur- ing the printing process. He examined many prints and dis- covered a constant rate of deterioration, which according to him indicates a different profile for the damage of blocks and plates from that sustained during the printing itself. Blair Hedges scrutinized in detail several editions of Bordone's Isolam (1528, 1534, 1547 and one undated edition). The undated edition had been dated between 1537 and 1570, meaning that it was either the third edition or a much later fourth edition, later than even the last dated one. Without question it is important to know when a book including maps had its third or fourth edition, and in this particular case watermark research did not lead far. Nor did the acti- vity of the printers give any clue. For intaglio printmaking Blair Hedges concentrated on two publications, first, T. Porcacchi's L'isole più famose de mondo (S. Galginani and Girolamo Porro, Venice 1572, then again in 1576, 1590, 1604, 1605 and 1620) and second, G. A. Magini's Geographiae universae (S. Galginani de Karera, Venice 1596, then 1598 and 1621). Blair Hedges used a mostly statistical approach. He counted the line breaks in the woodcuts, correlating the number of breaks to the succession of editions on the one hand and to the publication data on the other hand. This provides a rate of breaks related to the intervals between the various editions. To support his analysis of the images, he examined the printer devices at the same time. These had been, as he describes it, 'skeletonized' to a single pixel in width, making various editions easier to compare. Breaks also become more visible and countable through specialist computer programs. For the intaglio prints, the digital images were auto-thresholded and the number of lines in previous- ly defined areas were then counted. The results, and espe- cially the similar results for different copies of the book from the same edition, indicate a close relation of damage between editions, and not within the print run of a single edition. It seems that the number of prints taken bore no relation to the amount of damage, at least for the woodcuts. This brings the undated edition of Isolano to i5Ö5± 1 .3 years, using the results from the three dated editions and extending the line to the results from the undated edition. Besides, it suggests that most blocks had been cut about ten years before the first edition appeared, except for one map, which was a copy after another map and had far fewer line breaks than the other prints. This one was probably cut just before the printing of the edition itself. For copper plates, he exam- ined the levels of grey proportionate to time. A thinning of lines again indicates a deterioration of the plate. This is closely related to the shape of etched or engraved lines. According to Blair Hedges, the fact that lines become thin- ner shows not that compression was a major factor in dam- aging the plates, but that only through oxidation had the lines on them been reduced. As the plates had been polished for a new print run, the deterioriation was not constant, but occurred in accordance with Blair Hedges' calculations. The author calls the phenomenon of deteriorating plates, 'print clock', but admits that more research is needed to interpret the degree of damage within a sequence of print runs. The key to understanding the appearance of a print or getting an idea of when a certain impression was taken is not a mechanical process or a statistical approach. The two extreme opinions, that damage is only caused by mishan- dling and by the printing process itself, and the solely time- based approach, do not lead to a full understanding of a print's appearance. Both are admittedly important and need to be kept in mind when looking at a print or particular impression. But many phenomena cannot be explained by the one or the other, nor can the frequent complaints by printmakers about careless printers who ruined their plates and thinned the lines be overlooked or explained away just by passage of time. The idea of regarding time as the major reason for a deteriorating plate or block is tempting. Yet, if one thinks of late editions of Dürer or Altdorfer woodcuts, to name two examples, it is not a sufficient explanation. It explains part of the damage, but not the heavy overall dam- age that can be found in some of these impressions. Printers, pressure, mishandling and the storage of some blocks or plates all left their traces in later editions. As these do not occur on a mathematical scale, it is difficult to take them into account. The same applies to prints that were either printed in a very small number, or have survived in only a few impressions. The basis for examination would be too small with these to achieve any robust result, especially if one thinks of fifteenth-century single-sheet woodcuts or engrav- ings, which often survive in only one or a few impressions. Here, watermark or paper research would probably lead to more reliable results than this new approach. However, Blair PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, I</page><page sequence="21">62 CATALOGUE AND BOOK REVIEWS Hedges' method has its merits, and may be useful to bear in mind especially for illustrated books. It often does not help for dating a particular illustration or when a block was cut, but it might give an indication of when an undated edition was produced. As in the case of the Porcacchi, this method could lend strong support to other observations or remarks on these editions, christian rümelin</page></plain_text>
