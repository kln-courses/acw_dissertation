Jackson Coleridge's Shorter Works and Fragments brings together a number of substantial essays that were not long enough to require volumes to themselves, among them his "Theory of Life," "Essays on the Principles of Genial Criticism," "Treatise on Method," "Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit," "On the Passions," and "On the Prometheus of Aeschylus." To these are added more than 400 other pieces, some of them fragmentary, many of them previously unpublished, ranging in date from school essays of the early 1790s to a discussion of the bullion controversy in 1834. The subject matter includes literature and language, theology, philosophy, politics, and science, but many less predictable topics (such as child labor laws, marriage, suicide, church history, the abolition of slavery, and the state of the colonies) also appear. By gathering this material and presenting it in chronological order, Shorter Works and Fragments reveals the development and major characteristics of Coleridge's seemingly inexhaustible variety.

Written mainly on Ulysses, they demonstrate anew his regard for Joyce's text in all its detail. "There is no doubt in my mind that Fritz Senn is not only the best living Joyce critic but probably the best Joyce has ever had."-Hugh Kenner $33.50 hardcover the end of kinship In this provocative commentary on Shakespeare's Measure for Measure, Marc Shell focuses on the play's basic themes of sexual extremism, exchange, and political order. At the crux of the play, he notes, the novice nun Isabella accuses her brother Claudio: "ls't not a kind of incest, to take life/From thine own sister's shame?" Shell's analysis shows exactly how Claudio's request is a kind of incest in a virtuoso reading that extends his earlier work on philosophical and literary economies. $15.95 paperback Measure for Measure, Incest, and the Ideal of Universal Siblinghood Marc Shell The Johns Hopkins University Press Hampden Station, Baltimore, Maryland 21211 - To order, call 1-800-537-5487.</page><page sequence="4">TheNew Historicism NEW FROM CALIFORNIA Inscribing the Time Shakespeare and the End of Elizabethan England ERIC S.

NUSSBAUM Among the first books to consider issues of empire in relation to literary texts of the eighteenth century, Torrid Zones offers a compelling revision of the history of feminism in a postcolonial context. Felicity Nussbaum argues that the need to control women's sexuality intensified as the demands of trade and colonization required an ever-larger, able-bodied population. Describing how women's reproductive labor was harnessed to that task, Nussbaum explores issues such as the production of life, of goods, and of desire. She also considers a variety of cultural practices (usually construed as exotic) in England and the empire, including polygamy, infanticide, prosti- tution, homoeroticism, and arranged marriages. $14.95 paperback The Autobiographical Subject GENDER AND IDEOLOGY IN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ENGLAND FELICITY A. NUSSBAUM Co-recipient of the American Association fior Eighlteentli-Century Stidies' Lontis Gottsclalk Prize "Acutely analyzes the construction of gendered character in canonical British autobiographical texts and provides provocative explorations outside the canon, particularly among first-person narratives by women."-Diacritics $16.95 softcover Passions of the Voice HYSTERIA, NARRATIVE, AND THE FIGURE OF THE SPEAKING WOMAN, 1850-1915 CLAIRE KAHANE In Passions of" the Voice Claire Kahane argues that the subversion of gender definitions promoted especially by feminism in the late nineteenth century profoundly unsettled Victorian narrative discourse. Exploiting the psychoanalytic theory of hysteria, Kahane moves through a number of texts that manifest an anxiety of imagination provoked by the figure of the speaking woman, both as narrative trope and as historical agent. The result is a body of fiction in which the narrative voice not only loses control of the story it tells but also ushers in modernist narrative poetics. $14.95 paperback The Johns Hopkins University Press Hampden Station, Baltimore, Maryland 21211 * To order, call 1-800-537-5487.</page><page sequence="7">Mfs Prepayment is required.
