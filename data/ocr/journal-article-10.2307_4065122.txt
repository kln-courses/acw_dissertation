PLEW Department of Anthropology, Boise State University, 1910 University Drive, Boise ID 83725, U.S.A. ABSTRACT-Archaeological investigations within lwokrama Forest document significant Archaic and Horticultural oc- cupations throughout the Reserve. Significantly, no evidence of earlier Paleoindian occupations (pre-7,000 B.P) is doc- umented. The Archaic Period from 7,000 to 3,000 B.P (before present) is characterized by a variety of site types including artificial stone depressions and sharpening grooves, petroglyphs and a lithic tool manufacturing station. Petroglyphs reflect the Enumerative and Fish Trap Petroglyph Traditions better known from the savannah and rivers in southern Guyana. Archaic Period sites are found along major rivers and in the Iwokrama Mountains. Horticultural Period occupations dating from 3,000 B.P to the Historic Period (mid-18th century), include eight archaeological sites that have produced a wide range of vessel forms similar to Koriabo, Taruma and Rupununi types found elsewhere in Guyana. The occurrence of polychrome types by 3,000 B.P indicates an early arrival of such styles in the area. INTRODUCTION The archaeology of lwokrama and the North Ru- pununi, Guyana (Fig. 1) is relatively unknown but has great potential for addressing important research questions in north-eastern South America. Investi- gations within the region are intended to provide much needed chronological control in establishing changes in the historic developmental periods of Guyanan prehistory and in assessing settlement pat- tern changes through time. Further, investigations in lwokrama Forest and the Rupununi potentially can provide insights about transitions in food pro- curement strategies between early hunting and for- aging groups and later populations. In this context the archaeological record provides knowledge of how and to what extent these transitions are asso- ciated with long-term environmental changes within the region. In the case of Iwokrama Forest, research provides important regionally comparative data nec- essary for developing broader analyses of the prehis- tory of the Guiana Shield (cf. Vacher, Jeremie, Bri- and 1998). This paper first gives a brief overview of the his- tory of archaeological investigations in Guyana. That, in turn, provides a basis for the second and third parts of the paper, which will summarize the prehistory and archaeology of the North Rupununi and Iwokrama Forest and develop important re- search questions relating to their archaeological re- cords. These questions concern the antiquity of ear- ly human occupations, the origins and distribution of early hunting and foraging groups, and the be- ginnings of horticulture. I review major historical periods and the settlement-subsistence of the areas. Where possible, I discuss local and regional research questions and relate them to what is currently known of the archaeology of Iwokrama Forest and the Rupununi. For newer work reported here, standard archival and literature searches and field investigations that include both survey and test excavations were used. This work was conducted between 1997 and 2000. The archival and literature reviews are based upon study of archival materials in the Walter Roth Mu- seum of Anthropology, the Amerindian Research Unit, University of Guyana, as well as published and unpublished data from the region. I have also relied heavily on published and unpublished data from two field trips to Jwokrama (Plew 2002a, 2002b) and several visits to the north Rupununi (Plew &amp; Pereira 2001, Plew &amp; Saras 2001) and further un- published data (Williams 1996) from surveys within Iwokrama. Unless indicated with a supporting ref- erence, observations reported here are newly derived from recent survey work. Surveys relied upon local informants to identify known archaeological sites. They were augmented with intuitive inspection of high probability areas primarily along river corridors. An exception is the recent survey along the western flank of Jwokrama Mountain (Plew 2002a, b). Test excavations have employed standard archaeological methods. The siz- es of test units and of arbitrary excavation levels varied with setting and material densities. Methods of artifact analysis have included evaluation of tech- nical properties of ceramics including hardness and temper, assessment of manufacturing techniques and the development of lithic and ceramic typologies as the basis for regional comparisons. Chronological determinations are based on typology and upon ra- diocarbon dates for two sites near Kurupukari Falls (Williams 1996). 7</page><page sequence="2">8 M. G.

General location of the Iwokrama Reserve. Cultural Historical Background The prehistory of Guyana has three major pe- riods. The Paleo-Indian Period is the earliest and dates from at least 12,000 years ago to 7,000 B.P. or perhaps earlier. It is associated with the end of the last great Ice Age and the hunting of large an- imals such as the giant ground sloth. During this period, early peoples appear to have intruded into and through southern Guyana as they moved into northeastern Brazil. Though little is known of them, they produced well-crafted, triangular-blad- ed projectiles sometimes made from quartz. After modern environmental conditions appeared some 7,000 years ago, the second period, the Archaic Period, saw the first Meso-Indian hunter-gatherers appear on the northwest coastlands and in the Ru- pununi savannah. On the coast and around the swamps of the northwest and Pomeroon areas, nu- merous shell middens reflect the extensive use of a variety of shellfish. As a hallmark of this Archaic period, multiple resource use becomes increasingly common (Williams 1985b). It is assumed that a variety of plants were used for food and construc- tion materials. Because the Archaic period reflects considerable use of the forest, a range of new "groundstone" tools including axes, adzes and oth- er woodworking and plant processing tools, ap- pears in the archaeological record for the first time (Evans &amp; Meggers 1960). In the Rupununi area various additional resources were seasonally avail- able within microenvironments. Particularly im- portant were the seasonal fish resources of the sa- vannah. Archaic peoples also produced petroglyph- ic and pictographic rock art throughout Guyana. It appears that they also began the practice of pref- erential treatment of the dead. At the Barabina shell mound in the northwest, individuals were in- terred in flexed positions and with grave goods. In the southern savannahs, people were buried in a variety of contexts that these included burial urns and cairns. The final period in Guyanan prehistory, the Neo- Indian or Horticultural Period, was from 3500 to historic contact. Peoples in the northwest, the Pom- eroon, and in the coastal hinterland began cultivat- ing several varieties of wild manioc. Many of the best known archaeological sites in Guyana date from this period and include Barabina, Hosororo, and Mabaruma, Tiger Island and Seba. During the Hor- ticultural Period, populations became increasingly sedentary and began to produce a broad range of polychrome ceramics and griddles used in process- ing and preparing manioc.</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY OF IWOKRAMA 9 ARCHAEOLOGY IN GUYANA: AN OVERVIEW The history of archaeological research in Guyana, though brief and inconclusive, provides a chrono- logical/developmental framework for the second part of this paper, which will examine the archae- ology of Iwokrama and the North Rupununi. Schomburgk (1841), Farabee (1918, 1924) and Roth (1924) all referred to archaeological sites, par- ticularly petroglyphs, in Guyana but the pioneers of Guyanan archaeology were Brett (1868) and Im Thurn (1884). Their early excavations, including Waramuri mounds, and observations about the dis- tribution and relatedness of material cultures, mark the beginning of scientific archaeology in Guyana. Early accounts of prehistoric cultures brought sev- eral excavators to the northeast and northwest re- gions of Guyana where a number of coastal sites were investigated early in the 20th century. Many of the early accounts, (e.g., Toro 1905), report elabo- rate sites characterized by quartz utensils, pottery adornos, and burial urns, but they provide little de- scriptive context. Guyanan archaeology in the late 1 9th and early 20t1" century is generally characterized by a lack of systematic investigation, and so must be considered a period of considerable speculation. Verrill (1918) was among the first archaeologists to bring descriptive synthesis to the prehistory of Guyana. He discussed the material and geographic variability of Guyanan mounds. Defining variations in "hill top" and "shell heap" sites, he provided the first good descriptions of notable sites such as Ak- awabi, Kumaka, Koriabo and Barabina. He estimat- ed shell mass at some 5 billion shells. Furthermore, his excavations indicate the enormous dimensions of the northwest Guyanan shell mounds. Most impor- tantly, Verrill concluded that two distinct patterns existed: a lowland coastal pattern, like those in the Pomeroon region, and a second one found on in- land hilltops. His speculations regarding the origins and migrations and habits of early coastal peoples are untenable but his descriptions of site contexts and material remains are important. Equally impor- tant are his investigations of sites in the Demerara area, particularly along the Abary River (Verrill 1918). Cornelius Osgood's 1944 explorations in the northwest and Demerara regions begin the descrip- tive-historic period in Guyanan archaeology. Assert- ing an Arawak affiliation for the peoples of the northwest District, Osgood noted similarities be- tween Demerara-style potteries and the Los Barran- cos style to the west. He argued that people lived on hilltop sites rather than using them exclusively for ceremonial functions, as suggested by Verrill (1918). Osgood's (1946) investigations are the first to adequately document excavations and suggest the need for a more rigorous and systematic approach. Next, and Meggers (1960) undertook the most re- gionally comprehensive investigations to that date. Spending several months in the field in 1952, the two visited the Rupununi Savannah, the Mabaruma area in the northwest and the Abary River area. Their work led to the development of several phase chronologies, including the definition of the Ru- pununi and Taruma phases, among others, and the description of many ceramic types. After Evans &amp; Meggers (1960), little archaeolog- ical research was done in Guyana until the 1970s when Denis Williams initiated a series of studies in both the north and south of the country. The range of Williams's (1982, 1985a, 1992) work is broad, but his more important contributions include his discussion of petroglyphs associated with fisheries management (1985a) and the origins of horticulture in the Northwest of Guyana (Williams 1992), par- ticularly as related to technological change. Though his work has been largely historical, his ecological perspectives provide insights regarding the varied use of resources within the tropical environment. In spite of these innovations, the history of Guyanan archaeology is founded in the tradition of culture history. As a result, the prehistory of the region re- mains very much in a pioneering stage. Early Peopling of Guyana Pressure-flaked triangular points, endscrapers, hearths, diverse extinct and modern fauna, and pig- ments in stratigraphic relation to rock art character- ize many of the earliest assemblages. In addition, large stemmed points are associated with contexts generally dating between 15,000 and 7,000 B.P (see Meggers &amp; Miller 2003 for discussion). Further, Late Pleistocene assemblages dating between 13,500 and 11,800 B.P in Venezuela and Chile document a range of bifacially prepared projectile series in- cluding willow leaf forms similar to the El Jobo type of the Rio Pedregal sequence and contracting stemmed points commonly known as El Inga, and Pali Aike fish-tail points (see Lynch 1998). In general, considerations of early human occu- pations in South America have largely ignored Ama- zonia. This has arisen in part upon the longstanding biases of anthropologists and archaeologists regard- ing the nature of the Amazonian environment. Tra- ditionally viewed as an ecological barrier providing scarce resources (Meggers 1971), the Amazon Basin was seen as having limited the potential of aborigi- nal peoples for cultural development. Meggers's (1971) developmental model, which broadly reflect- ed the diffusionist models current in archaeology of the 1950s and 1960s, implicitly reinforced the view</page><page sequence="4">10 M. G. PLEW that there was little likelihood of discovering evi- dence of Paleoindians in the Amazon. In addition, the commonly held view that the Amazon Basin lacks the necessary lithic sources for tool production conveniently fit the debate regarding Clovis tech- nology. Despite the bias of North American archae- ologists, scholars who have recognized the richness of the Amazonian environment and the innovation of technologies adapted to the utilization of arboreal fauna have argued for a cultural pattern co-existing or coeval with the North American pattern (see Bry- an 1991). Roosevelt et al. (1996) provide convincing evi- dence of a pre-Clovis occupation from sites along the lower Amazon at Pedra Pintada near Monte Ale- gre, Brazil. Based on 56 radiocarbon dates from car- bonized plant remains and 13 thermoluminescent dates from burned lithics and sediments, they doc- ument an impressive series of occupations between 16,000 and 10,200 B.P Most importantly, the ma- jority of dates fall between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago, a period contemporary with the North Amer- ican Clovis. The occupational levels are character- ized by the following: bifacially produced quartz spear points of the type found at Lagoa Santa (Hurt 1960; see Lynch 1998 for discussion) and elsewhere in Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene contexts, other bifacial implements, pigments in stratigraphic rela- tion to cave paintings, and a wide variety of plants including fruits, berries, and palm, and faunal re- mains that include fishes, mollusks, turtles, tortoises, birds, rodents, and small and large mammals. Roosevelt et al. (1996) demonstrate that some Pa- leoindians were contemporary with North American Paleoindian cultures and that they were rock-paint- ing, river foragers of tropical forests. They provide evidence that Paleoindians were more complex, widespread, and diverse in their adaptations than formerly believed. Their work strongly implies that the North American Clovis pattern is not the sole source of migration into South America. Notably, it suggests that early human development was not lim- ited to or impeded by the tropical environment. In Guyana, little technology and no faunal re- mains have been found which suggests a megafaunal pattern (see Williams 1985b: 6). Suggestions that this pattern exists are based in part on the conven- tion that the Rupununi is a remnant of a larger Pleistocene Savannah extending along the periphery of the Amazon during glacial maxima when Ama- zonia was substantially smaller than at present (Van der Hammen &amp; Absy 1994) and that it served as a corridor through which early peoples migrated into Brazil. Williams (1985b) argues that so-called Meso- Indian or Archaic hunter-gatherers emerged on the Savannah ca. 7,500 B.P and were characterized by bifacially worked projectile points, crudely chipped stone implements, and elaborate petroglyphs. The chronology of the "Rupununi Archaic," which may be correct, is at present based on typological com- parisons with relatively older assemblages in other areas of South America. This is particularly true of many of the simple tools reported for the region. Williams (1985b) argues that an early occupation in northwest Guyana beginning around 7,000 y BP would have originated in the vicinity of the Aruku Hills and Barima River. It was distinct from the occupation of the savannahs in its emphasis upon littoral resources and in particular upon the molluscs of mangrove swamps. Its material culture is com- posed of the simplest chipped stone tools and a few simple woodworking tools adapted to forest exploi- tation. However, the Im Thurn collections (Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology, Cambridge) suggest that an early Paleoindian-like occupation may have existed in Guyana. Contained within the collections are three triangular-tanged and bifacially worked projectiles made from quartz crystals, and numerous small relatively amorphous chipped stone items that fall within the range of materials typologically char- acterized by the "Edge-Trimmed Tool Tradition" (Hurt 1977; Plew 1997). Two specimens were col- lected near the Barima River and an additional spec- imen is from the Essequibo River. In addition, Wil- liams (1985b) reports a similar projectile from near the Ireng River on the northern perimeter of the Rupununi. These projectiles are virtually identical to the Paleoindian specimens recovered by Roosevelt at Pedra Pintada on the lower Amazon, by Hurt (1960) at Lagoa Santa in Brazil, and at several other locations east of the Andes (see Lynch 1998; Simoes 1976). Williams's (1985b) description of the Archaic life- way is strikingly similar to Roosevelt's description of a "broad spectrum Archaic foraging strategy" typical of some tropical forest peoples during Paleoindian Period. In light of these recent studies, the antiquity of this pattern in Guyana may prove to be greater than thought. Hence, the discoveries at Pedra Pin- tada suggest the possibility of a more extensive use of the tropical forest of northern Guyana and of the bush forests of the Rupununi in the earlier Paleoin- dian Period. Archaic Shell Mound Pottery in Northern Guyana As it becomes clearer that early Paleo-Indians were more varied in their adaptations than previ- ously thought, so too it is obvious that later, Archaic peoples also exhibited considerable variation in their adaptive strategies. This is particularly well demon- strated by the specialized shell midden adaptation</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY OF IWOKRAMA 11 and the apparently early production of pottery. Ex- cavation of the shell mounds of northern Guyana forms the core of the archaeological investigations conducted in the country. As an early focus of ar- chaeological excavations, the mounds were generally considered to be of preceramic age. Though ceram- ics have been recovered from a number of sites in- cluding Hosororo Creek (Williams 1992), these ma- terials have been interpreted as belonging to the Alaka phase (sensu Evans &amp; Meggers 1960) and dat- ed between A.D. 1 and A.D. 500. Currently, the earliest dates for shell mounds in Guyana are un- calibrated dates of 4,115 + 50 and 5,950 + 50 BR for levels from Barabina mound (Roosevelt 1995: Table 1; 1997a). If the dates are accurate, the oc- cupations of the shell mounds predate the ceramic horizon. This is of note as Roosevelt (1995) has argued that secure radiocarbon dates from shell mounds in Amazonia establish the presence of pot- tery in the region earlier than the mounds in north- western South America from which the earliest pot- teries are believed to have derived. This assertion contrasts with Evans &amp; Meggers (1960) who felt that ceramics and agriculture were introduced to the Amazon Basin from the Andes in relatively recent prehistory. Of further importance in establishing the early presence of Archaic shell mound pottery is evidence from excavations at Hosororo Creek (Williams 1992). Hosororo Creek is described by Williams (1992) as consisting of a Mabaruma phase compo- nent stratigraphically situated above an Alaka phase Archaic pottery shell mound component (see Roo- sevelt 1997a:358). If correct, the dates at Hosororo Creek would again suggest a longer chronology for Archaic shell mounds in Guyana. Radiocarbon dates and associated cultural materials from two trenches (Cut 3 and Cut 2) indicate that the majority of pottery is from pre-4,000 B. levels (see Roosevelt 1997a:358-360 for discussion). Indeed, the greater number of sherds (373 vs. 218) was recovered be- tween 60-110 cm in Alaka Phase levels. Williams (1996) offers a "re-characterization" of the Mabaruma phase as an in situ development on the lower Aruka River associated with a Proto-Mai- puran Arawak intrusion around 1,600 B.C. He ar- gues for three periods of development, which in- clude an Early Formative culture between 1,600 B.C. and ca. A.D. 500, a Classic Mabaruma period between A.D. 500/700 and A.D., 1,000, and a Late Mabaruma period between A.D. 1,000-1,600. The Early Formative Period is characterized by broad line incising characteristic of the Incised and Modeled Traditions, whereas the Classic Mabaruma Period exhibits evidence of Barrancas Incised and Barrancas Modeled Incised. The Late Mabaruma is character- ized by the appearance and predominance of Apos- tederan ceramics, which combines elements of Ara- quinoid and Barrancoid ceramics. Williams's (1997b) recent work seems to indicate that pottery may exist earlier than the A.D. 1-A.D. 500 esti- mated by Evans &amp; Meggers (1960:334). Williams's reconfiguration of the Mabaruma phase suggests the possibility of a longer chronology of the Guyana shell mounds than has been traditionally accepted. This possibility establishes the need for additional investigation of Roosevelt's (1997a) assertion that the Guyana pottery may be older than that of the Mina phase at the mouth of the Amazon. Williams's (1996) recent reassessment of the Mabaruma phase, however, has in this context significant implications for the Pre-Formative/Formative interface and there- by for the debate with Roosevelt. Human Ecology and Horticultural Origins in Northwestern Guyana The past two decades of archaeological research in Amazonia have emphasized the nature of early human ecologies and the emergence of horticultural patterns throughout the region (e.g., Roosevelt 1991; Stahl 1994; Versteeg 1984; Williams 1992). These analyses have documented a greater complex- ity and range of human adaptations. In this regard, Williams (1985b, 1992, 1996) addressed the emer- gence of the Archaic Tradition and the beginnings of horticulture in northwest Guyana. Williams (1985b) observes the complexity of the littoral eco- system and notes a number of commensurately complex exploitive strategies. In large part these are based upon ethnographic and historic depictions of resource use for the region. Williams (1992) asserts that adaptation to a complex environment led to the development of highly specialized lithic tools that changed little over time (Williams 1985b:22). The transition from the Archaic to the pottery- producing Horticultural Period must also be docu- mented beyond the traditional presence of ceramics, grinding implements and griddle fragments. As the horticultural Mabaruma pattern in the northwest dates relatively early, evaluating the emergence of horticultural strategies that reflect the optimality of resource use by Amerindian populations is essential. Since Williams (1985b) has already demonstrated the nutritional importance of shellfish, future ques- tions may reflect why native peoples shifted their focus from the productive exploitation of such re- sources and to investment in horticulturally based economies. A further question may address one of the definitive hallmarks of the Formative period, in particular, whether pottery, occurs much earlier than its presumed appearance and not in the context of what has been believed to be a horticultural pattern. The relationship then between material cultures and</page><page sequence="6">12 M. G. PLEW subsistence strategies must be understood through multiple integrated matrices. The assertion that tools reflect the environment is convenient for the cultural historian but fails to assess the varied com- plexity of human adaptive strategies. ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE NORTH RUPUNUNI The Rupununi savannah comprises nearly half of Guyana (Williams 1979) but its archaeology (see Evans &amp; Meggers 1960, Williams 1979a, 1985b) is relatively unexplored. The archaeology of the North Rupununi is inextricably connected to the archae- ology of Iwokrama Forest because peoples of the forest and savannah moved widely in early prehis- tory maximizing their use of both environments. Developing an understanding of the range of sites and cultural materials found in the Rupununi pro- vides important comparative data necessary to assess the use of the Iwokrama Forest. Hence, review of the archaeology of the north Rupununi provides a framework for evaluating the cultural context of Jwokrama. In the context of the general questions posed in the Introduction, this evaluation addresses issues of chronology, material assemblage diversity and settlement. Paleo-Indian Period Evidence of the Paleo-Indians in the Rupununi is limited to a few discoveries including Williams's (1985b) report on a Paleo-like point from the Ireng River. Additionally, Plew (1997) identified a second triangular quartz specimen from the Im Thurn col- lections (Cat. No. Z997) that was collected on the Ireng River. An additional specimen from the Mar- iwau area in the Rupununi has been identified (Plew &amp; Saras 2001). Archaic Period Sensu Williams (1985a), Archaic artifacts include chipped and groundstone artifacts (Evans &amp; Meg- gers 1960, Roth 1924, 1929, Williams 1978); fea- tures include rock alignments (Brown 1876, Hen- derson 1952), rock circles (Brown 1873, Henderson 1952) and rock piles (Henderson 1952), grinding surfaces or depressions and sharpening grooves (pol- lisoirs) and petroglyphs. Earlier explorers in the area noted petroglyphs in the north Savannahs (see Hortsmann and Tollenaer in Harris &amp; Villiers 1911), while additional glyphs have been described by Brown (1876) on the Kwitaro. Petroglyphs have also been reported by Dubelaar &amp; Berrange (1979), Hanif (1967), Poonai (1970) and Goodland (1976) at Aishalton and at Shiriri Mountain (Plew &amp; Pe- reira 2001). The extensive studies of the rock art at Aishalton and on the Essequibo and Kassikaityu riv- ers by Williams (1979a, 1985b) lay the foundation for rock art studies in Guyana. They also are the basis for his thesis that the sign-posting of petro- glyphs served an important function in fisheries management. Williams (1985b) considers these ar- tifacts and features to date to the pre-horticultural (Archaic) period. It appears likely that many of the Archaic artifacts and features are also associated with later horticultural communities. Horticultural Period Evans &amp; Meggers (1960) identified site types and pottery forms that serve as the basis for definition of the Rupununi Phase. Two pottery types, Rupu- nuni Plain and Kanuku Plain, were described. They account for the majority of ceramics from the area. The seriation of these types suggests that Rupununi Plain becomes increasingly common over time. On the basis of associated historic items and the as- sumption that the Rupununi Phase was associated with the historic Makushi and Wapishana, Evans &amp; Meggers (1960) concluded that the phase dated from the end of the 1 8t" century. In this regard they viewed settlement of the savannah as a post-Euro- pean phenomenon (Evans &amp; Meggers 1960:326). Site types described by Evans &amp; Meggers (1960) include habitation, ceremonial, cemetery and pet- roglyph sites. Habitation sites include open villages such as Moco-Moco near Lethem and the Maubi- Wau villages to the south on the eastern Rupununi. The use of caves and rockshelters for habitation and perhaps other activities was noted at a number of sites including Wie-Wie-Tau Cave located to the south of Shiriri Mountain area. Wie-Wie-Tau rep- resents a common pattern of sparse distributions of materials consisting primarily of a few sherds and occasional animal remains. Cemetery sites are common in the Rupununi. They are either caves and rockshelters used for buri- als or ledges and walls of granite boulders upon which or adjacent to which burial urns were depos- ited. The former is well represented by Moco Moco, Bei-Tau and Tamrio-Wau shelters whereas the latter is characteristic of Upper Karakara. In the south Ru- pununi, ceremonial sites included locations adjacent to granite boulders where large shallow bowls of the Kanuku Plain type were found (Evans &amp; Meggers 1960). Ceremonial locations, which included Mar- ikanwauda and Mache-En-Tau, were not associated with other materials though a few white trade beads were found in the inside of the Marikanwauda vessel (Evans &amp; Meggers 1960). To the north in the Annai area, ceremonial sites were reported to include stone alignments of the types described by Brown (1876)</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY OF IWOKRAMA 13 and Henderson (1952). Evans &amp; Meggers (1960: 300) failed to locate alignments of this type during their survey. They note, however, that alignments were reported to them by local residents. Equally important but not recorded were petroglyphs which are well known in the vicinity of Aishalton (Wil- liams 1979). Evans &amp; Meggers (1960) described 76 chipped and groundstone artifacts defining the material cul- ture of the Rupununi Phase. Made predominately from syenite, quartzite, sandstone and felsite, these include anvils, grooved axes, choppers, hammer- stones, hoes, manos, metates, cores and flakes and two stone bowl fragments. More prominently rep- resented are pottery vessels (N = 26) and sherds (N = 8,468) of the types Kanuku and Rupununi Plain. The pottery, which is found in a variety of surface colors from orange to reddish orange to reddish brown, is made by coiling and is characterized by three forms. One form has shallow to deep bowls with outsloping to almost vertical walls, direct rims and flattened to rounded lips. A second has globular bowls and jars with walls rounded and incurving with rounded lips. The third has bowls and jars with a ridge of carination forming sharp to rounded shoulders, above which walls incurve before expand- ing to direct rims having flattened or rounded lips (Evans &amp; Meggers 1960:307-308). Kanuku Plain is distinguished from Rupununi Plain by the absence of a gray core. In addition to a few unclassified car- iape-tempered sherds, a number of unclassified dec- orated sherds were noted. Techniques include inci- sion, applique, punctate, white paint, white slip, and red film. The almost complete absence of decoration in the Rupununi Phase makes these finds particu- larly notable. Pottery artifacts included three frag- ments of a pottery rest, crude anthropomorphic fig- urine fragments, a coiled ceramic disk, nineteen shaft polishers made from both Kanuku and Ru- pununi Plain sherds and a cubical rubbing tool (Evans &amp; Meggers 1960). Plew &amp; Peirera (2001) identified four Rupununi Phase (sensu Evans &amp; Meggers 1960) sites in the Shiriri Mountain area. Though absolute dates are not available, Plew &amp; Peirera (2001) follow the pre- sumption of Evans &amp; Meggers (1960) that the Ru- pununi Phase dates to the Late Prehistoric or Early Historic period. Their survey, though limited in scope, identified a greater degree of variation in set- tlement type. They recorded a workshop/manufac- turing station, a rock alignment, red pictographic rock art and an unusual cemetery, which produced evidence of painted pottery. Evidence of manufac- ture of chipped stone tools is probably represented at sites previously described by Evans &amp; Meggers (1960). At Site IX-2:77, however, a small lithic tool manufacturing area appears to be the first such sta- tion located away from a habitation site. Discovery of a stone alignment near Lukobar Mountain broadens the range of ceremonial sites. Stone alignments are known throughout the area, having been reported by Evans et al. (1959) in east- ern Venezuela and in Amapa, northeastern Brazil (Meggers &amp; Evans 1957), the Sipaliwini and Paru savannahs of Surinam (Boomert 1975, 1977; Frikel 1961, 1969) and in granite outcrops atop the Mi- taraka Massif in French Guiana (Hurault et al. 1956). In the Rupununi, a range of alignments have been recorded by Brown (1876), Farabee (1918), Henderson (1952), Roth (1929) and Williams (1979a) . Meggers &amp; Evans (1957) note the similarity of structures from the Arua Phase in Amap'a, Brazil with those of Guyana. Suggesting movement into the mouth of the Amazon, they presumed that stone alignments were not of Rupununi Phase origin. In contrast, Boomert (1977:144-145) argues that stone alignments could have originated indepen- dently from similar socio-religious concepts. The most useful classification of regional alignments has been provided by Boomert (1981:144). He de- scribes five categories of stone alignments including rows of spaced stones, circles of spaced stones, single standing stones known as "menhirs" piles of stones, stone figures, and walls of stone. The Lukobar Mountain alignment is a single row of spaced stones and stone figures. The single row of stones is com- parable to those described by Brown (1876) east of the Ireng River and those reported by Williams (1979a) near Makatau Mountain south of Aishal- ton. Williams reported linear rows of spaced stones measuring 106 and 75 meters in length. The larger was 750 quartz cobbles and the smaller was 122 granite cobbles. The larger alignment situated on a small hillock to the east of Makatau Mountain ends in a short fork enclosed on its third side to form a triangle. The Lukobar alignment (48 meters) is smaller than those reported by Williams (1 979a) but like the larger of the Makatau alignments is config- ured into circular and rectangular forms constituting part of the same alignment. The function of the alignments remains speculative though the locations and the material associations would seem to support the ceremonial/ritual function ascribed to them by Evans &amp; Meggers (1960). Roth (1929) reports that the alignments served as a reminder of the numbers of individuals slain in battle, a report reiterated to us by Wapishana informants. Roth (1929) also ob- served that alignments may have served as "signs or signals on the road." Regardless of function, Ru- pununi Plain sherds recovered from the Lukobar lo- cality indicate that stone alignments of the types</page><page sequence="8">14 M. G. PLEW described by Boomert (1981) are associated with the Rupununi Phase. Recent work also recorded an important cemetery on Shiriri Mountain. This indicates variability in mortuary practice. Evans &amp; Meggers (1960) note the use of ledges and walls of granite boulders for placement of burial jars. They are typically few in number, occasionally isolated, and in some instances accompanied by large vessels of the Kanuku Plain type. They are inverted relative to burial jars and so serve as lids. Though the vessel types reported by Evans &amp; Meggers (1960) are relatively similar to the range of vessels present at the Shiriri Mountain cem- etery, Shiriri appears to represent a funerary context used many times over an extended period. The Shi- riri cemetery consists of vessels with constricted necks but of variable sizes. There is no evidence of the use of open vessels to serve as lids. In contrast, small ceramic disks measuring 4-6 cm in diameter served as lids fastened or sealed over the lip of the vessel by small daubs of yellowish clay approximate- ly 1-1.5 cm in diameter. While Evans &amp; Meggers (1960:295) report that the only cremated remains from the Rupununi Phase were found in a single vessel from Tamiro-Wau cemetery, it appears that all vessels at Shiriri contained cremated remains. Hence, the Shiriri cemetery is distinct with respect to context, sealing of vessels and in the common practice of cremation, a form of disposal not prac- ticed by the historic Wapishana. It appears that the remains had been exposed to high temperatures with only distal ends of upper and lower limb bones pres- ent. Several individuals are represented. One small vessel appears to contain the remains of an infant. In addition, the face of the rockshelter is covered by red pictographs. These include a geometric con- figuration of connected rectangles and a series of dot and line patterns. The geometric motif is located just above the stone platform at the base of the shel- ter where the vessels were placed. Above the rect- angles is a series of fine red lines in lateral groupings. To the east a group of lines and dots were found in variable configurations. Lines are often situated one above another. Four ceramic vessels were recovered from the cemetery. These include four small glob- ular vessels. Surface and core color indicate that three of the vessels are of the Rupununi Plain type and one is a Kanuku Plain vessel. The Shiriri cemetery is of still further interest be- cause it is associated with pictographic rock art. This is of particular note since pictographic rock art has not been reported in the Rupununi and consists of motifs not common in petroglyphic panels of Aish- alton (Williams 1979a) and of the Essequibo and Kassikaityu Rivers (Williams 1979b and 1985b). The exceptions are Brown's (1876) and Baldwin's (1846) passing references to painted figures. The Shiriri cemetery pictographs consist of red painted lines and dots which appear to be grouped together and also of a fairly large panel of connected dia- mond motifs just above the floor of the shelter. Di- amond motifs of this type are not common in the area. Though Williams (1979a: 22-24) describes two small isolated motifs at Makatau Cave to the south, the motif is clearly insignificant in its pres- ence in the Aishalton style. The presence of picto- graphic figures at the Shiriri cemetery is of note be- cause it implies that red pictographic art may be associated with certain burial contexts in late hori- zons. Of further significance is the possibility that the red painted vessel from Shiriri reflects additional as- pects of Rupununi ritual. Williams (2004) has de- scribed a Classic period Mabaruma hands-to-face fu- nerary motif similar to that recovered at Shiriri Mountain and common throughout portions of Amazonia. The figurine, which was recovered from Mon Repos, a Post Classic cemetery of the Abary phase and from Kumuku Hill in an Apostederan assemblage on the Demerara coast, is distinctive in the wavy locks motif placed on the back of the neck as a directional device in mortuary ritual (Williams 2004:301). The presence of the motif in the Ru- pununi suggests that a broad pattern of mortuary symbolism was shared by many peoples over a large area for an extended period. In general, Plew &amp; Pereira (2001) confirmed ear- lier observations by Evans &amp; Meggers (1960) and Williams (1979a) regarding the distribution of cul- tural materials and site types. The survey suggests, however, greater variability in site types as indicated by the discovery of a lithic workshop station, the Lukobar Mountain stone alignment, and by the Shi- riri Mountain cemetery. This suggests a more elab- orate set of ritual and mortuary practices. Whereas recovery of red painted pottery, the description of pictographic rock art, and association of a stone alignment complex with the Rupununi Phase are of specific historical interest, much additional work is required before a complete understanding of the use of the south savannahs and of the Rupununi Phase is possible. Although previous research shows the wealth and variability of archeological resources within the re- gion of the south Savannahs, it is unclear whether patterns described by Evans &amp; Meggers (1960), Williams (1979a) and Plew &amp; Pereira (2001, 2002) are consistent throughout the area or whether a greater variability in of hunter-gatherers lifeways is to be found (see Williams 1985b). Reconnaissance of areas along the western flank of the Kanuku Mountains in the vicinity of Moco- Moco village and the Sawariwau River near Impren- za recorded several archaeological sites (Plew, Mercer</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY OF IWOKRAMA 15 and Sundell 2001). These include a lithic workshop/ manufacturing station, groundstone features, burial localities and a probable 1 9th century village site containing Rupununi Plain pottery. The ground- stone features include grinding/processing areas and sharpening grooves. Four types of groundstone features were noted at two sites along the Sawariwau River near Imprenza. Type 1 features include shallow circular to oval ba- sins measuring 15-30 cm in diameter while Type 2 includes elongated features having widths of 8-9 cm and lengths between 18 and 20 cm. Type 3 features consist of narrow elongates measuring ca. 20 cm in length, 3-4 cm in width and 2 cm in depth. Type 4 features include large shallow trough-like features set end-to-end and measuring 20 by 30 cm. Over sixty individual features were noted. Groundstone features have not been routinely described in the Rupununi, making the Sawariwau finds relatively unique. The presence of these features at differing depths in the river channel suggests a pattern similar to that descibed by Williams (1979a) in which fish petrogylphs were positioned to coincide with vari- able water levels. East of Moco-Moco is what appears as an aban- doned village site covering an area of 100 X 60 meters. Though no evidence was found of house floors or remnants, fragments of wattle and daub and brick were noted. Two archaeological features that were documented consisted of an apparent hearth and refuse dump and a possible stone-lined cooking feature, which includes the remains of a pottery vessel. The site contains historic bottle glass, metal fragments, and both plain and decorated por- celain of types similar to those described by Evans &amp; Meggers (1960) and considered to date to the early 1 9th century. Most notably, twenty sherds of the type Rupununi Plain were recovered at the lo- cation. This supports Evans &amp; Meggers's (1960) as- sertion that the Rupununi Phase extended into the Historic period. In addition to recording a significant number of groundstone features and an important 19th century village site, the survey identified a burial locality un- like those previously described by Evans &amp; Meggers (1960) and by Plew &amp; Pereira (2001). Situated north of Moco-Moco are two large boulder shelters. Along the south edge of the more northern boulder is a cairn burial. The burial contains the remains of a robust male placed on a stone slab and covered by stones to a height of some seventy centimeters. Ka- nuku Plain pottery sherds are scattered about the burial area and the slope of the Rockshelter. The findings of the west Kanuku survey reaffirm what is currently known of the prehistory of the Rupununi but suggests that the record is consider- ably more varied than previously known. Discovery of new site types will allow assessment of the greater variability of the Rupununi Phase identification, but evaluation and dating of additional habitation sites would permit a more compete understanding of the Rupununi Phase peoples in the early historic period. Archaeological sites have also been identified in the vicinity of Shulinab and Mariwau Villages and near Inaja south of Lethem. The two sites near Inaja are typical ceramic scatters covering relatively small areas. They consist of a few scattered sherds. In both instances, the ceramics belong to the type Kanuku Plain. The sites appear to reflect short term uses of the area. In the mountains east of Shulinab Village, the survey located a rock alignment complex. It con- sisted of stacked stones, cairns, and a rectangular feature resembling the range of features described by Evans &amp; Meggers (1957) in the Amapa region of Brazil and the Paruf savannahs of Suriname (Boomert 1975, 1977). The alignment, however, most closely resembles that described by Williams (1979a) at Makatau Mountain and by Plew &amp; Pe- reira (2001) at Lukobar Mountain near Shiriri. Of still greater interest is the discovery of distinct cem- etery locations on Skull Mountain near Shulinab and in the mountains east of Mariwau. The Skull Mountain cemetery is located in a rockshelter below the rock alignment/"war-bench," described above. The shelter rises some twenty meters above its floor and measures approximately 35 X 8 X 12 meters. Situated near the center of the rockshelter are nine- teen ceramic vessels. The largest, which measures 70 cm in diameter, contains the remains of three males probably in their 20s at the time of death. A female mandible was situated under ceramic sherds near the back of the shelter. Vessels vary greatly in size and all but two are Kanuku Plain. The remaining vessels, which are quite large, are of the type Rupununi Plain. All are round-bottomed and do not appear to have been sealed. In this regard the ceramic vessels associated with the interments are similar to those associated with the cairn burial near Moco-Moco- Creek. The majority of vessels were open-mouthed but a few of the smaller ones possessed incurved necks. This is of note since many of the vessels at Shiriri were sealed with clay lids, though all were constricted-necked vessels. Of equal interest is the presence of pictographic rock art in the form of par- allel smudges, lines, dissected circles, a U-shaped configuration and opposed rectangles. Notably, the Shiriri cemetery is the only other site that has pic- tographic representation in association with a burial context (Plew &amp; Pereira 2001). An additionally important discovery was made in mountains near Mariwau Village where burial urns were recessed into pits excavated into an open saddle some 200 meters above the savannah floor. Though</page><page sequence="10">16 M. G. PLEW two of the features had been looted, the third re- mained intact. Two vessels of the type Kanuku Plain were superimposed and stabilized by stones placed around the base of the upper vessel. To date, this is the first recording of this type of burial in the Ru- pununi. Recent work in the vicinity of Yupukari and Toka villages has also cast light on the nature of Rupu- nuni occupations (Plew &amp; Pereira 2002). In and around the village of I'oka, pollisoirs similar to those at Imprenza on the Sauriwau River were noted as was a mountaintop village with cooking areas and a range of decorated and painted ceramics. In addi- tion, a new type of cemetery characterized by earth- en and stone mounds was recorded. So too were petroglyphs of the Enumerative style on Banuni Creek south of Toka (Plew &amp; Pereira 2002). The investigations reported here suggest a gen- erally greater variability in site types than previously known (cf. Evans &amp; Meggers 1960; Plew &amp; Pereira 2001; Plew, Mercer and Sundell 2001). First, the results suggest that open ceramic scatters/sites may be expected to occur in locations other than adja- cent to major water sources as is the case with the recently recorded mountaintop village near Toka. Secondly, there appears to be a common pattern of stone alignment construction in site areas locally known as "war-benches," and thirdly, pictographic rock art is associated with some burial localities but not all. The findings further suggest that burials are not gender-specific, that they are sometimes situated in open areas, and that they are again varied, as is demonstrated by the superimposition of burial urns at some sites. Though Evans &amp; Meggers (1960) de- scribed vessels recessed into rockshelter floors, the discoveries at Mariwau appear to be the first in which vessels were placed in an open area. Recent investigations within the North Rupununi area are important in interpreting the archaeology of the Iwokrama reserve. Since Amerindian peoples have utilized both areas, though variously over time, an understanding of the archaeology of the Rupu- nuni is essential to delineating the parameters of prehistoric cultural uses of the forest. Conversely, the archaeology of Iwokrama should provide in- sights into uses of the north Rupununi area in ear- lier prehistoric times. Specifically, the relationship between the North Rupununi and Iwokrama Forest should provide insights into the methods and sea- sonality of resource use, the potential optimality of different resources and strategies, and the relative importance of hunting and gathering to horticulture as well as the seasonal versus annual importance of fishing to hunting and horticulture. In addition, ex- amining the relationships between the areas should allow for a better understanding of tool stone ac- quisition and distribution, as well as of the manu- facture of lithic and ceramic items and their distri- bution within the region. Also, further investigation should enhance our knowledge of the ritual and re- ligious sites in the area. ARCHAEOLOGY OF IWOKRAMA FOREST The archaeology of Iwokrama provides important data for interpreting forest adaptations in Guyana and the surrounding areas as well as the simulta- neous use of the forest and savannah as part of a broader settlement regime. The following overview of Iwokrama archaeology is based on surveys and test excavations of Williams (1996) and Plew (2002). Williams (1996) participated in two short ex- ploratory surveys in May 1993. These served as the basis for his more formal survey of the Iwokrama Forest between 2-31 March, 1994. Relying upon work conducted by Meggers &amp; Evans (1960) in the Pakaraimas and his work on the Mazaruni, Potaro, and Essequibo Rivers (Williams undated a-c.), he sought to predict the nature of archaeological sites and occupations within the reserve. His effort was maximized by conducting linear surveys of streams and rivers. Williams (1996) analyzed the data from these surveys within a cultural-historical framework that included consideration of the Paleo-Indian, Ar- chaic, Horticultural, and the Historic Period. He also evaluated the nature of occupations of the Re- serve with respect to the so-called "refuge theory" positing Holocene Period fluctuations in climate that reflect expanding and coalescing conditions of wetness and aridity. In particular, Williams (1978) contends that archaeological evidence from Seba on the coast and Quartz Island in the rain forest near the Mazaruni River documents these fluctuations. Williams (1979b, 1985a) further argues a fisheries management strategy identified the use of differing technologies and species at different seasons and lo- cations along watercourses within the Reserve. Wil- liams (1996) also argued for a relationship between forest peoples and those utilizing the savannah as part of a broader regional settlement. More recently, Plew (2002) has conducted surveys and test exca- vations in the Iwokrama Mountains and along the Essequibo River near the field station. These pro- jects suggests some greater settlement variation than posited by Williams (1996). Paleo-Indian Period The Paleo-Indian Period from 11,500 to 7,000 B.P, is not currently documented within the Re- serve. Neither Williams (1996) nor Plew (2002) identify relevant materials or sites. If, as Williams (1985b) suggests, the economic pursuits of Paleo-</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY OF IWOKRAMA 17 Indians are associated with a "Big-Game" orienta- tion characteristic of more open parklands/savannah country, evidence within the Reserve may be limit- ed. If there occurred extended periods of drought during late Pleistocene or Early Holocene, evidence may exist in some locations. The absence of data may also reflect the level of archaeological sampling within the reserve and in Guyana generally. Since the 1950s, finds of Paleo-Indian triangular and triangular-stemmed points made of quartz crys- tal and other materials have become increasingly common. Noted early by Hurt (1960) at Lagoa San- ta in Brazil the distribution of such points has re- cently been summarized by Meggers &amp; Miller (2003). In Guyana, Williams (1985b) reports on a Paleo-like point from the Ireng River. Additionally, Plew (1997) identified three triangular quartz spec- imens in the Im Thurn collections (Cambridge Uni- versity), one from near the Barima River, one from on the Ireng, and a third from the Essequibo. A fourth specimen, from the Mariwau area in the Ru- pununi, has been identified (Plew &amp; Saras 2001). Archaic Period The Archaic Period from 7,000 to 3500 y BP is characterized by a pattern of broad spectrum for- aging associated with a wide range of archaeological site types. These include artificial groundstone de- pressions, chipping stations/manufacturing loca- tions, petroglyphs, and isolated artifacts. Because the Archaic economic strategy reflects considerable use of the forest, a range of new "groundstone" tools including axes, adzes and other woodworking and plant processing tools first appear in the archaeolog- ical record. Some items are associated with the man- ufacture and use of artificial depressions (open ba- sins) used for plant processing and for sharpening grooves. Petroglyphs include stylistic elements character- istic of the Enumerative and Fish-Trap petroglyph styles that Williams (1985a) believes to be associated with different time periods, different cultural tradi- tions and different subsistence strategies. Absent are design motifs characteristic of the Timehri picto- graphic style. The Enumerative style is considered the oldest and includes geometric, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic elements while the Fish-Trap style glyphs were "sign-posted" on rocks identifying dif- ferent species and seasonal locations. The later style is thought by Williams (1985a) to be associated with periods of reduced precipitation during the late Holocene. Most notable is the reporting by Wil- liams (1996) of what he describes as the first oc- currence of the so-called Cuneiform glyph in Guy- ana. The glyph is a sub-variant of the Enumerative style and is found mainly on the Siparuni River. Specifically, it is an inscription technique in which a narrow "v"-shaped groove is cut into the stone in the manufacture of the glyph. As such it represents more the method of manufacture than a petroglyph- ic style. The Enumerative style, which is most com- monly represented in the rock art of Iwokrama, is found on the Essequibo to Waraputa Falls, and on the Buro-Buro to Dakali Falls. The presence of the Fish-Trap style is known from an occurrence of the "spring-basket trap" glyph at Kurupukari on the Es- sequibo. As noted, glyphs of the Fish-Trap style are thought to be associated with different water levels, e.g., those at Inscription Rock on the Buro-Buro River. At Sharples, Williams's (1996) reports a unique and as yet unreported style described as in- cluding an "integrated lozenge." Enumerative, Cuneiform and Fish-Trap styles of rock art reflect varying functions but it is unclear whether they represent different cultural traditions (ethnic populations) and/or different time periods in the Reserve. This is because most rock art re- mains undateable. Further, while Williams's (1985a) hypothesis regarding fisheries management has great interpretive value, it is not yet possible to distinguish between the placements of artificial depressions in- tended to ensure continued use at differing seasonal water levels on one hand from those during periods of extended Holocene drought on the other (see Ta- ble 1). Groundstone Features (Artificial Depressions and Sharpening Grooves).- A notable category of archae- ological sites within the Jwokrama Forest is ground- stone features that occur in numerous locations along major rivers. The features include shallow ba- sin depressions used for processing plants, most commonly those used for fish poisons, and steeply incised grooves believed to be used as sharpening grooves for axes, adzes, and other woodworking im- plements. The features which Williams (1985b) re- ferred to as "pollisoirs" have not been systematically recorded in many areas. These occur in a variety of forms and often with shallow basin depressions. Williams (1996) reported groundstone features on the Siparuni, Buro-Buro and Essequibo rivers. Of these, the most diverse and extensive occur on the Siparuni where six sites document 926 ground- stone features. Features include both open dish-like depressions and "sharpening" grooves. Though fea- tures are noted at Electric Eel Rock (N = 34) Tapir Rock (34), Trinity Rock (3) and Pakatau Falls (3), 92% of all features occur at Big "S" Falls (see Fig. 2). Williams (1996) notes an approximately equal distribution of features by left (N = 414) and right (434) riverbanks and observes that sharpening grooves, which are not common, also exhibit a rel- atively equal distribution between riverbanks. On the Buro-Buro River, 37 depressions were noted of</page><page sequence="12">18 M. G. PLEW Table 1. lwokrama petroglyph sites.

Notably, very few sharpening grooves were found. The num- ber of depressions reported on the Essequibo River also varied greatly. At Kurupukari Falls, 25 were not- ed whereas 33 were observed at Sharples. The most extensive features occurred at Cuneiform Rock where 136 were noted but in general there were few sharpening grooves (see Table 2). Williams (1996) does not develop a formal ty- pology of groundstone depressions though he de- scribes three types: circular to ovoid depressions, el- lipsoids resulting from longitudinal grinding of pre- forms into specific tools/implements, and ellipsoids from sharpening the edges of cutting tools. He as- sumes that size grades in the latter reflect the use of different grooves to sharpen different types of tools. Plew et al. (2001) developed a typology of ground- stone features based on findings on the Sauriwau River in the Rupununi. This seems to describe the range of variability in features within Iwokrama. Plew et al. (2001:9) describe four types of ground- stone features based on form, size and spatial align- ment of features. Type 1 features are shallow (1-2 cm) circular to oval basins between 15-30 cm in diameter. Type 2 are elongated features between 8 and 9 cm in width and 18-20 cm in length with average depths of 4 centimeters. Type 3 are narrow, elongated features averaging 20 cm in length, 3-4 cm in width and 2 cm in depth. Type 3 features often occur in rows whereas Type 4 includes large shallow trough-basin features set end-to-end in rows. The majority of the features recorded by Wil- liams (1996) appear to fall within the range of var- iation of Type 1 and the few sharpening grooves reported fit Type 2 (Table 3). Lithic Chipping/Manufacturing Station.-On the left bank of the Buro-Buro River at Inscription Rock is an area of extensive quartz outcroppings. Williams (1996) reports thousands of lithic flakes and artifacts there. These include two bifacially worked axes (12 X 6 X 3 cm and 9.5 X 10 X 3.5 cm) and two large plano-convex choppers notable in that very few lithic quarries and/or workshops have been re- corded within the area. Iwokrama Mountains. Plew (2002) identified evidence of Archaic occupations/use of areas beyond the major rivers. This is important because it sug- gests that the Archaic settlement pattern is one in which prehistoric peoples visited and used areas/re- sources throughout the region. This contrasts with the pattern suggested by Williams (1996). Plew's (2002a) survey strategy was largely intuitive in using landscape features as the basis for a priori assign- ment of probability of site location. Specifically, the strategy involved gradual ascent of a mountain from a base camp established two miles east of the Georgetown-Lethem road along an unnamed stream, with descent along its western face. The sur- vey identified landscape features including streams, seeps, boulders along streams, rock outcrops, stone piles and large rock boulders near summits as likely locations of archaeological sites. As in Williams (1996), identification of these features was based upon Meggers &amp; Evans (1960), Williams (2004)</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY OF IWOKRAMA 19 IWOKRAMA RESERVE 10 0 10 20 Kilometers _/ !.y t ;.~&gt;~ | l-, - /=&gt;&lt; r4)' (l?

The survey identified two archaeological sites. They are petroglyph sites on secondary and tertiary stream courses. The petroglyphic elements generally resemble the Enumerative Petroglyph Tradition el- ements reported elsewhere in the Reserve. One site is located on a small intermittent stream no more than three meters across with many granite boul- ders. Like most of the area, the granite is covered by a dark magnesium oxide. Two generally bi-cen- tric circles are depicted on a west-facing boulder measuring roughly one meter in diameter. The ele- ments measure 40 x29 cm and 23 X 20 X 39 cm.</page><page sequence="14">20 M.

The gravures are approximately 3 cm wide and 1-2 cm deep. The second set of elements was noted along a 15 m wide stream approximately one kilometer east of the first locality and 200 m north of the base camp. Its elements consist of straight lines, curvilin- ear elements and a completely pecked, heart-shaped design. One element appears to represent a serpent. The elements are on flat boulders along the stream course and are located along a rock face three meters in length, in what are essentially two panels. The larger covers about 50 X 30 cm. A single curvilinear motif measures 25 X 36 cm. The gravures are roughly 2-3 cm wide and 1-2 cm deep. In one instance, the edges of the boulders forming angles have been pecked to smooth surfaces. All motifs ap- peared above the present high water line. The findings of the recent survey are significant because they indicate the presence of Amerindians in areas beyond the major rivers. Discovery of pet- roglyphs on secondary and tertiary streams impor- tantly indicates that prehistoric Amerindians, who inhabited and utilized the major rivers, also made use of forest interiors. Also, it shows that these areas were not exclusively associated with subsistence. Of further significance is the identification of numerous locations on the mountain that could have served as short-term habitation sites and as cemetery or burial localities. The area inspected, though small relative to the total area of the Jwokrama Moun- tains, was characterized by rock outcrops and boul- der shelters, which are known to have been utilized by Amerindians. Team informants reported areas within Jwokrama Forest very similar to locations around Toka to the south where recent discoveries of the pattern have been made (Plew &amp; Pereira 2002). Also notable is the discovery of rock art in settings above present water levels. This raises ques- tions regarding Williams's (1996) argument that desiccation of the forest occurred periodically during the Holocene. Horticultural Period Between 3,500 B.P and the Historic Period (early to mid- I 8th century) occupation in Jwokrama is documented by seven archaeological sites with pot- tery. Though pottery is known to date from earlier Archaic contexts in some areas of Amazonia (see Roosevelt 1998), its occurrence in Guyana has tra- ditionally been associated with early horticulturalists (see, e.g., Williams 1985b, 1996).

Test excava- tions have been conducted at four locations on the Essequibo, near Kurupukari Falls at Errol's Landing and on Alexis Marcel's Island as well as at Makari Falls (Williams 1996) and at the Reserve Base Camp (Field Station) by Plew (2002). Essequibo River: Errols Landing-.Most notable and relevant to the Horticultural horizons in the Reserve are excavations conducted by Williams (1996) at Errol's Landing. Just above Kurupukari Falls on a river terrace some three meters above low water levels, Williams (1996) excavated a 2 X 2 m test unit to a depth of 80 cm. Excavated in 15 cm levels, the 0-15 cm interval consisted of terre preta soil with rootlets, charcoal, potsherds (n = 314) and lithic detritus. The 15-30 cm interval was similar but had more pebbles and less charcoal. Eight hun- dred and two pottery sherds were found throughout the interval. The 30-45 cm interval had a still great- er density of pebbles but fewer of potsherds (n = 390). An area of intense burning yielded a charcoal sample. The 45-60 cm interval saw no change in soil type but an increase in pebble size and density. The density was such that the excavation unit was cut to a 1 X 2 m unit. The sherd count was 112. The 60-80 cm interval was excavated within a 1 X 1 m unit to accommodate the difficulty of excavat- ing through large cobbles. Only nine sherds were recovered and the excavation curtailed at 80 cm due to the presence of large rocks. Errol's Landing produced the most significant ce- ramic inventory from the Reserve as well as a stone tool assemblage. This included a whetstone 6.5 cm in diameter, a hammerstone ca. 7 cm in diameter, a scraper/knife between 6-8 cm made from a lithic flake, a chopper measuring ca. 8 cm in diameter, and a projectile point approximately 7 cm long made from a flake. Radiocarbon dates of 2080 + 70 B.P. (Beta-76246 (Williams 1996) for the 45- 60 cm level and of 2910 ? 80 B.P. (Beta-76247, Williams 1996) date the lower levels of the site to the early Horticultural Period (Table 4). The Errol's Landing ceramic inventory consisted of 1627 sherds of which only 99 were decorated (Williams 1996). Pottery was manufactured using a coiling technique and temper that consisted of quartz sand, decomposed granite and caraipe. Unox- idized and oxidized sherds were found. Colors ranged from gray-black through tan to brick-orange. Tempering agents appeared to be associated with varying degrees of oxidation. Most granite-tempered specimens were fully oxidized. Core color varies, with pottery being relatively hard, well-smoothed and occasionally burnished (Williams 1996). Paint- ed pottery is generally red-on-white. Incision was stained with red pigment. There were seven undec- orated vessel forms that include open and carinated bowls and globular jars and bottles. Mouth diame- ters range between 12-40 cm with vessel wall thick- nesses between 4-9 cm. Walls are vertical, incurring and out-sloping with direct rims and lips which are commonly tapered, beveled and thickened. In gen- eral, plain vessel forms resemble those of the Taruma Phase (Evans &amp; Meggers 1960, see Figs. 1 and 2; Fig. 3). Decorated ceramics from Errol's Landing include a range of vessel forms and decoration techniques. These include painting, modeling, incising, brush- ing, scraping, stamping and fingertip impressions. Ten types described by Williams (1996) include open bowls with direct rims painted red-on-white or incised on exterior surfaces; open bowls with a wide range of flanged rims in excess of 20 mm with incised motifs which include broad line "U" section incisions parallel to the rim and accented by spiral, circular and semi-circular motifs, open bowls with thickened rims measuring between 6-17 mm with interior and exterior incisions; bowls with incurvate walls, flat bases and zoomorphic lugs; flat-based small mouthed (up to 12 cm) pans with everted lobed rims decorated with a red wash and paired incisions including vertical semicircles bounded by incised horizontals; deep bowls/jars with vertical ves- sel walls and thickened rims having mouth diame- ters between 22-36 cm and wall thicknesses be- tween 7-8 mm with "U"-sectioned incisions placed on rim surfaces as are fingertip impressions; deep bowls with curving to angular shoulders with evert- ed rims and straight vessel walls with "U" sectioned incisions and paired semicircles are common as are bottles or jars with collared necks and flattened bases having mouth diameters of 6-12 cm, strap handles and punctated nubbins over a white slip applied to both interior and exterior surfaces and wall thick- nesses averaging 6.5 mm; globular jars with walls</page><page sequence="16">22 M.

The lid is thin jar lid decorated with surface punctuations. In general types resemble those de- scribed by Evans &amp; Meggers (1960, Table 5, see Fig. 4). Essequibo River: Alexis Marcel&amp; Island.-This area is immediately east of Sharples Island near Kuru- pukari Falls and produced 65 pottery sherds (Wil- liams 1996). Excavation of a 2 X 2 m test unit using 20 cm arbitrary excavation levels produced an assemblage of both ceramics and stone tools. The 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm levels of white sand con- taining charcoal were interspersed with historic ma- terials in the uppermost horizons. The 40-60 cm interval consisted of white sand that rapidly stained bright orange contained more clay and was increas- ingly more compact in the lowest levels of the unit. No cultural material was found in the interval. The unit floor was probed to a level of 80 cm below datum and produced no cultural materials (Williams 1996). The material culture included stone tools and de- bris and pottery. One chipped and one ground stone axe were recovered as were lithic flakes of jasper, which occurs in the Pakaraimas. Undecorated vessels included open bowls with direct rims and tapered, rounded and thickened lips; deep bowls with verti- cal incurvate walls and direct rims with tapered, rounded or beveled lips; and carinated bowls with excurvate upper walls and direct rims with tapered, beveled or thickened lips. Vessels generally resemble those at Errol's Landing though none has a red Table 5. Kurupukari Falls. Sherd frequencies/level (from Williams 1996).

Decorated ceramics include a globular jar with incurvate walls, constricted mouth and direct rim with rounded lip. Decoration includes the rem- nants of a red wash or slip and the latticework of lozenge-shaped units set above the shoulder of the vessel. The latter is 10-20 mm in maximum di- ameter (Williams 1996). Williams (1996) does not provide level totals for sherds recovered though it appears that the assemblage was not large. Essequibo River: Reserve Base Camp (Field Sta- tion).-Williams (1996) recorded 30 sherds from a relatively restricted area south of the administrative/ kitchen area and roughly 300 m south of the Es- sequibo River. Plain sherds in the collection are from carinated bowls with incurvate upper walls, direct rims and tapered, beveled or thickened lips. Temper consists of crushed decayed granite. The decorated sherds include one well-smoothed, red painted sherd and a second with "U"-sectioned in- cisions 8 mm wide. These circle the rim contour. Plew (2002) found in the area three plain beige- orange sherds ca. 7 cm long and approximately 4 cm wide. They were smoothed and resembled the type Rupununi Plain. Two 1 X 1 m test units were excavated approximately three meters west of the field station boat dock. The units were aligned to magnetic north and excavated in 10 cm levels to an approximate depth of 25 cm below datum. The units were subsequently probed to a depth of ca. 40 cm. with no noticeable change in the nature of the deposit or densities of cultural material. The deposit consisted of white sand containing rootlets, some charcoal, and historic artifacts including wood, nails, glass and some metal fragments. Unit 3-4W/0-1N contained at the 10 cm interval two plain sherds resembling the type Rupununi Plain. Essequibo River: Makari Falls.-Located approxi- mately 3.5 m above high water level on a small mound directly behind the river bank at Makari Falls is a small area of terre preta (Williams 1996). Williams excavated a 2 X 2 m test pit to a depth of 20 cm. His excavation revealed an almost contin- uous bed of charcoal. Unfortunately, no artifactual materials were recovered. While Williams (1996) as- serts that the site may have been used as a prehis- toric fishing camp, it is unclear whether the site dates within the Horticultural Period since a single radiocarbon date was assessed at 90 ? 50 B.P. (Beta- 76249, Williams 1996). Essequibo River: David Andries Landing.-Wil- liams (1996) collected 24 sherds eroding from the plaza area of a multi-household compound approx- imately 30 m above Kurupukari on the left bank of the Essequibo. The sample contained 15 cariape- tempered and nine sand-tempered sherds. Sherds re- semble plain types of the Koriabo and Rupununi Phases. Essequibo River: Martin's Island.-Williams (1996) reports two small petaloid axes, a fragment of a large Dutch jar and two sand and cariape sherds of an undescribed type all excavated on the right bank of the Essequibo opposite Kurupukari Land- ing. Essequibo River: Kurupukari Falls.-A single unique ceramic vessel was recovered in a crevice within the Kurupukari Falls (Williams 1996). The sherds are from a large globular jar with collared neck and exteriorly thickened rim. The mouth of the vessel would have been approximately 32 cm wide and its wall thicknesses would have been 10 mm. Tempered with quartz sand, the specimen is unique among others recovered at Errol's Landing and Alexis Marcel's Island (Williams 1996). Siparuni River: Big "S" Falls.-Williams (1996) excavated a habitation area immediately below Big S Falls on the right bank of the Siparuni River. A series of shovel probes and excavation of a 2 X 2 m test pit recovered 552 sherds from the 15 cm intervals. The 0-15 cm interval contained a dense</page><page sequence="18">24 M. G. PLEW layer of humus above silty yellowish soil but no cul- tural material. The 15-30 cm interval had more compacted silty yellowish soil with charcoal frag- ments and pottery sherds. The 30-45 cm interval saw a gradual change in soil color from yellowish to pale orange with greater soil compaction and less cultural material. Lithic flakes were noted through- out the deposit. Of the 552 sherds, only 46 were decorated (Wil- liams 1996). Tempering agents for both decorated and undecorated ceramics included quartz sand, crushed decomposed granite, and caraipe. Most sherd cores are dark tan in color with a range of hardness. Decoration included a rare use of red and white slips, incision, stamping, fingernail impres- sion, modeling and unerased coils. There was no evidence of painted designs. Seven vessel shapes were recorded. These include open bowls with direct rims and tapered, rounded or beveled lips with mouth diameters of 12-40 cm and vessel wall thickness ranging between 4-8 mm; bowls or jars with incurvate walls and constricted mouths with direct rims and tapered, rounded or beveled lips; mouth diameters of 16-24 cm and wall thicknesses of between 3.5 and 6 mm; bowls with constricted necks and wide, flaring rims with round- ed, tapered or beveled lips having mouth diameters extending to 36 cm and vessel wall thicknesses be- tween 5-6.5 mm; globular jars with constricted necks and wide everted rims with rounded or ta- pered lips and mouth diameters extending to a max- imum of 60 cm while vessel walls range between 6- 16 mm; globular jar or bottle with vertical or slight- ly incurvate collared neck having mouth diameter of 6 cm; bowl with constricted mouth and exteriorly thickened rim with mouth diameter of 12 cm and a vessel wall thickness of 5 mm; and a colander having perforations measuring 20-25 mm in di- ameter and set 12-25 mm apart. The decorated ce- ramics from Big "S" Falls include four types that in form resemble undecorated varieties: open bowls with direct or thickened rims which are painted red- on-white; deep bowls with vertical to incurvate walls with overlapping unerased coils 6-8 mm wide; a carinated bowl with incurvate collar and flanged rim decorated with a stamped lattice of lozenge-shaped motifs measuring up to 20 mm in diameter; and a jar lid having unerased coils and "U"-sectioned el- ements below rim exteriors. In general, the types represented are similar in form, style, and decoration to Taruma, Koriabo and Rupununi phase materials (see Evans &amp; Meggers 1960, Figs. 89, 95; Plew &amp; Peirera 2002; Williams 1996, 2004). CONCLUSIONS The record reviewed here is the basis for conclu- sions regarding the archaeology of Iwokrama and the North Rupununi. The questions addressed here relate to the chronology of these areas and the na- ture of their prehistoric settlement and subsistence. Though the archaeology of Jwokrama Forest is in its infancy, a number of significant sites have been identified within the Reserve (Fig. 2) that address these questions. The archaeological data indicate sig- nificant Archaic and Horticultural occupations (Ta- ble 6) documented by a twenty-nine sites that in- clude habitation sites, manufacturing stations, groundstone features, and petroglyphs. While no ev- idence of Paleo-Indians has been identified, it is like- ly that such evidence will come to light given the appearance of Paleo-Indians elsewhere in Guyana and Amazonia(see Williams 1985a, Plew 1997). It seems likely that Paleo-Indians utilizing the North Rupununi would have intruded into the lwokrama forest. This is of interest as Paleo-Indian artifacts have been reported elsewhere in Guyana The Archaic Period from 7,000 to 3,500 B.P. sug- gests a pattern of broad spectrum foraging and a range of associated sites that are well documented within the Reserve. On the Essequibo, Archaic pe- riod sites include petroglyphs, sharpening grooves and a chipping station. In general, petroglyphs be- long to the Enumerative and Fish Trap Petroglyph Traditions (Williams 1985a). The presence of the fish trap petroglyph is important since its distribu- tion is known primarily from the rivers to the south. Its presence in Iwokrama suggests that the pattern may be more widespread and that the fisheries man- agement strategy on the Kassikaityu River (Williams 1979b) was also in Iwokrama Forest. Though Wil- liams (1985a, 1996) has argued that the use of fish- eries glyph markers is associated with periods of Ho- locene desiccation, some may have been associated with seasonal water levels, which obviously will have varied. Notable, is Williams's (1996) documentation of the presence of the so-called Cuneiform glyph. As a sub-type (technique) of the Enumerative Tra- dition, this represents its first identification in Guy- ana. The Archaic settlement of Iwokrama indicates oc- cupation of different resources in various locations within the forest and along the rivers. The range of site types suggests that Archaic peoples were both processing local products and manufacturing stone tools. The latter is particularly interesting in that the extensive nature of the quartz deposits at Inscription Rock may indicate that Iwokrama was an important source of lithic raw materials. Some Archaic sites in Iwokrama and the North Rupununi are noticeably similar to recently discov- ered sites at Petit Saut on the Middle Sinnamary River in French Guiana (Vacher, Jeremie and Briand 1998). In particular, there are marked similarities in the types of pollisoirs and what appear to be man-</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY OF IWOKRAMA 25 Table 6. General chronology of Iwokrama sites.

The latter are particularly interesting because such sites have only recently been reported in the Rupununi (Plew &amp; Pereira 2000). In general, the groundstone features resemble those described by Geijskes (1961:79-94) for the Coppename area in Surinam. This raises an important question about the age of such features. Radiocarbon dates from the Sinnamary River area in French Guiana range between 1660 and 220 B.P. suggesting that these features most probably occur in both the Archaic and later Horticultural Periods. The implication for Iwokrama and the North Ru- pununi is that sites described by Williams (1985b, 1996) as Archaic sites include the artifacts and fea- ture inventories similar to the horticultural period. Hence, in some instances the mere absence of ce- ramics in what may be task-specific areas has re- sulted in their being described as Archaic. The settlement pattern of the Archaic may be de- scribed as one in which sites were situated along major river courses and near falls and rock outcrops. The locations and sizes of sites suggest that foraging populations utilized the fisheries and forest resourc- es. Exploitation of these resources was possible be- cause stone tools had been made from locally ac- quired materials. The recent discovery of aboriginal sites along tertiary drainages (Plew 2002a) away from major rivers may indicate an intensive use of Iwokrama. Settlement in the Rupununi is charac- terized by sites along major waterways and near the forest. The Horticultural Period, dating between 3,500 B.P and the Historic period, is documented by eight horticultural sites located along banks of the Esse- quibo and Siparuni Rivers. Excavations at sites on the Essequibo River, particularly those from Errol's Landing, documented a wide range of ceramic bowl and globular forms including carinated vessels. Though the majority of ceramics from Horticultural occupations in the Reserve are undecorated (&gt;90%), decorated wares do include the use of red- on-white painting, incisions, punctation (noding), brushing, stamping, modeling, and fingernail inci- sions. Most ceramic types are similar to Koriabo, Taruma and Rupununi types with undecorated (utilitarian) wares significantly more common. Notably, test excavations at Errol's Landing indi- cate a human presence in the reserve at about 3000 B.P, if not earlier. The recovery of early Polychrome Horizon Style ceramics may prove significant in un- derstanding the origins and distribution of this ware in Guyana and the region. This establishes at the moment a greater antiquity for settlements in Iwok- rama than in the surrounding areas, and as with Kurupukari Falls suggests a degree of permanency of occupation associated with fisheries and horti- cultural activities. Recent discoveries near Toka Village indicate that</page><page sequence="20">26 M. G. PLEW similar wares were produced locally or traded be- tween Iwokrama and the North Rupununi. The set- tlement pattern in Iwokrama is one in which Hor- ticultural villages/encampments were located on larger river terraces and near falls and estuaries. It suggests continued emphasis on fishing during the Horticultural Period. In the Rupununi some settle- ments were located on hilltops overlooking the sa- vannah. Within the forest areas, caves and rock- shelters appear to have commonly served as burial locations and for other ritual purposes. It appears that neither Iwokrama nor the North Rupununi saw significant Paleo-Indian occupation. In contrast, considerable evidence indicates exten- sive use of the savannah and adjacent rain forest during the Archaic and Horticultural periods. Dur- ing these periods there is considerable similarity in the material culture and range of sites. An important issue is the degree of variability in local versus re- gional adaptations. The present level of archaeolog- ical investigations do not allow for observations re- garding the influence of environmental change upon shifting procurement strategies of prehistoric peo- ples in the area. At present, the absence of dated stratigraphic con- texts prevents adequate delineation of more precise relationships between the settlement-subsistence strategies of Iwokrama and those of the North Ru- pununi. Future investigations should more widely identify the distribution and range of site types within the areas. They should conduct excavations that develop more detailed chronologies and allow for the description of a regional settlement regime. Future work should identify archaeological features within sites and develop paleo-environmental data for purposes of assessing long-term variations in pro- curement strategies. More detailed archaeological re- search should provide important insights regarding the regional human ecology of the Iwokrama forest and adjacent savannah as well as of other areas throughout the Guianas.
