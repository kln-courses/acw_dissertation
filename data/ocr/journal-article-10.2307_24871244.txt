Therefore, a great deal complex identities, resulting from their animal, plant, about the meanings of colors and the logic behind the or mineral origin, their physical properties, and their Aztec worldview can be learned from a study of the real or imagined provenance, among other attributes. materials employed to adorn bodies.

The Nahuatl word for color, Western or modern eye, they were different to an Aztec tlapalli, means "dyed thing," but also refers to pigments one. This difference lies in the aforementioned identities used for painting, materials tinted with colorants, and attributed to the elements of the natural and social red dyes, especially cochineal (Molina 1970:2:130v; environment in this culture.

To date, the use of these two categories of sources has been unbalanced: Images of gods have been thoroughly studied, but little attention has been paid to descriptions of the material composition of their adornments. Comparing both historical and iconographie evidence, this essay focuses on representative cases of white, red, and black materials used in the corporal ornamentation of Aztec gods. The complexity of whiteness: The adornment of feather down and tizatl The Aztecs used a wide range of white elements found in nature to fashion corporal decoration: snowy egret feathers and unspun cotton for headdresses and earrings; white shells for necklaces and other jewelry; and bark paper, feather down, and a mineral known as tizatl for bodies and hair. Tizatl was the name the Aztecs employed to refer to diatomite, a sedimentary rock formed by the fossilized siliceous skeletons of microscopic algae known as diatoms (Diaz Lozano 1917).3 White feather down was called ihuitl, after the generic name for feathers in Nahuatl (Molina 1970:1:96v, 2:44r). Commonly assembled on the bodies of gods and men, these two materials created a meaningful white adornment. Certainly the best known ornamental use of tizatl and ihuitl was on the bodies of war captives destined for sacrifice in certain religious ceremonies. Their arms and legs were painted with diatomite and sprinkled with feather down, as was their hair (figs. 1-2). Michel Graulich (1987:164-165) has demonstrated that these captives were images of Mixcoatl, a divinity who was the prototypical sacrificial victim in Aztec ideology. As stated by the Dominican friar Diego Durân (1995:2:81, 83, 280), Mixcoatl's body was colored "from top to bottom with white stripes," while his representatives in rituals had their naked skin striped with tizatl. In the codices from Central Mexico, Mixcoatl is easily 3.

Moreover, the rites involving sacrificial adornment was also typical of divinities who had died victims adorned with tizatl and ihuitl were often aimed while giving birth to other gods, such as Toci, "Our at recreating the principal event of Mesoamerican Grandmother."

As Diana Magaloni Kerpel (2011:66-68) stresses, the fact that tizatl was a mud extracted from the bottom of lakes gives it a watery association, tying it with the realm of the humid and dark underworld. Diatomite's status as a mineral gave it an earthy connotation, as indicated by the fact that the Aztec rite of eating earth was known as "tasting tizatl" (Durân 1995:2:153). It also appears in a Maya myth that tells how the heroes of the cosmogonie adventure cast a spell on one of their enemies by sprinkling tizatl on the roasted fowl they invited him to eat. By means of this strategy, the white earth covering the food was intended to cover their enemy as well, sending him to his grave (PopolVuh 1960:46-47). On the other hand, the connections between tizatl and the sun are exemplified by the foundation myth of Mexico Tenochtitlan, when an eagle appears on a prickly pear, marking the end of the Aztec migration and symbolizing the rising of the sun. The version of this story in the Anales de Tlatelolco (1980:35) includes Figure 4.

Additionally, the body paint of the Lord of Dawn— a divinity that personifies Venus as the morning star— confirms that tizatl was a material that could evoke the a star motif on the body of this god alludes to the dawn, light of the rising sun. Like Mixcoatl, the Lord of Dawn the instant when the luminous rays of the rising sun often appears in codices with the lower part of his body whiten the horizon against the darkness of the night sky. adorned with stripes of tizatl against a red or yellow According to Ângel Maria Garibay (1995:19), the background, while the upper part of his body is dark ties between diatomite and the sun had to do with and ornamented with white discs (fig. 4).6 As for the the intense and brilliant color of the material. This significance of these colors and designs, Thelma Sullivan interpretation is reinforced by Hernandez's description (1976:259-260) has interpreted the white stripes on a of tizatlalli, which stresses its "very white color (color red background as a depiction of the emergence of light, blanquisimo)," and moreover by the Jesuit Miguel del while Seler (1908:175) proposed that the dark portions Barco's description of diatomite from Baja California: with white discs represented the starry sky.

These intrinsic blotting properties were emphasized by the manner in which the tizatl was produced, since indigenous peoples refined it through burning the mud they got from underneath the water. Certainly, the perception they had of tizatl as a dry substance derived from this combustion process, and favored its relationship with the sun. In the Aztec worldview, this celestial body was regarded as the origin of dryness in the world; it was the being that "cooked" the dwellers of the earth, including plants, thus resulting in their maturity (Dehouve 2003:65). Feather down, clouds, and stars Pre-Columbian iconography and colonial records offer little information on feather down. The pre-Hispanic artists depict this material as small white balls that are reminiscent of the soft and fluffy coats of eaglets. The sixteenth-century texts describe its ornamental function and its occasional ritual use as a complement of tizatl, but they include few indigenous exegeses regarding these practices. Due to the scarcity of data, most of the interpretations of the symbolism of feather down in scholarly literature come from modern Western perspectives rather than pre-Columbian views. An exception may be found in the opinion of Graulich (1982:50), who refers to the work of Durân to justify the celestial association of feather down, based on a fragment in which a shield adornment is presented as "the sky's attire." The problem is that, according to Durân (1995:2:56), this adornment was made not with feather down, but tufts of cotton. Despite his misinterpretation of the passage from Durân, Graulich was on the right track when he mistook cotton for feather down. Indeed, the friar himself confused these two materials: His description of cotton as "the sky's attire" is in reference to the god Tezcatlipoca's shield, but the corresponding illustration shows a shield decorated with feather down (ibid.:2:pl. 10). The same shield appears as part of the attire of the god Huitzilopochtli in another illustration of Durân's work; in this case the text says that the artifact was adorned with white feathers (ibid.:2:27, pi. 4). Furthermore, the few indigenous comments on feather down included in Sahagun's work reveal it had a close relationship with spun plant fibers, especially cotton. One example comes from the mythical tale of the god Huitzilopochtli's birth, in which his mother conceived him by placing against her bosom a ball of feather down that had fallen from the sky. In addition to establishing an indisputable link between feather down and the celestial realm, the myth equates the ball of down with "a tangle of spun thread" (Sahagün 2000:300). The Franciscan's informants also compare feather down and cotton with the web of the spider, the animal weaver par excellence, while the friar describes the ihuitl used during the festival of Ochpaniztli as being "smooth as cotton" (ibid.:234; Sahagün 1953-1982:9:93, 11:88). Finally, it is worth highlighting that the tie between these materials is also expressed in language: In the primitive form of Nahuatl, the same word was used for both cotton and feather down (Dakin 1982:118). Because documentation is virtually silent when it comes to the cultural values the Aztecs ascribed to feather down, its proximity to spun cotton offers an interesting lead, since the uses and meanings of this white fiber in Mesoamerica are abundant and well known. Among them stands out the association of cotton with clouds. The Aztecs, as well as some indigenous communities (including Nahuatl speakers) who now live in La Montana in Guerrero, conceived of clouds as beings who wear cotton clothing, based on the similarity between the appearance of the meteorological phenomena and the texture and color of this fiber (Ruiz de Alarcön 1984:57; Neff Nuixa 1997:302-303). At the same time, some Natives of northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States perceived a link between feathers and clouds or raindrops (Lumholtz 1945:2: 195-196; Se I er 1990-1998:5:57-58). This led Seler (ibid.:5:37) to propose that among the Aztecs, feather down was symbolic of clouds. As a whole, these data throw light on the expression "sky's attire" employed by Durân to refer to the cotton or feather down balls that adorn the shield of Tezcatlipoca. Since the human body was a model used to comprehend the cosmos in pre Columbian ideology (Lopez Austin 1988:1:346-384), it makes sense to call the clouds the "sky's attire." And that is not all. In the codices of Central Mexico, the stars were sometimes depicted—just as cotton or feather down—as white dots painted on a dark background representing the night sky (Codex Borbonicus 1991:8, 10, 11, 12). The same white discs are part of the facial painting of the aforementioned Venus god (fig. 4), and they also appear on the body of the quail, a bird closely linked to this planet (fig. 5).7 What is interesting is that, in certain circumstances, the white spots of both the Venus god and the quail are 7. This is because the quail flies primarily before dawn and, in Aztec mythology, is one of the first victims of the sun's bloody appetite, along with the Lord of Dawn.</page><page sequence="8">Dupey Garcfa: The materiality of color in the body ornamentation of Aztec gods 79 replaced by feather down balls, which are also scattered on a dark background (figs. 4, 6). As Seler (1963:2:59) proposes, this latter design is an iconographie variant of the starry sky. In summary, feather down had a strong relationship with the sky, but it was not a solar symbol; rather it represented other celestial bodies—namely, clouds and stars. The complex identity of this material recalls that of diatomite, which had strong ties with the underworld due to its aquatic origin and mineral nature, but also referred to the daytime sun because of its dryness as well as its intensely brilliant whiteness. Beyond its white color, the corporal ornamentation resulting from the conjunction of both materials created a subtle marking that alluded to the lights of day and night—the sun and the stars—but also to the clouds and to the underworld from which these meteorological phenomena—just as the tizatl—emerged. The meanings conveyed by tizatl and ihuitl coincides with the attributes of the gods and individuals that displayed this body ornamentation. Dead warriors and women who had died by giving birth were celestial beings who accompanied the sun during his daily course. But at night, they converted themselves into stars that shone in the nocturnal firmament (Seler F'gure 5- Figure °f a quail painted on the mouth of the goddess 1963:1:195-196).

Furthermore, some images their bodies and portions of their faces in several of Xipe Totec and Macuilxochitl show them in the center pictorial manuscripts (Codex Borgia 1993:11,15; Codex of the sun disk (Codex Laud 1994:1; Tonalamatl Aubin Vaticanus B 1993:70).

The colonial records all of them had a relationship with heat. They emitted it reveal that the Aztecs conceived of red ocher as a burnt or, conversely, they received it. The most obvious case is substance, thus associated with the sun and fire. For Xiuhtecuhtli, who was the source of heat par excellence example, Flernandez (1959:3:409) points out that "what as the male aspect of the fire god. The representations the Mexicans called Tlâhuitl [. . .] is a sort of yellow of Xochipilli, Macuilxochitl, Xipe Totec, and his avatar earth that turns red when it is burnt." At the same time, Tlatlauhqui Tezcatlipoca tend to connect them to the the root tlaui was at the origin of a lexical complex complex of solar deities, who radiated light and heat. In employed to refer to the light dispensed by the daytime fact, they all share features with the gods that personified sun and by torches (Molina 1970:2:144v, 145r).

It is most likely that this way of naming red had been influenced by the way red ocher is obtained, since it becomes red when it is put on the fire. Beyond this linguistic evidence, it is interesting to examine which materials occasionally substitute themselves for tlauitl on the bodies of the gods, because they are also related to fire and light. On a wooden mask representing the face of Xiuhtecuhtli, for instance, red ocher was replaced with a mosaic made with the shell tapachtli, which is characterized by its bright reddish hue (Sahagun 1953-1982:2:161, 10:59). Also, the parrot feathers that the Aztecs called cuezalin were sometimes applied to Xochipilli's body instead of red ocher (Codex Tudela 2002:17r, 410). In rituals, these feathers symbolized the brilliance of the fiery flames and the sun's rays, while in metaphorical language their name refers to fire (Sahagun 1953-1982:2:147, 161, 4:6, 6:239, 9:65). The use of these feathers and shell in place of red ocher on the bodies of some gods reinforces the idea that the adornments made with tlauitl denote heat. Contrasting black and vegetal substances: Body paintings made of rubber or soot Pre-Columbian iconography and colonial records provide information on the animal, vegetal, and mineral materials employed to blacken bodies in Aztec society. For example, black and iridescent turkey feathers enter in the composition of complex headdresses, and obsidian was converted into mirrors that were placed on different parts of the body. In corporal painting, at least four substances were commonly used: soot, melted rubber, bitumen, and apetztli, a shiny and sandy mineral, the identification of which is uncertain (Dupey Garcia 2010:2:454-458). Apetztli signaled the warrior, while bitumen—named chapopotli in Nahuatl—was the feminine adornment par excellence, because its emanation from the sea was regulated by the cycles of the moon (Dupey Garcia 2011:5—6). Rubber and soot, finally, stand out as substances whose characteristics and origins were so remarkable to the Aztecs that they used them to adorn the most significant members of their pantheon. Ornamental and religious uses of rubber To blacken the bodies of their gods, the Aztecs regularly employed melted rubber, which they called olli and obtained from the latex of the Castilla elastica tree. Some of these deities exhibited only a light application of rubber on their faces, while others were completely covered with it. This was the case for earth and rain deities, whose prototype was known as Tlaloc, but also as Olio, meaning "He who has Rubber" (Sahagun 1953-1982:1:7, 37, 6:115). Deities exhibiting smaller marks of rubber include the flayed god XipeTotec, the fire gods Ixcozauhqui and Chantico, the water goddess Chalchiuhtlicue, and the aforementioned Toci, as well as other mother goddesses. All of them had olli smeared on some part of their faces, most commonly the lips (ibid.:1:19, 40; Durân 1995:1:434-435; Sahagun 1997:100,102,105,110,112). Descriptions of Aztec festivals confirm the ties that rubber had with these divinities. Rubber was used copiously in the rituals dedicated to water, rain, and earth gods, to paint, model, or spatter their representatives, their priests, their offerings, and the implements required in their veneration (Sahagun 1953— 1982:1:47, 2:43-44, 85-89, 92, 132, 151-152). Rubber was also required during the preparations for the festival honoring the flayed god, during a parade that displayed the captives destined for the "gladiatorial sacrifice" (ibid.:2:45). The symbolism that surrounded these captives was multilayered, and in this context they were regarded as human representatives of ripe maize ears (Graulich 1999:309-314). Consequently, their bodies were covered with red ocher—the distinctive decoration for mature corn, as demonstrated above—and striped with dripping rubber. Likewise, olli was employed in the rites that involved the bundles of ripe corn whose grains were preserved for sowing. The paper in which they were wrapped was not only covered with red ocher, but also splattered with rubber (Sahagun 1953-1982:2:63).9 This last ritual practice reveals that Chicomecoatl, the goddess of the harvest, belonged to the group of deities adorned with rubber, since these bundles of corn were her vegetal image. The iconography also supports this proposal: In the codices, the red Chicomecoatl displays cheeks painted with the same parallel black bars that denote the presence of rubber on maize (Codex Vaticanus A 1996:44r; fig. 7).10 9. As mentioned before, these ears of corn were kept as the granary's heart in the temple of the maize gods during a ceremony dedicated to Chicomecoatl. Later, during the festival of Toci, they were stripped of their kernels and sowed ritually in the four directions (Sahagün 1953-1982:2:63-64, 124-125). 10. It has to be highlighted that the Aztecs did not used rubber as a pigment to paint codices, ceramics, and stone sculptures, since this organic material was probably not resistant enough to remain for long in these supports. However, some conventional designs—among them the two parallel black bars—were used to visually specify</page><page sequence="11">82 RES 65/66 2014/2015 Nourishing and fertilizing: The meanings of the rubber coating In light of the coincidence between the ornamental and religious practices involving rubber, it is worth reflecting on the attributes held in common by the gods who shared this plant-based coating. It is also instructive to delve into the physical features and properties of rubber that may have influenced the meanings the Aztecs assigned to this substance. Among these characteristics, the sixteenth-century sources reveal a particularly relevant piece of information that is undoubtedly of indigenous origin: the fundamental analogy between the sap or latex of plants and nutritious or fertilizing liquids like milk, semen, and blood.11 This analogy is manifest in codices, where we observe that the sap of trees can possess the virtues of mother's milk and feed infants who died at an early age (Codex Vaticanus A 1996:3v); it also appears as blood seeping from cut trunks (fig. 8). In an episode from Quiche Maya mythology, the heroine uses a rubber-like sap to produce a substitute for her heart (PopolVuh 1960:61). Finally, several modern Mesoamerican languages—including Yucatec, Otomi, and Lacandon—illustrate the continuity of this idea, as they use the same word for mother's milk, semen, blood, sap, and latex (Barrera Vazquez 1991:359; Galinier 1990:622-623; Marion Singer 1992:2:778-784). The analogy between the vital fluids of humans and plants stems from both their physical properties and their similar functions.12 At the same time, these substances share the status of human and divine food in pre-Columbian ideology. The Aztecs believed that semen nourished fetuses as they grew in their mothers' wombs, while milk fed infants as they drank from their mothers' breasts (Lopez Austin 1988:1:299). As for blood and rubber, they were burned as incense to sustain the gods (Graulich and Olivier 2004:123-125). These nutritive virtues help explain why some divinities were painted with rubber. It was most often the lips that were covered with this material, a practice that brings to mind the custom of smearing the mouths of the gods' statues when the black color was originated from rubber (Carreön Blaine 2006:105-156). 11. The fertilizing power attributed to blood in Aztec culture is evident in the ritual practices that consist of performing libations with this liquid, which is poured on the earth to guarantee agricultural fertility. It should be recalled that, according to myths, the earth's surface was created from the body of a goddess who said she would not produce fruit until she was fed with human blood (Thévet 1905:29). 12. Both blood and sap circulate within organisms and spring forth when the skin or bark is cut, coagulating to form scabs. Figure 7. Chicomecoatl, the goddess of harvest, with body arid attire covered in red ocher. Her cheeks are painted with two parallel bars of rubber.

The relationship between blood and rubber as coatings for lips is made evident in codices, where the black splotch that simulates olli on Toci's mouth is occasionally replaced by a red mark; this insinuates that her lips could be covered either with rubber or with spots of blood (Codex Fejérvâry Mayer 1994:23, 30, 32, 35). Apart from explaining its presence on the mouth of divinities, rubber's association with blood, semen, and milk suggests this material was regarded as a fertilizing fluid. This is supported by the similar use of blood and rubber to increase agricultural yields. It is not by chance that melted rubber was applied to ears of maize before they were sown, while blood from a sacrificial victim representing a water goddess was scattered on a pile of corncobs before a new crop was planted (Codex Borbonicus 1991:31). A comparable procedure took place with captives who personified mature corn during</page><page sequence="12">Dupey Garcia: The materiality of color in the body ornamentation of Aztec gods 83 the festival of the flayed god. As mentioned above, they were striped with rubber during the preparatory procession of the festival, and then scratched until they bled in the "gladiatorial sacrifice" (Codex Zouche-Nuttall 1992:83; Graulich 1999:289, 309-314). The treatment inflicted on these victims resembles the incisions made on rubber trees during latex extraction, a practice known as "bleeding" in contemporary Mexico (Valdés and Flores 1986:89). The fertilizing quality of rubber explains its utilization to paint the members of the pantheon responsible for plant growth. These deities included Toci and other mother goddesses, whose personalities articulated the notions of maternal and plant fertility: As the mothers of the gods and of men, they were considered incarnations of the earth (Nicholson 1971:420), which the Aztecs imagined as a huge womb from which life emerges. At the same time, rubber served as a coating for the god Tlaloc, who was conceived of as the fertilizer of the earth because he scattered the rains. In fact, Tlaloc's role in vegetal fertility was such that Sahagün's informants describe him as the god who causes "trees, grass, [and] corn to flourish, germinate, become covered with leaves, bloom, [and] grow."13 This conception of Tlaloc clarifies why rubber was the ideal material to be smeared onto divinities responsible for plant fertility: Among black figure 8 Split tree spewing blood After Codex Vaticanus B, pi. ■ xl , 37 (detail), pre-Hispanic, Central Mexico.

In pre-Columbian this deity was indeed more complex than it might seem, times, black inks were made from diverse mineral and because it was composed of a double black coating. plant materials, such as copper sulfate and tree bark. Sixteenth-century texts state that Tlaloc's face was The double meaning of tlilli suggests, however, that blackened with a soot-based ink as well as olli (Sahagün the most common ink was prepared with soot. As a 1953-1982:1:7), and some painters of codices employed term that refers both to ink and to the residue of wood two distinct dark tones to color the rain and earth god combustion that originated it, the polysemy of tlilli gives (Carreön Blaine 2006:134).

Moreover, the During their religious preparation, they, too, were myth of the creation of the Fifth Sun reveals that the rain covered in soot ink (Sahagun 1953-1982:3:61-63), god's son was pushed into the ashes of the fire where the ornamentation that they continued to use when they sun had been created; he then emerged as the moon, became adults and joined the priesthood. with his face "ashy" (Garcia Icazbalceta 1941:216).

The sky was printed on the jaguar's pelt (Codex Vaticanus B ink ornamentation served, then, as a sign of their 1993:87). relationship to these gods. Taken together with the Coming back to tlilpopotzalli, in addition to expressing importance of the igneous origins of tlilpopotzalli, this Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca's connection to the starry invites inquiry as to what bound Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca together, and what associated them with soot and burned things—especially since the fire god Xiuhtecuhtli was also painted with this ink. Tlilpopotzalli: Painting light in darkness Aztec mythology presents Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca as two enemy brothers who inspired and orchestrated the creation of the world. The myths also explain that as a result of their success, the primordial deity converted them into lords of the stars (Garcia Icazbalceta 1941:214). This metamorphosis offers a valuable clue for interpreting the soot body paint used for these demigods. Indeed, tlilpopotzalli was linked to fire because of its origins, and darkness because of its color, while the stars were conceived of as fires lit in the night sky (Graulich 1987:100-103). The characteristics of soot-based ink thus make it an ideal material to refer to fires that burn in the darkness. The stellar association of this ink is supported further by the iconography of Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca. In the Codex Borgia, Figure 9.

Although the rain and earth deity is clearly not a star, he is associated nonetheless with the appearance of light in darkness by being the wielder of another celestial fire: lightning. Like the stars, lightning shines in the midst of the stormy sky, which pre Columbian peoples equated with darkness (PopolVuh 1960:31). The relationship between stars and lightning is also observable in the iconography, where the spots of the jaguar's pelt sometimes adopt the shape of a flattened "S" that represents Ursa Major, but also a simplified version of the lightning bolt held byTlaloc (Codex Zouche-Nuttall 1992:50; Couvreur 2004:182-183). Again, this reconstruction of the symbolic values of tlilpopotzalli is corroborated by an examination of the materials that sometimes took the place of this ink to Figure 10.

This is due to stones is a delicate matter, Molina (1970:2:101 r) and the fact that the natural elements employed to make Sahagün (1953-1982:9:86; 2000:913) employ the adornments were themselves bearers of identity and term "jet" to translate their names. This is due to the conveyers of meaning. fact that the friars perceived jet as an intense, brilliant The construction of this identity could rest upon the black stone (Durân 1995:2:47), while the teotetl and physical characteristics of a given material, as in the case tezcapoctli stones stood apart, according to the Aztecs, of feather down.

At the same time, as flexibility and interchangeability were dominant features of Aztec ideology, associations between human or divine individuals and specific natural elements were not irrevocably fixed. Parrot feathers could therefore be substituted for red ocher on the body of the god Xochipilli, because both materials alluded to warmth and light: red ocher for being a burnt mineral and feathers for their glowing effect. Likewise, black and lustrous stones could stand in for soot-based ink when the face adornment of Xiuhtecuhtli and Tezcatlipoca was represented on wood or bone supports. Ultimately, this approach inspires a new way of looking at corporal ornamentation and, more generally, at colors in Mesoamerica. Although color and chromatic compositions are important in and of themselves, it is high time to explore more deeply and systematically the meanings underlying the selection and the uses of the materials that colored the pre-Columbian world.
