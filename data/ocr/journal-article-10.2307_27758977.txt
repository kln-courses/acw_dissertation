<plain_text><page sequence="1">ACTION FROM KNOWLEDGE AND CONDITIONED BEHAVIOUR PART THREE: THE HUMAN CASE James Russell The University of Liverpool This three-part series of articles represents an attempt to show how action taken from knowledge - sometimes called "practical reasoning" - is related to behaviour causally determined by environmental regularities. The first paper (Russell, 1980a) began by considering the view that op?rant behaviour can be conceptualized as expressing primitive states of knowledge whereas classical phenomena cannot (Hamlyn, 1971a). However, the experimental evidence disallows such a neat conceptual split, and learning theorists have been more concerned to stress the classical features of op?rant conditioning (e.g., Bindra, 1978) and the op?rant features of classical conditioning (Segal, 1972). There fore the following solution was proposed: op?rant phenomena may evince either "regulated" (causal, mechanistic) or "epistemic" (utilizing knowledge) features depending on the phase of learning being studied and the experimental paradigm. In turn, regulated behavior could either be "directed" or "manda tory" (e.g., autonomie and reflexive behavior). This led to a* four-way classi fication of regulated behaviour in terms of whether it was directed or mandatory and whether it was response-contingent or stimulus-contingent (Drc, Dsc, Mrc&gt; Msc) In the second paper (Russell, 1980b) my aim was to set up the criteria on which epistemic behaviour could be distinguished from these species of regulated behaviour and to justify the assumption that a necessary condition for a type of behaviour being epistemic is that it be directed rather than mandatory. These three criteria (behavioural flexibility, prospective reference, the behaviour being a cause of environmental effects) were illustrated by reference to actual and possible experimentation. For example, I argued that the phenomenon of "learned irrelevance" (Mackintosh, 1975) failed to attain epistemic status because its mandatory nature made the necessary behavioural flexibility im possible of attainment. Similarly, and notwithstanding Revusky's (1977) ref erence to such behaviour as "epistemic," conditioned taste aversion phenomena failed on the third criterion that the animal should be acting as a cause of environmental effects. Certain conditioning phenomena such as shaping by successive approximations and "learned helplessness" fulfilled the criteria, or rather held out a promise of doing so. The final task is now to relate such a scheme to human epistemic behaviour and to human behaviour which we would wish to say was regulated by environ 107</page><page sequence="2">James Russell mental contingencies. This will involve three different kinds of discussion. First, I will tackle the relation of epistemic behaviour in nonverbal creatures to verbal judgments which express knowledge. Next, the regulated-epistemic transition will be contrasted with Piaget's assimilation-accommodation model of learning ? the major theory of human learning at present - in order to show that the accounts are compatible and complementary. Finally I will discuss how the stream of human behaviour may be canalized by regulative processes of both the directed and mandatory varieties. NONVERBAL AND VERBAL EPISTEMIC BEHAVIOUR In what has gone before I have been talking quite freely of an animal's "knowledge" and "belief about the consequences of its behaviour. The cri teria of Part Two were supposed to set a lower limit on such ascriptions, but what of an upper limit? For it is reasonable to propose that there must be a point beyond which human knowledge about the consequences of behaviour is located and before which the ascription of knowledge about causal regularities to wholly nonverbal creatures stops. There would seem to be such a point, otherwise the worst kind of anthropomorphism would be justified. It is unlikely that we could ever say where ? ontogenetically or phylo genetically ? such an upper limit of ascription might be drawn, but it should be possible to say something about how the epistemic behaviour of an operantly conditioned rat, for example, differs from that of the person who says "When I press that lever I get a chocolate bar," something beyond the mere statement that one is nonverbal and the other verbal. That there is such a difference is an assumption I will make at the outset without prejudice to whether this difference should be regarded as an unbridgeable epistemic gulf or one resulting from something like the "greater informational complexity" of the human case. Some suggestions will emerge about how we should conceptualize this difference by the end of the section. A recent article by Donald Davidson (1975) which addresses itself to just this problem has received a good deal of critical attention (e.g., Bishop, 1980; Denkel, 1980). In it the thesis is advanced "that a creature cannot have thoughts unless it is an interpreter of the speech of another." For "thoughts" one can substitute "beliefs" in this claim because, for Davidson, "a thought is defined by a system of belief ' (op. cit., pg. 9). The implication that animals cannot have beliefs because they lack the ability to interpret language would appear to go directly counter to the theme of the present series of papers, for we have been assuming the epistemic criteria afford evidence of belief states. Davidson's thesis grows out of the theory of meaning which he has been developing over the past few years (see Davidson, 1967, 1973, 1974) ? indeed given this theory of meaning there is almost no other thesis that could be offered about the possibility of belief states in nonverbal creatures. Davidson rejects the "behaviouristic" conception of meaning of Quine (1960) and the attempt to analyze meaning in terms of nonlinguistic intentions in "the tradition ... of 108</page><page sequence="3">Part Three Mead and Dewey of Wittgenstein and Grice" (Davidson, 1974, p. 311) in order to propose a theory in the Fregean tradition which extends Frege's basic com mitment to the elucidation of linguistic meaning via the concepts of truth, judgment, and belief.1 This is tackled by analyzing the understanding of the meaning of an utterance in terms of the listener's ("interpreter's") knowledge of the circumstances under which the speaker holds the sentence to be true. Beliefs are crucial because if the interpreter knows that the speaker holds a sentence to be true and can interpret the words as meaning such-and-such then a belief can be attributed to the speaker. Conversely if the interpreter knows what the speaker's belief is and that he holds the sentence as true then the interpreter will be able to deduce that the sentence means such-and-such. Thus, linguistic meaning, belief, and truth form a circle of mutual dependence such that each concept has to be elucidated in terms of the others. In a critical paper on the Davidson thesis Bishop (1980) gives the following abstract of the argument: Premise 1: Only a language user can have the concept of belief; Premise 2: Only a behaver who has the concept of belief can have beliefs; Conclusion: Only a language user can have beliefs. Bishop's quarrel is not with the transitive inference but with the grounds for the premises. Premise 1 follows from Davidson's account of meaning as interpretation of utterances; the problem facing the interpreter is to develop a theory about the truth con ditions so as to fill the blank in the following: "An utterance of sentence s by a speaker at at time t is true if and only if.."He has to test his theory about what these conditions are against evidence. But what can complicate matters is that although a speaker may hold a sentence as true it may not be true ? the speaker might have a false belief. So according to Davidson this is just where the concept of belief acquires its necessity ? in order to accom modate to the fact that the interpreter must be able to conceive the possibility that held truth and objective truth may not match, or, to put it in Davidson's customary metaphor to "take up the slack" between them. But all that Davidson has shown, argues Bishop, is that language users require the concept of belief, not the converse. Additionally, he rejects Davidson's apparent attempt to argue that there is no other way that the concept of belief could be "forced upon a mind" (Bishop, 1980, p. 10) other than through linguistic interpretation, principally because Davidson does nothing to justify the assumption that crea tures have to be logically forced to utilize a concept in order for them actually to possess it. Premise 2 (that only a behaver with the concept of belief can have beliefs) is stated rather than argued for by Davidson. However, it is again entailed by the possibility of error, this time error in one's own beliefs. A believer must necessarily have the concept of an error and a concept of an error entails the concept of a false belief, and this suggests the concept of belief itself. Bishop's However Davidson attempts to escape Frege's commitment to "meaning" as an abstract entity by employing a species of redundancy theory of meaning after Tarski which replaces the "meaning" of a sentence by its translation into an equivalent sentence in the language (see Platts, 1980, Chapter 2). 109</page><page sequence="4">James Russell main sceptical point here is that Davidson has not shown the essential connec tion between having the concept of error and having that of false belief. Belief, as considered by Davidson, is a linguistic notion (about taking up propositional attitudes to judgments); therefore, he can confidently state this premise by virtue of this assumption; but this assumption does not grow out of the concept of an error. As Bishop puts it "Davidson . . . proposes, in effect, that what is involved in the language users self-conscious awareness of an error ("Goodness! I really thought he could be trusted! What a fool I was to believe that!") pro vides the model for all recognition of error." (op. cit., p. 15). But how can we dismiss the possibility a priori that animals recognize errors without the rejection of a "content-bearing mental item?" Therefore, Davidson's second premise is not supported by the manifest necessity to having beliefs of recognizing errors, nor by anything else. But now it is time to try to relate Davidson's concerns about the role of error in belief and in language to our earlier ascriptions of states of belief and knowledge to operantly conditioned animals. Having done this, we can return to Davidson's thesis, via Jonathan Bennett, able to extract what is nutritious and important from an argument which ? as Bishop seems to succeed in showing ? is not satisfactory as it stands. If the epistemic criteria are fulfilled in cases where a rat presses to obtain food and where food is indeed the consequence, we have a choice of saying either "The rat believes that pressing leads to food" or "The rat knows that pressing leads to food." However, on trials when food is not forthcoming we can only ascribe belief, because there is no such concept as false knowledge. This is another approach to the role of error in belief : in behaviour, belief is distinguished from knowledge after the event. But this does not serve to de marcate verbalized beliefs from behaviourally expressed beliefs. For exactly the same is true when an operantly trained human states: "If I press now I'll get some chocolate" ? if he is right then he "knows" and if he turns out to be wrong then he only "believes." The belief/knowledge distinction appears to be drawn on the same criterion whether behaviour or language is involved. So considerations such as this ? plus Bishop's ? may lead us to wonder whether there is anything to prevent us from ascribing beliefs to animals as freely as we wish. Indeed if Davidson's argument is not successful, the approach adopted in Linguistic Behaviour by Jonathan Bennett (1976), whereby beliefs are unam biguously ascribed to nonverbal creatures on behavioural evidence looks more promising. Or as Bishop puts it: "Davidson's 'how could dumb animals possibly have the concept of belief?' challenge can be countered by Bennett's 'how could it possibly be denied that they can?' once it is conceded that the situations whose description he (Bennett) sketched are logically possible" (op. cit., p. 11). What Bennett does in Linguistic Behaviour is to outline situations in which animals respond to each other's behaviour in such a way that we would be per fectly justified in ascribing beliefs to them, not only of the simple "believes that-pressing-causes-food" type but beliefs about another animal's beliefs. For example (see pp. 110-111) suppose animal a does something which we explain 110</page><page sequence="5">Part Three as believing that animal b is about to dive into the water; we might further have to explain this belief by the fact that a believes that b believes there is a predator nereby. Animal a typically hears an "ursine roar" just before b dives in the water and // certain other conditions are fulfilled (pp. 36-92) our way is clear for as cribing a belief to a about ?'s beliefs. Indeed Bennett takes the story further to envisage wholly nonverbal cases of #'s beliefs about ?'s beliefs about a's beliefs. But is not this liberalism as unhelpful as Davidson's a priori restrictiveness? The inherent weakness of the fable-making approach is that we cannot be sure that the only limitation on the extent of such ascription is not set by the imagi nation or the adVenturousness of the theorist. Kirk (1967), for example, has argued that Bennett (1964) stopped too soon in the fables which he sketched in Rationality: that the construction of a different fable about a race of nonverbal but practically "intelligent" creatures ("Cyclops") would enable us to separately ascribe knowledge of general truths and past particular events to them, which Bennett had argued it was only possible to evince in language. I believe that some route between Bennett and Davidson is offered when we attend to the fact that Bennett is concerned with justifying the ascription of beliefs to nonverbal creatures by verbal creatures (us) and that Davidson is con cerned with the possibility of any creature ascribing beliefs to others and to him self. But, of course, this is only a starting point. The matter can hardly be left here because merely saying that here we have two approaches rather than two directly incompatible theses solves nothing: we need to describe how the ap proaches by-pass each other and past what questions. If it is a question of the ascription of beliefs to creatures by human beings then it is difficult to see how we could ever conceptualize the difference between the well-conditioned rat and the person who says he expects a bar of chocolate having pressed a lever. But when we consider the question of the se//-ascription of beliefs as distinct from knowledge the case is different. As I said earlier, both in the conditioning case and in the case of verbal judgments, belief is distin guished from knowledge post hoc: if there is no rat food or chocolate forth coming, then we have belief not knowledge. However, in the verbal case ?nd not in the behavioural case there is the possibility of the agent making the distinc tion for himself. Only linguistic behaviour can express the distinction between believing something and thereby holding out the logical possibility of being wrong and claiming knowledge and holding out no such possibility. This is not intended as a challenge to the fable-makers: almost certainly some fable could be constructed a la Bennett in which an animal's behaviour expressed such a distinction ? or rather sanctioned our describing its behaviour in those terms. The point is, that because it is nonverbal such behaviour would only be grist to an interpretive mill, not the distinction itself. Moreover, as Davidson (1975, p. 16) points out, there is inevitably a degree of looseness in such attributions because the nonintentional nature of nonverbal behaviour leaves a range of options open to the interpreter between which there can never be sufficient criteria for selection. Neither is the claim being put forward that the belief/knowledge distinction 111</page><page sequence="6">James Russell can be made by language users prior to outcomes because they can employ the very words "believe" and "know" or because they can add riders to statements of the ". . . but I could be wrong" variety. Although such abilities must be far more than optional extras to honest assertion they trade on the distinction as it is implicitly present in the making of different kinds of judgment in different contexts. The belief/knowledge distinction is at the core of linguistic usage in a way that it never could be for nonverbal behaviour; this, I believe, is the valuable intuition which Davidson's argument expresses. For how could we ever ascribe adequate understanding of a language to an individual who could not recognize that "If I press the lever I get chocolate" expresses a belief and not knowledge in symmetrical contrast to a case where "That is a table" said whilst facing a table under good illumination expresses knowledge and not belief. If such a person gave no evidence of understanding how the two claims are fundamentally different then we would have to conclude that he did not know what he was claiming. This possibility of failing to understand the distinction does not appear to exist for purely behavioural cases. But what if the ingenuity of the fable-makers could be stretched to produce cases of creatures being confused between consequence and existence, would these not count as evidence of behavioural inability to draw the distinction? No, they would be cases of being confused between consequence and existence not of failing to distinguish between the different status which classes of behavioural acts can possess. And this is because acts do not express propositions but sen tences do. If the fable-makers were, however, able to come up with a saga in which a creature's behaviour failed to express fundamental normative distinc tions within a rule-bound system for expressing propositions then they would have "succeeded" by virtue of the fact that these would have to be called crea tures with a language. The above reference to the normative points to another way of expressing the matter, because language is normative in a way that nonverbal epistemic behaviour cannot be. The making of a judgment, whether a prediction based on past experience, or a statement about concrete experience or subjective expe rience, is double-edged: there is both the utilization of public, intersubjectively maintained norms of validity, truth, and appropriateness and at the same time the personal, self-reflexive element of expressing "how it is with me." In fact, this is not a million miles from Davidson's claim that the concept of belief "takes up the slack" between objective truth and held truth - although Davidson would not espouse anything like an intersubjective theory of truth. Therefore the belief/knowledge distinction is not only something that the speaker must understand as coming between different kinds of epistemic claim but as some thing which, in a somewhat different guise, prizes the self-reflexive, subjective element from the objective, normative element in any kind of verbal judgment. Such a viewpoint can be taken further to state, in a Wittgenstinian manner, some claims about the necessarily social origins of verbal epistemic knowledge ; Hamlyn (1980) has done something of this kind. So if verbal judgments entail the self-ascription of beliefs and knowledge 112</page><page sequence="7">Part Three whereas nonverbal epistemie behaviour can only leave open the possibility of such ascription being carried out by others, does this not suggest something about the essential self-consciousness of a creature who can state his knowledge ? something in the spirit of Kant's condition for "objective knowledge?"2 Bennett (1976) considers this "quite common view that self-consciousness . . . is possible only to creatures with language" (p. 112) and, at least with regard to mental states such as being in pain, would want to argue for it himself whilst asserting that a nonverbal creature can manifest a belief about another animal's belief about the first animal's belief. But Bennett says that there does not seem to be any clear way of justifying the decision to argue for both, especially as there is no good answer available to an objector who demands reasons for saying that animals who evince epistemie behaviour do not possess self-consciousness. It is very doubtful that there could ever be such reasons; but such a lack is not especially troublesome so long as we keep in mind the distinction between self ascription and ascription by others. Indeed the distinction is perhaps sufficient to justify Bennett's holding both arguments at once. The suggestions made above about the belief/knowledge divergence being possible only in verbal creatures are intended as a way of describing the distinction between self-ascription and ascription by others. Perhaps they will also make us less embarrassed about drop ping the "-" from statements about conditioned rats knowing or believing that the consequences of their acts are such-and-such. Once the divergence between the animal and the human cases is adequately described anthropo morphism ceases to be such a danger. In order to employ these suggestions in the final section of the paper I would like to tag them with some terminology. I will call nonverbal knowledge of the kind evinced by an operantly conditioned rat who has fulfilled the epistemie criteria immediate knowledge which is primitively conscious and the knowledge evinced in the statement that a lever has to be pressed to obtain chocolate mediate knowledge which is self-conscious. As to what more can be done to elucidate the status of verbalized as against behavioural knowledge, obviously philosophical analysis must play a major role; but it is well to bear in mind that the evolution from knowledge in action to knowledge in language is a classic problem in developmental psychology ? an issue with both an empirical and a philosophical face. Piaget, of course, has provided an account of this development, and it is to Piagetian theory that we turn next in order to compare the regulated-epistemic transition described in the two previous papers with the Piagetian theory of learning. 2"It must be possible for think' to accompany all my representations; for otherwise something would be represented in me which could not be thought at all, and that is equivalent to saying that the representation would be impossible, or at least would be nothing to me." (Kant: Critique of pure reason. Trans: N. Kemp-Smith, Macmillan, 1929, p. 152.) 113</page><page sequence="8">James Russell THE REGULATED - EPISTEMIC TRANSITION AND SCHEMATIC LEARNING The notion that an animal can be led to acquire knowledge of environmental potentialities as a result of being exposed to certain stimulus or response-contin gent regularities of its directed behaviour appears to directly conflict with the Piagetian claim that the acquisition of knowledge by an organism is ineluctably an active process. For the operantly conditioned rat is relatively passive insofar as it is the experimenter's manipulation of reinforcement which channels behav iour towards the epistemic level. Indeed such a contrast is at the heart of the present concept of regulated learning processes: one reason why I chose the term "regulated" was to contrast it with Piaget's term "autoregulated" (Russell, 1980a, p. 93). In autoregulated behaviour the organism is assumed to regulate its own interaction with the environment more or less intelligently rather than being regulated by the environment. Piaget's account is predicated on the assumption that learning is emphatically not a process whereby the organism acquires knowledge of its environment by virtue of stimulus or response-contin gent accompaniments to its directed behaviour. One could, of course, always claim that as Piaget's data are almost exclu sively from human development and the data with which we have been con cerned are from experiments with adult animals there is no real rivalry. But even if it were not the case that Piaget does intend his theory to cover all learning (Piaget, 1970) including that in animals and adults, we would still have to ex plore the possibility that, if Piaget has succeeded in showing the inappropriate ness of the conditioning model to human developmental phenomena he has also succeeded in proving the poverty of the conditioning model and its irrelevance to anything beyond a handful of experimental paradigms as employed with a handful of species. I wish to argue that Piaget has succeeded in showing that cognitive development does not proceed by conditioning but that there are other naturally occurring learning phenomena which the notion of a regulated epistemic transition is more adapted to explaining. In short, I want to demon strate a lack of fundamental rivalry between the two approaches to learning. Piaget (1953) contends that behaviour is reflexive in the first week or so of life, that is to say, determined by a set of phylogenetically-fixed reflex patterns such as the rooting and grasping reflexes. What he denies is that the elaboration away from these reflexes is carried by the environmental reinforcement of the appropriate behaviour. To take the case of grasping, initially the infant tightens his grip whenever a stimulus is presented to his palm; later, with apparent inten tionality, he grasps what can be felt with the fingers and later still what can be seen after the visual and tactual modalities have become coordinated. Piaget's main argument against the view that the elaboration from reflexes is determined by stimulus and reinforcement contingencies is that because the behaviour begins as a global totality within which action and object are undiffer entiated it cannot be that a piece of behaviour was reinforced by the environ ment since, in a reflex, behaviour and environment are one. The stimulus elicits 114</page><page sequence="9">Part Three the response but the organism can have no knowledge of the stimulus as any thing distinct from itself. This entails the following difficulty for the reinforce ment theory: it can deal with the stimulus-response nature of the fixed reflex pattern but it does not have the conceptual resources to explain how the infant gradually comes to move beyond the elicited to achieve voluntary, self-moni tored, and later, planned actions. The case is quite different from that of shaping by successive approximations: here the experimenter rewards relatively random, spontaneous behaviour until the behaviour attains a stability by virtue of the organism's having learned a connection between action and consequence. Shap ing exploits what has already occurred, or is likely to occur, whereas the neo natal performance of a reflex to a stimulus is the elicitation of a pattern fixed by biological endowment. The transition from the regulated to the epistemic is not comparable to that from the rigidly reflexive to the voluntary. In the former case a new piece of behaviour may be established through shaping by trading on the fact that an organism will repeat what immediately preceded a reinforcer (rats do not habitually press protruding objects); but in the latter case we are dealing with the same piece of behaviour (e.g., sucking, grasping) first causally determined by one specific stimulus and then determined by a goal held by the infant which depends on some environmental knowledge ? in Piaget's termi nology, by a scheme. In fact, I will refer to Piaget's theory as one of "schematic" learning. When the infant brings his thumb to his mouth to suck it, where is the act as distinct from the reinforcement of the act? The case of grasping a seen object may appear to be more favourable to the conditioning theorist's case because here we can talk about a stimulus (sight of rattle) and a response (grasping it), but again what sense can we give here to the notion of the reinforcement of the act? Grasping is both the act and the reinforcement of it. As Piaget's observa tions show, sensorimotor development does not take place by the progressive environmental shaping of approximations to behaviours but by the dissolution of the rigid and passively elicited into the flexible and intentional. Reflex elaboration is supposed to take place in the following manner. All adaptive behaviour contains elements of "assimilation" whereby environmental data is made part of an existing behavioural category (e.g., rattles into "grasp ing"), and "accommodation" whereby the behaviour is modified in accordance with features of the world (e.g., rattles are grasped differently from the corners of a blanket). At the initial reflex stage assimilation and accommodation are undifferentiated. However, the organism is so constituted that the accretion of small failures of the stereotyped reflex to produce satisfactory accommodation leads to active adaptation. For example, to suck every object in exactly the same way inevitably means that sucking will be unsuccessful in many cases, without an element of modification of the pattern (accommodation); and conversely it means that the general goal of sucking becomes separable from particular, in creasingly more various, acts of sucking. Thus the production of schemes gets off the ground. A scheme can be regarded at the sensorimotor level as a kind of action-concept, or the assimilatory net (sucking, swinging, grasping, etc.) on the 115</page><page sequence="10">James Russell basis of which accommodation takes place. It is essentially because of the schematic nature of some adaptive behaviour that Piagetians and others can argue that learning is active. That is, when placed in an environment the organism is not merely capable of fixed reflex patterns, nor of an array of reinforcible op?rants, but has at the outset a cognitive "rough sketch" of environmental and behavioural potentialities, some knowledge of what can be done. The scheme is also, in part, a motivational (though not he donic) principle, determining what the organism will do at any one time. The assimilatory, motivational aspect of the scheme is what makes learning active; the accommodation to which it leads is what makes behaviour adaptive. The infant of a few weeks of age knows how to bring his thumb to his mouth to suck it, and thus what it has to do to achieve this and that certain movements are appropriate before it ever attempts to do the same with the rattle. The behaviour is not built up by regularities of stimuli and responses but by the organism out of already possessed schematic knowledge. Its notion of causality may be of the most rudimentary kind but it is locatable on a relatively step-wise progression towards more and more elaborated forms of causal knowl edge, a progression which takes the infant about two years to complete on the sensorimotor level. There is learning about the environment, according to Piaget, by virtue of the fact that the organism modifies its own behaviour constantly and thus acquires progressively greater degrees of behavioural flexibility, pro spective reference and causal knowledge (our three epistemic criteria). So al though Piaget's is a stage theory, the transition between stages is not as funda mental as that between the regulated and the epistemic levels. Let us further consider the difference between the regulated-epistemie tran sition and schematic learning. A major difference is in the way active schematic behaviour and passively regulated behaviour approximate to the achieved result. In the case of schematic learning each behavioural element of the learning proc ess is derived from the initial scheme by a gradual modification of the original set of actions. In contrast, the final shaped response (e.g., a lever press) may bear only a remote, contingent relationship to the pool of shapable behaviours (e.g., sniffing around the left-hand part of the chamber). In schematic learning the connection of the final action (e.g., how to scale a wall, how to eat a new kind of food, how to retrieve an object from behind railings) to its early approxi mation occurs by virtue of the behaviour; in the case of op?rant conditioning it occurs by virtue of how the environment is contingently organized. So stimulus and response regularities can provide a short-cut to the establishment of an efficacious scheme. That is to say, when a trained rat, on being placed in a Skinner box, immediately goes to the lever to press for food we are seeing a scheme, but one that was acquired by the regulating of environmental events. In this case the animal does not "find out for itself" but has its behaviour canal ized by the experimenter in such a way as to make the acquisition of the scheme inevitable. Let us contrast this with cases of schematic learning of the kind involved in Piaget's observations of retrieving an object tied to a piece of string (Piaget, 1953, observations 153-156) in 10-12 month old infants. Initially the 116</page><page sequence="11">Part Three infant does not realize that the object can be pulled towards her with the string. She then tried out a few familiar schemes such as shaking the string, some of which may cause the object to move slightly. But gradually she invents a pur pose-built scheme whereby the string is systematically shortened to obtain the object. The end result is epistemic and it was achieved by the application and invention of new schemes out of old. The infant began with a repertoire of schemes whereas the naive rat began with a behavioural repertoire which was determined far more by its phylogenetic endowment than by its environmental knowledge. Similarly, the dog who receives a shock in a shuttle-box charges around wildly until by chance it jumps into the other half; but this is not the application of a scheme until it has learned how to avoid the shock. Of course one would expect, within the stream of the animal's behaviour, to find a mixture of the instinctive3 and the regulated. The further up the phylogenetic scale we look the more likely we are to find schematic behaviour which is not a derivative of instinctive behaviour patterns. The topog raphy of behaviours which are essentially modifications of such patterns and that of genuine schemes may be very similar. For example, the behaviour of a bird trying to free a twig from a metal grid may be superficially similar to that of a human infant trying to extricate a rattle from behind the rungs of its cot, but in the former case we are almost certainly witnessing a direct outgrowth from behaviour patterns adapted for nest building. One would have to apply criteria similar to those drafted in the previous paper to determine the degree to which goal-governed behaviour (which can be anthropomorphized as "trying to do X") is more or less schematic or instinctive. Yet none of this is to deny that much animal behaviour is schematic; animals do, surely, "find out for themselves" on the basis of scheme application. If they did not they would only be adapted for survival in a perfectly benign environ ment where a God-like experimenter shaped them towards efficacious responses and where food, sex, escape, etc. were reliably correlated with certain neutral stimuli. But, conversely, it would be unadaptive for the animal to be reliant on schematic learning alone. This is because schematic learning only occurs when the rewards are intrinsic rather than hedonically extrinsic. The infant acts on the world through a "need to function" (Biihler, 1933) not in order to obtain re wards, and in this way builds up a cognitive map of its world. The "pleasure" is in the performance and the repetition of the act itself, as reflected in J. Mark Baldwin's (1902) term "circular reaction" which was later taken up by Piaget. (An example of such schematic learning in rats would be Tolman and Honzik's [ToIman, 1948] famous demonstration that rats will make progress in learning a maze without hedonic aliment ? behaviour and reward are one, as for Piaget 's infants.) But the animal must also be attuned to hedonically extrinsic consequences and correlates if it is to avoid danger and find food and sex. The aliments of the 3The caveats which normally accompany the use of the term "instinctive" will have to be taken as read in what follows. 117</page><page sequence="12">James Russell primary drives are extrinsic and the animal must surely require the most simple and effective means of forming associations with stimuli entailing extrinsic rewards. Thus its nervous system ensures that certain stimulus, response, and reinforcement regularities are utilized in accordance with rules such as "if the response caused pain, do not repeat it," "if that response brought pleasure, repeat it," "orient towards the cue associated with food" and many more com plex examples such as learned irrelevance. The animal need not "know" these rules in order to respond in accordance with them, but, according to the notion of a regulated-epistemic transition, some knowledge may result. It is possible that learning which is causally determined by extrinsic "rewards" should never lead to knowledge, that this should be the prerogative of schematic learning. But what would the consequences of such an arrangement be for the animal? They would be, in a nutshell, that the animal's responses to an environment would be quite separate from what it knew about the environment ? the cognitive model and the sensitivity to extrinsic rewards from the environment would be unrelated. It is difficult to envisage how such an animal would behave, but quite easy to appreciate that its behaviour would be extremely inefficient. There are at least two further advantages which the regulated route to knowl edge can be said to possess over the schematic route. First, regulated processes may provide "short-cuts" to the establishment of schemes in the natural environ ment, as already mentioned. Second, as Wolff (1960) has pointed out in an analysis of how the psychoanalytic emphasis on hedonically extrinsic processes in infant development relates to the Piagetian theory, the high motivational level which accompanies hedonic behaviour is likely to disrupt rather than facilitate schematic learning. Finally in this section, as the preceding discussion assumed much about the survival value of schematic versus regulated-epistemic processes it would be well to indicate briefly how the distinction can be expressed phylogenetically. Just as Skinner (1966), Staddon (1973) and others have drawn a parallel between op?rant conditioning and evolution by random mutation so one may parallel schematic learning by assimilation and accommodation and the neo-Darwinian notion of "genetic assimilation" developed by C. H. Waddington (1957), origi nated by J. M. Baldwin (1902), and utilized by Piaget (1971). Although Waddington accepts the role of random mutation in fixing a character within the genotype he proposes that the organism's interaction with its environment deter mines the locus and efficacy of genetic mutation. For example, it is implausible that the calluses on the ostrich rump were evolved by chance mutation. Initially certain "regulative processes" in development acted to produce calluses at a low stimulus threshold until the character was fixed by random-mutation taking over the role of callus-causing stimuli. Also, Waddington conceives the genotype phenotype route as a journey through a canalized "epigenetic landscape" rather than a preprogrammed sequence. The central notion in both Baldwin's and Waddington's theories is that the organism contributes to its relationship to the environment throughout evolution and thus that evolution results in higher and 118</page><page sequence="13">Part Three higher degrees of accommodatory plasticity rather than more and more sophis ticated genetically-governed programmes ? the organism does more than gen erate characters for the environment to select or not. Natural selection is a regulative process whereas genetic assimilation is an autoregulative process. REGULATIVE PROCESSES AND HUMAN BEHAVIOUR In this final section I wish to argue for there being nothing incoherent in the view that some features of human behaviour are explicable by regulative proc esses; indeed that conditioning theories provide a parsimonious means of analyz ing the stream of normal behaviour as well as its neurotic whirlpools. The prob lem, as always, is one of levels ? of finding the appropriate terms of analysis for the different levels of determination. We can agree with Piaget, with those theorists who regard learning as the acquisition of knowledge, and with those who treat the explanation of knowl edge utilization as the problem of modelling information flow, that what has here been labelled the regulated-epistemic transition is not, in humans, the normal mode of knowledge acquisition. Yet we can insist at the same time that regulative processes may be fundamental to human behaviour. What we know, as humans, we do not know because the environment has conditioned us to know it, but how we behave is not a complete function of what we know to be the case about ourselves and about the world: the stream of behaviour does not typically begin life as a cognitive model. What can be said, indeed, is that our four categories of regulative processes can plausibly be claimed to determine what we do and know we do and therefore account in part for the behavioural utilization of our cognitive capacities. Although the question about the extent and occurrence of the regulated-epistemic transition in human behaviour is clearly an empirical one, the conceptual question of whether such a model could in principle render some kinds of human action intelligible can be answered in the affirmative. I will begin with the transition between mandatory, stimulus-contingent behaviour (Msc), the most familiar case of which is the classical conditioning of autonomie responses, and epistemic behaviour. A schoolboy comes to play truant having experienced repeated humiliation by a sadistic master. This may be explicable in terms of classically conditioned aversion leading to purposive avoidance (epistemic) with all the cognitively sophisticated subterfuge that this may entail. As it is in the nature of associative connections to generalize, avoid ance may fan out to contingent features of the original aversive situation: to men with mustaches (if the master had a mustache), to any formal learning situation, perhaps even to the colour of the paint on the classroom walls. In this way the avoidance ceases to be "rational" ? there is no rational justification for linking the wearing of a mustache with sadistic tendencies. So what has happened is that, out of an Msc process, the future epistemic goals of the child have been canalized. Let us contrast this with a case of mandatory response-contingent processes 119</page><page sequence="14">James Russell (Mrc), that is autonomie responses (typically) whose repetition is determined by the outcome of their occurrence. In an Mrc-epistemic transition on the other hand the child in our example might have by chance suffered from a headache on one or more of the days he was due to be taught by this master, with the result that he is kept off school. The eventual result may be that he develops a psychosomatic migraine. The child then becomes aware (epistemic) of the effi cacy of these illnesses and later comes to sham illness, with this generalizing to the shamming of all kinds of indisposition and incompetence whenever he is faced with unpleasant duties. In this way there may be a move from illness being determined by regulative processes through being epistemically utilized to deter mining epistemic behaviour itself : an interweaving of regulative determination and purpose. These examples are all of neurotic behaviour but there are no reasons for supposing that the neurotic exhausts the category of behaviour that is canalized by mandatory associations. It is in the nature of "normal" purposive behaviour that it progresses through choice points which range from the major (whom to marry) to the trivial (where to sit on the bus). What "tips the scales" in favour of one set of actions or choices may often be explicable by reference to the set of positive or negative associations that certain stimuli, situations, behaviours may have for the agent, associations which can originate beneath the level of consciousness. But whether or not the associations are originally unconscious, their determining nature is the same by virtue of the fact that (and it is analytic that) we can never choose what we find unpleasant or pleasant,4 things are caused to have a positive or negative valence for us. We may rationally determine what we should or should not desire ? indeed this may be one of the distin guishing characteristics of human motivation (Frankfurt, 1971 ; Taylor, 1977) ? but not what we do in fact desire. By asserting the role of mandatory associa tions one is claiming that the positive and negative valences that things have for us are often not valences that they have in themselves but ones they have derived from past associations. The canalization of epistemic behaviour by mandatory processes is not the only kind of mandatory-epistemic transition. This may also occur when the agent becomes aware of what is determining his goals in a situation; or like the boy in the second example the agent may realize that certain mandatory states occur because they are efficacious. The difference between these two forms of transition need not be elaborated here. Some of the clearest cases of the regulative determination of directed behav iour, on the other hand, can be found during the course of social speech, for here behaviour is complex and rapid and may involve overriding goals such as giving a good impression, persuading, clairfying, as well as the finer level of illocutionary acts. For example, evidence has been provided (originally by Verplanck, 1955) that it is possible during the course of a conversation, but 4We may train ourselves to like or dislike things, perhaps by the use of conditioning procedures. But this should be regarded as manipulating our environment such that we are caused to like or dislike them. 120</page><page sequence="15">Part Three especially in an interview, for an experimenter to cause the subject to repeat certain words, phrases, or opinions without his being aware of it by selectively reinforcing their spontaneous production with smiles, nods and the like: speech can be shaped. Viewed another way we have an instance of behaviour being causally determined beneath the level of consciousness. But what of a Drc epistemic transition? The shaping might proceed to such a degree that the sub ject becomes aware that when he expresses himself in a certain way his argument is being more favourably received, or that he is making a better impression, in which case he might come to do deliberately what he had been originally shaped to do.5 Indeed such a parallel is exploited in a well-known cartoon in which one rat says to another: "Boy have I got this guy well trained. Every time I press this lever he gives me some food." Interlocutors may also shape each others' conversational strategies without being aware of doing so. As for Drc behaviour this would mean that each would tend to repeat certain kinds of anecdote, express certain opinions, accompany certain observations with a cynical smile if they were tending to make the other look attentive/impressed/angry depending on what were the, more or less, con scious social and extra-social goals. In the Dsc case the behaviour we are dealing with involves the conditions under which directed behaviour of a certain kind may be elicited from the agent because certain features of another's behaviour, or of the perceptual context, are associated with something with either a positive or a negative valence for him. For instance an individual may have formed an association between the Southern Irish accent and evasiveness, so that he may, quite unconsciously, produce brusquely reiterated requests for clarification and justification in conversation with Southern Irishmen. Similarly a person looking for another to open his heart to may pick on someone who peppers his con versation with swear-words through an association between rough talk and commonsensical sympathy, because these qualities were manifested in a favourite fictional character. In the light of these considerations it is possible to regard the "human relevance" of the laws of learning developed out of animal studies. Skinner and the radical behaviourists have tried to justify the application of op?rant prin ciples to human behaviour by trading on the fact that the Skinnerian concept of reinforcement is an essentially teleological principle (see Russell, 1980a, p. 88) and thus the epistemic element in animal learning was creamed off whilst ignoring fundamental questions about causal mechanisms underlying the acqui sition of conditioned responses. These associative, mechanistic principles may, it was argued, determine the stream of human behaviour at its choice points and thus determine and interact with action from knowledge. These regulative mechanisms may further be regarded an analogous to Freud's concept of pri 5Spielberger (1965) has argued on the basis of his own research that this is not genuine conditioning but rather the conscious modification of behaviour at the outset. Although the nature of the processes involved in "op?rant verbal conditioning" are not at present clear there is evidence (Rosenfeld and Baer, 1969) that at least in some cases individuals are not aware that their verbal behaviour is being conditioned by another. 121</page><page sequence="16">James Russell mary mental process; with the epistemic being the secondary processes. Indeed, as Boudreaux (1977) has argued recently, Freud's theory only has the kind of explanatory power he intended for it if the unconscious is regarded as mech anistic and causal, rather than as a parallel cognitive reservoir of thoughts, beliefs and so on. Because a regulated-epistemic transition can be effected in the human case these processes can be revealed in consciousness. This need not bring about a freedom from regulative determination (the associations need not necessarily become thereby weakened) but it will result in an extension of the area over which action from knowledge is possible. Our actions are still gov erned at some remove by our emotions but these emotions are less, in Spinoza's phrase, "passive emotions." The assumption which has thus far gone unanalyzed is that regulative proc esses are "unconscious" and epistemic processes are "conscious." There, is, in fact, an ambiguity here given the demarcation at the end of the first section between two kinds of consciousness. I said there that nonverbal "immediate" knowledge of the kind evinced by the operantly conditioned rat (if the epistemic criteria are met) involved "primitive" consciousness, whereas "mediate" knowl edge expressed through verbal judgments was "self-conscious." In the examples of human behaviour given above it is self-conscious knowledge that has resulted. However the assumption flows from the epistemic criteria that immediately epistemic behaviour must be primitively conscious given that the animal shows behavioural flexibility in relation to the goal, has some knowledge of the pro spective reference of its behaviour and treats itself as the causal agent. The epistemic criteria are criteria for an organism's knowing what it is doing and that it is doing it; such an organism is, at least primitively, conscious, although it may lack reflexive self-consciousness. Regulative processes, on the other hand, happen to the organism: the organism may become aware of its deter mination by them but they are not conscious. But all of this sits uncomfortably with accounts which, contrary to the interpretation of Boudreaux and also that of Richard Peters (1958), claim not only that Freud was positing unconscious intentions but that there is nothing incoherent in such a notion (Dilman, 1972;Hamlyn, 1971b; Maclntyre, 1958; Siegler, 1967). There is a direct contradiction here if "epistemic" is taken to be equivalent to "intentional." So let us examine the nature of this divergence with reference to one of Hamlyn's (1971b) examples of a case where, he believes, we are quite justified in claiming that somebody had an intention of which he was unconscious. This is the story of a man who habitually (57 times to date) tries to run over any cat which comes within range of his car, but who sincerely denies that he is trying to do any such thing. Here, Hamlyn argues, we not only have a case of unconscious intention (given a number of conditions) but perhaps a case where this is the only explanation open to us. What we may object to here is the apparent assumption that either a piece of behaviour is intentional or it is unintentional qua accidental: one reason why I had to distinguish be tween regulated directed behaviour and behaviour which is directed but epistemic 122</page><page sequence="17">Part Three was to avoid the consequences of such a simple bifurcation. Why must we call the man's action intentional? The action of swinging the steering wheel of the car in the direction of a peripheral furry object is, says Hamlyn, "complex and skilled enough for it to be implausible that it should be carried out unintention ally or by accident" (Hamlyn, 1971, p. 17). This is a very dubious empirical assumption ? especially in view of Reason's (1979) data covering the wide range of complex behaviour that people carry out unintentionally whilst thinking about something else. But, Hamlyn would reply, there was a definite regularity in the behaviour of the cat hitter. The answer is that the existence of this reg ularity can be explained by regulative learning processes which are only "in tentional" to the extent that they involve directed behaviour. To justify such an interpretation let us continue the flight of fancy by saying that the man had a cat-hating father and that, as a child, he was handicapped by an over powering need for parental approval. So during his childhood he came to treat the family cat cruelly in order to amuse his father, or rather he acquired a response-contingent association between acts such as pulling a cat's tail and ap proving parental smiles. Thus, in later life when stressed and feeling in need of nurture (Hamlyn does say that the man's wife is usually in the car!) he un consciously, directedly, but with no knowledge of what he is doing, acts as described. This is therefore a case of Drc behaviour. However, the matter is not as simple as this, for, as Hamlyn goes on to say, there are other cases which are better described as ones of self-deception, in which the past history of the individual leads us to believe that at one time the person knew the true characterization of his behaviour and feelings but that he has since systematically denied them to himself. The result is that he seems both to know and not know what he is doing. How can we accommodate such phenomena within the present account? Although such a "solution" may appear trite in view of the burgeoning and complex literature on self-deception, perhaps this paradoxical condition can be seen as a combination of immediate knowledge of the true state of affairs, which is primitively conscious, and a mediate false belief, which is self-conscious. Thus, at one time the agent had self-conscious knowledge of his own mendacious tendencies but in order to maintain his self esteem he inten tionally prevented himself from reflecting on them. In some cases this would result in apparent ignorance of his own behaviour; for example the life history of the cat hitter may have been other than described in that the man was at one time fully aware of his practices but had trained himself out of reflection on them. In this case his behaviour could be said to be immediately epistemic, primitively conscious but not self-conscious. Given that one function of re flection is memory the agent would have trained himself to "forget" the act as soon as it had been carried out; however, at the time he was primitively con scious of what he was doing. Such knowledge is not unconscious any more than my knowledge that Paris is the capital city of France is unconscious when I am not'thinking about it : the difference between the two cases of knowledge is that in the self-deception case the remembrance is prevented by habitial 123</page><page sequence="18">James Russell cognitive strategies for "protecting" the item of knowledge. In still other sit uations the agent may engage in redefinition of his behaviour by reflecting on it but in a deliberately inappropriate manner (see Hamlyn, 1971c; Martin, 1979); in which case again there need be no suggestion of unconscious intentions only that natural emotional reactions have been purposely inhibited and distorted. In sum, we can have (a) unconscious, directed, regulated behaviour, (b) epistemic behaviour which is primitively conscious as opposed to self-conscious, but not (c) unconscious and epistemic behaviour. There seems to be no inco herence in the notion of unconscious intentions if (a) and (b) are being indicated but a very real incoherence in the notion that the agent can do something which we must characterize as involving knowledge of environmental poten tialities whilst denying that the agent is conscious of what these environmental potentialities are. Perhaps some of the difficulty about Freud's original claims arises from a confusion between explaining how one course of action comes to be triggered or selected from a range of possibilities at an unconscious level and explaining the intentional performance of the action itself ? what is done as against how it is achieved. In humans, the former but not the latter can be explained by Freud's primary process* theory, by the current notion of four kinds of reg ulative processes and indeed by any theory which deals in, not even necessarily associative, causal processes. Indeed, the matter can be expressed without reference to consciousness by saying that people do not always, maybe not even typically, choose what they are going to do next and how they are going to react to an unexpected situation: that before the stage of knowing oneself as acting or reacting there is a relatively automatic phase in which the direction of behaviour is causally determined or canalized. Perhaps it is less paradoxical in literature than in psychology to assert this dual relevance to human behaviour of primitive associative processes on the one hand and consciousness on the other. No writer has described the shifting pano ramas of human consciousness more exhaustively than has Proust, and yet a major theme of his great novel is the determination of consciousness by asso ciations formed in the sometimes far distant past. He frequently characterizes his generalizations about human nature as being "psychological laws" of a mechanistic kind; and Beckett (1965: original publication, 1931) has com mented on the central role of habit in the novel. In much social intercourse, Proust implies, the very cognitive demands of creating a certain impression (and the resultant degree of arousal) makes acting from knowledge virtually impossible, and may result in atavistic associations determining social style. Thus, M. de Charlus on entering Mme. Verdurin's drawing room for the first time has warring within him a desire to show common politeness and to appear virile whilst at the same time demonstrating the coldest contempt for his social inferiors. With the cognitive decks thus cluttered, his passage across the floor is "molded" ? as in all similar occasions ? by a mental association with a distant female relative whose manner he then unconsciously apes. The autoshaped pigeon associates the key with food and thus pecks it; 124</page><page sequence="19">Part Three M. de Charlus associates the distant relative with dignity through moments of social crisis and thus imitates her. "Dsc" may be concise but in this context hardly as accurate as "the same law, which requires that life, in the interests of the still unfulfilled act, shall bring into play, utilize, adulterate, in perpetual prostitution, the most respectable, it may be the most sacred, sometimes only the most innocent legacies of the past" (Proust, 1968, v. 8; p. 74, original pub lication: 1918).
