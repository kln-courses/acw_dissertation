<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mechanism's Last Stand By Marvin M. Black Information Agent , Farm Credit Administration of New Orleans Somehow or other we feel that man has a greater r√¥le than that of mere spectator in the universe. There is a strangely unquenchable longing of the human spirit for the most exalted place and opportunity and scope in the universe inconsistent with the tenets of modern science. - Burtt : Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science, 1925. Conte MPOBAEY thought has ac- cepted uncritically the assumption of physical science, permeated with the teachings of medieval philosophy, and has been as dogmatic in upholding these outmoded doctrines as any theo- logian in upholding the tenets of his religious faith. Man no longer occupies the prominent place he once had in the cosmos - his hopes and ideals - once the all-controlling factors - have be- come mere sounding brass and tinkling cymbals, signifying nothing. Teleologi- cal explanation is taboo in the scientific world, while happenings in terms of the relations of things to human pur- pose are considered in the same light as belief in Santa Claus. The world of nature exists not that it might be en- joyed by man, but merely for the physicist to observe with his calculat- ing instruments ; the life of the organ- ism is no longer a mystery, but some- thing which the biological scientist has discovered in the test-tube. Indeed, man, today, in the opinion of the mechanists, is but the chance and temporary product of a blind and pur- poseless nature, a veritable intruder in her domain. His ideals, his hopes, his mystic raptures, are the creatures of his own imagination, having no place in a world of dancing atoms and conditioned reflexes. The laws of na- ture, inexorable in their application, grind slowly but surely to snuff out man's all too brief candle of life. One great cataclysm of nature, and, lo, he is gone like the chaff which the wind driveth away, and all that he has held dear becomes "buried in a universe of ruins." Unfortunately, this view has been accepted uncritically by many intellec- tuals who pride themselves on their learning and the up-to-dateness of their views. Such slavish adherence to the dogmas of an outmoded physics has not only poisoned the stream of philosophical thought, but has retarded the advance of scientific thinking by at- tempting to apply to human behavior the methods and language of the physi- cal sciences. The old Descartian dual- ism of mind vs. matter still prevails in high places, clouding the issues, and setting up as a guide a gloomy, deter- ministic philosophy that would make man ashamed of his very existence. Vaunting their "open-mindedness" and their "scientific attitude," our in- tellectuals have nonetheless refused to inquire into the foundations of such a belief, and have worshipped at the shrine of mechanism as devotedly as any savage before a primitive fetish. In truth, all our sciences have been dev- otees at this same shrine before which 22</page><page sequence="2">mechanism's last stand 23 Philosophy has also unhesitatingly kneeled, repeating a jargon which, too often, she has not understood. Recently, however, there have been encouraging signs that the foundations of Holy Mechanism are beginning to give way. Strange to say, the move- ment to overhaul traditional concep- tions of thinking in terms of physical science has not come from philosophy but from the biological sciences. Physics for some time has already re- pudiated the tenets of a purely mech- anistic doctrine, and has overhauled its teachings in the light of a broader experience. The radical physical hy- potheses of Einstein; the wo rid- view of such philosophers of science as Ed- dington, Jeans, and Whitehead, show- ing the inadequacy of a purely mech- anistic interpretation of the universe ; and the experiments of Millikan and others with cosmic rays - these are samples of happenings in the field of physical science that are prodding scientists into a healthy skepticism about the very foundations of their own beliefs. Biology, physiology, and psychol- ogy, following the lead of physics, are now beginning to question the atomis- tic and mechanistic preconceptions that have shackled them for two hun- dred years, and are tending to adopt a teleologica! interpretation of nature. Perhaps the most outstanding critic of present-day biology is J. H. Wood- ger, whose Biological Principles looses some telling darts at his mechanistic brethren. He shows that despite their loud protestations against the subjec- tive, or metaphysics, they are already up to their necks in it by their abstrac- tions of matter and mind. In attempt- ing to be entirely ' ' objective, ' ' they are flying in the face of the very founders of physical science, who emphasized theoretical aspects of their far-reach- ing discoveries. If they appeal to Gali- leo as the exponent of complete objec- tivity in science, they will find that he, too, stressed its philosophical aspects. Modern biologists, says Woodger, for- get that Galileo himself did not con- sider mathematical treatment of na- ture as the whole of reality, but re- garded it as a necessary abstraction [italics mine] for working purposes, lie did not regard color, smell, and other sensations as "unreal" just be- cause they constituted an obstacle to all tidy explanations of the world in terms of atoms. Yet, this has been re- garded as the type of scientific ex- planation par excellence. Thus, willy- nilly, science has slipped into meta- physics - the story of the pot and the kettle brought up to date! So anxious have the biologists been to escape any taint of metaphysics that they have shied at the use of the word, "organism," for fear they might be considered "unscientific, ' ' and have at- tempted to explain organic behavior in terms of mathematical physics. But, in the opinion of Woodger, the amount of biological knowledge amenable to treatment by mathematical physics is very small. We are no nearer the truth, says Woodger, "just because we try to interpret everything 'scientifical- ly.' " Biological scientists of today have criticized the church for its at- tack upon Galileo in the Middle Ages, and yet they are adopting exactly the same procedure as that of the ecclesi- astics of old. They attacked Galileo not because of his hostility to the church, Woodger argues, but because he was challenging a well-entrenched system of thought. As the ecclesiastics of his day were tied to preconceived ideas of the world, which they did not want dis- turbed, so today, our high priests of biological science oppose the new ways of thinking because they have been trained to the older notions. For them to accept new ideas is as difficult a men- tal process as it was for the church- men in the days of Galileo. Small won-</page><page sequence="3">24 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOE JANTJAEY, 1935 der, then, that biology today is finding it difficult to break loose from the bonds of mechanism. The contention among the old and new schools of thought in biology is typical of the situation which prevails among all schools of opposing thought where each claims a monopoly on truth. The mechanist bases his claims on a long series of past triumphs and upon his 'objective' observations. He ac- cuses the vitalist of prejudice and 'sub- jective' factors, never dreaming that he may have a beam in his own eye. The dogmatic vitalist, on the other hand, contends that living things, in- explicable on mechanistic terms, be- long to a different order of being. Each eyes the other with suspicion, and can not understand the other. The mecha- nist thinks the vitalist an emotionalist, a dreamer of shallow mind ; the vitalist concludes his opponent is a man of crude sensibilities, who will not see the truth. And all the time the differ- ence between these views rests on dif- ferences of opinion about the correct interpretation of what is given in ex- perience. Having already made up their minds in advance about the "problems of life," there is no profit in discussion, and a stalemate is reached. But, in Woodger's opinion, neither has a monopoly on truth, and both schools need to understand that a true science of biology will follow whatever method affords a means to new discoveries, not closing its mind by the acceptance of either dogmatic vitalism or an equally dogmatic mech- anism. In the field of physiology, the mech- anistic hypothesis is likewise defi- nitely on the down-grade. Recent in- vestigations have proved that organic activity can not be explained merely in terms of structural behavior, but is part of a coordinated whole. "The mechanistic theory is therefore bank- rupt," says J. S. Haldane, in his Science and Philosophy, "and has ceased to interest contemporary physi- ologists." In his opinion, the actual de- velopments of ordinary physiological investigation have carried physiologi- cal knowledge to a point where the mechanistic speculations of the last century are inadequate in the under- standing of life. "But a little con- sideration is sufficient to show us that from the very beginning there was not the slightest prospect for a complete, systematic treatment of biology as part of physics and chemistry." Answering the argument of the mechanists who hold that the struc- tural machinery of organic life goes on reproducing itself indefinitely, he states that the more structure and chemical complication we actually dis- cover, or assume, in the organism, the more hopeless does the problem of its reproduction and maintenance become from a mechanistic standpoint. The very structure which the mechanists maintain is reproduced mechanically is not explicable in terms of mechan- istic theory. They fail to take account of the coordination, which can be traced in the activities of living organ- isms from the earliest stages of its life- history. This coordination is of such a nature that the organism's normal structure and activities are maintained and reproduced. All the definite mechanical structures - skin, bones, lungs, etc. - are maintained by coordi- nated activity for which there is no mechanical explanation. "The fact of such coordinated maintenance and re- production may not be evident to philosophers and theologians," Hal- dane adds, "but it is forced to the at- tention of medical men." All the more significant that scientists themselves do recognize this important fact ! Haldane decries the attempts of the mechanists to draw hard and fast lines between structure and activity of the organism, for in the organic world of</page><page sequence="4">mechanism's last stand 25 life, structure and activity cannot be separated from one another. Between living structure and its environment, we can draw no distinct line as we seem able to draw between an inorganic body and its environment. We can only regard the parts as organized manifes- tations of a persistent whole - the co- ordination of structure and activity in the very essence of life. Once for all, says he, we must firmly take up the position that for biology, the Newton- ian philosophy is an impossible scien- tific basis, since it does not correspond with what is visible and tangible in the organic world. It has been said that what Haldane is asking physiologists to give up is not their methods of investigation - which are the same as his - but the intellect- ual background of na√Øve materialism. He is asking them, in the words of Pro- fessor Whitehead, "to become philo- sophical and enter into a thorough criticism of their own foundations." The physiologists have prided them- selves on being "objective" in their interpretation of matter, thinking themselves far above metaphysics, when as a matter of fact by conceiving matter as bits of stuff pushing each other about they are head over heels in subjective thinking. They have been taking matter as ultimate, without knowing its meaning, and have been trying to make the facts of the organ- ism fit this notion, although physics has long since thrown overboard this metaphysical abstraction. It is a mistaken idea to believe, says Haldane, that because science has cleared away many mysteries in the world, that our experience has become much more intelligible than that of our forefathers' day. But in so thinking, we forget that each scientific advance seems only to throw into clearer relief the mystery which remains. The ad- vance of scientific knowledge does not seem to make either our universe, or our life in it any less mysterious. In proportion as we know more and think more, scientific problems still unsolved seem to define themselves progressive- ly. The biological, the physical, the me- chanical conceptions are all necessary to interpret experience, but each is only part of the whole - reality must include them all. Another instance of the crumbling foundations of mechanism is found in the popularity enjoyed by the theory of "creative evolution" as explana- tion of the origin of life from lifeless matter. This doctrine has done much to alter traditional ways of thinking in the biological sciences, and in the opin- ion of Hurst ( Mechanism of Creative Evolution) , one of its chief exponents, constitutes definite evidence of the fu- tility of purely mechanistic explana- tions of organic life. He believes that the discovery of the gene as the unit of life and creative evolution has, through experimental genetics, laid the foundations of an exact science of experimental evolution. ' ' These funda- mental developments in biology, when they become generally known," says he, "will naturally cause considerable changes of view in' the kindred branches of physiology, pathology, bio- chemistry, biophysics, taxonomy, and phylogeny, and eventually in the more remote realm of philosophy." Despite the statement of Huxley in the nineteenth century that if we had sufficient data we could predict the ap- pearance of flora and fauna thousands of years in the future, it is impossible to predict the precise nature of future species owing to the indeterminate na- ture of mutations and transmutations. It is at this point, says Hurst, that scientific determinism breaks down. Deterministic and mechanistic evolu- tion of the nineteenth century, with its closed circuits and endless cycles, is al- together too inadequate to account for creative evolution with its novelty and</page><page sequence="5">26 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR JANUARY, 1935 progressiveness. Besides, says Hurst, "if we replace the biological unit of creative evolution - the genetical spe- cies - by the wider philosophical units of creative evolution - matter, life, mind - the inadequacy of determinism becomes even more marked. No deter- ministic system, scientific or philo- sophical, could possibly have predicted life from matter, or mind from life and matter." It may be in the principle of indeter- minancy, adds Hurst, that we come up against the reality behind our man- made laws of nature. Our human geo- metrical minds work naturally in terms of mechanism and the determinate re- sults of cause and effect - anything outside that seems unreal to the human conceptual mind. Hence, this indeter- minancy may, indeed, be a universal principle of thought behind and be- yond our human conceptions and laws of mechanistic determinism. This seems to involve a prime thinker and creator outside man 's own creation. In this respect adds Hurst, modem scien- tific speculation returns to the ideas of Plato [italics mine] who taught that in creation, time and space came into be- ing at the same instant, so that if they ever were to dissolve, they might be dissolved together - an interesting an- ticipation of Einstein's demonstration of the inseparability of space and time. Continuing this line of thought Hurst argues as follows: "The great principle of indeterminancy in nature thus may be tentatively interpreted as the natural mode of action and mani- festation of pure thought or spirit in matter-life-mind, while determinism, which is nonetheless real, represents an inner and secondary principle, based on the geometrical mode of ac- tion of the human mind. It may be that the discovery in our time of scientific indeterminancy and relativity fore- shadows the coming of the next great step in the creative evolution of mind far above the present concept." In the genetical evolution of mind through life and matter, Hurst believes there are definite indications that mind is gradually increasing its influence as creative evolution proceeds, while mat- ter - the oldest of the three - is gradu- ally losing its influence. By the exer- cise of the human mind, human selec- tion is gradually replacing natural se- lection in many respects. He does not doubt but that, through the applica- tions of experimental science, man, as times goes on, will be able more and more to control and change his en- vironment, and his conditions of life as well as those of her organisms. Man's increasing control over matter is due almost entirely to the exercise of his conceptual mind in scientific ex- periments. In his Modem Materialism and Emergent Evolution, McDougall holds views on the causal efficacy of mind similar to those of Hurst in the above, although not agreeing with him in every particular. He takes other emer- gent evolutionists to task because they have left out mind in the evolutionary process. This is due, says McDougall, to their attempt to divert public atten- tion from the problem of causes, with concentration merely on the fact that evolution has occurred. They are not so sure as they once were on the causes of evolution, and are aware that they have no answer consistent with mod- ern materialism and its purely mech- anistic principles. A few still claim to find a complete answer in Darwin's principle of natural selection working upon innumerable variations, but these few, says McDougall, "are a laggard remnant. ' ' The most outstanding exponent of purposivism in psychology today, Wil- liam McDougall, in his contribution to the Psychologies of 1930, scores American psychologists for their com- plete blindness to the most peculiar, characteristic, and important feature of human activity, its goal-seeking.</page><page sequence="6">mechanism's last stand 27 They have regarded all bodily actions and phases of experience as mechani- cal reactions to stimuli, and all learn- ing as the modification of such reac- tions by the principle of association. Now, happily, all this is changed, he adds - the animal psychologists have begun to realize that any description of animal behavior which ignores its goal-seeking is futile, any "explana- tion which ignores motivation, grossly misleading; they are busy with the study of 'drives,' 'sets,' and 'incen- tives.' " It is true that their recogni- tion of goal-seeking is generally par- tial and grudging, but recognize its effi- cacy they must. Much the same state of affairs, he says, prevails in current American writings on human psychology. Its problems are no longer discussed, ex- periments are no longer made with total and bland disregard for the pur- posive nature of human activity. The terms, "set," "drive," and "incen- tive," having been found indispens- able in animal psychology, are allowed to appear in discussions of human problems, in spite of their anthropo- morphic implications; "prepotent re- flexes," "motives," "drives," "pre- ponderant propensities," "impulses toward ends," "fundamental urges," and even "purposes" now figure in the texts. "Partial, half-hearted, reluctant as is still the recognition of purposive activity, it may, I think," says Mc- Dougall, "fairly be said that only the crude behaviorists now ignore it com- pletely - that with that exception, American psychology has become pur- posive, in the sense that it no longer ignores or denies the goal-seeking na- ture of human and animal action, but accepts it as a problem to be faced. ' ' According to McDougall, mechani- cal causation has no leg to stand on today. During the nineteenth century, under the prevalence of the faith that strictly mechanical or Newtonian causation was adequate to the explana- tion of all events of the inanimate world, it was natural enough to regard such causation as the only type of na- turalistic causation, and, therefore, to class intrinsic teleological causation with the extrinsic teleological causa- tion of the theologians as supernatural. But now, says McDougall, when it has become clear that faith or hope was il- lusory, and that we have no insight into the nature of mechanistic causa- tion, this ground for repudiating inter- nal teleological causation has been taken away, and none remains. The remaining prejudice against teleological causation, however, is more than a hang-over from the days of belief in strictly mechanical or New- tonian causation. To accept the teleo- logical causation of human agents is to believe in the causal efficacy of psychi- cal events. Psychologists have felt that to do this would be to commit them- selves to psychophysical dualism or animism, and thus offend against the theory of continuity of evolution of the organic from the inorganic, and the common preference for a monistic world-view. If scientists still shy at psychical interpretation, however, adds McDougall, there are two monis- tic theories, both implying continuity of evolution, that have been accepted both by philosophers and men of science - psychic monism and emer- gent evolution. The psychic monism, of Paulsen, Morton Prince, C. A. Strong, Durant Drake, and L. T. Troland, explains Mc- Dougall, has no ground for doubting the causal efficacy of psychic events - teaching that all events are psychic. The emergent theory is equally com- patible with, and in fact, asserts the causal efficacy of psychic events and the continuity of organic with inor- ganic evolution. It is a monistic theory, and hence fulfills all the requirements of the psychologist unable to blind himself to the reality of goal-seeking behavior and purposive activity, yet</page><page sequence="7">28 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR JANUARY, 1935 must cling to monism and continuity of evolution. This theory, incidentally, is now in excellent standing, being spon- sored by such outstanding thinkers as S. Alexander, L. T. Hobhouse, Lloyd Morgan, H. S. Jennings, R. B. Perry, and W. M. Wheeler. "With these alternatives open to the choice of the psychologist," adds Mc- Dougall, "he has no valid ground for denying the causal efficacy of psychic activity in the natural world, no ground for continuing to regard internal tele- ological causation as supernatural, and therefore no ground for blinding him- self to the purposive nature of human activity." Like McDougall, Morton Prince, in his "Fundamental Errors of Be- haviorists," (Psychologies of 1930) has sharply criticized the tenets of be- haviorism. Their fundamental error, says he, consists in the denial of con- sciousness as a cause of bodily reac- tion. He challenges the behaviorists in a criminal trial, to argue the murder- er's case before a judge, making the plea that, being an automaton, his "criminal intent" had nothing to do with his criminal act - that it was his neurones, or his ductless glands, or his conditioned reflexes that did the crime. Imagine the judge's reply! Why did not the counsel for Loeb and Leopold put a behaviorist on the stand as an expert in psychology? Because, says Prince, "the whole of criminal law and criminal responsibil- ity is based on 'criminal intent' - the doctrine that consciousness is the cause of bodily actions - the seal of 'criminal responsibility.' " So with the motives of sympathy that move us to give money to beggars, those that lead us to write, study, and do the mul- titude of other daily acts - purely auto- matic! Nonsense, says Prince. A second fundamental error of be- haviorists, in Prince's opinion, is to suppose that behavior today can be completely explained in terms of the correlated neural and other bodily processes alone. We do not have even the rudimentary knowledge that will allow us to follow the reactions to any stimulus beyond the afferent recep- tors, through the cerebral pathways that are correlated with mental experi- ences. He reduces the argument to the absurd by the example of going to mar- ket to buy one's dinner, showing how impossible it is to trace the path of all the stimuli that determine one's choice of purchases. The third error of the behaviorists, he says, is in confining themselves to only one method - the objective meth- od, that of the physical sciences. The physicist himself, however, he main- tains, has recognized that there is a point beyond which he cannot go, for example when he reaches the problem of ultimate energy, of the electron. Yet he does not close his mind to other methods, but tries anything else that will help him solve his problem. So it is with the problems of the medical and biological sciences. They should not adopt one method to the exclusion of all others. Plainly, different problems require different methods, according to their nature. So when the behaviorists inquire into the problems of psychology, one may ask, is the objective method ade- quate to resolve completely the prob- lems involving consciousness? When he follows the "adequate stimulus" beyond the sensory receptors, does he not run up against a stone wall, or lose himself in a jungle? The behaviorist 's prize exhibit of purely mechanical action is that of emotion, a heredity-pattern-reaction, or mechanism. But, asks Prince, is this a complete explanation? Will the dis- covery of any particular visceral, glandular, or other bodily process in connection with particular behavior, explain the why of the behavior which subjectively appears to be not mechan- istic but purposive? Why in one situa-</page><page sequence="8">mechanism's last stand 29 tion the individual withdraws from a given stimulus, in another, examines it intently, in another embraces, accord- ing as he experiences a sentiment of aversion, curiosity, or affection? In other words, there would seem to be something over and above the visceral (etc.) processes, and which is of the order of consciousness - a part of the reaction that enters into the causal change of events, from stimulus to be- havior. The Gestalt psychologists, while un- willing to admit openly the causal effi- cacy of mind, or purpose or explana- tion of behavior, have nevertheless furnished excellent evidence of the part that intelligent, purposive be- havior plays in the acts of some of the lower and higher animals. The classi- cal illustration of this fact is in the ex- periments carried on by Kohler with anthropoid apes. Despite the state- ments of the behaviorist that conscious- ness should have no place in the de- scription of animal behavior, he shows definitely that it is impossible to leave it out. He can not agree with Watson in his method of condemning all diffi- cult-looking problems in the nervous system as pure mysticism and after- effects of the introspection time. That gives a simple science with only a few concepts; but, says he, "a good deal of the world of behavior and its prob- lems does not occur in this science." If we observe the faces of anthropoid apes, of monkeys, and of dogs, we get the impression that those faces show very different degrees of 'understand- ing' or 'insight.' Observation of the animals in action and experimentation on them prove, says he, "that our ex- pectation was justified, at least with regard to the high place we would tend to give to the apes." ("Intelligence in Apes," Psychologies of 1925.) Kohler's experiments seem to prove that the ape not only shows memory, but actual insight into the solution of a problem, all of a sudden hitting upon the right solution, which could have not been derived from any previous trial and error method. Clever apes can be taught even to differentiate colors by proper rewards, and even fish have been known to react in the same way. Try as they will, says Kohler, the behaviorists can not get around using anthropomorphic terms to describe behavior. When we say an ape looks "interested," or he "observes," he means exactly that - for to observe a thing in every day life has a perfectly objective meaning, a certain visible and characteristic behavior towards something. ' ' To describe merely the contraction of all the muscles which are employed when the chemist, the policeman, or a chimpanzee 'looks interested' would be beyond my forces," says Kohler. If we restrict one meaning of these terms to behavior, he adds, "our description of behavior would become extremely poor, not more than a meager rest of the concrete world of behavior would be accepted in our science; and our theoretical concepts would very soon be exactly as poor and meager as our material." Mechanistic interpretation of hu- man behavior is fighting a losing battle not only in the fields of biology, physi- ology, and psychology, but in the field of medicine as well. As shown by Dr. John Eathbone Oliver, in his Psychia- try and Mental Health, medicine, once the supporter of purely mechanistic behavior, has at last come to recognize the fact that human ills can best be treated if the physician knows some- thing of the patient as an individual - how he reacts to certain stimuli, his mental habits, and his particular train of thought that makes him a separate personality. Only a short time ago, says Dr. Oliver, the average physician was a pure materialist, interested in nothing he could not perceive through the senses. Since the mind was not ap-</page><page sequence="9">30 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOB JANUARY, 1935 proachable in this wise, he waived it aside as non-essential, or else shut it up in a water-tight compartment for the alienist to examine. Medical books of the early Victorian period contained little about the influence of the mind on bodily symptoms, but today one can hardly pick up a book on medicine that does not stress the important influence of mental elements in disease. "Christian Science, like the early heresies of Christendom," says Dr. Oliver, "developed as a protest against a neglect of the mental ele- ments in disease and as an illogical em- phasis upon the influence of 'mind over matter. ' But modern medicine is learning its lesson." He indicates that remarkable changes have taken place in the treatment of patients: Instead of lumping together patients with the same kind of disease indiscriminately - tuberculosis patients in one group; cardiac patients in another, kidney dis- ease patients in still another, etc. - each patient is treated according to his particular reaction to the disease. Vic- tims of tuberculosis for example, may be two very divergent personalities, with different strains of heredity, brought up in different environments, trained according to varying habit-f or- mations, and exposed to different sources of mental and physical stress. Where one may have a spot of lessened resistance, the other may have an un- broken wall of defense, hence each re- acts in different ways. Therefore, says Dr. Oliver, "until the doctor knows each as a personality [italics mine], until he has a detailed knowledge of his heredity, family history, childhood, adolescence, manhood - until he can get inside his mind, and can reach some general idea of just how and why he has become what he is, the physician can not treat the case intelligently." According to Dr. Oliver, there are groups of clinical associations of phy- sicians today who are specialized diag- nosticians. Every patient who consults them is examined meticulously with every possible aid of modern science. Each patient, besides the general rou- tine tests, is sent to various specialists, and finally to the psychiatrist. They go to the psychiatrist he says, not because the examining doctors suspect mental illness, but because a final diagnosis and adequate recommendations for treatment are not usually possible without "a personality analysis," a general picture of the patient's mental anatomy and pathology. The general diagnostician learns from the psychia- trist not only what kind of man the pa- tient is, but how he came to be what he is now, and how he has become habitu- ated to react to the ordinary stimuli of every-day life in certain definite ways. An outstanding illustration of this new attitude of physician to patient, says Dr. Oliver, is furnished by a re- cent paper of Dr. Thomas Ordway, Dean of Albany Medical College, il- lustrating the vital importance of the personal relationship between physi- cian and patient in the practice of medicine. Dr. Ordway says: "The whole problem of diagnosis and treat- ment depends upon your insight into the patient's character and personal life, and in every case of organic dis- ease there are complex interactions be- tween the pathological process and the intellectual process which you must ap- preciate and consider. Disease in man is never exactly the same as disease in an experimental animal, for in man the disease at once affects and is affected by what we call the emotional life. Thus, the physician who attempts to take care of a patient, while he neg- lects this factor, is as unscientific as the investigator who neglects to con- trol all the conditions that may affect his experiment." It is a most interesting fact that the teachings of biology, physiology, psy- chology, and medicine today tie in with</page><page sequence="10">mechanism's last stand 31 the tenets of contemporary idealistic philosophy. In the words of Professor Clifford Barrett, one of its most out- standing exponents in America, "Idealism is no longer a creed, but an attitude, a way of interpreting human experience : a living tradition, not a re- ligious veneration of accumulated philosophical dogmas." Indeed, with the striking changes that have taken place in traditional ways of thinking in the various sciences, the hard and fast lines between "idealism" and "ma- terialism" have passed. The idealist is deeply interested in the attitudes and results of both the physical and social sciences. He is ready to respect any serious philosophical account of the physical world. But, says Clifford, "He can not take seriously the bor- rowed glory which any interpretation appropriates to its conclusions from the scientific demonstrability of the data which it endeavors to synthesize and explain. ' ' Idealistic philosophy is no opponent of physiological psychology or of the objective method in experimental in- vestigation, nor does the idealist phi- losopher argue whether this type of ex- planation provides a valid account of certain aspects of rational life. But he denies that it can offer a complete or adequate account of all its aspects. No adequate account of the world, says Professor Clifford, can neglect such an important datum as "spirit." The world is intelligible to man because its order is also the order of his rational life. In his opinion, spirit and me- chanics are not genuine antagonists, for it is only in the service of purposes and values that the "mechanical" may win significance. In this wise, the trend of thinking in the various sciences is linked up with the philosophy of value. Man is aware of values because he has the capacity to realize in intelligent life, the order of universal nature. As its physical processes participate in his bodily life, so his reason, appreciation and evalua- tion constitute the regulative ones. Ac- cording to present-day idealist philo- sophy, man's interpretative activities may be based upon a system of mean- ings and values which in kind are one with the regulative principles of the cosmic order out of which they arise, and to which they provide the key to man's knowledge. It is in the signifi- cance which both pragmatism and idealism attribute to values in human knowledge that they are drawn closest together. Through the idea of value, a philos- ophy of mind is developing, which may again introduce a unity of prin- ciple into the theory of mind. Today, philosophy and psychology seem to be returning to the classical conceptions of mind emphasized by Aristotle and Hegel, while the increasing influence of the notions connected with Gestalt pre- sage the reinstatement in modern garb of essentially idealistic conceptions since Kant. At the present time, we are no longer content with a merely "ex- planatory" psychology, but are de- manding a cultural psychology that takes into account all of the vital fac- tors that make of the individual a com- plete personality. Thus, today, there is a decided trend toward a conception of nature that would give to mind its rightful place as a controller of events. "The universe," says Jeans, "seems in the modern scientific view, to be nearer to a great thought than to a great machine. It may well be, that each individual consciousness is a brain cell in a universal mind. ' ' As a method of study, mechanism is invaluable, but the fault has been in the attempts of our scientists to claim for it a monopoly of interpretation of the facts of human behavior.

The heavens declare the glory of God and opportunity for astronomers, but they declare neither exclusively. The attempt of scientists to divide the world into separate halves of mind and matter has been responsible for much of the confused thinking that prevails today. On this point, the remarks of Wil- liam James in his "Sentiment of Ra- tionality," several decades ago, are equally applicable today: "It is a most peculiar twist of the human mind that our so-called 'scientific men' scoff at the use of faith, or introspection, which is in reality the basis of their own dis- coveries. The necessity of faith as an ingredient in our own mental attitude is strongly insisted upon by the scien- tific philosophers of the present, but by a singularly arbitrary caprice, they say it is only legitimate when used in the interests of one particular proposi- tion - that the course of nature is uni- form. With regard to all other possible truths, however, a number of our most influential contemporaries think that an attitude of faith is not only illogical, but shameful." Paraphrasing his well-known query to the mechanists of his day, we may challenge our contemporary worship- ers of mechanism somewhat as fol- lows: Why does Watson fearlessly proclaim his belief in the conditioned reflex theory of life, although the "proofs" before him are the same which makes McDougall reject it? Why does he believe in purely mechanical acts that for Haldane are guided by the organism as a whole? Simply be- cause, as James remarked, "like every human being of the slightest mental originality, he is peculiarly sensitive to evidence that bears in some direc- tion. ' ' Despite their protestations against the use of "faith" and the subjective in investigation, the mechanists find they can not get along without it. Faith is synonymous with working hypothe- sis, and with it must come "conscious- ness," which the behaviorists would in vain rule out of human activity. But careful experimentation among ani- mals by leading biological scientists has shown conclusively that there is such a thing as consciousness, guiding and directing behavior. Contrary to the theory of the behaviorist, we do not sit passive in our environment, but are active agents in it, shaping it to suit our ends. Mind comes into existence when the activity of the organism upon its environment shows that such action has been done with foresight of ends. We would have to deny the very exist- ence of organic action, says Everett Dean Martin, "if in the interest of mechanism we say that this world is so organized that an animal, conscious of pleasure and pain, can not set going certain bodily movements that make for one, and avoid the other. In other words, that the animal has no choice." Mechanism is still fighting hard to hold the field, but there are unmistak- able signs that it is making its last stand. Various theories of creative evolution and "orthogenesis" are the order of the day, even among the simon-pure scientists. Renewed inter- est in the possibility of Lamarckian transmission of acquired characters is attracting the attention of leading physiologists and experimental psy- chologists ; such leaders of biology here in America as Lillie, Herrick, and Jennings, join Professors Woodger and Haldane abroad in calling aloud for the recognition of a "more be- yond" in physico-chemical behavior, while the writings of McDougall and Morton Prince are typical of the close agreement today between a purposive psychology and practical medicine in the fashioning of human behavior and treatment of human ills.</page><page sequence="12">mechanism's last stand 33 To the scientists of today therefore, who still cling to the banner of mechan- istic theory, may we cite these words of William James: "These most con- scientious gentlemen think that they have jumped off their own feet - eman- cipated their mental operations from the control of their subjective propen- sities in toto. But they are deluded. They have simply chosen from among the entire set of propensities at their command . . . the meanest, lowest, arid- est, result - namely, the bare molecular world - and have sacrificed all the rest." Is it not indeed strange that men of science, although perceiving clearly that the power of foreseeing the future course of events has steadily devel- oped through biological evolution, be- coming in man his most striking char- acteristic, yet persistently deny that this consciousness, this intelligent foresight of ends, is meaningless in our every-day lives? It is only because, blinded by the fanaticism of objectiv- ity, they see in the noblest works of man only a response to mechanical stimuli, and, with the fire of religious zeal would strike down all of those heretics who refuse to bow down and worship the god of "Scientific Truth," who commands "Thou shall not be a purposivist !
