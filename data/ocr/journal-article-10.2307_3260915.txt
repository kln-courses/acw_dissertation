Nor was it an esoteric, secret exegetical tradition: that was simply "legend" and "fiction" (pp. 140, 183). Perhaps, it was an association between Ezekiel's "foot of a calf" and the Golden Calf (pp. 53-55, 158, 185). Or, perhaps it was some non-rabbinic, or peripherally rabbinic, mystical or esoteric tradition (p. 184). The study is masterful and I think that, for the time being, Halperin is right: we cannot know more from these sources. David R. Blumenthal Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322 L'Hypostase des Archontes: Traite gnostique sur l'origine de l'homme, du monde et des Archontes (NH 11,4), by Bernard Barc, and Norea (NH IX,2), by Michel Roberge. Bibliotheque copte de Nag Hammadi, Section "Textes," 5. Quebec/Louvain: Universite Laval/Peeters, 1980. Pp. xii+173. $20. This fifth volume in the French larrguage series of editions of Nag Hammadi texts, edited by J. E. Menard for the Laboratoire d'Histoire Religieuse at Laval University, contains two separate works. In the first, Bernard Barc presents a detailed commentary on Hypostasis of the Archons (NHC II 4), which he reads with admirable consistency and sympathy. In seeking to discover the text's internal logic and to capture the nuances of this particular version of gnostic creation myth, he has produced the kind of well-focused commentary of which all the Nag Hammadi texts are so much in need. As such, the commentary serves as an insightful introduc- tion to the complexities of studying the Hypostasis of the Archons, ranging from the identifica- tion of the understood antecedents of ambiguous pronouns to the interpretation of gnostic symbolism. In Barc's opinion, the text was not meant, even in antiquity, for the uninitiated. This inherent obscurity makes it all the more necessary for the modern interpreter to approach the text well-versed in related literature. Even so, Barc finds that the text cannot be made internally consistent. This inconsistency has led Barc, like others before him, to resort to a source analysis. His analysis (pp. 1-48) is well-reasoned and merits close attention, for if he is correct, it may be possible to evaluate Hypostasis of the Archons still more precisely as evidence for the geneal- ogy of "gnosticism," and of "Sethian gnosticism" in particular. Three sources are distinguished, two of them by means of clearly presented comparisons of Hypostasis of the Archons to related sections of On the Origin of the World (NHC II 5) and Apocryphon of John (NHC II 1): (1) An Anthropogonic Outline, narrating the creation of Adam and the births of Cain, Abel, and Seth, which can be compared with formally similar outlines preserved in rabbinic literature. Hyp. Arch. 87:11-92:18 (glosses excepted; see below) was composed by expanding this outline with (2) True Genesis, a gnostic version of Genesis 1-6, of which the canonical version could be regarded as a falsified paraphrase. The anthropogonic section of Hypostasis of the Archons thus formed is introduced and followed by sections draw- ing on (3) a Theogonic Source, dealing with the history of the material universe prior to the creation of Adam. A brief resume of this source (86:26-87:11) introduces the anthropogonic section, and the source in its entirety forms part (94:4-96:11) of the concluding dialogue between Norea and the Great Angel (Eleleth). Barc suggests that the text thus composed was a sectarian manual meant for use by an initiate as an aide-memoire in expounding the sect's doctrine. The author was a "gnostic Jew" intent on attracting adherents to his sect from among those faithful to "official Judaism." Barc suggests, with little argumentation, or speculation on the historical significance of such a text, that this original version of Hypostasis of the Archons may have been composed in Alexandria, possibly early in the second century.</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE But according to Barc's analysis, Hypostasis of the Archons in its surviving form is a chris- tianized edition, probably of the late second century. To this latter editor are due the introduc- tory quotation from Eph 6:12 (86:20-25), five interpolations (87:14-23, 88:6-11, 90:34-91:3, 91:7-11, 93:25-32), a number of reinterpretations of the Theogonic Source (94:4-96:17 passim; most of the text's present internal inconsistency can be explained as due to these reinterpreta- tions), and the conclusion (96:17-97:21). The main thrust of this redaction is to show that all of the primordial events occurred "in accordance with the will of the Father of the All," whose desire is to repossess the Light now trapped in the material world. For the redactor, the time for this repossession has come with the appearance (predicted by Eleleth to Norea) of the Per- fect Man (= Christ?). The Coptic text provided by Bare (accompanied by a fresh translation) is basically that established by B. Layton (HTR 67 [1974] 397-425; 69 [1976] 33); significant divergences (of doubtful utility at 87:27-28) are signalled by Bare on p. 49. There are a number of minor inaccuracies in the transcription (mostly in the representation of articulation marks and supra- linear strokes); the most serious is in 94:20, where emnts should be emntes. The work concludes w ith a word index to the Coptic text. The contribution to the volume by Michel Roberge (pp. 149-71) is the editio princeps of Norea (NHC IX 2, untitled in the Coptic \Iss). His edition (accompanied by a translation) makes a good beginning with this rather poorly preserved and apparently poorly transmitted text. The critical apparatus contains detailed descriptions of the extant traces of uncertain letters, though one could wish also for simple lists of other paleographically admissible interpre- tations of these traces. The edition is followed by a commentary mainly concerned with estab- lishing the Coptic text. A word index is also provided. In his introduction, Roberge makes valuable observations concerning the text's dramatis personae and underlying myth. He argues that the text is a poetically structured hymn cele- brating Norea as a mediator of saving knowledge. But I would take issue with his presentation of the opening invocation as an utterance of Norea. This analysis is based on a dubious transla- tion of 27:21-22: "C'est Nor6a qui cr[ie ve]rs eux." More immediately obvious and compelling would be, "Norea, who [cries out] to them," making Norea but the last of the personages invoked. A\ comparison of Roberge's edition with the ARE-UNESCO Facsimile Edition and with the recent edition of the text by B. A. Pearson and S. Giversen (NHS 15) makes it clear that students of this difficult and fascinating text must be prepared to work critically as Coptic philologists.
