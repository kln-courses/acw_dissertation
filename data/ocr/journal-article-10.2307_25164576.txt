Particularity Applied to the tonal language of common-practice music, Arendt's words neatly capture a dialectical relationship between invention and the collective assumptions of a cultural context. Tonality stands not as natural law, but as a broadly accepted artifice of human construction. The artistic act in this context reifies an artificially closed universe?the sub</page><page sequence="2">The Music of Morris Rosenzweig 173 jectivity of the creative act is subjugated to the 'objective artifice' of tonality. In a global society, tonal artifice can hardly be seen as an abso lute. Its objectivity rests within the musical horizon, rather than standing for it. Given the cultural and musical pluralism of our time, there is noth ing in the way of common practice (or shared cultural understanding) that can approach the monolithic versimilitude of tonality's closed sys tem. Despite the persistence of various ideologies, establishing a contex tually defined substitute for common practice becomes an inescapable task for today's composer. Drawing from Arendt: understanding the nor mative boundaries of tonality as mere artifice within the vast musical horizon does not remove the necessity of its dialectical function. We are not now faced with the indifference of nature, nor can we ever be. The contemporary composer is likely to approach this problem in ways largely dependent on individual circumstance. In Morris Rosenzweig's case, a number of factors are brought to bear: his native New Orleans, his background as a horn player and conductor, the popular music of his generation, and the aesthetics of musical modernism. No single influence is completely determinative. As a student of Mario Davidovsky at Columbia in the 1980s, Rosenzweig absorbed aspects of Davidovsky's characteristically nimble, immaculately crafted style, but at the same time he maintained an individual voice. Where Davidovsky is preoccupied more with the fundamental building blocks of sound (a by-product of his electronic-studio days) Rosenzweig releases his instrumental writing, allowing more sustained prototypical actions. Yet a similarly colorful, anthropomorphic quality is distinctly salient in both composers' music. Rosenzweig shares traits with another inimitable modernist, Stefan Wolpe. Describing Wolpe's gestural language, Christopher Hasty invokes the term particularity, "the creation of luminous moments alive with individual, particular character."1 His characterization resonates with Adorno's notion of contingent particularity, individual moments being "part of the totality of the work that opposes totality."2 Wolpe's distinc tive compositions evolve in an incessant process of self-opposition, a quality found in Rosenzweig's music. Events are conceived as multidi mensional objects with a high degree of autonomy. Pitch and rhythm coordinate symbiotically, maximizing the uniqueness and purposefulness of events in contrast with others. Properties of texture, phrase structure, and similar character-defining attributes apply more forcefully to individ ual, particular events than to any overall, concerted behavior. A multiplic ity of self-certain, contradictory events characterizes the surface, as opposed to a unitary texture of continuous gesturing. These contradic tions, forming as they do the substance of musical action, continuously act in opposition to the larger continuity?Adorno's state of totality in</page><page sequence="3">174 Perspectives of New Music opposition to itself. But as will be observed, attributes which pervade an entire work, those technical elements promoting the overall coherence and continuity, are a special preoccupation of Rosenzweig's?for the viv idness of particular events depends not only on distinctive, momentary qualities, but on the degree to which events protrude from a backdrop of normative action.

It seems a strange way to pro ceed after the opening figure. Yet in the quirky, rustic manner of the first two particular events, the territory for what is to be 'normative' in this piece is marked out.

As the bass clarinet perks up in 11, a new particularity emerges (12-9). The violin and bass clarinet, with similar but uncoordinated rhythms, act in unruly opposi tion to the pulse. Together they blurt out a complete musical sentence, divided into three segments, punctuated by the viola/strings. In the vio lin, the first and third segments begin and end with B. The middle seg ment begins with D but ends on B. In the bass clarinet, segmentation is marked by brief, anticipatory pauses. The Cjt, first established as a kind of anticipation in 8, provides referential stability for its line. For the overall passage, C# and B are referential, providing a contextual means of clarify ing departures and arrivals, segmentation, and stability through pitch. The use of pitch sharpens the profile of the particularity, distinguishing it further from neighboring events (see Example 2). Though particular and discrete, events also exhibit relatedness. There is, for instance, a ubiquitous tendency of certain melodic lines to change direction from note to note in a roughly even but somehow off-kilter rhythm (a "zigzag" contour), followed by a leap downward (the opening motto being the prime example). The downward leap becomes a kind of archetypal gesture of release, signifying the end of a gesture. This ten dency is apparent in the viola "intrusions" and is augmented in the shape of the bass-clarinet phrase. It is a quality that permeates the work in innu merable variations with varying degrees of clarity (see Example 3).</page><page sequence="5">176 Perspectives of New Music (a) (b) (c) EXAMPLE 3: (A) DELTA OPENING, (B) THE VIOLA "INTRUSIONS," (C) THE BASS CLARINET PHRASE By introducing tendencies of continuity and coherence I am focusing on that element of totality diametrically opposed to contingent particu larity and yet which is intimately bound to it. The effective particularity of events is recognizable to the extent some stability or point of reference is established to define it. Rosenzweig's means of balancing momentary particularity, to the extent he reaches beyond the limited norms of "uptown" modernism, are effective and quite original. They are artistic constructions in their own right meant to supersede, control, and yet ultimately empower the particularity of the moment.</page><page sequence="6">The Music of Morris Rosenzweig 177 IL "Structural Notes" Rosenzweig conceives of events as being in opposition to an over-arching force governing, directing, and reining them in, analogous in some respects to the normative function of tonality. In the liner notes to Another Order of Cat (1984) for Pierrot ensemble, Rosenzweig writes of his music "gravitating" towards "structurally important notes."4 In con ventional notions of "atonal" music, the conceptual prioritization of spe cific pitches is provocative. So much of what is normative in the music of Webern, Babbitt, etc., can be described in terms directly antithetical to the norms of tonality. Pulse is avoided; tonal center is negated by chro matic saturation (and so forth). Because Rosenzweig's music shares a similar sound world with that of those composers, his characterization merits special inspection. My conclusion: Rosenzweig's structural notes and gravity represents a significant shift in conception from the tradi tional polarity of tonal and atonal music. His development of overarch ing, pitch-specific techniques supplements (and significantly transforms) the aesthetics of modernism inherited from his teachers. These technical innovations amount to a particularity of another order: the particularity embodied in Rosenzweig's work as a whole. EXAMPLE 4: THE BEGINNING OF ANOTHER ORDER OF CAT A most rudimentary organization of sounds, the A\&gt; repetitions in Example 4 evoke more the mechanical rapping of a small hammer than the beginning of a piece of music. By about the third or fourth sound the listener has no way of predicting how many of these articulations will occur. Though the gesture is subsumed by the entrance of the other instruments, it emerges here and there during the course of the move ment. A minute into the composition the idea is adorned with new pitches and rhythms. The violin offbeat triplets and the cello arpeggiation in sixteenth notes add texture. If the opening gesture was a hammer, this is a simple machine (Example 5).</page><page sequence="7">178 Perspectives of New Music EXAMPLE 5: another order of cat, measures 27-30 In the context of the 'uptown' aesthetic in which Ch?came into being, its beginning certainly violates the normative syntax of what would be expected in that context. Despite the disturbing lack of syntactical infor mation in the opening bars, the piece as a whole embraces the normative qualities of his teachers and peers. Still, the gesture of emphatic repetition remains curious. I see in it the beginnings of a technical experiment which will prove to be an essential feature of Rosenzweig's music. It marks a fundamental shift towards a harmonic condition that Rosenzweig hears and feels as potential and artistically necessary, but which will require years to fully realize. As the piece progresses, the cello is heard playing an aggressive, re articulated pedal on Al? from time to time. Its occurrence is ever more frequent, and its duration ever more expanded. Finally, at the climax of the movement (Example 6), four of the instru ments spin out a quirky tune in unison. Meanwhile, the cello doggedly articulates an At pedal. As the unison reaches its zenith, the cello breaks out of the Al?, bringing the passage to a close in measure 270, with the A\&gt; returning. The cello pedal shares a common heritage with the machine music of 27, embodied in the opening gesture of Cat: the per sistent articulation of a pitch. This basic device forms the technical basis of Rosenzweig's structural notes and gravity. The drive to create a global control of pitch is a natural extension of Rosenzweig's musical disposition, which demonstrates a special feeling for pitch differentiation on the most immediate level. The pervasive ten dency for melodic lines to turn back to a just heard note (as observed, for instance, in Delta), sometimes several times, yields a continuous differen tiation of pitch, a palpable narrative of shifting emphases directly contrib uting to the particularity of events. The tendency to differentiate between the pitches themselves, over and above intervallic patterning, is essential to Rosenzweig's formal conception. The very use of pitch emphasis which particularizes momentary events is also a technical</page><page sequence="8">The Music of Morris Rosenzweig 179 EXAMPLE 6: ANOTHER ORDER OF CAT, MEASURES 259-70 resource for continuity As I argued before, continuity and particularity are the "yin and yang" of totality in this music. III. Harmonic Perspecuity The illustration in Example 7 depicts pitches arranged by what I would term "harmonic perspecuity." The nearer a pitch is to the front of the field the greater its accumulated impression or emphasis over time. To the extent the frontward pitch might be regarded as a "structural note," it is structural on the basis of articulated differentiation of the entire chromatic field. The notion of a differentiated chromatic field is nascent in Wolpe's lec ture "Thinking Twice."5 As antidote to the "stagnant" "hypertrophie abundance" of the "all-chromatic circuit," Wolpe suggests: One may decide to give a certain number of tones a greater prepon derance in time, to enhance acutely the plasticity of their pitch</page><page sequence="9">180 Perspectives of New Music EXAMPLE 7 (IMAGE COURTESY OF JON WILD) arrangements. This requires revising one's attitude towards the mul tiplication of tones on different registers (levels). ... A given tone may appear with different frequencies at different levels. It isn't entirely clear whether Wolpe means 'levels' in the sense of dif ferentiation of presence of a pitch from register to register or in the sense of a leveling or gradation of overall pitch emphasis (or both). Either interpretation is suggestive. "Autonomous fragment(s)," which are "pitch constellation(s) smaller than the all-chromatic circuit" become "unhinged as part of the circuit," a process Wolpe calls "modulatory cir culation." Fragments resting "within the total chromatic orbit" also "dis pense" with the orbit provided: "a pitch-field ... is set up containing the necessary fixed pitches, which then maintain the equilibrium with their inner-rotating moves." (italics mine) Wolpe asserts that the fixed pitches "decentralize" the all chromatic set, "interfering" with its continuum. In so doing, the "hypertrophie abundance" of the chromatic is transformed in a "spectralization of pitches." Two dimensions explode into three. The state of balance of the chromatic becomes decentralized, or thrown into relief. In the next few sections I offer a few typical examples of the technical means Rosenzweig employs to achieve a 'decentralized' or differentiated chromatic field sim ilar to Wolpe's concept in certain of his works.</page><page sequence="10">The Music of Morris Rosenzweig 181 IV. Hammers and Machines The technique of emphatic re-articulation of pitch observed in Cat appears in various guises in many subsequent works. In no work is this basic device more elaborately developed than in trace (1998), for two pianos and two percussionists. This extended and extremely difficult work proceeds like an extravagant minimalist work "cracked open," to borrow from Martin Brody.6 Textures are constructed from cross purposed rhythmic cycles which enunciate a dynamic movement of chro matic color against a rigid harmonic pole (see Example 8). example 8: trace, measures 161-6 This bit comes from a section marked "ostinato," which features an ascending line in half and whole steps through two chromatic tetra chords: B-G-C|~D and Ff-G-Gft-A. The piano 1 and marimba, though out of sync with each other, emphasize the remaining chromatic pitches (E1&gt;-E-F-BI?) as a kind of "axis" nested within a shifting cluster. B!?</page><page sequence="11">182 Perspectives of New Music predominates. A "clanking" texture trends gradually upward with accel erating density. The axis becomes increasingly obscured by the general clamor, until at the very end of the passage it is lost altogether. The per sistence of axis pitches against a steady, machine-like textural transforma tion is a continuing story throughout the work, providing an energetic, proliferating counterpoint. As one texture-axis unfolds, another appears. The cresting of one is the cover for another's emergence.

Sustained Pedal-Point In this remarkable passage from Delta (Example 9), the horn drones in alternating D-E (one in its lovely tenor range, the other a deep growl) throughout the coming-and-going of ephemeral, fragmentary gestures. Rosenzweig describes the horn music here as representing Delta's breathing while asleep.7 The intermittent bits effectively depict a series of fleeting dreamscapes. The astonishing duration of the mantra-like, two note horn song takes on a particularity of its own. It is strikingly incon gruous against the more active events in its simplicity and duration. The pedal line initiated by the horn continues by the ensemble well past what is shown here, eventually passing on to F and ultimately back to D. This acute stratification of gesture is maintained uninterrupted for several minutes, traversing drifting events, phrases, and sections. Through the simplest of means, Rosenzweig asserts a dialectic of levels. Pitch and rhythm coordinate consistently on two planes. The listener is forced to regard the D-E pedal as fundamentally separate from the contrasting ephemeral material. In the absence of a tonal frame, it becomes the har monic and rhythmic point of reference, coloring and transforming the concomitant material. VI. Permeation In Example 10a, from trace, a fine needlepoint of sixteenth notes pro duces a statistical impression of a differentiated chromatic field. Pitches are not sustained or repeated for more than a fraction of a second, yet memory retains differentiation. Breaking down measures 43-53 into three rhythmic streams (sextuplets, quintuplets, and sixteenths), a rough pitch count yields distinct (but not neatly partitioned) pitch hierarchies (Example 10b). The graphs control for number of articulations. There are some longer notes (especially AI?, Et, and Dt) that if accounted for would further dif ferentiate the ends of the continuum. At bar 54, the sudden pianissimo G(+) quintuplets temporarily upend the pitch hierarchy. And yet, at 56, the At and Et are revived for the next section. The permeation of pitches in a clear hierarchy allows Rosenzweig to control a harmonic field for sus tained periods. The consistent, controlled definition of the pitch field produces a structural-harmonic rhythm. Bar 54's departure from the field, as harmonic upbeat, sets off the beginning-ness of the next section as well as a sense of return (acquiescence) to the preceding harmonic field. The manner of articulating the field shifts decidedly. The prominent</page><page sequence="13">184 Perspectives of New Music EXAMPLE 10A: TRACE, MEASURES 43-56 pitch field is perpetuated while the texture indicates a new rhythmic sec tion set off by the sure harmonic upbeat felt in bar 54.</page><page sequence="14">The Music of Morris Rosenzweig 185 Pitch Sixteenths Quintuplets Sextuplets Total TT 1 10 29 35 26 29 13 14 27 54 10 21 10 16 16 22 32 17 14 15 19 27 EXAMPLE IOB: PITCH COUNT AND PITCH HIERARCHIES (TABLE); THE OVERALL PITCH FIELD IN RECEDING PERSPICUITY (GRAPH) VII. Modular Units8 Roman Passacaglias (1991) for piano trio is constructed from five non transposing "passacaglias." Each instrument features a passacaglia of its own. Well into the piece, they join together (Example 11). It is a pleasing phrase. The violin busies itself with a tenacious rising figure, the cello languidly provides a pulse-arpeggiation, and the piano is in the background with wisps of an almost tango-like music. All three of these musics appear before this passage, several times. Each is developed with its own accompanying figures, which in turn are derived in one way or another from the other passacaglias. The passacaglias, in a sense, pur sue their own destinies. Variety and energy come from exploring the change possible in a musical object, not from its own alteration, but</page><page sequence="15">186 Perspectives of New Music EXAMPLE 11: ROMAN PASSACAGLIAS, MEASURES 13 5-40 through shifting contexts (mise-en-scene). The formal idea places its bets on the dynamic potentialities of the passacaglias, taking advantage of opportunities of pitch association. Perhaps most tellingly, the similarity of ending pitches in the cello and piano passacaglias produce cadential simi larities throughout the piece. The C/A to E1?/A|? of the piano corre sponds to the C-A-C-A~e1&gt; of the cello. Both passacaglias use C/A as a penultimate pitch area and El? (and At in piano) as a kind of cadential sonority. To the extent this pitch association suggests a feeling of closure, rhythmic and other elements are able to act against that feeling, strength ening the larger continuity without disrupting the local rhythmic event. VIII. Presence, Absence, and Prolongation At the 2004 Wellesley Composers Conference, Rosenzweig, who was the featured composer, presented and discussed his piece Melpomene (2000) to the composition fellows. Melpomene is a meditative, dreamy work befit ting its 'soft' instrumentation: cello against a backdrop of flute, mallet per cussion, and harp. To demonstrate his compositional process, Rosenzweig focused his remarks on the opening measures (see Example 12). In his presentation, Rosenzweig distributed graphs to illustrate his compositional process in the piece. Example 13 reproduces his sketch of the opening eight bars.</page><page sequence="16">The Music of Morris Rosenzweig 187 for John Eckstein Morris Rosenzweig EXAMPLE 12: MELPOMENE, OPENING MEASURES The reader will surely recognize the resemblance to Schenkerian sym bology. Indeed, Rosenzweig writes "Prolongation Sketch" at the top of the page. Below the staff, vertical sonorities are described as ordered PC intervals above the bass. Despite the overt adaptation of the graphic scheme, the meaning of symbols is, strictly speaking, quite different from that of Schenker. The gradation of note values (beamed half, quarter, eighth, un-stemmed, etc.) is intended to give a visual impression of the relative importance of pitches as Rosenzweig conceives of them. As pure analysis, the sketch would be considered problematic. But, of course, this</page><page sequence="17">188 Perspectives of New Music example 13 is a compositional sketch. Its unabashed adaptation of quasi-Schenker symbology is tantalizing in the sense that it apparently provides Rosenzweig a useful tool for conceptualizing his harmonic/contrapuntal discourse. Ironically, as a theoretical scheme, arriving at a similar graphic analysis would be almost unthinkable. Whether this gap represents a defi ciency on the part of modern theory or simply a libertine indifference to established theoretical norms (or both) is certainly a valid question. Whatever the case, the use of such symbology for ends so radically differ ent than those for which it was conceived is an interesting point in itself. It offers a challenge: can an analysis follow?9 123 456 7 8 9 10 y l&gt;o l?o ?].e.

It corresponds for the most part with Rosenzweig's "Prolonga tional Sketch," It is clear that the pitches Rosenzweig emphasizes in his</page><page sequence="18">The Music of Morris Rosenzweig 189 EXAMPLE 15 graph, especially the D, are, in fact, more prominent than others. A simple note-count shows a range of emphasis, from 6 (C) to 5 (D and F|) to 4 (E and G) and so forth down to 0 (F). Looking closer at the more prominent pitches, D and F| always appear together (chords 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10). These chords seem to have quite a different composition of notes than the other five (although the C inhabits both worlds; a com mon tone, perhaps?). On this basis I will classify the two harmonic types as x (D and F| absent) and y (D and F| present). The distinction is con firmed aurally: in its consistency and relative prevalence, y predominates. x chords, especially those of 8 and 9, are not heard so much as returning to a harmonic region, but as departing from y. Thus, x could be described as not y (see Example 15). EXAMPLE 16 A linear, motivic element reinforces the effect of this progression. The top line of chords 1-3, Dl&gt; to C, passes to the D in register. This line is emphasized by the instrumentation: the flute's poignant falling half-step</page><page sequence="19">190 Perspectives of New Music is answered by the pronounced D between harp and cello. This same line is echoed in the movement from the second set of x chords to y. The motive (represented in Example 16 as a) is pitch-specific and exceedingly concise/memorable in its interval content. It also carries rhythmic infor mation (albeit slow and ephemeral): short-short-long. Qualitatively, the motive suggests antecedent-consequence progression. The D contradicts the sliding passive movement of the half-step in direction and pitch. The weak-strong quality of the motive reinforces the harmonic interpretation of x (not y) to y. Transpositions of a are hearable, including what I've called a'below (notable especially because it repeats). Stephen Jay Gould famously pointed out that there is no such thing as "the chimpanzee," there are only chimpanzees. The perception of a phylo genetic relatedness encompassing all the variants of a species seems a fit ting analogy to characterize this technique of harmonic control developed in Rosenzweig's more recent music. The sensation of harmonic "pull" or tension oddly similar to that of tonality is a product largely of the percep tion of like and un-like harmonies. It may not be quite accurate to speak of a tonic harmony in the tonal sense, and certainly there is no linear scale other than the chromatic itself. The key to this tonal-like gravitation is not a consistency of internal contents (these notes and these intervals), nor to a stabilized, consistent set of relations. The D and F#, as hierarchically prominent pitches, condition the quality of the other notes. Nothing is heard as purely itself. The D and F| remain veiled, continuously reinter preted through a prism shifting colors. And precisely when there is no D or F | present, their influence on the sounding harmony, slanting or tint ing it, continues. There is a clear subordination of the x chords to y, and within y a hierarchy of principal and more secondary notes is continually recast within a shifting chromatic universe. The particular harmonic quali ties of Melpomene are aurally robust; yet they cannot be definitively reduced to a single, immutable hierarchy. As Melpomene unfolds, I am reminded of Joseph Campbell's "Masks of God." Each harmony is a dif ferent mask, particular and yet embodying some new aspect of a transcen dent whole which cannot be directly known. IX. Formal Concerns Consistent differentiation of the chromatic field is progressively more sophisticated and integral to the overall form of Rosenzweig's music. The examples in the preceding sections, though only excerpts, are by no means isolated cases. And, indeed, the specific pitches involved are not momentarily favored, but play into an overall concept, contextually</page><page sequence="20">The Music of Morris Rosenzweig 191 defined. Though an exhaustive analysis of any single work would exceed the scope of this paper, Rosenzweig's structural conception is manifestly operative end-to-end in many of his compositions. A movement from his Quartet for strings (1997) will serve to illustrate this, though, again, its complete analysis would not be appropriate here (see Example 17). EXAMPLE 17: THE OPENING OF THE THIRD MOVEMENT ("RONDO") After a deceptively genteel opening, a series of angular gestures lay out the principal material. The gestures are treated as non-transposing, detachable units, similar to the modular units in Passacaglias. Their order and frequency are manipulated at each statement. Pitches are fixed, but textures are fair game. At each appearance the notes Cjt and G are brought out as central to some internal argument, which is increasingly clear as the movement progresses. A lickety-split unison tune between the violins and viola over a cello pedal offers a counter idea. It also does not transpose (Example 18).</page><page sequence="21">192 Perspectives of New Music J.=80 a vin i-?, via ^^^EESSa * &lt;&gt; jp marcato sempre ro/i&gt; EXAMPLE 18: QUARTET, III, MEASURES 10-2 Because both groups maintain their own internal pitch-specific dialec tics, the contrast between the two groups is also of pitch areas.

Both proceed through the dynamic enactment of a conflict between two pitch areas.10 Rosenzweig's harmonic contrariety seeks not to mimic that of tonal practice so much as to assert a comparable form-generating har</page><page sequence="22">The Music of Morris Rosenzweig 193 vc 2 2 2 ' --2- 'm(P marcato sempre EXAMPLE 19 (CONT.) EXAMPLE 20: QUARTET, III, MEASURES 121-END monk premise. As Rosenzweig's techniques become progressively more secure, his shift in emphasis towards a pitch-specific, yet chromatic, har monic world is increasingly convincing. The end of the Quartet is an excellent moment for the listener to reflect on how these techniques have affected the experience. As the octave G dies away, its dynamic presence may still be felt. This was no mere sound, no incidental gesture, but a perilously stabilized contradiction, pregnant with vivid, active qualities. In short, it is a gesture that contains also the stored up energy and simul taneous release of the form. X. Epilogue Adorno describes form as "a force field organized around a problem."11 To the extent the development of a comprehensive, normative alternative to the "objective artifice" of tonality is a defining issue in Rosenzweig's work, a "force field" of sorts may be observed in the style and technique of his oeuvre. "Form" in this sense is not of a single composition but of a body of work. The purpose of this paper has essentially been to consider the particular form of Rosenzweig's artistic production as a whole. The</page><page sequence="23">194 Perspectives of New Music force field of this problem is detected in its varied manifestations from work to work. But of course, its particular manifestation also (and princi pally) functions for the formal-artistic ends of the work at hand. In the individual work, tendencies taking on the immediate role of normative artifice become the basis for the force field of that work. The quote by Hannah Arendt at the opening of this paper is an appropriate point of departure, not only as a description of the subjective artist defining him self against man-made artifice, but of the dialectic between the contin gent particularities of a work and a (potentially) novel, contextually defined normative artifice. Along with certain stylistic traits of modern ism which remain in force in this music, Rosenzweig's structural notes and gravity complement the particularity of events, imparting coherence and providing a basis through which their unique qualities can be per ceived. Phenomenologically, the artifice of tonality and Rosenzweig's tonal-like concept may not be as different that they are in theory. In a functional sense, they both fulfill the primary role of defining normative pitch action so crucial to the dialectical generation of form, the sensation of which is a force-field, the palpable process of a musical totality.</page><page sequence="24">The Music of Morris Rosenzweig 195 Notes Special thanks to Martin Brody for his expert and patient advice, and to Morris Rosenzweig, whose remarkable music inspired this paper.

I am attempting to balance the admonitions of Straus and others against the haphazard use of Schenkerian notions with a respect for the composer's intentions and the desire to consider the music from a</page><page sequence="25">196 Perspectives of New Music more phenomenological perspective. This, I believe, is closer to both the composer's intent as well as to the artistic aspects of his work and is therefore more appropriate to a critical essay. As an alternate to the strictly functional definitions of tonal theory, 'gravity' could be a met aphor for the sensation of movement permeating an event which hasn't yet moved, reminiscent of Gurney: "There is perpetually involved something more even than a suggestion of movement, namely, a direct impulse to move; which is not only felt but con stantly yielded to in various degrees" (Edmund Gurney, The Power of Sound (London: Smith, Elder, &amp; Co., 1880), p. 103). Even in tonal music, totality results from a convergence of many properties over and above raw tonal functions. In essence, gravity is a highly particu lar phenomenon conditioned by a given context. 10. Scott Burnham writes "The nature of sonata form may be broader than this exclusive renewal of a central tonic, broader than that fraught journey home: the nature of sonata form may teach us that renewal is a basic rhythm of life" ("The Second Nature of Sonata Form," in Music Theory and Natural Order from the Renaissance to the Early Twentieth Century, ed. Suzannah Clark and Alexander Rehding (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001)). 11. Theodor W. Adorno, "On the Problem of Musical Analysis," in Essays on Music, ed.
