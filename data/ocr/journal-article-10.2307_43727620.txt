This is a very fine study with a deceptively simple title. Voorwinde's analysis offers a rich and new perspective on Johannine theology, christology, and soteriology. It is a revision of a doctoral thesis for the Australian College of Theology, under the supervision of Rikki Watts and Mark Harding. V. situates his approach within the debate between Rudolph Bultmann and Ernst Käsemann regarding the Johannine portrayal of Jesus in terms of the humanity and/or divinity of Jesus. The question he asks is: Do the emotions of Jesus emerge from his humanity or do they reflect divine pathos? In the introductory chapter, V. reviews the Bultmann/Käsemann debate and intro- duces the soteriological perspective proposed by Rudolf Schnackenburg that requires a both/and rather than the either/or approach of Bultmann and Käsemann with respect to Jesus' divinity and humanity. This theological framework moves V.'s analysis away from concerns regarding the "historical Jesus" and any attempt to offer a psychological interpre- tation of the Gospel. V. employs a narrative-critical methodology, regarding the Gospel as</page><page sequence="2">558 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 68,2006 a literary unit and the portrait of Jesus as a Johannine characterization. In this first chapter, he clarifies his use of the term "emotion" to refer to both feelings and attitudes. In the second chapter, V. establishes the religious background for the Gospel with a review of the emotions attributed to God in the Hebrew OT and compares this with the LXX. His findings show that the anthropomorphic and anthropopathic descriptions of God in the MT have mainly been preserved in the LXX, with some exceptions. In this section, he introduces a framework for describing divine emotions in terms of the covenant and argues that God's emotions, as depicted in the OT, are "set within a covenant framework. God feels most strongly about those with whom he has entered into a covenant relation- ship" (p. 41). The trend found in the OT continues in the Dead Sea Scrolls and Apocrypha. This chapter briefly examines the Synoptic Gospels and concludes that the covenant pro- vides a useful framework for considering Jesus' emotions in the Synoptics, and that there was a strong correlation between the emotions of Jesus and his miracles/passion. In chap. 3, V. begins the detailed examination of John's Gospel. This chapter in par- ticular offers a number of new insights into the Gospel and establishes the parameters for the later exegetical studies of particular pericopae. V. argues that the Pentateuch offers an important framework for understanding the Johannine Jesus. Jesus, as the Word, fulfills the role of the divine creator at the beginning of the Pentateuch, and the Mosaic prophet at the end (p. 7 1 ). Much of the imagery of the Pentateuch is applied to Jesus, for example, the brazen serpent, the manna, the true water-giving rock, and true paschal sacrifice. The typology of the Gospel is restricted to animals and objects and is never used of human characters. V. argues that the restriction of the typology is due to the Johannine presenta- tion of Jesus as the covenanting Lord rather than as a covenant partner, or covenant media- tor. In the passion, through his death as the sacrificial lamb, the Lord of the covenant becomes the covenant sacrifice. This idea is carried by the imagery of the paschal lamb. V. concludes the chapter by describing two axes for examining the emotions of Jesus: ( 1 ) Jesus assumes the roles of the creator of Genesis, the redeemer of Exodus, and the Lord who renews the covenant in Deuteronomy; (2) in becoming flesh, he fulfills the role of the sacrificial lamb of God. In the following chapters, V. examines particular pericopae, "Zeal for the Temple" (chap. 4), "Lazarus" (chap. 5), and the final discourse (chaps. 6 and 7). These exegetical analyses will be useful resources for scholars who need detailed background of particular emotions such as those found in John 1 1 and 12. Voorwinde concludes from this analysis that the emotions of the Johannine Jesus have both human and divine dimensions, and all are linked to the passion, having therefore a soteriological context. Ten appendixes provide helpful summarizing charts of the emotions of God in the OT, emotions of Jesus in the NT, and emotions in the Gospel of John. Indexes of authors and references are provided. Although I do not agree with all aspects of V.'s interpretation of specific texts, I find the perspective he takes, particularly in his third chapter, most convincing. His comparison with the Pentateuch and the presentation of Jesus in a covenantal framework is very insightful.
