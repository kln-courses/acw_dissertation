<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS "hosanna" is not found in all four gospels - it is not in Luke (p. 24; the preceding paragraph has it correctly); it is not said in Jonah 4 8 that Jonah was "sorrowful even unto death" (p. 56); Judea fell under procurators in A.D. 6, not B.C. (p. 76); Acts 6 13 f. does not agree with the fourth gospel that Jesus said he would destroy the temple, etc., but agrees with Matthew and Mark that false witnesses said Jesus said this (p. 84). And on p. 93, did the author really mean to quote Vaticanus at John 19 5: "Here is a man"? BURTON H. THROCKMORTON, JR. BANGOR THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY The Philistines and Their Material Culture (Hebr.), by Trude Dothan. Jerusalem: Bialik Institute and Israel Exploration Society, 1967. Pp. 250 (incl. 2 maps, 80 photographs, 132 drawings)+bibliog. + English summary. The Aegean affinities of Philistine pottery were recognized many years ago, but until now the various details, which pointed to these affinities and to the rela- tionships of Philistine wares with other pottery of the East Mediterranean world, had not been fully examined. Mrs. Do- than's volume fills this gap in Philistine research. The first chapter, introductory in nature, presents, in brief, information about the Philistines gleaned from both Egyptian and biblical sources. It con- tains a resume of each of the Philistines' major cities, their civil and military or- ganization, their religion, and the various speculations concerning the Philistines' place of origin. in UNIVERSITY of PENNSYLVANIA PRESS Just Published ORIENTAL AND BIBLICAL STUDIES - Collected Writings of E. A. Speiser Edited by J. J. Finkelstein and Moshe Greenberg Collected in this volume are thirty-six essays by the late E. A. Speiser, the re- nowned author of the Anchor Bible Genesis and a leading American orien- talist. Written with style and wit, they deal not only with biblical studies and linguistics but also with the civiliza- tions of Mesopotamia, Syria, and Pales- tine; with law and political science; and with intellectual and social prog- ress in the Ancient Near East. Rarely has mastery of a field been com- bined with such style and lucidity as in the writings of E. A. Speiser. These essays, selected and arranged to cap- ture the underlying unity that informed all of his work, will bring to the non- specialist a rich awareness of the broad scope of oriental scholarship. 616 pp. $10.00 GEORGE JOYE, 1495-1553: A Chapter in the History of the English Bible and the English Reformation By Charles C. Butterworth and Allan G. Chester "George Joye, a complex and interesting Protestant divine, is emerging now as a far more important man in the English Reformation. This book does much to demonstrate his importance with regard to the work of Biblical translation."- Seminary Journal 293 pp. $6.00 UNIVERSITY of PENNSYLVANIA PRESS Philadelphia 473 I</page><page sequence="2">474 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Mrs. Dothan's major concern is the Philistines' material culture, and in the second chapter she discusses, site by site, the Philistine pottery found in Palestine, moving from south to north, and giving careful attention to the attendant stratigraphical and chronological problems. Grave finds and poorly stratified sherds are fitted into the chronology on the basis of typological comparisons. The result of Mrs. Dothan's stratigraphical and chronological examination is the division of Philistine pottery into three periods, A, B, and C, A being the earliest. Chapter 3 is the heart of the book. In it, Mrs. Dothan has classified the pottery into seventeen types and analyzed each type in terms of its shape and decoration. Using the finds of this analysis, and drawing on the repertory of Aegean pottery and the repertory of imported and local Palestinian wares, she tries to identify the archtypes from which each Philistine type derives. The types are presented in groups according to their probable source of derivation: Mycenean, Cypriote, Egyptian, and Palestinian. In addition to the seventeen pottery types, Mrs. Dothan also discusses pottery forms of cultic significance and their derivation. Mrs. Dothan postulates that the traits of Philistine pottery derived from these four sources were picked up during the Philistines' wanderings to the Holy Land and after their settlement there. Cypriote traits do not appear until the Philistines have been in Palestine for a time, during Period B. This raises a chronological problem which Mrs. Dothan does not discuss. One would expect these traits to appear earlier if they are a true reflection of the route taken by the Philistines. Whether the similarities between Period A ware and Late Mycenean pottery are only the result of traits picked up during wandering or whether they are also the result of the two groups' having a similar culture to begin with might also have been discussed, especially in view of the similarities between the cult objects. Although the decorative motifs of the Philistine wares are discussed in conjunction with the pottery types on which they appear, they are also presented separately, along- side the Mycenean motifs with which they compare most closely. The fourth chapter deals with the well-known anthropomorphic ceramic graves which have often been attributed to the Philistines. Mrs. Dothan sees in them and their associated finds the amalgam of an Egyptian burial custom and Aegean and Palestinian influences. Whether or not one accepts Mrs. Dothan's postulates does not affect the usefulness of her volume. The large number of Philistine finds which she has gathered in one place will greatly facilitate further study. The drawings are abundant and clear, and the photographs are good, including several previously unpublished sherds. The book is a welcome addition to the repertoire of archeological studies. ANNE G.
