<plain_text><page sequence="1">PETRARCH AND THE STORY OF THE CHOICE OF HERCULES By Theodor E. Mommsen n his book Hercules am Scheidewege, Erwin Panofsky has shown how the ancient tale of the choice of Hercules became during the Renaissance a favourite theme of humanist writers and playwrights, and of artists, especially in Italy and Germany.' The great popularity of the theme in antiquity as well as in the Renaissance and afterwards is striking in contrast to its complete absence from the work of mediaeval writers and artists. According to Panofsky, "the topic was revived in literature only around the year 14oo," making its first appearance in Coluccio Salutati's treatise De laboribus Herculis.2 Panofsky supported this point by remarking that "neither do Petrarch and Boccaccio mention the decision of Hercules nor do the mediaeval mythographers, Berchorius, Villena and the Livre du fort Hercules."3 This statement requires a modification as far as Petrarch is concerned, for he actually did know the story. Petrarch, to be sure,'does not mention the choice of Hercules where one would expect to find it, in the "Life of Hercules," which formed a part of the first version of his biographical collection De viris illustribus and which was probably written in the year 1337 or shortly afterwards.4 It is true that he never finished that biography, but if he had intended to tell of the decision made by the young Hercules, he would have done so at the beginning. The name of Hercules appears a number of times in Petrarch's Rerum Memorandarum Libri,6 and in his correspondence,6 but always without any reference to the choice. However, in his De vita solitaria, which he began in 1346, Petrarch referred in two different places (1, 4, 2; 2, 9, 4) very explicitly to the choice of Hercules. Before starting the discussion of these passages it is necessary to ask why the ancient tale was so completely neglected throughout the Middle Ages. At first this phenomenon seems rather strange, because mediaeval scholars certainly must have come upon the story in Cicero's De officiis (I, 32, 118; 3, 5, 25), and, one might think, must have found its moral lesson highly 1 E.

Actually, however, as Panofsky proved very convincingly, the story implied a moral conception which from the Christian point of view was much too pagan and secular and therefore had to be passed over in silence.1 In the first place, the two ways of life were represented in the tale by the personifications of what was considered praiseworthy and bad (virtus and voluptas) in a strictly earthly sense and not at all in accordance with the Christian interpretation of the eternal meaning of good and evil. And secondly, no Christian was given the right, which in the story was claimed for Hercules, to make an entirely free and wholly individual choice concerning the basic direction of his life; it was granted only to Christ that "he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good" (Isaiah'vii. 15)- Panofsky discussed this tacit rejection of the tale of the choice of Hercules in connexion with his observation that throughout the Middle Ages artists created many pictorial and sculptural images of the various virtutes and vitia, either in whole cycles or individually, but no representations of virtus or vitium in general.2 The ancients had held, of course, the concept of a supreme Virtue, the dea virtus, which could be depicted in an anthropomorphic figure, but such deification of virtus was not acceptable to any Christian theologian. Thus it was denounced in the most explicit terms by St. Augustine who wrote in The City of God: "(The pagans) made also virtus a goddess; if she really were a goddess, she would indeed have to be preferred to many others; but since actually she is not a goddess but a gift of God, she is to be obtained by Him by whom alone she can be given."3 The virtus Dei as the power of God in the fullest sense was personified by Christ alone, as St. Paul taught.4 It was therefore in complete accordance with the Christian refutation of the pagan concept of the dea virtus, Panofsky said, that "mediaeval thinking could no longer seek for the supreme Virtue in the anthropomorphic but only in the metaphysical sphere."5 On the other hand, since the individual virtutes were to be achieved by man in this world, they could be represented by earthly personifications, such as the life-like figures of women.6 The Augustinian distinction between the supranatural character of the supreme virtus Dei on one side, and the variety of the cardinal, theological and other virtutes entering into the realm of human life on the other side, apparently dominated artistic tradition to the very end of the Middle Ages. Whosoever wanted to deviate from that tradition and create an image of the supreme Virtue could do so only in full awareness of the novelty of his attempt. This becomes evident to the reader of the remarks which the Tuscan writer and designer Francesco da Barberino (1264-I348) made in the Latin 1 Panofsky, op. cit., p. 156. 2Panofsky, op. cit., p. 151 f. 3 De civitate Dei, ed.

MOMMSEN commentaries to his work Documenti d'Amore (published in 1314).1 In con- nexion with his discussion of "the three kinds of virtus (i.e., naturalis, spiritualis, and animalis)," Francesco da Barberino said that he intended "to represent the virtus moralis in genere." As he knew, "some people declared that although it is possible to represent in images the virtutes in specie, it is impossible to depict the virtus in genere." But in spite of those objections Francesco decided "to proceed ad istam generalitatem figurandam," and actually drew a sketch of the virtus in genere or virtus generalis. He did so "not without some great hesita- tion," as he admitted himself, because he was conscious of "the novelty of the image" to be introduced by him.a Francesco da Barberino's allegorical image of the virtus generalis remained, it seems, unique of its kind for a long while, and the artists of the Trecento and Quattrocento continued to depict, in accordance with the mediaeval tradition, merely the "special" virtues and vices.3 It was only a century and a half after the composition of the Documenti d'Amore that another Italian, Antonio Averlino, who chose to call himself Filarete, "the friend of Virtue," attempted again to design an allegorical image of the supreme virth, as dis- tinguished from the allegories representing the "special" virtues. In his Trattato d'Architettura, which was written between the years 1460 and 1464,' Filarete described an imaginary "House of Virtue and Vice" to be erected 1 The work was edited by F. Egidi, 4 vols., Rome, I905-27; as to the date of its composi- tion, see ibid., IV, pp. xxxii-xLI; on Fran- cesco da Barberino's life and works, compare Egidi's article in Enciclopedia Italiana, VI, 1930, p. 14I (with bibliography). I owe the reference to the subsequently discussed passage in the Documenti d'Amore to Professor Panofsky who discovered it only after he had published his Hercules am Scheidewege. 2Ed. Egidi, op. cit., I, 66: "Sed primo quidem nobis videndum est et sciendum, quod tres species sunt virtutis: naturalis, spiritualis et animalis. Forma tamen virtutis, quam representare intendo, est moralis in genere, ut ad omnem se moralem hoc genus extendat, et ita idem dico de vitiis, que con- sistunt in omnia. Nec obmicto, quamvis aliqui dixerint, quod licet possibile sit representare in figuris virtutes in specie, tamen in genere figurare virtutem impossibile videbatur, quin ad istam generalitatem figurandam procedam non in contentum illorum sed ad quandam qualem novitatis effigiem inducendam in amoris honorem servorumque suorum gau- dium aliquale. Et quia facto rei cuilibet fundamento, ut dicitur supra circa principium prohemii ibi ubi de amoris forma tractatur [see op. cit., I, 8 f.], igitur reservatis rationibus formarum et locorum hic designatorum infra loco suo antequam ad aliorum expositionem divertatur, et reservato etiam ipsius moralis virtutis tractatu similiter loco suo hic figuras ipsius generalis virtutis et vitiorum, secundum quod capere potuit mei modicitas intellectus, non sine quadam magna dubitatione repre- sento." With the remark: "Vide illas: hic sunt," Francesco refers to a sketch on the same page which shows the virtus in genere being attacked by ten figures which represent the vices, under the heading: "hec sunt opposita"; see ibid., I, 66, Egidi's drawing of Francesco's sketch; a photographic reproduc- tion of the original sketch (from Cod. Barber. 4076, f. 6v) was published by Egidi in his earlier article "Le miniature dei codici barberiniani dei Documenti d'Amore," L'Arte, V, Igo2, p. 89.

In this connexion he declared that he tried to find out 'through reading and through inquiry whether virt&amp; and vitio had ever been represented in such a way that either one of them could be perceived in a single figure." But, he said, "I have not found as yet that they were represented in one figure," whereas there existed, of course, many representa- tions of the four cardinal and the three theological virtues or of the seven principal vices.' According to Filarete, the only personifications of virti and vitio were to be found in the story of the choice of Hercules, as told by Xenophon." Since Filarete considered these latter allegories "unsatisfactory," he decided to use his own mind and imagination and proceeded "to represent virtis and vitio, each alone and by itself in one figure."8 These remarks indicate that in the second part of the fifteenth century the conception of an allegorical representation of virtus generalis was still as much of "a novelty" as had been the case around the year 13oo when Francesco da Barberino wrote his Documenti d'Amore. In fact, Filarete himself made it very manifest how proud he was of his innovation which he called "a worthy and memorable enterprise, not yet undertaken in any other place."' It is worth noticing that while Francesco da Barberino, in his discussion of the problem of virtus generalis, had abided by the mediaeval tradition in so far as he avoided any reference in his Documenti d'Amore to the choice of Hercules, Filarete, in his search for previous representations of the single or supreme virt&amp; and vitio, did recall it.

MOMMSEN studies had made so much progress that Filarete could not only tell the story but could allude to its Greek version in Xenophon's Memorabilia.1 This observation brings us back to Petrarch who, one generation later than Fran- cesco da Barberino, first revived that tale, in two places in his De vita solitaria. The first of these passages (I, 4, 2) reads as follows: "It were an excellent thing, if want of counsel, the unavoidable concomitant of youth, did not stand in the way, that each one of us at the very beginning of his maturity should give careful and earnest thought to the selection of some particular kind of life, nor ever turn aside from the path he had once chosen, except for important reasons or for some grave necessity; Hercules did so on entering manhood as is testified by Xenophon, the pupil of Socrates, and by Cicero."2 Petrarch did not know Greek, and Xenophon had not yet been translated into Latin. Therefore Petrarch's source of information was exclusively Cicero's De officiis (1, 32, 118; 3, 5, 25). When he very learnedly cited Xenophon as his first authority, he derived that knowledge also from Cicero and not from any personal acquaintance with the Memorabilia; there are many similar examples of this method of indirect quotation to be found in Petrarch's writings. It will be noted that in this first passage Petrarch referred to the decision made by Hercules only in a rather general fashion, without any indication of the specific choice between the two ways of life, personified as they were in Cicero's account by virtus and voluptas. And it is interesting to observe that somewhat later in the same chapter Petrarch expressed the problem of finding the right way in an entirely Christian fashion and not at all in the terms of pagan antiquity: "If a man has been illumined by the celestial light at his very entrance into life, when, as I have already said, not a spark of judgment is active, and if he has been able to find a safe road or one whose dangers are slight and easily avoided, he has reason for everlasting gratitude to God."3 In the second passage of De vita solitaria (2, 9, 4), Petrarch spoke about people of the past who loved solitude. After a brief discussion of Romulus and Achilles he said: "Hercules too attained in solitude that wholesome plan of life which I have mentioned in the preceding book [I, 4, 2], when, hesi- tating long and much as though at a parting of the ways, he ultimately spurned 1 That Filarete derived his account from Xenophon's text and not from the Latin version of the story in Cicero's De officiis, is clearly shown by a comparison of the text in the Trattato d'Architettura with that in the Memorabilia (2, I, 21-34). 2 Quoted from the excellent translation of Petrarch's Life of Solitude, which was made by J. Zeitlin, Urbana, Ill., 1924, p. I33; the Latin text, in Petrarch's Opera, Basle, 1581, p. 234, reads as follows: "Optimum quidem esset, nisi consilii inopia iugis adolescentiae comes obstaret, ut ab ineunte aetate circa unum aliquod vitae genus apprehendendum unusquisque nostrum accuratissime cogitaret nec ab illo calle, quem semel elegisset, nisi magnis ex causis aut gravi necessitate di- verteret. Quod initio pubertatis fecisse Herculem auctor Xenophon ille Socraticus testis est et Cicero"; see also A. Altamura's edition of De vita solitaria, Naples, 1943, p. 36 f. On the history of the work, see B. L. Ullman, "The composition of Petrarch's De vita solitaria and the history of the Vatican manuscript," Miscellanea Giovanni Mercati, 1946, IV, I07-142. 3 Translat. by Zeitlin, op. cit., p. 133; ed. Opera, 1581, p. 234: "Cui autem in ingressu viae huius, quando ut dixi, scintilla nostri consilii nulla erat, coeleste aliquod lumen affulsit, ut vel securum vel periculi minoris et facile remediabile iter arriperet, habet unde semper Deo gratias agat."</page><page sequence="6">PETRARCH AND THE STORY OF THE CHOICE OF HERCULES 183 the way of pleasure and took possession of the path of virtue, and marching indefatigably along its course, he was raised not only to the apex of human glory but even to a reputation of divinity. Although the fame of this man extends its branches high and wide, if you look for its roots, your mind must turn back to solitude."' It is evident that in this passage Petrarch followed the text of Cicero much more closely than in the earlier one although this time he did not cite his authority. But it was obviously Cicero's text which led him to say that Hercules went into solitude and pondered there for a long while over the question of the right choice, and it was also in accordance with Cicero when Petrarch spoke of the two roads as the ways of virtus and voluptas. Petrarch's remark that Hercules was raised to "the reputation of divinity" likewise agreed with Cicero's statement that "popular belief has given him a place in the council of the Gods."2 But in this second passage in De vita solitaria Petrarch used one very interesting phrase which did not occur in Cicero's text, although one might say that it was implied in it. For whereas Cicero said (De officiis, I, 32, 118) that Hercules "saw two ways," Petrarch stated more explicitly that the hero found himself "as it was in bivio," at a parting of the ways. The assumption seems warranted that Petrarch inserted this particular term in bivio because he remembered that it appeared quite regularly in another traditional allegory symbolizing the two ways of life, the concept of "the Pythagorean letter," the Y, which was developed in antiquity and remained alive through- 1 Translat. by Zeitlin, op. cit., p. 286 f.; ed. Opera, 1581, p. 283: "Ipse Hercules in soli- tudine sanum illud consilium vitae coepit, cuius libro priore mentionem feci, quando velut in bivio diu multumque haesitans ad postremum spreta voluptatis via semitam virtutis arripuit, quam indefesse gradiens non ad humanae modo gloriae verticem, sed ad opinionem divinitatis evectus est, quamlibet alte lateque ramos porrigat viri fama, si radicem quaeras, ad solitudinem erit animo recurrendum"; compare the text edited by Altamura, op. cit., p. 137. 2 In the following two passages from Cicero's work, I have italicized those words which Petrarch transcribed in his treatise. De officiis, I, 32, 118: "Nam quod Herculem Pro- dicus dicit, ut est apud Xenophontem, cum primum pubesceret, quod tempus a natura ad deli- gendum, quam quisque viam vivendi sit ingressurus, datum est, exisse in solitudinem atque ibi sedentem diu secum multumque dubitasse, cum duas cerneret vias, unam Voluptatis, alteram Virtutis, utram in- gredi melius esset, hoc Herculi 'lovis satu edito' potuit fortasse contingere, nobis non item, qui imitamur, quos cuique visum est, atque ad eorum studia institutaque impellimur." De ofciis, 3, 5, 25: "Itemque magis est secundum naturam pro omnibus gentibus, si fieri possit, conservandis aut iuvandis maxi- mos labores molestiasque suscipere imitantem Herculem illum, quem hominum fama benefi- ciorum memor in concilio caelestium collocavit, quam vivere in solitudine non modo sine ullis molestiis, sed etiam in maximis voluptatibus abundantem omnibus copiis, ut excellas etiam pulchritudine et viribus." It may be noted that Petrarch, though following the text of Cicero in other respects, deviated on one rather personal point very markedly from his authority. For, whereas Cicero declared it to be "more in accord with nature to emu- late Hercules and undergo the greatest toil and trouble for the sake of aiding or saving the world, if possible, than to live in solitude, not only free from all care but revelling in pleasures . . .", Petrarch, in accord with his high praise of the solitary life in his treatise of this title, asserted explicitly that, "if you look for the roots of Hercules' fame, your mind must turn back to solitude"; cf. also De vita solitaria, I, 3, 2 (translat. by Zeitlin, p. 125). The English translation of the two passages in De officiis, is that given by W. Miller in The Loeb Classical Library, 1903, pp. 121, 291 f.</page><page sequence="7">184 THEODOR E. MOMMSEN out the Middle Ages.' For instance, in the second part of the fourth century, Servius wrote in his Commentarii in Vergilii Aeneidos: "As we know, Pythagoras of Samos divided human life according to the form of the letter Y; in the uncertainty of early age men have not yet given themselves to virtues and vices; but the parting of the ways (bivium), [symbolized by the two upper shafts] of the letter Y, begins with adolescence at the time when men follow either the vices, that is the left side, or the virtues, that is the right side."2 The allegorical meaning of the bivium as illustrated by the Y was interpreted in a very similar fashion by Ausonius, St. Jerome and Martianus Capella.3 The allegory met, however, also with pronounced opposition among some early Christian theologians, as Lactantius' Divine Institutes shows. Lactantius knew that the pagan philosophers had spoken of the two ways and "repre- sented the one as belonging to the virtues, the other to the vices," but he objected that "these men because they were ignorant or in doubt in regard to the fact that the souls of men are immortal, evaluated both virtues and vices in terms of earthly honours or punishments."4 He also remembered that "they say that the course of human life resembles the letter Y," but again he rejected the purely secular interpretation of that symbol by which "they referred the end of those ways to the body, and to this life which we lead on earth."5 Lactantius granted that the poets had perhaps more correctly dealt with that bivium than the philosophers had done,6 but nevertheless he felt obliged to ask "what need is there of the letter Y" in a matter, the choice of the right 1 On this concept see especially C.

For instance, Isidore of Seville declared in his Etymologiae: "Pythagoras of Samos was the first to form the letter Y as an example of human life. For its lower shaft signifies early age in its uncertainty, which has not yet given itself either to the vices or the virtues. The bivium, however, which is above, starts with adolescence; its right side is steep but reaches to the blessed life; the left side is easier but leads down to fall and ruin."3 This inclusion of the traditional concept of the Y in Isidore's encyclopaedia probably accounts for the great popularity which the symbol enjoyed from the Carolingian era to the end of the Middle Ages. As Manitius has stated, it became quite a common practice to use the phrase ad Pythagoricae litterae bivium pervenire.4 For example, the Friar Salimbene of Parma said in his Cronica that he entered the Franciscan Order at the age of fifteen years, "when I arrived at the parting of the ways of the Pythagorean letter."5 In the fourteenth century, Richard de Bury, writing in his Philobiblon, accused the corrupt clergy of his era in the following words: "At last, yielding your lives to wickedness and reaching the parting of the ways of the Pythagorean figure, you choose the left branch and, turning backward, forsake the lot of the Lord, which you had first chosen, and become partakers with thieves."6 1 Div.

Instit., 6, 3, I4: "Has igitur uias longe aliter inducimus, quam induci a philo- sophis solent, primum quod utrique prae- positum esse dicimus ducem utrumque in- mortalem, sed alterum honoratum, qui uir- tutibus ac bonis praesit, alterum damnatum, qui uitiis ac malis."

MOMMSEN Petrarch was well acquainted with the traditional interpretation of the symbol Y. Thus he advised a friend who had started on a political career not to despair of his final salvation for that reason, "as if you had chosen the devious and, as the Pythagoreans call it, the left road."' In a letter in which he recommended his young son Giovanni to the care of the grammarian Giberto Baiardi of Parma, Petrarch wrote that the boy "has come in his life to the Pythagorean bivium: never is there less prudence, never more peril."2 After this allusion Petrarch discussed in the rest of the letter the problem of the two ways very much in Christian terms, beginning with the quotation of the famous passage in St. Matthew (vii. 13-14): "Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat; because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it." But it is very characteristic of Petrarch that within the subsequent string of quotations from the Old Testament concerning the right way of life he inserted also two passages from "our poet," that is, from Vergil's Aeneid.3 In one of his Epistles, Petrarch likewise talked about the two ways of life, "one lofty and hard" which leads to the life eternal but is chosen only by the very few, the other extending in "a deep valley" and leading to Tartarus or, as he said in a later line, to eternal death. "What is it," Petrarch asked, "that compels men, at the bivium of the old man of Samos, to deviate to the left side and to hold the right path in such contempt?"4 The most interesting discussion of the meaning of the letter Y is to be found in a letter which Petrarch addressed to Zanobi da Strada. He described "that grave matter placed before those who are entering the way of life," the choice of "the path which is more to the right, steep and narrow, thorny and stony." This path, Petrarch explained in Christian terms, is the narrow way to "the true life," whereas the left road, and here Petrarch again quoted Vergil, "wreaks punishment of the wicked and sends them on to pitiless Tartarus." Petrarch continued: "Neither our Maro was ignorant of this nor et retrorsum abeuntes, sortem Domini prae- assumptam dimittitis, socii facti furum"; see also West's explanatory note, ibid., III, 109. 1 Famil., 3, I2, 5: "Tu igitur ne desperes, quasi devium et, ut Pithagorici vocant, levum iter ingressus sis, aut quasi tuorum cura civium, quam geris, divine quam petis gratie sit adversa." 2Famil., 7, 17, I: "Adolescentulum nos- trum, consilii inopem et etatis agitatum stimulis, paterne solicitudinis ope com- plectere.

Pascal, op. cit., p. 64 f.</page><page sequence="10">PETRARCH AND THE STORY OF THE CHOICE OF HERCULES 187 was Pythagoras when he, following the steps of Cadmus, hammered out on the anvil of his mind that letter which, though superfluous as far as writing goes, is useful for life."' It is clear that in this passage, as in the previous one, Petrarch supported the allegorical significance of the Pythagorean letter with references to both the Christian and the classical traditions. But this time he commented on the meaning of the symbol in still another and, it seems, entirely personal and original fashion. "The two-horned form of the letter" he found to be "of exemplary value." For, "with its right horn, though it is narrower, the letter reaches to the stars, whereas on the left side the letter is broader but, through the curve of the horn on that side, is bent toward the earth."2 The editor of Petrarch's Familiari, Vittorio Rossi, has most ingeniously pointed out that for the correct understanding of this passage one has to realize that Petrarch wrote his Y in exactly the same manner in which he described it in this letter: one shaft was drawn in a rather thin stroke, turned somewhat to the right but pointed upward; the left shaft was much broader but on its top the curve was pointed downward.3 This particular interpretation of the Y, then, was just as much in accordance with Petrarch's handwriting as the explanation of the symbolism of that letter, given by Persius and other Latin writers of antiquity, agreed with their practice of writing it. In their case, "the right way" was represented by the straight main shaft from which the left shaft forked off, at first in a slight angle but after that also going straight up.4 Thus they could say that the right path rises very steeply and that the ascent on the wrong road seems at first easy and offers its real difficulties only along its later course. But these ancients could not say that the left way ultimately pointed toward a downfall, as Petrarch was to abstract from his own calligraphical usage. Original though Petrarch was in this specific interpretation of the allegori- cal significance of the form of the letter Y, in other respects he adhered to the conception of the bivium, which had been customary throughout the Middle Ages. For the above three passages in the Familiari and the lines in the Epistola metrica indicate clearly that the idea of the parting of the ways was to him symbolized primarily by the Pythagorean letter and was in no way connected with the choice of Hercules, which he did not mention at all in those four places. On the other hand, when he resolved, for the only time, it seems, in his own writings, and for the first time in western literature since antiquity, 1 Famil., I 2, 3, 5-6: "Sentis ... illud grande discrimen, illud grave negotium, quod in- trantibus viam vite huius obicitur: longum iter asperumque, breve tempus et adversum; dexterior trames arduus angustus vepricosus scrupeus; ea nobis ad veram vitam semita est; 'at leva malorum / Exercet penas et ad impia Tartara mittit' [Aen., 6, 542-5431]; quod nec Maro noster ignorat nec Pythagoras ignorabat, dum Cadmi vestigiis insistens scripture supervacuam, sed vite utilem literam in incude ingenii mallearet."

Dornseiff, op. cit., pp. 5 f., 8, 13 f., 24, 114, 170. 2 Famil., 12, 3, 7: "Bicornis et exemplaris litera dextro cornu arctior tendit ad sidera, levo latior in terram curvata reflectitur; ea, ut aiunt, ad inferos est via, et illa quidem incessu letior ac dulcior, exitu mestissima atque amarissima est, et cuius omnino nil possit miserie superaddi; dextrum vero iter ingressis ut labor ingens sic finis optimus." 3 See V. Rossi's note in Vol. III, p. 18, of his edition of Petrarch's Le Familiari (with a facsimile showing the form in which Petrarch wrote the letter Y). 4 This observation was made by J.

MOMMSEN to include in his treatise De vita solitaria the story of that choice, he put into his account the phrase in bivio, which did not occur in his source, Cicero's De oficiis, but was well known to him through the mediaeval saying ad Pythagoricae litterae bivium pervenire. By combining two literary traditions which in ancient times had been related though never completely tied together, Petrarch was the first, it appears, to coin the phrase Hercules in bivio, which for his own era was a real novelty but finally became quite proverbial in Italian as well as in German.1 When Coluccio Salutati wrote his long letter to Giovanni of Siena com- menting on Seneca's tragedy Hercules furens, which he later elaborated into the treatise De laboribus Herculis,2 he included the story of the decision made by the hero in his youth, without taking cognizance, however, of the fact that the tale had made a previous reappearance in Petrarch's De vita solitaria.3 Salutati took his account from the passage in the first book of De officiis and did not refer to the other passage in the third book of the same work. He felt obviously somewhat uncertain about the truthfulness of the story, for he con- cluded his quotation from Cicero with the words: "Whether this is true, I cannot otherwise ascertain." But after this cautious remark he added that "a man of the greatest authority, Basilius, testifies" to the moral lesson of the story as it had been taught by Prodicus and related by Xenophon and Cicero.4 In this allusion Salutati referred to a passage in St. Basil's treatise De legendis gentilium libris, a work known to him through the Latin translation which Leonardo Bruni Aretino had just made and dedicated to him.5 For the rest 1 See, e.g., the title of an opera by J. A. Hasse, Alcide al bivio, which was performed in 1760 with a libretto written by Metastasio (Opere, VIII, 1781, pp. 207-248) ; cf. Panofsky, op. cit., p. 134 ff.; see ibid., pp. 42 and 48.

F. Novati, I, I80, and IV, I35). In his writings on Hercules, according to the index in Ullman's edition, Salutati referred only to one work of Petrarch, the De remediis utriusque fortunae; his ignorance of Petrarch's "Life of Hercules" is explained by the fact that Salutati's manuscript of De viris illustribus did not contain the non-Roman biographies of the earlier version; cf. G. Martellotti, "I1 codice Ottoboniano 1883 e l'opera di Lom- bardo della Seta nella tradizione manoscritta del De viris illustribus," Convivium, 1947, pp- 739-752; G. Billanovich, Petrarca letterato, Rome, 1947, I, 322. 4 Salutati, De laboribus Herculis, 3, 7, 1, quoted the passage in Cicero's De officiis, 3, 32, 118, from the words "Herculem Prodicus dicit" to "utram ingredi melius esset" (see Cicero's text, p. 183 above, note 2) and then continued: "Hec ille. Quod an verum fuerit, aliter compertum non habeo"; after that Salutati said (3, 7, 2): "Miror tamen, licet hoc idem testetur maxime autoritatis Basi- lius.. ." (ed.

This uniqueness stands in marked contrast to Petrarch's customary habit of alluding time and again in his writings and, above all, in his correspondence, to those historical or legendary figures and events, stories and anecdotes, which allowed him to draw moral lessons from them. In order to account for the apparent reserve which he maintained in regard to that particular tale, it may be permissible to assume that he was conscious of the fact that, from the strictly Christian point of view, the story was somewhat problematic. When Petrarch wrote his De vita solitaria, he knew Lactantius's works and he must have remembered the passage in The Divine Institutes (6, 3, 9), in which Lactantius protested sharply against the pagans who "referred the end of those two ways to the body, and to the life which we lead on earth."2 To be sure, Lactantius had also said that the one path was the via virtutis and that on the other way "cupidity and pleasure (voluptas) dragged men headlong;"3 but at the same time Lactantius had made it very clear what in the eyes of a true Christian ought to be the nature of "the two ways which God has assigned to human life: . . . in the one case God has pointed out that there will be first temporal evils which will be followed by eternal goods ...; in the other, first temporal goods which will be followed by eternal evils."4 The goal reached by Petrarch's Hercules in bivio was very different indeed; for after "Hercules had spurned the way of voluptas and taken possession of the path of virtus, ... he was raised to the apex of human glory."'5 Petrarch must have realized that to Lactantius, as well as to any other Christian thinker, "human glory" represented merely a temporal good and certainly not that "gloria that cometh from God alone."' Therefore 1 The sources used by Salutati (3, 7, 3) in his discussion of the Pythagorean letter were identical with those quoted by Petrarch in the same connexion: Persius, Sat., 3, 56 f.; Servius, Ad Aeneid., 6, 136; Vergil, Aen., 6, 541-543; see also De laboribus Herculis, 4, part 2, ch. 9, 3 (ed. Ullman, p. 572). The passage in the letter to Giovanni da Siena (2, 59, ed. Ullman, op. cit., p. 635) reads as follows: "Cum itaque in illo bivio tum carnis sarcina ab illa virtutis ardua et arcta via deterreretur, et voluntate apud terrena detenta ad de- clivem sinistram viam voluptatis invitaretur, Hercules noster rate, hoc est voluntate, relicta virtutem eligendo suggestionibus carnis supe- ratis emersit." SSee above, p. 184, n. 5. On Petrarch's knowledge of Lactantius, compare P. de Nolhac, Pitrarque et I'humanisme, Paris, 1907, I, 183 f., 259 n. 3; II, I1I, 184, I90 n. 4, 211 f.; see also, s.v. "Lattanzio," in the indices of Billanovich's edition of Rerum Memorandarum Libri, and of Rossi's and Bosco's edition of Le Familiari, the many references to passages in which Petrarch quoted from the Divinae Institutiones. 3 Divin. Instit., 6, 4, I: "Una est itaque uirtutis ac bonorum uia ..."; ibid., 6, 4, 10o: "Omnes . . . quos cupiditas aut uoluptas praecipites trahit. .." 4 Divin.

MOMMSEN it seems very likely that he refrained quite consciously from emphasizing the story of Hercules in bivio too strongly and too frequently in his writings. In spite of the personal reserve which Petrarch may have felt, his revival of the story appears to be hardly accidental but quite logical, both within the whole context of his own writings and within the general frame-work of the history of the ideas marking the period of transition from mediaeval to Renais- sance thought. For the tale implied a basic maxim which is characteristic of one of the aspects of Petrarch's thinking as well as of that of the generations following him: the demand that every man, on reaching in his life the fateful point of the parting of the ways, ought to choose, as Hercules had done, the right path, that of virtus, through which he will obtain fame. As Panofsky showed, the concept of a supreme Virtue had no proper place within the mediaeval moral system, and it was only in the fifteenth century that "the ancient concept of virtus as a state of perfection in this world was re-established to its full extent and at the same time reconciled with the Christian dogma: no longer was it considered to be a diminution of the divine omnipotence but on the contrary its most profound confirmation that in the centre of the universe stood the free man-free, not any longer because of the aid of heavenly grace but because of his innate virtus."l To a certain degree Petrarch anticipated that idea of the later humanists although he still con- ceived of it in a somewhat unsystematical fashion since classical and Christian notions often appeared in his work side by side and had not yet become really integrated.2 This is especially true of his concept of virtus. On one side it would be easy to quote many passages in his writings in which he defined virtus or virtutes in complete accordance with the traditional views of the Middle Ages. On the other side, almost as frequently it seems, he set forth a concept of virtus, which definitely foreshadowed the later concept of virt~.3 For instance, Petrarch, like many humanists after him, recalled Cicero's state- ment that the word virtus is derived from vir, that is to say that virtus is that quality which makes a human being into a man in the fullest sense.4 "Through the might of virtus," Petrarch wrote in his Apologia contra cuiusdam Galli calumnias, "do outstanding men conquer everything."6 The same fervent belief in the power of virtis manifests itself in the famous lines of the canzone Italia mia: "vertfi contra furore prenderi l'arme ... ," with which Machiavelli was to conclude Il Principe. Virtus was the basic theme of Petrarch's main historical work, the De viris illustribus. As he made it clear in the preface to that book, the great men of history were to him the embodiments of virtus; they were a solo Deo est, non quaeritis?"; compare St. Paul's Epistle to the Hebrews ii. 6-9. 1 Panofsky, op. cit., p. 164. 2 This peculiar feature of Petrarch's thought has been very well characterized by Panofsky, op. cit., p. 165 n. 4, with the remark that Petrarch "hier wie uberall die Renaissance- Anschauung in einer eigentuimlich zart- verschleierten, man m6chte sagen: noch nicht dogmatisierten Gestalt an den Tag treten last." 3 On the history of that idea, compare, e.g., E. W. Mayer, Machiavellis Geschichtsauffassung und sein Begriff virtih, 1 9 2 ; I. Wyss, Virtit und Fortuna bei Boiardo und Ariosto, i93 1. 4 Famil., 23, 2, 28: "At profecto sive 'a viro virtus,' ut vult Cicero [Tusc., 2, 18, 431], sive a virtute vir dicitur, nil hac vere viro carius, nil amabilius esse potest."

But the fact is that in his work De viris illustribus he never, either explicitly or implicitly, derived virtus from God, as St. Augustine and every other Christian theologian had done very specifi- cally. Thus he provided no answer to the fundamental question as to who was ultimately responsible for the power which he considered the most important driving force in history. Through this omission he leaves his readers with the impression that he believed that a truly "illustrious" man, who by his own choice is possessed of virtus, is able to shape his own destiny, as well as being the maker of history. Such a conception was indeed highly secular and did not at all conform with the mediaeval tradition according to which all history is ruled over by God. Only one generation before Petrarch, Dante had still called the great men of Rome "instruments through which Divine Providence proceeded in the Roman Empire where many times the arm of God was seen to be present."4 In the story of Hercules in bivio, as told in De vita solitaria, the hero who chose the path of virtus was ultimately "raised to the apex of human glory." This close relationship and interdependence existing between virtus and gloria is again one of Petrarch's favourite ideas, which found expression in many of his writings and, above all, in his historical work. By his very definition of the topic of De viris illustribus he called only those men "illustrious" whose virtus enabled them to achieve true fame through great deeds.5 Glory repres- ented to Petrarch "the companion and herald of virtus."6 In one of his canzoni, gloria is pictured as "una donna pici bella assai che '1 sole," who 1 See the preface to the first version of De viris illustribus, ed. P. de Nolhac, Notices et extraits des manuscrits de la Bibliothdque Nationale, XXXIV, I89I, pp. I 10-114, esp. lines 69-72: "Neque enim quisquis opulentus et potens confestim simul illustris est; alter enim for- tune, alter virtutis et glorie munus est, neque ego fortunatos, sed illustres sum pollicitus viros describere." 2 In Famil., 13, 4, 1 2, Petrarch enumerated a number of great Roman war leaders who could not have achieved their deeds, "nisi eos spectata virtus . .. duces perpetuos reipublice debitos ac necessarios elegisset coegissetque sub armis evum agere;" see also, ibid., the phrase: "quisquis es, qui virtutis specie illec- tus eius contubernium concupiscis, scito rem te maximam optare neque parvo parabilem, sed que totum te poscat in precium." 8 See above, p. 179, note 3. 4 Dante, Convivio, 4, "5, 17: "e manifesto esser dee, questi eccellentissimi essere stati strumenti, con li quali procedette la divina provedenza ne lo romano imperio, dove piu volte parve esse braccia di Dio essere pre senti." 5 See above, note i. 6 Famil., 9, I I, 3: "Hoc nimirum interest, quod ut nos ipsos quos non vidimus amemus, natura est; ut alios, virtus facit et fama, vir- tutis comes ac nuntia"; see also Famil., I, 2, 25: ". .. virtutem fama, ceu solidum corpus umbra, consequitur" (cf.

MOMMSEN reveals to the poet the personification of virthi, "che farh gli occhi tuoi via pih felici."1 It seems worth noticing that in the Documenti d'Amore Francesco da Barberino set forth a very similar idea by declaring in regard to the virtus moralis in genere: "It is that virtus which increases the fame of every man."' Just as Francesco da Barberino had been the first artist since the days of antiquity to attempt to create an image of the supreme or "general" Virtue, so a generation later Petrarch revived the memory of the ancient story in which Hercules in bivio figured as the representative of the truly "illustrious" man, that highest type of man who by his own free decision chooses the path of virtus on which he will ascend to the peak of earthly glory. These were novel ideas which form, in Panofsky's words, "a part in that great process which we still may define as Rinascimento dell'Antichitd."a The full develop- ment of these concepts was left to the later writers and artists of the Renais- sance. 1Le Rime, CXIX, lines I and 60o; cf.
