<plain_text><page sequence="1">Joseph Ibn Kaspi on the Book of Job Robert Eisen Joseph ibn Kaspi (b. 1280) was a significant philosopher-exegete in med- ieval Judaism. Born in Provence, he produced over twenty works most of which were biblical commentaries. Like many Jewish philosophers in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Kaspi advanced the exegetical pro- gram set forth by Maimonides in his Guide of the Perplexed by compos- ing commentaries on the Bible in a philosophical vein. However, like many of his cohorts in medieval Jewish philosophy, Kaspi has not fared well in modern scholarship. Relatively little work has been done on him.1 Kaspi's philosophical orientation can be characterized as radical. He belonged to the same wing of medieval Jewish philosophical thought that produced such thinkers as Gersonides and Moses Narboni, a group that drew inspiration from Maimonides and Averroes, and believed that in the writings of the two great masters one could find the true doctrines 1 Little is known about Kaspi's life. He was born in the town of Argentière. This explains the name "Kaspi" which is from the Hebrew kesef meaning "silver," an allu- sion to the French argent. The date of his death is not known but was sometime after 1332 which is the last year explicitly referred to in any of his works. What we know about Kaspi's life and literary activity is discussed in the following studies: Moritz Steinschneider, "Joseph Kaspi," Gesammelte Schriften, eds.

Those doctrines supported a thorough-going Aristotelianism which upheld an impersonal conception of God.2 Yet, it was not in philosophy that Kaspi displayed originality, but in exegesis. He was highly creative in interpreting the biblical text in light of his radical philosophical outlook. That his originality should be in the area of exegesis should not surprise us given that the vast majority of his works were biblical commentaries. Clearly, exegesis was his primary interest.3 Kaspi is also difficult to read. He adopts an esoteric and elusive style of writing at the inspiration of his two mentors, Maimonides and Aver- roes, in an attempt to conceal his true philosophical views. It was com- mon for medieval Islamic and Jewish philosophers to hide their views on philosophical matters when they perceived them to be radical and thus potentially injurious to the common reader who knew nothing of philo- sophy. They concealed their positions with a number of techniques, such as deliberately abbreviating their statements, couching their opinions in the form of innuendo, or even expressing views that were the opposite of what they believed. This method of writing was made famous in medie- val Jewish philosophy by Maimonides and was adopted by many of his followers, particularly in the wake of the controversy over his writings that erupted in the decades following his death in 1204.4 Yet, those who expend the effort on Kaspi's writings are richly rewarded. They are 2 In my overall approach toward Kaspi, I support those who consistently read Kas- pi as a radical Aristotelian-Averroist. These include Hannah Kasher, Barry Mesch (see especially, pp. 96-106), and Isaiah Dimant, "Exegesis, Philosophy and Language in the Writing of Joseph lbn Caspi," (Ph. D. diss., University of California, Los Angeles, 1979). This view is not unanimous. Cf. Twersky, p. 251 n. 23, who appears to reject this approach. Cf. also Herring's discussion of Kaspi's views on miracles, pp. 99-124, which takes Kaspi's assertions regarding divine intervention into the natural order as expressions of his true view. More convincing is Kasher's contention that such state- ments conceal a thoroughly naturalistic understanding of miracles. See Kasher, "Joseph ibn Kaspi as Philosophical Exegete," pp. 76-83, and her notes to the fourth and fifth sections of Shulhan Kesef, pp. 189-210. See also Dimant, pp. 131-44 who takes a simi- lar approach to Kaspi's views on miracles. 3 For a discussion of Kaspi's hermeneutics, see Herring, pp. 33-76; Kasher, "Joseph ibn Kaspi as Philosophical Exegete," pp. 19-38, 103^4; Shalom Rosenberg, "Logic, Language, and Biblical Exegesis in the Writings of Joseph ibn Kaspi" (in Hebrew), Religion and Language, eds.

Compounding the problem of Kaspi's difficult style is the fact that the printed editions of Kaspi's works are inadequately edited. The exceptions are Herring's critical edition and English translation of Geviae Kesef and Kasher's recently published critical edition of Shulhan Kesef.</page><page sequence="3">52 Robert Eisen JSQ 13 among the most colorful in medieval Jewish philosophy. In attempting to hide his ideas from the masses, Kaspi exhibits a keen sense of sar- casm, mischief, and playfulness. The subject of the present discussion is Kaspi's interpretation of the Book of Job. Kaspi wrote two commentaries on this text which were both published by Isaac Last, an early twentieth-century scholar most responsible for the publication of Kaspi's works. They appear in eAsarah Keley Kesef, one of a number of Last's collections of Kaspi's works.5 Kaspi describes the second commentary as an abridgement of the first, and therefore the first is conventionally referred to as Kaspi's long com- mentary on Job while the second is referred to as the short commentary.6 The two commentaries will require a lengthy analysis. While Kaspi's esoteric writing is often elusive and obscure, his commentaries on Job are, to my mind, unusually difficult in this regard. They are a minefield of ambiguities, innuendos, and contradictions that demand a great deal from the reader. Much effort will therefore be needed to unlock their meaning. Moreover, we have two commentaries, not just one. Thus, we not only have to figure out what each is saying, but what the relationship is between them. Given the difficulty of these works and the complex analysis they will require, perhaps a few words are in order about the overall direction of my discussion. My analysis owes much to Hannah Kasher, perhaps the 5 'Asarah Keley Kesef, ed. Isaac Last (Pressburg: Alkalay, 1905), vol. 1, pp. 133-179. 6 Kaspi describes the short commentary on Job as an abridgment of the first in the short commentary itself. See the short commentary on Job (henceforth SCJ), p. 160. There is some confusion about the names of the two commentaries. We have two versions of his auto-bibliographical essay, Kevutsat Kesef, which were apparently writ- ten at different points of his life, and the commentaries on Job are given different names in each: Shulhan Kesef m the earlier version, and Mizmorot Kesef m the later one. Yet, in the commentaries themselves no such names are mentioned. Mesch devotes an entire chapter to a translation and discussion of this essay. See Mesch, pp. 7-42, especially, pp. 14 and 28, which mention the commentaries on Job. - We cannot date the two commentaries on Job, a problem that we have for most of Kaspi's works. Kasher surmises that they were probably written relatively early in his career since in his long commentary he explicitly mentions only Sefer Ha-Sod and Sefer Ha-Matsref as "the rest of my works" (long commentary on Job, henceforth LCJ, p. 135). These are older names for Kaspi's two Torah commentaries which are later called Tirat Kesef and Matsref La-Kesef (Kasher, Shulhan Kesef p. 22). There is evidence, however, that Kaspi continued to edit his works throughout his career. We have numerous instances in which two works will refer to the other. Thus, for instance, Gevia' Kesef and Matsref La-Kesef both mention each other (e. g., Matsref La-Kesef, in Mishneh Kesef ed. Isaac Last [Cracow: Fisher, 1906], vol. 2, p. 9; Gevia' Kesef, p. 159). Therefore, it is question- able whether we can determine an early date for the Job commentaries. For problems in the dating of Kaspi's works, see Kasher, "Joseph ibn Kaspi as Philosophical Exegete," pp. 5-6.</page><page sequence="4">(2006) Joseph Ihn Kaspi on the Book of Job 53 foremost expert on Kaspi, who has devoted a brief but informative ar- ticle to Kaspi's commentaries on Job.7 Yet, I will depart from Kasher on a number of points. Most significantly, Kasher argues that the first com- mentary is esoteric and Aristotelian in its orientation while the second is exoteric and is written for the masses. While I believe that the first com- mentary is certainly a more esoteric commentary than the second, I will show that both commentaries in fact contain esoteric and exoteric ele- ments. The key to understanding Kaspi's commentaries on Job, I will argue, lies in how he relates to Maimonides in these works. Both of Kaspi's commentaries largely consist of a critique of Maimonides' reading of the Book of Job and his overall theory of providence in The Guide of the Perplexed. Yet, a close examination will reveal that his disagreements with Maimonides are part of a clever strategy of concealment. In almost every place in which Kaspi critiques Maimonides, he provides clues in- dicating that he, in fact, agrees with his predecessor! It is in discerning this strategy, which is fairly consistent throughout the two works, that one gets critical insight into Kaspi's method. It may frustrate the reader, however, that my analysis will not produce a comprehensive understanding of how Kaspi actually understood the Book of Job. Kaspi seems to have been more intent on concealing his views than revealing them. While he hints at agreement with Maimo- nides throughout his commentaries, it is not clear how he interpreted him. The result is that it is practically impossible to discern what Kaspi actually thought about the Book of Job. The question of why Kaspi in this instance chose to conceal his views so thoroughly is an interesting question in its own right and it is one we will need to address. Yet, even if Kaspi's commentaries do not provide as much information on the content of Job as one might have hoped, they are interesting specimens of esoteric writing in medieval Judaism. They also offer important in- sight into the particular strategies that Kaspi used to conceal his philo- sophical views. Given the centrality of Maimonides' reading of Job to that Kaspi, it is imperative that we briefly summarize his discussion - a daunting task given its notorious difficulty. Maimonides' interpretation of Job is part of a section of the Guide that deals with the subject of providence.8 7 "Joseph ibn Kaspi's Aristotelian Interpretation and Fundamentalist Interpreta- tion of the Book of Job" (in Hebrew), Da at 20 (1988): 117-25. 8 My summary here draws from my study, The Book oj Job in Medieval Jewish Philosophy (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), chapter 3, in which I provide a detailed examination of Maimonides' reading of Job.</page><page sequence="5">54 Robert Eisen JSQ 13 Maimonides recounts five theories of providence proposed by previous schools: that of Epicurus, Aristotle, the Mucatizilites, the Ashcarites, and the view of "the Law," or the traditional Jewish view.9 Maimonides' own view combines the opinion of Aristotle with the Jewish view. Aristotle holds that God exercises providence over the various species, but not over their individual members. The Jewish view is that the principle governing God's relationship with the world is justice; the good fortune people experience is always reward for good deeds, while their suffering is always punishment for sin. According to Maimonides, Aristotle is correct with respect to all species in the sublunar realm except for hu- man beings who are governed by providence as dictated by the Jewish view. Thus, only human beings experience individual providence, and for them, as the Jewish position tells us, the principle of justice applies: good fortune is reward for good deeds, while bad fortune is punishments for sin.10 Maimonides goes on to describe the metaphysical mechanism respon- sible for individual providence. Human beings alone experience this spe- cial type of providence because of their intellects which distinguish them from all other species. It is through the intellect that human beings re- ceive "divine overflow," the divine energy which spills over into the world via the chain of Separate Intellects.11 However, providence is not the same for all people in that it is graded according to the perfection of one's intellect. The greater one's intellectual perfection, the greater the divine overflow one receives and therefore the greater one's providence.12 Much is unclear here. At first, Maimonides supports the traditional view of "the Law" that God simply rewards and punishes individual human beings according to their deeds. But once he begins to discuss the mechanism of providence and formulates the notion of providence as consequent upon the intellect, it would seem that he is proposing a more naturalistic conception. Maimonides never tells us precisely what that conception is, but commentators from the medieval period onward have repeatedly suggested a number of possibilities. One is that the more developed an intellect one has the more one is able to maximize his well- being by consistently making intelligent decisions regarding future ac- 9 Guide of the Perplexed, trans. Shlomo Pines (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963), 111:17, pp. 464-9. The "Law" refers to the Torah and is Pines's translation of the term sharVa. In Maimonides sharVa can refer to any law, divine or nomic, but in the passages we will be discussing, it always refers to the Torah. 10 Guide 111:17. dd.471^. 11 Guide 111:17, pp. 471-2, 474. 12 Guide 111:18, pp. 474-7.</page><page sequence="6">(2006) Joseph Ihn Kaspi on the Book of Job 55 tion. A second possibility is that the more developed a person's intellect, the more he will be able to achieve moral virtue, which in Maimonides' thinking involves the regulation of one's habits according to the princi- ple of the Aristotelian mean. Moral virtue, in turn, leads to better phy- sical health which again results in greater well-being. A third possibility emerges from Maimonides' discussion of Job. Ac- cording to Maimonides, the Book of Job is an allegory designed to im- part secrets about the doctrine of providence. Job's physical suffering is emblematic of all human suffering and is due to privation. Privation is the absence of a natural form in an object that might normally possess it and it is therefore the natural force responsible for the process of decay and corruption in the physical world.13 It is this force which is repre- sented by Satan who causes Job's suffering.14 Job's dialogue with his friends reflects the positions of the five schools on providence enumerated earlier, and it is the view of Elihu which turns out to be Maimonides' own. According to this view, Job toward the end of the dialogue was able to escape the effects of Satan, or privation by achieving intellectual perfection and experiencing individual providence. That perfection safeguarded Job from suffering because it allowed him to develop the ability to engage in the constant contemplation of God which confers an inner psychological resistance to suffering. According to Maimonides' reading of Job, intellectual perfection thus results in providence by allowing an individual to bask in the pleasure of contem- plating the Deity so that one becomes impervious to physical affliction. One does not so much circumvent suffering as learn to manage its ill effects.15 What is important to realize is that all these manifestations of provi- dence require no personal God who intervenes in human events. Divine providence is 'divine' only in the tenuous sense that the human intellect is connected to God through the Active Intellect, and it is the human intellect which saves a person from harm. Nor does God really reward and punish. In some sense, one rewards and punishes oneself according to the degree of effort invested in perfecting one's intellect which deter- mines one's level of providence according to each of the possibilities just 1 3 Thus, for instance, an eye that is blind experiences the privation of sight since the eye in its normal state should see but at present lacks that capacity. The concept of privation has its roots in Aristotle. For a discussion of it, see W. K. C. Guthrie, A History of Greek Philosophy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981), vol. 6, pp. 104, 121-2. 14 Guide 111:22, pp. 486-90. 15 Guide 111:23, pp. 490-7.</page><page sequence="7">56 Robert Eisen JSQ 13 described. In his treatment of providence, Maimonides therefore seems to be concealing an esoteric doctrine. This would explain why he begins with a traditional formulation of providence but ends up with a more naturalistic conception. The first is meant to appease the philosophically uneducated reader, while the second represents his true view. We can now begin to examine the long commentary on Job which Kaspi composed before his shorter commentary. He begins this work by apologizing for any criticisms of his predecessors that he will express in the course of his exposition. Such criticisms, he explains, are due to his own shortcomings; they are stated "only to show everyone my defi- ciencies, for I do not understand their words."16 It turns out that in practice Kaspi has but one figure in mind here, and that is Maimonides, for at practically every turn of his commentary, Kaspi voices objection to one or another position that Maimonides has taken. Kaspi's critique of Maimonides, in fact, begins immediately after his apology with a discussion of the latter's theory of providence. Kaspi expresses confusion over a number of points in Maimonides' theory. We need not review the half-dozen or so problems that Kaspi finds in Maimonides' thinking. It is sufficient to note that they tend to revolve around a number of passages in Maimonides' treatment of providence in the Guide in which he assumes that he, the Torah, the early rabbis, and the later rabbis, all have different views on this matter. For example, in Guide, 111:17, Maimonides introduces the view of the Torah on provi- dence as follows: The fifth opinion is our opinion, I mean the opinion of our Law. I shall let you know about it what has been literally stated in the books of our prophets and is believed by the multitude of our scholars; I shall inform you of what is believed by some of our latter-day scholars; and I shall let you know what I myself believe about this.17 Kaspi's difficulty is that the respective views on providence in the Torah, the early rabbis, and Maimonides should all be one and the same. Why then, Kaspi asks, does Maimonides separate them as if they have noth- ing to do with one another? Kaspi is unable to resolve this conundrum.18 There is reason to suspect that Kaspi is concealing something in this discussion. First, we have to be suspicious of Kaspi's expressions of 16 LCJ, p. 135. Kaspi also claims to have made similar statements of apology in his other works, in particular Sefer Ha-Sod and Sefer La-Matsref, his two Torah commen- taries. As noted above (n. 6), these are older names for these commentaries which were later changed. 17 Guide 111:17, p. 469. 18 LCJ, pp. 135-7.</page><page sequence="8">(2006) Joseph Ihn Kaspi on the Book of Job 57 humility in criticizing his predecessors, since we know from his other writings that humility is not one of his virtues. He tends to be quite self-assured of the correctness of his own views.19 Second, there is reason to believe that Kaspi's perplexities about Maimonides' views on provi- dence are more feigned than real and that he understands Maimonides more than he is willing to admit. Kaspi has certainly identified an intri- guing feature of Maimonides' discussion of providence in noting the distinction that he makes between the views in the Torah, the early rabbis, the later rabbis, and those which he himself holds. However, commentators on Maimonides have treated this observation as a good clue that he is alluding to an esoteric doctrine since he appears to be suggesting that his own view of providence is not the traditional one proposed in the Torah or the early rabbis.20 One suspects that Kaspi would agree with these commentators. After all, Kaspi is no stranger to Maimonides' esoteric method of discourse. In his two commentaries on the Guide, he shows great sensitivity to the inconsistencies and anomalies in Maimonides' positions and reads them as pointing to eso- teric positions. Furthermore, Kaspi himself makes use of Maimonides' esoteric method of discourse throughout his own writings. Our suspicions are strengthened by a passage in one of his two com- mentaries on the Guide, "Ammudey Kesef where he explains quite expli- citly why Maimonides divides between his own view on providence and that of the rabbis: ... for the multitude of sages believed one thing with respect to what is written in the Torah and the Prophets, while some of the latter-day sages believed another thing, and Maimonides, another. That is to say, the under- standing of the Torah is divided into [different] interpretations. Evidence [for this] is what the Guide [i. e., Maimonides] will yet say in explaining his own opinion, which is from the perspective of what was evident to him as to the intention of God's Torah and the books of the Prophets. There is no dis- 19 Note, for instance, the "apology" in Sefer Ha-Sod, which Kaspi claims is similar to the apology he is making here in his long commentary on Job (see n. 16 above). The apology in this other work is much less conciliatory than that found here. While ex- pressing admiration for his predecessors, Kaspi defends his right to differ with them and claims explicitly that "my deviating from their path is not an indication of my foolishness and deficiencies," unless someone can "prove the truth of our error" (Tirat Kesef, in Mishneh Kesef ed. Isaac Last [Pressburg, Alkalay, 1905], vol. 1, p. 6). Here Kaspi's tone is more defiant. I can also think of at least one other instance in which Kaspi pleads ignorance but is not telling the truth. In his commentary on Esther, he claims not to know the philosophical secrets contained in the story; but in fact he does. See my article, "Joseph ibn Kaspi on the Secret Meaning of the Scroll of Esther," Revue des études juives 160:3-* (2001): 379-408. 20 See Eisen, The Book of Job in Medieval Jewish Philosophy, pp. 45-8, 74^5.</page><page sequence="9">58 Robert Eisen JSQU tinction between the multitude of the sages and the Guide except that the sages do not attribute to the one who experiences providence conjunction with the Divine Intellect while the Guide does attribute it [to him] ....21 As Kaspi tells us here, Maimonides divides between his own view and that of the sages simply because they are different. Maimonides believes that providence is dependent upon conjunction with the "divine intel- lect," while the sages do not. What Kaspi is implying is that Maimo- nides' position on providence is based on philosophical understanding, while that of the rabbis is not.22 Thus, what seems to have escaped Kas- pi's comprehension of Maimonides in his long commentary on Job stands fully revealed here.23 Another piece of evidence which indicates that Kaspi is not as con- fused about Maimonides' theory of providence as he says, is a passage in Maskiyyot Kesef, the other more esoteric commentary on the Guide, in which Kaspi fully acknowledges that Maimonides has a secret position on providence and gives a description of it. There he informs us that according to this position, providence consists entirely in the develop- ment of the intellect which confers protection on us when it guides us in "the details of our affairs and events."24 Kaspi therefore understands Maimonides' position on providence as entirely naturalistic in that pro- vidence is synonymous with the exercise of the intellect for practical purposes and nothing more. Thus, there is no question that in his other 21 'Ammudey Kesef, ed. S. Werbluner (Frankfurt am Main: J. F. Baeck, 1848), rep- rinted in Sheloshah Kadmoney Mefarshey Ha-Moreh (Jerusalem: Ortsel, 1961), 11:17, p. 128. 'Ammudey Kesef is Kaspi's more exoteric of the two commentaries on the Guide. But as we argue below, it also contains esoteric elements. 22 This, however, only explains the distinction that Maimonides makes between himself and the rabbis. It does not explain the distinction that Maimonides makes between himself and the Torah, a problem equally bothersome to Kaspl. 23 One might attribute the shift in viewpoint between the long commentary on Job and 'Ammudey Kesef to the fact that the latter work was written at a later date. Support for an earlier dating of the commentary on Job may be found in the fact that it is mentioned in 'Ammudey Kesef while the reverse is not the case. However, as we noted earlier (n. 6), it is difficult to date Kaspi's works because he seems to have revised them throughout his career. Therefore, we cannot easily make a determination about the chronological order of Kaspi's views. It is also important to note that Kaspi seems to have been well aware of, and seems to have adopted Maimonides' esoteric method of discourse from the very beginning of his career. His very first work, Sefer Ha-Sod, later renamed Tirat Kesef is written in this style. It therefore seems unlikely that even if his long commentary on Job had been written earlier, Kaspi would have been insensitive to contradictions, inconsistencies, and other clues pointing to esoteric doctrines in Mai- monides' theory of providence. Therefore, it again seems probable that Kaspi's pro- blems with Maimonides are not genuine. 24 Maskiyyot Kesef éd. S. Werbluner (Frankfurt am Main: J. F. Baeck, 1848), rep- rinted in Sheloshah Kadmoney Mefarshey Ha-Moreh, 111:12, p. 98.</page><page sequence="10">(2006) Joseph Ihn Kaspi on the Book of Job 59 writings Kaspi assumes that there is an esoteric dimension in Maimo- nides' theory of providence and that the evidence for its existence are the very clues which Kaspi claims not to understand in the opening portion of his long commentary on Job. It would seem, therefore, that Kaspi's statements of confusion over Maimonides' theory of providence in his commentary on Job are de- signed both to conceal and reveal the true doctrine on providence which he shares with Maimonides. Those uninitiated in philosophy will take Kaspi's confusion over Maimonides' theory at face-value. The philoso- phically-trained reader, however, will understand that Kaspi, in pointing to difficulties in Maimonides' theory of providence, is alerting him to the existence of an esoteric doctrine and that it is one that Kaspi himself adopts. Our approach here helps make sense of other elements in Kaspi's discussion of Maimonides' views on providence. Take, for instance, a passage in which Kaspi focuses on Maimonides' criticism of the Geonic rabbis for adopting the views on providence of the Mutazilites.25 Kaspi expresses disbelief that Maimonides would be concerned about the rab- bis for adopting the views of non-Jews: So what of it for us or [for] them [i. e., those who follow the Mu'tazilites] if on this fundamental principle [i. e., providence] they have gone outside our religion? One could say this about all the other fundamental principles [of Judaism] - such as creation, prophecy, and other [doctrines]. For with every fundamental principle of our religion, we have people with contaminated views, and [we also have] very clever sages. There are those who go outside our religion, and "who abound in the customs of the aliens" (Is. 2:6). 26 Here we have an excellent example of Kaspi's capacity for mischief. It is hard to take Kaspi seriously in chastising those who rely on the "con- taminated views" of the Gentiles in formulating their philosophical views since he and Maimonides do the same throughout their philoso- phical writings! This statement therefore seems to be a flag to the astute reader that his criticisms of Maimonides are not genuine. Yet, Kaspi's discussion of Maimonides' theory of providence is not all obfuscation. At the end of that discussion, Kaspi appears to reveal some of his own thinking on providence. Summing up his thoughts on the preceding section, he says as follows: In general, it is the view of our Torah that a human being has the power of choice; divine providence [watches] over him as a species and as an in- dividual; and to the extent that he possesses an intellect, there is providence 25 Guide, 111:17, pp. 470-1. 20 LCJ, p. 136</page><page sequence="11">60 Rober t Eisen JSQ 13 [over him]. God, may He be blessed, will make judgments according to His way on each and every individual, for all His ways are justice. Maimonides, may he rest in peace, has explained this in chapters 17 and 51 of the third part [of the Guide]. This will suffice.27 Undoubtedly, Kaspi is giving us some insight into his own position here. However, one should note that he is not being terribly generous to his reader. He merely reiterates in general terms the Maimonidean position that providence is consequent upon the development of the intellect. Moreover, Kaspi casts his position in the traditional language of God making "judgments according to His way on each and every individual," language that is not harmony with the naturalism that comes through in other places in his writings.28 Thus, if Kaspi does adhere to an esoteric understanding of providence, he chooses not to reveal it to us here. Kaspi's discussion of Maimonides' views on providence is only a pro- padeutic to his treatment of the Book of Job in the rest of his commen- tary and it is to that portion of the text that we now turn. Kaspi begins his exposition on Job by taking up the question of whether the book is historically true or mere allegory. Kaspi acknowledges the opinion of Maimonides and some of the early rabbis who insist on an allegorical reading of Job, but he emphatically rejects that position: I am amazed at how both ancient and recent scholars, may their memory be blessed, could have doubted this [i. e., that Job existed]. For what differ- ence is there between it saying, "There was a man in the land of Uz" (Job 1:1) and it saying, "There was a man from Ramathaim of the Zuphites, in the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah" etc. (I Sam. 1:1), and that whole story about Eli and Samuel and the rest of them? Similarly, "In the days when the chieftains ruled" (Ruth 1:1). Similarly, "It happened in the days of Ahasuerus" (Esther 1:1). Similarly, there is written in the Torah, "This is the line of Noah" etc. (Gen. 6:9), "Noah begot three sons" etc. (Gen. 6:10), and everything about the flood and the story of the ark. If we say about the story of Job and his friends that a sage composed this as an allegory in order to instill in the heart of his readers opinions and convic- tions, one could say so for all of them [i. e., the stories in the Bible]. And if so, we would have no Torah, no Scripture, and [no] Writings. And if some of the ancient sages, may their memory be blessed, did not know his [i. e., Job's] time and place, what of it? Moreover, given that Job's case, as Maimonides tell us, is ubiquitous,29 as we also know - for there are many Jobs in the world at all times30... why is it not possible here that in the land of Uz there 27 Ibid., p. 137. 28 Such as his discussion of providence in Maskivvot Kesef referred to above, dd. 58-59. 29 Guide, 111:22, p. 486. 30 Lit. "there are many Jobs in the marketplace every year."</page><page sequence="12">(2006) Joseph Ihn Kaspi on the Book of Job 61 was this case concerning this [man named] Job? Thus, I believe that he existed as written.31 Kaspi uses a number of arguments to defend the view that Job is a historical figure. The first is based on the need to preserve the integrity of the biblical text. If one calls into question the existence of Job saying that the story is nothing but an allegory, one might as well call into question the truth of all biblical stories. Another line of reasoning ap- peals to common sense; Kaspi argues that the sorts of difficulties that Job experienced are not unusual and that there is therefore no reason to doubt his existence. However, a closer reading again reveals that Kaspi's position may not be as simple as it appears. Note that Kaspi's objection is not against those who interpret the story of Job allegorically but against those who treat it only as allegory - that is, as mere fiction. Kaspi leaves open the possibility that interpreting the story allegorically is fine so long as one recognizes that it is based in historical fact. In the continuation of the passage Kaspi hints at this very position with the following remarks: . . . but the gates of interpretation are not closed before us32 to interpret Ahasuerus as God who is 'at the head' and Haman as Satan. In such a manner we interpret that entire event. But Heaven forbid that we should [do so] with every biblical story; [we do this] only [with a passage] that comes from prophecies where necessity causes us to interpret it [as occurring] in a prophetic vision in that its [occurrence] while [one is] awake is impossible.33 Kaspi notes that even though Job existed, one can still interpret the biblical text as allegory. The example he uses here is the story of Esther in which Ahasuerus represents God, and Haman, Satan. Kaspi warns that we must use this technique sparingly; it should be employed only for places in the biblical text which are clearly prophetic visions and for which the literal reading is not plausible. I have shown elsewhere that Kaspi's suggestion of an allegorical read- ing for the Book of Esther is to be taken very seriously. Kaspi indeed reads that story as an allegory teaching deeper philosophical truths about the nature of prophetic predictions and historical processes. It is not that Kaspi ever doubts the historicity of the story of Esther; the story happened as written. It is just that its details were cast in a form designed to impart esoteric philosophical teachings. Certainly, Kaspi 31 LCJ, pp. 137-8. 32 Kaspi uses a variation on a similar statement made by Maimonides in Guide, 11:25, p. 327. 33 LCJ, p. 138.</page><page sequence="13">62 Roben Eisen JSQ 13 appears to restrict allegorical interpretation in the above-cited passage to biblical sources reporting prophetic visions, but this position seems to be part of Kaspi's strategy of obfuscation, for neither the Esther story nor the Book of Job are the product of such a vision.34 In short, Kaspi cites the example of the Book of Esther in order to hint to us that Job is indeed an allegory. Job, like Esther, may be based on historical occur- rence, but it has been written in a manner that is allegorical in that it conceals important philosophical truths. Kaspi's treatment of allegory here provides another example in which his expressions of disagreement with Maimonides disguise an affinity with him. In his opening discussion about providence, Kaspi feigned consternation and confusion over elements in Maimonides' theory of providence in order to signal the reader about the esoteric dimension of that theory and his support for it. Here, Kaspi does something similar by rejecting Maimonides' position that the Book of Job is to be read as allegory while providing clues that the latter position is, in fact, the one he supports. Why Kaspi conceals his views on this latter matter requires little ex- planation. Allegorical exegesis in general had become a controversial issue in the Jewish community by Kaspi's time, and therefore Kaspi seems to have been eager not to indulge openly in this form of interpre- tation.35 Thus, Kaspi prefers to declare his belief in the historicity of Job, while leaving it up it to a philosophically-trained reader to recog- nize that this position by no means precludes a deeper allegorical read- ing.36 The next question that Kaspi takes up is Job's national identity. Kaspi affirms that Job and friends are all non-Jews: 34 Eisen, "Joseph ibn Kaspi on the Secret Meaning of the Scroll of Esther." 35 The dynamics of allegorical exegesis and its controversial position in medieval Judaism is dealt with in Frank Talmage, "Apples of Gold: The Inner Meaning of Sacred Texts in Medieval Judaism," Jewish Spirituality, ed. Arthur Green (New York: Crossroad, 1988), vol. 1, pp. 313-356; Joseph Sarachek, Faith and Reason: The Conflict over the Rationalism of Maimonides (Williamsport: Bayard Press, 1935). ib Our conclusions suggest that Kaspi may have had a more positive view on alle- gory throughout his life than is generally assumed by scholars. Cf. Kasher's view that allegory is treated negatively in Kaspi's early works ("Joseph ibn Kaspi as Philosophi- cal Exegete," pp. 19-27). This point is discussed by me in my article, "Joseph ibn Kaspi on the Secret Meaning of the Scroll of Esther," pp. 407-8. Kaspi's desire to conceal his affinities with allegorical exegesis can also be detected in his two commentaries on Proverbs. In one of his commentaries on Proverbs he denies that Proverbs has allego- rical meaning, while in the other he claims that it can be interpreted allegorically ÇAsarah Keley Kesef, vol. 1, pp. 8, 83). Yet, even in the commentary in which he denies allegory, Kaspi drops hints that he endorses it (ibid., Kaspi's remarks on Prov. 25:11, p. 116).</page><page sequence="14">(2006) Joseph Ihn Raspi on the Book of Job 63 Even though Job and his friends were not Jews, it was correct for one of the ancient scribes of the sages of our religion to compose this story as it occurred in his time or somewhat prior to him; for it is an exalted story and is of equal value to all nations and religions, and cases of its kind, Maimo- nides tells us, are found ubiquitously among the Jews and the other na- tions.37 And who knows? Perhaps Job and his friends were all, or in part, Jews who were exiled for some reason to the land of Uz, as Elimelech was exiled to Moab.38 To conclude, why should we [indulge] in these pointless investigations? The truth is equal for all nations. And if Job was an Ara- mean, one should not question how God could have spoken to him, for He did indeed speak with Balaam the wicked one. One should also not question how, if Job and his friends were not Jews, the Book [of Job] was included with the other Scriptures. For I have told you that this [i. e., the message of Job] is of equal value to all nations. There is also the Book of Jonah that is a story entirely about another nation. In the Torah is also written the story of the generation of the flood, and the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. In sum, all the stories and events of our nation and the other nations were written by the ancient scribes in order to bequeath to the coming [generations] true opinions and convictions [regardless] of whom they occurred to. This will suffice.39 What is striking about this passage is its apologetic tone. Kaspi works hard to justify the value of the Book of Job in light of the fact that it is about non- Jews. He argues that regardless of the provenance of its characters, it is "an exalted story" that is "of equal value to all nations and religions." He also notes that a number of other stories in the Bible are about non- Jews. The apologetic tone is especially evident when Kaspi briefly enter- tains the unsubstantiated theory that Job and his friends may have indeed been Jews who were exiled "for some reason" to the land of Uz. Yet, Kaspi's tone here fits very well with the esoteric style of his commentary as we have understood it up to this point. In this instance, Kaspi seems to be trying to appease the traditional reader who may be troubled about Job's non- Jewish origins.40 In the next portion of his commentary, Kaspi deals with the figures of Satan and the divine beings who appear before God in the opening chapters of Job. Much of Kaspi's discussion of these celestial figures is centered on a number of difficulties he has with Maimonides. All of 37 Guide, 111:22, p. 486. 38 Ruth 1:2. 39LCJ, p. 138. 40 I use the term "traditional reader" here and elsewhere in this paper in reference to the reader who is the target of Maimonidean esotericism in general and Kaspi's eso- tericism in particular. That is, such a reader represents the vast majority of Jews - the masses - who are uninitiated in philosophy, are unprepared for philosophical truths, and therefore require that those truths be concealed from them.</page><page sequence="15">64 Robert Eisen JSQ 13 them revolve around Kaspi's belief that Maimonides has read too much into the biblical text and has imposed philosophical meaning on insig- nificant details. We cannot examine the interpretations in Maimonides to which Kaspi objects; Maimonides' statements on Satan and the di- vine beings are highly ambiguous and invite a number of different read- ings.41 It is sufficient for us to note that Maimonides finds philosophical meaning in the fact that the biblical text singles out Satan for special mention when the divine beings present themselves before God.42 Mai- monides also attributes philosophical significance to the fact that only with the second appearance of the divine beings before God does the biblical text specify that Satan came "to present himself before the Lord" along with the divine beings.43 Kaspi finds nothing of philosophi- cal import in any of these details.44 Kaspi goes on to argue that one has to understand the descriptions of Satan and the divine beings in Job according to the well-known rabbinic dictum: "the Torah speaks in the language of human beings." This tal- mudic statement, which was given philosophical significance by medie- val Jewish philosophers and became a staple of their discourse, is uti- lized by Kaspi in a number of ways throughout his writings.45 Here it takes on the meaning first enunciated by Maimonides that the Torah will often depict difficult metaphysical conceptions in terms understand- able to those ignorant in philosophical matters. Thus, Kaspi argues, in this case the biblical text depicts God as being surrounded by divine beings just as a king is normally surrounded by his servants, and all the details in the biblical text pertaining to these images are no more than embellishments of this one basic principle. Maimonides is therefore mistaken in investing them with philosophical meaning. 41 Avraham Nuriel deals with Maimonides' conception of Satan in "Towards a Clarification of the Concept of Satan in the Guide of the Perplexed" (in Hebrew), Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 5 (1986): 83-91. I also deal with this issue in The Book of Job in Medieval Jewish Philosophy, dd. 48-55. 42 Job 1:6, 2:1. Guide, 111:22, p. 487. 43 Job 2:1. Guide, 111:22, p. 488. 44 LCJ, pp. 139-40. 45 The intent of the original talmudic dictum is that not all extra words or phrases in the biblical text have halakhic significance but sometimes serve rhetorical purposes (B. T Yevamot 71a, Bava Metsia 31b). Medieval Jewish philosophers reinterpreted the principle in a philosophical vein. Maimonides' view, which Kaspi adopts here and becomes normative for medieval Jewish philosophers, is that the Torah speaks the language of human beings in the sense that the Torah couches its descriptions of God in anthropomorphic terms so that God's attributes will be intelligible to the masses {Guide, 1:26, p. 56). This, however, is not the only meaning that Kaspi imparts to this principle. See Kasher, "Joseph ibn Kaspi," pp. 136-44; Herring, pp. 57-63; Isaiah Dimant, pp. 16-21.</page><page sequence="16">(2006) Joseph Ihn Kaspi on the Book of Job 65 However, one has to read carefully to realize that Kaspi strikes a far more sympathetic note regarding Maimonides' views on Satan and the divine beings when he concludes his thoughts on these figures as follows: All [the passages dealing with Satan and the divine beings] are [stated] in accordance with their dictum: the Torah speaks in the language of human beings. [This is so] even if the servants of God have levels [of importance] next to Him in accordance with [their] closeness and distance, as is the case with kings of flesh and blood. Just as it is possible that Doeg the Edomite was one of the more distant ones in the circle before Saul, so is it correct that this was the case for Satan before God, even though all the men [in Saul's company] were part of the group stationed to stand next to Saul, and all the angels were stationed to stand next to God. Therefore, Maimo- nides did very well in interpreting the response of Satan to God - that is, his statement "I have been roaming all over the earth" (Job 1:7, 2:2).46 Kaspi explains that just as a king may have servants whose ranks are determined by their physical distance or closeness to the king, the bib- lical text depicts God's relationship with the divine beings in a similar manner in order to specify their ranking in the celestial hierarchy. For this reason, Kaspi approves of Maimonides' interpretation of the bibli- cal text which describes Satan as "roaming the earth." It is not entirely clear what Kaspi is telling us here. The major pro- blem is that Kaspi's insights hang on his understanding of Maimonides' interpretation of Satan as a being who is depicted as "roaming the earth," and he does not tell us what that understanding is. In his exposi- tion on Job, Maimonides states that Satan's roaming the earth means that "there is no relationship whatever between him and the upper world, in which there is no road for him."47 The interpretation of Mai- monides' reading here depends on how one construes his view of Satan, and as Avraham Nuriel has shown, there is much disagreement among medieval and modern commentators on this issue; most interpreters believes that for Maimonides Satan represents either matter, privation, or chance events.48 Since Kaspi never specifies which of these interpreta- tions of Satan he believes Maimonides supports, it is difficult for us to determine precisely how he reads Maimonides' specific statement about Satan roaming the earth.49 46LCJ, pp. 139-40. 47 Guide, 111:22, p. 487. 48 This is NurieFs insight in his article, "Towards a Clarification of the Concept of Satan in the Guide of the Perplexed." 4y My own preference, mentioned earlier, is that for Maimonides Satan represents privation. Still, we cannot be sure what Kaspi's opinion was on this matter.</page><page sequence="17">66 Roben Eisen JSQ 13 Nonetheless, Kaspi says just enough here for us to glean important information. First, by approving of Maimonides' interpretation of Satan "roaming the earth," Kaspi, at the very least, is signaling us that he accepts Maimonides' basic premise that Satan is an allegorical represen- tation for some sort of malevolent natural force that has no relationship with natural forces that are more benevolent. Commentators are unan- imous in understanding Maimonides' remark about Satan roaming the earth in this manner even if they disagree about the precise identity of the force that Satan represents, and it is unlikely that Kaspi would de- part from them on this point.50 Our interpretation of Kaspi here also explains his observation that the ranking of the divine beings in God's celestial court is reflected metaphorically in their closeness or distance from Him. Satan roams the earth at some distance from God because the natural force he represents is of low rank compared to that of other natural forces represented by the divine beings. Thus, once again Kaspi presents a critique of Maimonides that masks his affinity with him. He objects to Maimonides' views on Satan and the divine beings, but in his final remark on these figures - one that can easily slip our attention - he hints that the matter is not so simple. Here Kaspi voices approval of Maimonides' interpretation of the de- scription of Satan as a being who roams the earth and he thus indicates that he largely accepts Maimonides' understanding of this figure as a malevolent natural force of some kind. Yet, as with his discussion of Maimonides' theory of providence, Kaspi hints at an esoteric doctrine but provides little information about its content. If he accepts Maimo- nides' conception of Satan as a malevolent natural force, he refuses to identify which force he has in mind. Nor does Kaspi give us any insight into the philosophical significance of the divine beings whom Satan ac- companies. The largest portion of Kaspi's commentary deals with the dialogue between Job and his friends, which is no surprise given that this discus- sion constitutes the largest section in the Book of Job as a whole. Kaspi begins his discussion of the dialogue by once again rejecting Maimo- nides' views. According to Maimonides, each of the participants in the dialogue represents a different school in philosophy or theology and therefore a different approach toward providence. Job represents Aris- totle; Eliphaz, the Torah; Bildad, the Mu'tazilites; Zophar, the Ashear- ites; and Elihu represents Maimonides' own view.51 Kaspi voices a num- 50 See Eisen, The Book of Job in Medieval Jewish Philosophy, pp. 50-5. 51 Guide, 111:23, pp. 490-5.</page><page sequence="18">(2006) Joseph Ihn Kaspi on the Book of Job 67 ber of objections to this reading. The first one is perhaps the most im- portant and revealing statement in the entire commentary: First, I will say that the opinion of Aristotle and the opinion of our Torah, as written in the book of the Torah and the prophets and as ex- plained by Maimonides in these three chapters [i.e., Guide 17, 23, and 5 1],52 is one opinion. I do not believe that Aristotle is outside our religion on this fundamental principle - [i. e.,] the intention of our religion as ex- plained by Maimonides and proven by him with biblical verses. Examine his book which is the truth and beyond which there is nothing [to be said]. Thus, I am amazed at the Honored One [i. e., Maimonides] as to why, with respect to this fundamental principle, he would see Aristotle as being outside our religion. I do not find this in his [i. e., Aristotle's] words. Moreover, how could Aristotle be outside our religion? Our religion in this matter goes according to the rational syllogism.53 Kaspi's criticism of Maimonides here is similar to earlier ones in which he objects to the divisions which Maimonides makes between viewpoints on providence, but Kaspi's thinking here takes a highly provocative turn. He is now disturbed by the fact that Maimonides divides between the view of the Torah and his own view, on the one hand, and that of Aris- totle, on the other; according to Kaspi, these views should all be one and the same. Kaspi thus provides critical insight into his esoteric views on providence. It is Aristotle who, he believes, provides the true position on providence.54 Note also the mischievous manner in which Kaspi presents his view here. His esoteric position is couched in the same expressions of confusion over Maimonides' teachings that we saw earlier as if he does not understand what Maimonides is saying. But, in fact, not only does he understands full well what Maimonides is saying, he is actually in- forming us about his own radical views on providence.55 Yet, despite Kaspi's revelation, we see once again that he is stingy when it comes to details regarding philosophical matters. We now know that the Torah, Aristotle, and Maimonides all share the same view of providence, but we are not told what Aristotle's views of provi- dence consist of, nor how that view is identical with that of the Torah or Maimonides. There is much about Kaspi's understanding of providence that therefore remains unclear. 52 These chapters are mentioned in the previous paragraph. 53 LCJ, p. 141. 54 Cf. 'Ammudey Kesef, 111:18, p. 128, where Kaspi states that the views of Maimo- nides, the Torah, Plato, and Aristotle are all one and the same. 53 This passage also proves that Kaspi could not have been serious when earlier in his discussion he vilified those who accept the "contaminated views of non- Jewish philosophers" (above, p. 57). Quite clearly, that is precisely what he is doing here.</page><page sequence="19">68 Roben Eisen JSQ 13 Kaspi's second objection to Maimonides' reading of the dialogue in Job is that he is inconsistent. Maimonides begins his account of the dialogue between Job and his friends by stating that the three who in- itiate the dialogue - Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar - are in agreement that there is divine justice in this world, that it manifests itself in the well- being of the righteous and the suffering of the wicked, and that it is for this reason that Job has suffered. However, Kaspi claims, Maimonides contradicts himself when subsequently he demonstrates that each of the participants in the dialogue represents a different school of thought. Kaspi points out that neither the Mu'tazilite view attributed to Bildad nor the Ash'arite view attributed to Zophar supports the doctrine of just compensation in this world which according to Maimonides is the posi- tion agreed upon by all of Job's three friends.56 Kaspi has certainly proven once again to be an astute reader of Mai- monides. Indeed, there is no doubt about the inconsistency which he sees here. But if one looks at the discussion upon which Kaspi is com- menting, what is clear is that for Maimonides the initial interpretation of the position of Job's friends represents only a superficial exoteric read- ing, while the second provides the true philosophical reading. After in- troducing the first interpretation, Maimonides transitions to the second in the following statement which Kaspi himself cites: You will find this notion [i. e., of divine justice in this world] repeated in the discourse of Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, all three being agreed on this opinion. This, however, is not the purpose of this story as a whole; for this purpose is rather to show the peculiarity of each of them and to make known each one's opinion concerning this story: namely, that the greatest and heaviest misfortunes befall the most perfect individual, who was the most unblemished of them in righteousness.57 Maimonides is saying quite openly that the first reading which sees Job's friends as united around the common belief in divine justice in this world is not "the purpose of the story." The true meaning of the dialo- gue emerges only when one understands that each participant represents a different school of thought. It is unlikely that Kaspi has simply missed the point here given his thorough familiarity with Maimonides' Guide. It is more probable that Kaspi is doing what he has done on previous occasions in his commen- tary. He points to a clue in Maimonides that suggests an esoteric doc- 56 Guide, 111:17, pp. 466-8; LCJ, p. 143. 57 Guide, 111:23, p. 491; LCJ, p. 142.</page><page sequence="20">(2006) Joseph Ihn Kaspi on the Book of Job 69 trine, claims not to understand it, but is in reality alerting the philoso- phically astute reader to the existence of that doctrine. Kaspi's third objection against Maimonides' reading of the dialogue in Job exhibits a similar pattern. Kaspi claims that Maimonides justifies his reading of the dialogue in Job by being highly selective with the verses he cites. Kaspi adduces a series of verses for each participant that Maimonides ignores and are inconsistent with views he attributes to them. Kaspi also shows how the verses that Maimonides cites to support his reading do not necessarily support Maimonides' reading.58 Here too there is a probability that Kaspi is dissimulating. Maimo- nides explains quite explicitly that not all the statements of the partici- pants are of importance to the philosophical meaning of the discussion. Maimonides warns his reader "not to pay attention to other dicta ren- dered necessary by the order of the discourse, as I explained to you at the beginning of the Treatise."59 Maimonides is alluding here to the introductory chapter in the Guide in which he explains that some para- bles in Scripture contain superfluous elements meant to hide their eso- teric meaning.60 According to Maimonides, many of the verses in the dialogue in Job are in this category. Again, as a thinker familiar with every line of Maimonides' Guide, Kaspi should have been aware of this passage, and thus it would seem that once again he feigns ignorance of Maimonides' esoteric strategy. Kaspi's own view regarding the dialogue between Job and his three friends is that it contains only two positions: that of Job and that of the three friends. Job believes that there is no divine justice in this world. He bases this judgment on the conviction that the highest perfection that a person can attain is moral perfection and that there is no perfection in the realm of the intellect since human beings are incapable of theoretical wisdom. Since Job knows that he has achieved moral perfection and has still suffered, he therefore concludes that there is no divine justice in this world. Job's three friends take the precise opposite view: there is divine justice in this world, and Job's suffering must therefore be due to past sins.61 What is striking is that Kaspi settles on a reading of the dialogue that is identical to Maimonides' exoteric interpretation of that discussion noted above, and it is unlikely that this congruence is accidental. By adopting what appears to be an exoteric reading of the dialogue, Kaspi 58 LCJ, pp. 143^. 59 Guide, 111:22, p. 490. 60 Guide, ^Introduction, p. 12. 61 LCJ, pp. 143-50.</page><page sequence="21">70 Roben Eisen JSQ 13 is signaling us that the interpretation offered in his commentary does not tell the whole story and that there is a deeper layer of understanding here. Let us now turn to the final portion of Kaspi's commentary which deals with the addresses of Elihu and God. According to Kaspi, the correct view in the dialogue that explains Job's suffering is provided by Elihu. When Elihu enters the dialogue, he first expresses anger at Job for accusing God of injustice, but he is even angrier at Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. According to Kaspi there are two reasons for Eli- hu's harsh judgments against Job's friends. First, they have falsely ac- cused Job of being a sinner and have therefore assumed incorrectly that his suffering is due to divine punishment. While Elihu is unhappy with Job's blasphemous remarks against God, he emphatically upholds Job's conviction that prior to his ordeal he was indeed a person of moral perfection.62 Second, and more important, Elihu chastises Job's friends for their failure to respond to Job's claim that human beings are not only incapable of achieving intellectual perfection, they have no access to theoretical knowledge whatsoever. Kaspi delineates how Job's friends should have responded to him in the following key passage: True, Job; you have achieved the limit of wisdom and understanding which is called "fear of God" and "shunning evil."63 But you have not reached or cognized the other type of wisdom and understanding, which is to do good - that is, the observance of the commandments of the heart which are the primary [commandments]. That is, [one must] know by way of truth that there is a First Existent Being and that He is one and is not a body and all the other matters that are connected to this which have been commanded in our holy Torah and are the starting-point of our command- ments. There is no doubt that a person is not a completely righteous indivi- dual until he observes all 613 commandments, not just some of them. There- fore, Job did not have a perfect intellectual soul; all the more so [did he not have a perfect] prophetic soul which is the endpoint of human perfection. The final endpoint of [perfection in] human beings is the perfection of Moses our teacher, may he rest in peace, for he was a blameless and upright man, fearing God and shunning evil, the master64 of Torah, the master of wisdom, the master of prophecy. All the sages and prophets were beneath him [in stature], and varied in greater or lesser [degrees of wisdom and prophecy]. One should explore all this in chapters 17, 23, and 51 of the third part of the Guide [of the Perplexed] for it is the truth beyond which there is nothing [to be said] .... 62 Ibid., pp. 149-50. 63 Job 1:2, 3:2. Kaspi takes the phrases to refer to Job's moral perfection. 64 Lit. "the father of."</page><page sequence="22">(2006) Joseph Ihn Kaspi on the Book of Job 71 Therefore Elihu became angry with them [i. e., Job's friends], whose defi- ciencies were equivalent to his 65 Job's friends should have told him that according to the Torah, humans have access to theoretical knowledge, intellectual perfection is indeed possible, and that one achieves that perfection by observing "the com- mandments of the heart" which prod us to study philosophical matters. Moreover, the Torah teaches that there are gradations of intellectual perfection. At the highest level of intellectual perfection is the prophet, and the greatest of the prophets is Moses. Therefore, Job is not as right- eous as he himself believes, for in denying even the possibility of intel- lectual perfection he has not observed "the commandments of the heart" and has failed to obey all of God's precepts. In Kaspi' reading of Elihu's actual address to Job, the implications of these ideas are drawn out with respect to Job's suffering: [Elihu says:] "Why do you complain against Him / That He does not reply to any of man's charges? / For God speaks in one [manner]"66 etc. (Job 33:13-5). He means, God speaks only in one [manner] with human beings, and that is [on] the level of prophecy - as he says "in a dream" (Job 33:15) .... It was as if he said to Job: You are not a prophet which is the final perfection of the human species. Therefore, [go ahead and] be angry at the affliction of your body; your ire will be of no benefit to you. If you had been at the endpoint of human perfection and favored by God like Elijah, Elisha, and Isaiah, for example - God would have saved you from these afflictions; and if they had come [upon you], God would have been your healer. For even those who reach the gates of death and "come close to destruction"67 (Job 33:22) - if "he has an angel,68 one advocate" before God (Job 32:23), he will rescue him from being destroyed. This will happen to a person "two" or "three times" (Job 33:29), that is to say, many times - though in the end, all human beings die ,...69 In this passage, Kaspi explicates Job 33:14-30, a cryptic section of Eli- hu's address in which he tells Job that God speaks to human beings "in a dream" (v. 1 5) in order to spare them from destruction; that there is an "angel" who "has mercy" (v. 23-24) on them to aid in their rescue; and that God "does all this" two or three times (v. 29-30). Kaspi interprets Elihu to be saying that God exercises providence over human beings 65 LCJ, p. 150. 66 I translate the biblical text here according to Kaspi's understanding. 67 The NJPS translation renders shahat here as "Pit." I replace it with "destruction" to better capture Kaspi's understanding of the term. 68 The NJPS version translates mal'akh as "representative." I translate it here as "angel" because it is likely that Kaspi would have understood it this way. 6y LCJ, p. 151.</page><page sequence="23">72 Robert Eisen JSQ 13 who have achieved prophecy. If Job had perfected his intellect and be- come a prophet, an angel would have come along to rescue him from his afflictions or he would not have been afflicted in the first place. Kaspi's exposition of God's address to Job in the final chapters of the story is excessively brief and is contained in the following remarks: God informed him [i. e., Job] how he was deficient in wisdom, and that he was very far from [the level of] prophecy. When Job recognized his deficien- cies in opposition to his [initially] imagining himself as [being] at the end- point of perfection like Moses our teacher, or the rest of the prophets ... he said, "See, I am of small worth" etc. (Job 40:5). He also said, "Of things beyond me ... I did not know" etc. (Job 42:3), "But now I see with my eyes" etc. (Job 42:5).70 According to Kaspi's reading, God reiterates Elihu's claim to Job that he is neither a wise man nor prophet, a statement that causes Job to recognize his deficiencies. At the end of his commentary, Kaspi summarizes the lessons that emerge in the final chapters of the Book of Job by identifying four gradations of providence according to one's level of perfection. In as- cending order we have the tarn, or the blameless individual, a reference to figures such as Job who have moral but not intellectual perfection;71 the sage, who has intellectual perfection; the prophet; and finally Moses who is the most perfect of all individuals.72 Kaspi appends another sec- tion to his commentary which provides exegesis of selected phrases and passages throughout the Book of Job. However, it offers no additional information about Kaspi's philosophical understanding of the story.73 Kaspi's commentary on the final chapters of Job seems to conceal more than it reveals. We are told that providence is tied to intellectual perfection, that the highest level of intellectual perfection results in pro- phecy, and that Job suffered because he lacked that perfection. However, there is a good deal of information missing here. There is no discussion of the actual mechanism of providence. Thus, we do not know how precisely prophecy might have helped Job. We also do not know what any of this has to do with the position of Aristotle or Maimonides both of whom Kaspi had credited with holding the correct view on provi- dence as we saw earlier. Neither Aristotle nor Maimonides are men- tioned here. 70LCJ, p. 151. 71 In the opening verse of the Book of Job, Job is referred to as tarn or "blameless," a description that both Maimonides and Kaspi take as a reference to moral perfection. See Guide, 111:22, p. 487. 72 LCJ, p. 152. 73 Ibid., pp. 153-9.</page><page sequence="24">(2006) Joseph Ibn Kaspi on the Book of Job 73 Kaspi's exposition of the biblical text is also wanting. One suspects that Kaspi follows Maimonides in focusing on Elihu's remarks in Job 33 as revealing the central message of the book since Maimonides had done the same. Moreover, Kaspi shows interest in the same elements of that chapter that had engaged Maimonides' attention: Elihu's mention of dreams as well as his allusion to the angel which saves an individual from harm two or three times.74 However, what Maimonides says about these clues is notoriously cryptic and Kaspi's exegesis is too general for us to have a firm idea about how he makes sense of the biblical text here. For instance, Kaspi gives us no insight as to how to construe the critical figure of the angel. Especially disappointing is Kaspi's exposition of God's address to Job. From Kaspi's brief remarks, it would seem that God adds nothing to what has already been said by Elihu. Thus, when we come to the section of Kaspi's commentary that should be the climax of his exposition, Kaspi's presentation turns out to be surprisingly sparse. Kaspi's tendency to conceal rather than reveal here is also evident in his language. He invokes terminology that is distinctively traditional in character as if speaking to an audience unacquainted with philosophical ideas. Kaspi characterizes Job's lack of philosophical wisdom as a fail- ure to observe "the commandments of the heart" and claims that this is a serious oversight on Job's part because "a person is not a completely righteous individual until he observes all 613 commandments, not just some of them." This is a rather odd message for a figure who Kaspi had argued earlier is not even a Jew! There may also be significance in Kaspi's choice of the phrase "com- mandments of the heart." As Kasher notes, when Kaspi refers to com- mandments of the heart, he is clearly alluding to Maimonides' notion of intellectual commandments which require one to strive for intellectual perfection and knowledge of God by becoming versed in natural science and metaphysics. However, the precise phrase "commandments of the heart" in fact comes out of Ibn Ezra's lexicon and refers to a much broader array of imperatives than those included in Maimonides' intel- lectual commandments. This phrase subsumes not only the requirement to know God, but a series of ethical commandments - such as the re- quirement to refrain from coveting one's neighbors wife.75 That Kaspi insists on using Ibn Ezra's terminology in place of that of Maimonides follows from what we have said. Ibn Ezra's terminology provides the 74 Guide, 111:23, pp. 494-5. Eisen, The Book of Job in Medieval Jewish Philosophy, pp. 56-71. 75 Kasher, "Joseph ibn Kaspi's Aristotelian Interpretation," pp. 119-20.</page><page sequence="25">74 Roben Eisen JSQ 13 perfect vehicle for Kaspi to express the superiority of intellectual perfec- tion over moral perfection without offending the traditional reader be- cause it deflects attention away from the Maimonidean orientation of his thinking. In substituting intellectual commandments with command- ments of the heart, Kaspi has replaced a purely Aristotelian category with one that is more pietistic. The same tendency to appeal to the traditional reader is evident in Kaspi's exposition of Job 33. According to Kaspi, Elihu informs Job that "if you had been at the endpoint of human perfection and favored by God like Elijah, Elisha, and Isaiah, for example - God would have saved you from these afflictions."76 Here Kaspi interjects the names of biblical prophets that are nowhere mentioned in the biblical text upon which he is commenting. Moreover, in the same passage Kaspi sees the need to explain why Elihu does not mention Mosaic prophecy. Kaspi informs us that this lacuna is because "Elihu spoke only of the regular occurrence [of prophecy], and therefore did not mention the unique type [of prophecy] of Moses."77 Again, all of this seems strange given that, according to Kaspi, none of the characters in Job are Jewish. It is not hard to figure out what Kaspi is doing here. Kaspi renders Elihu's ideas in non-philosophical terms as part of his overall strategy to conceal his true philosophical views and appease the traditional reader. The need to conceal is most pressing at this point of his commentary, for it is here that we come to the portion of the book which in Kaspi's thinking contains its central philosophical message. Let us pause here to draw some conclusions about Kaspi's long com- mentary before moving on to the second commentary. Kaspi's long commentary exhibits a consistent pattern of concealment. Throughout the work, we saw a number of instances in which Kaspi's criticisms of Maimonides are clearly meant to mask his agreement with him. In some instances, Kaspi himself clues us in to his affinity with Maimonides. Thus, in his discussion of Satan, Kaspi spends most of his energy object- ing to Maimonides' understanding of that figure, and one can easily miss the fact that toward the end of his exposition he actually approves of a key element in Maimonides' reading that undermines his objections. At other times, Kaspi leaves it up to the reader to discern his affinity with Maimonides. Thus, in his discussion of Maimonides' theory of providence at the beginning of the commentary, Kaspi expresses confu- sion over anomalies in Maimonides' presentation of his theory of pro- 76LCJ, p. 151. 77 Ibid.</page><page sequence="26">(2006) Joseph Ihn Kaspi on the Book of Job 75 vidence so that the astute reader will figure out that those anomalies point to the esoteric meaning of that theory. We have also seen instances in which Kaspi conceals his true views by couching philosophical ideas in traditional, non-philosophical, Jewish terminology. This was most evident in Kaspi's explication of Elihu's position where Job's shortcom- ings are understood as a failure to observe the commandments of the heart. The difficulty is that Kaspi gives us precious little information to help us discern the esoteric doctrines that he attempts to conceal. With re- spect to providence, Kaspi at one point of the commentary reveals to us that he considers Aristotle's position to be correct; however, he gives us no indication how he understands Aristotle. Kaspi adopts the position that providence is consequent upon intellectual perfection; however, he provides no clues regarding the precise mechanism of providence. We are in a similar position with respect to Kaspi's actual reading of Job. It is likely that Kaspi follows Maimonides in construing the figure of Satan as a malevolent natural force, but he gives us no indication as to whether that force is matter, privation, or chance. Kaspi locates the central message of Job in the address of Elihu in Job 33 and indicates that it concerns the notion that providence is tied to intellectual perfec- tion. Yet, critical elements in this chapter go unexplained, such as the angel who rescues afflicted individuals from their suffering. Kaspi merely summarizes the biblical text without providing much philosophi- cal insight. Let us now turn to Kaspi's short commentary on the Book of Job. Kaspi opens this work with an acknowledgement of the earlier commen- tary. He notes that his first commentary contained an extensive critique of Maimonides' interpretation of Job despite his great admiration for him, and that it proposed an alternative reading.78 Kaspi then explains why he felt the need to compose a second commentary. The Book of Job is of such importance, Kaspi tells us, that the ideas of the earlier com- mentary are worthy of review. Kaspi also indicates that the new com- mentary will contain some fresh ideas, for "it is impossible for me not to 78 SCJ, p. 160. I disagree with Kasher's assessment that in the second commentary Kaspi has a more much reverent attitude toward Maimonides than in the first (Kasher, "Joseph ibn Kaspi's Aristotelian Interpretation," p. 121). It seems that the same rever- ent attitude exists in the first commentary, though it is expressed in a different way. As we have seen, Kaspi starts off that commentary by apologizing for criticizing his pre- decessors and by explaining that his criticisms emanate from his own deficiencies. Therefore, in the first commentary, Kaspi emphasizes his own deficiencies, while in the second he emphasizes Maimonides' greatness. Both statements, however, are equally reverent of Maimonides.</page><page sequence="27">76 Roben Eisen JSQ 13 expatiate upon my interpretations and add some things."79 True to his intentions, Kaspi's commentary can be divided into two parts. The first one is a summary of his first commentary on Job.80 In the second part, Kaspi expands on a number of points.81 We need not look at portions of the second commentary that reiterate ideas found in the first. What will be of interest to us are those places where the second differs from the earlier work. There are, in fact, a number of instances of this sort, none of which are acknowledged by Kaspl. Perhaps the key difference between the two works is that the second commentary tends to present a more exoteric, traditional understanding of the Book of Job than the first one does. Kaspi's philosophical views are therefore even more concealed here than they were in the first com- mentary. This is evident in Kaspi's depiction of the figure of Job and the process of transformation that he undergoes. Kaspi suggests that as the story begins Job observes not only the commandments of action, but also the commandments of the heart "by way of tradition."82 That is, Job adheres to the precepts mandating correct belief, but only as one who accepts those beliefs as commanded, not as one who truly under- stands them from a philosophical standpoint. This description departs markedly from the first commentary where Kaspi's position was that Job's lack of philosophical wisdom entirely precluded his ability to ob- serve the commandments of the heart and no allowance was made for adhering to such commandments by tradition alone. The revised image of Job is presented most clearly in the following passage: It is evident that one who observes all the commandments of action - even though with this [observance] he knows the [commandments of the] heart by way of tradition - is at a level not equal to the level of one who observes all the commandments of action and with this [observance] knows the [commandments of the] heart according to knowledge by way of truth - that is, by demonstrative proof - even if the former are of very great stature and are servants of God, as we will soon mention. Whoever achieves the second level, his level is not equal to the level of one who reaches the pro- phecy of the prophets. Whoever reaches the level of the prophet, his level is 79 SCJ, p. 160. 80 Ibid., pp. 160-70 81 Ibid., pp. 170-9. As Kasher notes, the structure here is similar to that of the first commentary except that the final section of the long commentary, which contains a series of minor exegetical points, is not recounted in the second commentary (Kasher, "Joseph ibn Kaspi's Aristotelian Interpretation," pp. 118-9). 82 SCJ, p. 168.</page><page sequence="28">(2006) Joseph Ihn Kaspi on the Book of Job 11 not of the degree of one who reaches the [level of] the prophecy of Moses .... Therefore Job reached the [level of] human perfection with respect to the commandments of action, and perhaps also in knowing the [commandments of the] heart by way of tradition. Thus, he is described as "blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil" (Job 1 :2) and [he is described] as a righteous man . . . ,83 There are four gradations here: those who keep the commandments of action and belief but observe the latter only through tradition, those who observe the same commandment but understand the command- ments of belief through demonstrative proof, those who reach the level of prophecy, and finally the degree of Moses. Job, at the beginning of the story, is at the first level. Kaspi goes on to explain that Job experienced suffering because he had not graduated to the higher levels of perfection which bring with them greater providence.84 The revised depiction of Job is clearly meant to be more appealing to a traditional audience than that found in the first commentary. In the first commentary Kaspi implies that those individuals like Job who are ignorant in philosophy cannot observe the commandments of the heart in principle and are therefore unable to be fully compliant with God's laws. With the depiction of Job in the second commentary, Kaspi's per- spective on those uninitiated in philosophical wisdom is not nearly as harsh. He now tells us that they too can observe the commandments of the heart in some measure if they adhere to them by way of tradition.85 Connected to these observations is another discrepancy between the two commentaries regarding the question of who is worthy of provi- dence. In the second commentary Kaspi informs us that people who obey the commandments of the heart only by tradition experience pro- vidence, even if it is in diminished form compared to those who have 83 SCJ, p. 171. 84 Ibid., p. 172. 85 With a careful reading, one notes that Kaspi is not unequivocal in his more positive depiction of Job in the second commentary. In the passages in which Kaspi declares that Job observed the commandments of the heart by way of tradition, he repeatedly qualifies his assertions about Job with the word "perhaps" (ulay); thus, "perhaps in addition he observed the commandments of the heart by way of tradition" (SCJ, p. 171; my italics); "Job reached the [level of] human perfection with respect to the commandments of action, and perhaps also in knowing the [commandments of the] heart by way of tradition" (SCJ, p. 172; my italics). Kaspi appears to be alerting us that he has not really changed his position from the first commentary and that his more positive assessment of Job is nothing more than an appeal to the traditional reader. It is also interesting to note that Kaspi employs the same "perhaps" in his long commentary in his brief flirtation with the notion that Job and his friends were Jews. We said that this statement was also probably meant to appease the traditional reader and did not represent Kaspi's own view (above, p. 14).</page><page sequence="29">78 Roben Eisen JSQU philosophical learning. At one juncture, Kaspi goes one step further by arguing that even those who adhere only to some of the commandments of action are rewarded in proportion to what they observe: It is true that those at the first level [i. e., those who observe all the com- mandments by way of tradition] will receive a good reward in accordance with what [commandments] they observed and did, even if they only ob- served one or two commandments of action. Their reward will be to escape from afflictions in this world in some measure and for a period of time in accordance with their level [of observance]. For God does not deprive any creature of reward in this world, all the more so in the world to come.86 This is a far more generous position than that found in the first commen- tary. There providence was limited only to those with a high degree of intellectual perfection, while here it is conferred upon those who do not even have philosophical learning. Thus, it is evident once again that the second commentary is meant to appeal to a more traditional audience.87 The tendency of the second commentary to appeal to a more tradi- tional reader is also reflected in its portrayal of Job in the final chapters of the story. According to the new reading, God addresses Job in order to impart exalted philosophical secrets (sodot ha-metsiut) and Job achieves the status of prophet.88 This depiction of Job is significantly different from that of the first commentary where God did not impart philosophical wisdom to Job nor did Job achieve prophecy. There God merely reiterated Elihu's position that Job was intellectually deficient and that prophecy was a capacity well out of his reach. Thus, while in the first commentary little hope was held out to those ignorant in phi- losophy to experience prophecy, here that hope is very much concretized in the figure of Job. It is also telling that in the second commentary Kaspi has much less to say than in the first regarding the actual information imparted to Job by both God and Elihu. As we noted, the first commentary was itself quite reticent in its explication of this portion of the book. However, Kaspi at least engaged philosophical issues in abbreviated form. In the second commentary there is practically no discussion whatsoever of phi- losophical matters in the exegesis of the addresses of Elihu and God - even though, as we have just noted, the "secrets of existence" are relayed to Job according to this version.89 The discrepancy makes sense in light 86 SCJ, p. 174. 87 These last observations are substantially the same as those mentioned by Kasher, "Joseph ibn Kaspi's Aristotelian Interpretation," pp. 121-3. 88 SCJ, p. 173. 89 SCJ, pp. 168-9.</page><page sequence="30">(2006) Joseph lbn Kaspi on the Book of Job 79 of our analysis; it is to be expected that in his more traditional presenta- tion of Job, Kaspi would be more reluctant to impart sensitive philoso- phical information. That Kaspi's second commentary is more traditional in character than the first comes out in a number of other ways. Take, for instance, his references to Aristotle. Early in the commentary Kaspi refers in passing to "Aristotle, the despicable one."90 Such harsh language regard- ing Aristotle is nowhere to be found in the first commentary and is clearly meant to appeal to the opponents of philosophy. Later on in the commentary Kaspi signals a more positive attitude toward Aristotle when, after summing up the key points of his interpretation of Job, he says as follows: In my opinion, Aristotle the wise one would acknowledge all of this. So why should we impute guilt to him and ostracize him if he wants to enter into the religion of Moses?91 With this remark, Kaspi's attitude toward Aristotle is not as negative. Yet, Kaspi never exhibits the wholesale embrace of Aristotle that we find in the first commentary where he unabashedly identifies Aristotle's views on providence with those of the Torah. Moreover, Kaspi seems to be parrying the objections of the traditional reader by pleading for the acceptance of Aristotle as one who "wants to enter the religion of Moses."92 Kaspi's desire to appeal to a traditional reader in the second com- mentary is also evident in a statement that he makes toward the end of the work. In commenting on the reconstitution of Job's vast wealth in the closing verses of the story, Kaspi surmises that this occurred all in one day because God "opened up his good treasure-house and brought down upon him thousands of gold coins" so that he would be able to buy all the items he had lost. Kaspi is most probably speaking to a traditional reader here. Not only is there no mention of such a miracle in the biblical text, an event of this sort is not even possible in Kaspi's thinking given his thorough-going naturalism.93 90 Ibid., p. 162. 91 Ibid., p. 174. 92 A similar point is made by Kasher ("Joseph ibn Kaspi's Aristotelian Interpreta- tion," p. 121). See also SCJ, pp. 174-5, where Kaspi appeals to the traditional reader by praising a long list of rabbis as every bit the equal of philosophers such as Aristotle, Euclid, and Theophrastus in achieving various degrees of perfection. Here too the highly traditional bent of Kaspi's second commentary is evident. 93 SCJ, p. 177. Seen. 2 above.</page><page sequence="31">80 Robert Eisen JSQU Our analysis here also helps us make sense of an enigmatic feature of Kaspi's reading of Job. We saw that in the first commentary Kaspi places Moses in a class by himself as someone who achieves the greatest perfection and is therefore worthy of the highest form of providence. Such statements might not attract attention were it not for the fact that in the second commentary Kaspi's interest in Moses seems inordi- nate. The commentary is punctuated by a number of statements about Moses that are lengthy and extreme in their praise of him. It is not unusual for medieval Jewish thinkers to praise Moses in the highest of terms. However, Kaspi's interest in Moses here can only strike one as being somewhat out of place, given that Moses is not a topic of discus- sion in the Book of Job. The following passage is typical: ... he [i. e., Moses], may he rest in peace, observed the entire Torah from the Mighty One, and fulfilled all of His commandments to the utmost of perfection - I mean to say, first by tradition and then by philosophical proofs and then by perfect and pure prophecy. He did not pass up a good deed that he did not perform. All the more so did he not commit a trans- gression or sin. And even though he committed one at the waters of Mer- ibah,94 as he testifies against himself - he received his punishment in this world as explained in the Torah. In general, Moses reached human perfec- tion so that he was no longer by definition human and became an angel. Therefore, no evil could come upon him because he was under the wings of God who protects, selah. He would not stir from his place;95 who could approach him to harm him?96 It is clear from the beginning of this book that God gave Satan the destroyer permission only to [harm] those dwelling on earth; yet, Moses ascended to heaven and dwelled in the celestial realm.97 Here Moses is depicted as the only figure to escape all forms of physical evil because he had in effect become detached from the human and material realm and had achieved angelic status. What explains Kaspi's focus on Moses here? One suspects that it is part of his program of concealment. That suggestion is in fact argued by Isaiah Dimant who claims that Kaspi's statements about Moses in both commentaries on Job are not to be taken seriously. Kaspi's true opinion is that Moses, while certainly being the greatest of the prophets, none- theless had faults and committed sins as the Bible tells us, and he was therefore subject to the perils of this world as any other individual is. Dimant points out that this view is in fact expressed explicitly in a num- ber of other places in Kaspi's writings. Kaspi's inordinate praise of 94 Num. 20:1-13. 95 A play on Is. 46:7, or a possible reference to Ex. 33:11. 96 Perhaps an allusion to Ex. 34:29-35. 97 SCJ, p. 176. For other references to Moses, see also pp. 172, 173, 174.</page><page sequence="32">(2006) Joseph Ibn Raspi on the Book of Job 81 Moses in the two commentaries on Job is therefore only for the con- sumption of the masses.98 Dimant's hypothesis finds support in the fact that the praise of Moses in the second, more exoteric commentary is far more extreme than it is in the first." Thus far, we have shown that the second commentary differs from the first in being a more exoteric and traditional work. Yet, there is perhaps one instance in which the second commentary points to esoteric doc- trines not referred to in the first, and that is with respect to the subject of immortality. In the first commentary, Kaspi seems to reject any sug- gestion that the Book of Job is concerned with immortality. This comes through in a passage in which Kaspi takes issue with Maimonides' inter- pretation of God's admonition to Satan that he do as he wishes to Job so long as he is sure to "spare his life (nafsho)."100 Maimonides con- strues the term nafsho here as "his soul," specifically that part of the soul that endures in the afterlife, an apparent reference to the acquired intellect.101 Kaspi takes Maimonides to mean that God is warning Satan 98 Dimant, pp. 127-35. See especially Tirat Ha-Kesef, p. 150, for a passage in which Kaspi strongly hints at Moses's fallibility and that his providence was not perfect. Dimant also makes the argument that Kaspi's vacillation on his views about Moses are in part an anti-Christian polemic. It is not clear, however, how this hypothesis fits with his assessment of Kaspi's statements on Moses in the two commentaries on Job. 99 It also explains a glaring inconsistency in the passages just cited. Kaspi notes that Moses sinned at the waters of Meribah, and he does so right after telling us that Moses was perfect in all his deeds and was incapable of sin! Kaspi quickly brushes off the problem by maintaining that Moses was punished for his sin in this world rather than the next. Yet, this answer hardly addresses the difficulty. We still do not know how an angelic being such as Moses could sin in the first place. Kaspi therefore appears to be hinting to us that Moses was a fallible human being like the rest of us. - Kasher has an entirely different understanding of Kaspi's view of Moses in the two commentaries on Job ("Joseph ibn Kaspi's Aristotelian Interpretation," pp. 120, 121, 123^4). She argues that in the first commentary Kaspi forwards an esoteric view that only Moses experi- enced complete providence, while in the second commentary Kaspi offers an exoteric view in which providence is available to those below the level of Moses. There are a number of problems with this reading. First, Kaspi clearly discusses gradations of providence below Moses even in the first commentary (LCJ, pp. 150, 151, 152-3; above, p. 23). Second, Kasher fails to take into account the statements which Dimant cites from Kaspi's other works which describe a far less exalted picture of Moses. Yet, inter- estingly, in her dissertation Kasher cites evidence that Kaspi sees Maimonides' exalta- tion of Moses beyond all other prophets as politically motivated, a position close to the one we are suggesting ("Joseph ibn Kaspi," p. 88). Mesch also has a discussion of Kaspi's views regarding the unique status of Mosaic prophecy (pp. 67-79), but does not engage the contradictions on that issue that are noted by Dimant. 100 Job 2:6. 101 Guide, 111:22, p. 488. Cf. Guide, 1:41, p. 91, where Maimonides discusses the term nefesh. Maimonides tells us that the latter is an equivocal term, and that according to one of its meanings "it is a term denoting the thing that remains of man after death."</page><page sequence="33">82 Robert Eisen JSQ 13 not to incite Job to blaspheme so that he loses his chance for immortal- ity.102 Kaspi has two objections to Maimonides' reading. First, Kaspi ar- gues that it is in fact Satan's job to prod people to sin so that they lose their capacity for immortality and only a person with a properly developed intellect is able to stop Satan from accomplishing his pur- pose.103 Even more important for our purposes is Kaspi's second objec- tion in which he complains that the issue of immortality is of no sig- nificance to Job's situation: What reason is there for this [idea] in this place? Job is still alive, he still has the capacity to choose between good and evil, and everything depends on the outcome.104 Kaspi's point is not entirely clear. He seems to be saying that since Job is still very much alive and has the choice to live out the rest of his life as a righteous individual, the issue of immortality is not at all relevant here. Kaspi goes on to provide an alternative reading of God's warning to Satan by suggesting that God is simply informing Satan that while he may cause Job to suffer, he must spare his life. The term nafsho refers to Job's body and soul considered as one entity.105 Thus, Kaspi seems to eschew any engagement with the issue of im- mortality here. In the second commentary, the issue of immortality is addressed more directly. In his interpretation of the final verse of the book which states that Job dies, Kaspi says as follows: The author [of this commentary] says: How is it that I have never seen a story about a person in Scripture [who experienced] good things and success that did not come to a bitter conclusion106 with [the statement] "and he died?"107 Kaspi goes on to list many of the heroes of the Bible all of whom met the same fate - including the Patriarchs, Joseph, Joshua, even Moses. Kaspi continues by lamenting, "Woe unto us! We have no good in the end, just to die old and in advanced years and in ripe old age. Woe to us for that good!" But Kaspi finishes the thought on a more positive note. "Yet our hope is for the true good which comes to the soul after separa- tion from the body." The concluding blessing brings together these thoughts. Kaspi prays in the name of the collective "we" for physical 102 LCJ, p. 140. 103 Ibid. 104 Ibid. 105 Ibid. 106 A play on II Sam. 2:26. 107 SCJ, p. 179.</page><page sequence="34">(2006) Joseph Ihn Kaspi on the Book of Job 83 well-being, wealth, and honor both for "us" and "our children." He also prays that we merit the good which follows "in the world-to-come."108 Kaspi does not give over much information here about immortality from a philosophical standpoint here. In fact, the language he uses is quite traditional, which suites the character of the commentary as a whole. Yet, it is still highly significant that Kaspi draws attention to the subject of immortality here. By making this issue literally his last word on the Book of Job, Kaspi seems to be hinting that this is indeed where true providence is to be found. That he does not say more about it is quite understandable. Philosophical interpretations of immortality had become a source of great controversy in the Jewish community since Maimonides, and it is likely the reason that Kaspi alludes to it only in the briefest manner.109 Kaspi's two commentaries on Job have proven to be highly difficult works to penetrate. They are a maze of clues, innuendos, and ambiguities which point to esoteric doctrines regarding providence in general and the Book of Job in particular. Yet, in the final analysis they reveal relatively little about Kaspi's views about either. Kaspi consistently hints that he is in agreement with Maimonides' theory of providence and his reading of Job despite statements to the contrary, but he says little about how he actually understood his predecessor. In his most revealing statement, Kaspi indicates in one passage in his long commentary that the true posi- tion on providence is that of Aristotle and that it has something to do with intellectual perfection and prophecy, but we have no idea from what Kas- pi says what his views are regarding the actual mechanism of providence. There are several possibilities as to why Kaspi would reveal so little. With respect to providence, Kaspi may have believed that his true eso- teric position had already been adequately delineated in his two com- mentaries on the Guide and that he therefore would be revealing too much by speaking about it in his commentaries on Job as well. As we noted, it is in those works that Kaspi tells us a good deal about Maimo- nides' esoteric position on providence and he admits that this philoso- phical understanding of providence is at variance with that of the rabbis. That position is naturalistic and consists in the notion that it is the 108 Ibid. 109 It is noteworthy how little Kaspi has to say about immortality anywhere in his writings. I can recall no extensive discussion of this issue in any of his works, an ob- servation reflected in the fact that none of the scholars of Kaspi have written about this issue. This may indicate a discomfort on Kaspi's part with this topic in light of the Maimonidean controversy which focused a great deal on the question of immortality.</page><page sequence="35">84 Robert Eisen JSQ 13 practical intellect which is responsible for guiding one's well-being. An- other possibility is that Kaspi believed that the true esoteric meaning of providence was already well-known among the circles of Jewish philo- sophers in his own period who would have been familiar with the Guide and its inner meaning, and that he therefore believed that he did not need to say much about it. The same reasoning could also explain why he reveals so little about the Book of Job. Here too he may have assumed that there was a common understanding of the book's true philosophical meaning in elite circles among his contemporaries. We may also consider the possibility that Kaspi's commentaries on Job were written simply as an exercise in esotericism. Kaspi may have had no desire to reveal his true views on Job, but intended rather to revel in the art of concealment. As noted earlier, Kaspi is a colorful personality and has great capacity for mischief and playfulness. The Job commentaries may therefore be the best expression of those very traits. We can also speculate about why Kaspi wrote two commentaries on Job rather than one. Kasher believes that each of these works is directed at a different audience. The first commentary is an "Aristotelian" reading that is wholly esoteric and is addressed to the elite. The second commen- tary is a "fundamentalist" reading that is exoteric and is meant for the masses. There is certainly merit in Kasher's suggestion. It is quite possible that the commentaries were addressed to different audiences. However, our analysis indicates that Kasher may have somewhat overdrawn the distinction between the two works. Certainly, the first commentary is more esoteric than the second, but we have shown that the former work also contains exoteric elements and that it conceals as much as it reveals. Conversely, the second commentary is undoubtedly more exoteric than the first, but it contains clues to esoteric doctrines as well. Still, Kasher's basic approach must be taken seriously. The two commentaries may have indeed been written with two different audiences in mind. Kasher also suggests that Kaspi may have composed the second com- mentary because he felt that the first commentary revealed too much of his esoteric teachings and that it might arouse hostility from his tradi- tional contemporaries.110 Kasher claims that she has no evidence for this theory and that it is purely speculative. Yet, support for Kasher's posi- tion may be found in the second commentary where Kaspi, in fact, alludes to the hostility which the masses have towards the philosophers. In one passage, he advises that those who observe the commandments of the heart by way of tradition should not "denigrate" those who observe 110 Kasher, "Joseph ibn Kaspi's Aristotelian Interpretation," p. 124.</page><page sequence="36">(2006) Joseph Ihn Kaspi on the Book of Job 85 them through philosophical understanding since the second group ad- heres to the very same commandments as the first, just with a deeper understanding.111 This statement may be a hint that in composing the second commentary Kaspi was motivated by concerns about provoking the ire of his traditional readers. Further insight into Kaspi's desire to compose two commentaries on Job rather than one may also be gleaned by considering the other occa- sions that he produces two commentaries on the same text. For example, Kaspi writes two commentaries on the Guide} 12 the Torah,113 and the Book of Proverbs,114 and it would be instructive to examine the relation- ships in these pairs of commentaries alongside the relationship between two commentaries on Job. A thorough examination of this sort would require separate study, but we can learn a good deal by briefly looking at least one of the three pairs of commentaries just mentioned: the two commentaries on the Guide. In his introduction to these works, Kaspi tells us that one commentary, "Ammudey Kesef, is exoteric in character, while the other, Maskiyyot Kesef is esoteric.115 Yet, when one examines these works, one quickly realizes that the distinction between the two commen- taries is not absolute. We have a number of instances in which Kaspi reveals esoteric truths in his more exoteric commentary while expressing exoteric views in his esoteric commentary. For instance, in the exoteric commentary Kaspi reveals his esoteric views on free will and provi- dence.116 In the esoteric commentary, Kaspi offers what are clearly exo- teric positions on the infallibility of prophecy and creation before offering his esoteric views on these issues.117 Therefore, these commentaries are not wholly exoteric or esoteric, but commentaries in which both genres are mixed, with one commentary being more esoteric than the other. It would seem that a similar scheme is evident in the two commen- taries on Job. As we have seen, both commentaries contain esoteric and exoteric elements, but one commentary is more esoteric than the other. Kaspi's desire to compose two commentaries on Job may therefore be part of a larger pattern in his writing in which dual commentaries mix esoteric and exoteric elements in varying degrees.118 111 SCJ, p. 176. 112 'Ammudey Kesef and Maskiyyot Kesef referred to earlier. 1 • 3 Tirat Ha-Kesef and Matsref La-Kesef referred to earlier. 114 'Asarah Keley Kesef, vol. 1, pp. 7-132. 115 Introduction to 'Ammudey Kesef and Maskiyyot Kesef, p. 1. 116 'Ammudey Kesef, introduction, p. 7; 111:18, p. 128. 117 Maskiyyot Kesef, 11:8, pp. 93-4; 11:13, pp. 99-100. 118 Whether the same can be said for the other pairs of commentaries cannot be discussed in detail here. However, I will note some preliminary observations. A similar</page><page sequence="37">86 Roben Eisen JSQ 13 There is one other possible explanation for the fact that Kaspi com- posed a second commentary on Job, and that is that it was meant to impart information not found in the first. At the beginning of the sec- ond commentary, Kaspi hints that this is the case when he suggests that it is impossible for him to review what was written in the earlier com- mentary without adding some new information. Moreover, the most significant addition in the second commentary is Kaspi's reference to immortality. While the first commentary does not deal with this ques- tion, the second one finishes with a suggestive allusion to it. Is it this issue which motivated Kaspi to compose a second commentary? Per- haps. Kaspi may have been troubled by the fact that the first commen- tary has little discussion of immortality. The second commentary may have therefore been written to ensure that his readers understand that true providence is immortality. relationship seems to hold between Kaspi's two commentaries on Proverbs. The first commentary in the printed editions claims that Proverbs has both an exoteric reading according to the plain meaning of the text and an allegorical one dealing with esoteric truths. The second commentary reads Proverbs only according to its plain sense and claims that the book contains no allegorical meaning. Yet, there are indications that in the second commentary Kaspi endorses allegorical interpretation (n. 36 above). Thus, here again we have what appear to be esoteric and exoteric commentaries., though it is unclear whether Kaspi mixes the genres with the same subtlety that we find in his commentaries on Job and the Guide. We are handicapped by the fact that the commen- taries on Proverbs are difficult to read because the printed editions were poorly edited. As for the two Torah commentaries - Tirai Ha- Kesef and Matsref La-Kesef '- it is even more difficult to make determinations as to their relationship. These commentaries are different from the other pairs in being longer, more complex, and quite different from each other in style and structure. Yet, a detailed study of these commentaries should yield valuable insights about their relationship.</page></plain_text>
