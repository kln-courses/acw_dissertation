<plain_text><page sequence="1">750389 Passive and Active Restraint Systems-Performance and Benefit/Cost Comparison L. M. Patrick Wayne State University EXPENDITURES FOR AUTOMOTIVE SAFETY have been soaring since the early 1960s with a gross increase in the slope of the expenditure-time curve since the passage of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966. The primary goal of the added expenditure is to reduce injuries and fatalities with, hopefully, an overall economic gain through re- duced cost associate with the decreased injuries and fatalities. A brief review of the pertinent statistical data on deaths and injuries will be presented, followed by an analysis of the effec- tiveness of different restraint systems in mitigating injury and death with the benefit/cost figures based upon the effective- ness analysis. Since performance of the various systems and the costs associated with injuries and fatalities are estimates, simplified models will be used for clarity. The vehicle popula- tion will be assumed a constant 100 million with 10 million vehicles added and removed from the population annually. Inflation will not be considered, since it is an unknown and should affect all systems about the same. These simplifications will permit easy comprehension of the major points with no gross error introduced in the relative merits of the different systems. BASIC STATISTICS UTILIZED According to the National Safety Council (NSC) (1),* there were 33,500 deaths in passenger cars in 1973. With an insig- *Numbers in parentheses indicate References at end of paper. nificant number of airbag equipped cars and an estimated lap- shoulder harness usage rate of only 3-5%, the 33,500 annual death rate will be the basis for comparison. This neglects any reduction in injury and fatalities by present airbag and/or har- ness systems which is assumed to be inconsequential due to the small usage factor. It should be pointed out that the num- ber of deaths has been increasing annually, but recent safety improvements, reduced speed, improved highways, and efforts to reduce alcohol related accidents should tend to level off the annual death rate. These factors have already reduced the an- nual death rate based upon miles driven. NSC reports two million nonfatal injuries in vehicle acci- dents with fewer than 1 .9 million vehicle occupant injuries. To be conservative and to attribute the maximum benefit to the restraint systems, the 1 .9 million figure will be rounded at two million representing all injuries including pedestrians, cyclists, and other injuries associated with motor vehicle accidents. NSC (1) attributes a cost of $20.2 billion to 1973 motor vehicle accidents including wage loss, medical expense, insur- ance administration and claim settlement and property dam- age. This amount includes the cost of all accidents including pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, truck occupants, and property damage. The cost attributable to occupant injuries and fatalities will be taken as the total cost less the property damage cost. This results in a total cost assigned to injuries and fatalities of $13.9 billion. ABSTRACT - - Five different restraint systems- mandatory harness, airbag + 20% lap belt usage, airbag, passive three point harness, and torso and knee bar- are analyzed for fatality and injury reduc- tion, benefit/cost ratio, and cost-effectiveness. The mandatory harness is superior to the others in all comparisons with ap- proximately 100,000 lives saved over the first 10 years which is about twice as many as would be saved by the other systems. A major advantage of the mandatory harness is that practically all of the vehicles are equipped while the other systems will re- quire 10 years for complete installation. 1032</page><page sequence="2">It should be noted that $6.6 billion of the loss is attributed to wage loss, $1.7 billion to medical expense, and $5.6 billion to insurance administration and claims settlement costs. The wage loss includes ". . . . present value of future earnings lost by those totally incapacitated or killed." While this is a com- mon method of measuring societal losses, it is not completely realistic in that the loss is not total to the gross national product since much of the future earnings of the deceased is earned by other workers. Only that part that must be replaced by society without receipt of productivity is a true loss. The NSC does not differentiate the loss between injuries and fatalities in Accident Facts (1). Therefore, the same ratio of costs of aalities and injuries will be used as is utilized in the NHTSA-TSC report (2) which is 34: 1 . On this basis, and using the 33,500 fatalities and two million injuries as a base, the cost per fatality is about $156,000 and the cost per injury is $4600. ANNUAL DEATH RATE SINCE 1933 The annual death rate based on number of deaths per year and number of deaths per 1 00 million vehicle miles is graphed in Fig. 1. These data are taken from Accident Facts, 1974 Edi- tion (1) from 1973 statistics. The number of deaths has in- creased from 31,363 in 1933 to 55,800 in 1973. This includes all of the deaths and not just the vehicle occupant deaths. The death rate per 1 00 million vehicle miles has decreased from 15.6 in 1933 to 4.3 in 1973. The data are shown with a point to point plot in Fig. 1 and the best fit exponential curve for the death rate per 100 million vehicle miles and with the best fit second order polynomial curve for the annual death rate. The exponential curve fit for the death rate/ 100 million vehicle miles of Fig. 1 is predicated on the 1933-1960 period. It will be observed that the declining death rate up to 1960 in- creased from 1962-1966 after which it started down again. The increase in the death rate over this period of time is prob- ably due to better reporting and/or to higher speeds. The in- creased emphasis on automotive safety starting in the early 1960s led to better reporting and recording methods. Many police departments started recording their statistics on com- puters at that time, which provides a more accurate record and better retrieval capability. The energy shortage of 1973-1974 and the nationwide re- duction in maximum speed limit to 55 mph has had a marked effect on the number of fatalities. Whether the reduction in fatalities has been due to reduced velocity and consequently a lower energy level in high speed collisions, or whether it is due to the decreased driving is unknown at this time. Furthermore, whether the decrease in fatalities and the improvement in the rate of fatalities per 100 million miles will continue appears to be questionable, since the reduction in death has decreased over the dramatic improvement early in the energy crisis. Part of the improvement in fatality rate in 1973 can be attributed to the energy crisis, but the decrease follows the trend of de- creasing fatality rate of 1933-1960 and since 1966. It is too early to establish the effect of the energy shortage and/or de- creased speed limit on the injury and fatality statistics. Referring to Fig. 1 , the extrapolated fatality rate based on the 1933-1960 data would be three deaths/100 million miles in 1973. Comparing the 4.3 deaths/ 100 million miles cur- rently experienced with the three deaths/ 100 million miles from extrapolating the curve indicates that the performance has not been improved but has actually deteriorated. Part of this is probably due to the difference in reporting, resulting in the upswing in the fatalities reported from 1960-1966. The fact that the curve has decreased with about the same slope as the extrapolated curve is further evidence that there was a change in the reporting but no change in the rate of change of fatality rate as a function of time. The increased number of miles of interstate highways has benefitted the safety record. The estimated number of lives saved due to the miles driven on the freeways in 1973 is 4100 (1). The freeways and the safety devices incorporated in the mid 1960s, such as the energy ab- sorbing steering column and improved interior design, account for the decrease in fatality rate since 1966. It is interesting to note that in the early 1970s, the NHTSA had for its stated goal the reduction of the absolute number of deaths by half by the mid 1980s. The administrator at that time indicated that he was confident the goal would be met. By the end of 1974 it became obvious that the number of deaths could not be decreased so dramatically, so the emphasis Fig. 1 - Annual death rate since 1933 in terms of total deaths and deaths per 100 million miles 1033</page><page sequence="3">1034 L.M.PATRICK was changed from absolute numbers back to fatality rate. It appears that the large expenditures by the government in establishing standards and by industry in meeting them have not improved the death rate over that which is predicted from extrapolating the pre-1960 data. The decrease in death rate since 1966 is about the same as would be expected without any standards being introduced. RESTRAINT SYSTEMS TO BE COMPARED While there are many systems that have been proposed for restraining occupants, the ones that are far enough developed to be considered are those shown in Table 1 as the three point mandatory harness and the air bag plus 20% lap belt use in the active category, with the passive category including the airbag, the three point harness, and the torso belt and knee bar combi- nation. Other systems such as the proposed net, the Grimes restraint (3), the cushioned interior, and the air belt have not been developed to the point where they will be included in this study. The air belt in either the active or passive mode is an extension of the three point harness and will tend to in- crease the effectiveness in reducing fatalities and injuries due to better distribution of the load over the body and reduction of concentrated forces. Each of the five systems listed in Table 1 will be discussed with justification for the overall effectiveness and estimated cost. EFFECTIVENESS OF MANDATORY THREE POINT HARNESS- Of the five systems Usted in Table 1 , only the three point harness has sufficient field use to permit an accu- rate estimate of its effectiveness. The other systems must rely on laboratory evaluation to establish their performance. Bohlin (4) reports the largest data bank of accident cases in which occupants were wearing a three point harness and notes an overall effectiveness of 48-63% in injury mitigation. His studies show protection up to 60 mph at the fatal level. Glen (5) reported on human volunteer runs under ideal con- ditions with the three point harness at velocities up to 30 mph barrier equivalent velocity (BEV) with no injury and some of the volunteers wilUng to go higher. It should be noted that the voluntary level is weU below the level at which injury occurs. Consequently, the 30 mph is a conservative value weU below the injury tolerance level.

(6), found no fatalities at collision severities up to 53 mph barrier equivalent velocity and substantial reduc- tion in injury for frontal force collisions from field data on the Volvo automobile in Sweden. Approximately 30% of the oc- cupants had a maximum AIS-2 injury (7) at 30 mph BEV as compared to a cumulative injury rate in forward force colli- sions of 66% at 30 mph in the "Passive Protection at 50 mph" paper (8), which is a 55% lower injury rate. Henderson (9) indicates a 25% reduction in fatalities in New South Wales, Australia, with the introduction of the man- datory seat belt law. Further, he lists all of the fatalities within 250 miles of Sydney with each vehicle rated according to a Seating Position Deformation Index (SPDI). The SPDI is a measure of the encroachment on the occupant volume in the vehicle. It is listed as a fraction of the original total. For ex- ample, if the volume occupied by an individual is decreased by 25% the SPDI is 0.75. In the study of fatal accidents, he found that 73% had 0.5 SPDI or less. Fifty percent had less than 0.2 SPDI. With the small amount of occupant space available in most of the fatal cases that he reports, there is little likelihood that the three point harness or any other system would be ef- fective in eliminating fatalities. The Australian vehicles are less crashworthy than those manufactured in the United States. They represent a large range of vehicle sizes with the majority in the smaller category. The United States vehicles are less prone to roll over. Also, there is less intrusion in the United States vehicles. When the mandatory Australian law went into effect, there was no effec- tive standard for the harnesses. Thus, many of the harnesses are substandard compared to United States harnesses. Finally, the Australian highways are not as well designed as are the United States highways. This results in more side impact and off road accidents in Australia than in the United States. With these favorable conditions for the United States car popula- tion, the field data should show at least a 35% reduction in- stead of the 25% reported from New South Wales. Nelson (10,1 1) reported on 160 cases in the USA of which 60% of the vehicles had heavy damage of the type often associ- ated with occupant injury. However, 99% of the lap-shoulder belt users had no injury or only minor injury. Many of the vehicles were grossly deformed indicating a severe collision. There were two fatalities in the first report (10) and four in the next report (11) which were unusual cases with the fatal injuries resulting from direct impact of the occupant with objects entering their vehicle. Utilizing the technique of "Analysis of Effects of Proposed Changes to Passenger Car Requirements of NVFSS 208" (2) results in the following analysis. The frontal force protection against fatalities is at least 40 mph with the three point harness based upon the 60 mph of Bohlin 's paper (4), the 30 mph BEV non injury volunteer data from Glenn (5), the study by Patrick, et al. (6), and Henderson's (9) report on the fatal stud- ies in New South Wales. The 40 mph frontal force protection represents a 75% reduction in the fatal collisions for frontal force impacts. Side impact protection results in 30% reduc- tion and the roll over a 50% reduction in deaths.</page><page sequence="4">PASSIVE AND ACTIVE RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 1 035 Applying these percentages to the fraction of fatalities in accidents in different directions shows: 1. Frontal force- 75% reduction 0.75 X 0.44 = 33% 2. Side force-30% reduction 0.3 X 0.24 = 7% 3. Rollover- reduction 0.5 X0.14= 7% Total 47% With a conservative estimate of 80% use of the harness under mandatory condition as compared to the 85% found in Aus- tralia, the overall reduction in fatalities is 0.8 X 47 = 37.6%. A conservative figure of 30% effectiveness in reducing fatalities will be used hereafter. This is based upon a field experience of 25% in Australia and higher effectiveness reported by Bohlin in Sweden and the analysis following the NHTSA technique at 47%. The 30% is deliberately understated to insure that the results, if the mandatory law is passed, will be equal to or bet- ter than anticipated. Reduction in injuries will be based upon the Swedish experience in which 48-63% of the injuries were eliminated in Bohlin's report (4), the 55% of Patrick, et al. (6), and the higher value of Nelson (10). A conservative figure of 55% will be utilized for the injury reduction. These data are listed in Table 1 . The cost for the mandatory three point harness system is based upon the data from NHTSA (2) which provides an inter- lock belt system cost of $98.50 with $32 attributed to the sequential interlock for front seat positions. The $32 has been eliminated as the interlock is no longer necessary and the re- sulting estimated cost is $66. EFFECTIVENESS OF AIRBAG + 20% LAP BELT USE- The airbag and lap belt are considered to be an active system with the understanding that the airbag is passive and is listed under the passive section in Table 1 . The effectiveness of the airbag is derived in the next section. Only the additional pro- tection afforded by the 20% use of the lap belt will be incorpo- rated here. The 20% lap belt use is predicated on the present use of approximately 30%, with the decrease in use to 20% based on what is known about the learning curve in human ac- tivity which indicates that the lap belt will be used less as the passive protection of the airbag is stressed. When the airbag was introduced as a passive system by NHTSA it was stated that the belt system would not be required. With the emphasis on a passive system the 20% belt use is probably optimistic. The overall effectiveness of the airbag alone is assigned a value of 25% for fatalities and 28% for injuries. The lap belt protection in addition to the airbag will be assumed to be 80% as effective in reducing the fatalities and injuries. Thus, with the assumed 25% airbag fatality effectiveness and the 20% belt use calculated as 80% of the airbag effectiveness, the increase from the airbag is 0.25 X 0.2 X 0.8 = 4% for the lap belt or 25 + 4 = 29% for the airbag and 20% lap belt use. Similarly, the effectiveness for injuries for the airbag plus the 20% lap belt use is 30%. These figs, are shown in Table 1 . The cost for the airbag plus 20% lap belt use is $185, which is the same as the airbag alone since the lap belts will apparently be required with the airbag even though it is considered to be a passive system. EFFECTIVENESS OF PASSIVE AIRBAG SYSTEM-The passive airbag system considered consists of airbag protection for all front seat occupants. Also included in the system are lap belts for all occupants. However, when considering the air- bag as a passive system, it is assumed that the lap belt is not used by those passengers protected by the airbag and the effect of the rear seat passengers with or without lap belts is negli- gible. When considering frontal force collisions, the usual direc- tion is from about 10-2 on a clock scale. When these angles are considered, the airbag is effective only in the "frontal force" collision direction. It will not be assigned any protec- tion in the side collision which includes the angles 2-4 o'clock and 8-10 o'clock. For these angles, the airbag will have essen- tially no effect on protecting the occupants. Similarly, the protection afforded by the airbag in rollover is small and will be assumed to be negligible. For the frontal force collisions of 10-2 o'clock, 35 mph protection will be assumed. Using the NHTSA (2) technique results in a protection factor of 0.57 for the frontal force colli- sions. With the 0.44 factor for frontal force collisions, the ef- fectiveness of the airbag is 0.57 X 0.44 or 25%. Using the same logic and NHTSA data, the airbag will pro- tect against 30 mph injury level which represents 64% of the injured occupants in frontal force collisions. The effectiveness is 0.64 X 0.44 or 28%. The effectiveness of 25% for fatalities and 28% for injuries for the airbag is shown in Table 1 . It should be stressed that the data are based upon the labo- ratory studies with essentially no field accidents to corraborate it. At the time of this writing, the author was able to find 35 accidents involving airbag cars of a severity which resulted in airbag inflation. In the 35 airbag accidents there were two fatalities or about one in 18 collisions of severity BEV 12 mph or greater which is the severity required to inflate the airbag. Statistically, the sample is insignificant and no firm conclu- sions can be drawn from it. However, in the general accident population of 12 mph or greater, the fatality rate based upon 33,500 occupant fatalities is about one in 300 assuming 60% of the 16,600,000 accidents (1) are of 12 mph severity or greater. Consequently, while the performance cannot be judged on two fatalities in 35 inflations, the data strongly sug- gests that additional field data are required before the efficacy of the airbag in mitigating injuries and fatalities can be stated with certainty. This will require hundreds of thousands of ve- hicles on the highway with the airbag and several years of high- way experience. If the airbag is to become the major safety device in automobiles, it is essential that the field study get under way immediately with a sufficient number of vehicles to provide the necessary statistical data. The estimated cost of the airbag is $185 as shown in Table 1 and includes the installation of a lap belt in each seating posi- tion. The $185 is lower than estimated by automobile manu- facturers (12,13) and is obtained from the NHTSA report (2) by subtracting the $24 sequential warning system cost from the $209.50 total cost for the air cushion and lap belt. EFFECTIVENESS OF PASSIVE THREE POINT HAR- NESS- The effectiveness of the passive three point harness in eliminating fatalities and injuries is assumed to be the same as the active three point harness with mandatory usage. While the</page><page sequence="5">1036 L. M. PATRICK effectiveness may not be as great because of possibly less than optimum positioning of the belts with the passive system, the usage is expected to be higher than the 80% estimated for the mandatory system. These two factors are assumed to offset each other so that the effectiveness remains the same at 30% for fatalities and 55% for injuries. The cost of the passive harness is assumed to be approxi- mately $70 more than the three point harness due to the mo- tors and/or other controls required with the passive system. The cost is based upon personal communication with several manufacturers who thought the cost would range from $50-90 more. In full production it will probably be less than the $135. The effectiveness values are Usted in Table 1 along with the cost. EFFECTIVENESS OF TORSO BELT AND KNEE BAR- The torso belt and knee bar (14) is assumed to be somewhat less effective than the three point harness since the elimination of the lap belt portion will probably reduce the effectiveness in side collisions, roUovers and ejection. The knees provide an exceUent place on the body to apply a decelerating force (15) so field experience may show this system to be as effective as the three point harness. However, until field experience proves this, a reduced value of 25% effectiveness for fataUties and 40% for injuries will be used as shown in Table 1 . BENEFIT/COST RATIO-The Benefit/Cost (B/C) ratio as used in this paper is simpUfied for clarity. The equation is: NpCp + N^! vc - Ñc &lt;0 where: Np = the reduction of fatalities Cp = the cost per fataUty N¡ = the reduction of injuries Cj - the cost per injury N = the number of vehicles equipped with the safety device C = the cost of the safety device for the time for which the B/C is being calculated With the simpUfied model used in this discussion, the num- ber of fataUties and injuries eUminated in any given year wiU be based upon the fraction of vehicles equipped with the sys- tem, multiplied by the effectiveness of the system, times the annual occupant death (33,500). The number of vehicles wiU depend upon how long the system has been installed and the cost of the system is based upon the figures in Table 1. It is obvious that the benefit to cost ratio (B/C) varies in- versely with the cost of the system and is a direct function of the number of fataUties eliminated, times the fataUty cost, plus the number of injuries eliminated, times the cost of each injury. Artificially inflating the cost per fataUty or injury or the number of fatalities or injuries will result in an overstate- ment of B/C as will an underestimate of the cost of the system. The B/C is predicated on the present dollar and does not in- clude any inflation or change in cost of the system over the period under consideration. Inclusion of the speculative infla- tion costs confuses the issue and does not materiaUy change the B/C for the different systems. It should be pointed out that some of the items included in the B/C, such as the effec- tiveness of the airbag system and injury cost, are highly specu- lative and based on laboratory results which can be consider- ably different from the field experience. The single exception is the three point harness for which considerable field data are available. With the estimates required in the analysis of the B/C, it is essential that a figure substantiaUy greater than one be achieved in order to provide confidence that the B/C will be cost beneficial. Even if the B/C is greater than one, there is some question about the effect of requiring the additional ex- penditure on the economy. If it is a substantial increase in cost of a product, the reduction in sales can upset the delicate balance of the economy and result in a net overall societal loss, loss. COST OF INJURIES AND FATALITIES According to the NSC (1), the cost of injuries and fatalities is as follows: 1. Wage loss- $6.6 billion 2. Medical expenses- $1.7 billion 3. Insurance administration and claims-$5.6 billion 4. Total- $13.9 billion Medical expenses are often quoted as a major part of acci- dent costs. Reviewing the above figures indicates that the medical expenses represent only about 12% of the cost of in- juries and fatalities. If the medical expense could be reduced by half, the overall gain would only represent a reduction of approximately 6% in the cost of injuries and fatalities. Wage loss is the largest single item in the cost of injuries and fatalities. It is not a true indication of societal loss since the individual is generally replaced by another employee who earns the salary. While the wage loss is a tragedy to the families, the loss to society is considerably less than indicated. Thus, it is grossly over-represented as a loss. Insurance administration and claims settlement is 3.3 times the medical expenses and appears to be a fertile field for de- creasing the overall cost of injuries and fatalities. An equitable settlement of claims in a short time following fair guidelines would eliminate long waits by the injured parties for deserved payments. This would not only eliminate suffering on the part of the injured and their dependents, but would also reduce the cost which must be borne by the rest of the population. Much of the cost is represented by attorneys' fees, court costs and nonproductive costs for preparing for trial on the part of both the plaintiff and the defendant. The long delay in settling claims when they go to litigation often results in aggravating the hardship on the injured party. In extreme cases irreparable damage is sustained by the injured party even when the litiga- tion is settled in his favor since he can be bankrupted by the long delay. Costs for administering the insurance and the fees by insurance companies and agents should be investigated to determine whether they are unreasonable and whether a modi- fication of the procedures in administrating insurance could substantially reduce the cost.</page><page sequence="6">PASSIVE AND ACTIVE RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 1 03 7 The $156,000 cost per fatality and the $4600 cost per in- jury are higher than stated by NSC (16) based upon costs from 1972. They are also higher than the figures determined by RECAT (17). On the other hand, they are lower than the costs assigned by NHTSA (2). In arriving at the costs used herein, the same source (NSC) is used for cost, injury and fa- tality data since it represents methodology in use prior to the present interest in evaluating the B/C ratio, and consequently should not be biased. O'Neill, et al. (18), state that it is inappropriate to use the B/C analysis in evaluating a motor vehicle safety standard since it has no cost per se. Design alternatives can be evaluated ac- cording to their logic if costs can be assigned. Their opinion is that costs cannot be assigned to injuries and fatalities, and therefore, Benefit/Cost ratio cannot be calculated. From a purist standpoint their opinion is correct. From a practical standpoint, costs have been assigned to injuries and fatalities and even more nebulous factors such as pain, loss of consor- tium, etc. NHTSA (2) and RECAT (17) plus many others have used the B/C concept for evaluating the effectiveness of safety devices developed to meet MVSS requirements, and it appears that some method of measuring the effect of regula- tions in terms of dollars is important if our economic system is to survive. COMPARISON OF LIVES SAVED-Each of the major fac- tors involved in the calculation of the benefit/cost ratio will be considered individually. The data for the different factors are included in Tables 2-6 for each of the five restraint systems listed in Table 1 . The data are tabulated as annual and cumu- lative results in lives saved, injury reduction, system cost, bene- fits, and benefit/cost ratio. The data were calculated on the basis of the system becoming effective on Sept. 1 , 1976 or on the 1977 model year vehicles. It is questionable whether all of the systems can be put into production by that time. But that is not a consideration in this paper. The calendar year of Column 1 in Tables 2-6 is used instead of the model year on the basis that the calendar year will rep- resent approximately one full year of use of the system in- stalled on 10 million vehicles. During the model year the first day has essentially no systems installed and the last day of the model year has 100% with approximately 50% average over the model year. If the data are based on the calendar year, the first of the calendar year has approximately half of the vehi- cles with the system installed and the end of the calendar year has about one and a half times the annual production with the system installed, for an average of about one full year of effec- tive restraint system use. Table 2 presents the data for the mandatory harness system with approximately 90% of the vehicles equipped during the first year (1977) as a result of the installation of lap and shoul- der belts starting in 1968. On the basis of 30% effectiveness and nine tenths of the vehicles equipped, 9045 lives will be saved the first year. In 1978 with the simplified model as- sumed in this study, the lap shoulder belt will be available on all vehicles and 10,050 lives will be saved in 1978 and each year thereafter. At the end of the 10 year period from 1977- 1986, 99,495 lives will have been saved. Table 3 presents the same data for the airbag plus 20% lap belt usage.

In 1986, with all of the vehicles equipped, 971 5 lives will be saved. This should be compared with the 10,050 lives that will be saved with the three point harness system in 1986. The cumulative number of lives saved from 1977-1986 is 53,433 or slightly more than half of the Uves that would be saved with the mandatory harness system requirement. The performance for the passive airbag system is presented in Table 4. In 1977 the passive airbag system will save 833 lives. Each year the number of vehicles equipped will be in- creased by 10% until 1986 when the total vehicle population is assumed to be equipped and the lives saved will be 8375. In the 10 year period, 46,064 lives will be saved. Performance for the passive three point harness is assumed to be the same as for the mandatory three point harness. As shown in Table 5 with 10% of the vehicles equipped in 1977, 1005 lives will be saved. The number will be increased each year as the fraction of vehicles with the three point passive system installed increases, until 1986 when all vehicles will be so equipped. At that time 10,050 lives will be saved annually as is the case with the mandatory three point harness system. The data for the passive torso belt and knee bar system is presented in Table 6. In 1977, 838 lives will be saved with 10% of the vehicles equipped. By 1986, 8375 lives will be saved annually and the cumulative Uves saved in a 10 year pe- riod is 46,064. A comparison of the lives saved in the 10 year period from 1977-1986 for the five systems considered can be made from the data in Table 7. The lives saved from 1977-1986 is 99,495 for the three point mandatory harness system, while the other systems result in approximately half that number ranging from 46,064-55,275. The larger number of lives saved in the 10 year span with the mandatory harness law results from the large number of systems installed prior to enactment of the law and the effectiveness of the system. The number of lives saved from 1987-1996 is presented in Table 7. The maximum number of lives saved, 100,500, is achieved with the manda- tory harness or the passive three point harness. The others range from 83,750-97,150. The gross advantage of the sys- tems already installed is obvious. Another advantage of the mandatory harness is that it is the only system that has been proven through extensive highway use. COMPARISON OF INJURY REDUCTION-The annual in- jury reduction and the accumulation over a 10 year period for each of the systems are shown in Tables 2-6. In Table 2, for the mandatory harness system, the injury reduction per year is 998,000 for 1977 and 1.1 million for each year thereafter. At the end of 1986, 10.89 million injuries will have been elimi- nated on the basis of the assumption of this analysis. Table 3 for the airbag + 20% lap belt usage starts in 1977 with an injury reduction of 60,000 and increases as the vehi- cles equipped increase until 1986 when all vehicles are assumed to be equipped and the annual reduction in injury is 600,000. In the 10 year period 3.3 million injuries will have been elimi- nated. The same data for the passive airbag system are shown in Table 4 with 56,000 injuries eliminated in 1 977 and 560,000 in 1986 for a cumulative total of 3 .08 million in the 1 0 year period. The passive three point harness data in Table 5 shows 110,000 injuries eliminated in 1977 and 1.1 million in 1986 with a cumulative total of 6.05 million in the 10 year period.</page><page sequence="8">PASSIVE AND ACTIVE RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 1 039 Table 4 - Performance, Cost and Benefit/Cost Ratio for Passive Airbag System Fract. of Vehicles Injury Reduction-}- System Cost$ Benefits Calendar with Lives Saved* (Millions) ($ Billions) ($ Billions) Year System Annual Cumulative Annual Cumulative Annual Cumulative Annual Cumulative Benefit /Cost 1977 0.1 838 838 0.056 0.056 1.85 1.85 0.388 0.388 2.1 1978 0.2 1675 2513 0.112 0.168 1.85 3.70 0.777 1.165 2.1 1979 0.3 2513 5026 0.168 0.336 1.85 5.55 1.165 2.330 2.1 1980 0.4 3350 8376 0.224 0.560 1.85 7.40 1.553 3.883 2.1 1981 0.5 4188 12,564 0.280 0.840 1.85 9.25 1.941 5.824 2.1 1982 0.6 5025 17,589 0.336 1.176 1.85 11.10 2.330 8.154 2.1 1983 0.7 5863 23,452 0.392 1.568 1.85 12.95 2.718 10.873 2.1 1984 0.8 6700 30,152 0.448 2.016 1.85 14.80 3.106 13.979 2.1 1985 0.9 7538 37,690 0.504 2.520 1.85 16.65 3.494 17.473 2.1 1986 1.0 8375 46,064 0.560 3.080 1.85 18.50 3.883 21.356 2.1 * Based on 25% effectiveness and 33,500 fatalities annually, t Based on 28% effectiveness and two million injuries annually. $System cost estimated at $185 each and 10 million cars per year. In Decade From 1977-1986: Total benefits $21.36 billion Total costs 18.50 billion Net gain $ 2.76 billion Total lives saved 46,425 Injury reduction 3,080,000 Table 6 for the passive torso belt and knee bar system starts with an injury reduction of 80,000 in 1977 and progress to 800,000 in 1986 with a cumulative reduction of injuries of 4.4 million in the 10 year period. Table 7 permits a comparison of the injury reduction for each of the five systems in the 10 year period from 1977-1986 and also a 10 year period from 1987-1996. The mandatory harness shows a gain of 10.89 million in injury reduction in the first 10 year period and 1 1 million in the second 10 year period. The other systems range from 3.08-6.05 million in the 1977-1986 decade. A mandatory harness system results in a much greater injury reduction than the other systems because the fleet is almost fully equipped during the entire time while the other systems start with 10% the first year and increase to 100% in the 10th year. In the second 10 year period (1987-1996) the mandatory harness law results in approximately the same number of in- jury mitigations while the other systems improve considerably since the complete vehicle fleet is equipped during the second 10 year period. The passive three point harness saves the same number of lives as the mandatory harness since the effective- ness is assumed to be the same. The airbag is the least effective since it contributes little to injury reduction in side and roll- over accidents. COMPARISON OF SYSTEM COST-The estimated cost for each of the five systems is shown in Table 1 with the three point harness as the least expensive and the airbag lap belt combination the most expensive. The torso belt and knee bar is slightly more costly than the three point harness. In produc- tion it could actually result in a lower cost than the three point harness since the lap belt is eliminated and the modification to the instrument panel for the knee restraint could cost essen- tially nothing if correctly designed. In considering the relative cost of the airbag compared to the harness systems and taking the complexity of the airbag system with its sensor and com- plicated inflating mechanism, it appears that the 3: 1 ratio for the airbag as compared to the three point harness is conserva- tive, with a greater ratio of airbag to harness costs likely. The additional cost of the airbag system coupled with the lower performance makes the three point harness more attractive from a cost and effectiveness standpoint. When comparing estimated costs, the total costs for the purchaser should be considered, including the overhead and profit. COMPARISON OF SYSTEM BENEFIT -The benefits from the various systems based upon the reduction in fatalities and injuries at the rates specified are shown in Tables 2-6. Table 2 shows that the mandatory harness system would achieve a benefit of $5.97 billion the first year and $6.63 billion each year thereafter. The cumulative benefit over the 10 year pe- riod are $65.62 billion. The benefits for the airbag plus 20% lap belt usage is indi- cated in Table 3 as $0.428 billion the first year with the amount increasing each year as additional vehicles are equipped with maximum annual benefits of $4.28 billion in the 10th year. During this time, the cumulative benefits are $23.52 billion. The airbag passive system has an initial benefit of $0.388 billion the first year as indicated in Table 4 increasing to $3.88 billion the 10th year with a cumulative saving of $21.36 billion. The passive three point belt is assumed to have the same performance as the mandatory three point system but starts at</page><page sequence="9">1040 L.M.PATRICK only 10% installation the first year which results in approxi- mately 10% of the benefit at 0.663 billion. The value increases to 6.63 billion at the end of 10 years which is the same as the annual benefit of the three point harness after the first year. The cumulative benefits amount to $36.46 billion at the end of the 10 year period. The torso belt and knee bar system as indicated in Table 6 produces $0.50 billion in benefits the first year and increases to 4.99 billion in the 10th year. The cumulative benefits amount to $27.41 billion over the 10 year period. At the bot- tom of the Tables 2-6, the net gain for each system is pre- sented. It is also tabulated in Table 7 for the five systems for 1977-1986 and 1987-1996. The net benefit for the first 10 year period of $59 billion for the three point harness is much higher than the benefit from the other system. Part of the reason for the greater benefits is that the three point harness is installed in practically all of the cars over the 10 year period while the other systems start at 10% of the cars the first year increasing to 100% in the 10th year according to the simplified model. In the second 10 year period, the mandatory harness produces a net gain of $59.7 billion with the passive three point harness approaching it at $52.8 billion. The other sys- tems result in considerably less gain. The airbag alone pro- duces about a third of the net gain when compared to the mandatory three point harness. It should be noted that at the end of the first 1 0 year pe- riod, the entire vehicle population is equipped with the sys- tems which provides a substantial reduction in fatalities and injuries in the following 10 year period. This represents a sub- stantial investment in safety, ranging from $6.6 billion for the mandatory harness to $18.5 billion for the airbag-lap belt sys- tem. With such a large investment it is essential that the best system be installed. COMPARISON OF BENEFIT/COST RATIO-Tables 2-6 list the benefit/cost ratio for each of the 10 years from 1977- 1986 for the five systems under consideration. Table 2 for the mandatory harness system shows the highest B/C starting at 90.5 the first year and decreasing 10.1 in the 10th year and every year thereafter. The extraordinary high B/C the first year is due to the large number of systems installed which do not add any cost to the vehicle population but which will be used with the mandatory law. Each year up to 1986 the B/C decreases due to the increasing fraction of vehicles for which the harness system has been included in the cost. The B/C for the other systems shown in Tables 3-6 vary from a low of 2.1 for the passive airbag system to 6.7 for the passive torso belt and knee bar system. Even after 10 years the mandatory harness system has a better B/C ratio than any of the other systems. With no appreciable field experience with systems other than the harness system it is possible that the assumptions can be in error enough to result in a B/C ratio of less than one. For example, if the airbag cost is $388 instead of $185, the B/C ratio will be one. Some of the estimates for the airbag system have exceeded the $388 and many of them approach it. Another factor which is important in the cost of the airbag system is the maintenance and replacement cost. The mainte- nance could be extremely high if the system has to be replaced Table 5 - Performance, Cost and Benefit/Cost Ratio for Passive Three Point Harness Fract. of Vehicles Injury Reductionf System Costi Benefits Calendar 3 Pt.

Since there has been in- adequate experience on the longevity of the different compo- nents of the airbag system under the extreme environmental conditions encountered during the lifetime of an automobile it is possible that the complete system would have to be re- placed. The effect of time, temperature variations, humidity and vibration on the system or its components could result in deterioration to the point where they would all have to be re- placed. In that event, the benefit/cost ratio would be less than one. After a collision, replacement of the airbag system would add an estimated $300-500 to the repair of the car. The high replacement cost is based upon the cost of the airbag system plus trained technicians to install and check the system con- taining explosive materials. On the other hand, the replacement of a harness, if re- quired, would be much lower since only those components damaged in the accident would have to be replaced. Also the replacement is not complicated and would consequently be less expensive. Experience with belt systems shows they do not have to be replaced in normal use during the lifetime of the vehicle. COST-EFFECTIVENESS Effectiveness in terms of lives saved, injuries eliminated and monetary gain is summarized in Table 7. Since the base is the same for each of the parameters and the goals for each system are identical, the overall effectiveness of the systems can be equitably compared for the performance assumption utilized. As previously discussed and summarized in Table 7, the mandatory harness system is the most effective of the five sys- tems in the first 10 years of operation, and exceeds all of the other systems except the passive three point system in the sec- ond 10 years which it equals in lives saved and injuries elimi- nated and exceeds in net gain and Benefit/Cost ratio. Thus the cost-effectiveness of the mandatory harness system obviously exceeds the other systems by a substantial amount. Table 8 provides another method of comparing the cost ef- fectiveness. In Table 8 only the direct cost is considered rather than the benefit achieved by the different systems. Since the direct cost is divided between the benefits in reduction of fatal- ities and injuries, the best comparison can be made by estab- lishing the direct cost per casualty. Since there is no way to equate fatalities and injuries, the direct cost will be assigned to the fatalities and injuries individually. Thus, when the direct cost per fatality is discussed it will be on the basis that the total cost is assigned to fatalities. Similarly, when the direct cost per injury is considered, the total cost will be assigned to injuries without consideration for the fatalities. With this method of analyzing the cost, it is obvious that the direct cost per casualty reduction is understated. The annual cost for each of the systems is included in Table 8 on the First Year Cost basis. The mandatory harness system obviously costs less than any of the other systems. The first year cost per casualty estimated is based upon the assump- tion that when an individual makes an investment, the immedi- ate return is often an overriding factor with a smaller gain over a long period unacceptable. In considering the first year for the different systems, the mandatory harness cost per fatality and/or injury is only 8.3% of the torso belt and knee bar which is the next lowest cost system on this basis and only 3.3% of the direct cost of the airbags.</page><page sequence="11">1042 L.

Thus, the direct costs for the man- datory harness is approximately 1/30 on the first year basis and one third that of the airbag on the distributed cost basis. On the first year cost amortization basis the direct cost of elimination of each injury is $670 for the mandatory harness while it is $33,000 for the airbag. On the distributed cost ba- sis, the cost per injury reduction for the mandatory harness is $600 and $3300 for the airbag or 5.5 times as high. Conse- quently, on the direct cost basis, the cost effectiveness of the mandatory harness is considerably better than all of the other systems, with the torso belt and knee bar the next least costly and the airbag the most costly. DISCUSSION It is important to note the gains that are immediately avail- able from a mandatory harness law. Essentially, the complete vehicle fleet will be equipped immediately with the safety fea- ture. The other systems will result in only 10% of the fleet being equipped the first year that they are required. Further- more, the proposed time schedule of requiring a passive system by the 1977 model year does not appear to be feasible. Conse- quently, the passive system will probably be postponed for at least a year beyond the presently proposed September 1 , 1976 date. On the other hand, the mandatory harness law could be enacted sooner than that if Congress so desires. For every year the mandatory harness system is not required, approximately 10,000 lives are lost and one million occupants are injured needlessly. Enactment of the mandatory harness law would be bene- ficial even if the passive system is required at a later date. Dur- ing the 10 years required to equip the complete vehicle fleet with the passive system, the fraction of the vehicles without passive systems would still provide protection through the mandatory harness requirement. With the mandatory harness requirement and the assumption that the airbag is a passive sys- tem with the performance assumed herein, the first year with the mandatory harness and the passive airbag system would re- sult in a saving of 8878 lives instead of the 838 lives for the airbag alone. The value would reduce to 7705 in the eighth year and then increase to a constant 8375 lives saved during the 10th year and each year thereafter. The total number of lives saved in the 10 year period required to equip the com- plete fleet is 82,245 with the combined mandatory harness and passive airbag system, while with the passive system only</page><page sequence="12">PASSIVE AND ACTIVE RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 1 043 the value is 46,064. The net saving in lives by the two systems is 36,181 . Thus, 79% more lives would be saved with the man- datory harness law in effect during the time the airbag is being installed in the complete fleet with even larger gains in injury reduction. OPTIONAL HARNESS OR AIRBAG-Much has been said about the infringement on individual rights by requiring the use of a harness system. When Congress removed the require- ment for the interlock system, the main reason given was the objection of the individuals to being required to submit to the harness system. It is the author's opinion that the rights of those individuals who are convinced that the harness system provides a greater latitude of protection than the airbag are being infringed upon if they are required to purchase a less ef- fective system. One method of overcoming this difficulty is to permit the individual to make a choice of the passive system or the use of the harness system. In fact, this eliminates one of the problems of mandating the use of the harness. Under this plan the individual purchasing a vehicle would be given the op- tion of buying either the harness system or the passive system. If the choice is for the harness system, anybody riding in the car agrees to wear the harness. Furthermore, if this is required the courts would back up the requirement by reducing or eliminating claims for those occupants not wearing the harness if they are involved in a collision. NHTSA-TSC REPORT (2)-Injury reduction or elimination is not the all-or-none situation implied in the NHTSA report (2). In the more severe collisions the elimination of a fatality may be accompanied by the addition of a severe injury. Simi- larly, as the collision severity decreases the degree of injury will decrease. Therefore, when injury elimination is referred to in this paper, it represents a condition of an average reduc- tion in severity of injury or injuries to the point where $4600, or the cost of an average injury, is eliminated. The NHTSA-TSC Report (2) appears to be grossly biased toward the airbag system. The assumption of the benefits achieved by the airbag system are unfounded in the oblique collision situation. The authors of that report ignore the find- ings in the field that show the harness system to be effective at the 25% level overall (9), and higher than 25% in other investi- gations (4,6). The NHTSA Report (2) states on page 9 ". . . Cadavers re- ceived fatal level injuries when being restrained by lap-shoulder belt systems while in similar environments, human volunteer test subjects with air-cushion restraints received minor or no injury." The source of these fatal cadaver injuries was not in- cluded in the report. To the contrary, a DOT progress report (19) on a contract using unembalmed cadavers, showed no fatal injuries at 30 mph simulation and in fact only one AIS-3 and two AIS-1 injuries for the three cadavers exposed to a 30 mph barrier equivalent simulation. Schmidt (14) reported on 49 cadavers subjected to 30 mph collisions with numerous se- vere injuries. However, his deceleration pulse was far more se- vere than the deceleration pulse in a vehicle collision even of the most severe barrier equivalent type. The NHTSA report states "... human volunteers have en- dured about three times the acceleration with air cushions . . . compared to highly developed, sophisticated belt systems . . ." The source of "three times the acceleration" is not clear since the deceleration pulse and other data were not provided. In any case the objective of the restraint system is to protect the occupants of vehicles in collisions- not to subject humans to high accelerations. Glenn (5) reports on volunteer runs up to 30 mph with human volunteers and a three point harness sys- tem. Smith, et al. (20), reports on a 30 mph barrier crash with a full size vehicle. Glenn (5) conducted sled tests for "com- pact or subcompact cars." Since the subcompact car generally has a more severe deceleration pulse then the full size car, the volunteers with the harnesses were supposedly subjected to a more severe collision simulation than those of the airbag volun- teers reported by Smith, et al. (20). NHTSA (2) stated that the real world accident data on re- strained occupants were analyzed and support the extrapola- tion made in the report. Teal, et al. (21), reported on vehicles which had crash recorders installed and compared the results of the change in velocity as measured by the crash recorder with that reported by the investigating teams. In most cases the investigating teams reported a much higher velocity than the crash recorder. There was some ambiguity in the reports by the investigating team since they reported "impact speeds, speed, traveling speed, impact velocity, speed difference at im- pact, velocity change, and barrier equivalent impact velocity." Several of the terms are used interchangeably in the reporting. Regardless of the terminology, the reported speed was usually greater by a considerable amount than the change in speed in- dicated by the recorder. Consequently, extrapolating the laboratory data to the field data on the air cushions would be unsatisfactory. On this basis, the most likely effective- ness of 41% for fatalities and 36% for injuries for the airbag equipped vehicle is completely unrealistic since the limited number of accidents does not permit "real world" support of the data. The harness data were supposedly extrapolated the same way and the result was 18% most likely effectiveness for fatali- ties and 12% most likely effectiveness for injuries. In the case of the harnesses, extrapolation is not required since the field data show the effectiveness to be considerably greater than the reported 18% and 12% for fatality and injury reduction re- spectively. The limited field experience with airbags consists of 35 col- lisions severe enough to cause inflation, most of which were of low severity where serious injury would not be expected with no restraint system of any type. In many of the car to car col- lisions, the occupants in the non airbag car sustained essen- tially the same or a less severe injury than the occupants of the airbag equipped car. The sample is too small to rate degree of injury with collision severity. The report does not refer to the two fatalities out of 35 col- lisions severe enough to cause inflation of the airbag. While these fatalities could be considered as unusual, they neverthe- less represent statistics that are comparable to those reported in harness systems where the only requirement for a fatal occu- pant statistic is a fatality in the accident with no reference as to whether or not the accident was survivable.</page><page sequence="13">1044 L.M.PATRICK CONCLUSIONS Based upon the foregoing analysis, the following conclu- sions are reached: 1 . The mandatory three point harness is the best of the five systems as indicated by the summary in Tables 7 and 8 on the basis of lives saved, injury reduction, direct cost, benefit/ cost ratio and net monetary gain. 2. Since the introduction of the safety consciousness in the early 1960s and the Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (MVSS) after 1966, the fatality rate has not shown an im- provement over the extrapolated 1933-1960 data (Fig. 1). 3. The ranking in order of the highest to the lowest per- formance for fatality and injury reduction is: 3.1 Mandatory harness 3.2 Passive three point harness 3.3 Airbag + 20% lap belt usage 3.4 Torso belt and knee bar 3.5 Airbag (3.3 is better than 3.4 in fatality reduction and 3.4 is better than 3.3 in injury reduction, see Table 1). 4. Ranking the systems in order of cost with the lowest cost first is: 4.1 Mandatory harness system ($66) 4.2 Torso and knee bar ($74) 4.3 Passive three point harness ($135) 4.4 Airbag and lap belt ($ 1 85) 5. The ranking based upon the highest Benefit/Cost ratio to the lowest ratio: 5.1 Mandatory harness 90.5 first year- 10.1 tenth and following years. 5.2 Torso belt and knee bar (6.7) 5.3 Passive three point harness (4.9) 5.4 Airbag + 20% belt use (2.3) 5.5 Airbag (2.1) 6. The mandatory harness is the best of these systems from the cost -effectiveness standpoint. 7. The mandatory harness has a major advantage in that essentially 100% of the vehicle fleet will be so-equipped at the time the mandatory law is enacted while the other systems re- quire 10 years to equip the entire fleet based upon the simpli- fied model. 8. The air cushion should not be required until field expe- rience shows it to be effective. This will require approximately 100,000 units installed for general field use over a period of two to three years. Since the system is being mandated by NHTSA, the government should finance the experimental sys- tem for the field trial. 9. The mandatory harness law would be beneficial over the 10 year period required to equip the entire vehicle popula- tion with any of the other systems, with 36,000 additional lives saved. 10. The mandating of airbag systems in all vehicles grossly encroaches on the rights of those individuals who are con- vinced that the harness system is preferable to the air cushion system. Consequently, the individual should have the right to choose whether he wants the three point harness (with agree- ment to use it) or the airbag system. 1 1 . The NHTSA-TSC Report (2) is grossly biased in favor of the airbag. REFERENCES 1. "Accident Facts." Chicago: National Safety Council, 1974 Edition. 2.
