<plain_text><page sequence="1">Evolution. Conklin. The Direction of Human Evolution. By Edward Grant Conklin. Humphrey Milford (Oxford University Press). London, 1921. 12s. 6d. net. Uf In this interesting little volume the author depicts in outline the past, present, and future of man from various points of view, but always with a biological foreground. The first section, on the " Paths and Possibilities of Human Evolution," is a condensed but lucid account of how we come to be what we are, and of the reasons for believing that the evolution of man, the individual, has run its course.

The second section discusses " Evolution and Democracy," and, as might be expected, the author has difficulties in getting his picture all in focus at the same time. This is no doubt partly due to the lack of definition characteristic of the democratic idea, when applied to the setting-up of governments, but one is disposed to doubt whether democracy can be fitted into any biological scheme of composition. It is, perhaps, a bigger thing than biology can embrace, and it is certain that, at the present time, its future calls for faith as well as works. This faith the author has, though he does not overlook the difficulties both of theory and of practice. Indeed, he quotes figures, obtained by tests applied during the war, which appear to demonstrate that nearly one half of the population of the United States are incapable of developing a mental capacity beyond that of a normal child of twelve years of age; and that only some 13 per cent. will ever show " superior intelligence." How then, with such a substratum, can the people govern themselves ? In existing so-called democratic countries, formulke have been found which enable a shrewd and more or less educated minority-together with various camp-followers, hereditary or other-to use the mass-reaction as a means of election to grace and office, and one wonders if the future has anything better in store than a rationalised version of the counting of heads at their hottest. But human thought is a disorderly affair, and salvation by formulke is not confined to politicians. The third section, on " Evolution and Religion," contains little that will be contested by biologists, and much that they will unreservedly approve. The debris of religious anthropomorphism is always with us, and, although much of the dust settles down after each sweeping, something is done towards clearing away the rubbish. One welcomes the author's observations on spiritualism, in view of recent unfortunate demonstrations that a keen brain may have a feather edge. The book is based on lectures, and has the limitations imposed by this method of presentation, but as a clearly-reasoned digest of the author's views-represent- ative as they are in character-on fundamental topics, it may be read with profit both by those to whom the facts and ideas are familiar, and by those whose interest in the biological outlook is greater than their knowledge.
