<plain_text><page sequence="1">NAFTALI PRAT DIAMAT AND CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGY Official Soviet ph?osophy has always laid great stress on biology. This is only natural since the ph?osophic interpretation of biology serves as the acid test for diamat's pretension to be a ph?osophy of nature which overcomes both mechanicism and vitaUsm (in the wide sense of the terms). Diamat asserts that the phenomena of Ufe can be explained solely through the action of material forces without invocation of 'entelechy', 'soul', 'vital force', or any other immaterial factor; at the same time, it asserts that Ufe is a special form of the motion of matter, quaUtatively higher than the other forms - typical of non Uving nature, and not reducible to them. life can be adequately conceived and explained only with the help of the materiaUst dialectic: this central thesis of Soviet ph?osophy of biology has remained constant throughout the stormy history of the association between Marxism-Leninism and biology. Already at the early stages of diamat as a systematic ph?osophy, obligatory for all, there were disputes among Soviet Marxists on the philosophic import of the biological sciences. The dispute between the 'mechanists' and the 'dialecticians' as antithetical diamat positions, broke out with the publication of a Uttle book by I. Stepanov, Historical Materialism and Contemporary Science, where there was question of diamat and evolution. In these disputes the 'mechanists' principaUy leaned toward a 'mechano Lamarckism' while the 'dialecticians' emerged as proponents of scientific genetics and neo-Darwinism. However, the distinction between them was not always that clear; and, in any case, the campaign against 'Menshevizing idealism' at the start of the 1930s affected scientific genetics and resulted in 1948 in the dominance of Lysenkoism. These dark pages belong to the past. Today, in the Soviet Union, the biological sciences enjoy the same freedom of concrete research as the other natural sciences (but not the social sciences). AU the scientist need do is interpret his results in the Ught of diamat. Diamat emerges not as a phi losophy of nature, but as a ph?osophy of science which adapts itself to the 'reality' that science reveals. As a result, the 'biological reaUty' that diamat possesses consists of the most general laws which in their turn have a Studies in Soviet Thought 21 (1980) 181-209. 0039-3797/80/0213-0181 $02.90.

The materialist dialectic is said to be the universal method and logic of knowledge. AppUed specificaUy to biology this 'universal method' consists of specific demands on scientific knowledge: above aU, that any conclusions that seem to conflict with diamat have to be rejected and the data-base re-examined to eUminate the apparent conflict. To avoid the charge of dogmatism, the apologists of Soviet ph?osophy of biology claim that diamat as methodology is not brought to biology from the outside, but grows out of biology itself. Engels, it must be remembered, claimed that scientific discoveries bring scien tists spontaneously to a dialectical understanding of nature. An understanding of the laws of dialectical thought can speed up this process. FoUowing Lenin in Materialism and Empirio-Criticism, Soviet authors see an ever-increasing emergence of dialectic and materialism in contemporary science. This emergence is opposed by those who under capitaUsm are inclined toward an ideaUst interpretation of science. According to the current Soviet view, biology ? unlike the social sciences ? does not have a class-character. Although they must continue to maintain that biology is an arena of ideo logical conflict, they interpret this as having to do with philosophical inter pretation, rather than with hard science. In this, too, they are faithful to Lenin who stated that brilUant scientists often make mediocre philosophers.1 It is Lenin's critique of 'physical ideaUsm' that serves as model for the Soviet view on the conflict of scientific, especially biological, ideas. Lenin asserted, on the one hand, that the progress of science inevitably leads to the development of the diamat conception of nature and, on the other, that the very scientists that are being impeUed toward this diamat view suffer from impediments. The conservative atmosphere of their education and work make them incUned toward the wrong sort of ph?osophizing.2 Soviet phi losophers recognize a number of leading biologists who, wh?e fighting against 'ideaUsm' remain 'pawns of the bourgeois ideology', especially in the under standing of social phenomena. Among these one finds J. S. Huxley, C. D. DarUngton, Th. Dobzhansky and J. H. MuUer - aU of whom use biological categories for the explanation of social phenomena. According to the Soviet critics, they aU end in eclecticism, the best exempUfication of which is the 'transhumanism' of Huxley, ending up in a new, 'humanist' ph?osophy of religion. The main attack of the Soviet ph?osophers today, however, is aimed at a smaU group of vitaUsts ? E. Sinnott, I. Haas, A. Portmann, G. Schramm and</page><page sequence="3">DIAMAT AND CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGY 183 others, for whom ph?osophy is rather a side-line. Another favorite target of Soviet attack are the neo-vitaUsts and ideologists, like G. CorneUus-Martius, G. Wetter, A. Meyer-Abich. The most vicious attacks are reserved by the Soviets for those who deny the possib?ity of a purely naturaUst explanation of the phenomenon of Ufe, for this is seen as an attack on Lenin's assertion of the link between ideaUsm and fideism.3 The fight against reUgion is the vital core of Soviet ph?osophy of biology. The Soviet critics of neo-vitaUsm and teleologism pay most attention to questions which arise from the ph?osophical impotence of mechanicism and which do not touch directly the biologist's empirical work. These include: the problem of progress and directionaUty in the organic world; the problem of the origins of biological auto-regulation; the hoUstic character of Uving systems; the factors of evolution and the formation of new species. According to the Soviets, aU these can be solved only on the basis of diamat; all other efforts at solution end up in 'biological idealism'. With joy and satisfaction, Soviet philosophers point out that there is no influential school of 'biological idealism' today. Science, for example, is more and more clarifying those mysteries that led to the formation of the various forms of vitaUsm. This does not mean, according to the Soviets, that vitaUsm is dead; it simply has less and less factual ground. Although current forms of vitaUsm cannot be reduced, for the Soviets, to earlier forms of 'idealism in biology', one stiU finds the search for a supra-sensible 'vital factor' which would quaUtatively distinguish organic from inorganic nature. According to Soviet ph?osophers, the most serious epistemol?gica! error of the vitalists is their identification of materiaUsm with mechanicism. It is in fact the Soviet view that the introduction of the categories of diamat obviates the old dUemma between mechanicism and vitaUsm: in effect, the irreduci b?ity of organic processes to physical and chemical processes is not identical to an impossibiUty of providing a materiaUst explanation for vital processes. Materialism in biology has overcome its earUer 'metaphysical' phase to become 'dialectical'. One Soviet author puts it this way: In contemporary science the researcher who is capable of studying the essence of ever more complex objects, is master of the basic principles of dialectical science, originating as a new quality out of the exponentially increasing range of objects.4 However, this instinctual turning toward dialectical science is, according to Soviet accounts, not enough; scientists must more and more consciously turn</page><page sequence="4">184 NAFTALI PRAT to diamat as universal method. It is not enough that people like von Ber talanffy (in his invention of systems theory) operate in an instinctuaUy dialectical way. There is the even stranger case of G. Simpson ? founder of the 'synthetic theory of evolution' in paleontology ? who is opposed to mechanicism as weU as to vitaUsm and teleology but refuses to be caUed a materiaUst; he caUs himself a 'reaUst'. AU Soviet philosophers are convinced of the proposition that scientists have to be brought to a clear and explicit diamat position, which uses concepts which are ? according to the EngUsh biologist, C. H. Waddington ? "almost, if not exactly, identical with those which are basic to a scientific approach to nature"5. Therefore, the pretension of diamat to be the general methodology of science is based on a reformulation of the nature of science and of nature, both of which are said by Soviet ph?osophers to have a dialectical character. A few comments on this are in order before we go on to consider some key questions in Soviet ph?osophy of biology. First of aU, the Soviet authors are quite correct in asserting that many of the central questions of biology are philosophic in nature: 'vitaUsm', 'mechanicism', 'reductionism', 'organicism', 'determinism', 'teleologism' ? aU of these are central to biological theory and are pre-eminently phi losophic in character. However, the notion of 'general methodology of science', which the Soviets counterpose to the notion of 'ph?osophy of nature' is not without its problems. As Wetter has pointed out, this general diamat methodology of science contains a series of more specific propositions which it wants to take as axiomatic for science.6 This means in the case of biology, that the theories have to serve for the confirmation of diamat or risk being rejected as 'idealist' or 'mechanicist'; and this robs diamat of its role as 'general' method. Although a whole series of Soviet ph?osophers (Kedrov, Kopnin, Frolov, among others) have opposed the idea of a phi losophy of nature for diamat, it would seem to follow from the above that diamat must indeed have some sort of ph?osophy of nature; flowing, e.g., from the assertion as to the material unity of the world, the attributive nature of motion, the irreducib?ity of higher forms of motion to the lower, etc. Even the rejection of mechanicism and vitaUsm and of the dilemma between them can be done only on the basis of a certain 'Marxist ph?osophy of nature' ? which seems to be distasteful as a term to Soviet philosophers because they associate it with the ph?osophies of nature of the past (SchelUng et al).</page><page sequence="5">DIAMAT AND CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGY 185 We have to agree with I. T. Frolov ? one of the leading Soviet specialists in ph?osophy of biology ? when he says: The philosophic conclusions, without which science, according to Lenin, cannot get along, are precisely philosophic in that they go beyond the confines of concrete science and also of that 'pure methodology of scientific research', the necessity for which is not denied even by the proponents of contemporary neopositivist 'philosophy of science'.7 It is hard to agree, however, with the same author when he says that these ph?osophic conclusions have nothing in common with ph?osophy of nature. He contradicts himself when he accuses both positivism and philosophy of nature of "trying to escape the consequence that aU ph?osophizing exceeds the Umits of positive science".8 The reduction of ph?osophy of science to methodology and logic is characteristic of contemporary positivism. When the Soviet ph?osophers of science try to avoid such a reduction in the case of diamat by saying that ph?osophy has to do with the 'reaUty' established by science, they forget that this artificial reaUty cannot but be based on ph?osophic and even metaphysical principles which are beyond aU mere empyria. Diamat's effort to take a third position between positivism and ph?osophy of nature is reflected in biology in a third position between vitaUsm and mechanicism. Wh?e we w?l take up the latter below, in reference to the former it is clear that in order to avoid faUing between two stools, Soviet ph?osophers have been obUged w?ly-niUy to develop a ph?osophy of nature. There is no doubt that diamat constantly tries to turn modern scientific developments to its advantage. Thus, it is true that vitalism is currently losing ground and that reductionism is out of favor. What remains to be seen is the extent to which these developments are 'dialectical'. Concerning the 'materialism' of official Soviet ph?osophy, we need spend few words, as it has been pointed out by many critics that the term 'matter' is so widely defined as to include anything. 'NaturaUsm' might be the better term for their effort to explain the world from bottom to top, from simple to complex, without recourse to supernatural factors. In science this naturalism takes a form sim?ar to that of F. A. Lange's 'methodological materiaUsm', namely concentration on the material aspect of natural processes as more ava?able to knowledge. When Frolov and his ilk deny the 'dialectic of living nature' in favor of the 'problem of the dialectification of the theoretical bases of science', they are</page><page sequence="6">186 NAFTALI PRAT putting a methodological materiaUsm in the place of a metaphysical material ism. Obviously, they are not choosing to do this but are forced to it impUcitly by the presence of the 'objective dialectic'. When we counterpose method ological materiaUsm to the metaphysical materialism of diamat, the latter is not counterposed to 'dialectical materiaUsm', but simply indicates that diamat is indubitably a metaphysical system. The epistemol?gica! grounds of this ph?osophy demand recognition of scientific theories as reflections of objective reaUty; as subjective maps, to which correspond facts which exist objectively, independent of any subject ('material' in the terminology of diamat). Therefore, diamat requires as biological correlate to its 'dialectic of nature', an ontologized 'dialectic of Uving nature' - which Frolov rejects. Frolov is trying to avoid the traditional dogmatism and naivete of Lysenkoism while not breaking with the axioms of Engels and Lenin. His attempt does not come off. CharacteristicaUy, when Soviet ph?osophers of biology turn to critique others it is the ontological problematic that comes to the fore. They talk about the 'forms of the motion of matter', the specifically 'biological form of material motion', the 'transformation of the chemical into the biological' ? aU problems which belong rather to ph?osophy of nature than to epistemology. Nevertheless, Frolov insists on the primacy of the epistemol?gica!. He writes: "The efforts of ph?osophers have to be clearly devoted now to the analysis of theoretical construction, methods, etc., of contemporary scientific knowledge of the laws and logic of living nature." 9 Frolov's methodological emphasis seems grounded in a strengthened version of diamat's notion of truth. The path toward objective truth in science is by no means straight. Truth is an integral whole, composed of elements which have relative value and which are limited by the level of science. Truth as a process where isolated stages are absolutized and certain propositions are over-extended turns into its opposite. This is the important thing that diamat has to say about knowledge as a contradictory phenomenon.10 In his careful examination of the various biological methods, Frolov points to their complex relations (coordination, domination, subordination, differ entiation, etc.) and to the dangers of overemphasizing some to the detriment of others. Biology was once dominated by the descriptive and comparative methods; it is now dominated by experimental and mathematical methods. Frolov sees such domination as conditioned by the very development of biology itself. For Frolov, aU biological methods are "only component parts</page><page sequence="7">DIAMAT AND CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGY 187 of the dialectical method in its specific appUcations to knowledge of the laws of Uving nature".11 This shows that Frolov takes 'dialectical method' in a very wide sense and makes clear why he protests against reduction of it to 'traits' and 'laws': Dialectic as a method is not a simple system of formal rules of knowing, rigidly applied to any domain of science. It is, to use an expression of Hegel, 'the soul and concept of the content', the 'inner form', where flow the conceptualized results of concrete scien tific research, which emerge (after logical elaboration in terms of the specific object of investigation) in the form of definite demands on thought. In the realm of biology there is an inevitable 'epistemol?gica! adaptation' of general principles and methods to the specific forms which the object takes. Of course, this does not affect the logical forms of thought but does influence the methods.12 As we have seen, such modifications of the dialectical method are nothing more than the concretization of some general ph?osophic principles relative to biology. But, it seems to us that these progressive adaptations have in fluenced diamat in such a way that it is no longer what it was in the 1930s. Sidney Hook once said, that the dialectical method could have meaning only if it were a synonym for scientific method.13 That which Soviet philosophers understand as dialectical method seems indeed to have come to mean - under the influence of the positive sciences ? scientific method tout court, once the pseudo-HegeUan rhetoric was pared away. It is the grounding of this proposition which w?l occupy us below. LIFE As the Soviet ph?osophers quite pertinently point out, the question on the essence of life and on the ways of knowing it is central to biology. Having dialecticaUy overcome the false d?emma between vitalism and mechanicism, Soviet ph?osophers of biology go directly to the issue of the similarities and differences between the organic and inorganic. FoUowing the principle of the dialectical unity of theory and practice, they affirm that the question on the essence of Ufe w?l be definitively answered when man has been able to create Ufe experimentaUy. In this they are true to Engels.14 The essence of Ufe has been, according to diamat, a bone of contention between materialists and ideaUsts. What mechanistic materialism could not do, diamat does, foUowing Engels' "life is the mode of existence of protein bodies, the essential element of which consists in continual metabolic</page><page sequence="8">188 NAFTALI PRAT interchange with the natural environment outside them .. . ".15 Repeated ad nauseam, this definition had, nevertheless, to be revised both for the sake of the working biologists and for the work of the ph?osophers. Speaking to the issue of revision of Engels' views, B. M. Kedrov said: The question as to the archaic character of Engels' views is badly phrased. What is out dated? We must distinguish. All that specifically belongs to science in the last quarter of the 19th Century is outdated. All that has the general character of methodological positions from the viewpoint of the materialist dialectic and of thought itself ? and which Engels used to resolve the methodological problems of the science of his time - is not outdated and remains important today.16 What the erstwh?e preservers of the Engelsian heritage forget is that Engels himself was aware of his own deficiencies.17 Engel's dictum opened two paths to diamat in its search for a definition of the Uving being: through specification of the material substrate, or through specification of the form of motion. The ideal definition would unite these two. There arose then, after Lysenkoism disappeared, the issue of the substances that could serve as bearers of Ufe. For a time the tremendous advances in molecular biology led some Soviets to look for a primitive 'Uving molecule', only to be rebuffed. According to Frolov, The idea of 'living molecules' as basic to life is as bankrupt as the postulate on 'vital forces'. The attributes of life as a complex process would, on such a hypothesis, be reduced exclusively to one level of living matter. Discovery of the material bases of life requires investigation of correlations among differentiated cells in interaction with their constituent parts. Reduction of the holistic process to one molecule is impossible since it is well-known that even the macro-molecule - the most important for life - does not show vital signs except in interaction with other macro-molecules.18 Those who wish to preserve Engels' definition are obUged to expand the notion of 'protein'. Thus, L. A. Ermolova proposes that "the definition of life of F. Engels conserves its vaUdity ... if we expand it currently to include nucleoproteids".19 Since, according to Engels, an attribute of the living being is metabolism, some virologists were inclined to question his definition because of the existence of forms of Ufe (e.g. spores) not essentiaUy related to metabolic processes. But, the overwhelming majority of Soviet ph?osophers of biology have not been w?ling to go along with such a revision and cling to metabolism as an essential characteristic of Ufe.</page><page sequence="9">DIAMAT AND CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGY 189 There are also difficulties relating to the distinction between a Uving being (a certain form of organized system, Umited spatiaUy and relatively independent of the environment) and Ufe itself (the internal state of such a system). M. M. Kamsilov defines Ufe as a biotic cycle, lying outside particular organisms and including all Uving beings, linked by certain relationship.20 The bearer of Ufe would then be the biosphere or, to foUow V. I. Vernadskij, the tegument of the earth with its organic unity of animal and mineral elements. The Uving being, in turn, can be described not only in terms of its physical and chemical constitution, but also from the viewpoint of its structural organization. Already in 1935, E. S. Bauer saw the essential distinction between Uving and non-Uving in the constant instabiUty of life forms.21 The introduction into biology of systems theory not only opened up the possibility of more precise and mathematical descriptions of the Uving system, it also led to the view that Uving systems violate in a certain sense the second law of thermodynamics, that - as E. Schr?dinger said - they are marked by 'negentropy'.22 A 'materiaUst' explanation for this seemingly 'anti-natural' phenomenon is yet to be found. As P. Kuznecov wrote in the Filosofskaja enciklopedija: There remains the problem of how in nature there is a transition from processes of increasing entropy to those which ignore entropy. A further difficulty lies in the fact that there is not yet an exact definition of entropy. (This question should not be con fused with that on calculating entropy). Not knowing 'what' increases in inorganic nature, we are hard pressed to see what is lacking in vital phenomena.23 Kuznecov ends with the suggestion that the source of negentropy is the influence of solar radiation on molecular structures. The systems approach to the study of Ufe requires analyses of the correla tions between structure and function. These notions are carefully studied by Soviet philosophers in conjunction with the notions of 'form' and 'content' and in the context of the general laws of the dialectic. More about this below. For the moment, V. I. Sviderskij shows how the notions of structure and organization have come to the fore of the Soviet stage in defining Ufe: " . .. while Engels in his famous definition of Ufe .. . stressed the reproduction of the elements of the living substance, today our notions of life accentuate .. . structure and its role as a trait of vital processes".24 Thus, the usual efforts at widening Engels' definition of life have to do with its material substrate and its structure. L. A. Ermolova says: "How ever, the definition of the notion of 'Ufe' has to meet the requirements of</page><page sequence="10">190 NAFTALI PRAT dialectical logic. Therefore, it w?l not differ in kind from that of Engels, but w?l have a richer content." 2S Other efforts have tried to take account of the possib?ity of extra-terrestial Ufe-forms. Such is the Une of thought of A. N. Kolmogorov,26 and of N. P. Dubinin: Since the famous formula of Engels 'life is the mode of existence of protein bodies' genetic biochemistry, following the paths of materialism, has enriched and widened our understanding of the phenomena of life. Life on earth is the integrated existence of DNA, RNA and proteins in the form of individualized, personal and specific, whole structural biochemical, open systems with the properties of self-organization and reproduction through historically developing forms of genetic information. The structural-biochemical level of vital organization could be quite different, like viruses at the limits of organic and inorganic. Such discoveries would bring serious changes to biology and to the notion of life. It is time to study the most important methodological principles of the unity of discreteness and integrity in the structural-systemic bases of life as the highest form of the motion of matter.27 This definition is very good and exhaustive. However, it is tied to the state of the art in biology today and therefore cannot serve as a ph?osophic definition of Ufe. This is why there arose among some Soviet philosophers of biology the notion of providing a definition of Ufe that did not include the material substrate and that would be, therefore, purely functional. This idea arose principaUy among cyberneticists in their efforts to apply cybernetics to biological systems. S. L. Sobolev and A. A. Ljapunov note: Theoretical biology must precisely define the object, i.e. life, vital activity, animal, etc. Cybernetics can help. For example, the living being can be defined as a macroscopic body, reacting to external activity in an expedient way. It attempts to preserve the stability of the body as such.28 Developing this notion, these authors assert that the self-preservation of the Uving body is a matter of a control-system which uses information that is codified in the structure of each molecule. This effort at functional definition met with the opposition of more orthodox ph?osophers. The possib?ity of non-protein forms of Ufe was met with G. Wald's statement that "not only the chemical elements, but also the chemical constitution of organisms, seems to be constant over the Universe".29 Not without some justification, the critics point out that the extension of the functional definition eventuaUy wipes out the distinction between living and non-Uving. As A. N. Kolmogorov puts it:</page><page sequence="11">DIAMAT AND CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGY 191 The modelling of the organizational form of a material system can consist in nothing less that the construction out of the other material elements of a new system, having the same basic traits as the modelled system. Therefore, a full model of a living being would have to be a Uving being and the model of a thinking being, a thinking being.30 Kolmogorov's opponents respond to him that by definition the model cannot be converted with the object modeUed; otherwise, the model would lose aU heuristic value. M. M. Kamsilov says: Kolmogorov cannot imagine the problems that such a formulation of the question poses for biologists. For, in order to be alive, the model would have to be included in the biotic cycle, independent of man. This would seem possible only if it were constructed of the same elements as other life-forms. In other words, the modelling of life would come down to synthesizing life. Although science has not yet done this, there is no reason to call it impossible. But, in order that the model be independent of the biotic cycle, it would have to model not just the living organism but the whole complex system of Ufe; and the whole evolutionary process! It is very doubtful that such a modelling could be done with 'other material elements'.31 In brief, such an approach would exclude diamat's basic principle of 'his toricism'. Since the efforts of A. I. Oparin are rather weU-known (cf. G. Wetter32), we may limit ourselves to essentials. Oparin's theory of the origination of Ufe in coacervates was accepted by those (A. S. Konikova, M. G. Kricman, etc.) who saw coacervates simply as structures which are complex when compared to the primitive forms of Ufe, e.g. viruses. In this sense, their view is close to those who hold for a 'vital molecule'. One of the major objections to Oparin's theory came from those who saw it postulating natural selection, i.e., a biological law, at the pre-biological level. To circumvent such objections, the proponents of diamat often propose the even murkier suggestion that this trait is lodged in the more fundamental characteristic of reflection, defined as the ab?ity adequately to change in response to activity. To understand the nature and origins of life, one has profoundly to penetrate the Lenin ist notion of reflection. As a matter of fact, the living being is a special system with a quahtatively new interaction with the environment. The difficulty disappears when one takes reflection as an internal structure of things and objects . . . and selection of co acervates turns out to be natural selection at the level of adequate reflection of external influences.33 It seems clear that this invocation of 'reflection' is an instance of the</page><page sequence="12">192 NAFTALI PRAT 'general methodological' function of diamat and shows that neither is the problem is solved nor is the cause of science advanced. These efforts to define Ufe in terms of 'substrate' or 'function' have led Soviet biologists to what Frolov caUs 'biological substantiaUsm' and 'biological functionaUsm' and have left them with only the definition of Ufe provided by science. Noting that the notion of motion cannot be confined to a single body, Frolov quotes the American biochemist, H. H. Pattee to the effect that Ufe is a quaUty inherent in the ecosystem as a whole ? a view similar to that of M. M. Kamsllov with his 'biotic cycle'. Frolov is pleased to see here a 'dialectical' overcoming of the difficulties in defining life. His opponents are not too sure about this. The proponents of diamat see proof of contemporary science's dialectical character in the recognition by aU of the "quaUtative specificity of the biological forms of motion". For example, V. A. Engel'gardt writes: Of signal methodological importance for contemporary science is the definition of Ufe established by diamat, according to which life is a special form of the existence of matter, higher than the merely physical and chemical.34 A sim?ar 'definition' is found in FE and BSE (latest edition). Despite aU the paucity of information in these definitions of Ufe from the diamat perspective, one can isolate several key ideas which mark the Soviet ph?osophical approach to the problem of Ufe: mainly, the idea of the material unity of the world; the recognition of Ufe as a 'form of existence of matter'; and rejection of any non-material factor. What is more, such definitions recognize a 'hierarchy', a higher and lower, in the world. This last idea is decisive for an understanding of how diamat has moved ever closer to the position of contemporary science. What we are saying is this. The categories, laws, etc. of diamat have over time been tainted by the systems-structural approach to such an extent that little or no ph?osophical content remains. The so-caUed 'definition' of life is a case in point. It is purely negative - anti vitaUstic and anti-mechanistic. As soon as one asks for something positive, there is only the famous 'higher form';and, when one asks what this is, diamat leaves the ph?osophic arena and makes constant appeal to empirical science. This inab?ity of diamat to give a philosophic answer to a philosophic question points beyond biology to the general diamat refusal to recognize the phi losophy of nature that is there. How much richer is Lossky's statement:</page><page sequence="13">DIAMAT AND CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGY 193 By Ufe I mean 'being-for-selF in centripetal activity. 'Being-for-self means that the agent does not simply exist but it exists for-it, it experiences itself consciously or un consciously as something of positive or negative value, i.e. as good or evil. Every materialism is some sort of ontologization of the data of empirical science. This is true of diamat, where the effort to free ph?osophic language - 'Ufe', 'matter', 'motion', etc. ? from the errors of the past has created an emptiness of conception that aUows for no positive characterization of the basic notions that would make up a dialectical-materiahst ph?osophy. THE SYSTEMS-STRUCTURAL APPROACH As distinct from the old 'mechanistic' materiaUsm, diamat wants to be an 'organic' world-view, encompassing the whole world. At the same time, it wants to interpret this wholeness purely materially, and denies the presence in the world of anything supra-temporal or non-spatial. Every event is marked, for diamat, by space and time. The wholeness that diamat has in mind appears in the material interaction of objects. The notion of material interaction which lies at the basis of the systems-structural approach is very important in contemporary biology. This leads Soviet authors to claim that the 'dialec tification' of biology is a consequence of the very development of that science as such. A.Ja.fl'in writes: Overcoming in the course of its development the speculative constrictions of the holists, the 'emergent evolutionists', the organicists, etc., science has assimilated the idea that the emergence of a new quality cannot be due to some immaterial factors, but must result from the activity of natural and knowable laws. Consequently, the new level of organization has specific laws which cannot be reduced to those of the lower level. This qualitative specificity must be seen as a result of the law-bound complexification of the interaction of 'simple' elements, forming the system's new level of complexity.36 Diamat warns biologists away from both mechanicism and vitaUsm toward the 'general line' of systems study. The doctrine on the 'forms of the motion of matter' gives characteristic expression to diamat's idea on the hierarchical construction of the world. Different 'forms of the motion of matter' are distinguished by their specific organization. The idea of organization arose long before the introduction into biology of cybernetics and information theory. Information and organization are related notions and, for diamat, the relationship is sealed by the material unity of the world. AU organization is organization of material objects within</page><page sequence="14">194 NAFTALI PRAT one material world. Every level of organization has its own systems-structural specificity. As A.Ja. fl'inputsit: The developing conception of organization and its levels in biology, is nothing more than the penetration of diamat's methodology into research on Uving processes. Its premiss is the development of a series of philosophic ideas, like material interaction and the for mation of a new quality (a new level) as a result of the quantitative complexification of the originary elements.37 Thus, of the three 'laws of the dialectic' it is the law of 'transition from quantity to quality' that plays the salient role in Soviet biology. It is this law which forms the 'general Une' and which makes it possible to avoid both mechanicism and vitaUsm. This law is criticized by 'bourgeois philosophers' who see diamat's 'dialectical leap' as breaking the cause-effect relation and robbing the new quality of its ground in the material processes. When con temporary Soviet diamat?iki talk about quaUty they have in mind not Locke but Hegel, i.e., quality is what makes a thing what it is. But diamat takes this HegeUan notion out of the realm of the self-development of Spirit into that of 'self-movement of matter'. And, this is where structuraUst notions appeal to diamat. The dialectical leap, whereby a new quaUty comes to be, is inter preted as the origination of a new systems-structural link between material objects. Quality acquires quantitative measure and the leap can be experimen taUy examined. P. K. Anoxin, who is active in overcoming the mechanicism of orthodox Pavlovians, writes: Quality as a category defining the leap-like transition in the motion of matter remains a philosophic category. But, we are entering an era in the development of science when quality will have to be conceived within the parameters of the exact, mathematical and physical sciences.38 Since the exact sciences operate with quantitative criteria, aU this can mean is the expression of quality in quantitative terms which amounts to the reduction of quaUty to quantity. Such a trend may fit modern science but it is contrary to some basis tenets of diamat (at least in its orthodox form), including its rejection of mechanicism for just such a reduction. In 'The Transition of Quantitative Changes into Qualitative' in the F.E. V. S. Tjuxtin proposes a systems-structural understanding of quaUty, using the HegeUan idea of measure as the mediation of quality and quantity. Measure can mediate because it is both static and dynamic. Measure in the</page><page sequence="15">DIAMAT AND CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGY 195 static sense "is the correspondence of systems of regular relations, expressible in mathematical terms, of certain quaUties".39 It characterizes the structure of the thing. The dynamic moment in the definition of measure is the forma tion of a quality, the transition from old quaUty to new. From this viewpoint "the measure of things is that interval of quantitative changes of their prop erties (parameters) within which there is preservation of the things, their quaUties and their structure".40 Tjuxtingoeson: This notion of measure grounds the systems-structural approach to the understanding of quality. The qualitative determinacy of things is expressed in their dynamic (or static) structure which, in turn, is expressed via a system of laws. The most adequate under standing of the structure is attained when it can be expressed mathematically.41 The transition to a new quaUty appears, then, as the transition from a system of one degree of stability and organization to another; it includes the reconstruction of the links between components (and sub-system) of the system, as well as changes in the disposition of the elements of the system. The new quality, which marks the new system, has a new measure and new possibilities of quanti tative change.42 The "law of transition of quantitative changes into quaUtative" is connected with the "law of unity and struggle of opposites" through the notion that the inner content of the former law is the interaction of polar forces, processes and tendencies toward change. When the interaction of opposing forces reaches a limit, there is a rupture in the stab?ity of the system and recon struction of it into something 'quaUtatively new'. Tjuxtin asserts that the character of the interaction of the opposing forces depends on changes in external and internal conditions, since "external conditions influence this interaction in function of the degree of stability and relative independence (isolation) of the concrete system".43 QuaUtative changes of Uving organisms in response to changes in their conditions of existence are an example of this. In the organic realm (and in nature, too) the notion of quality includes not only physical magnitudes but also characteristics that are bound up with the notions of reflection, transmission and elaboration of information. It is this that sets leaps in Uving nature off from those in inorganic nature. Those who are famiUar with the history of Soviet ph?osophy w?l see that this 'last word' in the form of 'systems-structural' diamat goes back in reality to certain ideas of A. A. Bogdanov and N. I. Bukharin. Their theory of</page><page sequence="16">196 NAFTALI PRAT 'equiUbrium' as heart of the dialectic was long ago condemned as an anti Marxist heresy. Already in 1929, the Second AU-Union Conference of Marxist-Leninist Institutions resolved that mechanicism, leading a fight against the philosophy of Marxism-Leninism, not under standing the principles of the materialist dialectic, and subjecting it in fact to vulgar evolutionism, as well as positivist materialism, objectively prevents inserting the method ology of diamat into science, etc. - both represent clear departures from the Marxist Leninist philosophic position.44 This resolve was never formaUy taken and it is interesting to note that the ideas of Bogdanov are enjoying a renaissance in the Soviet Union. The current Soviet systems-structural approach uses the same notion of organization that Bogdanov had. In his Philosophy of Living Experience, Bogdanov critiques the dialectical ideas of Engels (and, by implication, those of Marx) and reinterprets the Hegelian idea as the rupture of an initial stability leading to the establishment of a new dynamic balance. Bogdanov writes: Losing from view this vital and real meaning of the dialectic, Engels and Marx lost the possibility of explaining the transition from quantity to quality. After our research, such an explanation becomes very simple. If a given process - the motion of a body, the life of an organism, the development of society - is defined by the conflict of two opposing forces, then as long as one prevails quantitatively ? even by only a little ? the process goes to that direction. As soon as the other force, growing, is equal to the first, the whole character of the process - its 'quality' ? changes; either it ceases or, going further, it overcomes the second force, reversing the direction; in either case, our senses tell us that there is before us something 'qualitatively' other.45 Many Soviet authors (M. I. Setrov, I. V. Blauberg, V. N. Sadovskij E. G. Judin and others) are pointing out how close Bogdanov's ideas are to con temporary systems theory. However, these positive evaluations of Bogdanov's 'tektology' (with the necessary 'corrections') are tempered by the reaUzation that as Bogdanov was developing these ideas, he was rejecting philosophy as useless. However, the idea of a 'universal organizational science' is reaUy bound up with the revision of the dialectic (in Engels' version) which we find in Bogdanov's earUer works. Thus, at the very outset, Bogdanov defines dialectic as the "organizational process, taking the path of the conflict of opposing tendencies".46 He specificaUy notes that this notion of the dialectic does not fuUy agree with that of Marx who speaks of 'development' instead of</page><page sequence="17">DIAMAT AND CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGY 197 organizational process. Contemporary proponents of diamat do not find this distinction important. In the above passage, Tjuxtin sees development as a special case of organizational process. Bogdanov writes that the dialectical schema worked very weU in the description of processes of living nature but that it applied only with qualifications to inorganic nature. The standard reproach against the 'mechanists' in the Soviet Union was that they denied the quaUtative specificity of the 'higher forms of the motion of matter' and reduced the whole to the sum of its parts. It is hard to see who could have held such a primitive reductionism; in any case, it cannot apply to Bogdanov. The real pioneer in the 'systems' interpretation of the Marxist dialectic in the Soviet Union was N.I. Bukharin who took from Bogdanov the 'theory of equiUbrium' without taking any of his 'empirio-monism'. Bukharin remained a convinced materiaUst, although he thought that the 'mystical' language of the HegeUan dialectic had to be replaced by that of contemporary mechanics. Marxist opposition to mechanicism was due, according to Bukharin, to old misconceptions about the atom as indivisible. Modern science could overcome the misgivings. Basic to Bukharin's ph?osophic outlook is the notion of interaction between the system and the environment: Any object ? a stone, a living being, human society, etc. - can be taken as a whole, made up of parts (elements), connected one with the other. In other words, this whole can be seen as a system. And no system exists in a vacuum; it is surrounded by other natural objects which, relative to it, can be called the environment.*1 According to Bukharin, following Bogdanov, "... the internal (structural) equilibrium is a magnitude which depends on the external equilibrium (is a 'function' of this external equilibrium^.^ This position was resolutely criticized in the Soviet Union since it seemed to revise the diamat notion that the source of motion is to be found in the internal contradictions in aU things. However, the counterposing of 'internal' and 'external' contradictions assumes a philosophic position that contradicts the 'system' interpretation of diamat and that is in essence incompatible with materiaUsm.49 When contemporary proponents of diamat deal with real 'contradictions' (in the form of antago nism) in nature and society, they in fact ignore the HegeUan opposition of 'internal' and 'external'. In the ph?osophic interpretation of biology the thesis on the primacy of</page><page sequence="18">198 NAFTALI PRAT internal contradictions over external ones is used by the defenders of scientific genetics against the mediano-Lamarckian affirmation of the decisive role of external conditions in determining the changes of organisms, including heredity. Only the introduction of cybernetic ideas into biology has shown the futility of the conflict between 'mechanicism' and 'vitalism' on the relative importance of 'external' and 'internal' contradictions. Particularly useful in this regard have been the contributions of 1.1. Schmalhausen who has shown - in his The Organism as a Whole in Individual and Historical Development, Factors of Evolution, and Cybernetic Questions in Biology ? that at various levels of biological organization the control function is due to different factors, external as weU as internal. However, if life is taken as a whole system, as a 'biotic cycle', then the whole environment has to be taken as the control factor. Returning to Bukharin's views on the systems character of objects in nature and society, one has to stress that his reductionism is in no way 'mechanistic'. Defining society as a 'real aggregate' ? in contrast to the reactionary 'organic' theories of society - Bukharin stressed that society is not a simple aggregate of individuals, i.e., their arithmetic sum. Society is a very complex system of interactions among differing individuals ? interactions which differ in quantity and quaUty. "This means", says Bukharin, that society as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It can never be reduced to these parts; and this is true of all systems, whether they be living organisms or dead mechanisms.50 We thus can see that the basic outUnes of a 'systems' interpretation of diamat were clearly formulated by Bukharin already in the 1920s. Con temporary proponents of 'systems' diamat do not see how they are repeating the positions of the 'mechanicists' of the 1920s and, what is more, try to make their own the accusations that the Deborinites were making against the mechanicists. In defending himself against these, one of the leading 'mechanicists' I. Stepanov once wrote: The Deborinites devote all their forces to obscuring this elementary question (on the essence of life, N.P.). For example, verbally they differ with the vitalists; factually, they are allied with them by forgetting the fact that there have always been, are now and always will be only two basic tendencies in biology - the idealist, called vitalism, denying the reducibility of vital phenomena to physical-chemical processes, and the materialist, affirming this reducibility and simultaneously demonstrating it brilliantly in practice, through experiment. One should not forget to add that this unique materialist trend in</page><page sequence="19">DIAMAT AND CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGY 199 biology has always been called mechanistic and the Deborinites well know it. They cannot but recognize that a fight against it is a fight against the application of materiaUst views in biology. This does not bother them. They are completely allied with the vitalists since they repeat all. . . that the vitalists say ... ,51 'Mechanicists' do not deny the appearance of new 'qualities' in the process of the development of nature. They only insist on the relative character of the 'break in continuity' and on the "continuous process of transformation of the general movement of nature from one form to another", which makes it possible "to reduce very complex forms of motion, observed in the organism, to relatively simple forms that we observe in physics and chemistry".52 Today's proponents of 'systems' diamat verbally disagree with the 'me chanicists' but in fact repeat the latters' basic theses. Otherwise, they would not dogmaticaUy assert the material unity of the world, wh?e reducing the different levels of organization of nature to the progressive complexification of material substance, arising as the result of a regular evolution, directed only by the laws of the motion of dead matter. Every materialism is me chanistic. Denial of this is possible only with the help of a very narrow and limited notion of 'mechanicism' ? a notion so narrow that few 'mechanicists' would agree with it. The dominant trend in Soviet ph?osophy of biology could be caUed 'neo-mechanicism' in order to stress both its distance from caricatural mechanicism which seems to exist only in the textbooks of its opponents, and what it has in common with aU forms of mechanicism in philosophy, namely 'naturaUsm'. Diamat denies the 'reducib?ity' of the higher to the lower and simultane ously asserts that to induce' the higher from the lower is not only possible but even necessary since in the process of evolution the higher arises from the lower. This means that mechanicism from the diamat viewpoint is the assertion that because the higher forms of motion arise from the lower and the lower, therefore, are contained in the higher, there is nothing basicaUy new in these higher forms and the essence of the higher is fuUy exhausted by the lower. Such a definition of mechanicism is based on a sophistry. 'New' can mean several different things, including a new combination of already existing elements (new organization), as well as a 'substantiaUy' and qualitatively 'new'. It is the first meaning that occurs in diamat. Although the law of causaUty is not violated, neither do we go beyond the Umits of mechanicism in a very definite meaning of the term. The new properties of the system which are not present in its elements before the constitution of</page><page sequence="20">200 NAFTALI PRAT the system, foUow from the properties of the elements and this means in the final analysis that new properties are reducible to the old ones because 'deduce', 'induce' and 'reduce' come together here. The existence of specific biological laws by no means contradicts presentation of these laws as the result of the chemical and physical interactions. Soviet ph?osophy of biology is a variant of naturaUsm which is very close to the views of some Western ph?osophers of science, although this fact is masked by their pseudo-HegeUan terminology. This terminology is used to describe processes that can be better described in systems-structural terms. In his time, Bogdanov saw the major mistake of diamat to be "that it does not explain or clarify the dialectic. And, were it to do so, it would cease to be itself and become another type of understanding of the world."53 According to Bogdanov, the 'organizational' understanding of the dialectic makes it clear that the dialectic is not at aU something universal and that it cannot be a general method of knowledge. It is a partial case of organized processes, which can be reached in other ways".54 However, Soviet ph?osophers try every which way to preserve the tradi tional dialectical terminology with the help of its very practical interpretation. As we said above, the most important of the three 'laws of the dialectic' for biology is the law of the "transition from quantity to quality", simultaneous ly anti-vitalist and anti-mechanicist. Contemporary theoreticians of diamat interpret this law systems-structuraUy. However, the very formulation of this 'law' essentiaUy excludes such an interpretation. B. V. Vyseslavcev has very pertinently demonstrated the imperfection of this formulation precisely in relation to the question of the origin of life: No increase or diminution of quantity of atoms can in itself provide a living cell. We can agree that so many atoms and molecules make a living cell, but this does not provide any experiment for establishment of a Uving ceU only out of a certain quantity of atoms. The essential is obviously not the quantity buta certain combination of molecules and motion, which remains unknown and which is undecidable in physical-chemical categories.55 What Vyseslavcev caUs a 'certain combination' of atoms is the structure, i.e. what the FE defines as the "distribution and internal organizational form of a system, appearing as a unity of structured interrelations among its elements".56 The notion of structure is central to the systems approach, although it cannot replace the categories and laws of diamat. It threatens them. It is noteworthy that in the 1960s when this notion drew the attention</page><page sequence="21">DIAMAT AND CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGY 201 of Soviet ph?osophers, they took a long time finding out where it belonged: to 'quaUty' or to 'quantity'. Even today such notions as 'structure', 'system', 'element', 'function', etc. are not as univocaUy defined as most terms in the dogmatic structure of diamat. A relevant example of how the proponents of diamat have been forced to rethink the law of "transition from quantity to quaUty" under the influence of recent scientific advances is N. P. Dubinin's reflection on the method ological aspects of the application of this law in genetics. The transition from quantitative changes to quaUtative ones at the molecular level in the Uving system imparts a special character to the basic forms of appearance of new quaUties in the development of the genetic code. There remains the question of the specific weight and import of these phenomena when the quantitative changes are included in the very process of qualitative reconstruction of the system. In such cases the process of fundamental qualitative change is not preceded by gradual quantitative changes. The establishment or loss of a nucleotide is a typically quantitative change which, however, is itself included in the processes leading to mutation and to the ap pearance of a new way of encoding information in the gene.57 In other words, lacking here is the gradual accumulation of quantitative changes, leading to a quaUtative leap only on reaching a certain Umit; lacking also is the notion of measure as a unity of quantity and quality. In fact, there is no transition from quantitative changes to quaUtative ones since quality and quantity are simply different traits of the same process. According to Dubinin, inclusion of the elementary quantitative changes in the qualitative transformation of the gene is conditioned by the fact that the gene appears as a hoUstic system. This means that the establishment or loss of a nucleotide is a structural change which is neither quantitative nor quaUtative in the traditional meaning of these terms. What remains of the HegeUan formulation after such an operation is hard to say. One could ask if it would not be better to dispense altogether with this archaic formula which has doubtful heuristic significance. One representative of American 'scientific naturaUsm', E. Nagel, whose general ph?osophic position is quite close to that being graduaUy taken by diamat under the influence of contemporary science, is very sceptical about assertions that the methods and conclusions of science fit into triad of 'dialectical principles', fam?iar to many foUowers of Hegel and Marx: Space is lacking to examine these and other claims for the virtues of dialectic laws. It must suffice to recaU Einstein's remark that philosophers are fortunate indeed in being</page><page sequence="22">202 NAFTALI PRAT always able to estabUsh the agreement of the latest finding of science with their own metaphysical principles. The principles of dialectic can be guaranteed never to fail, because their terms have no fixed content; they can be stretched to cover any facts whatsoever, after the facts have been independently established. Were it not for the mysterious profundity claimed for them, and did they not serve to check inquiry by the gUb finahty with which they resolve aU problems, the laws of dialectic could be left unreproached as a curious verbal game. As instruments for disentangling the web of theoretical constructions, however, they are as barren as the purest of vestal virgins.58 Apart from their penchant for dialectical formulations, there is little to distinguish the writings of Soviet authors from those of Western authors on the ph?osophic foundations of biology. What is currently caUed 'dialectical materiaUsm' in science turns out to be a non-reductionist reaUsm, a species of naturalism, scientism and neo-mechanicism with little to distinguish it from what is going on in the West. INTEGRITY AND EXPEDIENCY The idea that integrity (or wholeness) is a mark of the Uving being predates the appearance of scientific biology. It was clearly formulated in ancient ph?osophy. Expediency (or 'goal-orientedness') is indissolubly tied up with the notion of integrity. The living organism is marked on the one hand by the ab?ity to remain itself wh?e the environment changes, and on the other to adapt itself to changes in the environment. Emphasis on one side or the other has marked the history of biology and the conflict between vitalism and mechanicism. However, there are no strict vitaUsts or pure mechanicists left today. There is only the difference of opinion on how much stress to give to integrity and how much to expediency, with no one denying that both are necessary. H. Driesch, the founder of neo-vitaUsm, insisted on attributing entelechy to the organism because ? as distinct from a machine ? it could not be reduced to the sum of its parts. The opponents of vitalism responded by showing that Driesch's argument is faulty; for, in any system (including a machine) the whole is more than the sum of the parts. Both Bogdanov and Bukharin had indicated this and cybernetics has given it exact mathematical expression. Contemporary diamat devotes a lot of attention to the categories of part and whole. Moreover, they are not satisfied with indicating what is common to aU wholes, but insist that biological integrity is something special. Already</page><page sequence="23">DIAMAT AND CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGY 203 Engels had said that part and whole were inadequate categories for organic nature.59 Soviet researchers stress that the appearance of new forms of the motion of matter is the appearance of a new type of integrity. The basic material for the integrity of a new type comes from the highest form of the previous whole. In the formation of the new whole, such a highest form loses its independence and becomes part of the new whole. However, inclusion of parts in a whole transforms the properties of the parts themselves. Speaking of part and whole in the FE, I. Blauberg mentions 'antinomial wholes', the overcoming of which requires a synthetic approach with envelop ment of the whole along with its various relationships. For him, this is the diamat approach. The irreducibiUty of the whole to the sum of its parts is only one aspect of the problem; the "whole is greater than the sum of the parts" is also logicaUy vulnerable since it refers only to the quantitative aspect and presents the whole as a sort of remainder from the enumeration of the parts. According to Blauberg, "The solution to the problem is to say that the whole has new traits and properties, not present in the parts and resulting from the interaction of these parts".60 The question on the primacy of part over whole or vice versa has no meaning in diamat since in a whole its parts have properties specific to that whole and "a whole without (any) parts is uninteUigible, since an absolutely simple and structureless body can have, even in thought, no properties and no interaction with other bodies".61 Diamat distinguishes among wholes 'organic wholes' which "are so related that the aggregate moves toward self-development, complexification and differentation".62 Biological objects (and social ones, as weU) are examples of such 'organic wholes'. Among the parts of an organic whole are found not just functional relations but a complex of Unks, where cause and effect reciprocaUy condition one another. Instead of linear causaUty, one finds a sort of closed circle of causes and effects. There are in the organic whole relations of subordination and of coordination. Diamat claims that the "hoUstic (structural) approach is not opposed to causal explanation, but merely shows the insufficiency of linear causaUty for the analysis of complex systems".63 Related in this way, the integrity and expediency of the organic whole appear in the activity of the Uving organism, the conduct of which cannot be reduced to reactivity, i.e. univoca! dependence on external stimuli. N. A.</page><page sequence="24">204 NAFTALI PRAT BernStejn has developed the notion of a 'physiology of activity', according to which the behavior of an organism is determined by an internal program, enabling it to go beyond mere balance with the environment and 'negen tropicaUy' to overcome it. The Uving system is marked by two main traits: conservation of its identity with itself and a constant tendency outwards. Its behavior is expedient, i.e. marked by a goal or 'model of the needed future', which is not fixed but dependent on selection of the most expedient means under the circumstances. The 'physiology of activity' opposes the trial and error of behaviorism with its hierarchy of control-systems, the highest of which is the 'model of the needed future'. Instead of the old notions of 'reflex arc' and 'equiUbrium of organism and environment', the 'physiology of activity' sees organic activity according to the principle of 'reflex ring', i.e. a continuous cycle of interaction with the environment. Input for the act leads to neural activity which accompanies every phase of behavior. In contrast to the old view, where the reflex arc begins with input, one can begin here at any point on the ring. Adaptive behavior is programmed into a specific model which forms in the cortex as an apparatus which perceives and 'evaluates' the results. P. K. Anoxin caUs this apparatus the 'receiver of the results of activity'. The Uving organism carries out an active search in the environment. Signals on the results of this search in the form of 'reflex input' enter the organism and are compared with the existing parameters of the 'receiver of activity'. If there is no correspondence, the search goes on. The adaptive activity of the organism has an intentional character. But, it is conditioned by a program of exceptional richness. Diamat treats integrity and expediency as very important notions but succeeds in emptying them of any content and making them tokens for a very complex mechanism and determinism. The integrity about which diamat speaks is the wholeness of a system, i.e. the complex interaction of spatiaUy contiguous elements. Diamat's expediency contains no genuine teleology; it is merely one instance of causaUty in Uving beings. The theoreticians of diamat love to cite Timirjazev, when he says that Darwinism estabUshed a 'new and radical teleology'. Preserving the old word ? expediency - we give it a new meaning. These perfected organs and whole organism were not estabUshed in view or in expectation of use, but use itself estabUshed them. Instead of the proposed goal, we have the actual cause.64</page><page sequence="25">DIAMAT AND CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGY 205 A cybernetic understanding of teleological processes in nature makes it possible to widen and deepen the notion of 'new and radical teleology' which Darwinism established. Cybernetics makes it possible to model the active adaptation of the Uving organism, along with its structural and functional changes. Frolov writes: Cybernetics demonstrated the possibility of the existence of such models in nature, giving new direction to the study of the problem of goals and teleology along a general diamat and anti-teleological track. Where ideaUsm see 'final cause' and 'rational goal', cybernetics sees material causal relations. Thereby it preserves and renders rational the objective meaning of the teleological relations in nature, and carries on the work of Darwin by studying the material causes of these relations.65 Cybernetics uses language with a clear teleological taint and this dissatisfies Soviet ph?osophers who quite rightly point out that one has here not con scious intentions but their analogues which are material in nature. Frolov writes that cybernetics does not introduce the notion of goal into biology and does not give it Umitless appUcation, freed of anthropomorphism; but only finds the material analogues of goals in the objective characteristics of self-regulating systems, designating them in terms of information and feedback. Would it be useful to translate these semanticaUy invariant goals into the bases for analogy? Is it not better to conserve the term 'goal' merely in its direct and specific meaning, related to cognized, ideal representation of the end of activity, retaining a conditional appUcation of this term for describing natural processes with conditions similar to those of organic expediency? ^ Frolov is not worried about teleologism and finaUsm, as these are 'myths at the cybernetic level'. For some time, diamat has been attacking 'physiological', 'physical', 'bio logical' and other forms of 'ideaUsm'. Now it seems that there is 'cybernetic ideaUsm' which has to be overcome ? following the time-honored Leninist recipe ? by winning the scientists over to diamat's view on causaUty. Frolov refers to the statements of E. Mayr and C. H. Waddington who introduce the terms 'teleonomy' and 'quasi-teleology' as alternatives to the teleological and finalistic interpretations of causality (it is not out of place to note that Waddington has evidenced sympathy for diamat). According to Frolov, these terms describe causal relations in the language of cybernetics with the help of the program and feedback, i.e. cycUcal, reversible causality, including predetermination of the results of activity and, consequently, directiona?ty of the last.</page><page sequence="26">206 NAFTALI PRAT Frolov has some difficulties with these terms but he appreciates the effort to get away from teleology while retaining the abiUty to research complex systems with the help of the notion of expediency. Use of the notions of goal and expediency as heuristic devices for the study of objects without these traits causes no problems for Frolov. He sees the 'goal-oriented approach' as part of the general functional analysis of complex systems. Reference to the final stage in a process as to its goal, i.e. the functional-final or frankly goal-oriented approach, can happen without regard to the meaning we give the notion of goal since it appears only as a regulative principle. It can reflect a real phenomenon (as in the analysis of human activity) or it can represent a trend (between initial and final) in a process in the form of a material or ideal model, as a theoretical construct, etc.67 Thus, diamat asserts that in Uving nature integrity and expediency are only apparent. And diamat is not alone in this opinion, for it is widespread among contemporary biologists. What distinguishes the Soviet ph?osophers is only their dialectical terminology which is ? as we have seen ? different in meaning from the earUer stages. The contemporary biologist's picture of the world does not contain any signs of the interference of higher powers. Life inaU its various manifestations is seen as the result of the activity of blind, organic forces. It is a cheerless picture. Some doubts are permitted as to the tenab?ity of these views. Is it true that a whole can be presented in categories of the systems approach? Every material system is a certain set of spatiaUy, contiguous elements, among which exist various relations. As diamat rightly points out, the whole cannot be reduced to the sum of its parts and is not a set plus something added (a bond, a relation). The relation of the whole to its parts is a wholly specific relation of 'containment'. A wonderful analysis of this relation is to be found in S. L. Frank's Object of Knowledge.69 This relation is uninteUigible among absolutely isolated elements. The whole can be thought only as primary in reference to its parts, as a basic unity and reciprocal penetration of opposites. However, this basicaUy dialectical principle is incompatible with a materiaUstic treatment of any being as spatial temporal. The unity of the system requires a deeper and more substantial unity. As N. O. Lossky quite correctly notes, "where there is system, there is something supra-systemic".70 To conclude, we would like to point toward a path for overcoming natu raUsm in the ph?osophy of biology. It is the path of basic 'hoUsm', in contrast</page><page sequence="27">DIAMAT AND CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGY 207 to the 'quasi-hoUsm' of the systems approach. Biology cannot do without two fundamental principles which are not induced from the elementary laws of physics and chemistry and cannot be reduced to them: a structural principle and a principle of organizational field (an organizing principle).71 Diamat does not (and cannot) think through its own metaphysical pre suppositions. One introduces a systems-structural approach in terms of material interaction; but interaction is possible only where there is substantial unity. This unity, however, is seen by diamat as an attribute of matter, where there is nothing supra-temporal or extra-spatial. This is a basic weakness. Nothing we have said above should be taken as a recognition of vitalism in biology. We are not asking for a break with contemporary science but for a more careful examination of its metaphysical presuppositions. The words of S. Trubeckoj w?l make this position clear: The dispute between the mechanicists and ideaUsts can be laid to rest not by reference to specific and complex organic phenomena, but only via metaphysics, studying the general forms of phenomena as such and the forms of reaUty in general. Convinced that aU of reaUty is conditioned by logical categories, and held to the concrete idea of the being, the metaphysician does not apply his teleology arbitrarily from the outside; he would not be able to resist purely empirical explanations on the basis of physical causes. It is from the uniform and universal necessity of mechanical laws that he w?l infer the highest experimental proof for the universa?ty of the teleological principle - that logical principle which conditions the phenomena themselves.72 If we abstract from the little bit of Hegel in this, we can subscribe to it in full.
