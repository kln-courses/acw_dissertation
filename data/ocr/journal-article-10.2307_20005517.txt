NELSON Assistant Professor of Philosophy, Cornell University EVOLUTION AND THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN The old argument from design in Nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of Natural Selection has been discovered. CHARLES DARWIN1 Most commentators on the argument from design have agreed with Darwin's conclusion. But the reasons offered to explain why evolution has undermined the argument from design are usually sketchy and unsatisfactory. In this paper I will try to determine to what extent, if any, the argument from design has been weakened by recent scientific discoveries of the evolutionary mechan isms that produced our intricately ordered world. Thus I will begin by dis cussing the plausibility of the argument in the eighteenth century, before modern evolutionary theory, and then determine whether theism or natural ism is the most reasonable inference today. Finally I will consider the plausibility of alternatives to the traditional theistic position, such as deism and fideism. The argument from design begins by considering the very intricate order in the natural world, an ordered system being one whose parts are adapted to each other so that it functions as a unified whole. Thus empirical theists in the eighteenth century stressed the order in the solar system, in living organisms, and so on, one of their favourite examples being the extremely intricate human eye. This very complex instrument is similar to, and is even greatly superior to, the ordered systems such as watches and houses made by human intelligence. So the conclusion of the argument from design is that the order in nature likewise was probably made by an intelligent creator.2 Thus a simple version of the argument from design is: (i) The natural world displays intricate order (e.g. in the human body, in the solar system, and in life itself). (2) It is similar to, and even greatly exceeds in intricacy, the ordered artifacts that human intelligence can produce. 1 The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin (ed. F. Darwin, Appleton, 1893), vol. I, p. 278. 2 In this paper I am considering only the property of intelligence, rather than other properties such as goodness, power, and unity. Also, I am not considering arguments related to the argument from design, such as the teleological argument (cf. St Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae I, q. 2, art. 3), and the wider teleological argument (cf. F. R. Tennant, Philosophical Theology, Cambridge University Press, 1956, vol. ii, chap. iv). 15 RES 14</page><page sequence="2">424 KENNETH V. NELSON (3) So, by analogy, the natural world likewise was probably made by a very intelligent creator. An empirical argument like this can be criticized in two ways: on the basis of faulty logic or on the basis of incomplete evidence. The first kind, which is the kind mainly discussed by philosophers, claims that there are defects in the logic of the argument, e.g. Hume considers the objections that the analogy is weak, that there is no comparison for a unique universe, and that the logical conclusion should infer an extremely anthropomorphic creator. However, I think that the argument from design survives rather well these objections to its logic, as was generally realized by Hume. Although it is not my concern to argue it here, I think that there are no serious flaws in the logic of the eighteenth-century argument from design sketched above. Given only the evidence that there was extremely intricate order in the natural world, far exceeding the order that man could produce, it was reasonable to infer that the world's order probably arose from an intelligent cause. But even if we grant that the eighteenth-century argument from de sign was logically flawless, it does not follow that it is still reasonable today. For the argument still might be subject to the second kind of objection, viz., that there has been an addition to the empirical evidence in the last two centuries which alters what is the reasonable conclusion. My main concern in this paper is this kind of objection. According to this line of criticism, we have much more empirical evidence available today (in particular the scientific discoveries of the evolutionary mechanisms which produced the order); so even if the argument from design was reasonable in the eighteenth century, it is not reasonable today. To evaluate this objection, I will first discuss how the evidence has changed in the past two centuries, and then I will determine the effect of these changes upon the argument from design. The first change in the evidence relates to step (2). Its claim that the world's order greatly exceeds man-made order seemed correct in the eighteenth century. But in the past two centuries there has been an enormous increase in the sophistication of the artifacts that man can make. Today it is less clear that the order in nature greatly exceeds the intricacy in, say, man made computers. However, this change in the evidence is not crucial. Even if the order in nature no longer greatly exceeds man-made order, and thus could not be inferred to be due to a superintelligent creator, it still might reasonably be inferred to be the work of an intelligent creator. The main empirical evidence in the argument from design is that ex pressed in step (i), viz., the existence of the very intricate order in the natural world. The major change in the evidence has been the addition of knowledge of the evolutionary mechanisms through which the order was produced. It might be tempting to think that in the eighteenth century, and even earlier, they did know the evolutionary mechanisms. For, after all, in Part viii of the Dialogues Hume did present the evolutionary mechanism of Diderot and</page><page sequence="3">EVOLUTION AND THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN 425 d'Holbach, based on that of Epicurus, which is rather similar to the present view. They claimed that matter in motion will by chance form many con figurations; of these, the disordered, unstable ones will not be able to subsist, but the ordered systems naturally survive since order is a stable form, some thing able to subsist. However, it would be a mistake to think that they knew that the world evolved through such a mechanism. First of all, they were, of course, mistaken about the details of the process. For example, Hume points out, quite successfully I think, a defect in the natural selection mechanism of the Diderot-d'Holbach theory (which is not a defect of Darwin's natural selection mechanism). But secondly, even if the naturalists had got the details of the process right, it would have been just a lucky guess, i.e. just a possibility, mere speculation which later happened to be confirmed by the facts. In the eighteenth century the naturalists had basically no more empirical backing for their view that the world evolved over a very long time through these evolutionary mechanisms than the theist had for his view that the intricate world was created suddenly in seven days in 4004 B.C. In the eighteenth century both were mere possibilities, equally consistent with the known empirical facts (e.g. the main fossil evidence was not added until the early nineteenth century). Moreover, even in I859 when Darwin presented his evolutionary mechanism, he also recognized that it was only a possibility which was consistent with the data and fitted the data well. But he recognized that he had no empirical evidence of evolution in action (for he mistakenly thought that evolution was too slow to be observed in his life time). And as a result of this lack of evidence of evolution in action, Darwin's theory was in fact almost rejected in the early twentieth century (but such empirical evidence was added later, e.g. observations of the industrial melanism of moths, or the evolution of strains of bacteria resistant to penicillin). Moreover, the source of the variations in nature (viz., genetic mutation and recombination) was not known by Darwin, much less by the naturalists of the eighteenth century (not having been added to the theory until the I930s). Further, the argument from design is not based solely on the order in plants and animals, but also on order like that in the stars, in the planetary system, or in life itself. But the details of the evolutionary mechanisms which produced these ordered systems were not accepted as empirical facts until quite recently (even the basic parts of some were in doubt ten years ago). So I think that it is safe to say that in the eighteenth century these evolutionary mechanisms were mere possibilities, not known to be true. The empirical evidence was just not available to show that the world developed through these evolutionary mechanisms rather than, say, the mechanisms of instantaneous creation or some other evolutionary mechan ism. But since the eighteenth-century evolutionary mechanism was just a mere possibility, it should be excluded from the evidence. In empirical arguments I5--2</page><page sequence="4">426 KENNETH V. NELSON like the argument from design, mere possibilities do not matter. For example, when grading a well-written term paper, it would be incorrect for me to add the merely possible mechanism that it was the work of random typing over a long period of time, and hence infer a non-intelligent cause. Likewise in the eighteenth century all that could be judged is the effect, the ordered world, and any of these equally speculative mechanisms, whether they be evolutionary mechanisms or instantaneous creation mechanisms, should be omitted. But given only the effect, viz., a natural world with intricate order much better than man could produce, the most reasonable inference was the theistic one. It was conceivable that something as intricate and complex as the human eye arose from non-intelligent forces. But that was not the most reasonable conclusion to draw. The only other reasonable position in the eighteenth century would have been an agnostic, cautious position that man does not have the reasoning power or available evidence to decide the issue, which was Hume's view (although he wrongly emphasized our inferior reasoning powers rather than inferior evidence). So the eighteenth-century conclusion should have been either theism or agnosticism; but naturalism simply did not yet have the evidence to support it. In that period, and in earlier ones, the argument from design was accepted by many great thinkers. If I am correct, it is wrong to dismiss them as simply mistaken. However, today we know both the effects and the evolutionary mechanisms through which this order was produced. It is crucial to take the mechanisms into account when we evaluate the argument from design. What is the most reasonable inference given only the effect, can obviously be altered if we discover that it was produced by certain kinds of mechanisms. For example, suppose that I hear that you went golfing and shot a hole-in-one. Given only that evidence, it would be reasonable to infer that you are a skilful golfer. But suppose that I then discover that the mechanism through which you got it was that a nearby car backfired just as you were hitting the ball, so that you hit it far beyond the hole and far to the side of it, but the ball ricocheted off several rocks, trees, and startled onlookers, and eventually dropped into the hole. This additional evidence about your mechanism alters what is the most reasonable inference about your skill in getting the hole-in-one. Like wise the argument from design cannot be adequately evaluated today with out considering the evolutionary mechanisms through which the order was produced (although many philosophers try'). That would be as futile as my inferring your skill as a golfer solely from the effect, the hole-in-one, without bothering to consider the mechanism through which you got it. Further, when philosophers do consider the evolutionary mechanisms, they often consider only Darwin's mechanism for biological evolution. This is also a mistake. Darwin's mechanisms explain only the processes in the evolution of higher organisms. But this is only the very last stage in a very long process, 1 For example, Alvin Plantinga, God and Other Minds (Cornell University Press, I967), chap. 4.</page><page sequence="5">EVOLUTION AND THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN 427 and the intelligence of the cause might show up better at the earlier stages. Moreover, the argument from design is based upon other kinds of order not covered by Darwin's mechanisms, for example, the order in stars and in molecules of life. And perhaps the intelligence of the cause shows up only in the mechanisms producing this order. So I will give a brief sketch of the overall mechanisms generally agreed upon by scientists today as those pro ducing the world's order. Scientists trace the history of our ordered world back to a cataclysmic explosion approximately i8 billion years ago. Before that, unordered matter was gradually collapsing due to its own gravitational forces. This initial mixture of particles of matter and energy reached a state of maximum compression (a hundred trillion times denser than water) and a very high temperature (i o billion degrees) as it was squashed into a huge 'cosmic egg'. Then, according to the 'big bang' theory of Gamow (accepted in the I96os over Hoyle's steady-state theory), it exploded and the matter has been spreading out through space ever since.' The earliest ordered systems to form were stars, about a billion years after the big bang. Due to the initial explosion of matter, gas and dust clouds were widely dispersed. This dis persed matter was gradually pulled together by its own gravitational forces over a relatively rapid period of time (i to Io million years), and a stable star was formed when these gravitational forces inward were counterbalanced by radiation pressure outward (from high temperatures causing thermo nuclear conversions of hydrogen to helium).2 The various heavy elements were formed by thermonuclear reactions within stars. According to Hoyle's theory, at these very high pressures and temperatures (I5 million degrees and higher), nuclei will capture neutrons, which then decay (f-decay) into the more stable form of protons and electrons. The process by which our planetary system formed about 5 billion years ago was also evolutionary. According to this theory of von Weinzacker and Kuiper (accepted in the last few decades over the catastrophe theories of Chamberlin and Moulton), there was a residue from the sun's contraction which was mostly hydrogen. Its equilibrium state would be a flat rotating disc around the sun comprised of whirlpool-like zones of dispersed gas and dust which, over I5 to IOO million years, gradually contracted into planets through accretion and gravitational attraction.3 The next ordered system to form was life on Earth, through a chemical process of evolution taking a few billion years. Gases prevalent on the Earth (ammonia, methane, water vapour, and hydrogen) 1 Facts supporting this theory include that the farthest galaxies are moving away the fastest, evidence that quasars evolved, and mainly its prediction of the 30 background radiation and the initial percentage of helium, both of which were later confirmed. 2 Evidence that stars evolve in this way includes that we can now observe stars in different stages of their birth, life, and eventual death (when they burn out their available hydrogen). 3 Evidence for this theory includes observations of similar preplanetary nebulae around young stars.</page><page sequence="6">428 KENNETH V. NELSON reacted with the sun's strong ultraviolet rays to form amino acids. Then, in the seas, larger aggregates gradually formed, according to Oparin, through a natural selection process in which the different aggregates compete for surrounding material, and the slightly better adapted ones became domi nant.' After life appeared on Earth 2 to 3 billion years ago, it very gradually evolved into the higher organisms: first aquatic animals, then amphibians, then reptiles, and then, about IOO million years ago, the first mammals appeared, with early man appearing about 2 million years ago. The process, as described by Darwin and modern genetic theory, begins with the fact that in each generation members of the population tend to vary slightly from their parents and from other members of the population. These differ ences in heredity arise from random genetic recombinations and random genetic mutations (when the sequence of molecules of DNA comprising genes fails to copy itself exactly). Most of these genetic variations are non adaptive; but if one produces an individual only slightly better adapted than others to their environment, it will tend to flourish and have slightly more offspring, which means that over many generations it will gradually become the dominant type by natural selection.2 Although there are many details left to be explained in each of these processes, the above brief general summaries are accepted by most scientists today. All of these processes are evolutionary (although this was strongly questioned a few years ago): in each we find a gradual development from simple to complex, through first having an initial stage of variations being produced (e.g. different nuclear combinations, chemical aggregates, or biological variations). This is followed by a stage of competition (e.g. for surrounding neutrons, matter, chemicals, or food) during which there is a natural selection process: the more successful configurations flourish and the less successful ones gradually perish. Historians of the argument from design have pointed out that the scientific findings of evolution have been the major force in the demise of the argument from design.3 And most contemporary philosophers agree. However, the reasons usually given are rather weak. One of the most common claims is that scientific explanations simply replace religious ones. We need to invoke God only when there is a gap in the scientific explanation, but there are very few gaps left now. So given science, there is nothing left for religion to explain. I think that this is implausible. Simply saying that science has found the mechanism is not enough. It would be like saying that we now know the mechanism for your hole-in-one, and that is the end of the matter, without 1 We have evidence both that the basic chemical building blocks for life do occur naturally in the universe, e.g. as found in meteorites, and that they can react with ultraviolet light to produce the basics for life, as duplicated in laboratory experiments by Miller. 2 Evidence for biological evolution comes from comparative anatomy and fossil evidence, as well as examples of evolution in action. 3 For example, Robert Hurlbutt, Hume, Newton, and the Design Argument (University of Nebraska Press, I965), p. I80.</page><page sequence="7">EVOLUTION AND THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN 429 analysing the mechanism to see if it suggests skill or not. Likewise we need to analyse the precise details of the evolutionary mechanism to see if they suggest skill and intelligence, or simply non-intelligence. For example, suppose that science discovered the mechanism to be an almost instantaneous, mistake-free process creating the world with its complex and intricate species and planets suddenly out of nothing. Rather than simply precluding the theistic view, such a mechanism would support it. The scientific findings only provide further evidence to be analysed. Science just gives a neutral, factual description of the mechanism, for which both the theist and the naturalist give interpretations. The theistic interpretation is that an intelli gent creator must work through some mechanism or other, and this is it. The naturalistic interpretation is that the process is ultimately non-intelligent. So the scientific discovery of the mechanisms is not the end of the matter, but only the beginning. Two other reasons for thinking that evolution undermined the argument from design might briefly be mentioned. It is sometimes claimed that given Darwin's theory of evolution, there are now two possible explanations for the world's order: intelligence and non-intelligence. So then on the basis of the world's order alone, we cannot infer that the theistic explanation is the correct one. This is implausible. If it is correct it likewise entails that there is no way for the naturalist to infer that his explanation is the correct one either. Just because there are now two possible explanations that certainly does not show that we cannot infer that one is more reasonable than the other. The other claim sometimes made is that evolution undermined the argument from design because the naturalistic explanation is simpler than the theistic explanation. Naturalism can explain the world's order without positing an extra entity, God, and hence is preferable. This also is implausible. For example, suppose again that science did discover instead that our very intricately ordered world was produced instantaneously, in exactly its present form, without any mistakes, and so on. Here a theistic explanation would be more reasonable than the naturalistic one, even though the naturalistic explanation is 'simpler'. Thus these common reasons all seem unsuccessful, which might be expected since they are such general reasons. They do not analyse the details of the particular mechanisms science discovered, but that is crucial because, again, some particular mechanisms would suggest in telligence and others would not. So if evolution did undermine the argument from design, there must have been something about the particular mechan isms that science discovered that suggests non-intelligence, that is not brought out by any of the above reasons. It has seemed intuitive to most commentators on the argument from design that the findings of evolution did not strengthen the theistic side. But what is needed is some procedure to show this. In the eighteenth century, the argument from design proceeded by using arguments from analogy to</page><page sequence="8">430 KENNETH V. NELSON analyse the effect, the ordered world, to determine whether it is the effect of an intelligent cause. I want to suggest that arguments from analogy can also be used today to analyse the mechanisms which produced the effect, to determine whether they are the mechanisms of an intelligent cause. Perhaps the main reason for thinking that evolution undermined the argument from design is the one mentioned by Darwin in my opening quotation: an in telligent creator would not work through an evolutionary mechanism of variation and natural selection. I now want to consider analogues to show that this is mistaken. Suppose that we are analysing the evidence in order to decide whether there is an intelligent creator of the human eye. The evidence today is not simply the intricacy of the effect, the eye, but also the evolutionary process through which the effect was produced. We now know that the eye gradually improved over a long period of time through the process of variation and selection. Each improvement in the human eye was added to the simplest photoreceptors at different stages in its development. The simplest photo receptors, as in some protozoa, merely signalled that light was present or absent. These photoreceptors became better protected by being covered by a transparent layer of skin. Later a lens system evolved, as well as a muscle system to focus the lens and move the eye. When amphibians evolved, tear ducts developed for lubricating the eye, and later eyelids evolved to protect the eye. Binocular vision first appeared with the primates; the development of man produced the best colour vision, and so on. Thus the evolutionary history of the eye shows that each of its numerous features and improvements was gradually added at different periods of time in the distant past. Moreover, we also know the evolutionary process through which these improvements took place. Each feature in the human eye was added by a process of varia tion and natural selection. For example, at the stage when amphibians first evolved, none had tear ducts because they were not necessary for aquatic animals. But over time, there were numerous variations, due to genetic mutations and recombinations, some of which led to the development of tear ducts in some of these animals. Since these tear ducts were beneficial for lubricating the eye, those amphibians with tear ducts were slightly better adapted to their environment than those without. Thus they tended to have more offspring, and so by natural selection they gradually became prominent. It is very important to realize that even with this great increase in evidence about nature's evolutionary development, it is still possible for the theist to come up with good analogues of intelligent man working through a similar process to produce ordered artifacts. One's first reaction is to hope to find, at best, some contrived analogue of human intelligence using a remotely similar process to produce ordered artifacts. But actually the traditional watch analogue still works. People often think that the eighteenth-century</page><page sequence="9">EVOLUTION AND THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN 431 watch analogue (2) is outdated,' since we now know that the human eye (I) was produced by an evolutionary process gradually adding features over a long period of time. But these analogues are not outdated. Eighteenth century theists, who were wrong in thinking that the human eye had a non evolutionary history, were just as wrong in thinking that the watch or camera had a non-evolutionary history. The development of these man made artifacts was also an evolutionary one. Intricate artifacts like watches and cameras were not created in their present state all of a sudden. Rather it took several hundred years for them to be gradually improved. Just as the eye has an evolutionary history of having its numerous features added at different times in the past, so has the camera. The earliest cameras, in the seventeenth century, produced only an image on a screen at the back of the camera. Eighteenth-century cameras could record profiles on paper for only a brief time, and by I840 they had improved photographic plates that were able to record semi-permanent images. Then negatives were invented from which numerous prints could be made, and the improvement of roll film was introduced in the I890s. Flash powder has been superseded by the flash bulb, and colour film is now prevalent. Today more highly refined cameras adjust automatically to the light, pictures are developed and printed automatically in seconds, and so on. Thus, as with the eye, each improve ment in today's camera was added in a long, gradual development. More over, even the mechanism through which the camera was thus improved is similar to the mechanism through which the eye evolved. Each improvement was made through the process of variation and selection. Variations first arise when the inventor provides a new idea. These new ideas, such as the idea of putting film on a roll or the idea of a flash bulb, introduce novelties into the improvement process (just as genetic mutations do in nature). Next the industrial designer may take some of these new features and combine them with the other features of his line of cameras (similar to genetic re combinations in nature). For example, when roll film was invented industrial designers took this new feature and combined it with the other features, such as the camera size and lens type, of their own line of cameras. Finally these different variations of cameras with new combinations of features are placed on the marketplace to compete with the other kinds of cameras: the better adapted camera will be purchased in greater numbers, and thus to meet this demand the manufacturer will produce more of the better adapted cameras. For example, cameras with roll film had great advantages over the more cumbersome, expensive cameras using sheet film. Given these advantages, they were slightly more successful in surviving in the marketplace: more of these roll film cameras were purchased, and in turn more of them were manufactured, and thus by this selection process the better adapted gradu ally became the dominant type (analogous to natural selection). Thus the 1 For example, Loren Eiseley, Darwin's Century (Anchor Books, 196I), p. 197.</page><page sequence="10">432 KENNETH V. NELSON process by which human intelligence produced the camera is strikingly similar to the gradual evolutionary process by which the eye was produced (a similarity, I discovered later, even noted by Darwin in a different con text).' In fact, had a shrewd eighteenth-century theist carefully studied his watch analogy to note the process through which intelligence improved the watch, he could have used this to infer the basics of the process through which the eye evolved. Neither was created all at once in its final state; rather, both were gradually improved over a long period of time, with each improvement being added through a process in which a variation of types is followed by a natural selection of the better adapted. Given these similari ties, the theist today still has an analogue supporting his claim that the mechanism is one of intelligence: i. The mechanisms for the evolution of the world's order are analogous to the mechanisms human intelligence uses to produce ordered artifacts. And the analogy could be pushed even further. For example, in nature new genes for recombination are introduced into the population by the ' gene flow' from immigrants from neighbouring populations (as one country's camera makers benefit from the technology of cameras imported from an other country); reproductive success may sometimes favour non-adaptive properties (as a camera may succeed not by better adaptation but because of its nicer exterior colour), and so on. The two mechanisms have a striking, but overlooked, similarity. But this is not the end of the matter, and the theist has not yet proven his side. There are striking similarities between the evolutionary mechanisms in nature and the mechanisms humans use, but there are also striking dis similarities. In particular, I will argue for the following: 2. But there are disanalogies in that the mechanisms in nature took much longer, were much more indirect, and give less evidence of planning than those of human intelligence, thus suggesting less intelligence. The first main dissimilarity is that evolution in nature took much longer than man's creative processes. It took man a few hundred years to develop the highly sophisticated satellite reconnaissance cameras or the very complex computers. But, for example, it took well over a few hundred million years for the human eye to evolve from the primitive photoreceptors, and millions of years for the planets to form through gravitational forces (e.g. at an initial growth rate of one thousandth of a centimetre per year). Likewise it took about two billion years to get the basic building blocks of life in the process of chemical evolution. By comparison, the time it took man to discover how to synthesize in the laboratory the basic components of life was almost instan taneous. Secondly, evolution in nature was a very indirect process. The process looks rather direct if one lists only the successes, as I did in my brief sketch 1 On the Origin of Species (London, 1859), pp. 485-6.</page><page sequence="11">EVOLUTION AND THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN 433 of the past I8 billion years, e.g. stars were formed, then the heavy elements, then the planets, then life, then aquatic animals, then amphibians, then reptiles, then mammals, and then man. If one thus lists one successful stage after the other, it looks like a neat, ordered, direct sort of sequence. But that omits most of the evidence. For example, in the evolution of man, there were far more failures than successes; at each stage, by far most of the variations from mutations and recombinations are nonadaptive. And even if a varia tion does lead to an improvement and, much later, we get an ordered species, by far most of the species that ever existed are now extinct (far more than 99 per cent). Thus the process is not a nice, direct one: we do not always get precisely the right mutation, one species right after another, and so on. Rather the history of evolution is a history of groping, blind alleys, non adaptiveness, and failures. The third dissimilarity is that evolution in nature gives less evidence of planning than man's mechanisms do. This lack of planning shows up most clearly in the variation stage. The variations of artifacts produced by human intelligence are not always successful, but they do exhibit some degree of intelligent planning and direction, e.g. in zeroing in on the parts of the camera most needing improvement and then zeroing in on the potentially more useful variations. However in nature the variations from mutations and recombinations appear to be totally random. They affect all parts of the organism whether or not that part needs to be improved, and even for the parts that do need improvement, there is no correlation between the variations that occur and their potential usefulness in the particular circum stances. An intelligent man to some extent learns from his past mistakes. But in nature, the same mistakes are repeated over and over again (e.g. in the repetition of the genetic combinations producing malformed infants, or in the repetition of the mutation that produces haemophilia). Likewise, an intelligent man learns from past successes; but in nature these evolutionary processes do not appear to speed up considerably the second time around. For example, scientists say that life probably successfully evolved elsewhere before it first evolved on Earth, yet it still took 2 to 3 billion years for the process to be repeated here (whereas man learns somewhat from the success in nature and now creates the basics for life almost instantaneously). Further, an intelligent man is able to some extent to plan ahead and anticipate future events, e.g. to develop different transportation systems because of predicted future oil shortages. However, evolution in nature does not plan ahead; rather it is extremely short-sighted, adapting individuals only to the immediate circumstances. Thus the processes which produced the world's order took much more time, were much more indirect, and give less evidence of planning than the mechanisms man uses to create ordered artifacts. Granted, it is still perfectly consistent with this evidence that a very intelligent being created</page><page sequence="12">434 KENNETH V. NELSON the ordered world through these mechanisms. But my concern is whether that can be reasonably inferred from the evidence, not whether it is merely consistent with it (since many different hypotheses can, with a little in genuity, be made consistent with almost any evidence). And it seems unreasonable to say that these general features do not count against skill and intelligence (just as if the findings were instead that the world was created very directly and rapidly in seven days, it would be unreasonable for a naturalist to say that this does not count against non-intelligence). The time, directness, and evidence of planning do make a difference. For example, suppose that two people are taking a logic exam in which they are to prove a theorem. If one of them gets the proof quickly in five minutes, gives one step right after the other, and so on, that is the sort of mechanism that suggests intelligence. But if the other person takes several years to get the proof, by a process in which most of the attempts are clearly wrong, most of the premisses do not even make sense, and so on, the great time and indirectness of the process suggest less intelligence. Likewise, the details of the processes which produced the ordered world seem to suggest less in telligence than the processes man uses. It is possible that the causes of the ordered world, as well as this latter student, are extremely intelligent, but that is not the most reasonable inference given our available evidence. Thus although there are good analogues of intelligent men working through a similar evolutionary mechanism to produce order, a closer examination shows that the analogy can be turned against the theist. However, this does not show that naturalism is correct. The theist might well point out that the above dissimilarities only show that the cause of the ordered world seems to exhibit a degree of intelligence lower than man's. But that does not mean that it is non-intelligent (as the naturalist wants to claim). In the absence of any naturalistic analogues showing that the cause is non-intelligent, the inference of a cause of limited intelligence still might be reasonable. Thus what is needed is not simply a criticism of the theistic analogues, but a presentation of analogues in which order arises from non intelligence. Naturalists have traditionally offered many such analogues to show how the evolutionary mechanisms suggest non-intelligence (e.g. ana logues of winnowing baskets and sieves). But these analogues have run into problems. They have been either so remotely analogous to the world's evolutionary processes as to be unilluminating, or they have involved questionable claims. For example, the most common naturalistic analogue (found in the ancient world and revived by the eighteenth-century material ists) compared the development of the ordered world to the growth of an animal or a vegetable from primitive seeds into highly complex organisms. One problem with this analogue is that it is not at all clear that the intricate and complex process of the growth of an organism is an ultimately non intelligent process. A theist like Paley would see it instead as further evidence</page><page sequence="13">EVOLUTION AND THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN 435 of God's design. But if an organism's growth does not clearly seem to be a non-intelligent process, the analogue gives little support for the naturalistic claim that the world's development is likewise a non-intelligent process. I will briefly give some less controversial analogies to support the natural ist's claim: 3. The mechanisms for the evolution of the world's order are analogous to processes that clearly seem to happen non-intelligently. This would show that these evolutionary processes are not only dissimilar in important ways to those suggesting intelligence, they are also quite similar to what clearly seem to be non-intelligent processes. The task of finding naturalistic analogues is made considerably easier once it is realized that a good analogue need not always describe an actual, known case. For example, it does not matter that Hume uses analogues of hypothetical voices in clouds; nor does it matter whether Jesus' parable of the good Samaritan describes an actual person, or whether someone really did get a hole-in-one by my above mechanisms. Since such arguments from analogy only try to show what would be the most reasonable inference in the case in question, a good analogue in these arguments only needs to show what would clearly be the most reasonable inference in a similar case (be it real or fictional). Thus, although I think that there are analogues describing real cases which could be used to support 3, it might be simpler to give another hypothetical golfing example. Suppose that I know that two golf balls were on the edge of a green and that I could not observe the causes of their motion. But I do know that the first ball followed the break in the green perfectly and went directly into the hole. I might then reasonably infer that this was the work of an intelligent, skilful being. However, suppose that the second ball went in many random directions and distances, sometimes going far past the hole, sometimes barely moving for a long time, sometimes going away from the hole, and, after many years of such motion, finally went into the hole. In this case I would reasonably infer that this was the work of non-intelligent forces, although of course it is possible that it was not. But the process of biological evolution is similarly a very long, indirect process, with its random genetic variations, varying rates of evolution, numerous extinctions and failures, and so on. In short, the world's evolutionary processes are very similar to processes that clearly seem simply to happen non-intelligently. Thus the use of the traditional argument from analogy approach (I-3) tends to support the naturalistic interpretation that the world developed through non-intelligent forces. I will now depart from this approach of considering ordinary analogues like camera-making and golfing, and will introduce slightly different sorts of procedures to support the following: 4. Moreover, the mechanisms for the evolution of the world's order are paradigm cases of what could be reasonably expected from non-intelligence, but not from intelligence.</page><page sequence="14">436 KENNETH V. NELSON The first way to support this involves considering historical examples, the second is based upon considering hypothetical possible worlds. When considering 4, it seems difficult to try to think of what kinds of mech anisms would suggest intelligence or non-intellegence, since we now know the general features of what the mechanism in fact is. But there are some very good historical examples. Men in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries did not have any idea of what the mechanisms or processes were. Both the theist and the naturalist looked at the effect, for example the highly ordered planetary system. From this effect and their respective beliefs that the cause was intelligent or non-intelligent, they worked backwards and tried to infer what the mechanism was (whereas today we have the effect and the mechanism and are inferring the cause). Thus the theist argued as follows: 'I know that God created the planetary system, and the mechanism most suggestive of this is God taking matter, and in one day packing it together to form all the planets. So that's how they were produced.' The naturalist, on the other hand, argued: 'I know that the planetary system just happened by non-intelligent, natural processes. The way that something like that could happen would be if matter was initially dispersed, and gradually, over a very long period of time, clumps of matter stuck together and gravity gradually attracted matter to increase its size very slowly. So that's how it occurred.' Science now knows the mechanism and it is precisely this latter one. In fact, Descartes, being a theist, claimed that God did directly create the planets in their final state. However, he reasoned, if the planets did develop without any direct intelligent guidance, i.e. if they were produced by natural pro cesses and laws working totally on their own on a chaos of matter, it might have happened in this latter way of the gradual gravitational contraction of dispersed matter.' The mechanism that science now says was the mechanism for planetary formation is clearly not the one that the theists expected from an intelligent, skilful creator. Rather it is precisely the one that the natural ists and Descartes said would be how the world would have been produced if it was the work of natural forces working entirely on their own. (In fact Descartes is considered one of the founders of the modern scientific explana tion.) This of course does not entail that naturalism is correct. But it does suggest that the naturalist's conclusion that the world was the work of non intelligent forces is the more reasonable inference. Granted, it is possible that God can work in unexpected ways (just as it is possible that the person who proved the extremely elementary theorem by taking many years, with numerous mistakes and ill-formed statements, is really a very intelligent logician). But in these empirical arguments we aim only for the most reason able conclusion rather than the most unexpected or most unreasonable conclusion. There is a second, and more interesting, way of showing (step 4) that the 1 Discourse on Method, Part v.</page><page sequence="15">EVOLUTION AND THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN 437 mechanisms for producing the world's order are precisely what one would expect from non-intelligence. This is a slightly more complicated procedure developed as a way to answer a simple question. A theistic tendency often is to claim, no matter what details and mechanisms science discovers, that they are still the mechanisms of an intelligent being. Thus it is useful for such a person to ask himself: 'What sort of mechanism would I grant is the mechanism of non-intelligence?' When scientists knew only the effect and were discovering the mechanisms, they might have found that the order was produced by any of a number of different conceivable mechanisms. Which of these mechanisms would have seemed simply to be non-intelligent? Of all the possible mechanisms for producing an ordered world, some would clearly seem to be the mechanisms of intelligent creation, but others, it should be granted, would simply suggest non-intelligence. What would these paradigm intelligent and non-intelligent mechanisms be like? Finding the answer will involve switching the issue around: Rather than starting with the known mechanism and trying to see if it suggests intelligence or not, I will begin with the effect, the ordered world, and ask what kinds of hypo thetical mechanisms for producing it would clearly have seemed to be intelligent and which would clearly have seemed to be non-intelligent. Given my earlier point that good analogues could involve hypothetical cases, this procedure involves comparing the actual world not to hypothetical golf shots, but to other hypothetical worlds. These worlds have exactly the same ordered effects as the present world, for example solar systems, human bodies, and so on; but in each different possible world this same order was produced by a completely different mechanism. I want to consider which in this vast array of conceivable mechanisms would most clearly seem to be the work of intelligence and which would most clearly seem to be the work of non-intelligence. These will be compared to the actual mechanisms. I think that it is clear that the actual mechanisms are quite different from paradigm mechanisms most suggestive of intelligence. Consider the mechan ism of biological evolution. Certainly the hypothetical Biblical mechanism of all the present plants and animals being produced in only a few days from totally unordered matter through a direct, mistake-free process, would be a paradigm possible world mechanism most clearly suggesting intelligence. If science had discovered this possible mechanism to be the actual one, the reasonable inference would clearly have been theistic. But the actual mechanisms science discovered are very different. Moreover, hypothetical possible world mechanisms which are even evolutionary could still be paradigm mechanisms suggesting intelligence. For example, the possible world in which the evolutionary mechanism was very rapid, in which precisely the right mutations always occurred when needed, in which only useful mutations occurred, in which new species occurred at regular intervals, in which the rate of evolution was constant, in which no species</page><page sequence="16">438 KENNETH V. NELSON once created ever became extinct, and so on, would also clearly suggest intelligence. However, the mechanism science discovered is quite dissimilar to this paradigm intelligence mechanism too. In short, it is different from the kinds of hypothetical mechanisms that would be most suggestive of in telligence. Or, as another way of looking at it, there are clearly numerous ways that the actual mechanism could be changed to make it much more suggestive of intelligence. But whereas the actual mechanism is quite different from paradigm intelligence mechanisms, it is not that different from paradigm non intelligence mechanisms. In fact, it is difficult to think of mechanisms more suggestive of non-intelligence than the actual one. A paradigm non-intelligent mechanism could be expected to take a very long time rather than be extremely rapid, to produce the order very gradually from more primitive order, to be very indirect and to have numerous mistakes and failures rather than have none, and so on. But these are precisely the features of the actual mechanism. Imagine a theist and a naturalist discussing each future dis covery about the process. Before they knew how long the process took, if asked which findings would be most supportive of their side, a theist would say: an extremely rapid process, a naturalist: a very long one. Science dis covered it to be the latter. Before they knew the directness of the process, a theist would have wanted the findings to be those most suggestive of intelli gence: a neat, precise process; a naturalist would have expected far more extinctions and blind alleys than successes. Science discovered it to be the latter. The same is true for the other main features of the process. The kinds of features that one would put into a hypothetical mechanism to make it most suggestive of non-intelligence are just like the features of the actual mechanism. There seems to be little in this mechanism that a naturalist would like to change to make the process look more like the work of non intelligent forces. Thus of the vast array of possible mechanisms that might have been used to produce the ordered world, some would look intelligent, others simply non-intelligent. Science could have discovered either kind. But the mechan isms actually discovered were quite unlike the kind of mechanisms most suggestive of intelligence, and precisely what one would expect from non intelligence. This point (step 4) of course does not entail that naturalism is correct. But this and my previous points all support the following: 5. Hence it is reasonable to infer that the cause of the world's order is non-intelligent. Whereas in the eighteenth century the available evidence supported theism as the most reasonable inference, the additional scientific evidence that we now have has changed that completely. It is possible that the cause is intelligent, but given our evidence today the more reasonable inference is naturalism.</page><page sequence="17">EVOLUTION AND THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN 439 Finally, I want to consider other positions that a theist could adopt given the failure of the traditional theistic position. The first is called deism. According to a version of deism, God set up the world to let it go entirely on its own. Here it is not claimed that God directly created the planets and other ordered systems in nature. Rather God created the initial matter and energy with its basic properties, for instance gravity and motion, and then let it go entirely on its own to produce the ordered world. On this view, God is not directly working through the evolutionary mechanisms (which I called the theistic view). Rather the deist puts God one step back: God set it up, and then'he let it evolve entirely on its own. In terms of the above scientific mechanisms, God set things up before the initial cosmic explosion, and the world has been operating on its own since then. The analogue for the theistic position was man directly making a watch or camera. Presumably the ana logue for the deistic position might instead be man making a totally self operating, self-perpetuating factory to produce watches: It is a fully auto mated, evolutionary factory which starts with primitive metal and gradually builds a complex watch by adding parts along the way. The factory works totally on its own, and nowhere in the factory at any stage in the production of the watch do you find a man. According to the deist, the naturalist is like someone trying to explain fully the order in watches by saying that they were created by automated, assembly-line machines, without mentioning that the assembly-line machines themselves were made by intelligence. I think that this position is more plausible than the theistic one, and it is the first alternative usually considered, for example, by Descartes, Kant, and Darwin, once one realizes that the evolutionary mechanisms simply do not exhibit God's direct operation. What seems intuitively plausible about deism is that these apparently unguided evolutionary mechanisms none the less did produce a highly ordered world from a totally unordered clump of matter. Even though there have been many disasters and extinctions in the past and will be in the future (e.g. when the sun explodes in about six billion years, thus ending the order in our solar system), the overall tendency of the uni verse in the past I8 billion years clearly has been to produce more and more order (i.e. from the initial unordered matter to produce stars, then planets, life, animals, and so on). This apparent tendency of the universe to increase order might suggest that there was an intelligent creator setting it up that way. However, this is a selective presentation of the evidence. Granted that the world's order has greatly increased since the cosmic explosion I8 billion years ago, that is still just an atypical part of the even longer-range tendency of the universe. Scientists now tend to doubt that the order will always increase (in a 'hyperbolic universe'). Rather, scientists now seem to favour slightly the 'pulsating universe', in which, during cycles of approximately 82 billion years, there is first a period of expansion and increased order,</page><page sequence="18">440 KENNETH V. NELSON followed by a period of contraction and decreased order, and then the cycle is repeated. By the end of each cycle, the initial disordered clump of matter has returned to the same disordered state. (That is because the matter in the expanding universe will not exceed the escape velocity of its own gravitational field: so after reaching a state of maximum expansion it will contract again, during which time energy will be outpouring so matter will be broken down into its simple state again just before the next cosmic explosion.) If this is correct, then to say that the world was set up to increase continually in order seems to be simply mistaken. Total disorder is as much the outcome as order is (and total disorder may in fact be the ultimate effect if there is a damping effect in these pulses). None the less it is still a fact that in portions of these cycles order was pro duced. And this might at first suggest that some intelligent being set up the system to increase in order at least some times. However, simply finding a system in which there is an increase in order does not mean that it was set up by an intelligent cause (recall the earlier golfing examples). Again, we need to analyse the particular initial conditions and mechanisms to see if they give evidence of intelligent contrivance. The mechanisms and initial conditions of the automated watch factory in the deistic analogue do clearly suggest intelligence, but those of the natural world do not. One feature of the watch factory that suggests its intelligent contrivance is that it produces watches by a fast, efficient process. However, as I have argued above, such efficiency simply does not show up in the mechanisms producing the ordered world. For example, it took billions of years for the chemical evolution of life to occur, and during this time by far most of the random combinations of particles were non-adaptive. Even man can set up more efficient processes for the evolution of the basic components of life by adding certain enzymes. But even though the skill of a creator simply does not show up in the pro cess, the main question is whether it shows up in the initial conditions of the universe. The deist claims that an intelligent creator set up the world in the beginning so that it would produce more and more order entirely on its own. In the deistic analogue of the automated factory, the intelligence of its creators is clearly evident in the setting up of such a complex and intricate factory, in fact much more intricate than the watch it produces. But the initial conditions in nature were not systems like huge, self-perpetuating factories which create planets and then hurl them into space. Rather they were simply unordered matter and energy subject to basic gravitational and atomic forces; and it is less clear that these suggest intelligent contrivance. It will not do to claim that the existence of simply an initial clump of matter and energy with any properties requires the existence of a super-intelligent creator. That shifts the issue from the argument from design to the less plausible cosmological argument, which I will not consider here. The</page><page sequence="19">EVOLUTION AND THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN 44I argument from design is based, not just on the existence of anything, but on there being something special in the initial conditions that would suggest intelligent contrivance. And the present scientific evidence does not seem to suggest that. However, it should be stressed that there might be future scientific findings that would support deism, for example, if it were found that of all the possible configurations of initial properties we just happen to have precisely the ones that would lead to order, and a slight change in the law of gravity or in the initial energy would lead to total disorder. But the current findings do not indicate that these are special initial conditions neatly set up to produce order (e.g. scientists do not think that gravity is a special property added to matter but simply the curvature of space determined by the distribution of matter). If a naturalist could choose initial conditions less suggestive of intelligence, it is not clear what they could be. However, it should be stressed that the inference against deism is much more tentative than the earlier inference against theism. The earlier evolutionary mechan isms are generally well-supported, but many of the details of cosmology about the initial conditions of the universe are rather uncertain. The known general features of the initial conditions do suggest non-intelligence, but it is possible that many of the future detailed scientific findings might shift the evidence back to support deism. So although it is now less plausible than naturalism, deism will not be ruled out until the scientific findings are more definite. Although the deistic and theistic conceptions of God are the main ones that I will consider here, it should be noted that there are other conceptions of how God created the ordered world (and hence different kinds of ana logues). For example, rather than the theistic God who is in total, direct control of the evolutionary processes (e.g. causing every mutation in bio logical evolution), or the kind of deistic God who just set up the processes and lets them work entirely on their own, God might be like a man who is an artificial breeder of horses who intervenes only from time to time in the process to produce an ordered result (e.g. causing one particular mutation when it is especially needed). However, the problem again is that it is not enough for this explanation to be possible; rather it must be reasonably in ferred from the known evidence about the world. And the evidence suggests randomness where this view claims that the processes exhibit intelligent intervention. For example, when there is a major ecological shift, just the right mutations do not seem to happen so that the species will survive; rather, almost all of the species are simply wiped out. And if the supposed intervention is too slight to be detected, it is too slight to give evidence of God's existence. Likewise there is a panentheistic conception of God. On such a view, God is related to the world as a man's mind is related to his body. The evolution of the world is the growth and development of God's body (though given the pulsating universe of modern cosmology this will</page><page sequence="20">442 KENNETH V. NELSON involve also his deterioration, death, and rebirth in each cosmic cycle). Thus the analogy for God's creation of the world's order is not that of a watchmaker working on a separate piece of metal. Rather, it is presumably more like God improving the order on his own body, the world, as an athlete, by going through a series of isometric exercises, might produce a more highly ordered muscle system. Such an analogue gives a different view of how God might directly create the ordered world, but panentheism is still undermined by the discovery of the evolutionary mechanisms. The world's development is quite unlike a wise athlete's skilful development of his body, and more like a body that over a very long time (through random redistribu tions of tissue rather than through obvious planning), has produced more sprained muscles, cramps, and torn ligaments than developed muscles, a body in which most of the muscles that did develop have wasted away, a poorly developed body in which the muscle groups conflict and wipe each other out, and so on. In such a case there is less support for an inference that a mind is intelligently guiding this process than for the inference that the body is simply not under a mind's intelligent control. There are other con ceptions of how God might have created the world, but they also face the same general problem of finding evidence to support them stronger than the evidence for naturalism (steps 3-4). The last main position I will consider is a version of what is called fideism. Unlike a deist or a theist, a fideist might not be bothered by my conclusion that the empirical evidence supports naturalism; for he agrees that one cannot infer by reason that God created the ordered world. However, he none the less believes, solely on faith, that God did create it, but in an undetectable way. God did it this way so that man would not believe in him through some coercive, empirical argument, but rather through a loving, personal rela tionship. An analogue for the fideistic position might be a parent who gives gifts to his child in an undetectable way (e.g. invoking Santa Claus at Christmas), so that the child's love is not bought or forced by empirical things. Rather, the parent, like God, wants to be loved for himself, through a loving, personal relationship. Fideism has some plausibility in that most people do accept religious claims this way, on faith or personal experiences rather than reason. And it is consistent especially with Christianity. The basic Christian claim that in a backward country God became a carpenter, misunderstood by his contemporaries and put to a humiliating death, is also something not inferred by reason, as St Paul stressed. Likewise God as creator of the world is undetectable by reason. However, I think that there are some problems with fideism. First, it is important to note that such fideists grant that the argument from design fails, which is what I have been trying to show. But in doing so, they deviate from traditional theism in a major way by giving up the claim of the Psalms: 'The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handi</page><page sequence="21">EVOLUTION AND THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN 443 work." Secondly, it is questionable to say that reason and empirical evidence are undesirable. The parent who wanted his child to have a loving, personal relationship with him presumably would not want to arrange the empirical evidence to make it reasonable for the child to think that the parent did not even exist. Accepting on faith that there is an intelligent creator of the world would be more plausible if this were faith supplementing inadequate, in conclusive reason. But reason is not helpless in determining the relative merits of theism and naturalism: it supports naturalism. However, the main problem with fideism is the following: If God did not want any empirical evidence for his existence, why was the empirical evidence for his existence so strong up until the twentieth century? As I have argued above, the empirical evidence in the eighteenth century clearly supported the theistic inference of intelligence as the most reasonable inference. This seems to undermine the fideist's claim that God's plan was to make his creation of the world undetectable to reason. Fideism would have been much more plausible if the empirical evidence was always worthless: neither for theism in the eighteenth century nor for naturalism now. Finally I want to consider the agnostic position that we simply do not have the evidence or reasoning power to solve difficult problems such as the nature of the cause of this immense and unique ordered world. Such agnosti cism seemed more justified in the eighteenth century than today. I noted above that whereas in the eighteenth century theism was supported by the available evidence, a form of agnosticism might also have been justified since half of the relevant evidence, viz., the mechanisms through which the order was produced, was simply missing. Whether agnosticism might be justified today depends upon which theistic position is being considered. I have argued that today the available evidence clearly supports naturalism over what I have called the traditional theistic position. On this issue agnosticism seems less justified: the basic outlines of these evolutionary mechanisms are rather well-established, and my evaluation was based solely on these general features. However, an agnostic position would be more justified concerning the inference of naturalism over deism. The known available evidence does support naturalism, but many basic questions of cosmology about the world's initial conditions are still unanswered. Given the uncertainties about the evidence, one clearly should not hold naturalism dogmatically. Just as this last century's scientific findings shifted the weight of the evidence to naturalism, it is conceivable that future scientific findings (or even scientific findings of today of which I am unaware) may shift the evidence back to support the inference of some sort of intelligent creation. 1 Psalms i9:i.</page></plain_text>
