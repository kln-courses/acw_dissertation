JULY, 1919 NO. 3 THE MONIST THE LAW OF PARSIMONY. 66/^VCCAM'S RAZOR" is usually quoted in the form V^/ Entia non sunt multiplicando, praeter n cessitaient, but it seems to be doubtful whether the "invincible doctor" actually used these words.1 If he did not, however, he used others very similar, as for example, Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora ; and since the "razor" is commonly used nowadays without special reference to 1 See W. M. Thorburn. Mind, N. S., No. 94, pp. 287-288. Mr. Thorburn gives many references to the text of Occam (or Ockham), and also cites Haur au (Philosophie scholastique, Chap. XXVIII), Erdmann (History of Philosophy, I, s. 216), De Wulf (Medioval Philosophy, s. 368), and Pra tl (Geschichte der Logik, pp. 327-340). The English reader will find a general account of Occam in The Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. XV, p. 636, in St ckl's History of Mediaval Philosophy (T. A. Finlay's translation, pp. 422-427), and in the late Dr. T. M. Lindsay's article on Occam in the Encyclopedia Britannica (11th ed., Vol. XIX). Mr. C. Delisle Burns wrote an article entitled "William of Ockham on Continuity" (Mind, N. S., No. 100), calling attention to certain parallels between Occam's views on continuity and those of Mr. Bertrand Russell. A characteristic note of Sir William Hamilton's on the history of the Law of Parcimony (this spelling is sometimes preferred) may be mentioned in this connection. Hamilton says that the Law of Parcimony should be expressed as follows: "Neither more nor more onerous causes are to be assumed than are necessary to account for the phenomena." Then he continues: "This phasis of the law has long been fully promulgated. Every condition of any consequence has, indeed, been articulately laid down by Aristotle; and subsequent philosophers, among whom Galen is conspicuous, have only re peated what was so clearly and so frequently inculcated by the Stagirite. Not only is it a maxim of his philosophy that God and Nature never operate without effect (oM v n r^v, o v Weiw s votovci), they never operate super fluously (md v irepUpyov--veptrrw-&amp;pyws), but always through one rather than through a plurality of means (Ka6* iv p&amp;Xkov % Kar woXX ). The scholastic axioms : Principia non sunt cumulanda; Frustra Ht per plura quod fieri potest per pandora; Natura horret superfiuum, these simply embody Aristotle's dicta ; and the same, with a modification, is manifest of the Novaculum Nominalium or Occam's razor : Entia non sunt multiplicando praeter necessitatem. Newton's first and principal rule of philosophizing, in so far as it is accurately expressed, simply repeats Aristotle's law : Effectuum naturalism causae, non plures sunt admittendae quam quae, et verae sunt, et effectibus explicandis sufficiunf (Discussions on Philosophy, 3d edition, p. 624).</page><page sequence="2">322 THE MONIST. the scholastic theory of entities or universals, the precise form in which Occam stated it is irrelevant. Among modern writers the principle is cited in very various connections. Sometimes it is regarded merely as a rule of method in the judicious choice of hypotheses. Scientific explanation cannot dispense with hypotheses, but it should be as sparing of them as it can. The principle of parsimony, in this sense, is therefore but a "safety razor" designed to protect against the dangers besetting the use of an indispensable instrument. On the other hand, the law of simplicity or economy in thinking is sometimes acclaimed as if it provided some sort of absolute guidance, and is even treated as the very essence of science, and therefore, one would suppose, of knowable reality. The design of this paper is to consider the principle both in its narrower aspect and in the more extended applications of it. As a preliminary to this inquiry, some general reflec tions concerning the principle and its difficulties seem to be required. The maxim itself is naturally understood as a general appeal for economy couched in negative language denoun cing extravagance. General appeals for economy have been common from the days of Isaiah the son of Amoz, but it is hard to see why a sumptuary edict of this sort should be more effective in matters of thinking than in matters political. Even when the need for economy is sincerely recognized it is never easy to determine where the path of true economy lies, for the simple reason that waste, luxury, and extravagance are relative terms. Why, then, should things be otherwise in this affair of thinking? Every one realizes that it is foolish to be recklessly prodigal of assumptions. That way incapacity lies. But in particu lar cases it is usually very difficult to prove that any given assumption is necessarily superfluous in every regard, very arbitrary to determine which regard is to be preferable to</page><page sequence="3">THE LAW OF PARSIMONY. 323 all others, and entirely impossible to legislate a priori on the question. None the less there is a disposition in certain quarters to apply the principle of parsimony to scientific investiga tions in a fashion that is neither merely negative nor merely regulative. Dr. Whitehead, for example, while disclaim ing any knowledge of what he calls the metaphysical valid ity of Occam's razor, claims that the maxim has its roots in something deeper than logical elegance, and that it is obviously valid in scientific inquiries since "every use of hypothetical entities diminishes the claims of scientific rea soning to be the necessary outcome of harmony between thought and sense-presentation. As hypothesis increases, necessity diminishes."2 Mr. Russell, again, although he states in one place that when science selects the simplest formula that will fit the facts "this, quite obviously, is merely a methodological precept, not a law of nature,"3 expresses himself at other times in a way that conveys a different suggestion. "By the principle of Occam's razor," he says, "if the class of appearances will fulfil the purposes for the sake of which the thing was invented by the prehistoric metaphysicians to whom common sense is due, economy demands that we should identify the thing with the class of its appearances" ;4 and he goes on to state in the next paragraph that "the supreme maxim in scientific philosophizing is this : Where ever possible, logical constructions are to be substituted for inferred entities." These statements, it is true, are not directly contra dictory since the second of them professes to be concerned only with a supposed hypothesis of prehistoric metaphy sicians, and since Mr. Russell adds that "it is not necessary 2 The Organisation of Thought, pp. 175-176. 8 Mysticism and Logic, p. 204. * Ibid., p. 155.</page><page sequence="4">3*4 THE MONIST. to deny a substance or substratum underlying these appear ances; it is merely expedient to abstain from asserting this unnecessary entity."8 At the same time the difference of emphasis between them is very notable and shows that there is room for inquiry concerning the limits within which Occam's razor can be applied in scientific theory. Still wider fields for discussion appear when the principle of intellectual economy receives the interpretation which Mach and others have given it. Mach affirms that the economical office of science is really its ultimate function, and claims that the full recognition of the economy of scientific thought is at the same time the abandonment of mystery in science.6 He defines physics as "sense-ex perience economically arranged."7 This view, in some form, is characteristic of the Kirchhoff school, and of the theories of many of the pragmatists. It will be considered in the later part of this paper. The earlier part will deal with the application of Occam's razor to the theory of hypotheses. It is usual to distinguish between hypotheses concern ing a fact and hypotheses concerning laws. The first class includes all suggested answers to such questions as "How did Cleopatra die?" or "Who stole the portrait of Mona Lisa?" Such hypotheses are attempts at reconstruction whose aim is the discovery of a single unique chain of events. Facts come to us piecemeal, but we cannot believe that they occurred piecemeal, and we endeavor to trace their history. In doing so we presuppose a certain con stancy and continuity in nature, and the tracing of this continuity and constancy is quite as essential a part of scientific investigation as the task of generalizing from given data. *Ibid. 6 See, e. g., The Science of Mechanics (Eng. translation), pp. 481ff. 7 Popul rwissenschaftliche Vorlesungen, p. 219.</page><page sequence="5">THE LAW OF PARSIMONY. 325 The main condition of the problem in attempting this kind of explanation is that the events which happened had just one history. To discover this history it is necessary to piece together such facts as are known to have occurred, and to frame conjectures concerning the gaps in the story which have not yet been ascertained. It might seem, then, that there is no room in such cases for any application of the principle of parsimony, and indeed that simplification of any sort is the chief error to guard against. Indeed, all the famous detectives of modern fiction explain that they owe their success, under Providence, to the fact that they are less liable than the police or than their biographers to be blinded by the glamor of the simplest theory. They find that it pays to follow every clue to its subtlest rami fication. This criticism, however, would plainly be mistaken. Simplification can never be correctly interpreted to mean the neglect of relevant data. Again, the fact that the events under investigation can have had but one history (which therefore simply was without any question of sim plicity or the reverse) is irrelevant with regard to hypoth eses concerning the way in which these events may be supposed to have happened before their history was traced. It is easy enough to make extravagant assumptions in these cases, and it is frequently a work of genius to dis cover the one correct explanation where so many are pos sible on the evidence. Moreover, it is clear that if the "correct" explanation is only probable and not quite cer tain, the principle of parsimony enters. A man is seen to go into a house. Two hours later he is observed to leave it wheeling a heavy load. If the load proves to be a corpse recently strangled, it will not avail the man to urge that the murder was done by an unknown assailant who en tered and made his escape during that period. It may indeed be impossible to prove that there was no such as</page><page sequence="6">326 THE MONIST. sailant, but the jury do not require this hypothesis. They employ the principle of parsimony. In this case, however, their hypothesis deals with what they suppose to be a suffi cient cause of the event, and it is with regard to causes (and more generally to correlations) that the law of parsi mony is usually employed. According to Mach and the Kirchhoff school the laws of nature are merely concise general descriptions of phe nomena, and the aim of science is to discover the most compendious descriptions of this kind. These statements, however, are somewhat misleading since they seem to ig nore the characteristic function of induction. Induction is not mere description, but essentially a process of in ference. It is inference from the observed to the unob served, and the ultimate logical problem of induction is just the question how far this inference from given data to unobserved cases is valid. The most striking instance of this logical problem is the question of the validity of prediction, but precisely the same problem occurs in retro spective inductive inference. This definition, however, might be amended to meet such criticisms, and causal laws might be interpreted to mean the general descriptions of a class of relations hold ing between phenomena. Induction involves generaliza tion and is the process whereby, when certain relations have been ascertained to hold between a given number of observed instances without contrary instances, the number of such observations is deemed sufficient to justify the in ference that it is probable that these relations hold in every instance of the occurrence of phenomena of the kind at any time or place. The class so described is not an empir ical collection of observed cases. On the contrary only a few of its members have been observed. But on the strength of the observation of a few instances the inference is drawn that certain of the characteristics found in these</page><page sequence="7">THE LAW OF PARSIMONY. 327 instances may be presumed to be true of every instance of the kind whether this instance is observed or unobserved, and, indeed, whether or not it is empirically possible to observe the instance. Such laws are also held to be true hypothetically when nothing of the sort occurred. No one doubts that Socrates would have died if he had stabbed him self to the heart before the time came for him to drink the hemlock, although, in point of fact, he preferred to await the due execution of the law. Hypotheses concerning laws, therefore, imply a process whereby the analysis of a group of observed cases is ex tended by analogy to any member of the whole class of such cases. This procedure, it is plain, is connected with a principle of simplification. The analysis itself is selective since it endeavors to apprehend and retain the salient and relevant connections common to the observed cases, neg lecting the others. Selective analysis is therefore in one of its aspects a process of simplification. Again there is simplification in the mere fact of dealing with a class in place of its several members. The definition of the class concept supplies a rule for dealing with particular cases as need arises. It does not require the investigation of each particular instance. Indeed, when the number of members of the class is either indefinite so far as our information goes, or actually infinite, there is no chance of undertaking the detailed separate investigation. Moreover, the uni versal relationships common to the members of any class do not exhaust the individual characteristics of those mem bers. There are limits set to generalization in the nature of things. The complexity of phenomena, in one sense, must simply be accepted. Nothing can make things less complex than they are; and the goal of scientific investi gation is to select certain broad principles of relation, highly abstract and simple in themselves, which permit of</page><page sequence="8">328 THE MONIST. precise deduction according to a rule. This is the kind of knowledge which brings power with it. There seems, however, to be no royal road to the kind of simplicity which is required, and the circumstance that a universal is always abstract when compared with a par ticular does not warrant any conclusion concerning which universals are most fundamental in any given case, or what universals can be safely neglected. It is not at all obvious, for instance, why the insight of scientific thinkers should have seized, during so many centuries, upon the primary qualities to the neglect of the secondary. Even granting that the primary qualities are the meeting-place of many diverse sensations, it is, to say the least, curious that they should have been so persistently supposed to be the sole characteristics of objective reality. The kind of simplicity most useful for science must be known by its fruits, and not on account of any antecedent argument concerning simplicity, except in respect of the quite general require ment that in proportion as a hypothesis is capable of being elaborated deductively it is likely to be useful for explana tory purposes. It should be noted, moreover, that the abstract sim plicity of general relations is not the only element required in scientific explanations. Mach says, it is true, that "con tinuity, economy, and constancy mutually condition one another," and that "they are really only different aspects of one and the same property of all sound thinking."8 This statement is an excellent example of illegitimate simpli fication. It alleges that three distinct factors are aspects of one of the factors. Surely it is clear that there may be a very simple set of logical relations between isolated and momentary phenomena. The demand for continuity and constancy in the world, particularly as the medium 8 The Analysis of Sensations (Eng. translation, ed. 1914), p. 328.</page><page sequence="9">THE LAW OF PARSIMONY. 329 within which causal laws hold, is therefore quite distinct from the demand for simplicity. If the sole aim of science were the discovery by analysis of the logical relations between phenomena, a large number of suggestions in scientific works would have, at best, the value of mere illustrations. For instance, the desire to suggest or construct a model acting according to any given formula would have no scientific justification. When the equations have been discovered, where is the need for a model? In this view also, there would be little meaning in Hertz's conception of physics according to which the object of that science is the construction of an image repre senting the behavior of the phenomena in the sense that the logical deductions from the character of this image agree with the observed results. Model and image alike are as particular as the observed phenomena. Moreover, both of them contain irrelevant features since neither image nor model can be mere instances of the logical relations expressed in the formula. Such images or models, there fore, would be nothing but aids to the imagination. In that case it is hard to understand why so much at tention should have been devoted to them. Why should Faraday's suggestions of this kind, or Lord Kelvin's, be accounted works of genius, and why should a physicist of Schuster's eminence regard any theory which confines itself to logical analysis as an evasion of the task of science ?. Why should Newton have argued as he did concerning actio in distans? Newton, as is well known, stated in his Regulae Philosophandi that he refrained altogether from making hypotheses concerning gravitation. He confined himself to the laws which could be deduced by analysis of the phenomena. But he also denied strenuously that actio in distans could be interpreted as a vera causa, saying that 9 "This evasive school of philosophy," Schuster, The Theory of Optics, Preface.</page><page sequence="10">330 THE MONIST. this was so great an absurdity that he believed "no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it." "Gravity," he went on to say, "must be caused by an agent acting constantly ac cording to certain laws."10 If the bodies of scientific theory are regarded as foci within a field, this view of Newton's can scarcely seem evident. The necessity for it was due to the conception that physical bodies, like the "things" of common sense, are defined by their enclosure in a limited spatial area, the consequence being that actio in distans was a plain negation of any real continuity in causal action. It was necessary, therefore, that there should be a common agent for things correlated according to the formula of gravitation, and a connecting medium for the action of this agent. On these assumptions Newton's argument was just, and the distinc tion he drew between an agent acting uniformly and a uniform formula of correlation very noteworthy. He re garded the discovery, through analysis, of a correlation in the phenomena as a radically incomplete explanation however important the correlation might be. Moreover, he thought that a full account of the kind of substance acting according to the formula, and of the continuous presence and operation of this substance, was required. It might be argued, it is true, that the observed phe nomena themselves are the only substances in the case. These observed facts, however, are far too few and too scattered to permit this interpretation. Whatever happens in the world must be regarded as part of the continuous connected whole, and the mere fact of correlation between certain fragments of this whole, arbitrarily selected or subjectively revealed, is not enough for the purposes of explanation. Other entities than the observed facts, on the one hand, and the formulas of connection, on the other, 10 Letter to Bentley, Feb. 25, 1692-1693.</page><page sequence="11">THE LAW OF PARSIMONY. must be supposed. These entities must often be hypothet ical since they cannot be verified by ordinary methods, and it is not likely that there is only one set of hypothetical entities which can be conceived to meet this legitimate demand for continuity. The principle of parsimony, there fore, if it is really fundamental, should be fitted to decide why a preference should be given to one class of these en tities rather than to another. As we have seen, Mr. Russell maintains that it is. The most usual theory of the physical world, he shows, is de rived from the common-sense notion of a "thing." Common sense speedily substitutes the notion of permanent things in space for the series of sense-data, fluctuating and vary ing with each individual percipient, which are actually ob served. Thence arises the theory that the material universe consists of bodies possessing only primary qualities and occupying definitive positions in absolute space at definitive moments of absolute time. The actual data of sense are subsequently explained as resultants of the action of these physical objects upon a certain set of physical objects which we call sense-organs and the brain, peculiarly connected with the mind. Mr. Russell holds that this hypothesis is an offense against the principle of parsimony. In the first place, phys ical objects as thus conceived are quite unverifiable. What we perceive necessarily consists of sense-data; and these, on account of the familiar arguments proving the relativity of sense-data to the percipient, cannot be identified with physical objects. In the second place, these hypothetical physical objects are supposed to cause our perceptions, but this supposition ignores one of the cardinal rules in the discovery of causes. If A can be inferred to be causally connected with B, both A and B must have been frequently observed together without any contrary instances having been discovered after a stringent search for them. Accor</page><page sequence="12">332 THE MONIST. ding to the usual theory, however, this supposed cause is never observed and never can be observed. It is only the hypothetical correlate of certain observed facts. Thus, by all the rules, this inference is an exceedingly precarious one, and these hypothetical correlates should be abandoned if possible. Mr. Russell, accordingly, brings forward an alterna tive theory according to which physical objects are certain series of perceived sense-data and of unperceived sensibilia. The weakest part of this important theory, however, seems to be its reliance on the principle of parsimony. Even in terms of this principle, support for the new hypothesis could be claimed in two cases only. Either the new hypoth esis is simpler than the old in all respects, or it is simpler in the most important respects. The first of these claims, as will speedily appear, is quite untenable. The second is always open to the objection that the standard of impor tance must be arbitrary and subjective. No theory of the nature of the physical world can avoid making some unverifiable assumptions, and Mr. Russell's theory is certainly not exempt from this inevitable fate. His theory, in its present form, requires him not only to accept the present and the remembered sense-data of some individual experient, but also to postulate the existence of the present and remembered sense-data of other experients, and an immense range of sensibilia which are not actually sensed at all and can only be described as possible sense data. The first of these postulates may be accepted with out challenge. The second, however, calls for comment. The present and remembered sense-data of all human percipients do not form a world, but merely scraps of a world; and the reason why this or the other percipient should perceive this or that at any given time requires the assumption of continuous connection in this world. The mere existence of sense-data is not self-explanatory. Harris</page><page sequence="13">THE LAW OF PARSIMONY. 333 perceives a plate and a letter at breakfast time. He wants to know how the collection of sense-data which he calls a letter comes to be there, and he can scarcely do this with out believing in a regular postal service. Again he is bound to reflect on the question how the same or a very similar collection of sense-data, called a plate, fulfils the same office for him every morning, and what he means by saying that the plate is on a shelf in his pantry when he and his household are asleep, and his cat is absent on a nocturnal ramble. To interpret these and similar experi ences, Harris must be assured of the truth of a large, and, indeed, of an infinite number of hypothetical propositions. The plate, he knows, would look so and so in such and such a light ; it would be part of an indistinguishable blur if he spun it on the table ; it would look very different if he stood on his head and watched it; and if he were intoxicated or very sleepy it would assume all sorts of strange appear ances. The great advantage of the ordinary theory of percep tion is that it does not require us to assume the existence of any appearances except those which are actually presented to some percipient as the result of the stimulation of his sense-organs. These bizarre appearances, therefore, need not be supposed to exist except when Harris perceives them, and their peculiarities can then be explained by the state of Harris's nervous system. On the other hand, any theory which considers itself at liberty to assume the ex istence of unperceived sensibilia, the same in character as perceived sense-data, whenever there is a proved lack of continuity, suffers from the defect that it cannot logically set bounds to the number of these sensibilia. Like the magician in the fable it has made the well yield water, and cannot stop the flow. If it is legitimate (as, according to Mr. Russell's theory, it is necessary) to argue that the plate is not merely the circular disk which Harris per</page><page sequence="14">334 THE MONIST, ceives when he looks down on it, but that it is also, at the very same time, the whole multitude of ellipses which he would perceive from this or the other angle, it must also be legitimate to argue that it is, in addition, any appearance which he would perceive if he were dazed or drunk. More over, Harris's dog, and cat, and canary, and the wasp on his window pane have a right to be consulted. If the plate at any time is the whole collection of colored shapes which Harris or any other man would perceive from any possible point of view, it should also, by the same argument, include what any other animal would perceive. It may well be doubted, therefore, whether a theory requiring such an enor mous number of unperceived sensibles is any simpler than the one it is designed to supplant. Of course, if a logical con struction can always be devised to replace an inferred en tity, then any inferred entity in physics can be replaced by a logical construction. A logical construction, however, neither exists nor is a cause. If the whole realm of ex istence were composed of the sense-data of those human beings and other animals which have existed up to the pre sent, and if these sense-data were the only actual causes in the world, then there would be no room for the inferred entities of current physical theory. But no one's sense data can be explained without assuming the existence of other entities than these sense-data. The choice is, therefore, between inferring entities of the type of atoms and mol ecules, and inferring the existence of an enormous number of unperceived sensibles which yet are supposed to exist and to operate in precisely the same fashion as the per ceived sense-data. This hypothesis of concealed sensibles is possibly the better of the two. But it cannot be said to be required by the principle of parsimony. We may conclude, therefore, that general appeals to the principle of parsimony cannot settle questions of this character, a fact which is an important comment upon the</page><page sequence="15">THE LAW OF PARSIMONY. 335 limitations of the principle of parsimony even when re garded as a rule for the choice of hypotheses. A larger issue remains, however. We can scarcely say, indeed, as Dr. Slop remarked to Corporal Trim on a celebrated occa sion, "'Tis only a hypothesis, honest man. There's not a word of truth in it." A hypothesis claims to be probably true. But the general question of the relations between truth and intellectual economy raises still more funda mental problems than any considered hitherto. On this larger issue there is a strongly marked an tithesis in current philosophizing. On the one hand, it is common to find express statements to the effect that some particular theory is brought forward because it is simpler than its rivals, and not because it is therefore truer. It has the justification of a policy, not of a creed. On the other hand, truth itself is often defined as a species of intellectual convenience. The stock example in connection with the former con tention is the Copernican theory. Copernicus put forward the theory of his De Revolutionibus ostensibly as a mere hypothesis to simplify the task of saving the appearances. This device, however, was common in his time, and, indeed, was necessary for those who desired to live at peace with the Church. It is unlikely, therefore, that he regarded his conclusion as only an ingenious speculation. If he did, it is fair to conjecture that the grounds for his diffidence lay in the fact that the new hypothesis itself did not save the appearances without some cumbrousness and inexactitude. The principal reason for this, as modern readers can see, is that the retention by Copernicus of the postulate of uni form circular motion involved him in unnecessary difficul ties and required him to presuppose some of the epicyclical machinery of Hipparchus and of Ptolemy's Almagest. However that may be, Copernicus laid the foundation of the new theory securely in his proof of the relativity of</page><page sequence="16">336 THE MONIST. observable motion. When this had been done, the common sense of mankind began to believe not merely in the sim plicity but in the truth of the theory. This seems eminently reasonable, since the inductive problem itself may very well be defined as the endeavor to discover the principles which, with the fewest possible assumptions, suffice to save the appearances. Accordingly, if induction yields truth it seems necessary to assume at least that an explanation of this kind which is simpler than some other is also more probably true. To affirm that any suggested explanation ty true simpliciter is, of course, another matter. At the same time, there is a serious difficulty even in this qualified statement. It seems to be plain that among formally correct demonstrations of the same conclusion in mathematics or in formal logic, one may be simpler than another while both must be equally true, just because both are true. More generally, in the formal deduction of pure mathematics or symbolic logic there is a choice of sets of primitive propositions from which the system itself may be deduced. While there may be greater convenience and elegance in choosing one of these sets of primitive propo sitions in preference to the others, there can scarcely be any difference in respect of truth. It is true that part of the difficulty thus arising may be surmounted readily enough. When Schopenhauer com plained that many of Euclid's demonstrations were only conjuring tricks, he meant, presumably, that Euclid had recourse to special artifices and minor principles in his proofs although these artifices really depended upon more general ones. The difficulty, in fact, would be overcome if there were only one set of ultimate general principles upon which all others depended; but this solution is plainly in adequate if there are alternative sets of such fundamental propositions. The same conclusion follows with reference</page><page sequence="17">THE LAW OF PARSIMONY. 337 to any system of scientific concepts. Mach11 remarks, very truly, that in all sciences a formal stage of development must succeed the deductive stage, since the principles as sumed from time to time during the growth of the science must be revised and clarified and shown to be parts of a single harmonious elegant system. If, however, this formal development may take place on alternative lines, it does not seem possible to claim greater truth for the simpler system. The contention that all intellectual thinking (and, ulti mately, truth itself) is nothing but an economical con trivance, requires more elaborate consideration since there are so many different ways of interpreting it. The most usual way of putting the case, is to affirm that thinking consists essentially in the use of symbols, and that symbols are merely abbreviated substitutes for facts. This is the substance of Mach's arguments.12 Lan guage, he says, is but an economic contrivance. Concepts are only compendious symbols for a fluid mass of fact. The concept of a "thing," for instance, is an abbreviated sign for a compound set of sensations of relative fixity. The concept of cause and effect is the selection of what purports to be a recurrent process in nature, although the fact that nature is present only once in any event shows that there can be no real recurrence. Similarly the laws of nature are short simple formulas standing for a multitude of facts. Finally, mathematics, the great instrument of the sciences, is itself the economy of counting; and counting is an econ omy. These arguments are plausible until they are examined, but examination reveals a fatal weakness in their lax use of the term "symbol." Mach's reference to language, and the rest of his argument, suggest that he means by a 11 The Science of Mechanics, p. 421. 12 See, e. g., The Science of Mechanics, pp. 481ff.</page><page sequence="18">338 THE MONIST, "symbol" the conventional sounds of oral communication or the marks on paper that constitute a mathematical nota tion. It is plain, however, that thinking does not consist in making these noises or marks. These are only a device for expressing the thinker's meaning. What, then, is the meaning expressed in these ways? The answer usually given is that a thinker's meaning is a series of concepts which, in their turn, symbolize or refer to certain facts. The problem turns, therefore, on the interpretation of concepts, and here also many am biguities lurk. A concept is sometimes described as an abstraction from the facts, as if it were a residuum ex tracted or distilled from them. Again, it is sometimes described as a schematic mental image which can be used as a substitute for the facts. It is clear, however, that neither of these descriptions is adequate. If a condensed extract from the facts could, by any ingenuity, be con ceived to stand for the rest of them, this would only be possible if both were instances of a common universal, and if a truncated or schematic psychological image (sup posing such a thing to exist) stands for a class of objects, the reason again must be that this image exemplifies a universal term or relation which holds of the objects. In the latter case the image is a pictorial substitute for thought. But there can be no signification except through universals, and what is usually called a concept is nothing but the universal itself. True intellectual thinking is the discovery of universals which hold of particulars, and the universals so discovered are not psychological artifacts and are not a whit less objective or a whit more arbitrary than particular existent facts. Sometimes, however, an attempt is made to parry this argument by interpreting concepts or universals m a dif ferent fashion. Knowledge, instead of being regarded as a process of discovery, is said to be a kind of organization,</page><page sequence="19">THE LAW OF PARSIMONY. 339 and universals are but a means of organizing experience. The goal of thinking, according to this theory, is the at tainment of harmony between intellectual processes and sense experience; and this harmony presupposes a certain simplicity in the principles according to which the intellect works de facto. This argument itself has different meanings according to the philosophy of the users of it. The most obvious interpretation is the psychological one chosen by the prag matists. According to this view the harmony desired in science is only psychological harmony between two classes of mental facts, sensations and intellectual processes. It is a kind of psychological convenience. This statement, however, plainly requires a definition of the particular kind of harmony which is sought in logical thinking, since there are several alternative ways of attaining psychological harmony. Psychological harmony, indeed, may be reached com paratively easily. The constitution of our minds has seen to that. Most people obtain it in these matters by com bining association, hearsay evidence, and emotions with, here and there, a little dose of thinking. Indeed, the most convenient way of dealing with recalcitrant phenomena or with contradictions in points of theory is usually to forget them. This is the course adopted by ninety-nine minds out of a hundred, and it often works well enough although it shuts the door to all discovery and to any real advance even in matters of practice. How is it at all convenient to ponder over a trifling difficulty of forty seconds in a century in the case of the perihelion of Mercury or to reflect deeply on the absence of shifting of interference bands in the Michelson-Morley experiment? The motive for debating these problems is the desire for understanding, not the desire for convenience. The scientific mind, in a word, differs from other minds precisely because it finds</page><page sequence="20">340 THE MONIST, grounds for inconvenience and worry where the others find none. In the long run, it is true, the sustained reflec tion on these inconvenient problems may lead to greater convenience in the way of clear thinking and control over nature than the complacent blindness of common sense. But this is not the psychological motive for the investiga tion. That motive is truth and not ease. A similar conclusion follows when this harmony of ex perience is interpreted in the very different fashion which such writers as Mr. Bradley have made familiar. It is tacitly presupposed in these theories that the harmony of experience is of a logical type, even if, as in the metaphy ics of Plotinus, Spinoza, or Mr. Bosanquet, the work of the logical intellect must be superseded, "in the end," by the more comprehensive and satisfying unity of intuition or mysticism. According to this metaphysic, it is true, our minds are only fragments of a cosmic whole, so that it is impossible to argue directly from the facts of human psychology to that cosmic ideal which is also the truth. On the other hand, the only clue to the nature of the Ab solute is human experience "at its best"; and the phrase "at its best" in this connection must mean "at the most stringent level of logic." The harmony in question, there fore, is a very special sort of harmony. None the less, a metaphysical basis for the law of econ omy would seem to be established if either of the above theories could be accepted. If truth consists in a particular kind of harmony of experience, and if concepts are par ticular ways of organizing experience with simplicity as part of their essence, then the law of economy is part of the being of truth. It would be necessary, indeed, for Mach or the pragmatists carefully to distinguish the sort of organization which we call logical thinking from other species of mental organization such as sentiment or asso ciation. The Absolutists, also, would require to define</page><page sequence="21">THE LAW OF PARSIMONY. 341 more narrowly what particular species of harmony it is which gives legitimate intellectual satisfaction. But the cosmic experience which, according to them, contains the whole truth, of which scientific generalizations are only faint adumbrations, must, one would suppose, be consti tuted according to certain organizing principles of supreme generality which are simple in outline and few in number. In our experience these are, par excellence, the organizing principles of our private worlds. They must also be pre sumed to be the organizing principles of that all-inclusive world in which science itself has its being. There is an ultimate obstacle, however, in the way of accepting all such theories. The discovery of truth, it may be admitted, gives satisfaction and consequently indicates^ the presence of a certain psychological harmony. But this satisfaction is really due to the finality of the discovery. That is found which was sought, and the mind can rest in its discovery and gain confidence in its further powers of advancing. This harmony, then, is of quite a peculiar sort, and it presupposes the belief that a discovery has really been made. Truth is found and not manufactured. The same argument holds of mental organization. The knowing mind must be regarded as an instrument capable of discovering a truth which in the last resort is simply given to it. This truth, however, is not given to it without infinite pains and labor, and the organization of the mind is the laborious process which the mind requires in order to attain the truth. The mind cannot ascertain the char acter of its objects without the organization of thought. It does not matter essentially whether these objects, in particu lar cases, are mental or not. The knowing mind has to dis cover the characteristics of sense-data in the same way as it has to discover anything else, and nothing that is known is a product of the knowing of it. The thinker, then, has to organize his mind in such way as to make discovery</page><page sequence="22">34* THE MONIST. possible, and, in particular, to dwell upon, hold fast to, and follow up those universal principles and relationships which enable him to comprehend a multitude of particulars. Such universals are not psychological constructs or psycho logical forces. They are as objective as any particulars What we ought to do is to organize our minds in order to keep the right principles in view, and to discover more and more of their nature. If these contentions are sound, it is very difficult, in deed, to find a metaphysical basis for any form of the law of economy, and the natural inference is certainly that the law is only a precept indicating the path of wisdom. No doubt there is a certain connection between simplicity and any true propositions which imply generalization or imply that a universal rule holds of a multitude of instances. On the other hand, the significance and importance of sim plicity for us seems to be much greater than its significance for the world. Things are what they are in all their wealth of detail. Why, then, should the truth of things be less subtle ? Thus it seems plain common sense to urge that there can be no a priori law to the effect that either a thing or the truth about it is simple. Is the fact of the matter anything more than the truism that the principles which we are capable of apprehending must be simple, and that we, in our own interests, should try to keep to the simplest of them? This position rests on strong ground. The complexity of the universe can never be simplified out of existence. It remains on our hands always. We may discover certain laws of connection running through it, but these are only a small selection from its total character. It pays us to attend to these laws since no others are of any use to us. But it would be the veriest anthropomorphism to make our advantage a criterion of the character of true being. It is conceivable, therefore, that the law of economy is neither</page><page sequence="23">THE LAW OF PARSIMONY. 343 more nor less than a rule of direction stating that we should always select the simplest of any general propositions which may be true and ascertainable, since it is these truths only that are likely to aid the mind in making further discov eries. This rule shows the path of wisdom in view of the limited powers and scope of the mind. On the other hand, there is at least a possibility that this conclusion exaggerates the limitations of the human intellect, and that its very modesty leads to a sort of neuras thenic impotence instead of a structural one. The pre supposition of the argument is that certain truths, both universal and particular, can be discovered, and it is scarcely doubtful that there is a fundamental order of precedence in the kingdom of knowable truths. The laws of logic, for example, take precedence of all others, and many humble generalizations must give the pas to the law of gravitation or to the conservation of energy. If, then, all truth is discovery, it is hard to suppose that this dis covery should have preeminent importance in the nature of things, or that it should indicate nothing except the limi tations of human minds. Would there not be a hierarchy of truths even for an omniscient knower, and would not the fundamental truths in this hierarchy be also simple? Is it conceivable, for instance, that the laws of logic would be less fundamental for such a being than they are for us? It may be a biological accident that the logical intellect is capable of apprehending the truth of things in any meas ure. But this accident of evolution, if it is one, entails consequences ; and if human beings can really understand at all, it is hard to suppose that the simplicity which is essential to the understanding has no genuine counterpart in reality. The fact that we can understand indicates the contrary, whatever the history of this power of compre hension may have been. On the other hand, this general conclusion can scarcely be used to decide particular cases,</page><page sequence="24">344 THE MONIST. and even the tentative suggestion that there must be an essence of reality, and that this essence must be capable of being resolved into a limited number of supremely gen eral propositions from which the minor ones can be deduced, seems to go distinctly further than the evidence requires. The laws of logic, indeed, must be judged to occupy a unique position in reality as well as in thought, but none of the specific facts of existence can be deduced from them alone. JOHN LAIRD.
