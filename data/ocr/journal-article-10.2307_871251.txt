Paris (Paul Hartmann, distributed by F. de Nobele), ?6. This important picture-book - for it is primarily a picture-book - is a companion to M. Devinoy's Le Siege en France, reviewed in these columns two years ago.' As in its predecessor, the photographs are of high quality, large-scale details of many con- structional features are shown, and the illustrations are mostly of unfamiliar pieces from French private collections or the Musle des Arts Decoratifs. They range from the medieval Pupitre de Sainte Radegonde from Poitiers down to examples of art nouveau, but, as might be expected, two- -thirds of the illustrations are of eighteenth- century pieces, for that period witnessed the apotheosis of the meuble leger. The larger sorts of furniture, the buffet, the cupboard, or the chest, meet perman- ent needs of civilized mankind and change their forms slowly, but the small piece is the true mirror of the manners of its period, for it is generally developed to satisfy the requirements of a passing fashion. Early in Louis XV's reign smaller rooms came into vogue. By mid-century Cochin had formu- lated the ironical rule, 'plus la personne sera elevee en dignite, plus son appartement sera petit'. This, and the rapidly-changing occupations of the fashionable society of eighteenth- century Paris, gave rise to numerous types of compact multifunctional furniture, bureaux-toilette, bonheurs-du-jour, ath6niennes (which could be used as a plant pot, a wash-hand-basin, a candelabrum, an in- cense burner, or merely as a piece of modish neo-grecque decoration), whose names are so baffling in contemporary inventories. 'Je crois que l'inventaire de notre mobilier Itonnerait un ancien s'il revenait au monde. La langue des huissiers-priseurs qui savent les noms de cette foule immense de superfluitis est une langue trWs ditaillie, tres riche, et trWs inconnue aux pauvres', exclaimed Mercier. Even Ruobo, the most articulate of eighteenth- century cabinet-makers, admits himself un- able to explain certain fashionable names like 'chaise en cabriolet'. To the interpreta- tion to this bewildering vocabulary, M. Guillaume Janneau brings the experience of a life spent in the Mobilier National. His fifty-page introduction is packed with learning drawn from early inventories, sale catalogues, and a wide acquaintance with literary sources. Thus he is able for the first time to define exactly the charac- ter of the vuide-poche (which performed more functions than its name implies), the ecran a la Montagnard, the table d l'anglaise, and the multifarious varieties of toilettes which played so important a part in the public, as well as private, life of an eighteenth-century society lady. But even he confesses to having been defeated by the designations 'table en mouchoir' and 'table en la Mahon'. M. Janneau is especially 1 Vol.xcII, [i95I], p.Io8. THE LITERATURE OF ART illuminating on the dating of certain fashions such as the constantly varying types of gaming table or the protean changes of the commode, though he has been misled into ante-dating to 1756 the first use of Sevres porcelain plaques for the decoration of furniture. He bases his thesis on a table in the Wallace Collection (xix.I2); unfortunately its porcelain top not only bears a false date-letter but is, in fact, merely a soup-plate adapted to its purpose rather than made specifically for furniture decoration. Three other tables in the same collection bear porcelain plaques dated 1759, I759, and 1760 res- pectively and seem to be the earliest known examples of this highly anti-functional type of furniture decoration, though an examination of the archives of the Sevres Manufactory might prove illuminating on this point. The author brings to light some little- known facts on the relationship between furniture styles in France and England. All through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries these were closer than is generally supposed, and from quite early in the eighteenth century complaints against the large-scale importation of French furniture were voiced in the English Press. But the traffic was not all in one direction. It is, for example, interesting to learn that tables with flaps and gate-legs on the English model were introduced into France during Louis XIV's wars, when commercial rela- tions with this country were officially inter- rupted, and the extendible dining-table (as well as other English appurtenances of the dining-room) became fashionable in Paris under the designation table d I'anglaise during the American War of Indepen- dence, just when the English were particu- larly unpopular. One of M. Devinoy's plates shows a Louis XVI table-secritaire entirely veneered with straw-work marquetry. The French are known to have brought this technique to a very high pitch of excellence. Ex- amples of this fragile work are rare and little is known of the craftsmen working in the medium, though a retired huntsman, Delasson, earned a reputation for thi fine furniture he decorated in this manner be- tween 1768 and 1790. One or more prac- titioners of this technique must have been amongst the French prisoners-of-war con- fined in the Norman Cross camp from 1797 to 1816. It was doubtless they who produced the straw boxes, etc., which are still occasionally to be found and which are popularly (and erroneously) supposed to have been the mere idle pastime of any prisoner of the Napoleonic wars willing to sacrifice his straw palliasse to their produc- tion. The finest collection of these things is now in the nearby Peterborough Museum; they are to be distinguished from their English equivalent by their superiority of craftsmanship and the way their decora- tion almost always follows Louis XVI models very closely. The only serious criticism to be made of this fascinating book is that M. Janneau's introduction hardly ever refers to furniture shown in M. Devinoy's plates. To make full use of his learned text it must be read in a reference library exceptionally well- furnished with illustrated sale and museum catalogues. F. J. B. WATSON The Meaning of China's Most Ancient Art. By A. Bulling. 150 pp. (79 figs.)+ viii pl. Leiden (E. J. Brill), 34 guilders. This intriguing book sets out to discover the meaning of a selected group of motifs on the Kansu painted vases - namely circles and spirals, triangles, lozenge pat- terns, and tree and anthropomorphic patterns. Dr Bulling's method consists in working from the known to the unknown - that is, using classical and mythological texts to interpret the designs on the bronzes and reliefs of the historical periods of Shang, Chou, and Han, then finding paral- lels to these motifs on the Kansu vases and transferring the meanings arrived at to the interpretation of these earlier designs. The first condition for the success of this method is, of course, that the historical and cul- tural link between Neolithic Kansu and these later periods be firmly established. The writer apparently considers it un- necessary to demonstrate this connexion, for the question is nowhere raised. That the patterns on the vases had definite meanings seems certain, and on this point Dr Bulling is convincing. But that they meant the same things to the Stone Age people of Pan-shan as they did to the rela- tively sophisticated population of Anyang and Loyang is highly debatable, and can- not simply be assumed. And what did they mean? Here' the author confidently states, 'if the ancient patterns of pottery had any meaning at all, it was most likely connec- ted with cosmography, the orbit of hea- venly bodies and with the calendar. This is supported, to a certain extent, by pas- sages in ancient Chinese literature. The earliest symbols referred to in texts are all more or less connected with the calendar, stars and planets'. The main body of the book is devoted to a discussion of the motifs in the light of this interpretation, for which there is certainly some support. But although Neolithic man in North China was presumably groping towards an awareness ofthe movements of the heavenly bodies, we cannot assume that this was his main preoccupation. Fertility cults and hunting magic, neither of which are con- sidered as possible clues, must have been at least as important. It is possible that this dangerous method of research might have succeeded if it were based on a very cau- tious use of what little evidence can be substantiated; but unfortunately the argu- ment is too often built up on a framework of rickety logic, of which one example must suffice. On p.78 ff. lozenge patterns are discussed, and the following gives the gist of the argument: the lozenge is filled with concentric lines (i.e. smaller lozenges), 'this 342</page></plain_text>
