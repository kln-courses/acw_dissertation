C. Adams, P. Glasner, and H. Rothman-Science and Technology Policy Centre, Bristol Polytechnic Several recent science policy reports have discussed the arguments for govern- mental support for strategic research (ABRC 1985; Irvine and Martin 1984; Dickson 1984; Rothman 1985; ACARD 1986) and many are clear that the identification and support of exploitable areas of science are now an "investment" decision that can no longer be left simply to peer review. This then raises questions about the nature of the "understandings" of science possessed by the members of the various groups that will become involved in such a process. This ESRC-funded project is inves- tigating the understandings found at various levels in two different scientific fields: protein engineering and marine science. The results discussed in this paper focus on protein engineering and are based upon wide-ranging interviews with a range of individuals such as civil servants, research funding agency officials, research and development managers, and in- dustrialists as well as scientists supported either through AFRC or under the um- brella of SERC. The AFRC has sought to commercialize its fundings through the Agricultural Genetics Company, a "preferred company." SERC uses a network of collaboration and information exchange called the Protein Engineering Club, which comprises four industrial groups, namely: Celltech, ICI, Glaxo, and Sturge/RTZ, together with several academic institutions (mainly universities). A preliminary analysis of the findings suggests that importance needs to be attached to the social location of the decision maker responsible for the identification of strategic research areas in this field, and that there are indeed widely varied differences in their public understandings of science. 83</page><page sequence="2">84 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values "For an Anthropology of Technics." Madeleine Akrich- Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation, Ecole des Mines de Paris A technical object can no more be defined as a physical apparatus than as a col- lection of uses to which this apparatus is "put"; it must be defined quite precisely as the relationship that is constructed between these two terms-it is a material device for social or human action. Through our reference to anthropology, we propose to reverse the tables and to show how technical objects, through their configuration, play an integral part in the construction of culture, in the definition and stabilization of politics, economics, social relations, and even morals. The consequence of all this is that the study of technology is not at the margins of general sociology, but is one of the central topics where we can currently observe a great variety of transformations affecting the world in which we live: We can't leave the objects at the periphery of our mental universe, because they continually interact with us in daily life. One of the central purposes of this paper is to show that the repertoire describ- ing the various actions of technical objects is not a restricted one, but one coexten- sive with the repertoire of human action. We will also argue that the work of in- novators or inventors of technologies can be described as a series of choices be- tween what part of the job should be left to the initiative of human actors and what part should be delegated to the machine itself. The paper will draw on various case studies carried out in developing countries that deal with several contrasting situations. Among the points we will probably develop, there figure -the setting of new social relations (and their economization); the various modes of managing solidarity (inside the technical object or outside it in the social organization); -the way new technologies can produce a new economic deal and reorganize the evaluation of costs and the comparison between the various alternatives; and, -the way technologies can make politics and underwrite moral positions. "Openings and Opportunities in the 1990s: STS and the Radical Transfor- mation of Technological Education." David Albury-Science and Tech- nology Studies Unit, North East London Polytechnic For many STS practitioners, especially in Britain, the end of the 1980s appears to be a period of decline and retrenchment. This is hardly surprising. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, STS came to be dominated to a considerable extent by the aim of humanizing allegedly barbarian scientists. As the liberal humanist/social democratic consensus that underpinned particularly English education came under</page><page sequence="3">Abstracts 85 sustained criticism from a new, narrowly conceived utilitarianism, STS was especially vulnerable. Four sets of developments in the 1970s and 1980s have provided opportunities, however, though little recognized, for the growth of a transformed STS as an area of teaching and research. This paper discusses the developments, examines the failure to grasp the opportunities, and describes an attempt at North East London Polytechnic to devise forms of undergraduate and continuing education that respond to the opportunities. Opportunities "The entrepreneurial spirit." Industrialists, politicians and academics, in their search for Britain's lack of entrepreneurialism and their desire to foster a climate of enterprise, have been forced to replace crude technological determinist models with a recognition of the complex of cultural and social forces that condition innovation. "People problems." This general recognition is mirrored at the level of the firm or organization, where managers commonly state that their problems of choosing and implementing new technologies were not simply, or centrally, technological but economic, organizational, and attitudinal. (Not a startling revelation to STS and science policy researchers.) "The future belongs to . . ." In Britain, there is a vigorous discussion, indeed a cultural struggle, over visions of the future. The consensus that reduced politics to wrangles about the best means to achieve uncontested ends has been replaced with a government whose defined goal-society "as it might be"-is used to justify otherwise unpalatable measures. At the heart of these discussions are positionings of new technologies-especially information and communications technologies- and of people's relationship to them. Student demand. Although resources for higher education have been heavily restricted, the number of student places in science and technology have been con- siderably expanded. Many of the newly created places have remained unfilled, however, in part because of cultural factors, anxieties about the possibly "antisocial" potentials of some scientific and technological developments, and the masculine image of science and technology. Openings These developments all provide openings for studies of science and technology. It is thus paradoxical that, at this time, STS appears to be at its weakest. A major reason for this is that, for several years, many STS practitioners allowed their critical stance to be read as "antiscience" thus refusing an engagement with the pleasures and positive benefits that individuals and organizations experienced as being associated with the development of science and technology. STS need not choose between the "antiscientific" and the technocratic but could become the pluralistic occupation of the spaces created by the interplay of the determinants and implica- tions of the new technologies.</page><page sequence="4">86 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values In the light of the above considerations, staff at NELP developed the BSc (Hons) New Technology (Interdisciplinary Studies). This degree takes as its focus the in- novation process and treats equally the acquisition of skills in, and critical understand- ing of, the technological, cultural, institutional, economic, and social aspects of the process. The degree aims not to polarize the vocational and the critical but to maintain a creative tension between the two. "Schools of Thought vs. Fields: The Case of Early 20th Century Linguistics." Olga Amsterdamska-Department of Science Dynamics, University of Amsterdam The concept of schools of thought has a long tradition in the history and soci- ology of science, and yet, like disciplines, specialties, and fields, schools of thought are difficult to define with the precision necessary for comparative studies. Most attempts to define and describe schools have focused on their internal character- istics-intellectual coherence, the degree of intellectual closure, role of the leader, size, and so on. It is, however, also possible to define schools not in terms of their internal characteristics, but rather in terms of their relation to fields within which they function. From such a perspective, schools appear as groups of scholars or scientists united in their common divergence, both cognitive and social, from other schools in the field, or from the field as a whole. When scientific fields are defined in terms of competition for reputations (a com- petition both for the authority to define knowledge goals and procedures and for access to resources), a formation of a school of thought can be seen as a particular strategy of participation in such a competition. We can also expect that the character of this strategy will depend on such factors as the reputational structure of the field, its national and international organization, and the institutional location of school members. The paper focuses on a comparison of two roughly contemporary schools of linguistics-the Geneva structuralists and the neo-Idealists-which developed diametrically opposed theories of language and distinct conceptions of linguistics as a discipline. It is argued that differences in the institutional location of the two schools, which structured their strategies of competition for reputations, can also help us to account for the cognitive differences between them. "Dimensions of Citation Analysis." Olga Amsterdamska and Loet Leydesdorff-Department of Science Dynamics, University of Amsterdam The use of citation analyses both in science policy contexts and in the social studies of science has prompted numerous calls for a theory of citation. It has been</page><page sequence="5">Abstracts 87 generally assumed that to use citations as indicators of importance or impact of ar- ticles, of the quality of researchers, or of social relations in a given field of science, it is necessary to provide an account of why scientists cite particular texts in par- ticular contexts. A citation in a text indicates not only a link between the citing author and the cited text, however, but also establishes links between two texts (for example, by establishing a symbolic or argumentative connection or by citing the text for rhetorical purposes); between two authors (for example, as members of the same area of inquiry); and between the cited author and the citing text (insofar, for example, as the citation is interpreted as a reward for the person being cited). These four modes lead to different questions and pose different requirements on the theory of citation. In a recent study, we showed that if citations are examined as links between texts, one can distinguish a number of distinct cognitive functions they fulfill as they serve to integrate various knowledge claims into specific evidential contexts. (Amsterdamska and Leydesdorff, in press). This mode of analysis, however, tells us nothing of the motives of authors who choose to cite a given paper in a particular context or about the social functions and determinants of citations. In order to ex- amine these aspects of the citation practice in greater detail, we have conducted a questionnaire among authors citing these same papers. The paper examines the results of this questionnaire, analyzing the reasons given by scientists for citing particular papers. The paper will conclude with an analysis of the consequences of our findings for a theory of citation and for the use of cita- tions as indicators in science studies. Reference 0. Amsterdamska and L.

"The Post-Hegemonic Era in Science and Technology Cooperation: Re- cent Trends in the International Relations of Science." Vittorio Ancarani -Dipartimento di Scienze sociali, Universita di Torino -After World War II, the leading role of the United States in the international S&amp;T system greatly fostered patterns of cooperation. Stability, growing certainty, and control of the behavior of the partners were assured under the American leader- ship, and the United States was also able to bear the burden of the extra cost of international cooperation. Following the partial decline of the U.S. role and hegemony in world affairs and after the oil crisis (1973), priorities in national science policies changed following a rising concern about the immediate problems of unemployment, inflation, and slow growth in industrialized countries. S&amp;T for increased international industrial</page><page sequence="6">88 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values competitiveness is being emphasized as an objective in most countries, the United States included. -Growing difficulties and strains in international relations and cooperation in S&amp;T seem to foster a recent revival and new commitment to state-centered "realistic" views of S&amp;T international relations. Political realists have long thought that inter- national relations are based on international power structures and conflicts of in- terests among states. According to this view, order and cooperation may be better explained as occurring inside an alliance and under conditions of a dominant hegemonic power. A consequence is that the loss of these conditions produces a situation in which conflicting interests overcome cooperative efforts in international affairs. -Are realistic assumptions adequate to understand fully recent trends in inter- national S&amp;T relations? The purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate that (1) even if this perspective seems tempting in exploring a wide range of phenomena, its crude application is insufficient and also misleading, and that (2) even in a post- hegemonic era, the importance of cooperation should be highly valued rather than underrated. The paper assumes also that the obstacles and resistance stemming from the dominant state-centered view in international relations do affect government capabilities to understand fully national science advantages and appropriate policies in international science cooperation and competition. "Scientific Community or Mafia? On Some Neglected Forms of Scientific Self-Organization and Their Theoretical Relevance." Helmut M. Artus-/Z Social- Wissenschaften From its very beginning, the sociology of science has suffered from an epistemological preoccupation that has been affecting its whole thinking and re- searching until now. Notably, the scientific community has never been conceptualized as a really social group, but as a group of persons aiming only at the creation, communication, and evaluation of knowledge. Thus a completely idealized picture of science was drawn, much closer to epistemology than to scientific reality. In scientific everyday life, however, everyone knows informal groups that more resemble cliques or gangs than those sublime discursive communities or invisible colleges theory is talking about. My paper is dedicated to the description of such groups and the analysis of their impacts on scientific structures and processes. I shall try to prove that, aside from their cognitive orientation, such scientific groups aim at more or less nonscientific benefits (career, scientific, political or ideological influence, power, money, and so on). The most interesting group is what I call a "(scientific) mafia": a small but highly interdependent group of scientists with the same paradigmatic and institu- tional background, who have conquered a lot of positions in boards and committees</page><page sequence="7">90 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values empirical and objective, while scholarship cultivates reason and critical thought. Scholars produce discourse. Scientists produce information. But when observations are imprecise, inconsistent, or inconclusive, discourse becomes more important. Because their observations and predictions are imprecise, social scientists buttress their research with traditional scholarship. Thus social sciences are attempting to satisfy the requirements of both science and scholarship. In this paper, I compare the manuscript review processes used by journals in science, social science, and the arts. Data were collected from manuscripts sub- mitted to three journals. I compared decision-making structures and manuscript format (for example, length of manuscript and use of a standard organizational for- mat). The rejection rate was higher for the social science journal than for either the physical science journal or the journal of the arts. Social science manuscripts were sent to more referees, received more commentary from referees, and were revised more often prior to eventual publication. There were more similarities be- tween the decision structure of the arts journal and the science journal. While the format of the social science journal was like the organizational form of the science journal, it was similar to the arts journal in length and number of references. I con- clude that the higher rejection rate in social science is partially a consequence of trying to satisfy two traditions of inquiry: science and scholarship. "Science and Its Differences." Andrew Barry- Center for Research into Innovation, Brunel University In the last decade, sociologists have paid close attention to the detailed practices of scientific work, the structure of scientific texts, and the negotiations involved in the resolution of scientific controversies. They have been able to bring into ques- tion many widely held distinctions between science and its "others." No longer is it straightforward to counterpose scientific and literary texts, logical and rhetorical arguments, or scientific controversies and political struggles. Scientific work ap- pears to be a special form of cultural practice and a peculiarly effective political tactic. While these insights are of considerable significance, it is argued that they have been achieved at a cost. Drawing upon a study of the development of space research in Britain, it is suggested that two neglects in recent work are notable. -Whereas earlier social studies of science were able to provide analysis of the relationship between scientific developments and social and economic transforma- tions, contemporary sociologists are more cautious. Recent sociologists of scien- tific knowledge have been largely unconcerned with the historical and cultural specificity of different research activities. -While programmatic statements by sociologists of science in recent years have often stressed the importance of an attention to the "content" of scientific knowledge, it is argued that this promise has been only half-fulfilled. Although it has been possible to demonstrate the construction of individual scientific facts in particular locations,</page><page sequence="8">Abstracts 89 controlling research institutes, journals, and scientific societies, and consulting research funding organizations as well as political institutions and so on, thus con- siderably influencing science as well as science and research politics, political plan- ning, and science transfer, and controlling distribution and utilization of research funds. The decisive kick is that such "mafias" are no longer dominated by ideas such as scientific rationality or appropriate goal orientation but by social relationships; social, political, and personal interests; and by the idea of optimizing group benefits of the "mafia". "Latin American Scientists Facing Production." Rigas Arvanitas-Orstom - Cendes Scientists in Latin America are overwhelmingly preoccupied by applications of research. This is not a new phenomenon. What is new is that scientists are more aware of it, although it is not clear what type of contacts should be created between academia and production. This paper is intended to show-with precise examples in agricultural research and food processing research-the many reasons explaining the absence of contacts between science and production. It draws heavily on empirical findings of research done in Venezuela in agricultural sciences and food science. Moreover, it looks at both sides of the problem, that is, scientists and industrial entrepreneurs. It also compares similar results from other studies in Latin America, mainly Colombia and Mexico. Most of the research on this topic tries to identify the factors affecting the rela- tionship between science and production, or the reasons of success in innovation. An alternative approach is to pinpoint how a market is created, that is, how the social actors construct needs and ways to satisfy them. This is a historical and in- stitutional process by which a network of relations is created. Development out of applied science is possible when this network exists. A theoretical framework is proposed that is halfway between the management sciences and economics, on one side, and the sociology of science, on the other side. It tries to show the roots of this networking necessary for development and for (successful or not) application of science. "Scholarship and Science: A Comparison of Manuscript Review in Science, Social Science and the Arts." Von Bakanic- University of Southern Mississippi Science and scholarship are two respected forms of inquiry, but they are not synonymous. Although they are not mutually exclusive, science endeavors to be</page><page sequence="9">92 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values The groups did not differ on the quality of their Ph.D. training institution. They differed, however, on two other career experience background variables: Doubletons and team players were currently employed in departments with stronger reputa- tional ratings; team leaders made significantly more career job moves than others. The groups also differed on career outcome variables. Team leaders, team players, and doubletons had significantly more publications during their careers than those with other career authorship patterns. The groups also differed on time to promo- tion to associate professor and full professor ranks. Team players and team leaders were more likely than others to be listed in Who's Who. These differences in career authorship styles are discussed in relation to science and academic reward and evaluation systems. Possible differences are proposed be- tween various fields and disciplines in the relative frequency of the various author- ship styles. The typology is advocated for use in future research to understand better questions related to the growth in collaboration in the scientific and scholarly enterprise. "How Natural Philosophers Can Cooperate: The Literary Technology of Coordinated Investigation in Joseph Priestley's History and Present State of Electricity (1767)." Charles Bazerman--Baruch College, CUNY Recent studies of scientific rhetoric have foregrounded the agonistic struggle played out over scientific texts. Contemporary rhetoric of science, however, also employs a number of features that foster cooperation in the communal research endeavor and coordination of results. We can gain some insight into cooperative rhetorical strategies by studying an early text of Joseph Priestley, a self-conscious innovator in scientific language motivated by a millenarian view of historical progress. In The History and Present State of Electricity, Priestley presents an unusual combination of material and employs a variety of rhetorical strategies aimed at foster- ing the communal work in this field rather than advancing a particular theoretical position. His presentation attempts to make available and to codify the accumulated experience of all investigators, the established propositions of electrical phenomena, the state of the art in the construction of electrical apparatus, and craft knowledge in carrying out experiments. He offers ways of considering theories to diffuse ex- cessive allegiance that hinders new discovery while still recognizing the theory's heuristic role in the generating of knowledge. He also attempts to organize the research front through the formulation of open research questions and relevant knowledge to be investigated. In order to increase work at the research front, he must recruit electricians and give them laboratory experience, in part through amusing demonstration experiments, which he also presents. He also offers some of his own work, presented in what he calls analytic form, as exemplary of the ease of carry- ing out new research and of what he believes the most communally fruitful method of presentation. His self-conscious rhetorical procedures attempt to realize an in-</page><page sequence="10">Abstracts 91 there have been comparatively few attempts to analyze the substantial differences between the content of the sciences. In particular, it is argued that sociologists of science need to consider the significance of aesthetic differences between scientific theories. "Information Retrieval: Bibliographic Information versus Science Policy Information." S. Bauin-SERPIA, Institut pour l'Information Scientifi- que et Technique/CNRS Science studies have been using more and more scientometric methods to achieve different goals. Among those, the use of bibliographic data bases as information layers to address science policy questions is increasing. And then again among the later, clusterization techniques are often used to abstract information drawn from such data bases. The problem of the validity of such methods, although many efforts have been undertaken, remains an open question. The main reason for this seems to lie in the fact that assessment tools have been borrowed from a different discipline that is at the origins of the use of bibliographic data bases: "Information Science," and more precisely, from its subbranch "Information Retrieval." Unfortunately, if the source of data is the same, if one is seeking bibliographic references or trying to assess the strategic situation of a research group, the type of information needed is totally different. Thus if the two systems do share similar features, such as, to some extent, the evaluation of the quality of data, the paradigm descended from information science should never be used as such to assess the validity of scien- tometric methods. In our paper, we intend to review in detail what the differences really are, and try to show how one could finally assess soundly the validity of this type of scientometric method. "Collaborative 'Styles' in American Academic Science and Its Correlates: A Longitudinal Study of Chemists." Alan E. Bayer-Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University-and John C. Smart- University of Illinois at Chicago A sample of 150 career university Ph.D. chemists in the United States was drawn from the Directory of the American Chemical Society; then 25 years of published papers were coded for authorship order and number of authors. Cluster analysis and a priori classification is used to derive a typology of seven career publication profiles: (1) low producers, (2) burnouts, (3) singletons, (4) team leaders, (5) team players, (6) doubletons, and (7) rank and file.</page><page sequence="11">Abstracts 93 tegrated research community that develops a coordinated knowledge yet is founded on an open-ended seeking after new empirical experience. A number of these rhetorical procedures have been incorporated into the modem rhetoric of science and have helped form the field on which the competitive struggles of knowledge- claim assertion have been fought. "Science and Rationality: The Debate on the Principles of the Strong Pro- gramme." Frans A.J. Birrer-Department of Mathematics and Com- puter Science At first sight, the debate about the principles of the Strong Programme primarily seems to be one between science of science and philosophy. When the principles of the Strong Programme are read as beliefs (even as hypothetical beliefs), they seem prone to a lot of serious philosophical objections (this is especially true of the symmetry postulate), which is precisely what philosophers and others have tried to point out. The position of the defenders of the Strong Programme is more am- bivalent: On several occasions, they are coming very close to the suggestion that the principles should indeed be viewed as a foundation of a status almost comparable to that of theoretical constructions in natural science (this is certainly true for Bloor, and hardly less for Barnes); when they respond to critique on the rationality of the principles, however, they simply step aside by pointing out that the principles are merely of heuristic importance. In order to improve our understanding of what is at stake here, a relevant and fruitful opposition can be developed by turning to the action context in which knowledge is embedded. The natural science paradigm is a source of more or less algorithmic prescriptions for action. Social science, on the other hand, much more rarely can give positive advice of algorithmic quality. More often, its advice for action is negative: This action certainly will not lead to the desired result. Without making the mistake of identifying these two types with natural science, respectively, social science as such, there are good reasons for distinguishing between the two types of knowledge-in-context, as the two types correspond to rather distinct, not very compatible orientations. For instance, the "negative" type has a much more pronounced mission in correcting existing procedures and processes. We intend to show that the distinction between the two types of knowledge-in- context-of-action can help us to resynthesize the debate about the principles of the Strong Programme on a different level, where the arguments are no longer incom- patible. An important issue in this new debate will be in which terms practitioners of science of science should discuss what they do. This problem, it will be argued, provides a major task for science of science in the 1990s, and will bring us right to the heart of what presently may be seen as the weakest spot in the science of science: its profound lack of reflexivity. Some lines along which such an enterprise might be undertaken will be pointed out.</page><page sequence="12">94 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values "Science and the Human Genome: Policy Issues in Genetic Intervention in the 1990s." Robert H. Blank- Northern Illinois University Our knowledge of human genetics is exploding, largely the result of new capa- bilities to diagnose and identify genetic disorders. The most rapid developments are with DNA probes to detect natural genetic heterogeneity. Following the discovery of a molecular probe for the Huntington's disease gene in 1983, efforts were inten- sified to find genetic markers for Alzheimer's disease, manic-depression, malig- nant melanoma, and many other conditions. In addition, considerable attention is being directed to the genetic bases of alcoholism, obesity, and susceptibility to a range of environmental factors. The next logical step after testing is gene therapy. Although extensive human therapy is not imminent, active research is under way to develop techniques to correct genetic defects by acting directly on the DNA of the affected person's cells. Ironically, these new capabilities will accentuate the policy issues of genetic in- tervention. When testing leads to aversion or treatment of genetic disease, the issues, although controversial, are reasonably straightforward. When testing involves the identification of heightened risk for particular conditions, however, it is considerably more problematic. As new genetic probes emerge, the demand for accessibility to information derived from such tests will intensify. Once the tests are accepted as legitimate by policymakers, it is likely that legislatures and courts will recognize professional standards of care that incorporate them. This paper examines the policy issues in the move from basic science on the human genome to technological interventions in individuals. Because of the inten- sity and sensitivity of the policy issues raised by human applications of DNA tech- niques, both diagnostic and therapeutic, calls for government regulation will inten- sify. This paper analyzes the state of DNA probes today, projections on where and how fast we are moving, and policy options for the coming decade. "The Motive Structure in Contemporary Polar Science." Ingemar Bohlin- Department of Theory of Science, University of Gothenburg This presentation of an ongoing research project is introduced by a brief discus- sion of different methods by which a study of modem polar science can be carried out. The method that I have chosen to apply is based mainly on political science and science policy studies. My perspective is international, and Arctic as well as Antarctic science is considered. Attention has been focused on institutional motives, a concept that for certain reasons is preferred to "knowledge interests." Such a method makes it possible to relate national research profiles to macro-political struc- tures, and yields results that are politically relevant in two respects. On one hand,</page><page sequence="13">Abstracts 95 my conclusions are useful in a science policy context; on the other, the study is itself political and critical. Six types of motives are discussed: the purely scientific, the political, the eco- nomic, the military, the administrative, and the environmental. Marked differences appear between Antarctic and Arctic science, and between different groups of coun- tries. In Antarctica, the political motive, although strong, to a large extent operates through the purely scientific motive. In the Arctic countries, the economic, military, and administrative motives dominate at the expense of the purely scientific motive, but for a group of non-Arctic nations supporting Arctic science, the situation is analogous to that which prevails in Antarctic science. By distinguishing two dif- ferent types of use to which science is put, which under some circumstances are mutually exclusive, the pattern is explained. In the one case, scientific knowledge is used for some kind of practical purpose; in the other case, science represents a symbolic capital. "The Political Economy of Professionalization: The Birth of the Brazilian Informatics Policy." Antonio Jose J. Botelho-Program in Science, Technology and Society, and Department of Political Science, Massa- chusetts Institute of Technology This paper argues that, over the past two decades, computer professionals in Brazil developed a professional worldview and a set of interests, which shaped both the state's interests and the industrial organization of informatics. It illuminates the formation of technological communities, the pattern of state expansion, and the rela- tionship between expertise, power, and the transformation of politics. The dual processes of professionalization and state expansion are historically constituted through political struggles. The outcome is, on one hand, a function of the efforts of individual actors and their professional institutions to establish and sustain flexible networks of power. On the other, it is a function of the framework of action of the changing political economy. In this context, the centralizing and far-reaching, overarching nature of the Brazilian state capacity in informatics emerges as a result of a struggle between professional groups to define the state's institu- tional interests in a particular political economy. The paper concludes that a key strategy of professional groups is to translate professional expertise into various states of politics: first, into both symbolic and authoritative resources, which help sustain other actors' claims in political strug- gles, and second, into interpretations of contextually critical political economy struc- tures and concepts, and of other actors' interests and ideologies, through the lenses of their own cognitive and professional worldview. At stake in this struggle is the definition of the very possibilities of the transformation of politics, and ultimately the fate of the very process of professionalization.</page><page sequence="14">96 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values It furthermore concludes that a crucial factor in this process, beyond the con- stitution and control of markets, is the control of the institutional arrangements underlying them. In a changing political economy, state elites, in order to sustain their power to assert claims, must constantly expand their basis of legitimacy and authority. This calls for an expansion and redefinition of networks of power into new social areas of activity. This produces new configurations of interests, with an attendant symbolic and practical redefinition of the political economy structure and concepts, supported by professional expertise. "Patent Truths and Well Holes." Geof Bowker--Centre for the Sociology of Innovation In this paper, I will look at the patenting policy of the petrol section of the geophysical prospecting company Schlumberger in the period 1920 to 1940, and how this policy fit in with their general scientific research. Schlumberger provides an interesting example for several reasons. First, the company was wholly depen- dent upon its research results. Further, the field was in constant change over the period studied-this year's basic patent became next year's wastepaper. It becomes apparent that, in this vertiginous atmosphere, patenting was but one of a series of strategies that Schlumberger used to defend its work: In particular, I will locate how and why specific decisions to use different strategies were made and see what the alternatives were. Also, Schlumberger's industrial research was not centered in a given laboratory-as is the case for the canonical examples from the electrical and telephone industries. Experimental work was often carried out in the oil fields by the engineers taking measurements (frequently under the noses of the oil com- panies for whom they worked). Engineers were deliberately integrated into the research process and their independent research was often vital. Finally, all recent major works on industrial science have stressed that patenting has been a key factor in the development of industrial research, but as yet there have been few case studies outside of the large American industrial research laboratories. In particular, Schlumberger fought a long patent battle with Halliburton in the years 1939 to 1941, and I will look in detail at the organization of this battle and its stakes. The theoretical thread uniting my narrative will be the question of the specificity of industrial science: Who in the company decides what research gets done and how, and to what extent are the results achieved published, patented, or hidden? "STS Studies in the General Education of Scientists and Engineers in the 1990s." Charles Boyle-Department of Physical Sciences, Trent Poly- technic That scientists and engineers should be more aware of the social implications of their work is a fundamental belief held by those engaged in STS studies, but</page><page sequence="15">Abstracts 97 these studies form a very broad, complex, and expanding field that draws sustenance from many different disciplines. The science and engineering disciplines are them- selves vast and developing rapidly. This paper is concerned with three types of peren- nial problems that will persist and probably intensify during the 1990s. First, against strong competition for curriculum space from new technical and scientific subjects on the one hand, and business/management studies on the other, how do STS studies establish a niche from which to promote their distinctive perspec- tives on the modem world? Second, what should be taught in the limited time available? What are the basic principles of STS? Should our concern be with a broad coverage of the field or with a more detailed analysis of specialized topics? Third, what methods of teaching/learning are most appropriate for the future? The answers to these questions in the United Kingdom will depend, it is sug- gested, on the nature and intensity of public crises of confidence in the professional competence and sense of responsibility of scientists, technologists, and science policymakers. These crises may arise, on the one hand, from failures to produce effective industrial innovations in the United Kingdom (as compared to successes elsewhere), and, on the other hand, from the unwanted side effects (in both their chronic and acute varieties) of the new technologies. "Mapping of Science by Combined Co-Citation and Word Analysis. I: Structural Aspects." R. R. Braam, H. F. Moed, and A.F.J. van Raan- Science Studies Unit, LISBON-Institute, University of Leiden Combined analysis of co-citation relations and word similarities is used to evaluate structural aspects of co-citation analysis. The central issues are as follows: Is there a sufficient amount of cognitive resemblance within and variance between co-citation clusters to justify the claim that, indeed, different research specialties are identified? And if so, how complete then is the co-citation map? Further, how do these results deviate from results of (a special form of) co-word analysis? We constructed data sets for agriculture-related biochemistry (Chemical Abstracts, 3000 source publica- tions, 1985) and for chemo-reception (Biosis, 1000 publications, 1985 and 1986). References of source publications have been retrieved from ISI/SCI, and were added to these data sets using dedicated software. "Cognitive coherence" within clusters is operationalized by a similarity measure for the indexing terms (words) of individual publications within a cluster compared with a cluster as a whole. "Cognitive resemblance" between clusters is operational- ized by a similarity measure for the indexing terms (words) of clusters as a whole. The above measures are compared to the average co-citation strength within, and between, clusters, respectively. We also investigated possible correlations of co- citation clusters with professional field-classification codes to see whether inter- related clusters represent structures at higher hierarchical levels than specialties. "Completeness" of co-citation clustering is operationalized by a similarity measure for indexing terms (words) of source publications not constituted in any</page><page sequence="16">98 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values cluster, as compared to those in identified clusters. Finally, identified co-citation clusters, in particular topics and sources involved, are compared to co-word clusters. Results will be presented at the conference. "Mapping of Science by Combined Co-Citation and Word Analysis. II: Dynamical Aspects." R. R. Braam, H. F. Moed, and A.F.J. van Raan- Science Studies Unit, LISBON-Institute, University of Leiden A combined analysis of co-citation relations and word similarities is explored in our group to improve the capability of quantitative techniques to map the struc- ture and dynamics of scientific research. In our opinion, a combined analysis of co-citation relations and words, originating from publications citing to co-citation clusters, makes it possible to present a more complete and representative picture of research specialties and their relations in a given year, and also to identify and to link specialties through time. Clusters of one given year, strongly related by both co-citations as well as by high similarity in cognitive content, can be seen as represent- ing parts of the same, larger specialty. Clusters from different years sharing a high percentage of cluster-core publications and having a high similarity in cognitive content can be seen as different phases of the same specialty. For a specialty in Atomic and Molecular Physics (Rydberg Atoms and Molecules), publication data, including indexing terms, and professional field-classification codes, have been retrieved from INSPEC (300 source publications for the period 1974 to 1986, based on an expert's document file). References of these source publica- tions have been retrieved from ISI/SCI, and were added to the data set using dedicated software. Local and, in particular, temporal stability of the co-citation clusters for this specialty are analyzed in relation to the amount of cognitive resemblance-for the operationalization of this concept, we refer to our foregoing paper of cluster(s) of successive years. Possible causes of discontinuities in either of these two types of information (references and words) will be discussed. "Technology, Work Organization and Stress." Gunilla Bradley-Depart- ment of Sociology, University of Stockholm Theories that apply the concept of understimulation and overstimulation are an important point of departure in the analyses of people's work and working condi- tions in a computerized society. I will illustrate this by referring to a broad theoretical model developed in the RAM project (see below). The model integrates phenomena on both the societal, the organizational, and the individual levels. Three different main types of data processing systems have been studied within the RAM project; they can be related to different phases in the history of computer</page><page sequence="17">Abstracts 99 technology: (1) system of so-called batch type (a government-owned company, the Postal Giro Service); (2) on-line system with display terminals (an insurance com- pany, Trygg-Hansa); and (3) microcomputer system (an electronic company, Philips Electronic Industries). The general theoretical model for analyzing the interplay between computer- ized information systems-psychosocial work environment-family life/leisure time and health focuses on one effect variable: stress (both quantitative and qualitative aspects). The analyses of the psychosocial work environment include the formal work organization, work content, communication structure, leadership, and role ambiguity. Ways to go forward are (1) to specify the demands and requirements on the psychosocial work environment--both stress-related criteria and general re- quirements; (2) to focus some types of stress that can be counteracted with technical aids, aids that affect response times, availability, screen layout, standardization, and so on; and (3) to consider that many stress problems have to do with work organization. When introducing computer technology, not only the lateral division of a work task, but also the vertical division of work, must be considered when designing/changing work tasks and organizing work to suit people's needs and aptitudes. "The 'Greening' of Biotechnology." Eddy C. Brand and Henk W.H.J. Bodewitz-Science Studies Unit, Institute for Energy and Environmen- tal Studies, University of Groningen Biotechnology broadens the domain of biologically based processes and prod- ucts in industrial society. One of the significant advantages claimed for biotechnology is that it is based on biological materials and hence relies on global energy flows as opposed to nonrenewable energy stocks. The reliance is implicit, however, and only poorly articulated in current biotechnological research programs. Analysis of biotechnological development toward "green production" and the use of renewables relates technology studies to such normative issues as the design of alternative "sustainable societies"; in terms of technology studies, it poses the question of the mobilization of research and development in order to create new types of industrial products and processes. But more specifically here, the question is on what terms the above-mentioned shift to biomass as a renewable resource for industry can be counted as a step toward a truly sustainable development in industrial society. The notions of "sustainability" and "renewability," however, are in themselves problematic. There is an overwhelming literature supporting the existence of separate sociocognitive structures in which these concepts are articulated and operational- ized. We will argue that these diverging conceptualizations lay at the heart of the different meanings attributed to the artifacts that arise from biotechnology.</page><page sequence="18">100 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values In this paper, we will illustrate this by presenting some results based on literature and program analysis of a case study on the development of ethanol as an alter- native fuel. "Dealing with Constraints of Biotechnological Research for Small-Scale Farmers in Developing Countries: A Case-Study in Thailand." Jacqueline Broerse and Joske Bunders--Department of Biology and Society, Free University This paper reports on the results of a case study conducted in Thailand during 1987. The overall objective was to acquire insight into the conditions necessary for the effective execution of biotechnological research directed toward a sustained rural development in Thailand. Two important conditions to advance such research are fulfilled in Thailand: (1) The Thai government has already made national com- mitments to advance biotechnology in general; and (2) the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives has the articulated wish to stimulate research toward small-scale farmers. Many constraints, however, can be identified in setting up successful biotech- nological research: extensive bureaucracy, strong hierarchical system, shortage of funds, and lack of qualified scientists and technicians. Although these constraints severely hamper the establishment of a national research capacity, Thailand has proven that they do not have to be insuperable. In the past five years, Thailand has successfully become involved in industrial and human health care biotechnology. By cooperating with people from outside the system (foreigners), Thailand has been able to bypass the majority of constraints in these two fields. The impact of long-term foreign aid reaches beyond the supply of funds and training; it also enables Thailand to handle many of its organizational constraints. Because foreigners do not belong to the Thai community, they can usually get around the strict rules of the bureaucratic apparatus and hierarchical system. Although the development of biotechnological research for small-scale farmers lags behind considerably, the mechanism mentioned above might also work in this field. Therefore, it can be concluded that the major constraint for the execution of biotechnological research for small-scale farmers in Thailand is probably the lack of foreign support. This is due to the fact that this type of research hardly receives any attention in industrialized countries, including the Netherlands. The prospects in this respect, however, are improving. "Enhancing Environmental Resource Management in Developing Nations through Improved Attitudes towards Indigenous Agricultural Knowledge Systems. " David Brokensha-Departments of Anthropology and of En-</page><page sequence="19">Abstracts 101 vironmental Studies, University of California, Santa Barbara-and Eric Vanek--Development Anthropology, Iowa State University In many developing countries, the negative impact of rapidly increasing population and economic development on the environment has led to an increasing interest of planners, policymakers, and agriculturists in the relationship between human society and the natural habitat. Although the biotechnological approach to these merging ecological problems has predominated, during the 1980s, a new perspective of ethno- ecology has drawn attention to the crucial role of human and cultural factors in the interactive development process between communities and their ecosystems. Focusing on the understanding of indigenous agricultural knowledge and decision- making systems, a better assessment has become possible of current agricultural practices and farmer responses to intervention policies and technological innova- tions in the context of the environment. In this approach, local culture is not merely regarded as a barrier, but as a major source of socioeconomic development "from the bottom," thus providing a basic principle for development cooperation activities in the Third World. Cognitive anthropologists and ethnoscientists have developed formal methods of recording these knowledge and decision-making systems. Preliminary efforts by several social scientists to compare and contrast these indigenous systems with scien- tific systems have helped agricultural planners, researchers, and extension person- nel to understand existing systems, to communicate better with the local commun- ity, and to elaborate the concept of participatory and integrative eco-development. "Nature as a Goddess to Be Unveiled by Science: A Deconstruction of 19th Century Plant Geography and Its 20th Century Effects." Christien Brouwer-Social Philosophy Department, University of Amsterdam "Nature as female" is a very old myth that appears in many cultures. Given that the images of women conveyed in this myth may stereotype women, this myth has to be deconstructed. Deconstruction of science concerning this aspect has been done during the last few years in feminist critiques. In these critiques, the accent has been upon the past of science, and its development until the end of the eighteenth century became an object of scrutiny. Several images of women associated with nature have been discovered, for instance, nature as mother, as virgin, and as witch. Attention has also been given to the ethics these images of women brought forth. Nature as witch has, for instance, been related to an exploitative attitude of science to nature. But what happened with the myth of "nature as female" after the end of the eighteenth century? In my paper, a deconstruction of plant geography of the beginning of the nine- teenth century will be discussed. The conclusion will be that nature within this plant</page><page sequence="20">102 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values geography was represented as a goddess, that her godly qualities were related to the qualities of the "ideal woman" image that was developed in the nineteenth- century era of Romanticism, and-last but not least-that this image was related to an empirical, but at the same time respectful, scientific approach of nature. This nineteenth-century approach has been put forward by Margarita Bowen as an alternative for the present-day paradigm in science, which she characterizes as "positivist empiricism." Therefore, I should also like to pose the question whether an alternative approach of nature really necessitates the image of nature as a god- dess. Would we not-from a feminist point of view-prefer a paradigm shift in the direction of yet another image of nature? I opt for the "gender-free" science for which Evelyn Fox Keller called. "Analysis of Genderbias in Ethological Research." A. de Bruijn- Department of Women's Studies in Biology, State University of Utrecht The influence of presuppositions with respect to gender on the contents of science has been studied. These presuppositions will become manifest as genderbias. To analyze this genderbias, 30 papers that report on ethological research on the parent- infant relationship in primates were studied. Genderbias was demonstrated in several places. In only 5 out of 30 papers was a question concerning male parental care for- mulated. Although there seems to be evidence that male parental care is far more extensive than most researchers assume, the majority stick to the opinion that females in particular take care of the infants. This is called bias in questions because re- searchers, apart from internal scientific processes, seem to be influenced by these societal notions. Genderbias was particularly prominent in the results and conclu- sions concerning sex differences. Although the researchers never formulate sex dif- ferences in their hypotheses, and although in several papers sex differences are not studied, they often make observations or statements that do refer to sex differences. This is genderbias because the researcher makes certain gender-colored observa- tions that are no object of study and that are possibly incorrect. Furthermore, gender- bias was present because researchers sometimes draw incorrect inferences about the occurrence of sex differences. These observations and inferences fit exactly ex- isting notions about gender concerning "male" and "female" behavior: the notion that females are passive and coy, and that males are active and aggressive. The occurrence of genderbias is reinforced by the choice of the rhesus monkey as ex- perimental animal (in 14 out of 30 studies). By the mere choice of this monkey, the aforenamed gender-prejudices become easily affirmed. As a first step in develop- ment of a gender-free science, researchers need to reflect more on their own gender- notions. Demonstration of genderbias in existing research is useful to this development.</page><page sequence="21">Abstracts 103 "The Study on Decision-Making of Biological Scientists by Students Being 'Complete Participants.' " Jeanine de Bruin, Annelies Stolp, and Joske Bunders-Department of Biology and Society, Free University In this paper, we discuss the method of "complete participation" and focus on our experiences as graduate students in the role of "complete participants," study- ing decision-making processes in two research groups within the field of biology. We evaluate the surplus values, problems, and constraints of this method. The most important surplus value of using graduate students in a participant role is that students ask specific questions. Because students have to learn about dif- ferent aspects of a research process, they do not surprise group members with specific questions; they are even expected to familiarize themselves with different aspects of the research process. So, the activities that are necessary to get information about knowledge development processes precisely correspond to the activities of graduate students. Another important surplus value of this method is that the participant opera- tionalizes metascientific questions in such a way that they become meaningful within the "language" of the biological research group. A third surplus value is that biology students always participate in different biological research groups during their study. The differences between research groups enable the student to focus on finer structures of decision-making processes within a specific research group. One of the main problems of this method seems to be the dual role of the par- ticipants. In our case, the students became confused about the duality in their loyalty. A main constraint is the lack of distance of participants from their setting. In very familiar settings, it is much more difficult to suspend one's own preconcep- tions. Another constraint is that participants have to learn biological as well as sociological skills and combine them. We concluded that the method of complete participation by graduate students is useful to describe and analyze decision-making processes within scientific groups. With this method, we hope to open a new reservoir of adequate researchers for science and technology studies. "From Problematisation to Enrollment: Finding a Subject for Bio- technology." Robert F. Bud-Science Museum (London) This paper examines the hunt for a subject of biotechnology. It deals with the emergence of the concept of "biotechnology" in the 1930s as a manifestation of applied "biology" and the shift toward an emphasis on applied "microbiology" after the war. Although surveys of the history of biotechnology have emphasized</page><page sequence="22">104 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values the evolution of biotechnology exclusively in terms of man's growing capacity to harness microorganisms, the history can also have been seen as the hunt of biologists for partners in the endeavor to make their discipline the center of the intellectual and commercial stage, and of a variety of professions' attempts to co-opt biology for visionary ends. "Information Technology in the Norwegian Health Services." Trond Buland-Department of Sociology, University of Trondheim After approximately five years of preparations, January 1987 marked the start of the Norwegian National Plan of Action for Information Technology. This co- ordinated plan for a broad-scale Norwegian IT offensive, with a size of approxi- mately 1 billion NOK, is planned to run for three years, with possibilities for a prolongation past these initial years. The present IT plan is divided into the main areas, Education, Technical Equipment, Product Development, Basic Research, and Applications/Technology Diffusion. Behind each of these main headlines, we find several research and development projects, at the present time in an early stage of their lives. As a part of this National Plan of Action, the subprogram "IT in the Health Services" was launched during 1987. The pilot part of this subprogram was ac- complished in 1987, and the actual R&amp;D projects that were accepted for further support are at present in their initial stage. My paper will focus on the forming of the "Health IT" program. I will concen- trate on the process of selection, leading to the final choice of the actual projects, and on the first part of these projects. I will try to illuminate the reasons for choos- ing the actual R&amp;D projects, and the way participation in the "Health IT" pro- gram has and will have influence on, and maybe change, the activities of the research organizations involved. In addition to this, I will look rather briefly on the choice of "IT in the Health Services" as one of the main subprograms in the rather wide and open National Plan. I will study this process of selection and initiation in the light of a "translation perspective," as it is described by, among others, Michel Callon and John Law. In this theoretical perspective, the focus is on how, with the help of what kind of methods, an actor enrolls others in support of a project. This mobilization is necessary in order to start and successfully accomplish a given project. The result of this mobilization is described as an "actor-network," an interrelated set of entities that have been successfully translated or enrolled by an actor. In the actor-network constituted by "IT in the Health Services," you can find projects/actors that are not formally included in the subprogram. Outside the borders of the new, coordinated program, closely related projects are running. These are R&amp;D projects with which the "Health IT" program is forced to relate in one way or another.</page><page sequence="23">Abstracts 105 One of these projects (called PREOP)--outside the coordinated program and the National Plan, but in many ways a part of the "Health IT" program's actor- network-will be studied in a paper from Ann Rudinow Saetnan. These two papers will together shed light on the relations between two related actor-networks, two networks outside each other's formally appointed structures. In many ways, these two networks will relate to each other as if the other were an actor in the actor- network, an actor they are forced to relate to in order to accomplish their own proj- ect's goals successfully. This perspective will be a central point in my study of the Norwegian "Health IT" program. Through studies of the actors networks growing around the selection and initiation of the "IT in the Health Services," I hope to illuminate some of the social processes that take part in the shaping of a country's innovation policy, and in the shaping of the new technology that it is hoped will, and eventually will, be the result of that policy. "Representing Biotechnology: An Ethnography of Quebec Science Policy." Alberto Cambrosio and Camille Limoges-Centre de Recherche en Evaluation Sociale des Technologies (CREST), Universite du Quebec a Montreal Sociology of science has been profoundly renewed in recent years by the use of an ethnographic approach to the study of scientific practice. The same cannot be said of science policy studies. Only a limited number of authors have studied in detail the construction and application of particular science policy programs, and their contributions are mostly based on the a posteriori examination of official documents. In this paper, we will resort to an ethnographic approach in order to study how (and not why) the science and technology staff of the Quebec Govern- ment, starting in 1981, went about devising and applying policy measures as part of what they saw as a general science policy framework for biotechnology. Science policy practices appear to be first and foremost representational practices grounded in particular kinds of literary activities characterized by an extended intertextual web. Constructing a science policy program amounts to constructing an internal (that is, intragovernmental) representation of the relevant external world. This im- plies the utilization of more or less routine practices in order to determine who and what should count as "relevant." A central device, in this respect, is the so-called inventory, in which actors and things are classified according to a set of hetero- geneous, often overlapping categories. To draw up an inventory is not passively to record "reality," but to construct a science policy space and to distribute actors and things so as to allow the government to intervene. Governmental classificatory practices fulfill, in this respect, two related functions: They greatly diminish the complexity and thus the state of uncertainty of the external world and they repre- sent it according to the internal, administrative (and thus operational) divisions. Hav-</page><page sequence="24">106 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values ing shown how classificatory activities construct a science policy space, the paper goes on to account for the ways in which this space is set in motion and its internal dynamics maintained. "Social Construction of Knowledge-Claims and Selection Theory: Specula- tions about a Sociology of Scientific Validity." Donald T. Campbell- Lehigh University Karin Knorr-Cetina (Knorr-Cetina and Mulkay 1983, p. 6) has taken pains to make it clear that "epistemic relativism" does not entail "judgmental relativism," that is, that socially constructed does not entail invalid. Thus she has conceptually opened up the possibility of a theory of the social construction of scientific knowledge claims in which the hypothesized social system of knowledge claim retention and revision allows some role, however small, for "physical reality" (for example) in the social construction of physicists' beliefs. The present paper argues that the strong, symmetrical, relativist, and social constructivist sociologies of science are now ready to be expanded to include a hypothetical comparative sociology of belief-transmitting social systems, in which there is theory as to what kinds of social systems would be most likely to allow a role to "physical reality" in their belief-revision customs. "Invisible physical reality" (were there to be such) presents a particularly interesting problem. In a more recent paper, Knorr-Cetina (1987) has made a substantial con- tribution to this agenda with an extended discussion of the relation between micro- sociological constructivist sociology of science and evolutionary theories of scien- tific conceptual change. In my paper, I attend to details of the many social selection/consensus-formation processes as described by Knorr-Cetina (1981), Latour and Woolgar (1979), and Pickering (1984), making a tentative classification of the reasons why a hypothesis, belief, approach, instrument, and so on were dropped. Reports of something "not working" and of being dropped because of plausible anticipations that it would not work are the sort of reports that make it somewhat plausible that "the way the world is" might play some role in the still profoundly social process of scientific knowledge- claim selection. Instances of failing to consider a thesis because it would show disloyalty to the local group (a "giving-in" to an "enemy" group's beliefs), or because it would offend the head of the lab or the source of the funding, would lack relevance to the issue of improved "validity." "Scientometrics for Less Developed Countries." V. Cano-ICYT, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas This paper examines some of the assumptions behind conventional scientometric indicators for use in less developed countries. It proposes a reorientation of research</page><page sequence="25">Abstracts 107 on conventional indicators, such as productivity measures, impact factor, and cita- tion behavior, to reflect the development of the scientific infrastructure of less developed countries from a local perspective. Two new indicators are proposed: an insularity indicator to measure the degree of participation of scientists in local and international scientific networks, and a biblio-statistical indicator to measure the capacity of the scientific system to pro- duce information about itself. The insularity index is composed of three elements, reflecting (1) the participation of scientists in local research units, (2) the agree- ment of published research topics with stated national research priorities, and (3) the choice of publication outlet. It proposes to measure the participation of a signifi- cant number of local scientists in local invisible colleges as evidence of a critical mass of researchers working on related topics, the agreement of research topics with priority research areas (calculated by means of a co-keyword coefficient) as an indicator of the consensus of the research community with stated national science policy research plans, and the dissemination of the research results in local, rather than international, journals. The biblio-statistical indicator is composed of an availability component deter- mined by the relative number of scientists (as determined from an independently compiled random sample) listed in local directories of scientists, scientific organiza- tions, research institutions, research in progress, and so on, and a timeliness com- ponent equaling the average number of years between the updates of directories. The index measures both the extent and the timeliness with which publications and reference sources about local science are available in an LDC. It reflects the ease with which descriptive pictures about the state of local science can be drawn. The indicators were developed from an understanding that the state of infrastruc- ture of science in most less developed countries needs specific indicators to reflect conditions not necessarily prevalent in technologically developed countries. "A Little Conceptually Innocent Anthropomorphism: Social Cognition for STS." Linnda R. Caporael--Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Alan Turing's "imitation game" is still taken seriously, and in some circles is even defended as a little "conceptually innocent anthropomorphism." (The gist of the imitation game is the inability of an interrogator to distinguish between the answers given by a machine and a human both hidden from view. If the distinction cannot be made, we attribute intelligence to the machine.) But the imitation game falls into both scientific and psychological penumbras. Turing and his successors acknowledged that the test depends on the self as a source of comparative knowledge. Thus rather than being an "objective and fair" test, it is inherently subjective. The most interesting penumbra is psychological. Widely held folk and formal theories assume that distinctions between social and nonsocial objects are obvious. In contrast, social cognition theorists deny such "obviousness" because the con- trast between social and nonsocial categories arises from an interaction between</page><page sequence="26">108 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values the perceiver and the object: the judgment engages the self in a comparative and evaluative cognitive process. If control of an object is important, its features am- biguous (for example, the agency of the object may be in doubt), and no alternative guide to action exists, the self schema may be engaged as a "default" explanation for the behavior of otherwise inexplicable phenomena. Not only computers, but also weather, the planets, natural forces, and animals may be credited with human desires, motivations, and intentions when their behavior is inexplicable but important. Turing failed to appreciate how self-comparison might bias the assessment of intelligence. The "pure reason" that had discovered objective truth in physics and chemistry could not be turned inward to discover equally objective truths about the mind. His own papers illuminate how psychological processes can interact with scien- tific ethos and cultural beliefs in the production of widely accepted but invalid claims to scientific objectivity. "Understanding Invention as a Cognitive Process: The Case of Thomas Edison and the Telephone, 1876-1878." W. Bernard Carlson-University of Virginia-and Michael E. Gorman-Michigan Technological University In the social studies of technology, nothing is more mysterious yet more central than the act of invention. Scholars, however, have yet to develop a precise and coherent interpretation of how an inventor identifies an opportunity, develops a new idea, and manifests it in a physical device. In response to this conceptual lacuna, we have begun a comparative study of several major American inventors. This study combines concepts from both cognitive science and the history of technology and it is based on an analysis of artifacts and manuscript material. In this paper, we wish to report our preliminary findings using the case of Thomas Edison's work on the telephone from 1876 to 1878 as an example. Through this case, we will con- sider how invention may be seen as a cognitive process involving three elements: how an inventor conceptualizes an invention (mental representation); the strategies he or she uses to develop an invention (heuristics); and the specific technical devices used in the construction of the invention (mechanical representations). In using Edison's telephone as a case study, we expect not only to provide new insights into how this important inventor worked but to suggest to other scholars how technological creativity may be conceived and effectively studied. "The Role of Sociology in Designing KBS for Use by the General Public." Marina Case and Sarah Buckland- University of Surrey The life cycle of knowledge based systems (KBS) development consists of several phases. The initial phase (that is, analysis phase), which includes requirements</page><page sequence="27">Abstracts 109 analysis and the knowledge acquisition process, guides and constrains other phases of the KBS life cycle. The approach adopted to elicit and analyze knowledge at this initial stage greatly influences both the information obtained and the priority given to certain aspects of the system. It is in this area that sociologists can make a significant contribution. Sociological techniques are already being used profitably in the analysis phase of system design and, although sociological theories have re- ceived less attention from system builders, these theories can provide a broader perspective on the design process. Most KBS have been located within organizations and industry. Until recently, far less attention has been given to the design of such systems for general public use. In the design of any KBS, users' acceptance of the system is crucial in deter- mining its success. When designing systems for the general public, potential users' needs have an even greater significance in defining the use and relevance of the system. A sociological approach indicates the need for a deeper awareness of the issues involved in designing a system acceptable to users. We would argue that users have a contribution to make not only in determining requirements but also in defining the scope of the knowledge held in the system and the way it is ultimately presented. One of the few systems being developed in the United Kingdom for use by the general public is a welfare benefits advice system. It is being designed by a multidisciplinary team as part of the Alvey DHSS Demonstrator Project. The ex- periences of building this system provide a practical example of the role of sociology in the design of KBS. "An Examination of the Impact of Colonialism in Establishing Negative Values and Attitudes towards Indigenous Agricultural Knowledge Sys- tems." Robert Chambers--Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex-Paul Richards-Department of Anthropology, University Col- lege London-and Janice Jiggins- International Development Consul- tant, Andelst This paper will begin by reviewing the cultural attitudes of the colonizers, which were inspired by European nationalism, concepts of European racial superiority posited by such theories as Social Darwinism, and the dominant scientific paradigms of the colonizing countries. The implications of the colonization and settlement pro- cess, power relations, colonial agricultural policies, and the staffing of agricultural bureaucracies for indigenous agricultural knowledge systems will be reviewed. Using brief case studies of former colonies in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, the paper will draw out the experience of agricultural practitioners in working with and providing services for white settlers and "native" farmers. Some colonial ef- forts, for example, were directed at converting local farming into state-managed operations on which indigenous farmers were instructed to grow cash crops such as cocoa, rubber, and oil palm to market through colonial and expatriate commer-</page><page sequence="28">110 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values cial enterprises. In many former colonies, however, native people were virtually ignored as agricultural development was aimed at helping an expatriate commer- cial farm sector. In Zambia (formerly Northern Rhodesia), for example, the best agricultural land was reserved by statute for expatriate commercial farmers- including all land along the railway line. The expatriate farmers were also paid higher prices than the African farmers for crops such as maize. Finally, the paper will draw out the implications for postindependence agricultural development orienta- tion to indigenous agricultural knowledge systems. "The Affect of Scientific Communication on High-Technology Policies in Germany and Taiwan." Peggy S. Christoff- Thomas More College- and Frank L. Rusciano-Rider College The development of high technology depends on how scientists interact to ex- pand scientific knowledge. Diana Crane's concept of the invisible college is par- ticularly relevant especially as scholars in many academic disciplines observe that an international body of knowledge must be better utilized in order to upgrade liv- ing standards on a global level. In this study, we choose a comparative approach in order to discover whether and in what ways models of technological develop- ment vary between nations. We selected the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of China as case studies, primarily because both countries have devoted extensive governmental resources to the development of high technology, and we interviewed scientists about their communication behavior. Our sample consists of two groups of scientific elites within both Germany and Taiwan. The first group is those who have been formally recognized as their nation's top scientists. The second group is the scientists who are involved in implementing their government's new policy of high-technology development. Among the preliminary findings for a cross-national comparison of scientific communication are the following: (1) Chinese scientists tend to interact with their colleagues in other research in- stitutes and departments more than German scientists. (2) German scientists tend to form both international and domestic cooperative science groups more than Chinese scientists. (3) Chinese scientists tend to extend their spheres of influence by writing ar- ticles in nonacademic journals and stating their opinions on subjects related to their research in the mass media, whereas German scientists tend to distance themselves. (4) German scientists tend to extend their spheres of influence by discussing their research with colleagues in different academic fields, even with scientists from other countries, whereas Chinese scientists tend to distance themselves. Also, this paper discusses how these social interactions represent Germany's and Taiwan's respective national and ethnic cultures and whether they benefit or limit advancements in high-technology areas.</page><page sequence="29">Abstracts 111 "The American Life Sciences as Start-Up and Consolidating Industries, circa 1890-1970." Adele E. Clarke-Tremont Research Institute, Stan- ford University, University of California, San Francisco In considering the impacts of the rise of industrialization on the life sciences in the United States, we can usefully conceptualize the wide array of organizing and institutionalizing activities at the turn of the century (circa 1890-1940) as similar to those of a start-up industry or industrial sector. The "start-up" era was followed by one of consolidation (circa 1920-1970), akin to "shake-out" processes in the contemporary computing industry. This framework coherently integrates a wide array of important issues in the historical development of the modem life sciences. The form of organization of the life sciences in both eras is viewed as an arena or sector composed of all the social worlds or collective actors that were linked to the life sciences in some way. These include all its audiences: other sciences, sponsors (for example, universities and funding sources), amateur organizations, and related industries as markets and consumers. Scientific disciplines have tradi- tionally been viewed as knowledge production worlds while manufacturing worlds produce particular products. This paper conceptually mutes this distinction, focus- ing instead on the organization of the work itself and relations with audiences as composing an industrial arena or sector. There are four interlinked phenomena: (1) the growth of universities as training and research institutions; (2) the shifting and growing sponsorship of research; (3) the growth of related manufacturing industries (for example, pharmaceuticals, biological supplies, agriculture) dependent upon scientific research for new and im- proved product development; and (4) the emergence of the life sciences as a com- plex research enterprise. These are examined vis-a-vis the contrasting properties of start-up and consolidating phases, including patterns of growing commitment to the endeavor by a widening array of participants; increasing demands for university-trained workers as well as for knowledge; an elaborating division of labor and career structure; a shift from highly porous to tighter disciplinary and profes- sional boundaries; the shift from high rates of new lines of work emerging through segmentation to patterns of merger of lines of work as linkages became more coherent; a shift from a wide array of institutional experiments to more conven- tionalized forms; increasingly well-organized audiences and resources; a develop- ing infrastructure to provide "basic necessities" for scientific work (for example, instruments and materials); and increasingly rationalized fiscal sponsorship. "Intervention Programs in Science and Mathematics for Minority Students: The Growing Focus on the Middle School Years." Beatriz Chu Clewell-Educational Testing Service</page><page sequence="30">112 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values This paper will present a brief overview of the history and characteristics of intervention programs in science and mathematics in general, giving a rationale for the growing focus on establishing these programs during the middle school years, or at least by junior high school. It will also report the results of a study that iden- tified and described 163 intervention programs in the United States targeting females and minority middle school students. The study characterized programs in terms of the target population, population served, subject area focus, grade levels served, regional distribution, activities and services offered, and service delivery models. In other words, the study presents a complete picture of the status of intervention in science and mathematics for mid- dle school minority and female students in the United States. The paper will also summarize the findings of the study, identify gaps in service delivery, and, based on these research findings, make policy recommendations. The paper will conclude with a case study of a science intervention program for minority middle school students. The case study will describe the program history, setting, administrative structure, participants, program components, approaches and strategies, and evaluation results. 'The Development of a Sociological Theory of Science: A 50-Year Perspec- tive." Randall Collins- Department of Sociology, University of Califor- nia, Riverside The sociology of science began in the 1930s to become differentiated from the sociology of knowledge, which had no specific focus on science as an institution and typically exempted scientific knowledge from social explanation. This began to change as the result of Marxian criticisms of the role of science in capitalism. Merton then led a counterattack, drawing upon both Weberian ideas and the cur- rent development of a historiography of science. The ensuing functionalist sociology of science up through the 1950s was largely embedded in the theory of professions and in descriptions of alleged core values. The takeoff of the autonomous sociology of science took place in the early 1960s, around four main lines of work: Derek Price's measurements of scientific produc- tivity and his theory of "research fronts" and "invisible colleges"; Thomas Kuhn's historically based theory of normal science, paradigms, and revolutions; Joseph Ben- David's studies of scientific innovations based on career dynamics within educa- tional and other formal organizations; and Warren Hagstrom's empirical studies of scientists' behavior in regard to originality, competition, and mutual validation. Each of these led to a series of empirical and theoretical developments. The phase of takeoff into self-propelled growth in the sociology of science thus shows multi- ple theory groups carrying rival paradigms, although there were also various alliances and crossovers among these groups. In the late 1970s, the sociology of science entered a new phase. Research in- spired by ethnomethodology has been carried out on the actual practice of scientists</page><page sequence="31">Abstracts 113 in constructing their knowledge and discourse. The mood of the larger intellectual community in the late twentieth century includes a turn toward relativism, re- flexiveness, and a revival of Idealist themes. At the same time, there continues to be an accumulation of research that is congruent with a theoretical understanding of the organizational conditions underlying the production of various kinds of in- tellectual products. "Interlinkages among Intellectual Communities: Mathematicians and Phil- osophers in China versus Europe." Randall Collins-Department of Sociology, University of California, Riverside This research traces master-pupil linkages and horizontal networks among notable mathematicians and philosophers in China from the Warring States period through the Ming Dynasty, in ancient Greece and the Hellenistic world, and in early modern and modern Europe. The communities of philosophers in China and in Greece/Europe have similar long-term network structures, both in linkages across generations and contemporaneous cliques and rivalries. Networks of mathematicians in Greece/ Europe are similar to the structural relationships among philosophers, whereas in China the mathematical networks are looser and have much less continuity. A ma- jor difference in the intellectual life of China versus Europe, reaching back to an- cient times, is in the relationship between the intellectual communities of philosophers and mathematicians: In Greece/Europe, networks of mathematicians and philosophers reach their maximal generational and horizontal connectedness in the same historical periods; whereas in China, the peak periods for mathematical and philosophical activity are largely unconnected. In Greece/Europe, the two communities of mathematicians and philosophers are connected in major periods by individuals par- ticipating in both of them; whereas in China, there are virtually no mathematician- philosophers. The exception is in the Mohist school during the late Warring States period, a time when the structural organization of Chinese intellectual life is most parallel to that in Europe. Thus the reorganization of intellectual life in the Ch'in and Han dynasties marks the crucial intellectual divergence of China and Europe. I conclude by discussing the importance of network structures of intellectual com- munities for the content of intellectual activities; for instance, the importance of proofs in Western mathematics, and of the mathematical ideal of knowledge in Western philosophy. We also learn something of the nature of the intellectual "ter- ritories" that are appropriated by the intellectual communities of philosophy and mathematics. "The Impact of Changing Values towards Indigenous Agricultural Knowledge Systems on Improved Communications between Agricultural</page><page sequence="32">114 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values Research and Extension Scientists and Small-Scale Farmers." Lin Compton- Department of Continuing and Vocational Education, Univer- sity of Wisconsin-and John Schafer-Department of Agronomy, Iowa State University Robert Chambers has described the difficulty involved in improving communica- tions between agricultural scientist and small-scale farmers as follows: Modern scientific knowledge is centralized and associated with the machinery of the state; and those who are its bearers believe in its superiority. Indigenous technical knowledge, in contrast, is scattered and associated with low prestige rural life; even those who are its bearers may believe it to be inferior. It is difficult for some scientists to accept that they have anything to learn from rural people, or to recognize that there is a parallel system of knowledge to their own, which is complementary, usually valid, and in some respects superior [1980, p. 2]. This paper discusses the impact of recorded systems of indigenous agricultural knowledge on the understanding of small-scale farmers by agricultural scientists. A set of methodologies, known as ethnoscience, provided systematic means for scien- tists to record indigenous agricultural knowledge and decision-making systems. When some of these classification systems were compared to the scientific systems, it became obvious that many indigenous systems were complex, rational, and func- tional-and frequently very different from the Western systems. The indigenous knowledge generated at the local level began to be viewed by agricultural scientists as an important, but neglected, national resource that could be tapped in order to improve communications between agricultural scientists and small-scale farmers. "Instrumentation Intensity of the Sciences: Is It Growing and Why?" Susan E. Cozzens-Department of Science and Technology Studies, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Instrumentation seldom has been taken explicitly into account as a factor in the change of scientific ideas, yet a number of examples point to its importance. The plate tectonics revolution, for instance, consists of experimental confirmation of an old theory, confirmation made possible by (military-funded) improvements in instrumentation. Such examples suggest that, if we are to avoid constructing unrealistic models of the dynamics of science, it is important to understand where instrumentation change comes from and how innovations diffuse. This paper reports on an exploratory study of the instrument intensity of eight subfields of science during the postwar period. The subfields are spread across the physical, life, biological, and engineering sciences. Half of them were growing very quickly during this period and half were growing rather slowly. In the study, men- tions of instruments in journal articles (samples drawn at five-year intervals) form a basis for describing the gradual increase in instrument intensity and the kinds of</page><page sequence="33">Abstracts 115 instruments that contribute to it. The articles themselves are examined for preliminary indications of the types of relationships that may obtain between processes of knowledge growth in the subfields and the introduction and diffusion of instruments. The method and results suggest ways of moving forward with more general research on the role of instruments in cognitive change. "The Changing Relationship between Environmental Activists and Scien- tists in the Dutch Post-War Period." Jacqueline Cramer-Department of Science Dynamics, University of Amsterdam This paper will focus on how social movements can influence the development of science. Generally speaking, the impact of social movements on the production of scientific knowledge is rather diffuse. Knowledge claims brought forward by social movements reach the scientific community in a variety of sometimes very subtle ways. Moreover, the receptivity of scientists to incorporating new ideas from "outside" may fluctuate over time depending on a variety of factors. In order to grasp this diffuse process of mutual influence, I shall focus on one particular social movement, namely, the Dutch environmental movement. The impact of the Dutch environmental movement on the development of science will be assessed along two dimensions: (1) the degree of integration of the Dutch environmentalists into the science system, and (2) the degree of cognitive compatibil- ity of the "knowledge interests" put forward by the Dutch environmentalists with those of the scientists. By "knowledge interests," I mean the core set of ideas and strategies concerning the production and use of knowledge. In order to unravel the various features of the knowledge interests of the environmentalists, I shall distinguish three dimensions: cosmology, technology, and knowledge production. The central questions of this paper are these: (1) How have knowledge interests of the Dutch environmentalists gradually evolved over the last two decades? (2) How have shifts in these knowledge interests affected the relationship between scien- tists and environmental activists? I will show that originally the Dutch environmen- talists were able to influence the development of science by stimulating the establish- ment of new environmental research programs, but that in the course of time, this impact decreased due to a divergence of knowledge interests between scientists and environmental activists. The impact of the Dutch environmentalists on knowledge production now lies in the development of concrete research projects. "Evaluating Research Productivity of Universities in the Federal Republic of Germany." Hans-Dieter Daniel-University of Constance The research performance of universities in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) is often regarded as unsatisfactory. Thus, for example, the German Science</page><page sequence="34">116 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values Council (Wissenschaffsrat), in its "Recommendations on University Research and the Allocation of Resources," explicitly was in doubt "as to whether the produc- tivity and quality of research in the FRG had grown in a manner commensurate with the amount of equipment and the number of researchers employed on the univer- sity level." To obtain better knowledge of how high-quality research could be promoted at German universities, a representative survey, "On the State of University Research" was conducted in 1976-1977. In this study, publication counts were used to deter- mine which universities are the best in the FRG. The results of our analysis of these data show that it is quite problematic to ag- gregate individual performance data according to universities, given that there is much more variation within universities than between them. The extremely high interindividual variability of research performance considerably restricts the use- fulness of university ranking lists. This can be demonstrated using the following example. In a study conducted by Spiegel-Rosing (1975), the University of Hohenheim was placed last among German universities. By contrast, "On the State of University Research" ranked Hohenheim at the top of the scale. According to our analysis, the top-ranking of Hohenheim was based solely on the extraordinarily high research productivity of one professor. In a second study on research productivity in the field of psychology, the basic findings of our first study were confirmed. The distribution of research productiv- ity (number of contributions listed in the Source Index of the SSCI 1978-1982, and number of books listed in German Books in Print 1985-1986) were extremely skewed and could be described by Lotka's Law. The results of this study also confirmed Price's Law-5% of all scientists accounted for 50% of the total output. Thus if, in research, "individuals are what it all comes down to" (Maier- Leibnitz), then comparative analyses of research performance should always focus their attention on individual researchers or small research groups. "The Social Organisation of Technical Invention: Some Conceptual Reflec- tions." Meinolf Dierkes-Wissenschafszentrum Berlin Given the still insufficient understanding of the specific social character of technical invention, the recent calls that social studies of technology should profit from the work done in social studies of science are well taken. Technology as well as scientific findings are essentially "new knowledge," and if it has been possible to understand parts of the processes of the construction of scientific knowledge, this should be of some use for the analysis of technical knowledge as well. But more attention has to be paid to the differences between the two kinds of knowledge. Some important aspects would be the textual or material character of the "inven- tion" or "finding"; the way innovations are communicated among actors in the field; the organization of potential "innovators" (scientific or technical) in institu-</page><page sequence="35">Abstracts 117 tions, "communities," "disciplines," or professions; and the relation of these organizations to the potential audience of "users" and to society at large. All these aspects are obviously related. They suggest that a fruitful transfer of concepts from science studies to studies of technology keep specific attention to two (again related) questions. First, a focus should be on the social organization of technical invention, comparing the societal loci of the emergence of technologies to the organization of the scientific field, including, of course, those areas where the two overlap. Assuming that organization matters, one fruitful concept to recon- sider would be the notion of culture understood as shared orientations and values that emerge over time in social contexts of high interaction. Such shared orienta- tions may exist in companies that develop technologies, scientific institutions, or engineering professions and engineering schools and may shape their outlook on technologies. Second, not to reify such a notion of culture, it is important that a long-term perspective be adopted showing how such orientations emerge, consolidate, or decay in relation to changing macro-societal contexts of the organization. "Mediating Structure and Practice in Science Studies: An Agenda for the 1990s." Gary L. Downey- Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Much contemporary debate within science and technology studies builds upon a contrast between two radically opposed images of social action. "Structure- oriented" accounts treat actors as implementing or enacting preexisting structures through their action. From this point of view, which dominated studies in the 1960s and 1970s, actors are interesting only as vehicles for reproducing structures. The primary conceptual interest concerns the nature of structures. "Practice-oriented" accounts move actors to center stage as the source of heterogeneous, constitutive choices and judgments. From this point of view, which achieved mainstream con- sideration during the 1980s, the primary conceptual problem is to show how context- specific choices and judgments generate new structures. The opposition between these images differs from the macro/micro and actor/ structure distinctions, which tend to be understood from a structure-oriented perspec- tive. Practice-oriented analysis has provided an important corrective to the deter- minism of much structure-oriented analysis. Yet it has too often been a dialectical overreaction. For where structure-oriented analysis was good at accounting for con- tinuity but poor at accounting for change, practice-oriented analysis is good at ac- counting for change but poor at accounting for continuity. A challenge for the 1990s, both within STS and across the social sciences and humanities, is to mediate the two perspectives. How might action be simultaneously a phenomenon of structure and practice? Can we account with equal facility for how both continuities and changes in structures occur by means of actors' prac- tices? I outline specific problems needing resolution by comparing two attempts</page><page sequence="36">118 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values to resolve them. One is found in Michel Callon's concept of "actor worlds." A second appears in the concept of "cultural identity," which I have advanced. "The Star Wars Controversy: Military Mission Funding and Its Long Term Effects on Basic Research." Aant Elzinga- Department of 7heory of Science, University of Gothenburg This paper sets out to review briefly various dimensions in the controversy sur- rounding the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) or "Star Wars" program in the United Slates. An attempt is made to tease out military-strategic, industrial policy, and general moral and political components of the controversy from technical scientific components. On this basis, some analytical comments are made on the interrela- tionship between social, political, and cognitive dimensions of scientific research. Thereafter, some of the observations and arguments will be taken up concerning the long-term (actual and/or potential) effects of the SDI program on the conditions of basic research, and finally some conclusions will be drawn more generally con- cerning certain forms of mission orientation and national science policies. The paper will further develop the concept of epistemic drift in relation to the military sector and the possible militarization of the gray zone between basic and applied research. In the main, the paper will underline the concern of many physicists, computer scien- tists, and others in militarily relevant fields of basic research that the SDI program is detrimental to the well-being of the very core of science needed for the United States to meet the global challenge of high-technology markets in the 1990s. "Academic Organizational Innovations and Structural Change and the Evolution of Academic Norms." Henry Etzkowitz-State University of New York, Purchase-and Lois S. Peters- Rensselaer Polytechnic Insti- tute This paper will present results of a study sponsored by the National Science Foundation on the relationship of academic organizational innovations to accom- modate industry funding and their relationship to the evolution of academic norms. The study design includes comparison of three technological institutes and four broad- spectrum universities, two of which draw a historical emphasis on liberal arts and two of which have a historical emphasis on science- and engineering-related materials, science and computer science, and electrical engineering, and two of which are tradi- tional sciences-biology and chemistry. Three specific issues are reviewed in depth: disposition of intellectual property rights, multiple faculty roles causing diversions of commitment and time, and the role and function of the research university in economic development.</page><page sequence="37">Abstracts 119 Results show that changing academic attitudes are dependent on disciplinary dif- ferences and on the character of organizational innovations. Administrative strategies toward organizational innovations and industry funding are contrasted with those of the faculty. "The Saving of the Bathingwater Child." Saskia I. Everts-Research Centre on Women and Technology, University of Twente, Enschede Given the desire to overcome the gap between the world of engineers and the world of women, some feminists argue that, in some respects, it is the world of engineers that is the side of the equation that should be questioned and adjusted. Some of the characteristics that are traditionally taught to women could be quite valuable to technology. Training women to loose such attitudes, in the process of making them more equal to men, would be like throwing out the child with the bathingwater, as the Dutch expression goes. One of the qualities often referred to in this context is a caring attitude toward people and society, a feeling of responsibility, and a wish to do something good for the world, traits which are seen as especially cultivated in women. This paper will report on an empirical study among a group of university- employed technological researchers, which was designed to check and specify the assumption that this "caring" would be lacking in the culture of technological re- searchers. First results show that most researchers did have an ambition to do "useful" research. "Useful" to them, however, did not mean "good for society" in a general sense. Rather, they tended to operationalize it as "having enough results" and "having an institution willing to finance the research." There was little doubt and barely any dissent regarding this issue. A number of mechanisms will be described that seem to contribute to this specific interpretation of usefulness. This will lead to some suggestions as to what these mechanisms show us about possibilities, impossibilities, and necessary conditions for a different "feminine" attitude to survive and grow-or, in short, about the possibilities of "saving the bathingwater child." "The Quantitative Study of Scientific (E)migration Processes." Klaus Fischer- Technische Universitat Berlin Conventional studies of migration and emigration processes have concentrated almost exclusively on the migrating individuals and their effects on host institu- tions and on individual scientists working therein. On the other hand, models have been proposed that were intended to describe the processes of information diffu- sion co-occurring with migration phenomena. However, both research strategies</page><page sequence="38">120 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values have difficulties in analyzing forms of scientific change not attributable to individual actors or evolving communication facilities but to social and cognitive processes within scientific specialties. To show how (e)migration effects located on the specialty level can be depicted by empirical means, a longitudinal citation and co-citation study of the nuclear physics community between 1920 and 1947 was designed. Some results of this study will be reported that are relevant for answering questions like the following: -What is the relative standing of publications written by (e)migrants in the specialty as compared with residents' publications? -Are there biases in favor or against (e)migrants' publications, as measured by citation counts? Are these citations normally distributed over domains such as space (country), time (period), journal, or (e)migrant strata? -Can regularities of this type (if there are any) be interpreted as indicators of prejudice or processes of acculturation? -Are there specific journals that could be termed "emigre journals" or "nonemigre journals" because of the gross over- or underrepresentation of emigrant's works found therein? What types of journals are these? -How influential were migrant or emigrant physicists in the specialty-as visualized in their position within "citation-landscapes," citation matrices, or sim- ple citation counts over or within periods? Are these measures compatible with historians' or participants' qualitative judgments? "Demarcation of the Social Sciences: The Case of the Canadian Social Science Research Council." Donald Fisher- University of British Columbia The boundary of interest in this paper was established in 1941 with the creation of the Canadian Social Science Research Council (CSSRC). This self-defined boun- dary separated the new corps of "social scientists" from the humanist tradition in which they had been housed. Through a process of demarcation, the "social sciences" were separated from the humanities, the natural sciences, and professional fields of study. The process of demarcation will be described in this paper as boundary work. The perspective directs attention toward the ways in which power is inscribed into and attached to some ideas rather than others. There are three objects of concern. First, to provide a sociohistorical account of the creation of the CSSRC. The process of demarcation will be described and explained. The focus is on the roles occupied by Canadian and United States social scientists, and the involvement of the following institutions: Canadian professional associations in the social sciences and humanities; the United States Social Science Research Council; the Carnegie Corporation; and the Rockefeller Foundation. Second, by utilizing a conceptual model labeled "boundary work," this author will provide a sociological interpretation of these events. At the heart of this analysis</page><page sequence="39">Abstracts 121 is the distinction between science and nonscience. "Science" for these social scientists was housed in the language of "purity," which meant that the new council had to be academic, independent, and oriented toward fundamental research. Those disciplines and fields that were perceived to be too practical, too applied, or too popular were excluded. Third, and closely tied to the second objective, is the at- tempt to provide insight into the relation between social scientists and the society in which they live. The changes described in this paper were pushed by the needs of war and the perception of U.S. foundations and the Canadian State that social scientific knowledge could serve a useful purpose. "Artificial Intelligence Invents Itself: Collective Identity and Boundary Maintenance in a New Scientific Discipline." Diana Forsythe-Depart- ment of Computer Science, Stanford University Artificial intelligence (AI) is a relatively new discipline, first formally named in the mid-1950s. Perhaps because it is so new, the meaning and appropriate scope of "artificial intelligence" are subject to ongoing negotiation, both in the literature and in day-to-day discussion in the laboratory. This paper presents findings from an extended ethnographic study of an AI laboratory in California's Silicon Valley. The scientists studied are "knowledge engineers," computer specialists who build complex programs (known as "knowledge-based" or "expert" systems) that are intended to emulate human expertise. Within the lab, the phrase "that's not AI" is heard with some frequency. The paper considers the processes of boundary definition and maintenance that take place through the use of such expressions. Two aspects of this problem are discussed: -Negotiations about the boundary of the field itself: These concern the mean- ing of "doing AI" as opposed to pursuing various other disciplines. On this level, it is noteworthy that, although there appears to be considerable overlap between the concerns and methods of artificial intelligence and those of other disciplines such as anthropology, sociology, and psychology, knowledge engineers acknowledge little common ground between AI and these neighboring social science disciplines. This attitude reflects the knowledge engineers' efforts to establish AI as both a separate discipline and one that belongs to the "hard" sciences. -Negotiations about the space defined by this boundary: These occur when, for example, knowledge engineers debate the merits of different systems and ap- proaches, such as the relative advantages of rule-based versus probability-based techniques for encoding uncertainty in expert systems. Approaches are evaluated partly in terms of the extent to which they correspond to different knowledge engineers' ideal models of what AI should be. In this context, "that's not AI" can constitute a contribution to ongoing negotiations concerning their shared assump- tions about the essential nature of AI and their dreams about the future of the field.</page><page sequence="40">122 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values "Will the Real Ethnographer Please Stand Up? Scrutinizing the An- thropology of Science." Barbara Frankel--Lehigh University The new sociologists of science have produced a spate of famous studies labeled "ethnographies of science," that is, micro-sociological descriptions of scientific laboratories and institutions carried out by participant-observation (Latour and Woolgar 1979; Knorr-Cetina 1981). In so doing, they have rightly emphasized the importance of persuasion and discourse within scientific communities: the ways in which scientific meanings are negotiated, the relation of persuasion to theory change, and the rhetorical devices that constitute genre requirements for scientific publications. We are greatly indebted to these social constructionist "ethnographers" of science for demonstrating that discourse constitutes the effective world of scientists, just as it does that of any other group of "natives"-and that understanding scientists' in-group dialogues is important if we are to make sense of their behavior. But do the new "ethnographers of science" scrutinize their own dialogue with the natives with equal care? Do they leave themselves in the data? This paper tries to answer that question and to draw out some of the epistemological implications of the answer for the new social sciences of science. Such scrutiny is motivated by recent developments in ethnography, whereby many anthropologists have strongly criticized the pseudo-objectivity that treats the parti- cipant-observer as an invisible, all-seeing eye, and have called for an epistemologic- ally appropriate standard of ethnographic reporting. The most conspicuous demand is for a "dialogical anthropology," that is, one that analyzes both sides of the con- versations in which we engage with the people we study. Important to this kind of ethnography is analysis of the rhetoric of ethnographic reports and a thoroughgoing perspectival relativism. But even more central to any self-consistent social con- structivism-of science or anything else-is to leave the ethnographer in the data. "Question-Asking Methods for Investigating the Cognitive Structure of Scientific Knowledge." Eric G. Freedman- -Michigan Technological University Scientific knowledge often grows by adding and deleting concepts. The present paper argues that scientific knowledge is represented in scientists' cognitive struc- tures and that these structures change as scientific concepts are added and deleted. A number of methods, such as question-asking, have been developed to represent knowledge structures. Generating knowledge structures, using question-asking, in- volves directly asking subjects about particular concepts, classifying subjects' responses into statements that express the same idea, and, finally, connecting the</page><page sequence="41">Abstracts 123 statements together that express relations among them, for example, statement2 is a property statement. Thus knowledge is represented by a set of statements or nodes connected to each other by a set of relations or links. A psychological theory of conceptual change in science should be avowedly cognitive; that is, it should provide a description in terms of cognitive processes used by scientists and avoid reliance on other disciplines (for example, philosophy) in determining its research agenda. A central task for any cognitive theory of con- ceptual change in science is to articulate: (1) the types of changes in scientific con- cepts, and (2) the mechanisms of conceptual change. These changes in conceptual structures include node addition, node deletion, and node reorganization. With regard to the mechanisms of conceptual change, it can be suggested that a number of reason- ing strategies, such as analogical reasoning, hypothesis-testing, and abductive reason- ing, are used by scientists to determine what nodes will be added or deleted. To show how these procedures can be used to represent scientists' knowledge struc- tures, examples both from a sample of undergraduates who have been questioned about several psychological concepts and from a sample of advanced psychology graduate students who have been questioned about their areas of research will be provided. Understanding how scientists represent concepts may provide an additional method for explaining scientific discourse. Members of a scientific community are assumed to share similar cognitive representations. Scientists pursue empirical and theoretical problems to elaborate the cognitive structures of their discipline. Which concepts will be selected and retained is determined by how well they sit within the scientists' cognitive structures. Finally, use of these types of representational systems for historical cases of innovation and invention in science will be discussed. "Toward a Political-Economy of Disciplines: The Nobel Science Prizes, 1915-1939, and the 'Knowledge/Power' Complex." Robert Marc Fried- man-Institute for Studies in Research and Higher Education, the Norwegian Research Council for Science and the Humanities "Discipline" entails in its various meanings control, obedience, orderliness, acceptance of or submission to authority, and membership in a well-regulated, restricted order. And scientific disciplines are basically mechanisms that organize and regulate the efficient production and circulation of knowledge. As such, any deeper understanding of disciplines should include the processes of control and steer- ing. Investigations should strive to reveal such processes and show how profes- sional market forces and investment strategies come into play within and among disciplines; how disciplinary resources and audiences are created and negotiated. Although these themes are not new, further detailed empirical-theoretical studies are needed to help us understand why and how the "knowledge/power" configura- tion assumes specific forms at differing periods for particular disciplines.</page><page sequence="42">124 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values Some insight into the mechanisms of disciplinary change can be won from the study of the Nobel science prizes. Deliberations related to awarding Nobel prizes became enmeshed in the processes by which the Swedish researchers attempted to define and legitimize their particular notions of physics and chemistry: The Nobel prize might well be understood as a resource within a political economy of disciplines. By the 1920s, a number of issues promoted a heightened understanding among committee members that the prize institution was one of several resources that could be used in shaping disciplinary change. Limited material and personnel resources heightened the ecological relationship among research specialties and institutions at a time that several disciplinary-entrepreneurs hoped to create internationally oriented schools-the growth or introduction of new specialties often had to be ac- complished at a cost to others. Methodological, epistemological, and cognitive- boundary criteria in part informed disciplinary politics. Such strategies included the Nobel prize institution (both awarding and withholding prizes) as a source of authority, legitimation, and funding. "The Units of Analysis in Science Studies." Ronald N. Giere-Department of Philosophy and Center for Philosophy of Science, University of Minnesota This paper compares different approaches to an overall theory of science by ex- amining the units of analysis employed in these approaches-that is, the basic en- tities, properties, and relations in terms of which the activity of science is to be explained. Within a logical empiricist framework, for example, the basic units of analysis are individual statements. For postpositivist philosophers of science, such as Imre Lakatos and Larry Laudan, the unit of analysis is a series of related theories called a research tradition. Both of these philosophical approaches abstract from the individuals and groups who do science. Merton' s theory of science consisted of a structural-functional analysis in which the units of analysis are norms of behavior. Among the most prominent of more recent sociologies of science are the interest model promoted by the Edinburgh school and the more radical social constructivist approach associated with the works of Latour and Woolgar and Knorr-Cetina. If one takes the units of analysis in these approaches to be kinds of interests or kinds of social interactions, one ends up with a structural account without the usual functionalism. My dissatisfaction with both philosophical and sociological structuralisms is that they fail to capture the basic causal interactions that drive science as a human ac- tivity. These interactions occur primarily among individual people, and it is only individual people that possess the motive power to generate social activities. The alternative to structuralism is to take the individual scientist as the basic unit of analysis. It follows, as Marc DeMey has argued, that we must look to the cognitive sciences for our most basic models, for it is these sciences that currently provide the best causal models of the cognitive activities of individual human agents.</page><page sequence="43">Abstracts 125 "Teratogenicity: The Impact of Scientific Development on Regulation." Nanda Gilden and Henk Bodewitz- Science Studies Unit, Institute for Energy and Environmental Studies, University of Groningen The impact of the thalidomide disaster on teratology as a scientific field has been radical. Before these dramatic events, the field was mainly characterized by pathological-anatomic studies on malformed offspring. The extensive legislation shortly after the thalidomide affair in many countries changed this situation com- pletely, as teratogenic effects became a main target in the risk assessment especial- ly of drugs, and later on also of pesticides, food additives, and other chemicals. A new field of screening activities emerged, in which teratology became a toxicity- oriented scientific field. That period is characterized by the development of new test systems and the drafting of guidelines in which the test programs became fixed. As the amount of testing increased, a debate on the rationale behind all this safety work started. This resulted in a demand for research on the mechanisms behind the teratogenic effects, as well as for a better knowledge of normal fetal develop- ment. This demand was partly met by molecular and developmental biologists from academia moving into the field. The complex and changing conditions with respect to knowledge changed teratogenicity from being a major risk at the time of the thalidomide disaster to being a risk under suspicion, in a twofold meaning. On the one hand, it is argued that it is actually a rare phenomenon in humans. Most data are actually from disasters such as the methylmercury poisoning at Minamata in Japan or from single cases reported as such in the literature. Seen from that point of view, it is emphasized that it is better to see teratogenicity as only one of the possible reproductive tox- icological effects, and certainly not the most important one by definition. On the other hand, it is argued that the proliferation of the meaning of teratogenicity im- plies that teratogenicity is most likely an important risk issue, although mostly unknown and not recognized as such. This last aspect especially points to func- tional (for example, behavioral) deficits. In this paper, we will focus on the discussion of whether to maintain teratogenicity as an issue in safety and health policy instead of reproductive toxicity as the main issue and its effect on research. "On the Theory and Application of Scientometric Indicators." W. Glaenzel, A. Schubert, and T. Braun- Information Science and Scientometrics Research Unit, Library of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Scientometric indicators (Braun et al. 1985)-first of all, citation-based indi- cators-are useful tools in the complex procedure of assessing and comparing research performance. Typical objects of such assessments or comparisons are, for exam-</page><page sequence="44">126 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values pie, individual scientists, research groups, institutes, or even all scientists of a country in a given subject field. Given that scientometric indicators are strongly influenced by the publication and citation habits in different science fields, these comparative assessments must be restricted to sufficiently narrow specialties. In our recent studies, relative indicators were used for assessing and comparing the citation impact of several countries in various science fields (Braun et al. 1985; Schubert and Braun 1983). "Observed" and "expected" impact indicators were compared, and statistical reliability measures were derived in order to decide whether their differences were significant at any given confidence level. In the present paper, this method is generalized by taking the "field average" value of the scientometric indicator into consideration. A stochastic model is developed that permits a pseudo-three- dimensional arrangement of the indicator values into 27 classes according to the significance of deviations between observation, average, and expectation, respec- tively. For optimum results, the samples must be assumed to have a size of at least 50-100 items and at most 10% of the total population. Therefore, this appears to be the preferred method for cross-country comparisons in given science fields. As an example, a cross-country comparison in Analytical Chemistry is presented. Mean Citation Rate and Mean Response Time are chosen as scientometric indicators. Ex- perience shows that, as a consequence of the Matthew-Effect, the above 27 classes can be grouped into three to four main categories. If the size of the samples in question does not exceed 50-100 items (for example, publications of a single scientist or of an institute), the method of "characteristic scores and scales" should be used in- stead (Braun et al. 1987; Glaenzel and Schubert 1988). With the help of this op- tionally refinable method, top individual performances can be set off from above- average performances. Characteristic scales have interesting properties that are also illustrated by examples. References Braun, T., W. Glaenzel, and A. Schubert. 1985.

"A Case Study on the Impact of a New Instrument on a Developing Scien- tific Domain: The Introduction of Laser Doppler Anemometry in Tur- bulent Reacting Flows Studies." Iskender Gokalp-CNRS-CRCCHT, Orleans</page><page sequence="45">Abstracts 127 The relations between the theoretical and experimental aspects of a scientific domain are complex and strongly context-dependent in the sense that they are so rich that any general conclusion from limited case studies may be misleading. The introduction and diffusion of a new instrument in a given domain are important phases of these relations. The objective of this paper is to present a case study that may contribute to our understanding of the role played by instruments in the develop- ment of a scientific domain. Furthermore, the scientific domain we are dealing with, the domain of turbulent reacting flows, also called the domain of turbulent combus- tion, is a borderland domain, constituted at the intersection of two subdisciplines: the chemistry of combustion and the mechanics of turbulence. The borderland nature of the scientific domain investigated here is an interesting feature for our purpose. Indeed, the role of the instruments in such domains is stronger than otherwise for they may contribute to the emergence of an interfield theory to bridge strongly the interacting fields and may help in the growth of the borderland domain as an autonomous research area. The paper is structured around three chapters: the reasons of applied and fun- damental nature that prompted the interactions between combustion chemistry and fluid mechanics of turbulence are first analyzed, and the basic features of the tur- bulent combustion field that emerged from these interactions are summarized. In the second chapter, the experimental problems of the turbulent combustion domain are presented and their relations to theoretical problems are identified. In the third chapter, the developments related to the advent of a new instrument, the laser Dop- pler anemometry (LDA), are identified and discussed. "Representing Experimentation as a Cognitive Process." David Gooding- Science Studies Centre, University of Bath This paper addresses two aspects of scientific experiment: (1) the interaction of practical activity within in a real-time environment with the mental modelling of experimenter's behavior, with the environment, and with the outcomes of ac- tions, and (2) that such activity is often wordless questioning that must be recorded and described with an articulated set of images and concepts. The interactive character requires that the process of experiment articulates new concepts on the basis of tacit and nonverbal knowledge while the account incorporates the results of the process in the form of the very operations, devices, images, and concepts that emerged from the process, including the need to produce an account of it. Can we recover the process from reconstructed accounts of the process? The social-anthropology of the laboratory offers one way of avoiding the reconstructions inherent in scientists' accounts of experimentation. Real-time repetitions and the study of surviving arti- facts can correct and augment operational reconstructions based on manuscripts (and hindsight). Here historians of science and technology can contribute to the cognitive understanding of experiment and invention. Recent attempts to do this, however, encounter the problem of representing these processes.</page><page sequence="46">128 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values I argue that this problem arises from the interactive character of thinking and doing and I develop a notation to represent the interaction of conceptual and material operations in the experimenter's "exploratory space," an activity field in which the Cartesian/epistemic status of material manipulations and conceptual operations is irrelevant at the time they are performed. This status may change, in the same way that choices retrospectively appear as decisions when reconstructed in a rhetorical space. Drawing on the manuscript Diary of Michael Faraday's exploration of elec- tromagnetic phenomena of 1821, I use the notation to draw cognitive maps to repre- sent features of experimentation, including the acquisition of manipulative skill, the reflexive and informal character of reasoning, the utilization of resources drawn from the wider culture, the reformulation of problems whose solutions are relatively unspecified, and the transition from exploratory work to the testing of hypotheses. By rendering thought laden with practice and practice laden with theory more visi- ble, mapping enables comparison of earlier and later versions of experiment and invention and may also enable us to characterize and compare the cognitive styles of scientists and inventors. "The Social Study of Defense Science and Technology." Philip Gummett- Department of Science and Technology Policy, University of Manchester Writers on science policy and science studies have long recognized the impor- tance of war for stimulating change in scientific institutions, in the relations be- tween science and society, and in technological innovation. But the volume of work that is devoted to the study of these matters is small in relation to the scale of the subject. Even smaller is the corpus of work on the impact on science and technology of peacetime defense programs, although, encouragingly, it has grown significantly in the last two or so years. These questions are, however, rising sharply in policy salience in several coun- tries, notably the United States (for example, the OTA study on the Defense Technology Base) and the United Kingdom (for example, the Cabinet Office review of defense research and development). There is a danger, though, of decisions be- ing made without any serious analytical understanding of the basis for them. The purpose of this paper will be to take stock of these developments, to con- sider what issues in the social studies of science they are likely to illuminate, and to suggest what additional work is needed. "Systems Ideas in Science Studies and Science Policy." Edward J. Hackett-Department of Science and Technology Studies, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</page><page sequence="47">Abstracts 129 In the science and science policy communities, it is common to refer to the "science system." As attention has been directed to the adequacy of resources for scientific research and science education, much has been written about whether this "science system" is in the "steady state" and how that equilibrium can be sustained. While these terms from systems theory may be useful shorthand to describe rela- tions among scientists, universities, government agencies, industry, and private sector laboratories, they imply levels of harmony, coordination, and unity of purpose that scarcely resemble science. Consider the idea of a steady state: Is it knowledge pro- duction, manpower development, resource inputs, or economic outputs that are to be "steadied"? A constant level of knowledge output may require increasing levels of resources if the costs of research materials, the complexity of skills, and the pro- pensity to collaborate are increasing. While most analysts treat the inputs to science as the resource to be steadied, from a policy perspective, it may be more sensible to establish a desired level of output, then ask what level of input is needed to sus- tain it. All this is made more complicated when we recognize that universities, disciplines, funding agencies, and scientists experience sharply conflicting demands placed upon them by their multiple constituencies and objectives. Just as individuals experience difficulties when their social roles place heavy or inconsistent demands on them, so too are organizations and systems strained by multiple and inconsistent claims on their energies and resources. Universities today serve the research needs of national defense and economic competitiveness, the knowledge demands of disciplinary development and articulation, and the educational requirements of soci- ety. Thus the resource reductions needed to achieve a steady state may have un- foreseen consequences for the quality, flexibility, and adaptability of science; characteristics that have allowed it to serve multiple objectives and have enhanced its survivability. Also, universities are run by professional managers as well as (sometimes, in- stead of) faculty. Thus academic decisions are driven not only by educational and scientific goals but also by managerial goals, such as growth, increased market share, product specialization, and the like. Moreover, organizations benefit from growth to the extent that it enhances their control of essential resources. To some degree, the founding of research centers and institutes has been driven by such forces. Finally, scientists, centers, research programs within funding agencies, and universities are proactive in creating conditions for their work, resisting attempts by others to reduce their resources. "Earmarked" (pork barrel) grants to univer- sities, often solicited on their behalf by professional lobbyists, are the most obvious and controversial manifestation of this competition. More suitable than conventional systems models of science, in my view, are models that draw on recent work in human and organizational ecology. Not only do such models capture the organized character and resource competitiveness of modem science, but they also better represent the likely consequences of change for science outputs and the cultural climate of science. This paper closes by present- ing an ecological view of science and discussing its merits and implications.</page><page sequence="48">130 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values "Experimental Research and the Social and Intellectual Organization of Science." R. P. Hagendijk- Department of Science Dynamics, Univer- sity of Amsterdam Recent studies of scientific experiments are compared with ethnographic studies of experimental research. This comparison raises questions with regard to the theoretical perspective to be used in social studies of science. Ethnographic studies of science stress the social and constructive dimension of research. Recent studies of experiments like Galison's stress the interplay of experimental and theoretical motives. Both perspectives seem incompatible but can be combined in a more broadly defined conventionalist conception of science that encompasses cognitive and ex- perimental issues as well as the social organization of science. The resulting con- ception of science is multidimensional and distinguishes cognitive and normative rules as well as principles regulating the distribution of resources and authority over their use. Empirically, these dimensions are intertwined in research practices as well as in research careers and the organization of science. Scientific change as well as stability can be analyzed in terms of the interplay of these dimensions in interactions among scientists and with their social environment. "Affective Maximization: A New Model for the Analysis of the Structure of Scientific Theory." Michael Hammond- University of Toronto As individuals try to maximize affective arousal, their social creations take the form of embodied hierarchical differentiations extended over time. This is the pat- tern most likely to secure such arousal. Ideas can mimic this form and key into this deeply appealing physiological arousal. Affectively loaded ideas are sensitive to social scales that shape interaction rates and information exchange among in- dividuals, and thereby shape the likely affective impact. At foraging social scales, dominant ideas are likely to have minimal material embodiment and to stress con- tinuity over change. The divine is an ideal vehicle for this combination. If scale greatly increases, such as in agriculture, material embodiment increases in architec- ture and art, but the core remains divine and nonmaterial and is tied to extensive inequality. The negative costs of extensive inequality eventually stimulate the emergence of otherworldly ideas stressing the promise of a new and better life in a future beyond this world. Next, the failure of such temporally differentiated systems to resolve the problems of extensive inequality leads to the emergence of large numbers of affectively appealing ideas that can consistently change, be hierarchically ordered by progressively replacing each other, and be materially embodied at their very core. These ideas we call science. The material plays an increased role through an emphasis on this-worldly empirical content in theory, methods, and data. Change</page><page sequence="49">Abstracts 131 is pursued such that the most attractive scientific fields are those that constantly create new and measurably better ideas. Thus there are two nonrandom master trends in the evolution of hierarchically differentiated ideas: increasing material embodi- ment and increasing temporal differentiation. Rare earlier in history, science even- tually becomes more common, in part as a means to increase the likelihood of af- fective arousal for its adherents through such patterning. "Sense and Nonsense of Constructivism." Hans Harbers-Science Studies Unit, State University, Groningen The constructivist research program within science studies has yielded many substantial insights into the development of science. On the other hand, the heuristic of this program systematically excludes several important research questions. Such a balance of pros and cons of constructivism should be drawn up on three levels. On the epistemological level, constructivism has added a great deal to the relativization of dominant ideas about science, truth, and rationality. On the methodological level, constructivism may have functioned as an eye-opener for those sociologists of science who were not yet acquainted with the problem of hermeneutics in social science research. Adequate solutions for this problem are not offered, however. On the sociological level, the constructivist research program is the least suc- cessful because its positive heuristic is confined to showing interpretive flexibility. Philosophical answers on the question of how the development of science is structured-answers in terms of Reality, Truth, or Rationality-are criticized ap- propriately. But this criticism is formulated in a way that makes more sociological answers on the same question impossible as well-answers in terms of Society, In- terests, or Power. These statements concerning constructivism will be defended by reviewing re- cent studies within the constructivist approach. At the same time, sociologically more adequate alternatives for social studies of science will be suggested. "The Evaluation of Manuscripts Submitted to Three Scientific Journals." Lowell L. Hargens-University of Illinois By evaluating and publishing submitted manuscripts, scientific journals play a key role in scientific communities by (1) certifying additions to the scientific literature and (2) establishing individuals' claims to priority and recognition. Despite their importance, however, there have been only a few studies about how journals ac- tually evaluate submissions. This paper reports results from a detailed comparative analysis of manuscript evaluation at three major U.S. journals: Astrophysical Jour-</page><page sequence="50">132 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values nal, American Sociological Review, and Physiological Zoology. The three journals were chosen to represent variation in rejection rates and journal decision structure (one initial referee versus multiple initial referees). Data for cohorts of manuscripts submitted to each journal were collected, including information on referee recom- mendations and editorial decisions, various time lags in the evaluation procedure, and the manuscripts' final dispositions. The data show substantial differences be- tween the three journals on many variables. These differences can be interpreted in terms of differential adherence to "the positivist ideal" (Hagstrom 1965), and disciplinary differences in consensus over appropriate theories, methods, and research questions. I also discuss the relation of some of these findings to recent developments in cognitive psychology and decision making. "The Medical Construction of Transsexualism." Stephan Hirschauer- Center for Science Studies, University of Bielefeld The "laboratory" of this ethnographic field study is a treatment program of transsexuality. The paper focuses on the triangular relation between disease, diagnosis, and treatment in the "normalizing sciences" that are involved in a sex change. If we consider the trajectory of patients, we find that their "transsexual- ity" appears to be preconstructed through scientific knowledge guiding the self- selection of the "object." Changing diagnostic labels in a phase of referrals ends in the empowerment as "true transsexual." The paper shows that the somatic disciplines, in trying to take this diagnostic fact for granted, are at the same time involved in a verification of the diagnosis. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic treat- ment of the object are identical procedures. The conclusion is that a "transsexual" is a local bound phenomenon that exists socially only after entering and before leaving the treatment program of "transsexuality." "Institutional Migration and New Intellectual Innovations: A Self- Exemplifying Case Study." Paul Hoch- University of Warwick I will apply the model of institutional migration as a central factor in new scien- tific discovery (which I recently published in Minerva, 28) to the precise institu- tional migrations and new intellectual interactions that led me to propose this model. This will include my wanderings from Canada to the British universities of Aston, Warwick, Sussex, and Cambridge-as well as contacts with various people along the way including Edward Shils, Marie Jahoda, and others. My own migratory situa- tion thereby helped synthesize the various particular knowledges that led to an awareness of the role of such migrations in new intellectual innovation. I will also compare my own migrations and synthesis with those of other formulators of new</page><page sequence="51">Abstracts 133 scientific paradigms that have, in embryo, served as the basis for the congealing of new scientific specialties like the Sommerfeld school of theoretical physics, the Mott and Slater schools of solid state physics, and the Watson-Crick synthesis at the borderlands of protein crystallography and phage genetics. "Science Policy and the Effort to Re-Structure British Universities." Paul K. Hoch-Science Policy and Innovation Research Unit, University of Warwick This paper considers the background of the U.K. Advisory Board for the Research Councils' proposals to channel the bulk of university science research allocations through new interdisciplinary University Research Centres (URCs) in research areas of potential strategic economic exploitability, for the most part in selected research universities within a proposed three-tier university system. The proposals are set against the background of Britain's declining economic competitiveness, higher education's present need to justify itself to government in increasingly utilitarian terms, and the ABRC's plans for stretching limited resources by further concen- trating university science and scientific research in fewer departments and centers. The origins of the URC model are examined and related to similar centers now being introduced in America. Mobility between the URCs and university depart- ments is seen as a key issue, as is the question of whether a balance of resources can be maintained between the two. The relations between URCs, industry, and the new Centre for Exploitable Science and Technology is also seen as important. A sensitive issue is whether or not the sort of concentration and redirection of research resources envisioned by the ABRC will result in long-term distortions of scientific development-and of the overall intellectual directions, shape, and standing of British universities. "Reflexive Sociology and the Reflection of Scientists." John Hultberg- Department of Theory of Science-and Goran Sundqvist- Department of Sociology, University of Goteborg Today, reflexive sociology is one of the dominating perspectives in Science Studies. Interesting insights into the nature of science have been revealed by dif- ferent advocates of a reflexive sociology. For example, scientists construct an ac- count of scientific statements in accordance with various strategic aims. But the perspective also implies obvious limits that are common to most types of individual- and action-oriented sociologies. An example is the refusal to discuss questions con- cerning epistemology, social structure, and methodology. Such questions never- theless arise when we as sociologists of science have to explain the procedures that</page><page sequence="52">134 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values form the basis for scientific statements. We argue that even though it is not possible to find any absolute points of reference in the classical epistemological sense, this does not mean that we must limit our study of science to local linguistic contexts. Social, ideological, or cognitive constraints at various levels constitute an active force that must be incorporated in an analysis of how scientists talk about science, and of our understanding of it. These questions are illustrated with material from two case studies. The first deals with Swedish environmental researchers' views on the official environmental debate in Sweden today, and how they participate in it. The second deals with how the scientific practice constituting scientific statements is presented in the novels of C. P. Snow, as an example of the "new men" of the scientific industrialization. While the first case study primarily uses interview material, the second deals with reconstructions in the form of the narrative text. From this material, we will argue that it is possible to use parts of reflexive sociology without being engulfed by its limitations. "Deliberate Release of Genetically Altered Organisms in the Environment: Entrenchment of Technology in an Interactive Process." Jaap Jelsmaw Center for Studies on Problems of Science and Society, "De Boerderij, " University of Twente The closure of risk issues is one of the prerequisites for the social entrenchment of technology. Such closure can be conceived of as a social learning process in which, as a result of the interaction of actors, technology is "domesticated" in such a way that it can stabilize or "entrench" itself. That is, for the time being, its smooth development is guaranteed by fixed and more or less socially accepted meanings, procedures, and instrumentations. The management of such learning processes is often poor, and the outcome is seldom satisfying for most of the actors. For in- stance, social conflicts about technological risks are often rooted in the different meanings the matter has for different actors from different cultural backgrounds; these differences are seldom recognized and acted upon in the policymaking process. From this perspective, the paper looks into the controversy in the United States about the deliberate release of genetically altered organisms in the environment. In the course of this controversy, the control of the scientists over an important class of safety issues in biotechnology has been transferred to governmental bodies. In the paper, the emergence of different meanings that the controversy has for dif- ferent actor-groups is analyzed. One of the factors studied is whether experiences of actors in the debate of the 1970s about the risks of recombinant DNA experiments in the laboratory play a role in how these actors interpret what happens in the con- troversy about deliberate release. Another subject of analysis is the process of in- teraction between actor-groups in which new regulation is constructed and the</page><page sequence="53">Abstracts 135 technology is modified. At the end of the paper, the closure process is evaluated with respect to its management and in the light of its outcome. This evaluation leads to conclusions with relevance for technology policy. "Early German Sociologists 1909-1934 as an Indicator of German Political Culture." Dirk Kisler-Institut far Soziologie, Universitat Hamburg Putting the results of the research on the origins and the development of early German sociology in the context of the results of the research on German Political Culture provides the opportunity to initiate a sociological analysis that avoids the simplifying assumption of an integration of sociological thinking into a presupposed "Zeitgeist." Analyzing early German sociology by referring to German Political Culture, however, points to a number of new problems resulting from the problematic state of the paradigm of Political Culture. The question of the relation of German Political Culture and early German sociology can be answered as follows: A specific and relevant sector of the general Political Culture in Germany was reflected in the conceptions of society and its future that early German sociologists had formed. On the other hand, early German sociology itself did-in a relevant way-partake in influencing and shaping the development of this general Political Culture by introducing and propagating its concepts of society and its future development by the popularization of sociological terms and concepts. "Game-Theory and the Analysis of Technology Policy." Otto Keck- Science Center Berlin for Social Research, Berlin Information advantages of firms over government are an important cause of policy failures in government-financed technology. Using a game-theory model, such failures can be reconstructed as a situation, analogous to the prisoner's dilemma, in which individual rational action results in an outcome that is suboptimal for both industry and government. By logic of economic theory, any pareto-deficient infor- mation asymmetry between industry and government qualifies as market failure. The resulting policy failure, therefore, represents a case of government failure joined with market failure. The game-theory model opens a new perspective on the role of social science research in technology policy and on the use of rational choice approaches in the social study of technology.</page><page sequence="54">136 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values "Does Feminist Technology Assessment Make Sense? The Emerging Case of the New Reproductive Technologies." Marta Kirejczyk-Free Univer- sity, Amsterdam, and University of Twente Feminist critics of technology perceive the underrepresentation of women in the field of technology as a reflection of asymmetric power relations between the sexes in society at large. As a consequence of this situation, technology embodies male perceptions of problems and offers male solutions. These male-value-biased tech- nologies have a differential impact on men and women. The new reproductive tech- nologies (NRTs) are no exception. They promise a technical solution to the largely socially defined problem of infertility. As a result of a growing awareness of the general public and of the govern- ments regarding the unforeseen negative effects of technologies, Technology Assess- ment (TA) is becoming a focus of renewed attention. Among the many conceptions of TA, one offers some prospects for developing a feminist approach. It stresses the importance of nontechnological aspects related to the development and introduc- tion of a particular technology and of opinions held by groups which will possibly be affected by the assessed technology. A lively feminist debate that is taking place on the significance of NRTs for women's emancipation highlights some of the issues that should be taken up by feminist TA. These are -freedom of reproductive choice, -changing the balance of power between the sexes in the sphere of reproduction, -the patriarchal role of the State, -meanings of motherhood, -use of the female body for scientific investigations, -health hazards for women and children, and -the commercial character of the NRTs. By making an attempt to assess the impact of NRTs on women from a feminist perspective, the first step can be taken on the road of getting women's issues ac- cepted in the mainstream of TA. "A Feminist Approach to the Design of Technology." Anette Kolmos- Institute of Development and Planning, University of Aalborg Discussing methodology and theory development in science and technology from a feminist point of view is important. During the very last years, feminists have criticized science and technology. In the studies of science, the process of research has been one of the main topics. In the studies of technology, there has been a focus</page><page sequence="55">Abstracts 137 on women as users. There have not been any feminist studies approaching the design of technology, however. Feminist criticism must enter this level, if we are going to make any proactive assessments, not only reactive studies, concerning the im- pact of technology based on women as users. This will be a challenge for research in the 1990s. My article deals with the question, "What is the definition of technological knowledge?" Knowledge is not only intertwined with power, but is also the funda- ment for design and construction of technology. Traditionally, we define technological knowledge by the elements applied science and practical experience. Both elements will occur in the technical process of cognition. The extension of the elements, however, depends on the exact area of engineering. In connection with this traditional definition of knowledge, we find an internal ideology-on both societal and individual levels. This ideology is pervaded by a defense of a technical interest as the starting point excluding needs of society and users' experiences. From a critical point of view, technological knowledge must include a third element: knowledge concerning society and humanism. A special feminist demand of this knowledge is equality both on a level of the division of labor market and on a level of ideology and values. These elements must be included in every analysis of the problems that technological development intends to solve, unless technological development con- tinues to be isolated and tends to being deterministic. "Female Disadvantages in Science." Katalin Koncz-Karl Marx Univer- sity of Economics The proportion of women in the field of science is low in Hungary, too. While 58% of the intellectually active earners are women, the percentage of women employees in science is 34%. Hidden behind the average remains the fact that the participation rates of women at the higher level of scientific work are falling. The proportion of women is low in particular on the top of the scientific hierarchy. The proportion of women having scientific degrees is lower than that of men, and only a few women are academicians. The declining activity rates of women at the higher hierarchic levels of science are a manifestation of their disadvantageous labor market position. The disadvan- tages of women have a historical/social origin. The direct cause of the reproduc- tion of this disadvantage is that the limited possibilities of women, stemming from their position-from the inadequate conditions for performing a double function (paid work and family-household tasks)-prevent them from fulfilling their workplace requirements. Owing to the deficiencies of the conditions needed to fulfill both tasks, the clash of the two requirements is most significant at the higher levels of the hierarchy. The occupations having higher social prestige than the average attract the work- ing people in a better labor market position: men. The occupations with less favorable</page><page sequence="56">138 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values conditions offer massive job opportunities for women. The consequence of this dif- ference is the segregation of the labor market by sexes. The occupational segrega- tion is kept up by the mechanisms of the labor market, which are transmitted and reinforced by the socialization process. The feminized careers are conceived and fixed in social consciousness as occupations destined for women from the outset. Socialization transmits and reproduces the values established in the course of the division of labor, which is realized in practice by the girl's career orientation. "Computing Regimes in the Netherlands: The Case of the PTT." Eda Kranakis-Department of Science Dynamics, University of Amsterdam The aim of this paper is to relate the technical evolution of computers to the changing organizational contexts in which they were used. That is, we will analyze computing not merely as a technical activity, but also as an organized, social ac- tivity. And we will analyze regimes of computing, assumed to consist of specific machines utilized for specific purposes within specific organizational frameworks. This approach avoids an artificial dichotomy between "technologies" and "social effects." It also raises new questions. For example, it is evident that computer designers and users had definite expectations about how this technology would fit within the structure of existing computing regimes (based on desk-top accounting machines and so on). But were these expectations fulfilled, or did computers come to play new, unforeseen sociotechnical roles? And if so, what were they, how did they evolve, and how did they shape the further evolution of computers? More generally, how did the advent of computers influence patterns of work and author- ity within organizations? And how did they influence what was computed, or the way in which data and information were organized and handled? The present paper, which is part of a broader study on computerization in the Netherlands, will address these questions through a case study of computing regimes within the Dutch PTT (Post, Telephone, and Telegraph). By investigating how com- puters became an integral part of the organization and functioning of the PTT, the aim is to get a better idea of the forces involved in the structuring and evolution of computing regimes generally, and how these regimes, in turn, shape the goals and functioning of the institutions in which they are embedded. "Why Are Graphs So Central in Science?" Roger Krohn- Department of Sociology, McGill University This paper concerns the role of graphs in science, and their place among other visual materials, analyzed within an interactive frame of interpretation. That is, the basic features of our perceptual-cognitive system, as well as human cultural con-</page><page sequence="57">Abstracts 139 structions and social relations, must be taken into the account of how we confront and make sense of our natural environment. In a second dimension, the official institutions of science, recently "deconstructed" as irrelevant to the practice of research, must be brought back into the account. We can then see visual materials as also the mediated products of the confrontation of practice and institution in science. Diagrams, graphs, maps, photos, and specimens will be seen to play dif- ferent roles in both the perceptual-cognitive, cultural, social, and environmental interaction and the mediation of the practice versus institution dynamic. A brief history of the development of scientific graphics will throw light on how the analytical difficulties graphs-for example, the scatterplot-helped to overcome, for example, the pervasive human difficulty, or "cognitive limit," in interpreting series of numbers in distributional and probabilistic relationships. Recent develop- ments in computer-aided graphic data analysis ("exploratory data analysis"), ver- sus tests of statistical significance, will relate to our theme of the different role of graphics in pattern finding versus pattern advocacy. The cases examined come from a long-term observer study of limnology, the ecology of fresh water: (1) the construction of graphs in an orthodox and in two alternate interpretations of the "spring bloom" of algae in temperate lakes; (2) the role of computer-aided graphics in the design of further sampling strategy in the study of the "self-thinning rule" in underwater macrophytes; and (3) the use of graphics versus correlational coefficients in the seminar and in the published research reports. "Social Science Research on Technological Hazards: Where Are We and Where Do We Go from Here?" J. Stephen Kroll-Smith, Stephen R. Couch, and Adeline Levine--Departments of Sociology, Penn State and SUNY Buffalo Over 70 articles and books on technological hazards are reviewed. Each reference was coded using a standardized coding sheet. Among the indices coded for were topics, system level, methods, conclusions, and strength and limitations. Several topics quickly emerged as the primary foci of the field and served to organize the section headings of the paper. Among the topics are risk, stress and coping, vic- timization, and the political economy of technological hazards. The review is based on the assumption that the event qualities of technological hazards are qualitatively and, frequently, quantitatively different from the event qualities of natural disasters. The high visibility of a natural disaster ensures a more direct and nonsymbolic effect on human lives and social processes than the fre- quently invisible and uncertain technological hazard that creates a comparatively larger arena for the interplay of environment, symbol, and social structure. Ex- pressed in the literature is the complicated role of the social fabric-the formal and informal web of group affiliations-in both shaping, and being shaped by, collec-</page><page sequence="58">140 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values tive responses to technological crises. Compared to natural disasters, it appears that the interpretation of technological hazards is more profoundly influenced by the social fabric and that the social fabric itself is more profoundly changed by the human- caused calamity. For example, regarding the issue of disaster impact, the literature suggests that the matrix of formal and informal sociocultural relationships and understandings is at greater risk of disruption and transformation from technological, than from natural, calamities. "Women as Developers of Technology-Better Technology for Women." Elin Kvande and Bente Rasmussen-Institute of Social Research in In- dustry, Norway Women are grossly underrepresented as professionals in technology develop- ment and introduction of new technology in all areas of modern society. Apart from the argument of equal opportunity, there has been another argument to increase the number of girls and women in technical education and technical professions. This argument follows the assumption that women and men have different experiences in life and different values. Therefore, women technologists will develop and in- troduce technical systems and solutions to problems that are different from the ones that men will come up with. In the discussion, women have been said to develop "soft" technology versus male "hard" technology, or holistic technology versus male fragmented technology. We will, in our paper, put forward another type of argument in the discussion of the prospect of an increase in women in technology. Our argument is as follows: Women technologists have the capacity to develop a better technology for women workers (and male workers as well) because (1) they are explicitly oriented toward the users of the technology and their needs; (2) they have, as women, developed skills in cooperation, such as other-orientation (the ability to listen and to interpret other peoples' needs and problems); and (3) they want and value team-work where they can work with different occupations as equals departing from different experience and qualifications. Our argument is based on data from a project on women engineers in Norwegian corporations where we have compared men and women engineers. In our paper, we will present data to discuss this argument. "Age and Scientific Productivity: Differences between Fields of Learn- ing." Svein Kyvik- Institute for Studies in Research and Higher Educa- tion, the Norwegian Research Council for Science and the Humanities The paper analyzes the relationship between age and scientific productivity at Norwegian universities. Cross-sectional data indicate that publishing activity reaches</page><page sequence="59">Abstracts 141 a peak in the 45- to 49-year-old age group and declines by 30% among researchers over 60 years old. Large differences exist, however, between fields of learning. In the social sciences, productivity remains more or less at the same level in all age groups. In the humanities, publishing activity declines in the 55- to 59-year-old age group, but it reaches a new peak in the group 60 years old and older. Produc- tivity declines in the medical sciences among faculty members who are older than 55, while in the natural sciences, productivity continually decreases with increas- ing age. This paper suggests that the differences between the various fields of learning arise from corresponding differences in the development of scientific disciplines. In fields where the production of new knowledge is fast and where new scientific methods and equipment are continuously introduced, researchers may have prob- lems coping and thus become obsolescent. In fields where knowledge production occurs at a slower pace, for example, the social sciences and the humanities, facul- ty may be productive throughout their careers. This explanation gains further sup- port when looking at various natural and medical science disciplines. Older faculty members in physics are less productive than older researchers in mathematics, and older scientists in biomedicine are less productive than their colleagues of the same age in social medicine. "Productivity Differences between Male and Female Researchers." Svein Kyvik-Institute for Studies in Research and Higher Education, the Norwegian Research Council for Science and the Humanities Virtually all studies on scientific productivity and gender have found that men publish more than women. This paper tries to analyze why these differences exist. It is based on a questionnaire study among tenured faculty at Norwegian univer- sities. We find that women researchers publish 30% fewer articles and books than their male colleagues. This difference in productivity is considerably reduced, however, when controls are done for academic position. Female professors publish more than male associate professors, and female associate professors publish more than male assistant professors. Several factors that may account for the remaining differences are examined: time used for research, family status communication with colleagues, financial sup- port, assistance by graduate students, and intellectual abilities as measured by high school and university graduation marks. Family status shows up as the critical fac- tor. One result, which corroborates those of former studies, is that women with children are more productive than childless women. The most important finding is, however, the impact of children's age on productivity. While women with children less than ten years of age are considerably less productive than their male counter- parts, women with all their children over the age of ten are as productive as men in the same family situation and academic positions.</page><page sequence="60">142 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values "The STOA Experiment in the European Parliament." Gordon J. Lake- European Parliament In recent years, there has been a growing perception in a number of democratically elected national parliaments that traditional parliamentary "amateurism" is no longer able to deal adequately with the problems generated by the development of highly complex science and technology. This trend has been reinforced by the growing realization that scientific and technological expertise does not simply offer com- pletely disinterested and objective truths when used in the political arena. Parliamen- tarians are no longer entirely confident in the advice they receive from the executive branch of government in the realm of scientific and technological choice. Of par- ticular concern has been the problem of "devolved policymaking," whereby routine operational decisions by the executive branch effectively steer the overall policy choices that are the sovereign responsibility of the government/legislative branch. It is, therefore, interesting for parliamentarians to ask just where and by whom policy decisions are taken concerning complex technological projects, or concerning the control of hazardous chemicals, or other policy areas involving the deployment of scientific and technological expertise; and whether adequate democratic control of such policymaking is present. Similar concerns to these, which lay behind the establishment of the U.S. Con- gress OTA, led to the establishment of an experimental project in technology assess- ment in the EP, for a trial period of 18 months from March 1987. The project's acronym is STOA (Scientific and Technological Options Assessment). The political impetus for this initiative came from the adoption of the LINKOHR report on the "establishment of a European Parliament office for Scientific and Technological Option Assessment" on 10 October 19851. This paper examines the experience of the STOA pilot phase, and explores differing views on the future role of technology assessment in the European Parliament.

Laverdiere-Science Studies Centre, Univer- sity of Bath Consensus is usually seen as a worthy goal not only in itself, as essential to the whole project of science, but also as being the main characteristic that founds science's legitimacy, power of conviction, and, therefore, influence on the "outside world." What a surprise, then, for the researcher, when, doing fieldwork on the theme of</page><page sequence="61">Abstracts 143 consensus formation, she discovers some instances where nonconsensus and am- biguity are not only tolerated but even sought after! This paper will deal with two such instances, both involving relations between science and the public: a Consen- sus Development Conference on screening for fetal and genetic abnormality, held in London last November, and the carbon dating of the Shroud of Turin. In the first case, controversy was sought after in order not to give the impres- sion that the conference was one-sided (and, as one of the participants said, "it is difficult to manufacture controversy"). Furthermore, ambiguity on the actual con- troversial issues was perceived as a means to facilitate the passage and diffusion of the overall "message." As for the carbon dating of the Shroud of Turin follow- ing changes in the previously agreed protocol, changes that may impair the credibility of the results, some scientists have suggested that the authority concerned may not wish to have a unambiguous result. On the other hand, even if most of the scientists are not too happy with those modifications, they all willingly kept in the protocol some areas of uncertainty regarding problematic parts of the test, mainly concern- ing the crucial question of the chemical pretreatment of the samples. Those situations will be discussed in the light not only of the relations between science and the public, but also in that of the fragmentation of scientific commun- ity. And we should ask "To what extent does science need consensus?" bearing in mind the comment of one of the participants in the Consensus Development Con- ference that "maybe 'do-as-you-like' would be the ultimate consensus." "The Latest Development Features in the Relations between Science and Production in Finnish Industry." Tarmo Lemola- Technical Research Centre of Finland (VT/)-and Raimo Lovio-The Finnish National Fund for Research and Development (Sitra) In our paper, we focus on the following questions: How is the high-tech industry of a small industrialized country arranging the relations between its science and its industry? What kinds of impacts will these arrangements have on the national research system? The paper is based on our nearly completed survey of the Finnish electronics industry. Research and development has constituted an important tool in the reform and internationalization strategy of Finnish companies. The volume of the research and development activity of the corporate sector, indeed, almost doubled from 1981 to 1987. Most of the activity continues to be focused on product development. There is a new phase of vigorous increase of interest in scientific research and in the training of researchers. In terms of organization and the division of labor, the basic aim has been to increase the self-sufficiency of companies with respect to research and develop- ment. A second element, closely linked with the former, has consisted of national research programs, the planning and implementation of which has taken place through</page><page sequence="62">144 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values cooperation among companies, institutions of higher education, and research in- stitutes. Making national cooperation broader and more profound has been viewed as being necessary for economic reasons and also because competitor countries have embarked upon similar measures. The latest phase, and at the same time the phase with the most important ef- fects, has been the internationalization of the research and development activity of companies. This has meant, on one hand, an active participation by companies in cooperation arrangements such as the Eureka and EC research programs and, on the other, the achievement of bilateral research cooperation with other countries and with multinational companies. In many cases, such cooperation is focused on research having a basic research character. The points of departure for this cooperation are also often financial; the fact that research and development is becoming more costly is forcing even mutually competing companies to engage in cooperation. Another important motive, especially for small countries, is to increase contacts and to get in touch with the forefront of strategic research. The prerequisite is, however, that the companies of even a small country have knowledge and know-how that are of interest to the other parties. The above-mentioned factors together mean that the research and development strategies of companies oriented toward export markets, and especially of companies operating in high-tech fields, have a stronger effect than previously on the deter- mination of the quantity and content of not only the technology policy but also the science and education policy. In Finland, there is to be expected not only an in- crease in research and development activity but also a greater concentration of resources than previously and a strengthening of integration among the various parts of the national research system. Another important trend, the effects of which have not yet evidenced themselves concretely, is that an increasingly more important proportion of even scientific in- formation has become or is becoming confidential. Information is being exchanged mainly among those parties who are cooperating. In other words, scientific research is becoming more and more a social activity, but simultaneously privatization is the trend in the exploitation of the results. "Engineers as Infrastructure: On Technological Innovation, Heterogeneous Technology and Networks of Competence." Nora Levold- Department of Sociology, University of Trondheim-2and Knut H. S0irensen-Institute for Social Research in Industry, Norway Development of technology has been studied in the context of models that em- phasize very different qualities of the innovation process, for example, characteristics of innovating organizations or the nature of the technology involved (Burns and Stalker 1961; Hughes 1983; Constant 1983). Although several contributions acknowl- edge the importance of having suitable ensembles of different institutions to stimulate</page><page sequence="63">Abstracts 145 technological innovation, they nevertheless tend to neglect this meso-level in their more general approach to technological development. Instead, they either focus on the macro level of science and innovation policy or they concentrate on the micro level of individual organizations (research and development labs, industrial firms, and so on), exploring and diagnosing problems within the organization and its rela- tions to customers. The paper argues the importance of a greater emphasis upon the dynamics of organizational interaction and systems of interorganizational relations with respect to technological innovation/development. The basic idea is that the nature of the systems of technological and related competence is of great importance to innova- tion and diffusion of technology, due to the heterogeneity of technology. The concept of system of competence is used to describe the ensemble of public and private institutions that provides knowledge and technical support in a given industry, for example, research and development laboratories, consulting agencies, public agencies, consulting engineers, suppliers, and customers. The paper reports some preliminary findings of a study based on interviews with engineers and managers in a few Norwegian companies and consulting agencies. It shows how the heterogeneity of technology demands interaction of various forms of competence, and how this interaction is organized. The aim is to chart how knowledge and technical support flow in some segments of Norwegian industry, mostly high-tech companies, and how these flows are related to the horizontal and vertical mobility of Norwegian engineers. "Expert Systems and the Limits of Cognitive Knowledge." Barrie Lipscombe-Science Studies Centre, University of Bath In spite of the recent dramatic growth of research, design, and construction of "Expert Systems" (or Intelligent Knowledge-Based Systems), some observers within the social sciences still doubt the practical potential of these programs to disseminate knowledge to the less skilled user. The problems worrying these social scientists, however, are not related to the technical difficulties surrounding the attempt to automate intelligence, but stem from an alternative conception of the nature of knowledge. Human knowledge, they argue, is both socially and culturally constituted, and always requires interpretation based on shared experience within a tradition. In practical terms, this means that, in order for an expert system to be usable in a domain such as medicine (that is, reliable and safe), its design must incorporate the potential for human repair mechanisms that link formal knowledge with specific contexts. The need for such supports, it is argued, accounts both for the current pessimism surrounding Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) and also for the subtle "shifts of emphasis" that are accompanying the search for "usable" systems. Taking ONCOCIN and QMR as examples, this paper demonstrates that the manifest differences between these systems and their parent programs (MYCIN and</page><page sequence="64">146 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values INTERNIST) hinge on the need to provide the human user with the opportunity to "complete" the systems knowledge. Examples here include the shift from "solu- tions" to "advice"; increased concentration on "accessing" rather than "manipu- lating" knowledge; the movement toward returning "control" to the user; and the advent of new interfacing procedures (such as "critiquing"), which allow the pro- grams to emerge within context. "Philosophizing from the Bedside: The Polish School of Philosophy of Medicine." Ilana Lowy-INSERM U 158, Hopital des Enfants Malades Polish studies of philosophy of medicine belong to the nineteenth-century tradi- tion of philosophical reflections on medical practice. They represent, however, a unique phenomenon: the development of a distinct and coherent school of thought by three consecutive generations of philosophically oriented physicians. The prin- cipal figures of this school were, in the first generation, Tytus Chalubinski (1820-1889); in the second generation, Wladyslaw Bieganski (1857-1917), Edmund Biernacki (1866-1911), and Zygmunt Kramsztyk (1848-1920); and in the third generation, Ludwick Fleck (1897-1961). The Polish school of philosophy of medicine was developed by medical practi- tioners. The leading figures of this school were physicians and not, or not only, scientists. They saw medicine above all as the art of healing; their principal goal was not to learn what diseases are but what can be done about them. For this reason, their reflections were centered on therapy-a much-neglected subject in nineteenth- century medicine. From their practical point of view, they discussed the relation- ships between medical science and the practice of healing, and between reductionism and holism in medicine. Their belief that a physician's role is to deal with patients, not with diseases, brought them to study the specificity of medical questions, the individual character of each illness, the importance of nonbiological (for example, psychological) factors in healing, the normative character of medical knowledge, and the importance of ethical questions in medicine-problems that are still central in the debates in philosophy of medicine today. "Scientific Policy in Brazil: Past, Present and Future." Maria Lucia Maciel-Department of Sociology, University of Bras[lia A brief introduction to the history of scientific policy in Brazil indicates that persistent ideological tendencies and political traditions establish a link between scien- tific institutionalization and political history that still interferes in the present. On the other hand, the new element on the political scene is the general national im-</page><page sequence="65">Abstracts 147 petus to "turn over a new leaf" after 25 years of military rule. This translates into a new rhetoric on development policy-which necessarily includes science and technology-as well as the elaboration of a new constitution for the country (still in progress as we write,) in which science and technology have earned-for the first time-a specific chapter. This process of political-institutional transition occurs within the framework of economic crisis and a newly complex insertion in international capitalism and divi- sion of labor, posing new demands and challenges to scientists and politicians alike. The efforts of the scientific community to spread the awareness of the importance of research for development begin to show their effects, while previously latent, conflicting interests become more apparent. This study points out the social forces represented or manifestly present in the constitutional process-Federal Government, national and transnational industry, civil society (including the scientific community), the armed forces-and in the elaboration of specific policies for science and technology by the transitional govern- ment of President Sarney. Resulting policies and articles being proposed for the constitutional text reveal conflicting forces within the state and within civil society that are reflected in positions adopted with regard to basic versus applied scientific research, funding sources (public versus private), objective and conditions for research, and the relation between science and technology. All these elements together compose a constellation that, in our view, is the starting point of the 1990s in terms of new perspectives for science and technology in Brazil. "Biotechnology Research and Its Legal Description." Peter Keating- Harvard University-Michael Mackenzie- University of Ottawa-and Alberto Cambrosio-Universite du Quebec a Montreal This paper will examine the differences and similarities, as well the interdependen- cies, between the scientific and legal representations of the research process by ex- amining them in two different contexts. The substantive research area is the develop- ment of hybridoma (monoclonal antibodies) technology for application in diagnostic kits. The first context examined is the legal context of patent litigation. Drawing on a recent dispute between two biotechnology companies, and using trial transcripts, scientific literature, and interviews with scientists involved in the trial, we will study how patent attorneys translate the scientists' experience of "easily done," "widely known," "feasible," and "same," into terms such as "obvious to try," "reduc- tion to practice," and "identical." Both vocabularies presuppose distinct yet overlap- ping models of scientific organization and daily practice. The second context is that of the day-to-day work order of a commercial biotechnology company where prod- uct development within an increasingly territorialized (through patents) commer- cial area directs the research agenda. Using data from participant-observation, we</page><page sequence="66">148 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values will show how industrial scientists' organization of the conduct of research (which involves the practical accomplishment of "reproducibility" as a product's charac- teristic) translate the legal representations of the results of their activities. "Regimes of Interdisciplinarity." Robert Maier- University of Utrecht Interdisciplinarity has a great future. This prediction, repeatedly formulated, has not been realized up to now. Recent evaluations of interdisciplinary projects by Levin and Lind (1985), and Kocka (1987), show that interdisciplinarity is not quite impossible, but supposes many conditions of success. The modem system of scientific disciplines, shaped in the last century, still func- tions with remarkable strength. Within this framework, taking into account the varia- tions over time and for different disciplines, one can define different regimes of interdisciplinarity, which indicate the possibilities and difficulties of interdisciplinary projects. These regimes of interdisciplinarity, apart from conditions of funding, recogni- tion, and so on, determine also forms of communication and argumentation. In an analysis of some specific interdisciplinary projects-taking into account the evalua- tions of these projects as well as the published results-particular attention will be given to these communicative and argumentative aspects. One example is the use of everyday language: To some extent, its use is necessary in order to communicate beyond the "disciplinary dialects," but at the same time, its use has to be limited, because everyday language introduces continuously fundamental problems and prevents serious work. Or the problem of mutual definitions: What is to be done when no agreement can be reached on some point because of divergent styles of argumentation? One strategy is to declare such a problem--where no short-time agree- ment is possible--as infested territory, which is then excluded by the project. These regimes of interdisciplinarity are not stable forms of coordination and integration of different disciplines. As there is no general theory of the dynamic of interdisciplinarity in its various forms at our disposition, the concluding remarks will indicate some of the features of this dynamic. "Minorities in Science and Engineering: Where They Are and Where They Are Not." Shirley M. Malcom-American Association for the Advance- ment of Science, OOS In many ways, it is inappropriate to talk about "minorities" in science and engineering, because the patterns of participation are so different in the various groups that are collectively described by the term. The sorting among fields is so vastly different for men and women in these groups.</page><page sequence="67">Abstracts 149 The traditional absence of minorities from prominent leadership roles in the science and engineering community is easily seen when looking at some major policy bodies, such as the National Science Board and the National Academy of Science. This can be explained, in part, by availability, given the size of the groups' doc- toral population from which such advisers are usually sought. Their absence from the policy setting arena is not, however, totally explained by small numbers. This paper will outline some of the possible reasons for the distribution of black, Hispanic, and Asian American men and women in science and engineering. The paper will also address some of the possible explanations for the absence of these groups from science and engineering and from major policy positions. "Science and Industry: The Norwegian Model." Werner Christie Mathisen and Hans Skoie--Institute for Studies in Research and Higher Educa- tion, the Norwegian Research Council for Science and the Humanities In Norway, a strongly social-democratic-influenced welfare state, the ambition to develop and to intervene in industry has often been observed in the postwar period. In this paper, we discuss how industrial research and development may be supported and directed through public resources. Should there be direct or indirect (that is, tax exemptions) support for research and development projects within industry itself or should this support be channeled through government laboratories for industrial research? The industrial structure in Norway (many small- and medium-sized firms) has been an important argument for "the lab approach." How successful has this policy been? We can identify four stages in the develop- ment of these laboratories: (1) the "supply-side" approach in the early postwar period; (2) a reorientation in the 1960s with direct government funding to industry and a more dominant market orientation by the laboratories; (3) the second expan- sion of these laboratories in the early 1980s due to "goodwill agreements" with oil companies; (4) the present situation: greater autonomy for the laboratories as well as an economic squeeze due to increased competition between academia and these labs. In part two of this paper, we refer to a case study about the Centre for Industrial Research, a publicly supported institute that became a foundation in 1985. We focus on the external and internal steering of research at the Centre. Researchers are under crossfire as they receive partly conflicting demands and signals from academic col- leagues and the industrial users of their work. How are these conflicts dealt with at the Centre and what kind of strategies has it adopted? In order to survive a high degree of market dependency in a tough market, the Centre has consciously developed a policy of market orientation. We discuss several elements of this policy and various aspects of the customer-contractor relationship. We conclude by discussing some of the problems in doing research at an institute that is strongly market dependent.</page><page sequence="68">150 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values "Technology: The New Paradigm." Maria Isabel T.P. Mendes-Depart- ment of Sociology, University of Bras~lia World society has gone through significant changes, whose origins lie in scien- tific and technological discoveries dating back to World War II. Discoveries and inventions-particularly in microelectronics, biotechnology, and new materials- transformed the technical-productive base and induced changes in the sociopolitical order of the international capitalistic system, possibly redefining power relations. In changing the input-product matrix, the new scientific-technological base trans- formed efficiency and productivity patterns and opened up new market segments (niches) and research fields. New technologies introduce new dynamics in national industrial parks, restruc- turing social relations on a national and international level. New possibilities emerge for developing countries to penetrate the international order, taking to their advan- tage the opportunities offered by technological changes. But the technical-scientific revolution also produces profound impacts on society and demands political- institutional changes. The new technological paradigm is science-intensive and labor- saving. Peripheral countries present strong social inequalities: high unemployment, barely qualified labor forces, and weak scientific-educational systems. The process of industrialization through import substitution with intense par- ticipation of foreign capital, such as in Brazil, did not generate endogenous integra- tion and articulation between the scientific-technological and productive systems. It is therefore necessary, given the technical-productive paradigm, to discuss Brazil's limits and possibilities for creating endogenous axes of development through selec- tive separation from the international order, thus creating spaces of liberty and autonomy. The focal point of this discussion is the analysis of protectionist policies in in- formatics and microelectronics, on the hypothesis that the creation of an endogenous axis demands a favorable complex of variables: technological--technological changes produce new market niches and possible restructuring of the economy; economic-as a consequence of the above, possibilities for small capital investment with strong scientific content; sociopolitical--possible articulation of civil society around com- mon interests permitting the formulation of a development project; and political- institutional-possibility of transforming the above project into explicit policy. "Diverging Realities May Demand Converging Policies." Marilde Loiola De Menezes-Universite de Paris I The basic objective of this research is to achieve an understanding of Brazilian polices in Science and Technology at the level of governmental planning for the</page><page sequence="69">Abstracts 151 period 1973-1988 by comparing these policies with the policies adopted by the Ministry of Science and Technology in France. We will approach our discussion of this problem from two different angles: theoretical and methodological. From the theoretical viewpoint, the analysis should be centered on two areas: the state in developed capitalistic countries and the state in dependent capitalistic countries. The research will be directed toward a critical analysis of the structural relations between these two types of states, having as our point of reference the development of science and its relationship to the state in Third World countries. The structure of the study takes into account the role of science in advanced capitalism and also includes at the same time an analysis of how science can be seen as a productive force, as an instrument of power and as a mechanism for legitimizing the state's capitalistic dependence. The second domain of the study comprises consideration of the question of the development of science and technology in both types of states through an empirical survey of governmental plans and programs, using as a point of reference the cases of Brazil and France. As a result of the conclusions reached during this study, we can discuss the limits and possibilities of an efficient and relevant policy for scientific and technological development as it concerns one dependent peripheral country. Therefore, we would emphasize the structural constraints that limit such a process (characteristic of dependent formations), envisaging a perspective that also includes the possibility of overcoming or maintaining such structural conditionments, with the objective of creating a Brazilian capacity for both production and tech- nological development inside the country. "The Rhetoric of Technology Transfer." Carolyn R. Miller--North Carolina State University "Technology transfer" is the expression used for the general process of introduc- ing new technology to others; in the technical literature, it is generally seen as a physical process, but it can also be seen as an essentially communicative process. Examples of technology transfer in the literature include the educational innova- tions of kindergarten and the "new math," the diffusion of new birth control methods and agricultural techniques to less developed countries, the establishment of new manufacturing processes in developed countries, and the marketing of consumer products. One fundamental question that arises about this transfer process is a rhetorical one, "cui bono?" or "who benefits?" The suspicion aroused by this ques- tion suggests two ways to look at technology transfer, as an essentially "monologic" process and as an essentially "dialogic" process. The technical literature and the attitudes of the developers of technology that is to be "transferred" tends to be monologic, with only the benefits to the developers and transferrers considered. A dialogic model of technology transfer is suggested by the radical pedagogy of</page><page sequence="70">152 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values Paolo Freire, whose work with "transferring" the "technology" of literacy to Brazilian peasants cares primarily for the benefits to the recipients. This paper will explore both models of technology transfer, seeking the "rhetoric" of each, that is, the assumptions about technology and its users of which each tries to persuade us. "The Rhetoric of Technology Transfer: The Buzzword as Trope and Topos." Carolyn R. Miller--North Carolina State University "Technology transfer" is an important term in a variety of domains-foreign policy, foreign trade, international development, agricultural extension, industry- university collaboration. In general, the term is used to describe the process of getting technology from a point of origin to some fmal use or new application. Because it has taken root conceptually in so many places, the term is of rhetorical interest, for its wide use indicates that it is persuasive and cogent. This paper analyzes the term both as a trope, or metaphor, which is a tool of apprehension, and as a topos, which is a tool of argument. As a trope, the term shows us a way to under- stand a set of events and to see similarities in events that might otherwise look quite unrelated; it also, necessarily, doesn't show us other things, and those absences are also revealing. As a topos, the term helps us understand why a particular way of seeing the world is persuasive to those who use it. This paper examines conflicts that technology transfer encounters in three domains: a conflict between private interests and the public interest in programs to transfer federally funded technology to private industry; a conflict between national security and economic development in foreign relations; and a conflict between cultures in the domain of international development programs. In each domain, "technology transfer" both reveals and argues for a particular version of events, including its own apparent neutrality. This kind of analysis of a single term suggests the power of language in organizing social knowledge about technology. "The Construction and Destruction of a Heterogeneous Network: The Case of High Speed Tool Steel." Thomas J. Misa- Illinois Institute of Technology The case of high speed tool steel (1894-1909) is used to develop an interactive and nonfunctional approach to study technology and science. Drawing on new ar- chival sources, the paper shows how Frederick Taylor constructed an ever-stronger network of heterogeneous elements, translated Bethlehem Steel's "interest" in shop reform to support expensive metal-cutting experiments, and linked his local net- work to a global network of analytical industrial measurement. Yet an absence of</page><page sequence="71">Abstracts 153 scientific elements proved to be a fatal weakness. Using effective scientific arguments in the legal realm, Bethlehem's domestic rivals teamed up with Sheffield steelmasters to nullify the high speed steel patents, and the heterogeneous network consequently unraveled. "Possible Inaccuracies Occurring in Citation Analysis." H. F. Moed and M. Vriens-Science Studies Unit, LISBON-Institute, University of Leiden Citation analysis of scientific articles constitutes an important tool in quantitative studies of science and technology. One can make a distinction between two general perspectives from which citation data are collected: science policy and science studies. With respect to the use of citation analysis, three major issues are at stake: the reliability, the validity, and the applicability of citation measures. In this contribution, we focus on the issue of reliability. How accurate are cita- tion counts to individual scientific articles? Which pitfalls may occur in the process of data collection? To which extent do "random" or "systematic" errors affect the results of the citation analysis? We will analyze errors or variations between target articles and cited references with respect to author names, publication year, volume number, and starting page number. Our set consists of 3000 target articles published in five scientific jour- nals, and 25,000 citations to these articles. Both target and citation data were ob- tained from the Science Citation Index, produced by the Institute for Scientific Information. It appears that in many cases a specific error or variation in a reference to a specific target article occurs more than once. This means that there are several cita- tions to a specific target article that contain the same error or variation. We present evidence that authors, in compiling reference lists, may copy references from reference lists in other articles, and that this is one of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon of "multiple" variations/errors. "The Pacification of Controversies in Medicine: An Attempt to Go beyond War and Peace." Annemarie Mol-Department of Philosophy, Groningen Social studies of scientific knowledge have shown so far a passion for controver- sies. They study "war" and the complex ways in which it is turned into "peace." For a long time, the leading question in this research has been whether it is the theory that "solves more problems," as Lakatos thought, that comes out of a con- troversy winning, or the theory that "connects more allies," as Latour states. Both</page><page sequence="72">154 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values sides disregard the fact that a lot of controversies are never solved, they just get pacified. This paper claims that we must start to study pacification. With medicine as a source of examples, three forms of pacification shall be presented. First, the institutional form: Groups of people holding different views for some reason or another have no need to agree, and thus no need to quarrel, either. They live side by side, each doing things their own way. Second, the splitting up of an object into a set of objects: Before the process of pacification, there are two theories claiming to know one and the same object, afterward there are two objects, each explained by a different theory. Third, the splitting up of the object into aspects: Each of the originally conflicting views is accepted, but none is ac- cepted as sufficient. They are said to reveal different aspects of the object under study and encouraged to cooperate. The advantage of this approach is not simply that it is more adequate. It enables one to open up the solidified unity of "medical knowledge" without having to wait for "hot controversies." By pointing out the tension in pacifications, it is possible to force a way into the tangled network of medicine that is made strong by being eclectic. "Have Science and Technology Paid off in the Third World?" Michael J. Moravcsik-University of Oregon The discussion consists of two parts. In the first, six dimensions of the question in the title of this talk are listed: (1) What effects of science and technology are we considering? (2) How can we assess and measure these effects? (3) What time scale are we considering? (4) What are the cooperating factors in the realization of science and technology and of their impact? (5) What expectations do we nurture regarding science and technology? (6) How do we allocate resources? The second part of the discussion then takes each of these aspects of the overall question and offers a personal assessment of it. In particular, three effects are considered: impact on material life, a source of national pride and morale, and im- pact on the thinking of people. The assessment of each of these is done through a mixture of scientometric indicators and personal, anecdotal experience. The long- term aspects are more heavily weighed than the short-term effects. A number of factors are discussed that should be cooperating with science and technology in realiz- ing their effects but often do not do so. It is claimed that much of the present uncer- tainty about the value of science and technology in the context of the Third World is due to previous naive overoptimism. Finally, it is pointed out that science and technology are relatively very inexpensive in the overall economic structure of a country, and that much more depends on how resources are allocated than on the overall amount earmarked. It is concluded that while there has been a broad range among the various developing countries regarding the success of science and technology, on the average, very much progress has been achieved and, in the next</page><page sequence="73">Abstracts 155 half a century, many of the developing countries are likely to join the presently leading countries in science and technology in the forefronts of these fields. "In Lab and Field: Research Schools at the University of Oxford between the Two World Wars." Jack Morrell-University of Bradford The ancient University of Oxford has long been renowned for its devotion to literae humaniores and to arts subjects in general. The dominance of such subjects was associated with a decentralized collegiate structure, which was inherently con- servative academically. Innovation of any kind had to struggle against habit and change was rarely abrupt. There were very few research schools at Oxford before World War I, but by 1939, they were firmly established and constituted one of several manifestations of Oxford's increased national and international standing in science. How then did this novel departure occur in not just one but several scientific subjects? This paper will demonstrate that Oxford research schools were not homogeneous, but varied widely, ranging from Robinson's school of classical organic chemistry based in the Dyson Perrins laboratory to Elton's ecological Bureau of Animal Popula- tion located mainly in the field. It will also argue that, in an innately conservative university, the rise of research schools in science disturbed the dominance of arts subjects and the structures associated with that hegemony. Research schools arose because they were generated by entrepreneurs who used whatever resources they could muster to pursue their interests. These academic entrepreneurs were adept in securing external funding for their schools. Perhaps the most notable act of en- trepreneurship was Lindemann's recruitment in 1933 of several Breslau low- temperature physicists who made the Clarendon Laboratory famous for its research school in cryogenics. "Weaving the Superfibre Network." Karel Mulder and Philip Vergragt- Chemische Laboratoria, Science and Innovation Policy Studies, Univer- sity of Groningen In this paper, we analyze the development of Twaronr, a strong aramid fiber developed by the Dutch multinational AKZO. The American company Dupont in- troduced the aramid fiber on the market in 1972 under the name of Kevlarr. In 1975, AKZO announced that they would start the pilot-plant production of an aramid fiber with the same properties as Kevlarr. Since 1979, there has been a worldwide patent struggle going on between these companies. In this paper, the development of Twaronr will be described by showing how an actor-network arises within a company, how this network is influenced by the actions of competitors, and how it develops and crosses the company borders. It will be argued that there were two important moments that were seen as goals by the actors:</page><page sequence="74">156 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values -The moment when the researchers claimed they could reproducibly make a fiber for which the marketing department claimed that there was a market. Whether this point had been reached was negotiable. -The moment when the board decided to built a full-scale aramid fiber plant. The internal and external networks had to be strong enough to support such an investment. It appears that, together with the creation of the artifact Twaronr, an actor-network has been created. It has not only been created by the development of the artifact, it also supports the development to such an extent that it provides the dynamics that propel it forward. Thus even at moments when the AKZO board slowed down or even stopped the project, the strength of the network caused the continuation of the project. "Quality Judgments of Journals in the Humanities and the Social Sciences as Scientometric Indicators: A Comparative Study." A. J. Nederhof and R. A. Zwaan- Science Studies Unit, LISBON Institute, University of Leiden For many disciplines in the social sciences and the humanities, evaluation of scholarly output is difficult because of the partial coverage of many (nationally) important journals by the SSCI and the Arts and Humanities Citation Index, paired with a pattern of publication in national or local journals. We studied the use of quality judgments of journals as scientometric indicators for four disciplines in the humanities (general linguistics, general literature, Dutch literature, and Dutch language) and two disciplines in the social and behavioral sciences (experimental psychology and public administration). Evaluations of journals were collected by means of a worldwide mail survey among a sample of 385 scholars in the various fields. Journals were evaluated with regard to the extent that scholars were acquainted with them, fully qualified them as a scientific/scholarly journal, the rating of the scientific quality shown by the journal in recent years, the extent to which journals were read or scanned, and the use of the journal for the research of the scholars. A model is formed that links these and other factors to rankings of the journals. In addition, a comparison was made of the extent to which various forms of journal publication and other forms of scholarly communication were valued. We discuss to what extent the data can be used as scientometric indicators of the quality of the output of individuals and departments. "The Concept of 'Standards' and the Co-Evolution of Artificial Intelligence and Culture." Massimo Negrotti and Danila Bertasio-Institute of Methodology Economics and Statistics, University of Urbino</page><page sequence="75">Abstracts 157 The success of first-generation Expert Systems has produced a great variety of devices, inspired by different logical traditions, performing a lot of different features (in part depending on the programming language used by the designers), requiring the end-user's very different abilities or mental dispositions. Furthermore, the problems linked to knowledge acquisition (for instance that of tacit knowledge) are very far from being solved and the current situation calls for some sort of theoretical and practical solution. All this means that we are com- ing quickly to a new threshold of complexity and, therefore, to a new need of in- tegration by standardization. In this case, the standardization process will involve some kind of preliminary option about human needs concerning information and knowledge, and about ac- tual ways to deal with them. As usual in the history of technology, the new step will be more general at the surface and more specialized internally. We are speaking about a process through which AI devices will be more usable by people if, and only if, the coming standardization will be able to match some natural and cultural human dispositions. Like every other process of standardiza- tion, that coming in the AI field will act as a selector of the most suitable proposal that will eliminate the most inadequate proposal. This happens in a coevolution process in which sudden and random-generated findings in the scientific-technological environment produce, through the market, new starting situations that could or could not be self-amplifying according to human natural or cultural (that is, already evolved and selected) dispositions. In doing so, the new standardization will demonstrate that it is based on a good indirect understanding of the human mind, though until now no established scien- tific finding is at our disposal. In this way, technology (and particularly AI) shows its power in order to allow the discovery of something on human nature. It is able to do so by a sort of rule that sounds as the contrary of the physiology principle "to understand the function of a subsystem, remove it... (by means of a lancet)," adopting the following one "to understand man's dispositions to a new technology, introduce it in his life (by means of the market).' Although aimed at different pur- poses, both strategies are very powerful quasi-experimental ways to get objective evidence about systems that are too complex to investigate analytically. "Consecutive Numbers of Scientific Meetings as a Science Indicator." G. A. Nesvetailov-Department of Science Policy Studies, Institute of Eco- nomics of the BSSR Academy of Sciences The age of a developed scientific trend is an important factor influencing cognitive and applied research productivity. Quantitative methods for analyzing the life cycles of scientific trends are as yet in their initial stages. Analysis of the dynamics of various kinds of scientific meetings (using, for example, their consecutive-series- numbers) may be a tool for tracing scientific evolution. (See G. A. Nesvetailov.</page><page sequence="76">158 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values 1986. Intensification of Academic Science, pp. 68-71. Minsk: Nauka i Tekhnika- in Russian.) This paper presents data on the relative frequencies of series numbers for regular scientific meetings on a world basis in 1985. The graphs in the paper plot the percen- tages of, for example, "first annual" meetings, "second annual" meetings. Plots are drawn from three data sources: -projected meetings (data drawn from the Bulletin of International Scientific Congresses, Conferences and Exhibitions, Moscow, VINITI, 1970 and 1980-in Russian-N = 761); -most important meetings whose proceedings have been published (data drawn from Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings, Institute for Scientific Infor- mation, Philadelphia, PA, 1981, N = 1171); and -published proceedings and materials of scientific conferences and meetings on the natural and technical sciences (data drawn from Proceedings and Materials of Scientific Conferences and Meetings, 1985-1986. Natural and Technical Sciences. 8th edition. 1987. Leningrad-in Russian-N = 462). The distributions vary somewhat depending on the data source used. In general, there are many more meetings in early years of the series than in later. The percen- tages in each plot ascend to about series 4, then drop off gradually, reaching a low plateau at about series 20. The ascending curves in the plots presumably reflect the initial stages of a trend. The first meetings held to discuss emerging trends usually have no series numbers, as their organizers are not sure whether the meeting will start a series. To follow the evolution of the trend, another meeting is needed, and by that time, its title in- cludes a series number. The plots show that, generally, one or two meetings are needed to form the trend. A decrease in frequency of series numbers after the second or third meeting shows that serial meetings on some trends are not held any more. This may reasonably be explained by the fact that no meetings are required as the topics of particular trends have been exhausted. The number of meetings after which half of the series numbers vanish will be called the half-life of world science trends. To determine the half-life as an indicator of the average rate of decay of world science trends, the author has constructed the cumulative distribution of series numbers in 1963, 1970, and 1980, and found their medians with the data from the VINITI Bulletin of International Scientific Con- gresses. Half of the trends appear to decay after six or seven meetings. It is note- worthy that the median value has not changed markedly for the two recent decades. Therefore, the obtained result does not allow us to conclude that the half-life of the trends has become longer (the science revolution has slowed down) or shorter (it has accelerated). The percentage of "young" trends-meetings that have series numbers of 5 or less-is 40% in world science; 60% of meetings have series numbers of 10 or less. More detailed information on the dynamics of scientific trends could be obtained using series numbers of meetings if every event included periodicity information</page><page sequence="77">Abstracts 159 in its title. Then the age structure of the trends for scientific branches, countries, or regions could be estimated for a certain year in terms of the series numbers of meetings. "Indigenous Agricultural Knowledge Systems and Gender Issues in Third World Agricultural Development." Rosalie Huisinga Norem -Depart- ment of Family Environment-Rhonda Yoder, and Yolanda Martin- International Development Studies, Iowa State University From an indigenous agricultural knowledge systems perspective, this paper ex- amines the implications of two statements: -Women play important roles in food production, processing, preservation, and preparation, as operators of their own farms, as workers in family enterprises, as farm wage laborers, as traders, and as wives and mothers. -Income in the hands of women has a greater immediate impact on household welfare and food security than marginal income increments in the hands of men. The paper then explores the evidence for the following assumptions and their implications for agricultural development: -Male and female indigenous agricultural skills and knowledge cannot substitute for each other, although there are some areas of overlap. -Male and female communication modes and channels are also somewhat separate. -The channels through which men and women exchange or acquire plant material, seeds, credit, and other agricultural inputs are also somewhat separate and cannot wholly substitute for each other. Finally, the paper presents and examines a selection of field research techniques and methods that will help agricultural scientists and extension staff to understand gender variations in indigenous agricultural knowledge and decision-making systems. This understanding will facilitate the participation of women farmers in agricultural research and technology development. "Striking Gold in the '90s: The Discovery of High Tc Superconductivity and Its Consequences." Helga Nowotny and Ulrike Mersits-Institutfiir Wissenschaftstheorie und Wissenschafisforschung, Universitat Wien The recent discovery of high Tc Superconductivity has unleashed a flurry of unprecedented research efforts all around the world, as well as new and rapid flows of information and public (commercial and political) excitement. Funding agencies</page><page sequence="78">160 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values have responded quickly in putting additional resources at the disposal of national research teams while also attempting to induce some mechanisms of coordination. The paper is based on first and preliminary results of an empirical investigation into how research groups and funding agencies have responded to the new challenge and opportunities in Austria, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Switzerland. Questions to be addressed refer to newly emerging patterns of research organiza- tion and forms of cooperation and what they might tell us about the functioning of the science system under conditions of unexpected breakthroughs. In addition, high expectations of rapid technological developments and commercial use linked to the discoveries do not fail to influence the research strategies of research teams nor the planning nor coordination strategies of funding agencies. The paper will begin with a short historical overview attempting to put the breakthrough discovery into perspective and to point out its distinctive features. It will also attempt to answer the question as to what the almost instant creation of a new research field tells us about the more general economic and political con- ditions in which science and technology operate today. "International Development as an Issue in Engineering Ethics." Stewart Oakley-Department of Civil Engineering, California State University, Chico During the last decade, the conventional engineering view that the technology of the industrial nations is the best model for development in the Third World, or for continued prosperity in the industrial countries themselves, has been increas- ingly challenged. Mounting evidence clearly shows that economic growth based on modem industrial technology has not produced adequate social development for the world's poor. As a result, there has been a worldwide interest in developing technological alternatives-often called "appropriate technologies"--that would be more desirable in terms of culture-specific needs and resources. The World Bank, for example, as the world's preeminent international development organization, has shifted its emphasis away from a preoccupation with economic growth through in- dustrial development toward the development of technology and technological capa- city appropriate for the needs of the small farmer, the small entrepreneur, and the urban and rural poor. If the choice of technology implies social consequences, as research and em- pirical evidence indicate, then the social forces that have the power to influence that choice become crucial to the character of development. While many forces, of course, influence decision making, the role of engineering in shaping the form of technological development is most certainly a decisive one. The fact that con- temporary technology based on modern engineering has failed to produce adequate economic and social development for distinct social groups throughout the world raises important ethical questions both about the legitimacy of professional claims</page><page sequence="79">Abstracts 161 of engineers and the actions of engineers in a social context-particularly so when it is considered that engineering, as taught and practiced worldwide, is modeled after its European and American counterparts, and that the engineering profession generally has ignored the issue of appropriate technology and alternatives to development. This paper examines, from the perspective of international development, the social forces that shape the organizational and societal arrangements of engineer- ing, and how these arrangements influence professional claims and the capability of engineers to act for the benefit of different segments of society. It is concluded that the goals engineers serve need to be openly debated and that fundamental changes are necessary for the engineering profession to address the issue of development and appropriate technology. "The Political Regulation of Science at the Russian Research Center of Harvard University: Going beyond the Transepistemic Arena." Charles T. O'Connell-University of California, Los Angeles Although recent research has criticized the "external-internal" distinction that analytically separated science from nonscience as empirically untenable, one area that needs further research and explication is the matter of the regulation of science to conform to particular political parameters. One promising research direction in this area has been indicated by Karin Knorr-Cetina's concept of the "transepistemic arena": by looking at the interactions of scientists with their nonscientific research partners (for example, grant agencies), we can examine the actual influence of ex- trascientific values and interests upon the research process. Knorr-Cetina's idea of transepistemic arenas can be extended, however, to include other nonscientific role- sets and social networks of scientists as sources of "externalist" influences upon the scientific research process. It is not always sufficient to examine the social in- teraction between a scientist and his or her funding agent. There is no theoretical reason why the concept of transepistemic arena should be restricted to the relation- ship between a scientist and those who review his or her research proposal for pur- poses of funding. The concept can be extended to encompass the professional non- scientific role-sets and social networks of a scientist. This extension of the transepistemic idea leads to a methodology of network analysis. One type of net- work analysis that appears promising is the study of the direct and indirect interlocks between scientific organizations and political, corporate, social, and military organiza- tions. Interlocks pinpoint the structural connections of scientists to the external world and indicate the extrascientific values, interests, and ideologies that may influence the direction of scientific work. In addition to the linkages identified through in- terlocks, another methodological tool for the study of the regulation of science is the examination of national police files such as those of the Federal Bureau of In- vestigation (FBI). These data reveal a number of significant points. First, by their</page><page sequence="80">162 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values very existence, they indicate the interest of the state authorities in the politics of science. This interest has resulted in massive files describing the structure and func- tions of university research centers. Second, the police records show an activist role on the part of the state in purging suspected political dissidents from scientific institutions. Third, the files sometimes reveal covert liaison between the FBI and academic administrators for the purpose of purging dissidents. Fourth, the police records also show the sub rosa production of knowledge for state intelligence ser- vices. These theoretical and methodological points are applied to a substantive discus- sion of the social organization and political regulation of Soviet Studies at Harvard's Russian Research Center in the early Cold War era (1947-1954). This discussion examines two types of data: (1) the organizational interlocks between Harvard Uni- versity and the Carnegie Corporation, which funded the Russian Research Center and successfully pressured Harvard to dismiss the Associate Director of the Center, H. Stuart Hughes, for political reasons. The substantive point in this case concerns the external regulation of academic freedom. (2) FBI records pertaining to the Rus- sian Research Center; the substantive points emerging from these files concern the police surveillance of knowledge production and the covert liaison of the Russian Research Center with U.S. State Department Intelligence. "Changing Values and Attitudes of International Agricultural Research Centers toward Indigenous Agricultural Knowledge Systems." Bede Okigbo-International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan-and Kristin Cashman-Department of Agricultural Education, Iowa State University Several complex forces began to emerge on the world scene in the 1960s that resulted in changing values and attitudes toward non-Western peoples and their in- digenous knowledge systems. This was the period when dozens of former colonies around the world moved toward independence. With independence came a reevalua- tion of indigenous cultures and languages. Also in the 1960s, the new network of international agricultural research centers began to be established with a growing emphasis on the importance of small-scale farmers. It is now common knowledge that agricultural production systems are highly location-specific. Horizontal transfer of technologies and production systems from developed countries or elsewhere to Africa has often failed or has been disappoint- ing. Moreover, the various second-generation problems associated with the early green revolution in the late 1960s and 1970s-including inequities in adoption of technology, inadequacies of infrastructure, and unforeseen environmental and ecological effects of the green revolution-have led to major changes in strategy and approaches used in agricultural research. The most important changes in the approach to agricultural research are the development of farming systems research (FSR), which involves a more holistic</page><page sequence="81">Abstracts 163 and systems approach to agriculture and involves interaction among disciplines with economists, sociologists, and anthropologists playing more crucial roles in agri- cultural research than was previously the case. The various stages of farming systems research include a better understanding of the farmer's overall environment, pro- duction systems, input-output relations, and constraints to increased agricultural pro- duction, and adoption of improved technology as the basis for ensuring that new production systems and component technologies are not only more relevant to the farmer's needs and circumstances but are more economically viable, ecologically sound, and socially acceptable. This approach to research involves greater farmer involvement in technology development and testing and evaluation of technologies at the farm level, thereby ensuring feedback to research station scientists and better linkages of research, extension, and the farmer. Since the farming systems approach was pioneered by International Agricultural Centers in participation with national agricultural research systems and agricultural development programs, the FSR approach has resulted in a strategy whereby the traditional production systems and indigenous knowledge systems constitute the foun- dation on which new production systems and component technologies are developed, tested, and more finely tuned to location-specific needs of the small or low-resource farmers who produce most of the food and agricultural exports of the developing countries. The overall result of this approach is the increased appreciation of the role played by indigenous agricultural and decision-making systems in the develop- ment of improved technologies that are more down-to-earth and farmer-friendly, with higher rates of adoption. This paper surveys these new approaches to small-scale farmer participation in agricultural research and development through the various international agricultural research centers. "The Construction of Masculinity and Femininity in the Science of En- docrinology 1920-1940." Nelly Oudshoorn- Department of Women's Studies in Biology, University of Amsterdam Recent feminist studies in the history of biomedical sciences have illustrated that the human body is an important arena for the construction of masculinity and feminin- ity (Representations 1986). In the study of the human body, contemporary ideals of masculinity and femininity are produced and reproduced. This paper deals with an analysis of the construction of masculinity and femininity in the science of en- docrinology. Endocrinologists defined sex on the basis of a new concept: sex hor- mones. The early development of sex endocrinology was directed by the underly- ing assumption of a dualistic conceptualization of sex. On this assumption, the original concept of male and female sex hormones as exclusive sex-specific entities was for- mulated. Since the 1920s, however, the idea of maleness and femaleness as clearly defined endocrine states become a topic of debate in the scientific community. At</page><page sequence="82">164 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values the end of the 1930s, the concept of sex specificity of sex hormones had been transformed into a concept of relative sex specificity. This change in conceptualization provided the biological basis for a new way of thinking about sex. Since the 1930s, scientists conceptualized masculinity and femininity as being separable from the categories male and female, thus constructing a new definition of sex. In this paper, I will address the question of how this change in the conceptualiza- tion of sex can be understood from the cultural and social context of the 1920s and 1930s. I will describe that it was the cultural assumption of sexual duality that struc- tured the initial development of every new line of research as well as the classifica- tion of sex hormones. The impact of this cultural constraint, however, was not the same for the different disciplines involved in endocrinological research. I will argue that it was the influx of biochemists in the emerging field of sex endocrinology that enabled a new conceptualization of sex. Reference Representations (14). 1986. "Sexuality and the Social Body in the Nineteenth Century." Berkeley: University of California Press. "The Manhattan Project and the Origins of French Technocracy." David Pace-Departments of History and West European Studies, Indiana University In late summer and fall of 1945, conservative French intellectuals, such as Fran- coise Mauriac, were convinced that the news of Hiroshima would destroy the positivist dream of a world made perfect through the systematic application of science and technology. But a large segment of the postwar French intelligentsia saw the development of the atomic bomb not as a refutation of the promise of positivism, but rather as the herald of a new "atomic age" in which science would give mankind a greater power over nature. They compared the discovery of atomic energy with that of fire and elaborated utopian fantasies of atomic automobiles, free electrical power, melting the ice caps, and space travel. Many of these technocratically minded intellectuals saw the use of scientific knowledge for the destruction of Hiroshima as a historical accident that did not throw into question the moral purity of science itself. For these intellectuals, the crucial reality of the era was the Manhattan Project, not Hiroshima. In this unprecedented union of business, government, and science, they saw the realization of a dream that had been present in French culture since the days of Saint-Simon and Comte. The "dawn of the atomic age" only gave new urgency to the campaign for massive public investment in science and technology, which French scientists and their sup- porters had been waging since the turn of the century. They quickly identified a greater commitment to science as the only route to France's postwar economic recovery and its return to the status of a great power, and they used the demands</page><page sequence="83">Abstracts 165 of the "atomic age" as new ammunition against such old enemies as the Catholic Church and the military. Thus an analysis of the popular debate concerning atomic energy in the years after Hiroshima reveals that, for most French intellectuals, the "dawn of the atomic era" represented less an attempt to grapple with fundamentally new issues than a continuation of ideological struggles that long antedated the development of atomic physics. "Private Autonomy, State Science, and the Scientists' Movement." Daniel J. Paight-University of California, San Diego Shortly after World War II, large numbers of anxious American nuclear physicists (the Federation of American Scientists--FAS)--sated with Army-administered, Manhattan Project research and already fearful of an armaments race-descended on Washington to "educate" (scientists feel obliged to eschew politics) the Con- gress in the wisdom of subjecting nuclear technology to civilian, international con- trols. And while Congress did pass the bill these scientists supported, it did so only after making the bill hostile to international control and only after making the military a very powerful nuclear player. So in winning, the FAS "educators" lost miserably. But the scientists did not seem to think they had lost, and rather than protesting the mutilation of their favorite bill, they lost interest in politics and let their organiza- tion fall dormant. They did this because the thing they had most immediately wanted to secure- freedom of research-had been granted them even as they "educated" Congress. While educational politics had been unkind to them (and to civilian-international, nuclear controls) the scientists' private, apolitical prospects appeared bright: The military was behaving itself, generously funding nuclear physics and allowing scien- tists to work practically unconstrained. Military "control" of nuclear technology appeared less sinister than ever before. Separated from the "means of science" and valuing the apolitical (and so more noble) autonomy of the individual scientist above all else, the scientists who made up the "scientists' movement" were-under very difficult circumstances-trying to solve a problem that has long plagued modern scientists: how to tap into their benefactors' economic power without losing their autonomy as scientists. These nuclear physicists solved this problem by establishing precarious relations of patronage with an "enlightened" military, but from within which they were utterly powerless. They remain there today. "The First Step of Emigration: From the Hungarian Periphery to the Center." Gabor Pallo-Institute of Physics, Technical University of Budapest</page><page sequence="84">166 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values The migration of scientists from the East European countries to the German universities in the first decades of this century is widely considered as the effect of the scientific center moving to the scientific periphery. Many talented Hungarians left their homeland for Germany at that time as the first step of their emigration, followed by the second step, to the United States in the 1930s. The first step, however, was not only due to the pulling effect of the center but to the push of Hungary as well. The case of Hevesy, Kraman, Szilard, Wigner, and others is recapitulated. Some remarks are made about the impact of the political situation in the center and in the periphery. The term of "emigration" is discussed. "Public and Professional Rhetoric in the Anthropological Society of Lon- don." James ParadiseHumanities Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology One of the interesting developments of the mid-Victorian era in England is the failure of the Anthropological Society of London to sustain itself amid the advanc- ing professionalization of the rival Ethnological Society of London. The issues in this often vociferous battle between rival professional groups were nothing less than the certification of what was to pass as professional, "scientific" discourse about men and women. In the older, philologically inspired Anthropological Society, defini- tion was loose and legitimate discourse concerned itself with a spectrum of cultural and social issues of central interest to contemporary Victorian society. Misogynist and racist characterizations of non-European peoples were rife, yet were also vigorously challenged from within the Society itself. The Ethnological Society, on the other hand, was consolidated around individuals with notions of how normal science proceeded and was allied with "Darwinians" like Lane-Fox, Tylor, and Huxley. This group, associated with the British Association for the Advancement of Science, sought to establish a formal domain of discourse based on considera- tions that were materially generic to humans. In the struggle between these two Victorian groups, we find a graphic instance of how notions of naturalistic discourse about culture and contemporary definitions of natural man were politically and in- tellectually in the making. "Early X-Ray Images of the Chest." Bernike Pasveer- Department of Science Dynamics, University of Amsterdam In this paper, an analysis will be made of the way in which x-ray images of the chest gained authority for the diagnosis of and the knowledge about pulmonary tuberculosis, a process that partly took place in the first decades of the twentieth century. Images, extensively used in medicine, are hardly taken into account in</page><page sequence="85">Abstracts 167 historical analyses of that science. With Martin Rudwick (1976), I think this is due to "the lack of any strong intellectual tradition in which visual modes of communica- tion are accepted as essential for the historical analysis and understanding of scien- tific knowledge." This paper is an attempt to start filling in that blank spot. The discovery of x-rays by Professor Rontgen in 1885 was immediately taken up by professional scientists as well as the lay world. Its possible use for medicine was taken as an immense promise. In internal medicine, however, the attempt to photograph the so-called soft tissues, and to establish ways of interpreting the pic- tures, was a laborious process. In the nineteenth century, pulmonary tuberculosis was usually diagnosed by per- cussion and auscultation, and since 1882, by bacteriological examination of the sputum. To watch and to interpret the shadows of the thorax of the living tuber- culous patient, an entirely new--visual--way of thinking and acting about disease was needed. The changes this diagnostic imaging brought to the disease on the level of theory as well as on the clinical level will be analyzed in the paper. It will be shown, using archives and other sources from British and possibly German and Dutch history of radiology, that the images came to represent a world that was partly shaped by them at the same time.

"Analysis of Recent Developments in Chemical Engineering by Composite Co-Word Analysis." H.P.F. Peters and A.F.J. van Raan-Science Studies Unit, LISBON-Institute, University of Leiden A challenging goal in studies of science and technology is to sense new developments in specific fields. Some researchers claim forecasting capabilities of specific bibliometric techniques, like co-citation and co-word analysis. This paper presents a new approach, based on a specific form of co-word analysis, to monitor recent developments in chemical engineering. We have extracted data from Chemical Abstracts on (1) all publications in nine prestigious chemical engineering journals over a period of ten years, (2) all publications of 20 outstanding scientists in chemical engineering for the same period of time, and (3) all publications in two important conferences. For each of the data sets, we carried out a "two-step word-frequency analysis" for three periods of time: 1978-1980, 1981-1983, and 1984-1986. Words in titles, keywords, and controlled terms of publications were involved in this analysis. After identifying field-characteristic words in the first step, we carried out a second word- frequency analysis for the period 1984 to 1986, to obtain words most frequently</page><page sequence="86">168 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values mentioned with each first-step word. Subsequently, a co-word matrix has been com- posed and displayed by using the multidimensional scaling technique SMACOF. Our assumptions are the following. First, the co-word structure originating from publications in top journals is supposed to be a reflection of the "high-quality mainstream" of chemical engineering. Second, the co-word structure originating from publications written by internationally recognized top scientists reflects the "leading research front." Third, the co-word structure originating from publica- tions of the two top conferences is a reflection of "topical work" in the subfields concerned. The synthesis of these structures into one map will be presented at the conference. "The Institutionalization of Academic Computer Science." Lois S. Peters- Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute-and Henry Etzkowitz- State Univer- sity of New York, Purchase This paper will present the results of a study sponsored by the National Science Foundation on the institutional origins and growth of a modem field of science: computer science. The elaboration and definition of key variables in the institu- tionalization of computer science are reviewed in the context of the following questions. (1) What has been the impact of the heterogeneous origins of computer science on its institutionalization as an academic discipline? (2) What organizational factors facilitated or inhibited the formation and develop- ment of computer science departments? (3) What has been the impact of government agencies and industrial research laboratories on its growth? (4) What is the relationship among primary and secondary departments in the discipline? (5) What factors are currently affecting the growth and maturatUon of the field? (6) What was the effect on computer sciences of competing pressures for funds for computer education, computer research, and computer use for science and engineering? (7) What has been the role of instrument development in the research and sub- ject matter considered to be computer science? (8) What has been the importance of leadership and power structures in the growth and evolution of the field? The relationship between the organizational structure of computer science and its cognitive content is then explored.</page><page sequence="87">Abstracts 169 "Changing Values of Nigerian Scientists and Government Officials towards Indigenous Agricultural Knowledge Systems as a National Resource for Rural Development." Adedotun Phillips, Eniola Adeniyi-Manpower Development Department-S. O. Titilola, and V. A. Adeyeye-Agricul- ture and Rural Development Department, Nigerian Institute of Social and Economic Research Since the early 1970s, the African food crisis, due to failure of African coun- tries to produce enough food to satisfy increasing demands of rapidly increasing populations, has been a major concern worldwide. Countries such as Nigeria that were once food self-sufficient now find themselves spending scarce foreign exchange to purchase food. The hundreds of thousands of small-scale farmers are now being viewed as a national human resource that could assist in increasing food produc- tion. As a result, Nigeria has launched three agricultural development programs- the National Accelerated Food Production Program (NAFPP), Operation Feed the Nation (OFN), and the Green Revolution Program (GRP). Of these campaigns aimed at increased agricultural and food production, achievement of food security, and a higher measure of self-reliance, the most successful has been the NAFPP. The main difference between the NAFPP and the other two programs, which were dis- appointing and ended up more as slogans than effective increased food campaigns, is that the NAFPP involved on-farm research, and farmers' involvement in research, technology, testing, and development through a miniplot on-farm approach as a prelude for selection of relevant production systems and competent technologies that were appropriate to farmers' needs and circumstances, thus enhancing more rapid and widespread adoption. In the NAFPP, time of adoption of new technologies on the farm level was re- duced from eight to three years. For this reason, during the last three years, efforts have been directed to resuscitation and improvement of the NAFPP and an on-farm adaptive research approach. The farming systems research (FSR) approach of the NAFPP results in improved production systems that involve integration of tradi- tional technologies and indigenous knowledge of resource management systems. This approach has resulted in a greater appreciation by agricultural researchers, policymakers, and planners of the importance of indigenous agriculture knowledge systems in agricultural and rural development programs. This paper outlines these important shifts and trends in approaches to the improvement of small-scale farm- ing enterprises in Nigeria. " 'Fury Over Prof's Kidney Call': Telling Stories about Media Stories." Trevor Pinch, Malcolm Ashmore, and Michael Mulkay-Department of Sociology, University of York</page><page sequence="88">170 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values It is rare for a social science to get concerted attention from the mass media. In Britain, the recent crisis over the funding of the National Health Service has in- creasingly drawn health economists into a public debate. This coverage reached a crescendo in 1987 with three peak-hour TV programs devoted to their work. This paper concerns the media coverage between 1985 and 1988 given to British health economists. We show how health economists' discourse is altered, fragmented, and, from their own perspective, often distorted as it is taken over, assessed, and disseminated by the numerous conflicting voices of television and the press. This semantic transformation of health economics is brought about in four ways. First, health economists themselves tend to change their style when they are put in touch with a mass audience. Second, health economists' claims and recommendations are restated, and at the same time reformulated, by the practitioners of the media. Third, the interpretative context is widened and diversified as health economists' views are placed alongside those of other interested, and usually critical, parties. Fourth, the public debate about the economics of the British National Health Service is under- taken within the constraints imposed by the textual formats designed to capture the attention of a large-scale audience and to present issues of public policy in an easily digestible manner. Rather than attempting a conventional textual analysis, we have sought to re- create part of the style and substance of the public debate by reprocessing some of its textual components in accordance with the typographical practices of present- day British journalism. Thus the major part of the paper consists of an arrangement of newspaper clippings and transcriptions from TV and radio programs. The paper ends with our own version of a journalistic report about our own work. "The Rise of French Cancerology." Patrice Pinell and Sylvia Brossat- INSERM U 158, Hopital des Enfants Malades An original feature of French cancerology is the important role played by a net- work of specialized anticancer centers, endowed with a peculiar status that distinguishes them from both private institutions and state-funded hospitals. Their official mandate combines research, patient care, and teaching activities in a way that is unique in French medicine (for example, a single governing body for ad- ministrative and medical matters; therapeutic decisions taken by a multidisciplinary team). Although this status was confirmed by law in 1945, these centers had been founded earlier. Most were set up between 1920 and 1930 under the driving force of a "campaign to fight against cancer" carried out by an organization started in the spring of 1918, the "Ligue Franco-anglo-americaine contre le cancer," (which became the "Ligue Francaise contre le Cancer" in 1927). This organization was to play a critical role in the formulation of a policy with respect to cancer. I propose to describe the beginnings and early development of these anticancer centers in France, on one hand analyzing the social conditions that allowed a new</page><page sequence="89">Abstracts 171 branch of medicine to be created and on the other hand studying the impact that this innovation had in its social context. In addition, by emphasizing the inter- dependence of various groups of people involved in the creation of these centers (physicians and surgeons, research staff, and philanthropic personalities), I aim to show how social interactions both within and outside the medical community have helped to bring diseases formerly ignored by the hospital services into their scope. Finally, I will touch on the way in which the development of cancerology has gone hand in hand with radical changes in our view of cancer, ending in its perception as a "social scourge." "Making Gender/Making Science: Gender Ideology and Boyle's Experi- mental Philosophy." Elizabeth Potter-Hamilton College With gender as a category of analysis, investigation of the published and un- published work of Robert Boyle reveals that he constructed science and gender in mutually informing ways. I argue that Boyle's accomplishments included not only the creation of the experimental method and the lab report, but also and through many of the same discursive maneuvers, the creation of a man and woman appropriate to the new experimental science. The man and woman he constructs are both chaste and modest, but male chastity and modesty are very different from female chastity and modesty. Male chastity allows men to sublimate their desire for women and transform it into desire for divine service; and divine service, Boyle argues, is best achieved through experimental philosophy. Women, on the other hand, are to be chaste and modest in body so that they will not distract men from their divine call- ing. Masculine modesty, as opposed to feminine modesty, is a quality of mind, not of body, a quality essential to the production of facts through experiments. Facts are produced when qualified men witness experiments in person or when they witness experiments vicariously through written reports. Boyle argues that the successful experimenter is modest in these reports, making claims only about the facts and eschewing speculation about their causes. Boyle indicates that women disrupt experimental philosophy, and his work, as well the writings of Hooke and Sprat, make it appear that women are absent from the production of scientific knowledge. Though science, as Boyle conceives it, is a male homosocial institution, however, men's sublimated desire for women con- stitutes men of science as heterosexual, and despite their apparent absence from the experimental production of knowledge, women are always present as the displaced object of the male desire that gives rise to experimental science. "Conceptual Challenges to the Study of Modern Science in Islamic and Judaic Cultures." Yakov M. Rabkin-Departement d'histoire, Univer- site de Montreal</page><page sequence="90">172 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values While arguments continue whether the content of science in non-Western societies should be distinct from science done elsewhere, there is little doubt that studies of science and technology in society (STS) lack conceptual tools that adequately relate to the realities of science in other than Western contexts. Whatever the historical circumstances of the transfer, the arrival of modern science was usually accom- panied by ideologies of scientism and positivism. This makes a distinction between science and scientism essential for understanding the reception of modern science by local cultures. The conflict between religion and science is well documented in the history of science. Yet it has little applicability beyond the Christian, mainly European, realm. The concept of religion made its appearance in the Arabic and Hebrew languages only in the nineteenth century, that is, when science was being imported from the West. In Islam and Judaism, borders between science and religion appear blurred, and one has to resort to more ingenious (and, perhaps, indigenous) concepts to distinguish between "scientific" and "religious" knowledge. A more useful distinction can be made, for example, between transmitted and discovered knowledge. Both kinds of knowledge are essentially cumulative. But they differ significantly with respect to the source of knowledge and, most important, to the legitimacy of its modification. Another distinction that must be made in pursuit of scholarly understanding of science in non-Western societies is the distinction between science and technology. Here the conceptual difference from the West has less to do with beliefs than with historical circumstances and ideological traditions. Western technology was diffused in an aura of scientificity: Science was presented as the basis and ultimate resource of technology. Science was, therefore, made attractive because of, to use the ex- pression of the late Derek De Solla Price, its extrinsic rather than intrinsic value. Reception of science and reception of technology evoked very different responses in non-Western cultures, and these responses need to be understood in their own terms. This paper proposes a few conceptual tools which should facilitate the study of science in Islamic and Judaic civilizations. "Will There Be Room for Normative Inputs in the Study of Science and Technology in the 1990s?" Hans Radder-Department of Philosophy, Free University Since the beginning of the systematic social study of science and technology, ethical or normative premises and goals have often played a considerable part. We may think of Bernal-Polanyi debate of the 1930s, the critique of the student movements in the 1960s, and the views of Marxist or radical scientists and of en- vironmental or feminist critics of science and technology in the 1970s. From, say, 1975 onward, the social study of science and technology has become an established field of research. At the same time, but especially in the 1980s, explicit critical or normative inputs are more and more excluded from this field. Given this state</page><page sequence="91">Abstracts 173 of affairs, I will examine in this paper what prospects there are for reviving the role of normative views in the social study of science and technology. When arguing for a revival of normative inputs, the intention is certainly not to relapse into earlier views such as the abstract normative discussions of philosophers of science and technology or the grandiose theories of history and society of the social philosophers. I think the task is to integrate the achievements of the empirical approach-their more adequate views on the practice of science and technology-- with a normative input based upon the fact that everybody, including professional students of science, is in his or her daily life continually confronted with science and technology and consequently is making implicit or explicit decisions and tak- ing viewpoints toward it all along. In a systematic sense, my hypothesis is that the (mainly justified) criticism of the distinctions between the cognitive and the social or the internal and the external has led to an (unjustified) neglect of normative problems or, worse, to the view that normative questions or approaches of science and technology are meaningless and superfluous. This hypothesis will be supported by means of a discussion of two theoretical views, namely, the relativist social constructivism and the Callon-Latour actor-network theory. Finally, to give concrete form to such a programma of integrating empirical adequacy and normative concern, some ideas will be discussed in more detail, namely, -the relation between micro- and macro-social factors in the study of science and technology, and -the normative relevance of an integration of systems and actor theories. "The Social Construction of Gender-Blind Sociology: A Problem for the Sociology of Science." Hilary Rose--Applied Social Studies, University of Bradford While the social studies of science have generated a rich new scholarship that explores the sex gender system within science (and increasingly makes inroads on the implications of "race"), not least in the cognitive structures of science, the con- tribution of the different disciplines constituting social studies is very different. Most of this engendered work has come from history and increasingly from philosophy. Why has sociology-at least in the anglophone community-remained such a bastion of masculinism? My paper will address this question through the examination of recent work in the sociology of science. "Building a Network for 'PREOP'-Entrepreneurship or Sheer Luck?" Ann Rudinow Stetnan-Department of Sociology, University of Trondheim</page><page sequence="92">174 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values PREOP (Planning of REsources for OPerations) is a prototype production steering system for surgical departments. The idea of developing such a system in Norway was launched over 12 years ago. It took approximately 10 years before the project received any funding. During this period, we cannot, however, observe any changes in strategy on the part of the would-be entrepreneurs. Their eventual success at selling the project seems due to changes effected by other forces upon the field in which they were attempting to build support for PREOP. Suddenly the actors there ac- tually had the interests that PREOP's entrepreneurs had been attempting to mobilize all along. Then followed a two-year development phase during which responsibility for the project was transferred to two systems engineers and a participating hospital. In spite of a number of blunders, the engineers have had some success at building up interest for the project's potential and even some enthusiasm for the prototype as it now stands-both among the initial project supporters and among the potential system users (who are crucial recruits to the network at this stage). Again, their success would seem to be as much a result of lucky accident and/or corrective diplomacy as of wise strategy. In spite of their luck so far, it now seems the project may not succeed in recruiting the next set of crucial actors to its network. Further financing of system develop- ment is not forthcoming unless the systems industry and/or the research program, National Plan of Action for Information Technology (a new actor in PREOP's field) provide it. Although the project has had its application for funding from the na- tional plan rejected, the national plan must nonetheless be seen as an actor within the project's network (and vice versa). For instance, attempts have been made to interest an industrial partner in the project on the basis that success with this project might be a means of obtaining funding through the national plan for some other project at some later date. Similarly, as a positive and/or negative example, PREOP is an actor (if only a minor one) in the national plan's network. In another paper, Trond Buland will be presenting an analysis of the national plan from a network perspective. "The Ecology of Engineered Organisms: Tensions in an Emerging Field." Heleen Sarink- Department of Biology'and Society, Free University Risks associated with releases of genetically engineered organisms outside their physical containment are subject to a lively discussion. Several calls have been made for the development of a new interdisciplinary field, dealing with the ecology of engineered organisms. Many conditions to the emergence of this field seem to be fulfilled: several scientists agreed on the necessity of an interdisciplinary approach, some central questions have been formulated, and financial support seems to be available. There is little evidence, however, of the actual emergence of the field. An important question, therefore, is this: Are there important conditions to be fulfilled for this new field's emergence?</page><page sequence="93">Abstracts 175 Possible constraints for scientists to work in the new field can be extracted from the discussion on the risks associated with releases of engineered organisms. Among the groups participating in this discussion, biotechnologists and ecologists often pre- sent different analyses. Both think their own, specific scientific principles are the only ones relevant in the discussion. These principles differ, because the scientists work at the extreme opposites of the integration level. Both the biotechnologists and the ecologists use arguments, derived from the same biological theories, such as the evolution theory, but their interpretation differs, as do the examples they use to strengthen their arguments. In the discussion, both parties try to delegitimate each other's contribution, and they commit themselves to their own (biotechnological or ecological) concepts. No efforts are made to formulate common scientific concepts. These concepts, however, enable the formulation of research projects. Efforts of boundary-spanners, who are familiar with both the biotechnological and the ecological field, are likely to be ef- fective to overcome this constraint and to enable the new interdisciplinary field to emerge. "The Private Life of Plants: Linnaeus's Sexual System." Londa Schiebinger -Rutgers University and Pennsylvania State University Hermaphroditic plants "castrated" by unnatural mothers. Trees and shrubs clothed in "wedding gowns." Flowers spread as "nuptial beds" for a verdant groom and his cherished bride. Are we reading a memoir of the eighteenth-century Academy of Science, or tales from the boudoir? These are, in fact, the kinds of categories developed by early modem botanists in their attempts to understand the sexuality of plants. The eighteenth century witnesses a fundamental change in the study of the plant kingdom. From the Mid- dle Ages through the Renaissance, there had been one primary reason for studying botany: Plants were used as medicines. In the eighteenth century, however, focus shifted from the medicinal virtues of plants to an abstract and universal method of classification. Botanists studied plant anatomy and physiology in an attempt to pro- vide mechanistic explanations of plant metabolism, reproduction, and movement. Paradoxically, this "scientization" of botany coincided with an ardent "sexualiza- tion" of plants. The political and social circumstances surrounding the sexualiza- tion of the plant kingdom in eighteenth-century society is the topic this study. Today, the language of sexuality persists in explanations of the reproduction of plants. In sexually reproducing plants, the stamen (the male part) produces pollen and the pistil (the female part, consisting of the stigma, style, and ovary) receives that pollen and produces seeds. But why until the early part of the eighteenth cen- tury did few botanist recognize plant reproduction as sexual? Why was it sexuality that became the key to classification? It is interesting to note that, according to the botanist Carl Linnaeus's classification, the number of a plant's pistils determined the order to which it was assigned, while the number of its stamens determined</page><page sequence="94">176 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values its class; in other words, Linnaeus gave male parts priority in determining the status of the organism in the plant kingdom. "One Image Says More Than a Thousand Words." Karl-Heinrich Schmidt -Center for Science Studies, University of Bielefeld The possibility of encoding "facts" or "situations" in written texts is believed to be a necessary condition for the development of science (Husserl, Derrida). In this century, a lot of nontextual possibilities of coding facts play an increasing role in the practical work of scientists; especially, imaging techniques often define the interface between experimental settings and scientists. In this paper, we investigate images that are opening and closing devices for textual (for example, oral) modeling of scientists. This problem is focused on its semantic component: How are images established as "good" or "bad" results? How is the semantic quality of a model evaluated by images? The theory of modeling has developed the two criteria correctness and com- pleteness for the evaluation of the semantic quality of models. Empirical findings in laboratories show that "correctness" of a display is established along a "circle of deixis." According to local criteria, displays are evaluated and transformed as long as a result is considered to be satisfactory. "Completeness" is achieved by a phenomenon that can be described as "visual induction": Only a small number of images (even one) suffices to convince scientists that a model solves the instances of a question for which it is designed. Both phenomena of a "circle of deixis" and "visual induction" are explained by empirical examples. "Analogies and Innovations in Science." R. v. Schomberg-University of Twente The use of analogies can be conceived as a form of plausible reasoning. I make a distinction between the plausibility of arguments and the plausibility of claims. I follow Rescher's proposal that the starting point for the development of a theory of plausibility is the issue of the reliability of the sources that issue or authorize these claims. Whereas Rescher is primarily concerned with the product-aspect of argumentation, I also want to stress the fact that the plausibility of claims depends upon the shared background knowledge of a public to which the arguments are ad- dressed. In such a view, the process-aspect of argumentation is also taken into account. It is argued that a theory of plausibility is needed for an analysis of how innova- tions arise in science. By analyzing analogies, I heavily draw on Peirce's idea of</page><page sequence="95">Abstracts 177 abduction. It is shown that analogies have both the function of normalizing anomalies and the function of innovation in the sense of disclosure of new scientific domains. "The Dynamics of Writing a Proposal." Joop Schopman- Philosophy Department, Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht The processes leading to the foundation of the Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI) at Stanford University have been studied. The creation of this new, interdisciplinary institute in which industries, a profit organization, and the university participate has been a complex event. The period of direct prepara- tion (August 1982 through September 1983) is divisible into two main periods. During the first four months, a group of researchers had to be chosen, and a program had to be defined that could convince the board of the System Develop- ment Foundation (SDF) that the "computational approach of language" is a do- main worth supporting. As a result, not only the board was convinced, but simultaneously a choice had been made for a particular approach of language, and for a group of scientists of Stanford, SRI, and Xerox. The second period-in which the proposal gets written-has been characterized by three main events: -a stabilization had to be reached with regard to the intellectual positions of the participants; -the internal dynamics helped by some external factors created the so-called delta effect, that is, the original group of 4 people grew to a crowd of 100; and -the relation between the applicants and the representative of SDF was a strained one, which was to a large extent due to differences between academic and industrial research traditions. The outcome of the whole process is a $23 million grant for an institute whose foundation has changed the linguistic map of the United States and the intellectual orientation of Stanford's linguistic department. "Technology in Decline: A Search for Useful Concepts." Johan Schot- Center for Technology and Policy Studies-TNO The generally emerging interest in a new type of technology study has resulted in several approaches, like the social construction, network, and system approaches. Already, several cases have been analyzed with help of new proposed concepts. The developments in this field are characterized by a fruitful and stimulating heterogeneity. But there is at least one striking resemblance to locate between these</page><page sequence="96">178 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values approaches. They all study and develop concepts for technology under construc- tion or for growing and evolving systems and/or networks. Technology in use or technology in decline has not received much attention. The aim of my paper is to fill this gap. I want to test and compare the above-mentioned approaches and the proposed concepts on their usefulness to analyze a technology that has arrived at a stage of stasis and entering a period of decline. Furthermore, the result of this discussion will be confronted with theories about diffusion developed within economics. This discussion will not remain at a theoretical level. A case study, the madder industry in the nineteenth century, will be presented as well. The craft-based technology of producing madder was very firmly rooted in some regions of the Netherlands. It was linked to their geography, regulation, and economic and social structure. The basis for this technology was stretched out in the seventeenth cen- tury. In the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was a very fine-tuned and elaborated technology. This technology came under severe pressure because of the development of an industrial mode of production in France. It had to adjust itself to a new situation. The analysis of the process of decline of the old craft-based system and the adaption of a new system will make it possible to assess the viability of the theoretical conclusions made in the first part of the paper. "Critical Science Movement and Science Policy Decision-Making." Dhiren- dra Sharma- Centre for Studies in Science Policy, Jawaharlal Nehru University Major scientific activities today are carried out as part of "defense systems," funded by governments and supported by the collective will of the citizens. Military strategies too have become science dependent, carefully planned, scientifically re- searched, and constantly upgraded for "mutually assured destruction" (MAD) capability. The MAD games are played by highly qualified scientists with conscious clarity and sincere intellectual commitment. What is the role and probable impact of "Critical Science Movement" (CSM) in the decision-making process of governments that have used major scientific research and knowledge for the MAD war-systems? The starting point of the CSM is the declaration of the Russell-Einstein Manifesto issued on the 9 July 1955, in London. The following decades witnessed emergence of critical scientific writings against potentially harmful research activities. Linus Pauling campaigned against "atmospheric nuclear tests," which were subsequently banned under international agreements. Paul Ehrlich raised the question of the "Population Bomb," and discussed its global economic ill consequences. His study encouraged research in genetics and contraception. The scientific criticism of "defoliation and ecological imbalance" caused by chemical warfare in Vietnam was led by E. W. Pfeiffer, which eventually helped discover the problem of "Acid</page><page sequence="97">Abstracts 179 Rains" and led to environmental studies and research. Similarly, Harold Johnston's warning against hazards to the ozone layer prompted new areas of investigations, delayed commercial exploitation of supersonic transport, and prompted necessary legislation and effective industrial actions. It was Zohn Gofman's criticism that slowed down development of the "plutonium fast breeder reactor" system. Constitutions of many national and international regulatory bodies and legislative reforms can be traced to the organized activities of the CSM. The credit goes to the writings of the critical and concerned science policy thinkers. The present study attempts to examine specific case histories indicative of probable impact of the CSM on decision making in science and public policies. It is also intends to show that the CSM has played a significant role in the advancement and improvement of the management of science. "Scientific Disciplines and Economic Development in Less Developed Countries." Yehouda Shenhav and Gili Drori-Tel Aviv University The paper addresses the ongoing debate regarding the relevance of science to the economic realm of developing nations. We argue that the cosmopolitan nature of science and the cultural dependency in the world system dictate the construction of a Western definition of scientific productivity in less developed countries (LDC). The paper analyzes the empirical relationships between nine scientific disciplines and the gross national product in approximately 90 countries during 1973 to 1985. The implications of the results are discussed. "A Typology of Technical Systems." Wesley Shrum and Joan Morris- Louisiana State University Recent discussion of technological systems attends to the seamless web of forces that affect development without providing a theory of the direction it is likely to take. A three-dimensional typology of technical systems is proposed that employs the nature of the output, the size and complexity of the system, and the level of perceived uncertainty to predict political visibility and the number of technical alter- natives considered. "Constructive Technology Assessment: ISDN as an Example." Paul Slaa- Free University The concept of "constructive technology assessment" has been developed from the insight that the way technological innovations are embedded into society depends</page><page sequence="98">180 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values not only on their technical characteristics, but also on the rate to which they are accommodated to social innovations. Technological innovation means technological as well as social transformation. This means that, for an innovation to be successful, it is necessary to have already considered possible social implications and social demands in its design phase. In this sense, technological innovation can be considered as a social learning process, in which new technological developments and their social embedding go hand in hand. Constructive technology assessment is meant to be an instrument to guide this learning process and to intermediate between technological innovations and social objectives. In the paper, the results of a project that aimed to carry out a "constructive technology assessment" on new technological developments in the telecommunica- tions infrastructure, especially the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), are presented. Emphasis is laid on methodological aspects of constructive technology assessment. The usefulness of this new approach of technology assessment for the future is evaluated. "The Role of Risk Analysis in the Decision-Making Process for Major Hazard Sites in the UK." Denis Smith--Department of Business and Management Studies, Trent Polytechnic This paper examines the role of corporate power in the decision-making and regulatory processes for major hazard sites in the United Kingdom. In particular, emphasis is placed on the role of risk analytical techniques and the associated use of technical expertise in the public inquiry process by focusing on two areas, Canvey Island (Essex) and Ellesmere Port (Cheshire). Evidence shows that the ability of public groups to intervene effectively in the decision-making process varies both spatially and temporally. In order to set these data within a theoretical framework, the analysis of public inquiries in these areas takes place in the context of three competing perspectives on power-namely, pluralist, elitist, and Marxist. Through the use of a number of mediating concepts, the three theoretical perspectives on power are married to the empirical data derived for the two areas. The research shows that each of the perspectives fails to provide an adequate explanation for events. Against this background, some of the models of scientific expertise within decision making are evaluated and it is suggested that such models need to be set in a wider economic and social framework than had previously been allowed for by some authors. It is argued that risk analysis can be used to support the interests of power- ful groups and, as a consequence, its validity as an input into decision making needs to be subjected to more critical scrutiny than has previously been the case. The paper concludes by making a number of recommendations for the various bodies involved in making judgments about major hazards.</page><page sequence="99">Abstracts 181 "Application, Acceptance, and Graduate Rates for Black American Medical Students at Majority Medical Schools." Earl Smith- Washington State University The underrepresentation of minorities in medicine continues to be a national con- cern. While a major factor contributing to this problem is the fact that many minority students who have the potential to succeed in medicine go unidentified or become discouraged during the high school years, another factor is that a significant number of minority students in pursuit of medical degrees do not obtain their occupational goals because they are unsuccessful in their initial attempt to gain admission to medical school. Many also drop out of medical school prior to the completion of their course work. Thus the goal of both obtaining and retaining proportionate representation of minority group students in medical school continues to be a challenge for the academic medical community. The purpose of this paper is to describe the ac- complishments of a majority medical schools in their efforts to meet this twofold goal. Specifically, data for a five-year period (1979-1980 to 1983-1984) consisting of the application, admission, and graduation rates of black American students at predominantly nonminority medical schools were analyzed. The results indicate that a small number of majority medical institutions are exhibiting a clear and visible commitment to parity, while the majority of medical schools seem not to be mak- ing any commitment at all. "Social Interests in Science and Technology Research." Fernanda A.F. Sobral This study analyses the social interests that permeate the scientific and technological research in the agrarian and biomedical fields at Brazilian universities and research institutes, based on a theoretical discussion about the relationship be- tween science, technology, and power in peripheral capitalist societies. This ques- tion is analyzed during the period of political transition through different procedures: analysis of laws and government plans and policy, analysis of proposals for the reformulation of these policies coming from the governmental apparatus or from civil society, analysis of federal budget data for science and technology in the 1980, and interviews with researchers from both fields of study and with coordinators of research funding agencies. The study of this material shows that science and technology in Brazil are ar- ticulated with the interests of international accumulation of capital (more clearly so during the authoritarian period, but also true for the period of political transi- tion) as well as with the interests of national autonomy and social development.</page><page sequence="100">182 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values Nevertheless, the interests of national autonomy and social development will in- crease their feasibility with the effective democratization of the Brazilian state and with priority given to scientific and technological research conducted in public in- stitutions. As far as university research is concerned, despite the difficulties for its consolidation, the principle of autonomy that inspires and directs it makes it more capable of fulfilling the interests of national autonomy and social development. "Gender and Technological Research and Development." Knut H. S0rensen- Institute for Social Research in Industry, Norway The paper discusses the phenomenon of genderized technology. It is based on a study of male and female scientists in a large, industrial research and develop- ment institute. It is inspired by a theoretical model developed in a previous paper (Sorensen and Berg 1987), which suggests that genderization of technology may be brought about through three sets of mechanisms: (1) the genderized nature of technological institutions, (2) genderized symbols and symbolism in technology, and (3) genderized styles of thought and work in technological research and develop- ment. These three levels or dimensions of genderization are, of course, related, but relatively independent. Feminist critique of science and technology has resulted in at least three dif- ferent positions: (1) the post-Mertonian view of institutional discrimination, (2) the weak feminist program, implying that science and technology is gendered in the sense that general relations of gender affect both institutional possibilities of men and women and the kind of problems research and development is directed toward, and (3) the strong feminist program, which argues that men and women have dif- ferent styles of work and thought, making male and female epistemologies. The empirical analysis addresses these positions. It is based on a combination of semistructured interviews and survey material. First, the paper compares male and female scientists in terms of access to local resources, possibilities of generating and/or leading projects, and their research interests. Second, a battery of questions are used to analyze feminine and masculine styles of thought related to the research process. The results lead to criticism of the post-Mertonian position, as well as the strong feminist program. "Effects of Changing Research Policy in Various Disciplines."

Through the introduction of the Conditional Finance System (CF) in 1982, faculties were asked to present their research capacity in pro- posals of a certain size and coherence and submit these for external evaluation to disciplinary committees. The conditions, an amalgam of scientific and administrative requirements, were set alike for all disciplines, in spite of obvious differences in research practices. In six case studies in three disciplines (two in humanities, two in natural sciences, and two in social sciences) at four different universities, we found a great variation in research practices with regard to degree of cooperation, time expenditure, and organization and integration of research. In the paper, we will focus on the issue of interaction and cooperation between researchers, the improvement of which is one of the main goals of government policy. The cognitive and social organization of academic work, however, varies through the disciplines and seems to be crucial for the impact external policy incentives can have. As researchers in these disciplines have different conceptions of doing research, it is expected that their reactions will differ in order to cope with a changing research environment. Whether the CF can become a relevant research context or will be judged as no more than administrative nuisance will depend on the successful in- tegration of policy demands within existing working traditions. We will describe this process of "mutual tuning" among disciplinary and ad- ministrative demands on research and the various consequences for the organiza- tion of work in three disciplines. As is suggested in the literature, some disciplines (with high paradigmatic consensus and strong organizational structures) are more capable of resisting policy measures than are others. This will be tested in our paper. "Layered Representations: Computer Chips, Maps of the Brain, and the Coordination of Information." Susan Leigh Star-Department of Infor- mation and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, and Tre- mont Research Institute This paper extends the analysis of visualization recently developed in the sociology of science to the domain of layered representations. In developing this model, I compare the design process for computer chips (VLSI CAD) and the process of mapping the human brain. I rely especially on the model of "visualization and cogni- tion" developed by Latour, to describe the management of information in the crea- tion of complex representations. By layered, I mean that different parts of the design or research process belong to different strata. The process of articulating the rela- tionships between layers is a sociotechnical one. Because the layers are heterogeneous (for example, some are abstract-mathematical or behavioral-some concrete- silicon or flesh), and because they often fall into different work domains, the management of information is difficult. The visual conventions and standardized formulas of both the chip design and the brain mapping process may be optically consistent at any one layer, but as part</page><page sequence="102">184 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values of the larger representation, they are stratified in an inconsistent fashion. This derives from several sources. A layered representation is only partially visible from any one stratum. Any single layer can have the property of either invisibility or partial visibility with respect to another; this is true both literally in examining an artifact such as a computer chip, and processually in analyzing the process of cooperative work. In the production of layered representations, the layers are themselves mobile, in process, shifting, and n-dimensional. There are tensions in the articulation of parts of the representations, precisely because they are not docile, optically consis- tent flat representations nor are they purely formal systems. What is sociologically interesting is the complex division of labor and representational processes reflected in the partitioning of the representations, and the ongoing attempts to keep the work process "doable," to use Fujimura's term. Layered representations are assembled by teams. These teams are composed of members with disparate skills that must be coordinated. The general problem of mapping and design involved in layered representations requires forcing represen- tations of work processes to become combinable and consistent, however briefly and despite the formidable problems of distributed information, partial visibility, and heterogeneity of skills. Teams creating such representations employ a wide reper- toire of strategies to overcome these problems and create the equivalent of an "op- tically consistent" representational language: an "organizationally consistent" representational language that preserves visual and informational continuity. Latour describes a solution to the problems posed by single-layer representa- tions: the invention of perspective and of immutable mobiles. Thus, where optical consistency is the main problem for the period described by Latour, and that is ob- tained by superimposing or combining immutable mobiles, for the layered represen- tational process, consistency across layers is the problem. This is a problem of both cross-sectional and temporal consistency. VLSI CAD chip designers and neuro- physiolgists both invented forms of organizational consistency to meet the problems posed by layered representations. Part of this results in a twinning of commodities and wizards, as they become inseparable parts of the management of information in the layering process. "Plants, Animals and Formulae: Latour and Foucault on Natural History." Dirk Stemerding- University of Twente This paper is concerned with a confrontation between two different accounts of the development of natural history, one taken from Latour's Science in Action, the other from Foucault's The Order of Things. The contrast between these two views on natural history may be formulated as follows. For Latour, the abstract formulas of a classification scheme reflect the growing scale of a network in which a heterogeneous set of statements, things, and phenomena are tied together. Instead</page><page sequence="103">Abstracts 185 of marveling at the abstractions themselves, we have to study the "sociologics" of the manifold activities through which these abstractions are created. Foucault, on the other hand, emphasizes the qualitative aspects of these abstractions. In his view, the historical development of the sciences shows some salient transforma- tions in which the nature of prevalent abstractions radically changes. Now, in light of these two views, two points can be made. First, in his network account, Latour emphasizes the quantitative aspect of scientific change, whereas Foucault, in his epistemological analysis focuses, on the qualitative aspects of scientific change. What we need, however, is a conception of scientific networks in which different types of change-quantitative as well as qualitative-are accounted for. In this respect, Hesse's network model seems to be an interesting candidate. Second, from this point of view, it becomes an intriguing question in how far and in what way we can under- stand the "logic" of different types of change in terms of a Latourian "sociologics." In this paper, this question will be discussed with reference to a critical event in the history of natural history: the transformation of animal classification by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier at the end of the eighteenth century. "The Effect of Cohort on the Productivity of U.S. Physicists." Paula E. Stephan-Georgia State University-and Sharon G. Levin-University of Missouri, St. Louis This paper investigates the relationship between cohort and the publishing pro- ductivity of U.S. educated and employed physicists. Data are taken primarily from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) for the years 1973 through 1979; publica- tion data are from the Science Citation Index produced by the Institute for Scien- tific Information (ISI). Two methods are employed to investigate cohort effects. First, using a broad brush approach, we attempt to isolate cohort effects from aging effects by holding career age constant and varying Ph.D. cohort. In this analysis, all Ph.D. physicists are included, regardless of sector of employment. This analysis shows uniformly that, for the first 10 to 11 years of career age, more recent cohorts are less produc- tive than earlier cohorts. A transition, however, then occurs: For physicists who have been out between 16 to 23 years, the evidence is that earlier cohorts are less productive. Thereafter, the evidence is mixed but leans toward more recent cohorts being more productive. The second approach is to estimate a pooled regression model that, among other factors, controls for both cohort and age. This analysis is performed for three areas of physics: solid state/condensed matter, atomic and molecular, and elementary par- ticle. Although the results of the analysis vary somewhat by subfield, we find some evidence that cohort matters. On the other hand, more recent cohorts are never found to be significantly more productive than earlier cohorts. We conjecture that later cohorts may fail to be more productive than earlier cohorts, not because they lack</page><page sequence="104">186 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values a "knowledge edge," but because they entered the profession when market condi- tions were poor and were forced to take jobs in environments that were less sup- portive of research. Furthermore, later cohorts may fail to be more productive than earlier cohorts because the scientists who obtained doctorates during the period of rapid expansion may have been, on average, not as talented as scientists coming from earlier, smaller, cohorts, which drew from a smaller and perhaps more elite population. "Creating a Scientific Community to Explore the Solar System: How One Government Mobilized a Reluctant Scientific Community in Response to Political and Technological Imperatives." Joseph N. Tatarewicz- National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian Institution The planetary exploration program established as part of the U.S. reaction to Sputnik transformed the study of solar system bodies. While direct access to the planets by space probes set the study of the solar system on a new observational and theoretical footing, such exploration was prosecuted on the basis of renewed ground-based planetary astronomy. U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administra- tion (NASA) planners, when finally convinced of the need to support ground-based planetary astronomy directly, responded with a multifaceted program that transformed the field. Observatories were constructed, instruments acquired, astronomers trained, research programs funded, and many other activities supported, with profound con- sequences for astronomy and for planetary studies. Planetary science emerged as a scientific enterprise whose pace and direction of development ultimately depended on considerations far beyond the scientific desiderata developed by the research community itself, because the ground-based as well as space-based facilities essential to its development were under the control of a government agency responding to more than just scientific imperatives. The relative lack of attention given to planetary astronomy prior to NASA represents an assessment by the astronomical community of what constituted scientifically im- portant and technically feasible research problems worthy of being attacked with the limited resources available. NASA's attempts to stimulate this field, while par- tially motivated by scientific sincerity and a somewhat broader vision concerning the scientific potential of space techniques, represented in some sense interference, an attempt at political control of the research agendas of established scientific communities. This paper presents an assessment of the efficacy and unexpected consequences of the various tactics employed by government agencies to direct the research agendas of several scientific disciplines in support of large-scale technological and political projects.</page><page sequence="105">Abstracts 187 "Sex Differences in Publication Productivity among Norwegian Scientists." Tove Thagaard-Department of Sociology, University of Oslo Why do female scientists publish less than their male colleagues? The present study gives some tentative answers to this question. The data are based on 70 inter- views with Norwegian scientists at the University of Oslo and in institutions of ap- plied research. Results from the present study indicate a persistent but not very great difference between men and women scientists. The average publication rate per year is 2.2 for women and 2.9 for men. How can this difference be explained? Possible differences in publication productivity due to gender differences in rank and tenure are not reflected in this study. The sample represents an equal amount of men and women scientists in different categories of positions. There is a ten- dency, however, for women scientists to be promoted and get tenure more slowly than men. Cases of discrimination are reported, both concerning attainment and within the formal setting of the work context. Within the informal scientific net- works, however, women experience integration on an equal level with men. The care of children does not affect the career of women scientists to a great extent because few of the women with children show a drop in their publication performance after child birth. There is a tendency, however, to emphasize a heavy work load associated with the combination of child care and work and the implica- tions are less time and energy for scientific work. The data indicate that women scientists are as motivated as their male colleagues. Male scientists, however, seem to be more ambitious in their attempt to receive high positions. A preliminary conclusion is that the careers of female scientists reflect subtle forms of discrimination as well as preference for devoting time to the care of children. "What Does Knowledge with a High Degree of Flexibility Look Like?" Jean-Marie Trouv?-La Rondelle How can one account for the progress of technological knowledge? It has been argued (Pinch and Bijker) that models of scientific knowledge can be applied to technological knowledge on the grounds that accounting for more people, more groups, greater heterogeneity, or greater pluridisciplinarity is a matter of degree. The work presented here demonstrates that, in order to describe the development of technological knowledge, the task of introducing greater flexibility is more than "a matter of degree." It leads to a different approach to specialized knowledge</page><page sequence="106">188 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values that shows that current models of scientific knowledge underestimate the degree of flexibility and overestimate the degree of consensus. The structure, growth, and evolution of scientific knowledge are shown to emerge from a graphic representation as a function of flexibility. The model was developed from the tentative to solve the problem: How do scientists, and analysts of scien- tific knowledge, reach research fronts? This is why, whereas the research front is the point of departure of current studies of scientific knowledge, it is here considered as the point of arrival. Access to the research front, which involves the knowledge learning phenomenon, is tackled at the micro problem level where the structure and the growth of knowledge are defined. The next step consists of integrating all the problems of which science is composed. A reproduction mechanism is introduced accordingly so that any prob- lem, and the associated knowledge structure, is shown to emerge from another. The successive reproductions of the structure define the evolution of knowledge. The resulting tree of evolution does not diverge. In other words, no matter how high the degree of atomization of knowledge is at the micro problem level, this trend is not observed at the aggregate level of evolution. "Truth and Decision." Stephen P. Turner- University of South Florida Scientific belief is ordinarily regarded as a distinctive kind of belief, not subject to the kinds of uncertainty and considerations of the convenience of improving one's belief to which decision making is typically subject. This turns out to be a misleading dichotomy: Some decisions are made in the face of well-structured problems and are as "certain" as any belief of science; some scientific beliefs involve ill-structured problems in which decision in the face of uncertainty plays a large role. "Deci- sions" subject to a great deal of uncertainty shape the way in which scientific belief develops. So the realm of decision and that of science interpenetrate. The fact that science can contribute to political decision making does not always mean that these decisions become much more clear. Policy decisions in which science plays a role are typically complex, ill-structured problems, in which there are some well- structured elements. The disputes are often intractable because participants in the disputes with different competencies see the larger problem in terms of the well- structured parts of their own "solution," and consequently define the problem dif- ferently and weigh the issues of uncertainty and convenience differently. "Determining Information Needs for the Peer Review Process." W. A. Turner-Advanced Information Products Research Department, Institut pour l'Information Scientifique et Technique/CNRS---and Francoise Laville- SERPIA/INIST</page><page sequence="107">Abstracts 189 A decision has recently been taken in France to create an Institute for Scientific and Technical Information. The CNRS is responsible for the project: Its goal is to increase France's share of the world's information market. This goal suggests, among other things, the need for research into ways of anticipating user needs for new information products. The methodological problem with user need studies is that often results are predetermined by the existing configuration of products, technologies, markets, and prices. One solution to this problem is to study the way in which information is integrated into ongoing activities, instead of asking people what information they need. The use they make of information in a particular context is observed and ana- lyzed. New data processing techniques are then designed to "package" informa- tion for easy use in the defined context. In our paper, we will report on work under way to study how information is incorporated into the science policy decision-making process. We will first look at various attempts to modelize the decision-making process before arguing that perhaps a more fruitful line of research lies in empirically determining science policy options. We will then describe a method based on co-word analysis that seems to be appropriate for this type of empirical study. Co-word policy option maps are used to input information into the peer review process. Sessions with experts have been tape-recorded and the tapes are currently being analyzed in order to deter- mine the use made of outside information in a decision-making context. We will report the description of what seems to be some of the major data processing needs of the peer review process. "The Concept of 'Image' in Medical Innovation." Karin van den Berg, Peter Groenewegen, and Philip Vergragt- Science and Society Unit, Chemistry Laboratory, University of Groningen The introduction of medical technologies, like medical drugs or hormones, is often accompanied by new risks and problems. Sometimes these negative effects only become known after their large-scale introduction. A problem here is that sometimes the results of clinical or biomedical research are not recognized by the clinical users of the drugs. We hypothesize that the reason for this is that the positive "image" of the drug is not consistent with the negative information, and thus the transmission of this information is blocked (Groenewegen et al. 1987). In this paper, we shall outline a research program on three hormones: DES, Duogynon, and Clomid. These cases are about hormone drugs in the gynecology/ obstetrics discipline. The most visible negative side effects are their carcinogenic and teratogenic potentialities. In the research project, the structure of the generated knowledge will be investigated, together with the images of the drugs in the rele- vant social groups. In the paper presented here, we shall show the first results of this project, namely an analysis of the knowledge generated around these hormones. An elaboration will</page><page sequence="108">190 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values be given on the methods to be used to investigate the images of the relevant actors, and to relate those images to their actual behavior vis-a-vis the hormones.

"Did Knowledge Structures in the Study of Philosophy at Dutch Univer- sities Change under Economic and Political Pressures?" Barend Van der Meulen, Annelie Roozen, and Loet Leydesdorff-Department of Science Dynamics, University of Amsterdam In this study, we investigate whether the drastic changes in economic and political climate for the study of philosophy at the Dutch universities had effects on what philosophers study. During the last five years, the Faculties of Philosophy went through a period of transition. First, in 1982, the Dutch government introduced the system of Con- ditional Finance for research at the universities. As in most humanities, however, philosophers are accustomed to working individually, and the demand that programs can be funded only if several people take part did not match philosophers' work organization. In 1983, a drastic reduction in the budget for philosophy was pro- posed in the framework of a policy of introducing savings by distributing tasks among the universities. The resistance of the philosophers has been strong: Eventually, the minister had to withdraw the concentration plan, and to accept an alternative that was developed by a committee of the Royal Academy. Budget cuts were maintained, however, and new policy initiatives announced. We have systematically compared publications by the Dutch philosophers from the 1979 to 1980 period-at the top of a period of sustained growth-with those from 1984 and 1985-after a few years of crisis and reorganization-on such aspects as the topical area, the authors referred to in these publications (either as a citation, a quote, or a reference), the language of publication, and so on. These results were then also compared to changes in the international environment: a first orientation at the international level was made by studying the position of philosophy journals in the JCR of the SSCI. The results of this comparison will teach us about whether the sometimes implicit policy objective of internationalization has been met. In ad- dition to presenting empirical results, some methodological questions concerning the application of scientometric methods to a field of the humanities will be raised.</page><page sequence="109">Abstracts 191 "A Citation Gap." W. P. van Els, C.N.M. Becker Jansz, and C. le Pair- Technology Foundation, STW Citation counting is a well-known and reputedly useful instrument for measur- ing the quality of scientific research. It should not be used indiscriminately, however. One restriction is encountered when we compare research in different disciplines. Differences in publication and citation traditions may lead to incorrect results. A particularly severe case confronts us when we use citation counts in the comparison of applied with more fundamental research. In the Science Citation Index, we find far more citations of fundamental papers than of applied work, especially where the latter leads to the development of instruments. This seems to indicate that the impact of fundamental research is much greater. We hold that the relevance of applied research is greatly underestimated com- pared to that of fundamental research, especially when we rely on citation counts only. This position is confirmed and strengthened with quantitative data in the case of the electron microscope. Given that this instrument is used predominantly for further research, it is particularly suitable. The instrument itself can be considered equivalent to a publication. Just as a written article, an instrument is a means to communicate the results of research. Accordingly, a reference made to it in a publica- tion should be considered as a citation. Not counting and including such citations in the Science Citation Index, one creates a "citation gap." Starting from a data base consisting of the names of the institutes using a par- ticular kind of electron microscope and lists of publications provided by a sample of c. 150 of those institutes: -we estimate the total number of publications of research in which an electron microscope is used; -we report the ways in which this usage is reflected in publications; and -we estimate the size of the citation gap. "Stimulation of 'Hot' Technologies, Industry and Research: Technical Ceramics in the Netherlands." Gerard van Pijkeren and Peter Groenewegen-Science and Society Unit, Chemistry Laboratory, Univer- sity of Groningen Stimulation of technological and scientific research to stimulate economic growth has been organized in the Netherlands in the form of IOPs. These are an attempt to keep up with international developments. Technical ceramics is one of the areas that is stimulated in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, technical ceramics does not have a solid industrial basis; also, research in this field started only recently. The official aim is to create local scientific and technical capability to produce technical ceramics.</page><page sequence="110">192 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values The paper shows how, in a scientific and industrial vacuum, different groups struggle about the definition of the role and place of research. The obligations of two ministries, those of Economic Affairs and Education and Science, toward research in the area have been combined in one program; and one research institute was selected as the center for ceramic research. Industries that have been involved in the formulation of the IOP and that should have benefited from the development can be divided in two groups, small local firms and firms with international connections. The network of users of the technological and scientific advice of research institutes consisted mainly of internationally oriented firms, leaving out the local firms. The transfer of knowledge from the research institutes to the internationally oriented industry was of minor importance to their own technological and economic performance. The analysis showed that research institutes developed a knowledge-oriented net- work around themselves consisting of other research institutes and dealing with local branches of internationally oriented industrial customers. The industries that are most important in the field of ceramics had their own network, which involved sup- pliers, customers, and research groups. Such networks are basically international in organization. The particular case can be used as stepping stone to discuss na- tional stimulation of research and technology and the selection processes involved in it. "Imaging Science: A Formal Model." A.F.J. van Raan- Science Studies Unit, LISBON-Institute, University of Leiden Although science in its very heart mainly culminates in the thinking of one creative person, structurally, on a somewhat larger distance, it can be described as a hierar- chy of networks of interrelated items. These items can be, in principle, all imaginable types of "information" or "knowledge" containing entities. In the first, and most "basic network," these entities are, for example, colleague scientists in the direct, daily interaction. Then, "on a larger distance," other networks are visible. The work of the in- dividual scientists appears to be part of a second-order network. In contrast to the basic network (the "real world"), we perceive this second-order network as the show-window world of science. Often, the items in this network are scientific publica- tions or, more precisely, specific data such as references, words, field classifica- tions, and types of publication. The second-order network is essentially a system of interrelations between these items in various modalities. We describe the transformation of the real world (basic network) into a show- window world (second-order network) as an imaging process, on the analogy of optical image formation. This formal model appears to have useful features that enable us to understand more systematically the pictures (images) given in the show- window world in relation to the original objects of the real world. In particular,</page><page sequence="111">Abstracts 193 filtering and deformation are important properties of the imaging process. It is in- teresting to attribute to these properties a cognitive sense, because the model of imaging in fact represents a cognitive process. It will be demonstrated that the im- aging model provides a valuable framework to understand strengths and weakness of images like co-citation and co-word structures, and the relations between them. "The External Organization of Universities: Cases of Personal Unions in the Netherlands." Frans van Steijn-Department of Science Dynamics, University of Amsterdam University research groups not only organize their work within the framework of an international community, but they also develop an active strategy toward a local environment. In the Netherlands, a particular group of university researchers can be identified as members both of the scientific community and of such a local environment: these are the part-time professors; approximately 12% of all Dutch professors occupy a major function outside the university system. My hypothesis has been that the apparent need to appoint part-time professors is a consequence of the fact that research groups maintain an external organization that is as vital to their work as their relation to the academic world is. A survey among all part-time professors allowed for two main conclusions. The first is that, primarily, the university research group benefits from the special rela- tion with the practical environment. The second conclusion is that research groups, through their part-time professor, establish a relation with a very specific category of practical environments. Three case studies were designed to specify these conclusions in greater detail in the fields of business economics, chemical technology, and immunology. In these cases, it could be sharply defined what the practice contributes to the scientific field. Actually, these practices are in fact not environmental to the research, but they are-in different degrees-substantially integrated in parts of the work that is carried out by the group. It can be said that a research group needs an external organization both with a theoretical (international) world and with a practical (local) world. A practical world may consist of an audience system (for example, national politics for macro-economists), a practice (for example, in medical fields), an application or a technology (for example, in chemical technology), or the system that is subject to the research (for example, corporate management is a subject for business economists). In the external organization of university groups, the analysis of the part-time professorate gave us a better understanding of the mechanisms involved. "Characteristics of the Science and Technology Interface Studied by Pa- tent Analysis." B. G. van Vianen, H. F. Moed, and A.F.J. van Raan- Science Studies Unit, LISBON-Institute University of Leiden</page><page sequence="112">194 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values Recent developments in technology are often based on scientific progress. In- vestment in research and development and cooperation with basic research institu- tions, therefore, become increasingly important factors in the ability of industries to keep pace with rapid technological advance. In this study, we explore possi- bilities to identify characteristics of the "science base" of technological developments by analyzing references (citations) in U.S. patents to scientific literature. Patent data carry important information on the science and technology interface, because patent references to scientific publications can be seen as linkages between science and technology. Two data sets were studied: all 1985 U.S. patents (worldwide invented) in chemical technology and pharmaceutics; and all Netherlands-invented U.S. patents for all technology fields (1982-1985). The examiner-given references to scientific literature were analyzed. The construction of a "science intensity index" for small- and medium-sized countries is hampered by serious reliability problems. A thorough discussion of methods and techniques along with a discussion of data collection and data manipulation are a prerequisite for a reliable science intensity assessment. The age distribution of patent references to scientific literature was studied for chemical technology and for two subfields. The type of journal (basic, applied) to which the patents refer was analyzed, yielding an indication of the trajectory length between science and its applications in technology. We analyzed the age of references to the ten most highly cited journals to assess the journals' role in the transfer of knowledge ("rapid": new findings versus "mature": basic methodology, theory). Results will be presented at the conference. "New Technological Developments and Technology Assessment: Argu- ment for an Integrated Approach." Philip Vergragt and Peter Groenewegen-Science and Society Unit, Chemistry Laboratory, Univer- sity of Groningen The study of the creation of new technologies has received considerable atten- tion during the last few years. These processes have been described and analyzed in terms of construction or shaping of new technologies, translation, emerging net- works, reverse salients, and so on. Also, there has been renewed attention to technology assessment, the evaluation of possible future adverse affects of new technologies. Technology assessment has recently been conceptualized as the crea- tion of policy alternatives by social actors concerning the potentialities of new technologies. Studies of the creation of new technologies and of the assessment of such technologies are separated to a large extent. We will use new engineering materials, as an example, to illustrate the possibilities for an integrated approach. New engineering materials (polymer composites, technical ceramics, new metal alloys) are increasingly substituted for more traditional materials. Substitution takes place primarily in high-tech industries (airplanes, airplane engines), consumer prod-</page><page sequence="113">Abstracts 195 ucts (cars, sports equipment), and domestic equipment. New materials are in part the result of combining metals with polymers, polymers with glass, polymer or boron fibers, metals with carbon or aramide fibers, and so on. Resultant problems are difficult to assess, partly as a consequence of disparity between the industrial organiza- tion that forms the context of innovation, internal (to industry) preventive measures, and public policy that concentrates on countering adversity, primarily on regula- tion and control after the introduction. The paper demonstrates that it is, as a consequence of this disparity between public regulation and industrial innovation decisions, difficult to find common ground between studies of environmental, waste, and recycling aspects (the TA side) and studies of the creation process of new materials. Notwithstanding the difficulties, initial results show promising possibilities for generating information that can be used to enhance feedback on adverse effects in the process of the creation of new technologies. This information is of relevance to policymaking in both the stimula- tion of new technologies and the assessment of possible adverse consequences. "Sociology of Science and Normative Ethics." Henk Verhoog- Institute of Theoretical Biology, University of Leiden In this paper, a proposal will be formulated for the inclusion of normative/ethical analysis in the methodology of science and technology studies. This means a radical departure of the still-dominating empiricist approach, according to which the social scientist is an engineer, a handmaiden to decision making, whose only task is to deliver the best means for achieving ends that are determined by policymakers. The relativistic turn in the sociology of science has questioned positivistic/empiricist views upon rationality in science, but left the implicit or explicit belief in the irra- tionality of normative statements untouched. Sociologists tend to make the rationality of knowledge and behavior dependent on the social context, thereby denying the possibility or need of norms and values that, to some extent, transcend this context. The tendency toward universalization in ethics is criticized as "moralization." A result of this approach is that it becomes very difficult to find any more general normative standards that could be used to criticize the existing social order. Such criticism, if it is formulated at all by scientists, can then only be seen as subjective preferences, finding their outlet in strategic political actions. There is little room left for the idea of the moral responsibility of individuals, with the individual hav- ing to account for his or her behavior on moral grounds, that is, in terms of good justifying reasons, especially if this behavior departs from well-established prin- ciples or if it has consequences that may affect other beings in a negative way. The "good-reasons approach" in ethics, steering between absolutism and relativism, is a fruitful approach for scientists in dealing with the ethical aspects of their work in democratic societies. It means an alternative to both scientism (elitism) and what is erroneously called neutralism, keeping alive the tradition of the critical intellec- tual, which is much needed in the world today.</page><page sequence="114">196 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values "Medical Practice as a Topic in the Study of Science and Technology: The History of the Coronary Vasodilator Concept in Anglo-Saxon and Ger- man Medicine." Rein Vos- Department of Pharmacology and Phar- macotherapeutics, Section Pharmacy &amp; Society, State University of Groningen Therapeutic change testifies to the complex relationship between science, technology, and practice. Prevailing models of therapeutics, however, map out the triad science, technology, and practice in such a way that medical practice is con- sidered as terminal station of therapeutic change. In this paper, it is argued that medical practice is integrally involved in therapeutic change. This issue was taken up through an analysis of the evolution of the coronary vasodilator concept in two different medical settings: Anglo-Saxon and German medicine. This concept embodied the principles that governed clinical interventionist strategies in patients with angina pectoris, a serious cardiovascular disease. The coronary vasodilator concept took a different course and timing in these two medical settings. In the Anglo-Saxon context, the concept broke apart during the late 1950s and early 1960s. In contrast, German medical doctors held to this view until late in the 1960s. This case study shows that German and Anglo-Saxon doctors possessed con- trasting ideas about how to diagnose problems associated with cardiovascular disease, how to distinguish patients at risk from those not at risk, and when and how to treat these problems. These differences are becoming more marked when focusing on the uses of medicines. For the use of medicines as well as of other forms of medical technology reveals the particularity of patients and the complexity of real life that are accounted for and dealt with in the routine of daily practice. Thus understanding medical technology development not only involves which ideas, however much socially constructed, but also which practices are embodied in medical technology. Practice should, therefore, be a major topic in the study of science and technology. "Reasonable Arguments, Reasonable Decisions: The Cambridge Ex- perimentation Review Board and the Rhetoric of Science Policy." Craig Waddell-Department of Language, Literature, and Communication, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute The goal of this paper is to clarify the nature of one model of public participa- tion in technological decision making by examining the role of the Cambridge Ex- perimentation Review Board (CERB) in the seven-month (July 1976-February 1977) moratorium on recombinant DNA (rDNA) research in Cambridge, Massa-</page><page sequence="115">Abstracts 197 chusetts. After reviewing the background of the Cambridge case, the paper focuses on CERB's 23 November 1976 debate, which was the turning point in the commit- tee's proceedings. Three key features of CERB's operating model were that the committee would confine itself to assessing the health risks posed by rDNA research; that it would make rational decisions; and that it would defend those decisions before the com- munity. CERB's performance with respect to these three features-particularly the second-was mixed. CERB members were inevitably influenced by biases and emotions, but the pressure of accountability ensured that decisions did not surface until they were rationally reconstructable. Hence, arguments served a twofold purpose in CERB's decision-making process: in the context of discovery, they helped to form decisions; in the context of justification, they helped to legitimize decisions. In the context of discovery, CERB members were influenced by a variety of appeals, but in the context of justification, they were almost exclusively concerned with appeals to reason. By analyzing the structure of and response to the various arguments presented in the 23 November 1976 debate and by analyzing the rhetorical strategies employed by the participants in this debate, this paper attempts to describe how ethical and emotional appeals apply in a reasonable, though not strictly rational, decision-making process. The paper relies heavily upon archival materials collected by MIT's Oral History Program, and on extensive interviews with the former CERB members and with key scientists who testified before CERB. "Social Sciences and Societal Developments: The Missing Perspective." Peter Wagner and Bjorn Wittrock-Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study in the Social Sciences This article makes an attempt to develop some elements for a conceptually sound approach to analyze the relation between the social sciences and societal developments by critically considering three different research traditions in this field and by discern- ing their respective deficiencies. Rather than dealing with the various disciplinary or subdisciplinary fields, this is done by focusing on three major topics that have been approached from different angles. The idea of "scientification" of politics has a history as old as the one of the social sciences. For a long time, it was debated in general theoretical terms often linked to high expectations concerning the societal impact of such a process; in recent years, following the expansion of social science research in the 1960s, the discussion took a more concrete path, basing itself on the empirical analysis of "knowledge utilization." Such a discussion is obviously related to policy attempts to make the sciences more "utilizable." A brief overview of science policy developments is given and findings of science policy research are discussed under the heading of "politicization" of science. The</page><page sequence="116">198 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values theoretically more ambitious approaches to this topic naturally lead to the question of how scientific findings originate and if their production can be influenced at all. This debate, mainly led by philosophers, historians, and sociologists of science, has in recent years increasingly been shaped by the assertion of some (and the re- jection of others) that science is socially constructed, and it will be under this guiding perspective that this topic is briefly touched upon. Concluding from this research review, it is argued that empirical research on social science developments has to be linked to recent debates in social theory on the need to overcome the dichotomy between mutually exclusive macro- and micro-analytical perspectives. The approach briefly sketched here focuses in particular on efforts to reintroduce theorizing about macro-societal institutions and state formations. "From Studies of Scientific Knowledge to Reflexive Ethnography." Teri Walker- CRICT, Brunel University This paper is based upon an in-depth ethnographic study of the development of software currently being undertaken by the author. The study follows the pro- gress of a particular piece of software from its inception to production. The idea is to look at the relation between produced artifact and producing environment to see what can be learned about how that relation works. This study is intended to both build on, and move on from, social studies in science. The study of science and technology in the future is faced with some fundamen- tal questions about method: How exactly should we be studying an area that social studies of science has already identified as ephemeral and transitory? Taking a case- study approach has produced some of the most interesting work in this field and is very much on the increase. While this movement is-and, after Kuhn, should be-welcomed, it does pose some methodological difficulties. Is it enough to be where the action is, or not, in the hope that an understanding of what science or technology is will emerge? I would suggest that rather more than that is needed if the promise of those salutary studies in SSK looking at the social construction of science and/or knowledge is to be both realized and moved on. A much clearer methodological statement about the theoretical and conceptual framework under which such studies are undertaken is now timely and necessary. This is not to suggest that there is a safe or fail-proof method that can be program- matically adopted; rather it is to suggest that bringing the observer into the picture requires more than a reflexive turn, as has been suggested. A congruence between mind and method is required that manages to be explicit without being intrusive; as is a form of writing that will do that and encapture or enframe the particular study. The paper concludes with some suggestions for how a reflexive ethnography might accomplish just that.</page><page sequence="117">Abstracts 199 "An Examination of the Impact of Nineteenth Century Social Science in Establishing Negative Values and Attitudes towards Indigenous Agricul- tural Knowledge Systems." Dennis M. Warren-Technology and Social Change Program, Iowa State University-Jan Slikkerveer-University of Leiden-and Peter Geschiere-Institute for Cultural and Social Studies, University of Leiden Although there has been a growing concern for Third World small-scale farmers by agricultural research and extension professionals in the past decade, this interest reflects a dramatic change in values and attitudes by agricultural scientists. A key factor militating against interest in the small-scale, non-Western farmers can be traced to negative Euro-American values and attitudes about non-Western peoples and their indigenous knowledge systems. These attitudes were generated in part by nineteenth- century social scientists who delineated humankind along a unilineal evolutionary ladder based on Social Darwinism. Any people outside the mainstream of progressive European culture were formally regarded to be less than civilized human beings. In some of the social models, evolutionary stages were defined according to racial criteria. Black populations were identified as the lowest stage of human development- -labeled the "savage" or "primitive" stage. An intermediate stage of development- -sometimes labeled "barbaric"-was represented by the so-called brown, red, and yellow peoples of the world. The highest stage of development-termed "civiliz- ed"-was represented by the white populations. "Savages" were posited to have primitive minds with intellectual endowments equivalent to that of European children. They were characterized as lacking sophisticated agricultural concepts and vocabularies. It was believed that such populations could be assisted in their evolu- tionary movement toward civilized status through formal education based on Euro- pean models. Like all "savages," the farmers of non-Western countries were looked upon as having much to learn from Westerners-but certainly having nothing of value to offer the West. The European-oriented educational system inherited at in- dependence virtually ignored indigenous agricultural knowledge systems. "The Sponsorship of Technology." Ron Westrum- Departments of Sociology and Interdisciplinary Technology, Eastern Michigan University This paper directs attention to the issue of the sponsorship of inventions and inventors. The "Social Construction of Technology" framework emphasizes that technology is affected by a social network of designers, makers, users, and evaluators. Here we consider the issue of differential power in such networks. Influential ac- tors ("sponsors") and examples of their influence are examined. Issues such as public versus private sponsorship, information control, and accountability are briefly discussed.</page><page sequence="118">200 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values "Informing the Public on Uncertain Risks." Rob Weterings and Jose van Eijndhoven-Department of Science, Technology and Society, Univer- sity of Utrecht Soil pollution and industrial activities near residential areas confront the residents with health risks. We analyzed the information on health risks communicated by the authorities to local residents and the underlying risk assessments in Dutch cases of soil pollution. It is common practice to use the conclusions of risk assessment in communicating information on the risks involved. It is questionable, however, whether risk assessments generate risk information suited for communication purposes. In the cases studied, the authorities communicate risk information to residents in quantitative terms by comparing concentrations of pollutants that were found with the official standards. In doing this, conclusions of risk assessments are summar- ized, sometimes by quoting verbatim the conclusions of the underlying scientific reports. Public relation officers hardly explain the scientific information because, as they say, scientific uncertainty makes it impossible to put conclusions of risk assessments into simple and still correct terms. In none of the cases we studied was the existence of scientific uncertainty mentioned in the official risk information, nor did any of the risk assessments elaborate on it. The media, however, clearly gave evidence of the existence of scientific uncertainty by reflecting the conflicting but categorical interpretations presented by all parties involved. This variety of in- terpretations confuses local residents, which sometimes results in their resignation to the presence of a potential health risk. In risk communication, effects of confusion and resignation should be anticipated. One way to optimize risk communication is to optimize the content of the informa- tion on health risks. The paper argues that the scientific uncertainty inherent in risk assessment, allowing for a variety of seemingly conflicting interpretations, should be elaborated on-for instance, in both a worst case and a best case scenario-in order to generate risk information that can be used to make scientific uncertainty manageable in risk communication. "The Social World of Independent Inventors." Peter Whalley--Loyola University of Chicago The history of modern innovation is primarily that of the industrial research laboratory, but the demise of the independent inventor-like that of the small business-has been much exaggerated. Drawing on research in progress among the 2000 practicing independent inventors belonging to the Chicago Inventors' Coun- cil, the paper begins to explore the social practices of inventing and the inventor's involvement in a collective network. This includes the audience--patent office, fund- ing sources, manufacturers, and the like-which evaluates work, establishes reputa-</page><page sequence="119">Abstracts 201 tions, and provides financial support; and the various support groups that provide the material conditions of existence for technical invention-the libraries, patent attorneys, model builders, and prototype shops. Particularly important, in the absence of the organizational resources of the research lab or university, is the social and material support provided by spouses, family, and friends. The paper also tentatively explores the distinctive discourses and normative ex- pectations of the various parties. Inventors, for example, like to focus on the "originality" or "innovative nature" of their product. The manufacturer or ven- ture capitalist, on the other hand, needs to be convinced of its "marketing poten- tial." Both are discursively constructed against a background of conventions, each distinctive to their respective social worlds, which need to be negotiated to establish the necessary working relationships. Finally, the beginnings of a typology of independent inventors is developed based on extent of involvement in inventing, type of technology, level of technical train- ing, and so on. It focuses particularly on the various routes into independent inven- ting by examining inventors' backgrounds, education, and training, looking at both sources of inventing creativity and the social structures necessary to transform poten- tial into practice. "The Recognition of Risks Posed by Technology." Caroline Whitbeck- Massachusetts Institute of Technology Philosophers debate whether risk is an objective category or a social construc- tion, with some arguing for a middle position. I argue that risk is similar to the notion of an illness in that some risks present threats to any human community and, therefore, will be recognized in any cultural setting. A risk of an illness or impair- ment that produces gross physical incapacity will be recognized in every culture although it may be conceptualized in one culture in terms of obstruction of chi, in another as suppression of immune response, and in a third as manifestation of spirit possession. Conceptualizations, ideologies, and the valuation of capacities often vary greatly from one culture to another, so some risks will be difficult or impossi- ble to recognize within a given culture. The risks perceived within a culture may be sorted into (1) those that are easily recognized, (2) those that are recognizable but often overlooked, and (3) those that are unintelligible within the culture. The concern of this paper is with the second category of recognizable but overlooked risks of technology. I argue that, where the risks of a technology inter- fere with what is seen as "women's work," the risks themselves are often ignored. This is well illustrated by the case of the electronic fetal heart monitor (EFM), which has come to be used more or less routinely in obstetrical care in many hospitals in the United States. Only since last year, when a randomized clinical trial was finally conducted and showed that the EFM did not improve outcomes even for high-risk births, has there begun to be widespread attention to the risk of increasing length</page><page sequence="120">202 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values of labor associated with the EFM because it restricts the motion of the birthing woman. Other technologies to be discussed include x-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging for fetal imaging. "The Development of a Research Project in a Third World Country." Ange Wieberdink-Department of Science Dynamics, Amsterdam This paper will analyze the relation between a research project in a Third World country and its social context. Special attention will be paid to the role of client relationships. The object of the study is a policy-oriented research project concerned with the "National Plan of the Recuperation of the Contaminated Lake Managua" in Nicaragua. The project, titled "Limnology Applied to Lake Managua," is a three- year cooperative effort between the Water-Research Center (CIRA) of the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua (UNAN) and the Department of Aquatic Ecology of the University of Amsterdam, which started in October 1985. The three objectives of this project are -to develop a biological-based method of integral management of tropical lakes, -to supply Nicaragua with an infrastructure for limnological research that may serve as a future base for policy-oriented research directed to problems of water- contamination, and -to develop a policy to improve Lake Managua by supplying information for suitable management measures. Examining the discussions preceding the formulation of this project, it is useful to focus on the translation of sociopolitical problems into scientific terms. This facilitates the analysis of the establishment of client-relationships. The author of this paper takes part in the supervision of the project and is respon- sible for the yearly internal evaluation. Based on the information collected through this participation and from the progress reports, the development of the research in the first two years will be reconstructed. Interviews with the persons directly involved will be used to complete this reconstruction and to gain a better understand- ing of the development of client relationships. "Cultural Beliefs about Gender and Scientific Development." M.A.v.d. Wijngaard-Women's Studies in Biology, University of Amsterdam Until now, sociology of science did not consider how cultural beliefs about masculinity and femininity in science affect scientific development. One of the biomedical fields in which concepts of masculinity and femininity are in use is research in brain differentiation caused by gonadal hormones before birth (neuro-</page><page sequence="121">Abstracts 203 endocrinology). In this case study, the development of the field is studied during the years 1959 to 1980. In 1959, a group of researchers working on hormonal effects in behavior postulated the organizational hypothesis on brain differentiation. This hypothesis suggested that androgens administered prenatally have an "organizing" or "masculinizing" action on the differentiating brain. The tissues in the brain mediating mating behavior become permanently masculinized by the presence of androgens before birth, resulting in masculine mating behavior. In animals where no androgens are circulating, feminine behavior develops. This hypothesis was proposed as be- ing promising for adjacent fields of neuroendocrinology: neurology, psychology, and embryology. In the 1960s, judging from the articles that were published on the effect of hormones on brain development, the hypothesis was very successful. Research was directed on extension of the theory to other animals (e.g., monkeys) and humans, notwithstanding contradictory results and methodological problems. It will be argued that one of the factors in the acceptance of the organizational theory on brain differentiation is the seamless fitting of the conceptualization of masculinity and femininity in the theory into the cultural beliefs about women and men in the 1950s and 1960s. This argument can be strengthened by comparison with another hypothesis within the same field that did not fit; this hypothesis took years to be accepted in neuroendocrinology. "The Turn to Technology in Social Studies of Science." Steve Woolgar- Centre for Research in Innovation Culture and Technology, Bruenl, University of West London For science watchers of all kinds, an especially interesting event occurs when an established theoretical perspective declares an interest in a new object, because it is then that certain key features of analytic practice become highly visible-either in programmatic claims or in the efforts to "apply" the existing perspective to a new domain of phenomena. This paper examines recent moves to the study of a "new domain"-technology-by proponents of an established theoretical perspec- tive-the social studies of science. In particular, the paper surveys some recent relativist-constructivist approaches to the study of technology. Will the social study of technology make the same mistakes as the relativist sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK)? The paper begins by briefly reviewing the essential features of relativist- constructivist analysis in order to assess the extent of progress in SSK and to ask (whether and) how SSK envisages the circumstances of its own demise. The key strategic significance of SSK is that science represents the "hardest possible case" of cultural production (Collins). So does the turn to technology diminish the cutting edge of SSK? (Which objectivist philosophers will be upset by a social study of technology?) The paper suggests that "hardness" must be recognized as the local</page><page sequence="122">204 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values accomplishment of analytic distance between analyst and object; and that Self con- stitutes a far harder case than science. This means that it is possible to study technology without diminishing the theoretical significance (and radical potential) of the relativist-constructivist perspective, provided that Self is also a central topic of analysis. The paper introduces the concept of technology as text as an important way of addressing these concerns. By way of a survey of recent programmatic claims for a social study of technology, the concept of technology as text is used to identify important analytic ambivalences in the effort to apply "relativism" and "social shap- ing" perspectives to technology. Finally, with reference to a range of epistemological issues and substantive technological domains, the paper outlines some of the ad- vantages of construing technology as text. "Strategy and Control in Organized Research Programs." Sjerp Zeldenrust-Department of Science Dynamics, University of Amsterdam The basic unit of organization of modem natural science and engineering research is the research group; in academic settings, this usually concerns part or the whole of a department. The organized nature of research involves technical and strategic interdependence between the various projects, or lines of inquiry, that constitute a group's research program, and, in relation to that, collective ways of dealing with the group's organizational environment. In this paper, research will be reported on how the development of a research process interacts, in intended and unintended ways, with the enactment or construction of the organizational environment, in a comparative analysis of a series of univer- sity research groups in polymer science and engineering. The basic question in- volved is to come to grips with "external influences on research." Choices involv- ing research problems (that is, short-term research goals) are particularly accessi- ble to empirical investigation. The paper reports on a careful reconstruction of research histories (the develop- ment of the set of research problems) of the investigated groups over periods of 10 to 20 years (often the entire history of a particular group) in an interaction with the organizational environment (demand, audiences, providers of resources). The actual choice process, the way in which research problems, resources, and demand "find" each other in viable choices, may be conceptualized in terms of a nonrational "garbage can model": Research choice comes about in a partly random process that cannot be controlled in detail. This paper deals with ways in which organized research groups nevertheless control, or attempt to control, certain parameters of the research process, which, in a way, makes some choices more likely than others.</page><page sequence="123">Abstracts 205 "Trends and Hierarchies in Relations Between Scientific Specialties: The Case of Polymer Science and Engineering." Sjerp Zeldenrust- Department of Science Dynamics, University of Amsterdam Recently, aggregate journal-journal citation analysis has acquired new interest in a series of studies, as a way of determining (sub)disciplinary structures in science. In this paper, research is presented in which that methodology is employed to study trends and relations within the field of polymer science and engineering, and be- tween this field and neighboring disciplines and specialties. It will be shown that through using only citation data referring to the most re- cent volumes of journals, rather than to all volumes, newly emerging specialty pat- terns can be much earlier identified. Apparently, citations to "classics" obscure more recent changes in the latter approach. Subsequently, flows of citations within polymer science, and between polymer science and various disciplines and specialties, were investigated. As might be ex- pected, relations between core disciplines and more "peripheral" specialties are generally asymmetrical, especially when total flows of citations (all volumes of cited journals) are concerned: This points at a strong cognitive "hierarchy" between, for instance, organic chemistry and polymer chemistry. Upon a closer look, however, phenomena are discerned that strongly deviate from this image of hierarchy and subordination. First, the image already changes, often drastically, when most recent rather than total flows of citations are considered. The large flows of citations are from a specialty to a core discipline. When most recent citations only (last three years) are considered, relations between core field and specialty field are often on a much more equal basis. This supports recent doubts in the existence of cognitive hierarchies in science with very simple data. Second, during recent years, flows of citations from some satellite specialties to core chemistry have increased dramatically. This suggests major changes in the cognitive organization of the discipline, and calls for further research. "Policy for Science in a Steady State." John Ziman and Peter Healey- Science Policy Support Group, London During the past decade, British science has come under extreme pressure from contrary forces. Research is becoming ever more costly and complicated but is of- fering widening horizons for practical exploitation. And yet it is expected to serve the nation's needs ever more directly within a roughly constant envelope of resources. The traditional "academic" research system cannot sustain these pressures and is being radically restructured.</page><page sequence="124">206 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values Science is moving into a dynamic "steady state," characterized by explicit con- cern for prioritized objectives, managerial accountability, concentration of resources, international cooperation, evaluation of performance, selective specialization, in- stitutional flexibility, and tangible outputs. These novel features are indicative of the emergence of a completely new system, built on quite different structural principles. But the process of change is being driven opportunistically by uncoordinated bodies with divergent interests, and the new institutional forms are still quite fluid. The primary role of national science policy (and of science policy research) should be to ensure that important positive features of science, such as personal original- ity, respect for established expertise, open critical debate, and so on are adequately protected in the new system.</page></plain_text>
