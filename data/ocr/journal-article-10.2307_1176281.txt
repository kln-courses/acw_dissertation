<plain_text><page sequence="1">Is John Dewey Eternal? ERNEST R. HOUSE Educational Researcher, Vol. 23, No. 1, pp. 15-16. n response to Garrison's (1994) fascinating explication of Dewey's neglected metaphysics, I shall question the characterization of scientific realism, accept two criti- cisms, and comment on Dewey's ontology and relevance. Garrison portrays scientific realism this way: However, to believe in a hierarchy of reality with fixed and eternal "underlying structures" would be, for Dewey, to commit "the philosophic fallacy" of confusing structures, enduring but not eternal essences and identities that are the constructed consequences of controlled inquiry, with transcendent (or supernal) structures that lie in some mysterious realm beneath (or above) events.... Dewey's realism simply will have nothing to do with eternal struc- tures or with structures that are putatively more fundamen- tal (foundational?) than the events that we can at least occasionally experience. The problem is that scientific realism has little to do with fixed, eternal features. There is nothing in scientific realism that claims an eternal, fixed, final character to real entities. Scientific realists claim that the objects of scientific investigation-gravity, frogs, people, societies, stars-are real. They can exist independently of our knowledge of them (human-made entities excepted) and can be known through inquiry, not in advance of inquiry. Nor is there anything necessarily foundational in such a view. There is nothing fixed about entities in the sense of being eternal or final or nonchanging. In fact, they may be local, dynamic, and short-lived. They exist long enough to have causal in- fluence. So if fixed means eternal and nonchanging, the characterization misleads. By contrast, Dewey argues against the older conception of a fixed, final, eternal order. He was influenced strongly by the organicism that pervaded German thought and op- posed the fixed, eternal structures posited by earlier thinkers, just as Darwin challenged the divine order of species. Dialectics, evolution, flux were ideas of the time. Dewey's criticisms do not deal with contemporary scientific entities and processes, which feature endemic change and transformation. Garrison does have a valid criticism of my overly schem- atized diagram which illustrates that experience is not syn- onymous with events, nor events with reality. This diagram may encourage the impression that there is some static realm of reality. This is better: "Events are the conjunctures of structured processes and are always the outcome of com- plex causal configurations at the same and at many different levels.... For the realist, [the world] is a contingent con- catenation of real structures" (Manicas &amp; Secord, 1983, pp. 399, 403). Although some see mysticism lurking in the idea that there are entities we do not experience directly, this no- tion is no more mystical than gravity, which causes things to happen but is not directly perceived. A partly invisible reality is no more mystical than science itself. Dewey's own ontology is one of events, with structures derivative. "For the Deweyan, nature, including human nature, is an event.... For Dewey structure is functional and transitory rather than fixed and final." Viewing events as basic may be reasonable, but why? Why view humans as events? We think of humans as having integrity and coherence, such structure being what makes us human. Nor does envisioning humans as events connect with common sense, a Dewey aspiration. If someone announced that he or she was an event, we would inch away, and if we an- nounced it about ourselves, we could expect stunned silence and medical treatment. An entity possesses certain features that a nonentity does not. In short, it might be a good idea to reify things. For Dewey the "essence" of things emerges from our in- terest in them based on our purposes and preferences. According to Garrison, "Inquiry is something that mortal organisms ... do to transform events into enduring es- sences and identities so that they can make warranted asser- tions that, when acted upon, aid them in maintaining and enhancing their existence." However, if things depend on the mind, then Dewey is not a realist in the sense that things can be mind- independent. It is one thing to say that we investigate ob- jects because we have an interest in them and in pragmatic excitement put them to use. It is quite another to say that things are the way they are because of human preferences. (Dewey's view could be realist in the sense that events, rather than things, might be mind-independent.) Garrison's profound criticism is his denunciation of dualism. In this, he is correct. Dualism characterizes many realist positions. However, Dewey's alternative is not the best available. Dewey has seen the problem but grabbed the wrong end of the stick. He has tried to connect knowledge and reality through a naturalized epistemology, but has pro- duced an anthropomorphic ontology in which things are shaped too much by the mind. A major direction of causa- tion lies the other way round. The world causally shapes our minds so that we understand the world. The mind does not confer naturalness on the world but, rather, the world naturalizes the mind, which is part of it. Since naturalistic constitutive constraints limit interpretations, world and mind are inextricably intertwined, not dualistic (e.g., David- son, 1984). Nonetheless, Garrison has a telling criticism. Finally, there is the question of Dewey's relevance. No ERNEST R. HOUSE is professor, School of Education, University of Colorado, C.B. 249, Boulder, CO 80309. JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1994 15</page><page sequence="2">doubt, Dewey was a brilliant philosopher, and also a man of his time, who responded to the world around him, to his background and training, to the issues of his day. Science is not the same now, nor education, nor democracy. Some of Dewey's ideas are still relevant, but one cannot expect an intact sest of ideas to apply to the world 80 years later. Philosophy relies for its concepts, examples, and arguments on the changing world around it, as well as on historic antecedents. Nothing is eternal. Not philosophy, not Dewey. References Davidson, D.
