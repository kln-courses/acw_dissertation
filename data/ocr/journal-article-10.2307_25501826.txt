<plain_text><page sequence="1">12 3-1 Modernity and Its Fallen Languages: Tanpinar's Hasret, Benjamin's Melancholy NERGIS ERTURK NERGIS ERTURK, assistant professor of comparative literature at Binghamton University, State University of New York, is working on a book manuscript enti tled "Missed Encounters: Modernity and the Crisis of Language," which explores the intersection of language politics and comparative methodology in Turkish and European literary modernism. It is as if we are witnessing the reconstruction of old, ruined streets with bro ken pavements, their opening up into boulevards. On these new streets, old words in nightcaps and bathrobes will not be able to walk without looking laughable. We await the pleasure of watching new ideas stroll back and forth on these modern avenues. ?Ahmet Ha?im, 1928 ("Lisan") Comparative Literature, from Istanbul IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE EMIGRE FOUNDING FATHERS OF THE Dis cipline of comparative literature in the United States began their exiles from Germany in Istanbul: Leo Spitzer lived and worked in the Turkish city from 1933 to 1936, and Erich Auerbach followed him in 1936 and remained through 1947. In retracing this disciplinary history, Edward Said, Aamir Mufti, and Emily Apter, among other eminent critics, have emphasized the German philologists' exile in Istanbul?all of them, in one way or another, revising a common place understanding ofthe discipline as Eurocentric and develop ing critical methods for a new, expanded form, mode, or practice of comparative literature. The first such gesture?certainly the most memorable and now a canonical moment in postcolonial compara tive literary and cultural studies?was made by Said, who observed of Auerbach's Mimesis that in the act of redeeming European litera ture and culture at a time of crisis, the work paradoxically "owe[s] its existence to the very fact of Oriental, non-Occidental exile and homelessness" (8). Mufti, among others, has followed Said in advo cating cultural critique as a practice that incessantly questions fixed notions of belonging to home and nation (252). Most recently, Apter turns from Auerbach to Spitzer in search of a new direction for the ? 2008 BY THE MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA 41</page><page sequence="2">42 Modernity and Its Fallen Languages: Tanpmar's Hasret, Benjamin's Melancholy PMLA discipline, shifting the emphasis from exilic to "transnational humanism" (Translation Zone 44). Her approach perhaps signals an in tensified focus on the philological inheritance of what is presumably always already a given for comparative work: professional multilin gualism. For Apter, it is not Auerbach, "de prived" by Turkish libraries and isolated (as in Said's account) from the disciplinary co ercions of professional research ethics, but Spitzer, learning to read, write, and speak Turkish in a "policy of non-translation," who speaks to a comparative literature "worlded" from its moment of emergence (45, 60).1 Nonetheless, and notwithstanding the enormous value of this work on the discipline, the main focus ofthe general critical conver sation thus produced remains on the activities of European expatriates and their direct influ ence on the literary establishment in Turkey. Modern Turkish language and literature have been and are, in an almost absurdly literal as well as critical-theoretical sense, a kind of absent presence in this project. This is not a matter of critical ignorance or of either casu ally or deliberately ignoring the obvious or the esoteric. For the stranger, deeper way, I want to suggest, in which Turkey is an absent pres ence in comparative literature is this: though modern Turkish literature has been and is still generally studied and taught through the frame of a national canon, what we call na tional language and literature was a problem of comparison in (and for) Istanbul long be fore Spitzer and Auerbach arrived there. Ot toman and Turkish language and literature, in other words, have been dealing literally with the problem of comparability with Europe at least since the middle of the nineteenth cen tury, when the Ottoman Empire was peripher ally integrated into the economic and political sphere of global capitalist modernity?and, unlike colonial modernities, integrated with out direct European colonial rule.2 The republic of Turkey, which emerged from the Ottoman imperial core in 1923, sub sequently radicalized the project of state-led social engineering begun by the late Ottoman state, attempting to replace all Ottoman Islamic social, political, and cultural institu tions with new ones modeled on those ofthe West. Nazim Irem's aphoristic description of this positivistic, rationalistic, revolutionary project?a "late Enlightenment will to moder nity in a Muslim setting" (80)?shows us how prominent analysts of Turkish social history have tended to read it.3 As a professor at the University of Istanbul at the time, Auerbach was plainly, even acutely, aware ofthe "other history" of comparison that a nascent Euro pean "comparative literature" linked itself to during the philologists' periods of Turkish ex ile. His long letter to Walter Benjamin dated 3 January 1937 shows us just how acutely. To Benjamin's wish "to hear more about the ex tremely interesting?and certainly worthy of note?experiences, in which you are now involved" (Letter), Auerbach replies with a despairing and even vitriolic description of Turkish republican cultural reforms in gen eral and the reform of the Turkish language in particular. For him, this undertaking? which included the abolition of the Ottoman Turkish Arabo-Persian alphabet and its re placement with Latin phonetic orthography (1928), as well as the purging (from the 1930s onward) of Arabic and Persian words, for which Turkish neologisms were substituted? rendered the new national language uniquely reflective ofthe dynamics of violent epistemic change. In what we can only describe as a kind of mourning, Auerbach writes, "[N]o one under 25 can any longer understand any sort of religious, literary, or philosophical text more than ten years old and ... the specific properties of the language are rapidly decay ing. ... The result: Nationalism in the super lative with the simultaneous destruction of the historic national character." Auerbach was hardly alone in this con cern. A colleague of his at the University of Istanbul, the novelist, poet, critic, and pro</page><page sequence="3">! 2 3 . i ] Ner8is Erturk 43 fessor of aesthetics Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar (1901-62), was just one of many prominent (if still largely untranslated) Turkish authors and critics ofthe period who approached linguis tic modernization as a problem of compari son with roots in the nineteenth century. As Tanpinar put it succinctly in a 1959 article en titled "TurkEdebiyatinda Cereyanlar" ("Cur rents in Turkish Literature"), "[T]he change of civilizations [from East to West] manifests itself undoubtedly as a real crisis [kriz] in lan guage" (103).4 For this Turkish comparatist, working at the crossroads of a literary history marked by Poe, Goethe, and Mallarme, on the one hand, and by classical Ottoman and modern Turkish poets such as ?eyh Galip, Ah met Hasim, and Yahya Kemal Beyath, on the other, a literature written in a language in cri sis, in literary forms borrowed from the West, suffers from its "belatedness" in comparison with Europe (105-06).5 In Tanpinar's work, the "existential uneasiness," or huzursuzluk, of not being at one with oneself is fundamen tally a problem of comparison, one that re peatedly tempts Tanpinar to solutions in the form of restored origins. From the encyclope dic Ondokuzuncu Asir Turk Edebiyati Tarihi (1942, rev. in 1956; "History of Nineteenth Century Literature"), regarded as an authori tative account of modern Turkish literature, to the five segments of Be? ?ehir (1946; "Five Cities"), on historically significant Ottoman cities, this impulse is thoroughgoing if also thoroughly complex and contradictory. It is illuminating for our disciplinary context to day, as we look to (or for) comparative litera ture in an age of globalization and inevitably to (and for) new founding moments. In this essay, I revisit Istanbul as a discur sive scene of both the old and new compara tive literatures, to supplement them in their "absent" Turkish presence. Like Auerbach and Tanpinar, I approach modern Turkish literature and literary criticism as an archive of a crisis in language. Yet in so doing I want precisely to resist a thinking of comparability mainly or only as a kind of paralyzing con dition of derivation from Europe?a way of thinking variously manifest in the work of both authors and perhaps dangerously latent even in our best efforts to broaden the disci pline of comparatism today. Redefining the crisis of language as a moment in the repre sentational order of modernity, I juxtapose Tanpinar's book-length essay Be? ?ehir with Benjamin's fragment "Uber Sprache uberhaupt und uber die Sprache des Menschen" (1916; "On Language as Such and on the Language of Man"), suggesting that we may compare the two texts, and describe them as linked, in their engagement with that moment of crisis. Each of these writers approaches modernity as a kind of linguistic Fall, questioning the very possibility of memory in a language undergo ing radical transformation. Each writer finally affirms the fallen representational language of modernity, however, and recognizes new pos sibilities in its reenchantment. If for Tanpinar Turkish literature con tinually revisits the question of its uneven relation to the literatures of Europe, then of course neither Turkish literature nor the literatures of Europe can be reduced to that relation or to a kind of (theoretical) victory in that relation's inversion. When Be? ?ehir is recontextualized next to Benjamin's fragment here, the fragment comes to stand not for a Europe of original signatures but for a Europe specifically, deeply, and similarly absorbed by and in the modern crisis of language. But hierarchical and monolithic comparative cat egories such as West/East and Europe/Turkey do not simply disappear in the magical mo ment when we expose them as fictions. Ex plicitly or implicitly claimed victories for the negation of critical illusion tend more than anything else to erase imperial histories, even perversely affirming the epistemic violence of colonial modernity as liberating.6 What I hope to offer here instead is a supplementary vision of literary modernity in which neither Europe nor Turkey stands for the telos ofthe</page><page sequence="4">44 Modernity and Its Fallen Languages: Tanpmar's Hasret, Benjamin's Melancholy PMLA modern; rather, each of these placeholders diffuses into the other in a partial narrative of two simultaneously entwined and dispa rate histories of language in crisis. I also intend to point to and to supple ment an expansive critical literature on Tan pinar in modern Turkish.7 In a recent book entitled KorAyna, Kayip ?ark ("Blind Mirror, Lost Orient"), for example, the critic and es sayist Nurdan Giirbilek has posed a substan tive challenge to the conservative-nationalist appropriation of Tanpinar as an Ottoman traditionalist ("Kurumus Pinar").8 Giirbilek retrieves another Tanpinar instead, one in perpetual mourning for an irrecoverable past, who fails in his traditionalist pursuit of historical continuity. She also suggests a the matic continuity of Tanpinar's figuration of the past with Benjamin's, though she is un willing to take the comparison too far, citing historical and ideological differences (132). I will reformulate the question of memory in Tanpinar in the context of his writings on the linguistic crisis, shifting the emphasis from what to how one remembers in a language undergoing transformation. If the republican language reforms actively sought to produce an amnesiac hegemonic majority, Tanpinar's writings may be understood as a special ar chive in which the contradictions of a ratio nalizing modernity are exposed in unique ways. And if the linguistic crisis, as Tanpinar implies, is an effect of the discursive com mensurability of modern Turkish language and literature with western European repre sentational practices, we may indeed compare his writings about and in the crisis of repre sentational language with Benjamins. Before moving on to read my primary texts, then, I will make a few observations on the historical grounds of this comparability. Missed Encounters United States-based literary criticism today, be it nationally oriented or comparative, is also haunted by the specter of comparison. Indeed, this uneasiness already has a defined discursive and disciplinary history. Benedict Anderson's The Spectre of Comparisons (1998) is, if not the origin ofthe current debates, then a touchstone in them, together with Jonathan Culler and Pheng Cheah's 2003 collection Grounds of Comparison. Moving to address a "transnationalism [that] has purportedly ren dered obsolete the traditionally bounded areas of area studies" (Culler and Cheah, Preface viii), one position in these debates builds on Anderson's argument that proliferation ofthe institutions of capitalism, in particular print technologies, has given us new "quotidian universals that seep ... through and across all print-languages, by no means in a unidirec tional flow" (Anderson 33). For Anderson, this new global logic of serialization, inasmuch as it is integral to the modern political imagina tion, makes questions framed by the tension between originality and derivation more or less irrelevant, substantively dispensing with Europe as the ground of comparison (29). Harry Harootunian and Partha Chatterjee, on the other hand, argue in Grounds that the homogenizing and universalizing tendencies of global capitalist modernity are nowhere as successfully realized as Anderson makes them out to be.9 Elaborating on this objection, mov ing against Anderson's vision of the state of the disciplines, and supporting the "vocation of comparability" (Harootunian and Park), Harootunian proposes a new comparatism grounded in the space-time of the everyday. His approach emphasizes Euro-American modernity and its "outside" as coeval; he fo cuses on the shared minimal unity of the present structured by the commodity form as the turnkey of comparative cultural analysis ("Some Thoughts" 47). A third major moment in the discursive history of spectral compari son is figured in and by Timothy Mitchell's edited collection Questions of Modernity. Bringing together the work of scholars whose expertise is based in different regions of the</page><page sequence="5">i23.i Ner8?s Erturk 45 globe (with emphasis on the Middle East and South Asia), this editorial project is one of an increasing number to emphasize rigorously the heterogeneity from which the universal ism of Western modernity was produced. In such debates, a lesson that emerges even from disagreements is that the hierar chically structured relation between West and East, Europe and Turkey, remains persis tent as what Mitchell terms a "fiction ... of the nondisposable sort" ("Stage" 12). Ander son's abstract time line, along which stages of modernity can be located, is a representa tion immanent to uneven capitalist moder nity (14-15). One can nevertheless challenge these schematic fictions, Mitchell suggests, by asking what they suppress (12). Above all, such an approach means looking closely at the notion of linguistic crisis, which lends it self readily and somewhat complicitly to the subordination of Turkish literary modernity as derivative. In place ofthe apparently de scriptive negation implied by linguistic crisis, in other words, we might imagine a kind of structurality, a set of conditions of possibil ity, for the use of language?conditions that change, when they change, with a violence for which derivation is too literally translative, or reductive, a term. Speaking descriptively, we might choose to read the historical crisis of modern Turkish not as a moment of subor dination and derivation in crisis but as a dis placing economization of language through crisis?through a historical process, that is, beginning in the nineteenth century, with the peripheral incorporation ofthe Ottoman Em pire into uneven global capitalist modernity. To understand the problem this way is to apply and extend Michel Foucault s analysis of modernity as marked by the abstraction of money and language, by pure signifiers (of ex change). For Foucault, as Rosalind C. Morris has observed, modernity in western Europe is linked to the generalization ofthe commodity form (18, 46-48).10 I lack space here to revisit adequately this lengthy and complex exposi tion (either Foucault's own, or Morris's cogent reading of it), but the central point is that just as money, dislocated from the substance once intrinsically marking wealth, now appears an autonomous medium of exchange, words re moved from the material reality whose marks they bore come to function as "designators" of meaning (Foucault, Order 169; Mots 180). The continuous circulation of signs, Foucault reminds us, will always require a point of fix ture, some functionally universal standard of meaning or value in the general system of logic he calls "representation" (67; 81). His analysis shows us how the vision of a network of signs that would be the "neutral," "trans parent" arrangement of things was funda mental to the imagination in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century western Europe (57; 71). It is the consciousness of the modern to know that even?or especially?the universal cannot guarantee absolute mediation, perfect transparency, in representation (208; 221). The "reign" of representation will inevitably be challenged by "the enormous thrust of a freedom, a desire, or a will... in the modern experience" (209; 222). The modern works of Sade, Nietzsche, Mallarme, and Artaud are exemplary for Foucault in that their main goal and focus are to stage this challenge, keeping in play the simultaneous freeing and alien ation of modern man ruled by representation. In Foucault's analysis, the modern reign of representation, along with the modern challenge to it, is best understood not as a moment in which one episteme overwrites another but rather, as Morris observes, as a process by which one episteme "comes to dominate its antecedent." The episteme of representation "survives even after ... [its] transgression" (47). Foucault's emphasis is, in other words, on representation as the rela tion between the signifier and the signified, between appearance and reality. Thus, rep resentation structures modern humanity's knowledge ofthe world (Foucault 363; 375). It is a schema neither ofthe subjective mind nor</page><page sequence="6">46 Modernity and Its Fallen Languages: Tanpmar's Hasret, Benjamin's Melancholy PMLA ofthe unconscious; rather, it is the organizing principle of any subject's knowledge of the world, as mediated (as Foucault later argued) by new technologies of discipline. Epistemic change, accordingly, is neither a continuous evolution nor a radical rupture: it is a violent displacement. And the chronological posteri ority of modernity's "troubled consciousness" is an anterior posteriority, in the sense that it constitutes, and is already anticipated from within by, the reign of representation, which secures itself "with reference to something outside of itself" (Morris 47). It should be plain that Foucault's analysis develops out of the specific history of west ern Europe. To make use of Foucault in the context of my study, then, I must ask first whether such a reign of representation also operates in Ottoman and Turkish modernity. Taking into consideration the particulari ties of the Ottoman and Turkish histories of representation?language standardization, alphabet reform, and mass reproduction?I answer with a conditional yes: we can read the literature of the Ottoman and Turkish nineteenth and twentieth centuries as a spe cial kind of archive manifesting the traces of an economized language. Recaizade Mahmut Ekrem's novel Araba Sevdasi ("1896; "The Car riage Affair"), for instance, is a brilliant early work of Turkish modernity that we can read as staging representation as the fall of divine, poetic language into arbitrary, communica tive exchange.11 And if the Tanpinar of "Turk Edebiyati'nda Cereyanlar" describes the crisis of modern Turkish as a paralyzing condition of derivation, we can read his Be? ?ehir as a late work that reregisters linguistic crisis as a kind of displacement, turning against hierar chical and identitarian comparative reading. I suggest that the idea of linguistic crisis is not merely a modernist theme but a struc tural condition of the modern. Accordingly, we can give it a primarily (though not com pletely) formal definition. A formal definition does not mean that one can simply, horizon tally negate the hierarchy implicit in that idea of crisis; after all, uneven incorporation into a global literary circuit of translation is a constitutive element of Ottoman and Turkish literary modernity. But the irregular conver gence of western European and Ottoman Turkish literatures during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries cannot be understood only through and as that incorporation?in terms, for example, of the circulatory pat terns of dominant European genres (novel, memoir, drama) or literary currents (natu ralism, Romanticism, modernism). There are two further points to be made. As Mitchell argues, we must address ourselves to the radical heterogeneity of modernity ("Stage" 24). The other task is to recognize forms of relation and thus, directly or indirectly, of comparability in the structural possibility of representation and its crisis. To do this is to displace the still-conventional (even in the academy) understanding of modernity as European. The crisis of modernity must now also be understood as engulfing Europe. When we bring together literary works engaged with and in linguistic crisis, how can we describe the relations and nonrelations among different reflections on (of, in) the cri sis of language as a domain of contradiction in capitalist modernity? Again, to juxtapose Tanpinar and Benjamin here is not to posit a direct, unmediated connection between the works of two writers as discursive objects or to conflate one such object with another. Nei ther is it to take refuge in facile incommensu rabilities ofthe sort that reassert the value of narrow disciplinary and national specializa tion. The idea of a missed encounter, which I propose here as a structural accompaniment to the crisis in language, allows us to use the historical particularity of an overdetermined, uneven global relation as a link, without ex aggerating that link by claims for a systematic or otherwise comprehensive literary history (or historiography). Comparison as a missed encounter allows us to recognize connections</page><page sequence="7">i23.i Nergis Erturk 47 produced by a fundamentally uneven and violently abstracting global modernity; at the same time, it prevents us from conflating or effacing historical differences?between the developments and effects of the Turk ish language reforms, for example, and the developments and effects of technologies of reproducibility in Europe?in singular gene alogies ofthe modern. Hasret and Melancholy In his foreword to the second edition of Be? ?ehir, dated 25 September 1960, Tanpinar brings the "problem" of duality and com parison to the forefront. He states that his impulse in this work is toward reconciliation with the Seljuk-Ottoman past for a resolution of the crisis of modern Turkish identity at an individual as well as a social level (iv). He writes as, in his own words, "a man of heart" rather than as an "engineer" and as a person committed to letting "the second time" ofthe past speak (vi). "There is another time right next to the one in which we live, laugh, enjoy ourselves, work, and make love," he writes, "a time much different, a lot deeper, one that has no relation to the calendar and the clock" ([1946] 80). Be? ?ehir records the visitations of this different and deeper dimension of time, which is marked by historical displacement and fluctuation, appearing and disappearing according to its own logic and occasion. In Ankara, the first of the five cities of the title, the renowned seventeenth-century Ottoman travel writer Evliya (^elebi returns to life and joins Tanpinar (or Tanpinar's narrator) on a modern city walk. In Istanbul, the memory of an elderly neighbor from Tanpinar's child hood returns in a tableau vivant (deliriously she chants the names of Istanbul's springs, hoping to cure herself of an ailment). In the Ottoman capital Bursa, Tanpinar remembers the fourteenth-century birth ofthe empire. Occasionally, the writer makes use of mythic modes common to German Romanti cism, drawing from the imperial Ottoman and Seljuk pasts a vision of Turkish history as the evolution of a national spirit.12 In Tanpinar's teleology, which inverts the mythical histori cism of official nationalism, the Seljuk past is comparable with the Gothic period of Eu rope, whereas the Ottoman period is a kind of golden age, the Turkish Renaissance ([I960] v). The focus of Be? ?ehir gradually turns from time and memory to language, from what one remembers to how one remembers it, in a lan guage undergoing immense transformation. In Istanbul, Tanpinar writes, kaybolmus bir dunyayi anyorum. . . . Ben seraptan seraba ko?uyorum. Her ba?ina ko stugum pinarda muammah cehreler bana uzaniyor; bilmedigim, seslerini tanimadigim dudaklar benimle bitmez tukenmez i^aretlerle konu?uyorlar, fakat hie birinin dedigini anla miyorum; ruhum dudaklanndan aynlir aynl maz hie bir seyin degi?medigini goruyorum. Belki onlar da bana ... kar^ilarma ?ikan sert duvarlardan bahsediyorlar; "Biz de senin gibiydik, diyorlar; hie bir suale cevap ala mazsin. Asil olan icindeki hasrettir; onu son durmemeye calis." Ve onun eski bir ocak gibi daima uyanik bulunmasi icin kah Ferahfeza pesrevini... kah Karacaahmed'in servilikle rini karsima cikanyorlar; ?erefabad'in kink mermer havuzlanna benzeyen bir yigin adi, bu hazir kahplan icimdeki hasretle doldura yim diye bana uzatiyorlar. ([1946] 215-16) I am looking for a lost world_I am running from one mirage to another. At every spring I run toward, mysterious faces reach out to me; lips I do not know, voices I do not recog nize speak to me endlessly, in signals I do not understand. When my soul moves away from their lips, I see that nothing has changed. Per haps they are telling me about... their own hardships. "We were like you," they say. "You will not find the answers to your questions. The only real is the longing inside you_" And to stoke this fire of longing, they make me hear the overture of Ferahfeza... or see the cypress groves of Karacaahmed. They give me a pile of names that resemble the broken marble pieces</page><page sequence="8">48 Modernity and Its Fallen Languages: Tanpinar's Hasret, Benjamin's Melancholy PMLA of ?erefabad's pools, ready-made forms that I can fill with the longing inside me.13 On a first reading, the dead past seems anthropomorphized, acquiring a face and the power of speech. Closer inspection reveals that the image exceeds any resemblance to the hu man form. The "faces" are mysterious: their lips are visible as they speak, but their voices are strange, and what they say cannot be un derstood. This performance of failed anthro pomorphization suggests the ambiguity of the past, juxtaposing the past's proximity and natural familiarity with its irreducible distance and difference. The second half of the passage, especially at the interjection of "Perhaps," regis ters a deeper ambiguity. We could describe this drama of failed anthropomorphism as an abuse of language, or catachresis?"perhaps" stand ing for something impossible to determine, a fantastic effect, as Paul de Man puts it, of "the positional power inherent in language" (21). If the passage quoted above shows us in a general way how memory lives in a ghostly language, we should not neglect to examine its textual particularities. We might notice, for example, two emphases, on verbal sound and on the language of proper names. Lips, one of the organs of speech, are the only clearly identifiable features of the faces?a visually expressed aural bias that can be found everywhere in Be? ?ehir, in images of voice and speech privileging verbal sound as the authentic mediator of the past. Nor is it only human forms that possess the power of speech: throughout the work, the inanimate world of objects, of "agac, su, tas" ("tree, wa ter, stone"), speak to Tanpinar's narrator in a marking of fluctuating and occasional time (150). Ofthe elderly neighbor chanting the names of Istanbul's springs, he writes, "Adeta bir kursun peltesi gibi agirlasan dilinin al tinda ve gergin, kuru dudaklarmin arasinda bu kelimeler ezildikce fersiz gozleri canlanir, biitiin yiizune bizim duymadigimiz birseyler dinliyormus gibi bir dikkat gelir[di] ..." ("As these words were pressed between her tight, dry lips and under her tongue, which was as heavy as melted lead, her lusterless eyes would liven and her face would concentrate as if she were listening to things we could not hear ..."; 107). This image suggests that the magical power of proper names is activated only when they are pronounced; the names of the city's springs become waters themselves in the mouth, returning the old woman to life. Indeed, verbalized water sounds, along with the muezzin's call, classical Ottoman music, and the spontaneous speech of inanimate ob jects, recur throughout Be$ ?ehir. Other forms or categories of imagery are clearly subordi nated to this primary orality, as in a remark able scene set in Bursa, where a landscape painting dissolves into the sound ofthe foun tains (fadirvan), through which the other, "different" time ofthe city is heard (102-05). How to understand this privileging of verbal sound? On the one hand, and in tra ditional critical terms, we can see it as con sistent with the generic differentiation of poetry from prose in Tanpinar's criticism?a differentiation that grants special privilege to sound in poetry. Poetry for Tanpinar is a sensual form ofthe sublime, whereas prose is merely description or representation. But, far from an abstract, taxonomic-aesthetic prefer ence, this privileging of speech over writing must be understood in the specific historical and structural context of linguistic modern ization. The Turkish alphabet reform of 1928, which replaced Arabo-Persian writing with Latin orthography, and the language reforms of the 1930s, in which Arabic and Persian words were purged from the language and re placed with Turkish neologisms, are momen tous events that cannot but be reflected in the written language of the period.14 A primary linguistic effect of these historical projects was to rationalize writing, to abstract meaning from the written sign. Such an abstraction of meaning certainly could be said to character ize all language systems, but we must imagine</page><page sequence="9">12 3-1 Nergis Erturk 49 how an abrupt change of alphabet, justified by the need to catch up with the West, produced a violent disjunction between the reformed Turkish sign and signified. As Ahmet Hasim, Tanpinar's contemporary, wrote in 1928, "There is no doubt that the shape of a word has some influence on the essence of the idea that it carries" ("Harf" 314). In the reform era, the civil writing ofthe Turkish republic is pro moted as a pure vehicle of meaning, promis ing a passage through cultural revolution into Western scientific reason. And the taxonomic aesthetic preference for poetic speech is formed along with this new positivism, which Jacques Derrida (in another context) called the "becoming-prose ofthe world" (287). It is precisely at this point, with the ratio nalization and the mechanization of writing, that one mourns the loss of voice and that poetry acquires its special status as bearer of that loss.15 Ahmet Hasim expressed this in the language ofthe uncanny: For the last three days, while I write, I watch curiously the grappling of alien words [of Persian and Arabic origin] with the new let ters on the white page. These words written with letters, the outlets of which were the nose and the throat, cannot find their sounds on the keyboard ofthe new alphabet to make themselves heard. In a sentence, these words sound like the muffled, ugly screams of peo ple who have lost their voices. ("Lisan" 317) Words of Persian and Arabic origin, part of the language for centuries, are now alien, their sounds eliminated from the new pho netic writing. Speaking at a dinner for the First Turkish Language Congress of 1932, Mustafa Kemal Atatiirk described this free ing of the Turkish language from Persian and Arabic as a war of liberation: "We are going to defeat Ottoman. Turkish is going to be a lan guage as free and as independent as the Turk ish nation" (qtd. in Lewis 49). In Tanpinar's work, the muffled sounds of the Ottoman world return as the lost voice ofthe past, and poetry, along with classical Ottoman music, assumes the status of high art. The conjunction of violence and freedom in revolutionary futurism is reregistered in inverted form by another key image in Be? ?e hir, that ofthe broken marble pools ofthe im perial ?erefabad Summer Palace in Istanbul, to which Tanpinar's narrator likens his "pile of names" irretrievably lost by their referents. As the narrator delivers his essays on An kara, Konya, Erzurum, Bursa, and Istanbul, he mimics the elderly neighbor chanting the names of Istanbul's springs, warding off mo dernity and its generalized language with the singular proper name, that most talismanic of words. Yet something in their invocation as proper names signals their loss of that tal ismanic power, in a disenchanted hasret, or longing for the inaccessible, enchanted past. In a 1953 essay, Tanpinar dwelled on the loss ofthe tulip as a canonical poetic symbol: [L]alenin zevkteki yeri kayboldu. O artik hie bir ?eyin sembolu degildir. Ne sair onun renginde sevgilisinin yanaginin rengini ha tirhyor, ne nakkas ^iniye, mermere, yahut parmakhgin iyi dovulmu? madenden dante lasina onun birlik i?aretini, bir "lamelif" in bukiilu?u ile Allah'dan gayn her mevcudun varhgini ortadan kaldiran sessiz belagatini gecirmeye cahsiyor; ne de yazi ustasi, eski lamTann kavsinden onun seffaf fanusunu tu tusturuyor. Lale simdi... arkasindan tanrisi cekilmis herhangi bir sekil gibi sadece bir ci cek olarak mevcuttur. ("Istanbul'un" 115) There is no longer an aesthetic ofthe tulip. The tulip is no longer a symbol. The poet does not associate its color with that ofthe beloved's cheek; nor does the frescoist seek to convey on enameled tiles, marbles, and railings its sign of unity, its silent eloquence [communicated] through the bending of the letter lamelif, which obliterates all existents other than God. Nor does the calligrapher hang its transparent globe from the arc ofthe letter lam. The tulip ... exists now as an arbitrary figure, whose god has withdrawn?merely as a flower.</page><page sequence="10">50 Modernity and Its Fallen Languages: Tanpinar's Hasret, Benjamin's Melancholy PMLA Once the tulip was employed as a symbol of God or likened to the beloved's cheek; in the old Arabo-Persian writing, the tulip s written sign even conformed to the shape of its refer ent. (Later in this essay, Tanpinar compares the cityscape of Ottoman Istanbul to an or nate book page, likening architectural pat terns in urban space to different calligraphic styles.) Here the loss of divine writing is the loss of an enigma, of a magic structured by debt and guaranteed by God. Nothing could convey this point better than the literal meaning ofthe Ottoman word for metaphor, istidre: "borrowing" (Andrews, Introduction 81). Under modernity, this debt economy of poetic language yields to the logic of general equivalence, the tulip returning to its random formal being as the arbitrary representation of a flower. To read this yielding of poetry to general equivalence in modernity as a mo ment of evolution or of crisis provoking or confirming evolution is, as I have argued, to ignore the yielding's structural anticipation in the displacement ofthe conditions of pos sibility for uses of language: an anticipation already written into Tanpinar's view (in On dokuzuncu Asir Turk Edebiyati Tarihi) of Ot toman court poetry as drawn from a toolbox of "hazir madde" ("ready-made materials"; xxxv). In Tanpinar's own work, we can see, these ready-mades?frequently used symbols, such as the gem or the flower?devolve into empty vehicles, failed symbolizations, failed comparisons of the republican present with the imperial past. Their substantive content is now hasret: insatiable longing for the lost enchantment of language. It would be a mistake, however, to read Be? ?ehir as a narrative of hasret as loss. Has ret contains for the narrator a kind of rec onciliation with, as well as alienation from, modernity's logic of general equivalence. As desacralized or dematerialized language, the language of modernity "merely" represents the world; the binary logic of equivalence separates, while linking, the signifier and the signified. The return of the imperial past in Be? ?ehir is possible only in this representa tional language: "muhakkak ki bu eski ?eyleri kendileri i^in sevmiyoruz. ... [i]$imizdeki didi?mede kayip oldugunu sandigimiz bir tarafimizi onlarda anyoruz" ("in essence, we do not like the things ofthe past in them selves. ... [W]e look in them for a part of ourselves that we think is lost in the internal struggle ofthe present" ([1946] 215). What is more, Tanpinar affirms that any unified re construction ofthe past inevitably dissipates. Looking out over the city of Bursa?which, as the first Ottoman imperial capital, bears the most auratic name in Be$ ?ehir?the narrator recounts the dissemination of place, and then the memory of place, in language: Kendi kendime, ovanin ve etraftaki daglarm neresine du?tuklerini hi^ aramadan, Lamii nin me?hur manzumesinde, her yil ki?i kovmak i&lt;;in bahar ordusunu tic koldan yuruttiigu yer lerin adlarim saymaga cah?iyorum: Abihayat Yaylagi, Molla Alani, Saru Alan, Kurt Bilani, Doglu Baba, ?akim Efendi pinan, Kirkpinar, Binyaylak, Karagol, Hizirbey yurdu, Ku? oy nagi.... Hayir, hepsini hatirlayamiyacagim, zaten siralanni da unutmusum. (102) Without searching for their location in the plain or around the mountains, I attempt to recount to myself the names of the places in [the fifteenth-century poet] Lamii's well known verse, places through which the army of spring approaches every year in three arms to expel the winter: Abihayat Yaylagi, Molla Alani, Saru Alan, Kurt Bilani, Doglu Baba, ?akim Efendi pinan, Kirkpinar, Binyaylak, Karagol, Hizirbey yurdu, Ku? oynagi-No, I cannot recall all; I have forgotten their se quence too. In this simultaneous mourning and for getting of the past, we see how difference inevitably haunts. Lapsed modern language is reenchanted, its signs as "enigma contain ers" invoking the ghosts ofthe past (81). The traces of the past are nevertheless too dis</page><page sequence="11">12 3-1 1 Nergis Erturk 51 persed, too plural to be unified under one name. Through the narrator of Be? ?ehir, the modern poet Tanpinar bears witness to the de-Ottomanization of Turkish?returning as a medium, a receptacle for the dead voices of the Ottoman world, whose visitations take the fragmentary form of proper names. The mod ern poet can only relay these signs; unable to decode their messages, he writes in order to echo the murmurs trapped in them. Walter Benjamin's early, underread essay "Uber Sprache uberhaupt und iiber die Sprache des Menschen" (1916; "On Language as Such and on the Language of Man") anticipates, in linguistic terms, the later, more widely circu lated, and ambivalently celebrative analysis of modernity as the decline of "aura" in "Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner technischen Reproduzierbarkeit" ("The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction") as well as in "Uber einige Motive bei Baudelaire" ("On Some Motifs in Baudelaire").16 In what fol lows, I trace this earlier anticipation, reading Benjamin and Tanpinar through each other and framing Tanpinar's hasret in a missed en counter with Benjamin's topos of melancholy. Though Benjamin's theory of language changes across his body of work, one constant is his resistance to any notion of language as instrumental?as merely a means to the end of communicating truth.17 In "Uber Sprache," Benjamin rejects such communicative instru mentalism as a "biirgerliche" ("bourgeois") concept of language, which holds, "Das Mittel der Mitteilung ist das Wort, ihr Gegenstand die Sache, ihr Addressat ein Mensch" ("[T]he means of communication is the word, its ob ject factual, its addressee a human being"; "Uber Sprache" 144; "On Language" 318). Its rejection, in this early essay, takes the form of a partial reenchantment ofthe word, regrant ing to nature the language stripped from it by modernity and imputing both spirit (Geist) and irreducible spiritual "essence" (geistige We sen) to all beings, in an explicit challenge to the preeminence of human reason (Hanssen 58). Beings, for Benjamin, communicate {mit teilen) their spiritual essences not through but in language. Language is neither an essence nor a sensory medium but a medium (das Mediale) in an extended sense: that through which a being reveals what of its spiritual es sence is communicable in and as language ("Uber Sprache" 142; "On Language" 315-16). To explain the relation between this lan guage of things and human language, Ben jamin turns, in the second part of "Uber Sprache," to the story ofthe Creation in Gen esis 1. He observes that the creative power of God's word is absolute; at the same time, God endows humanity with the gift of language, in the power to name (149; 323). Although human naming (erkennende Namen) thus is an activity secondary to the omnipotence of divine words, it serves to differentiate human beings from other creatures (149; 323). Hu man language is then an echo of the divine word, translating the language of things into the human order (152; 325), and this transla tion is at once an ontological action (the mute object is incomplete until it is named) and an ethical action (the naming and named levels of creation are bonded). Benjamin's understanding of language here does not oppose bourgeois instrumental communication (which presumes to represent the world directly) to metonymic dissemina tion (in the deferral of representation by the arbitrary character ofthe sign). We can only call his view of language symbolic: "Es ist namlich Sprache in jedem Falle nicht allein Mitteilung des Mitteilbaren, sondern zugleich Symbol des Nicht-Mitteilbaren.... Diese ha ben nicht allein eine mitteilende, sondern ... auch eine mit ihr eng verbundene symbolische Funktion" ("Language is in every case not only communication of the communicable but also, at the same time, a symbol of the noncommunicable-Names have not only a communicating function, but... also a closely connected symbolic function" (156; 331).18 The</page><page sequence="12">52 Modernity and Its Fallen Languages: Tanpinar's Hasret, Benjamin's Melancholy PMLA end that modernity brings to language's sym bolic function is then not a gain but a loss: the Fall, in Benjamin's conception, foreclosing the naming power of human language, translating it into multiple, abstract, and imperfect lan guages. This fallen state of human language, no longer "benannt... aus der einen seligen Paradiesessprache der Namen, sondern aus den hunderten Menschensprachen, in denen der Namen schon welkte" ("named from the one blessed, paradisiac language of names, but from the hundred languages of man, in which name has already withered"), produces modern melancholy (155; 330). In the later essays "Der Erzahler" (1936; "The Storyteller") and "Uber einige Motive bei Baudelaire" (1939), Benjamin would write of the newspaper as a key agent of this dis enchantment of language, further displacing the oral culture of storytelling and substitut ing for this symbolic function of language the instrumentality of discourse as "an und fur sich verstandlich" ("understandable in and for itself"; "Erzahler" 390; "Storyteller" 88-89). Work is yet to be done?or, at least, yet to be meaningfully assimilated into the mainstream of comparative scholarship?on the relation of German language reforms of the early twentieth century to the language theories of thinkers like Benjamin, whose scholarly popularization turns on the ap parent privilege he granted to mass-media technologies, a privilege easily (too easily) ap propriated for the analysis of a late-twentieth century techne Benjamin did not live to see.19 But even the canonical Benjamin essays ofthe interwar period might be read less schemati cally than they usually are, for the ambiva lence contained in the topos of melancholy. For Benjamin, as for Tanpinar, in a world of disenchanted language the modern subject can no longer experience (erfahren) in the old, true sense of that term: rather, now, they live in a present tense of successive, uniform, empty intervals, severed from past and future ("Uber einige Motive" 212; "On Some Motifs" 179). If we read Benjamin closely, in the po etry of Baudelaire, the novels of Proust, and the tales of Poe, he finds ways to affirm, as well as to lament, the experience ofthe mod ern. If Baudelaire's melancholic gaze, in Ben jamin's reading, dwells on the horrors ofthe modern world, it also captures that world's enchantments (199; 169). And whereas Proust fashions from memoire involontaire the only crisis-proof reconstitution of real experience, it is in the empty, homogeneous time of mo dernity that its "flashes"?"amorphous (bild los) and formless, indefinite (unbestimmt) and weighty"?register the loss ofthe past as experience ("Zum Bilde" 347; "Image" 214). In the autobiographical "Berliner Chronik" (1932; "Berlin Chronicle"), Benjamin wrote: Die Sprache hat es unmifiverstandlich bedeu tet, dafi das Gedachtnis nicht ein Instrument zur Erkundung der Vergangenheit ist sondern deren Schauplatz. Es ist das Medium des Erleb ten wie das Erdreich das Medium ist, in dem die toten Stadte verschuttet liegen. Wer sich der eigenen verschutteten Vergangenheit zu nahern trachtet, mufi sich verhalten wie ein Mann, der grabt. Das bestimmt den Ton, die Haltung echter Erinnerungen. Sie diirfen sich nicht scheuen, immer wieder auf einen und denselben Sachverhalt zuruckzukommen; ihn auszustreuen wie man Erde ausstreut, ihn um zuwuhlen wie man Erdreich umwuhlt. (486) Language shows clearly that memory is not an instrument for exploring the past but its the ater. It is the medium of past experience, as the ground is the medium in which dead cit ies lie interred. He who seeks to approach his own buried past must conduct himself like a man digging. This confers the tone and bear ing of genuine reminiscences. He must not be afraid to return again and again to the same matter; to scatter it as one scatters earth, to turn it over as one turns over soil. (25-26) The allegorical language of the modern poet does not restore the lost past in its wholeness but rather represents, in alienation and rec</page><page sequence="13">12 3-1 1 Ner8's Erturk 53 onciliation, the passage of time, in and into modernity. Language here is a medium in the extended sense, which includes and registers, without being able fully to represent, violent transformations of the historical conditions of possibility for its own use. The ghosts ofthe past here are ruins to which language is com pared, not as lingering presences but as absent ones, in an image remarkably similar to that of Tanpinar's pile of names in the broken marble ofthe ?erefabad Summer Palace. "Once cul ture and civilization vanish," Tanpinar wrote in "Istanbul'un Mevsimleri ve Sanatlartmiz" ("Istanbul's Seasons and Our Arts"), "the angels that used to wait by the side of each letter trans form into noble, geometrical figures" (121). One is tempted to say that Benjamin's linguistic debris mixes with Tanpinar's, re vealing both crucial differences and remote continuities, and that this is one (small and not the only) way we might address the ur gency to figure new forms, modes, and practices of comparison in and for today's disciplines. That Benjamin and Tanpinar thus appear closer than current structures of vision permit them to be may be a lapse in professional global knowledge (of Tanpinar's works if not of Benjamin's)?a lapse that can be remedied by greater local knowledge of a Turkey now understood everywhere in the liberal wing of our profession to be as crucial to comparative literature as to other, more practical projects for European community. But we have more than that here, something more substantial than inclusion in remedial representation: an invitation to revisit the comparative categories of modernity (West and East, Europe and Turkey) and the disci plinary divisions structured by them. Notes I thank David Damrosch, Sibel Erol, Ursula Heise, Brian Lennon, Martin Puchner, Dermot Ryan, Ozge Serin, and Nadir Sohrabi for their feedback on earlier versions of this essay. 1. On Istanbul as a birthplace of comparative litera ture, see also Apter, "Comparative Exile." 2. Kasaba provides a useful definition ofthe relevant terms here. "Incorporation refers to a two-fold process: one is the establishment of links between the production processes of an external arena and the loci of produc tion and consumption in the capitalist world economy; the other, is the integration ofthe political structures of this area into the interstate network ofthe world system" (4). Peripheralization refers to "the status of a zone in the world economy" (5). Ottoman peripheralization has been studied extensively, especially under 1960s Marxist and 1970s neo-Marxist influences on Turkish history writing. See Keyder 25-40 for a useful macrosociological analysis of Ottoman peripheralization. 3. On the rationalist, positivist roots ofthe Kemalist revolution, see Kazancigil and Ozbudun. 4. Unless otherwise indicated, all translations from Turkish into English are mine. 5. See Tanpinar, "Antalyah Gene. Kiza Mektup," con sidered his manifesto of literary influence. On the con cept of "belated modernity," see Jusdanis (esp. the introd. [xi-xviii]). 6. Such affirmation may be one danger, for example, ofthe model proposed by Benedict Anderson in The Spec tre of Comparisons, discussed in the following section. 7. For sources in English on modern Turkish literature, see Finn; Evin. See also Irzik and Guzeldere for a selection of recent articles published in English on debates around modern Turkish literature and culture. Walter G. An drews's Poetry's Voice, Society's Song and Victoria R. Hol brook's The Unreadable Shores of Love are valuable works in English on Ottoman poetry. Work on Tanpinar in En glish includes Goknar; Feldman; Oguzertem; and Atis. 8. Giirbilek focuses on some ofthe same passages I discuss here, invoking as well the concept of hasret? though the Turkish language reforms do not play a part in her account. Her Yer Degistiren Golge 11-23 is an ear lier Benjaminian reading of Tanpinar. 9. Chatterjee objects to Anderson's presupposition of universally experienced "empty homogeneous time," which is "the Utopian time of capital," and to his substitu tion of Utopian time for the true heterogeneous time of modernity (166). Harootunian criticizes Chatterjee for seeking alternative modernities in a romantic zone outside the time of capital. Harootunian agrees with Anderson's serialization theory while criticizing his Eurocentrism, noting that colonized space is not simply "shadowed" by European modernity but positively haunted by ghosts that return from the premodern past, interrupting the histori cal present ofthe modern ("Ghostly Comparisons" 189). 10. Morris contextualizes Foucault's analysis of money in Marx's analysis ofthe commodity: the generalization</page><page sequence="14">54 Modernity and Its Fallen Languages: Tanpinar's Hasret, Benjamin's Melancholy PMLA ofthe commodity form is not merely a repetition ofthe emergence of capital in the free exchange of labor power; rather, it refers to the intensified monetization of mer chants' and usurers' capital, which in both European capi talism and the Ottoman Empire precedes capital proper and the institution of wage labor as the dominant social relation. As Marx writes, "[B]oth merchants' capital and interest-bearing capital are derivative forms, and at the same time ... historically, these two forms appear before the modern primary form of capital" {Das Kapital 1 166; Capital 1 267). The commodity form, in other words, ap pears when the producer produces not for immediate use but for exchange; it is common to many diverse "economic social formations" (171; 273). Money, then, is capital's "first form of appearance" (149; 247), though money and capital are not the same thing. Marx continues: "we know... that a relatively feeble development of commodity circulation suffices for the creation of all... forms [of money]. It is otherwise with capital.... [Capital] arises only when the owner ofthe means of production and subsistence finds the free worker available, on the market, as the seller of his own labor-power" (171; 274). On this point, besides the work cited in n2 on Ottoman peripheralization, see Akyildiz for a monetary history ofthe nineteenth cen tury that deals specifically with the first Ottoman paper currency {kaime); for an account of Ottoman money that begins in the thirteenth century, see Pamuk. 11. See Parla 105-24 for an influential reading ofthe novel. Parla argues that the novel registers the Ottoman cultural crisis of representation and communication. In my reading, what is foreclosed in the novel is not the pos sibility of representation, as suggested by Parla, but that of overcoming representation. 12. See Demiralp 59-74 for an analysis of Tanpinar's concept of history. 13. "Ferahfeza" refers to a composition by the re nowned Ottoman classical composer Ismail Dede Efendi (1778-1846). Karacaahmed Cemetery is located in the Uskiidar district of Istanbul; it is known for its centuries old cypress groves. $erefabad Palace, also in Uskiidar, was constructed by Murad IV (1612-40), demolished in 1794, and rebuilt several times subsequently. 14. A historical account in English is Lewis. See also Sadoglu, who begins with the mid-nineteenth century, when standardization programs for Ottoman Turkish (including a debated script change) had already begun. 15. For this reading ofthe Derrida passage, see Mor ris 48-49. One might acknowledge here as well Marshall McLuhan's The Gutenberg Galaxy. His essentialism and ahistoricism notwithstanding, McLuhan produced a valuable analysis ofthe social and political effects ofthe phonetic alphabet and print technology. 16. Hanssen suggests that we "address Benjamin's complex language theory?sometimes neglected in favor of more accessible work, such as the technology essay ?in order to unlock how modernity's progressive aes theticization ofthe cultural field occurred at the expense of an unalloyed purity of language" (57). She argues that "Benjamin ... sought to ... avert language's reduction to a mere means of communication, the trafficking in worn out coins, exploited for their exchange-value?whether perpetrated by the jargon of neo-Kantianism or the empty slogans wielded by at least part of modernity's mass media culture" (69). I thank Ozge Serin for her in sights on Benjamin's "Uber Sprache." 17. A later turn in Benjamin's language theory is found in "Uber das mimetische Vermogen" (1933; "On the Mi metic Faculty"). In Benjamin's phylogenetic account of mimesis, human beings are endowed with the mimetic faculty of producing and recognizing similarities, and "[d]ergestalt ware die Sprache die hochste Stufe des mi metischen Verhaltens und das vollkommenste Archiv der unsinnlichen Ahnlichkeit" ("language may be seen as the highest level of mimetic behavior and the most complete archive of nonsensuous similarities"; 213; 336). 18. In "Die Aufgabe des Ubersetzers" (1921; "The Task ofthe Translator"), Benjamin writes, "Es bleibt in aller Sprache und ihren Gebilden aufier dem Mitteilbaren ein Nicht-Mitteilbares, ein, je nach dem Zusammenhang, in dem es angetroffen wird, Symbolisierendes oder Sym bolisiertes. ... Wenn aber dieser, ob verborgen oder fragmentarisch, dennoch gegenwartig im Leben als das Symbolisierte selbst ist, so wohnt er nur symbolisierend in den Gebilden" ("In all language and linguistic creations there remains in addition to what can be conveyed some thing that cannot be communicated; depending on the context in which it appears, it is something that symbol izes or something symbolized_Though concealed and fragmentary, it is an active force in life as the symbolized thing itself, whereas it inhabits linguistic creations only in symbolized form"; 60; 79). Authentic translation aspires to transform human-language symbolization into the sym bolization of pure language. In Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels (1928; The Origin of German Tragic Drama), meanwhile, Benjamin writes that the Romantic symbol, a theological construct that the Romantics introduced into aesthetics, meant more than the representation ofthe di vine: "Als symbolisches Gebilde soil das Schone bruchlos ins Gottliche ubergehen" ("As a symbolic construct, the beautiful is supposed to merge with the divine in an un broken whole"; 175; 160). He rejects this construct, since it erases the breaks in history, reducing "[d]as Zeitmafi ... das mystische Nu" ("the measure of time ... [to] the mystical instant"; 182; 165). Allegory, by contrast, reveals nature in its inevitable decay in time (197; 178). 19.1 have in mind here, of course, "Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner technischen Reproduzierbarkeit." Early twentieth-century German language reforms included the standardization of orthography and pronunciation and the replacement of Gothic script (Fraktur, Ecken schrift) with Roman letters (Antiqua, Rundschrift). Wa terman is a useful source on German language reforms.</page><page sequence="15">12 3.1 1 Ner8's ErtQrk 55 Works Cited Ahmet Ha?im. "Harf Inkilabi." Ikdam 22 Nov. 1928. Rpt. in Yorulmaz 314-15. -.
