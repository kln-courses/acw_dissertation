<plain_text><page sequence="1">Folklore vol. 93:ii, 1982 166 The Quack Doctor in the Russian Folk and Popular Theatre ELIZABETH A. WARNER VIOLET Alford wrote: 'In the farces, still sometimes played in La Soule, a Doctor often appears. He tells boastfully of his travels and the far countries in which he learnt his work. "Apres avoir fait le tour de la Prussie, et de la Russie, de l'Angleterre et de la Turquie je suis revenu chez moi:" In almost the same words does the Doctor of our Mummers' Play extol himself. It is quite likely that the Masquerade Doctor used the same stock phrases. Where do they come from?" Miss Alford's puzzlement at the similarities between the Basque and English Doctors is understandable and might apply equally well to other national parallels, for the comic Doctor in one guise or another is one of the most ubiquitous characters of popular theatre and embryonic dramatic' forms across Europe. Wace's description of the Doctor in a play performed by villagers from Semarina in the Pindus ('First he felt the pulse, then he listened at the soles of the feet to see if the heart was beating . ..)2 must strike a familiar note to anyone who has watched an English Hero-Combat Play, and Frazer's Dr. Iron-Beard from Swabia, who bleeds a sick man 'who thereupon falls as dead to the ground' but whom he subsequently restores to life 'by blowing air into him through a tube,'3 is likewise a part of an age-old European tradition. The Basque mummer spoke of his visit to Russia. Curiously enough in Russia, as it happens, the comic Doctor has a long and complex pedigree in the world of popular entertainment. In his earliest form he took part in the New Year and spring fertility games which involved the death and resurrection of a goat, horse, bull or some anthro- pomorphic figure. He was the central figure in the cycles of farcical interludes, originally performed between the serious acts of plays in the repertoire of the Academic theatres in the late 17th and 18th centuries, but which in the hands of serm professional and amateur troupes later in the 18th century became independant ,liay- lets. There are four such plays on the theme of the charlatan doctor, for example, in the 18th century Titov collection.4 He is a stock character of the two types of puppet theatre known in Russia, the theatre of rod puppets, the vertep, and Petrushka, both of which were introduced from Western Europe and were already widespread by the 17th century. He appears on 18th-century broadsheets and in the Harlequinades and panto- mimes loosely based on the Commedia dell' Arte characters which could be found in theatres for the entertainment of the masses throughout the 19th century. Maskers at Christmastide and other periods of festivity often incorporated the comic Doctor into their disguises and games. Last, but certainly not least, he was to be found in variants of all the main plays of the repertoire of the folk theatre, in particular Tsar Maksimilian and Lodka (The Ship). In the folk plays, which were performed by amateurs mainly during the period of festivities between 24th December and 6th January, the Doctor was summoned to attend one of the knights who have fallen in the series of duels with Tsar Maksimilian's champion Anika (in the play Lodka, the victim is one of the robber band</page><page sequence="2">THE QUACK DOCTOR 167 or their captive, old Preklonskii), or to cure the gravedigger, whose function it is to remove the bodies. The scene begins with the Doctor's speech of introduction: 'Good-day fine sirs, here am I the doctor.' The word 'doctor' is usually conveyed not by the respectable medical term doktor but by the word lekar' which is used for someone not properly qualified or for a quack. In the 19th century it was a term of disparagement, as shown by this quotation from Dostoevskii in Ushakov's dictionary: 'He used the term lekar' instead of doktor deliberately, as he announced afterwards, "to cause offence." ' The speech of introduction continues: 'Here am I the doctor, the chemist who lives under the Stone Bridge.' This reference reveals the Doctor's character and social standing in the eyes of the audience. In the 18th and early 19th centuries the Stone Bridge in Moscow was a notorious haunt of thieves, cut-throats and tramps who camped out on the river bank. As will be seen later, the Doctor of the popular theatre is depicted not only as a bumbling idiot and deceiving charlatan but as an individual with many unpleasant traits. He is sometimes lecherous. In the 18th-century comedy The Fool, the French Doctor and the Young Woman (Gaer, Doktor-Frantsuz, Moloditsa), the Fool says of him ironically 'He's not the sort to get the ladies on their backs with their legs in the air.'5 In his speech of introduction too the Doctor often makes some reference to his nationality. He is almost invariably a foreigner, frequently German. In one version of Tsar Maksimilian he speaks with a heavy German accent and calls Maksimilian 'Herr Tsar.' An interesting contemporary reworking of the same theme may be found in The Robber Band (Shaika razboinikov, a variant of The Ship), collected in 1942 in German- occupied territory. Here there is a doctor from Berlin who treats his patients in stereo- type Nazi fashion: 'There's no point in feeding the wounded, it's cheaper to kill them off.'6 There are also French doctors in the folk plays, but a surprising number appear to be English or to have come to Russia from England or, in one case, from Dublin. 'I have come to you here from England,' says one, 'I am a real English doctor.' 'Hello, honoured sirs,' announces another, 'I have come to you here from England. Do you know who I am? A Turk? A German or a Pole?' In yet another text the doctor describes himself as 'not a Russian or a Prussian. I am chief doctor Foma' (i.e. Thomas-an echo of the English Dr. Thomas?). Statements like the following, from The Robber Band, indicate a certain degree of confusion in the minds of provincial and country-dwelling players, for whom the capital cities of Moscow and Petersburg were often as remote as Paris or London, as to what exactly constituted foreignness: 'I am not Rusian, I am not French, I am the doctor from Petersburg.'7 Occasionally, especially in the puppet play Petrushka, the doctor mentions the countries he has visited to acquire his medical knowledge and skills. Here we find a stylistic parallel with the English drama, whose play on sound in phrases like 'I've been to Italy, spitally' may be heard again in the Rusian 'Bylya v Italii, bylya i dalee' ('I've been to Italy, I've been further'). Although the description of the Doctor's travels occurs rarely in the folk plays themselves, it can be found in other types of popular theatre. In the 18th-century comic scene, The Foreign-Quack, the Fool and the Barber (Lekar'-inozemets, Gaer, Tsyryul'nik), the doctor enters, addresses the audience and explains that he has just returned from a foreign tour: 'Not long ago I was in Holland and came here from Amsterdam by ship. In Holland I learnt the noble science of medicine. From there I went all over England and now I am looking upon Moscow. It's true I was a fine doctor over there, head of the hospital.'8 This reference to the Doctor's having learnt his trade in Holland is intriguing. In</page><page sequence="3">168 ELIZABETH A. WARNER 18th-century Russia the performance of plays was an integral part of the programme of the Spiritual Academies. Hence the term 'Academic' or 'School' theatres. The medical school, founded in 1706 by Peter the Great, drew quite a number of its pupils from these Academies, and it is known that the performance of plays was a popular pastime there in the first quarter of the 18th century. The first director of this school was a Dutchman, Nicholas Bidleau. Another connecting link between Holland and the popular theatre may be seen in the 18th-century broadsheets entitled The Dutch Doctor and Kind Chemist. These broadsheets are among those collected and annotated by the 19th-century art historian D. Rovinskii. One of them, engraved at the Akhmet'ev workshops in the latter half of the 18th century, depicts an ingenious invention for converting old women into young. Rovinskii describes the scene as follows: The Dutch Doctor stands on the left with a large club in his hand; an old woman is handing him an envelope with the legend '90 years of age;' on the right, two husbands are trundling their old wives towards him in wheelbarrows. The actual process of rejuvenating the wives takes place in the background; in the middle are two huge stoves with flames shooting out high in the air; a little to one side a small boy is working the bellows; workmen carry the old women naked up a staircase and fling them into the stove, from the bottom end of which they later jump out as young ones. The picture is accompanied by a text in which the doctor boasts of his accomplishment: 'who else has the skill to turn old women into young,' he concludes, 'People know I can do it and everywhere sing my praises.'9 It is possible, as Rovinskii himself suggested, that the Russian engraving is based upon a German original by Lucas Cranach which shows the old men bringing their wives in cartloads to a rejuvenating lake. However, the theme of rejuvenation by fire is also well-known in Russian folk-tales. In The Smith and the Demon a fine lady pays 500 roubles to the devil in order to be made young again. The devil, who is apprenticed to a smith, 'took a pair of tongs, caught hold of the lady by the feet, flung her into the furnace, and burnt her up; nothing was left of her but her bare bones,' then he dropped the bones into a tub of milk and 'just fancy! at the end of about three minutes the lady emerged from the milk-alive, and young, and beautiful!'10 In some versions of Tsar Maksimilian, the quack boasts that he too has this miraculous power, but a more obvious link between the broadsheet and the popular theatre may be seen in the pantomime The Magic Mill, where Old Women are turned into Young which was all the rage at Berg's theatre on Admiralty Square in Petersburg during the 1870's. Berg's was famous at the time for its technical skills and trompe l'oeil effects. The poster advertising the pantomime shows a scene very close to that on the broadsheet. On the left, a queue of old ladies leaning on walking sticks hobbles up a staircase. On a landing at the top is the 'magic mill,' looking like a large mixing machine, with a bowl into which the assistant flings the old ladies head-first, and many strange cog-wheels and ratchets. Down below, the clients emerge through a door, transformed into young beauties wearing short ballet skirts. To the right of the scene stands the 'magician' owner in a long robe and tall pointed cap. In the foreground an old man trundles his bespectacled wife in a wheelbarrow to take her place in the queue." The convention by which the quack Doctor is depicted as a foreigner is one which goes back a long way in the history of the Russian theatre. Oleonskaya, writing of the 18th-century Interludes, comments: 'The ignorant doctor in these Interludes was usually a deceitful gypsy or a Frenchman.'12 On the same subject Kuzmina has this to say: 'It should be noted that the quack doctor is usually a foreigner, a gypsy, a Pole or a Frenchman."3 In the four Interludes from the Titov collection to which she refers specifically, one doctor is French, two are gypsies and one is a Pole.</page><page sequence="4">THE QUACK DOCTOR 169 One of the most interesting and lively early plays with a quack Doctor is reputedly an Interlude from the allegorical play Stefanotokos written in the mid-18th century to celebrate the accession of the Empress Elizabeth. The Doctor is German by birth but speaks Latin as befits his calling: 'O quam-pulsus est gravis!' he exclaims to his 'patient,' an ignorant gypsy, whose command of Russian is not a lot better than the Doctor's. The following scene contains elements which, a century and more later, were still to be found in plays of the folk repertoire such as Tsar Maksimilian. There is, for example, the comic device of 'mishearing,' one of the most common verbal comic effects of the Russian folk theatre. In the Interlude this stems from the combination of the Doctor's Latin and German accent and the gypsy's mangled Russian, interpreted, or rather misinterpreted, by a helpful servant. The gypsy complains he is starving, not a morsel has passed his lips (guby). This is mistranslated by the servant as toothache (zuby-teeth). 'Dolor upi?' chimes in the doctor, who hasn't understood either of them. It's his dentes that ache, replies the servant helpfully. The confusion results in the gypsy sitting down in a chair with his mouth open thinking he is about to be fed, but instead he has his teeth pulled out."' In the mocking attitude to the German Doctor of this Interlude Eleonskaya sees a direct parallel to the xenophobic theme of Stefanotokos, to which it is attached. Stephanotokos was a biting allegory on the miserable reign of Anne (1730-1740), former Duchess of Kurland, who turned the Russian Court into a replica of the Court at Mitau, everywhere preferring and exalting German over native Russian talent and birth. As Sir Bernard Pares put it: 'Russia had an experience of German rule which left a lasting impression; it was remembered as a time of drunken Court revels when the people were treated like dogs."' Eventually the exasperation of the Russian nobility led to a palace coup in 1741 which placed Elizabeth, youngest daughter of Peter the Great, upon the throne. The Polish- Lithuanian Intervention at the beginning of the 17th century in support of the false Pretender Dmitrii had also left bitter memories of foreigners. But there was also a more general current of anti-foreign feeling in Russia which manifested itself at various times during the 17th and 18th centuries. In the earlier period it was connected with the rampant fear of witchcraft and heathenish practices often attributed to non-Orthodox foreigners. 'Take that you swindler, you un- christened pate!' is one of the insults flung at the German Doctor in the Stefanotokos Interlude.6" Particularly at risk were technicians and professional people living in the foreign quarter of Moscow, whose skills were often regarded with deep suspicion, and by association, those Russians who had dealings with them. In 1677 the Boyarin Artomon Sergeevich Matveev was denounced by his enemies to the Tsar Fedor Alek- seevich for allegedly reading a book of black magic together with a certain Dr. Stefan, in the course of which a host of evil spirits entered the room and communed with them. It was further suggested that Matveev and his son Andryusha had taken instruction in the black arts from one Nikolai Spoforii.17 In his defence Matveev later revealed that the book in question had been a medical work. In the first quarter of the 18th century Peter the Great forcibly turned Russia's face towards Europe by inaugurating a programme of drastic reforms in all areas of life, which antagonised many Russians. As a result large numbers of foreign advisors, among them, no doubt, inadequate and underqualified people, were invited to the country. By the end of the century the Europeanising process had gone too far and there was a national reaction against the prevailing tendency to praise everything foreign, whether it be in literature, fashions, hair-styles or one's choice of medical man, and the denigration of anything home-grown. Perhaps the best known satirical</page><page sequence="5">170 ELIZABETH A. WARNER depiction of the semi-literate foreign professional in 18th-century Russia is Fonvizin's German tutor Vral'man (vrat'=to lie) in the comedy Nedorosl' (The Minor, 1782). Doctors of foreign origin survived well into the 19th century in the conventions both of the real world and literature and the stage. Tolstoy treated the medical profession as a whole with disdain and mistrust, and although the doctors who figure on the pages of War and Peace are many stages removed from the quack of the folk plays and the Interludes there is nevertheless a familiar mocking note in his description of Dr. Lorrain, physician to the dying Count Bezukhov: ' "Prince, humanum est errarre, but . ." replied the doctor, swallowing his r's, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French accent.' Later, we find Tolstoy's jibes against the gaggle of doctors who try in vain to cure Natasha, pining of a broken heart and shame: 'Doctors came to see her singly and in consultation, talked much in French, German and Latin, blamed one another, and prescribed a great variety of medicines for all the diseases known to them, but the simple idea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the disease Natasha was suffering from ...,s Much closer to the characters of popular theatre whom we have been examining is Nikolai Gogol's provincial doctor (lekar), Khristian Ivanovich Gibner, in his famous play The Government Inspector (Revizor), first performed April 19th, 1836. Khristian Ivanovich has difficulty communicating with his patients because he doesn't know a single word of Russian, indeed throughout the play he never succeeds in producing more than an inarticulate sound, and although his name is German sounding it is also connected with the Russian gibel'='death/destruction,' and gibnut'='to perish,' a reflection on the high death rate in his slovenly hospital. After introducing himself to the audience the Quack Doctor of the folk plays proceeds to ennumerate his skills, which vary considerably from one text to another, but are all of the same improbable type: 'I can cure you, kill you stone dead in three minutes'-'Patients come to me on their own two feet but they leave in a hearse/on crutches'-'I can get blood out of a corpse'-etc., etc. A more extensive list of boasts may be found in a variant of Tsar Maksimilian collected by Vinogradov:- 'I know how to cure I know how to steal I know how to fly I know how to part people from this earth! I cut out healthy (live) parts and put dead ones in their place I do blood-letting, Cure women, Poke out eyes ...'19 Some Doctors, like their Dutch counterpart, can 'change the old into young.'20 As can be inferred from the above examples, the Doctor's past patients are not usually available to corroborate or deny his claims. This is equally true of the Interludes:- 'I cured a man of the fever, for which he was very grateful,' exclaims the doctor from Amsterdam. 'I gave him a laxative so he didn't eat for a week. I hardly recognized him afterwards. I recognized his face in the mortuary though.'21 Even Gogol's Dr. Gibner follows the same convention. When the false Government Inspector, Khlestakov, comments on the small number of patients in the clinic, he is</page><page sequence="6">THE QUACK DOCTOR 171 told that the sick 'get well like flies.' One of the standard scenes of the Russian folk theatre is the dialogue between patient and quack in which the sick person lists the various parts of his body which are giving him trouble (head, back, belly, eyes, nose, teeth, arms, legs, bowels etc.) and the Doctor offers advice, absurd remedies ('your belly's bad? Eat 33 water melons'), which will obviously make the patient worse or finish him off. Textual and structural similarities here lead one to suppose that the folk actors borrowed their material from the quack Doctor cycles of 18th century Interludes, introducing their own variations. Compare for example the following from The Ermak Play (a variant of The Ship)22 and Tsar Maksimilian23 respectively with corresponding extracts from the Interlude The Gypsy-Quack, The Old Man, The Old Woman and the Fool:-24 'If your head aches shave it down to the skull, Rub thick beer dregs all over it to make it ache worse than ever, then rub it with boiling water to stop the heat of the fever ripping you apart' and:- 'Take hold of your nose, rip it off, throw it out in the frost and your nose will get well!' (from the folk plays) 'If your head aches, shave it to the skull and when you've shaved it, cook it in boiling water, and fry the back of your neck with fire' and:- Twist your face round to the back of your neck Go out into the frost, until your nose freezes off (from the interlude) In versions of folk plays recorded in this century more specific ailments have crept into the diagnosis. 'A bad heart and pneumonia' is the verdict in a 1940's variant of the game/drama Kostroma from the Bryansk Province in Southern Russia, and it's 'tuberculosis and pneumonia' in a 1960's version of the 'doctor and patient' scene from Gorkii Province. The lists of ailments and accompanying absurd or dangerous remedies in both the folk theatre and the 18th-century Interludes may be linked to another type of satirical literature, the parody medical manuals of the preceding century, in particular A Manual for the Cure of Foreigners, in which, however, the roles are reversed, for the manual has been 'issued by the Russian people' and the foreigner is himself the patient. If the unfortunate man here had acted upon the instructions given and taken his 'medicine' he would have ended up armless, legless and generally dead.25 As may be imagined, many of the suggested cures, the jokes and horse-play of this scene are at the least crude and often obscene. There is a preoccupation, especially in the Interludes, with bodily functions and in particular with malfunction of the bowels. In The Sick Fool, the Pole and the Old Man the fool moans and groans throughout the playlet from the pain of incessant diarrhoea and ends up with a stomach swollen to twice its normal size from the large doses of turnip the Doctor has recommended as a cure.26 It is not unusual for the cure to involve some sort of sexual connotations, although censorship of the folk plays often makes it difficult to see exactly what is being suggested. In The Fool, the French Doctor and the Young Woman, the fool, who complains of every conceivable ache and pain, is led to the communal bath-house (places noted for immoral behaviour in the 17th and 18th centuries), where a beautiful</page><page sequence="7">172 ELIZABETH A. WARNER young woman soon cures him of all his ills.27 In this element of the plays it is not difficult to discern a link with the themes of Russian pornographic folk tales. The aforementioned episode is close to the tale of the drunken soldier who, suffering an attack of breathlessness, decided to consult a female doctor/wise woman (lekarka). She gave him a huge glass of vodka, after which he fell sound asleep on the bed. But during the night he woke up to find himself lying next to the woman. A little shy at first, he was encouraged to proceed in his attentions by her suggestion that the patient 'would feel much better afterwards.'28 Similarly, the fool in one Interlude, who is duped into believing his sickness is caused by a piglet running about in his stomach,29 is not unlike the lecherous priest who is told he has given birth to a calf in the night.3" In the folk plays the patient, the old gravedigger, often has a large phallus attached. Through this character a link is established between the scene of the cure and the Russian ritual games connected with the agricultural cycle and the concept of fertility and growth in nature. These games, such as Yarilo and Kostroma and the goat and horse maskings which took place during Christmas and over the spring and early summer period, involved the death and resurrection of a masked animal or a puppet of male or female form with exaggerated sexual parts. These and many other games and rites connected with remembrance of the dead almost invariably contained erotic elements. The characteristic features of the old gravedigger's appearance, his straw- filled humpback, his long dishevelled hair and sheepskin coat turned inside out, as well as his obscene gestures and antics, without doubt make him a close relative of these anthropomorphic figures. In the folk plays, however, the underlying purposefulness of the figure has been lost. Much capital is also made out of drunkenness in these scenes. The Doctor's assistant staggers on stage drunk, singing and hiccupping, carrying a huge bottle. The Doctor prescribes a massive dose of vodka, or orders various parts of the patient's anatomy to be stuffed with barrel-loads of alcohol. The Doctor usually participates in cures of this nature himself. Less common in the folk theatre are the comic 'prescriptions' with which the quack tries to fob off his victims ('take milk from a hare, sour cream from a dog,' etc.), and here again the initial inspiration has undoubtedly come from the 18th century where in the Interludes, for example, we may find the following uninviting ingredients:- 'Take two measures of bears' roar Two measures of shit A duck's quack A goose's cackle A mouse's squeak A pig's grunt A sheep's bleat And a cow's moo; Mix it up well and grind to a powder; to be taken while standing out in the frost.'31 Similarly, in the Manual for the Cure of Foreigners the patient is exhorted to take (among many other unlikely potions): '3 drops of virgins' milk, 16 measures of thick bear's roar, 4 arshins of an eagle's flight, 6 measures of loud cats' purr and half a pound of chickens' cackle.'32 It goes without saying that the cures effected in the plays under discussion consisted of more than mere verbal treatments. The scenes involving the doctor were among the most lively and active of the folk theatre, for if the 'serious' parts of the plays, such as the execution of Prince Adol'f or the duel scenes, seemed rather stilted and static, the</page><page sequence="8">THE QUACK DOCTOR 173 comic scenes allowed the actors' imagination free range. The patient was man-handled, dragged about the floor by his feet, had his wounds roughly bandaged, was prodded and poked and examined, was offered injections and enemas, all in the most undignified manner. Among the set pieces of this action was what might be termed the 'higher/lower' motif, which occurred most frequently in the puppet play Petrushka. Here, the Doctor would vainly try to locate the source of the pain, while his unhelpful patient sent him on a wild goose chase now to higher, now to lower parts of his anatomy. The same procedure may be found in 19th-century variants of Mr. Punch, and it is probable that this element entered the Russian theatre from Western Europe. In the folk plays the scene with the comic Doctor sometimes ended with a miraculous cure or revival. Here, as with the gravedigger, there has clearly been some cross-fertilisation between the folk theatre and the ritual games and maskings. In these the revival was frequently achieved without the intervention of any medical help, indeed the death itself was by no means always accompanied by a resurrection. In the game Kostroma, for example, the puppet or girl playing the central role was placed in a coffin or a funeral bier which was then carried to the nearest pond or river to the accompaniment of weeping and keening. After a mock funeral service the 'corpse' was flung into the river. Among some peoples of the Northern Caucasus, a special procession was held by the ploughmen in honour of fertility. Their leader, the fool, wearing a tail and a wooden phallus, performed all sorts of tricks before falling down dead before each house in the village. He came to after the householder brought out gifts and money.33 Of interest too are those rare variants of the 'corpse' game (pokoinitskaya igra) mainly recorded in Northern Russia, in the Archangel Government, in which the 'corpse' actually springs to life again. As Nina Savushkina points out, the prevailing mood here is one not of joy but of terror.34 These scenes are reminiscent of the many grisly Northern folktales which tell of widows relentlessly pursued by cannibalistic revenants, who can be stilled only by an aspen stake thrust through the heart. In the goat and horse games of the Christmas and New Year period the animals cavort and play for a time and the goat butts the girls and tries to poke his horns up their skirts, then they fall sick and in many cases a wise-man or woman is called in to cure them by sprinkling water, by blowing in the animal's ear or by reading a 'prayer' over it. Some later recordings of the game Kostroma, in which the dramatic potential of the 'plot' has taken over from its original functional meaning, contain a well-developed 'doctor and patient' scene close to the folk plays proper. In variants from the Bryansk region collected in the 1940's the patient is not dead but seriously ill, and the hoped-for cure is effected not by the medical profession but by the mock priest. After an extended figure dance in which Kostroma, played by one of the village women, demonstrates through mimetic gestures all the processes involved in weaving a piece of cloth, she returns home, exhausted by her work, eats a hearty meal and falls ill. First, a wise-man from the neighbouring village is sent for, but he is out. Then the local medical auxiliary comes and gives her a powder for her bad heart and pneumonia.35 A resurrection scene may be found in variants of Tsar Maksimilian and The Ship, affecting, in the former, the Tsar himself or more frequently the knights vanquished by his champion Anika, and in the latter some member of the robber band or the old drunkard Preklonskii whom they capture. Death and resurrection may also be found in The Throne (an amalgam of Tsar Maksimilian and the vertep drama of King Herod). The characters are brought back to life by a variety of means, the sprinkling of water or some 'magic' potion, by holding smelling salts under their noses, by lifting by the shoulders and giving them a good shake. In one version of Tsar Maksimilian the</page><page sequence="9">174 ELIZABETH A. WARNER gravedigger (not the doctor) hits Anika, the slain royal champion, over the head with a cudgel, and he runs off accompanied by cries of 'He's risen from the dead! He's risen from the dead!'36 Resurrection from the dead, as in the folk tales, is equated with waking from sleep. The revived stretch, yawn and exclaim how well they have slept. In this article I have tried to show some of the complexity of the charlatan Doctor figure and the variety of sources from which he is drawn. He has become virtually an institution in the popular theatre, one of the few characters of the folk theatre to have survived to the present day. 'Doctor and patient' scenes are still occasionally performed by Christmas mummers and by the more rowdy wedding guests in country districts, whereas the plays from which they emerged were more or less extinct before the last war. The quack Doctor changes with times and circumstances, abandoning his frock coat and top hat, so to speak, for a white clinical overall. Although in 19th-century Russia and in our own century he may have retained his foreign nationality as a convention, it is clear that his actual function is no longer to simply expose the shortcomings of ill- trained foreign medical charlatans but to point an accusing finger at the inadequacies of Russia's own medical standards. Army doctors in particular found themselves parodied in the folk plays, like the 'Kazan' military chemist' from The Play of Ermak, recorded in 1948 near the town of Kirov, a variant which belongs to the theatrical tradition of the Cossack regiments in that area.37 More striking are Aksakov's comments on the military version of Tsar Maksimilian which he described in 1855. The barely disguised derogatory remarks of the soldier actors about their military hospital and the treatment they received there led him to suggest that the subject was 'no foreign doctor, no Italian but a contemporary Russian public servant.'"3 The secret of the quack's success is undoubtedly his ability to adapt and to entertain in a variety of ways to suit the mood of his audience. At one extreme he may be the channel for political, social and national discontent, and at the other no more than a simple pantomime illusionist who operates on the fool, who has swallowed a whole egg, and pulls forth a live duck."3 Department of Russian Studies, University of Hull.
