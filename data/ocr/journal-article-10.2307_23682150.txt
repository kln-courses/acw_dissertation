<plain_text><page sequence="1">Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae, TomusXXIX (l),pp.l — 6 (1975) A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF SHUI HU CHUAN AND HSI YII CHI THE BOUNDS OF THE CLASSIC CHINESE NOVEL BY Β. CSONGOR The novels Water Margin and Journey to the West apparently show some parallel features. Both Sung Chiang and Sun Wu-k'ung succeeded in establish ing independent states by armed force, both of them appeared to an outside superior power as threatening dangers, both of them were invincible or indest ructible — but finally both had to surrender and to pursue their bellicose activi ties in the service of their former adversaries. The leading characters are des cribed in both novels as being of supernatural origin — and the second part of both is definitely anticlimactic. There are some obvious différences also to be found. The Liangshan story is set against a background commonly accepted as historical, the romance of Monkey is a product of sheer fantasy. Sung Chiang had a host of friends and allies around him, Sun Wu-k'ung's struggles were practically always one-man fights. Sung Chiang is described as being essentially a passive character, while Sun Wu-k'ung is presented as being frantically active up to the last. Sung Chiang and his men were endowed with a mandate from Heaven, and they surrendered at the first propitious occasion offered, while Monkey fought on blindly, defying the whole realm of Heaven only to satisfy his innate and boundless ambitions, until tamed by force. Both novels, on account of their historical (or, in the case of Hsi yu chi pseudo-historical) setting seem to be related to the epic genre in Yüan-Ming times commonly called historical romances.1 The development of the epic genre — of novels in particular — shows a marked upward trend in Chinese literature from Sung-time on ward. From oral taies it developed into written novels of considérable length and of tremenduous popularity. Most of these novels, lacked composition, they were at best sériés of adventurous stories loosely strung together. The only principle of composi tion available at the early stage of development was to follow a historical se quence of events, in full-length novels historical thèmes were dominant.

CSONGOR remarkable at the same time that among historical thèmes topics like the story of the Three Kingdoms and of the Five Dynasties prevailed even at the begin ning.2 Generally speaking, the majority of historical romances preferred to narrate the décliné and fall of a dynasty and the rise of a new power.3 The reasons for this preference may have been multiple. The permanent division of China under the Sung into the powerful, menacing, barbarian North and the menaced but prosperous, highly civilized South, with ail the exodus of Northern mandarins and literati following the legitimate dynasty, the bar barian domination that extended ail over China during the Mongols, — these expériences certainly tended to arouse interest in past âges of similar constel lation, when the bellicose element was prédominant in public life, and the fate of China depended on the valorous resoluteness of martial characters emerging out of the common people mostly. This obviously nurtured the feeling of im portance among members of the military, who generally wereallotted a subaltern position under the civilian mandarins. Moreover, these thèmes obviously ap pealed to both the authors and the général public by their adventurous nature. The most important aspect seems to be, nevertheless, that these intervais between two dynasties were indeed those épisodes in Chinese history during which the basically rigid hierarchy of society feil apart, the hitherto closed society became an open one overnight for many people, and social mobility gained an unprecedented momentum. It was precisely in these times that the rare possibility was offered to commoners and soldiers to make füll use of their personal qualities for climbing higher, sometimes to the top of the social hierar chy by becoming générais, statesmen — and, eventually, even emperors. In other words, founding an imperial dynasty, or at least actively participating in the consolidation of its power, was considered in traditional thought as the greatest achievement in public life, a wellnigh superhuman feat. A historical subject, however, was inevitably bound in China by traditio nal interprétations, even in literature. There always existed an officiai interpré tation of the past, and although subject to change from time to time, at a given epoch it was obligatory to follow the current version. Authors of literary works were not supposed to meddle with,unless in insignificant détail ; artistic creative ness was at most tolerated in this respect. Moreover, the characters of leading historié personages always underwent a ritualistic stereotypisation in histori cal thought: in theory, the heavenly mandate for establishing a new dynasty could but be allotted to a person with definite moral traits, and among these characteristics courage, cleverness and self-reliance — important and indispens able requisites in waging wars — played a minor rôle in traditional Chinese political thought. 2 Cf.孟元老 Meng Yuan-lao,東京夢華錄 Tung ching meng hua lu，ch. 10 on Sung story-tellers. 3 Cf.

XXIX, 1975</page><page sequence="3">SHUI HU CHUAN AND HSI YU CHI In the long run, these ritualistic preconceptions were incompatible with artistic creativeness. The more open style of developing urban life became gra dually estranged from these patriarchal archétypes, and the emergent epic literature being a product of this urban development itself, wanted to describe the heroes of the past in more anthropomorphic terms — the more so as urban life (and its économie basis, the thriving commercial activity) opened new, by Confucian standards, unconventional ways to career for ambitious and talented people. One of the earliest examples of this reinterpretation may be found in the T'ang ch'uan ch'i 虫L臂客傳 CKiu jan k'o chuan (The story of the dragon· bearded stranger) by 杜光庭 Tu Kuang-t'ing. This gives a fictitious story of the career of 李靖 Li Ching, a T'ang général during the décliné of the Sui dynasty. Still as a commoner, Li Ching cornes across a mysterious stranger nicknamed Dragon-beard. Dragon-beard has a humble appearance, but it turns out that he owns immense riches. He predicts the future of Li Ching and offers him his wealth so that he may support Li Shih-min, the emperor to come. Dragon-beard wanted to become emperor himself (it was for this reason that he amassed his wealth), but once having met Li Shih-min he recognized him to be the future emperor by his appearance, and changed his plans into going abroad and making himself king in a foreign country, — in which he succeeded. Now, this conflict between Dragon-beard and Li Shih-min obviously reflects the conflict between old and new ideas as to the qualification of a future emperor: poorly dressed but rich Dragon-beard is obviously a merchant whose social status should have prevented him from entertaining such high aspira lions according orthodox standards — but he has to give way to the charismatic personality of the predestined emperor (the personal qualities of whom are not even specified). The conflict is solved by a compromise: both outstanding per sons (there is no word in the novel about the ambitions of Li Shih-min; his prédestination was established by a Taoist priest, friend to Dragon-beard) become sovereigns, but in différent countries.4 It is shown by the example cited. above that, as major historié personali ties could not be fictionalized for expressing these new ideas, personages of minor historical importance had to been utilized or even fictitious characters created. Chinese historical romances may then be described also as life-stories of outstanding men, i.e. career-stories, of a slightly unorthodox character. They appealed to people who had never had the opportunity or were disillusioned to embark on a career generally accepted, i.e. to become mandarins through 4 Cf.唐人小說 Tfang jen hsiao-shuo (éd. by 汪辟疆 Wang P'i-ch'iang), Shanghai 1957. The story must have been immensely popular judging by its after-life, especially in dramatic adaptations (cf. op. cit.). It is not without interest to note that the author, Tu Kuang-t'ing was a devoted Taoist. I* Acta Orient. Hung. XXIX, 1975</page><page sequence="4">Β. CSONGOU state examinations. The novels Shui hu chuan and Hsi yu chi are certainly such career-stories. They made use of the artistic properties of historical romances, they were in some ways even restricted by its traditions, but the governing ideas embodied in them expressed a more consistent outlook on the course of these unorthodox careers than any of the other novels did. The heroes of both novels are of supernatural origin. This certainly was a means to keep reality and fiction apart. The human possibilities offered in the plot were regarded at most as potentialities, they could not be turned into reality by everybody. The degree of their supernaturalness is, however, différ ent: the heroes of Liang-shan are said to be incarnations of star-goods banished from Heaven and sent to Earth in order to fulfil a heavenly mission — but their acts show nothing supernatural except for being people of extraordinary talents. Sun Wu-k'ung, on the other hand, is not only begotten by mysterious forces, he acquires real supernatural powers — but seems to be more actively human in his assiduous efforts to satisfy his ambitions. This différence in their relation to reality seems to be in close connection with their différence in cha racter, i.e. with the passive behaviour of Sung Chiang and with the frantic activity of Sun Wu-k'ung. Sung Chiang is rather a charismatic personality: there is no need to prove his fitness for leadership by heroic feats. In personal behaviour he seems to have more in common with Hsüan-tsang than with Sun Wu-k'ung. Bravery and skill in handling their arms are essential features of the Liangshan heroes. The same is told about Sung Chiang, but there is not a single case in the novel where he actually exhibits such traits. In making wars, it is always one of his counsellors whose advice assures to victory rather than his own décision. Not unlike Confucian model rulers, he possesses a single distinctive trait: he has «virtue», he attracts worthy people and is able to use them. He is moderate in his aims: he only wants to prove his worthiness by invincible résistance, and after having surrendered on terms stipulated by him, he only wants to serve his emperor, though better than incompétent and corrupt mandarins. The monkey Sun Wu-k'ung has no heavenly mission, only a boundless and indomitable ambition. A rare instance in classic Chinese novels, he has an active personality. Becoming king of the apes by his own merit, he studies and attains the art of immortality, acquires a magie weapon (in fact, an universal tool) for himself, and grows into a dreaded adversary of the realm of Heaven. The shaping of his character was certainly influenced by the dim awareness of the infinite potentialities latent in human nature. This récognition, though, could have been conceived in a fragmentary and distorted way only: Sun Wu-k'ung is not human, he is only a monkey, and by this device ail his efforts and aims are exposed to ridicule as being vainglorious, petty skirmishes. His struggles are fought not in the real world, but in one enlarged into otherworldly dimensions. Acta Orient. Hung. XXIX, 1975</page><page sequence="5">SHUI HU CHUAN AND HSI YU CHI It is exactly these dimensions, juxtaposed to the mundane world that lend a deeper meaning to his struggles. It is not only the futile strivings of man towards glory and power that are ridiculed, but also the very world that frustrâtes his ambition. The greater half of the Hsi yu chi, narrating the jour ney of Hsüan-tsang, is constructed on the basis of a recurring scheme as follows: Hsüan-tsang and his disciples are attacked by a démon who wants to devour the holy man through which he (or she) hopes to obtain immortality. Ail démons are defeated, but it happens very rarely that Sun Wu-k'ung, invincible and clever as he is, could destroy the démon single-handed. Victory is mostly achieved only when Monkey succeeds in ascertaining the status of the démon in the heavenly hierarchy. This happens mostly by asking some of his friends and acquaintances in the heavenly offices; sometimes they even have to look up after the respective démon in the heavenly officiai registers. Then it turns out that the démon belongs under the authority of some celestial mandarin, but deserted his place. With the appearance of his master the démon cannot but return to his temporarily neglected duties. This scheme reflects pretty well some basic features of traditional Chinese society. The hiérarchie bureaucracy is all-embracing, it rules both heaven and earth.5 This ambitious administration wants to regulato everything. It is a recurring motive in the novel that although for Hsüan-tsang the journey to the West seems to be a rather venturesome and angerous enterprise, for the heavenly authorities it is a run-of-the-mill affair, planned in advance to the minutest détails. The scheme described above reflects the historié fact that despite ail the efforts of heavenly (and earthly) mandarins to put everything always into order, mandarin bureaucracy inevitably and continuously begets its antagonistic, but inséparable complementary counterpart — anarchy. One may find law and order looking at the System from above, but at the bottom chaos and wantonness ravage at will. Single injustices can be straightened out by appealing to the superior authorities of the culprit only, as the vertical ties of the system are far more tight than the horizontal ones.6 This imperfect, but doggedly persevering and self-reproducing bureau cratie order does not leave any alternative for his adversaries in public life. 5 We may recall that in imperial China even the canonization of the gods carne under the Jurisdiction of the emperor. 6 It must be remembered at this point that traditional China consisted of a number of isolated (rural) communities that were held together only from above by the mandarin administration. Cf. e.g. E. Balazs, La bureaucratie céleste, Paris 1968, p. 20.: « . . .une grande société agraire dont les cellules, les familles paysannes vivant disséminées sur la base d'une autarcie économique individuelle, couvrent un immense territoire continental, sans articulations naturelles, et qui se désagrégeraient dans une anarchie irrémédiable sans un cadre solide d'administrateurs hiérarchisés, munis d'un pouvoir discrétionnaire que leur confère un gouvernement central.» (Les aspects significatifs de la société chinoise.)

They are champions of wish-dreams, emerging out of glimmering, but not realizable social tendencies. In the final analysis their basis of liveli hood is identical with that of their hated adversaries and they are unable to change social order: the Liangshan heroes live on the food robbed from state granaries in the same way as officiais do, and anarchie Sun Wu-k'ung wants only to replace the Jade Emperor on his throne. Their futile but noble efforts cannot transcend the boundaries set by the paralyzing spell of the Asian world — the palm of Buddha, and they are fated to become gods — immobile idols. These heroes do not really challenge destiny, they are moving along paths predetermined for them by superior powers. They are unable to change the course of events, things only happen to them. The factors governing public life were to remain basically unchanged, soldiers, merchants, vagabonds had to become assimilated to the existing order if they wanted to climb higher on the social ladder. This conformism barred the way to artistic descriptions of careers in public life. The composition had to stay at the level of picaresque genre. The really great products of Chinese epic literature had therefore to turn inward — they were born out of the descriptions of private life. Acta Orient. Hang. XXIX, 1975</page></plain_text>
