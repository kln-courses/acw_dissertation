<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kant's Philosophy of Science: The Transition From MetapiFysics To Science Robert E. Butts The University of Western Ontario 1. Historical Stagesetting For many of us nurtured in idealist ways inclining us to unwavering acceptance of Kantian principles, 1951 was a bad year. We read in Reich- enbach's The Rise of Scientific Philosophy of the "disintegration of the synthetic a priori". l Kant had taught us that there are very general principles--each one connected to a primal category of thought--that are necessary in the formation of mathematics and physics and are express- ible in nonanalytic propositions. However, since Kant's death in 1804 both mathematics and physics have developed revolutionary traits: non- euclidian geometries, new developments in symbolic logic, relativity physics, and finally, quantum mechanics, sealed the negative fate of Kant's high principles. Henceforth we must accept that there are no non- empty claims about reality that can be counted as necessary or indispen- sable to mathematics and science. Kant's attempt to offer a new episte- mological guarantee of the three-dimensionality of space, and of the Newtonian character of physical motions, thus failed in the deepest sense: As a philosophy of science it turned out to be an anthropomorphic curiosity. Kant's epistemic formalism might well apply to macroscopic objects undergoing macroscopic movements and observed within the appar- ent three-dimensional limits of our human visual space. It fails to ap- ply in any other domains. Kant's objects of possible experience are ob- jects too limited for purposes of recent mathematics and physics. Some proponents of positivism and logical empiricism strengthened this disintegration or dissolution of the synthetic a priori, of the central need of the Kantian system. The reigning orthodoxy in philosophy of science had no further interest in Kant's failed programme. But some of us crawled on through the dark corridors of Kant exegesis to the beat of different philosophical rhythms. We remembered C. I. Lewis' (1929) masterwork and its argument for a functional a priori, for acceptance of conceptual forms on pragmatic grounds. We remembered Arthur Pap's (1946) application of this theory to a new reconstruction of the relationship of Kant to Newton, one based on taking all Kantian synthetic a prioris to have only regulative employments. In Korner (1955, pp. 103-104) a similar view is expressed in his suggestion that Kant's synthetic a pri- ori judgements can be construed (along lines adumbrated by Kant himself) PSA 1984, Volume 2, pp. 685-705 Copyright ? 1985 by the Philosophy of Science Association</page><page sequence="2">686 as rules or imperatives for construction of sciences of a certain kind. 2 For some earlier interpreters, like Cassirer, revisions in reading Kant stemmed from taking seriously for the first time the relationship be- tween the Critique of Judgement and the first Critique (See Cassirer 1921). Leanings in the direction of the imperativistic interpretation are to be found in Beck (1960, pp. 191-194) and later in Beck (1981, pp. 458-459). Butts (1984) is a sustained argument for this interpretation. These shifts in interpretation of Kant were paralleled by the appear- ance of the first detailed attempts to study his philosophy of science since Adickes (1924): Vuillemin (1955), Plaass (1960). However, for most of us who had taken a continuing interest in Kant as a philosopher of science, Buchdahl's (1969 and many related essays) set the stage for a really thorough investigation of the whole range of Kant's scientific interests, and for a determined attempt to fix the limits of his philos- ophy of science against the backdrop of his critique of traditional met- aphysics. Interpretations of Kant's views on science are now appearing regular- ly; but some authors lose sight of the fact that there are central parts of his programme that any interpretation must accommodate. Attempts to understand his views on the philosophical status of science--the very same is true of attempts to understand his views on the philosophical status of morality, art, or anything else--are constrained by at least the following large parts of Kant's programme, parts that cannot be in- terpreted away without losing complete sight of Kant, without coming to see ghosts, creatures much feared by Kantians. 2. Central Tenets of Kant's Programme I take it that one is not studying Kant unless he takes Kant to have believed at least the following propositions to be systematically sacro- sanct: 1) Knowledge has a dual source in sensibility and understanding: To know is to conceptualize sense-contentful intuitions of objects in space and time under the categories. 2) That which we know about space and time, the categories, pure sche- mata or rules of meaning, mathematical constructions, and pure princi- ples instancing the categories, is what we can know a priori in the do- main of the theoretical: We can know a priori of things only what we ourselves put into them." (Bxviii). 3) Objects of possible experience (knowables) are just those objects structured by the schematized categories; "experience" is categorially idealized sense-contentful intuition. 4) Concepts natively apply only to evident sense-contents (or to con- structs, in the case of mathematics); thus no conceptualization of that which transcends the realm of possible experience (the phenomenal) is possible. 5) Ideas are sense-contentless forms having application in logic (in thinking, not in knowing); ideas do not present objects of possible ex- perience (knowables). 6) Traditional metaphysics separates ideas from the dual sources of knowledge, relying solely upon appeal to logical possibility; it follows that there can be no metaphysical knowledge that derives from ideas-- there can be no knowledge of an sich reality; no a priori knowledge of</page><page sequence="3">687 things as they are in themselves. 7) Metaphysical ideas thus have a merely regulative employment; they guide research and condition systematic expectations; their proper em- ployment encourages us to stay within the bounds of possible experi- ence--in effect, to settle for the kind of knowledge that positive sci- ence yields. Perhaps many of us could accept a programme as general as this one, as Einstein seems to have encouraged Reichenbach to do in the exchange in the Einstein Schilpp volume. Difficulties emerge when we try to apply this general system to the specifics of Newtonian (or any other) sci- ence. The problems stem from the fact that in addition to these seven general theses, Kant also wants us to accept that a fair number of non- analytic propositions are true a priori; for example: a) Space is 3-dimensional (as a "fact" about spatiality). b) All intuitions are extensive magnitudes. c) All events are Second Analogy causally related. d) With regard to all changes of corporeal nature, the quanti- ty of matter taken as a whole remains the same, unincreased and undiminished. e) Every change of matter has an external cause. However troubling it may be to us now to accept these more specific synthetic a prioris, no serious student of Kant can deny that he accord- ed them such a status. a) is something we know a priori about our space; it is evident from our inability to construct in a priori intuition any features of a space that is not 3-dimensional. b) and c) are strong syn- thetic a priori principles of the Transcendental Analytic; b) tells us how all objects. of possible experience must be "constituted". c) tells us that whenever something dynamically comes into being or passes out of being, the event structure of its existential modalities can be expli- cated causally. Thus a), b), and c) are proper parts of Kant's a priori epistemic formalism. What about d) and e)? These are what Kant refers to in MAN (abbreviating Die Aletaphysische Anfangsgriinde der Naturwissen- schaften) as the first and second laws of mechanics. If these are known because of what we ourselves put into the concept of matter, it begins to look as if a priority intrudes into that which looks more and more empirical as we go. Unhappily, there is more to consider. Look at these: f) Matter is the movable in space. g) Matter is the movable insofar as it fills a space. h) Matter is the movable insofar as it is has as such a moving force. i) Matter is the movable insofar as it can as such be an object of experience. j) If no (unbalanced) external forces act upon a body, it will continue in its state of rest or motion with uniform velocity in a straight line. k) F=ma. f)-i) are the definitions of matter introduced in Kant's treatments of, respectively, phoronomy (kinematics), dynamics, mechanics, phenomenolo- gy, in MAN. j) and k) are Newton s first and second laws of motion. No-</page><page sequence="4">688 tice that it would be quite possible to hold (as do Vuillemin and Plaass) that f)-i) are pure a prioris on a par with principles of the understanding b) and c), and to argue that both Kant's d) and e) and Newton's j) and k) are empirical propositions, requiring appeal to em- pirical data for substantiation. 3. Relating the Epistemic Formalism to Science Theses 1-7 above oversimply summarize the general features of Kant's epistemology. A conceptual system is entailed by this epistemology, one having as essential elements the a priori forms of sensuous intuition, or space and time, the categories, and general semantical rules of ap- plication called schemata. The a priori conditions of knowing apply only to sense-contentful intuitions (1-7 are supposed to guarantee this). But what, exactly, is the relationship between this epistemic formalism and observational and experimental science? Late in his life Kant will begin to write about the transition from metaphysics to physics; in what does that transition consist? Kant refers to the principles of the formalism as necessary laws of nature, and as specifying a general "metaphysics" (where, of course, by "metaphysics" Kant now means those and only those principles that can be genuinely known a priori: his epistemology re- veals these "metaphysical" principles). The four definitions of matter in MAN are principles of a "special metaphysics"; namely, the metaphys- ics of external objects, or of objects empirically discovered to be mov- ing in space, and empirically discovered to be subject to forces of ac- tion and interaction. The special metaphysics, in other words, is an ap- plication of the general metaphysics to matter.4 What needs to be shown, Kant tells us, is how category-dependent concepts of matter yield ob- jects of possible experience, how the science of matter can be objec- tive. Since the specific empirical claims about material objects are re- quired to be mathematical in form, we are further required to construct a priori in intuition the idealized cases to which the special metaphys- ics will apply. Otherwise, given the epistemology of 1-7 there could be no objective content to the applied special metaphysics. In order to highlight the issues, let us limit ourselves to discus- sion of Kant's treatment of mechanics. Mechanics takes its start from the principle: M: Matter is the movable insofar as it has as such a moving force (p. 536) If we give Kant his two oft insisted upon claims that both motion and force are discovered empirically (motion as simple observation of change of position of an object over time, and force as felt resistance), then M can be taken as a definition (Erkidrung; see KRV, A728-730/B755-758) of matter in Kant's technical sense. In mathematics, the only discipline in which there are, properly speaking, definitions, concepts are made; that is, constructed a priori. The trick is to show how ordinary experi- ences of motion and felt resistance can be rendered objective; and this, for Kant, now means, mathematized. The tools required for analysis of motion will not be (to use one of Kant's favourite phrases) "borrowed from" experience. The special metaphysics introduced by taking matter in motion to be an instance of the schematized categories must instead "borrow from" general metaphysics. Indeed, the very lawlikeness of mech- anical principles will depend upon the strong lawlikeness conditions</page><page sequence="5">689 laid down by the categories. 4. A Digression: Points about Lawlikeness The space/time, schematized category structures yielded by 1-7 (call this conceptual system SC) produce a concept of Nature (capital "N"): "Nature is the existence of things, so far as it is determined according to universal laws" (Prolegomena, p. 294). The universal laws are the synthetic a priori pure laws of the understanding corresponding to each category. But there is also nature (lower case "n") as "the complex of all objects of experience" (Prolegomena, p. 295); in other words, as the set of idealized constructs made possible by application of SC. If na- ture [n], or some subset of [n] is going to turn out to be lawlike, it will have to achieve this by virtue of some relationship to nature [N]. If regularly associated units of observation are to be law candidates, the warrant cannot be empirical, but must come from what Kant calls the I'affinity" between items sensed in the realm of appearance, and items thought in the domain of understanding. That Kant's concept of affinity is crucial to his theory of the linkage between SC and Newton's physics has been noted by some commentators, but none have offered the required explication. I hope to do so below. 5. Return to the Question of Moving from the A priori to the Empirical If the definitionally a priori M is to be applicable, it must render possible analysis of moving forces in mathematical terms. In brief, what is at issue is that in mechanics physical objects enter into and pass out of various determinate states in space in accordance with quantities of impressed force. Kant has an a priori machinery for dealing with changes in modalities of existence: the analogies. The regulative sig- nificance of M begins to emerge when the following instantiating moves are made: Al: In all changes of appearances substance is permanent; its quantum in nature is neither increased nor diminished. (First Analogy) Ml: With regard to all changes of corporeal nature, the quantity of matter taken as a whole remains the same, unincreased and undiminished. (Kant's first law of mechanics) A2: All alterations take place in conformity with the law of the connection of cause and effect. (Second Analogy) M2: Every change of matter has an external cause. (Every body remains in its state of rest or motion in the same direction and with the same velocity unless it is compelled by an ex- ternal cause to forsake this state.) (Kant's second law of mechanics) A3: All substances, in so far as they can be perceived to co- exist in space, are in thoroughgoing reciprocity. (Third Analogy) M3: In all communication of motion, action and reaction are always equal to one another. (Kant's third law of mechanics) Kant's arguments for the correctness of these instantiations are quite straightforward. Universal metaphysics proclaims that anything that is genuinely substantial in appearance cannot be increased or di-</page><page sequence="6">690 minished in quantity. Here it is matter as substance that is at issue; therefore Ml instances Al, and shares its synthetic a priori character. M2 instances A2 (and shares its synthetic a priori character) because changes in physical state, like all changes, are caused, and the only causes available to us in observation of external objects are external causes. The argument for M3 as an instance of A3 is a little less direct and uncomplicated, but it is clear that Kant wants all cases of motion of objects in space to be represented as reciprocal, and if this is so, then again M3 will share the synthetic a priori character of A3. So far, we have the following structure: M: the mechanical definition of matter explicated as follows: Al, A2, A3 as principles of SC (general metaphysics=laws of Nature [N]) Ml, M2, M3 as instances of Al, A2, and A3 (special metaphysics=cases of laws of Nature [N]=laws of mechanics) This articulated a priori structure is to apply to (form and inform) empirical instances in a second sense of 'empirical' (one quite differ- ent from 'empirical' in the clainis that motion and force are discovered empirically). I noted above that Kant's claim that notion and force can only be discovered empirically appeals to a very ordinary sense of "em- pirical" referring to my experience of objects changing position in time, and to my experience of felt resistance. On the other hand, the "empirical" instances of a priori principles of pure physics are contin- gent descriptions of frequently noted regularities of certain sorts; they are what came to be known as phenomenal laws. SC+LM (a priori laws of mechanics) must somehow relate to empirical content in this sense if it is to be seen to form and inform a physical science. Such empirical content generalizations are thus the phenomena to be saved. Kant tells us (MAN p. 544) that the possibility of natural science (physics) rests entirely on Ml and M2 (Kant's statement of the law of inertia). One would suppose that this natural science would at some level possess rel- atively clear cases of empirical descriptions, and that these descrip- tions would serve as the content formed by SC+LM. Kant makes it clear that what is to issue from application of SC+LM is a justification of the lawlikeness of the Newtonian phenomena (Kepler's purely descriptive laws of planetary motion (KLs); Galileo's acceleration rate law (GL)) and the law of universal gravitation (LUG). What we would like to have (and what Buchdahl repeatedly reminds us Kant does not intend to give us) is a deductive structure in which in- ferential moves from SC through LM to the descriptions of the phenomena and universal gravitation are perspicuously valid. However, if the com- bined propositional resources of SC and LM are deductively to entail KLs, GL, LUG, then the structure SC+LM must itself have empirical con- tent, and this is exactly what a structure of synthetic a priori princi- ples cannot have. It may seem paradoxical to suggest that Kant thought so outrageous a thought, but it seems to me that he held in all serious- ness the view that SC and LM have no empirical consequences, in the strict sense of not deductively entailing any specific observational consequences. This being so, it does not follow, as Buchdahl wants us to believe, that the connection between SC, LM and the empirical descrip- tions involves a "looseness of fit" that permits SC to survive all changes in the foundations of sciences like physics. SC may be program- matic and "hard core" in some restricted sense for Kant, but given his insistence in MAN that LM laws do instance SC and that no other LM laws</page><page sequence="7">691 are conceivable (constructible), it seems to me to be unwise to attri- bute to Kant's philosophy of science the extremely generous looseness Buchdahl insists upon. Before proceeding to discuss what I take the con- nection between SC+LM and the descriptive laws to be, let me make some further brief remarks on Buchdahl's interpretive programme. 6. Additional Thoughts about the "Looseness of Fit" Interpretation In the paper he delivered at the 7th International Congress of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science in Salzburg, Austria (July 12, 1983), Buchdahl seems to me to have so complicated and loaded the "looseness of fit" interpretation that it simply sinks under its own weight. 6 In a figure that accompanied his paper, Buchdahl sketched the "methodological components of scientific theory", and he suggested in discussion that complete mastery of the diagram will give all that Kant's philosophy of science yields, and will show that no arguments exist in Kant that link the components. Buchdahl's reading now commits Kant to three "ontologies" and to such a host of general and special rules as to make almost any alterations in the substructures falling under SC justifiable, even to the point of receiving a Kantian transcen- dental justification of developments in alternative geometries and quan- tum physics. The typescript contains this extraordinary passage (pp. 23-24): However, this 'looseness of fit' which surrounds the rela- tions between the phenomenological and the ontological aspects of [the probative, explicative and systemic components of a Kantian scientific theory], and indeed, between these three com- ponents themselves, has the advantage of not bringing the cen- tral themes of Kantian transcendentalism crashing down every time there is a change in the paradigms of natural science. Lack of appreciation of the 'looseness' has led most Kant scholars-- we need only think of the case of Reichenbach--to the opposite conclusion. Against this, Kant's transcendental approach, in its application to both the ontology and the phenomenology of theory construction, turns out to be something much more informal, much more subtly and messily articulated, more tentative and general, than the usual, more formal, elucidations of the so-called 'transcendental argument' would lead us to expect. Evidently it is not so much a matter here of any formal deductions, or of the demonstration of the uniqueness and necessity of this or that 'a priori' condition; still less...should Kant be saddled with the absurdity of having wanted to prove the 'a priori certainty', of, for instance, Newtonian mechanics; after all, he did say, in CpR (A480/B508), that "in natural science.. .there is endless conjecture, and certainty is [here] not to be counted upon. 7 I applaud, and have tried to stress in (1984), the implications for a partially pragmatic reading of Kant's intentions at one level (teleolog- ical judgement) that Buchdahl's stated position yields. But surely Buch- dahl has gone too far. We have already seen that there is a close fit between what I have been calling SC and LM, and I will develop other as- pects of close fit below. Furthermore, although we may not prefer a Kant who limited his view to the sciences and the philosophical resources of his day, I am bound by historical candor to have to say that Buchdahl is mostly wrong in what he says in this passage, one that I take it summar-</page><page sequence="8">692 izes his position as of the date of the Salzburg Congress. There are two sources of error, each one important in its revelation of truths about Kant's philosophy of science. Before identifying what I take these errors to be, I will partially concede an important related point. I think the best argument for the "looseness of fit" interpretation is given in Buchdahl (1969, p. 657ff). Here it is suggested that Kant needs an argument for the credentials of science that is not fully binding because he needs room to move from man as observer to man as actor. The resolution of the second and third an- tinomies of the first Critique, and of the antinomy of the third Cri- tique, and Kant's requirement of freedom in morality, all become suspect if the links in the chain between transcendental epistemology and any particular empirical scientific programme are twisted too tightly. How- ever, I should point out that I do not think the tensions Buchdahl al- ludes to require his "looseness of fit" moves. In (1984, Ch. IX), I pro- duce a complex exegetical argument starting from the fact that the third Critique antinomy is resolved by showing that requirements of both niech- anism and teleology are regulative, rather than constitutive of nature. I then apply this admission to Kant's resolution of the fourth antinomy (there is a necessary being/there is no necessary being), one again based on appeal to antinomial differences as regulative. Finally, I ar- gue that the resolution of the third antinomy (freedom/determinism) is itself a case of the resolution of the fourth, so that ground is already prepared for the resolution of the third Critique antinomy in Kant's resolutions of the third and fourth antinomies in the first Critique. The point is that all three antinomies are resolved by reformulating what look like substantive epistemic clashes between propositions as methodological clashes between arguments for adopting or rejecting rules. If these moves are correct, then Kant's attempt to validate New- tonian physics at the level of special metaphysics in no way threatens his full philosophical programme. The problem of how tight or loose is the fit between transcendental principles and pure principles of physics (and empirical science), is thus an irrelevant question once we see that for Kant it is all a matter of formulating the arguments for recommend- ing adoption of these rules (SC rules) for constituting possible objects of experience, rather than others. And those arguments have entirely to do with elimination of the case for classical rational metaphysics; in short, with elimination of appeals to logical possibility as the test of truth, and replacement with appeals to what can in principle be empiri- cally or mathematically instanced in ways that human observers can be said to understand. To return to what I take the revealing errors to be, note first that Buchdahl's position fails to locate what for Kant can be the only "on- tology", and it is an ontology of physical objects, of bodies empirical- ly ascertained to be in motion in three-dimensional space. This is stated clearly in Critique of Judgement (pp. 181-182), although it had already been established as a stable consequence of the programme in KRV. At the cited place, Kant distinguishes between transcendental prin- ciples as principles representing a priori the universal conditions un- der which objects can be cognized by us, and metaphysical principles, or principles representing a priori the conditions under which objects whose concepts are given empirically "may be further determined a pri- ori" (emphasis supplied). Thus he states that we can hold as true tran- scendentally that all bodies as substances change always for cause; but</page><page sequence="9">693 it is a metaphysical principle that such causes are always external. Now--and this is crucially important--in the former case, bodies are thought only through what Kant calls "ontological predicates" (and he states that these are the pure concepts of the understanding=the cate- gories); in the second, or metaphysical, case, the concept of a movable thing in space is introduced. However, once this fuller concept of body is on the scene, "it may be seen quite a priori that the latter predi- cate (movement only by means of an external cause) applies to body". I have sketched above the relationship between the pure concept (Second Analogy causality) and the principle of inertia. In the fullest sense to be found in the writings of Kant, both the transcendental and the meta- physical principles are synthetic a priori. Still, it may seem gratuitous thus to suggest that Kant's transcen- dental ontology is limited to what we can know a priori of bodies. What of the soul? I have no space to repeat here my account of Kant's rejec- tion of any ontological status for the soul (see Chapter V in 1984). Perhaps it will suffice if I refer to his statement in MAN (pp. 542-543) that because the thought "I" is not a concept at all, but an inner per- ception, we cannot classify the thought of the soul as a substance, and hence not as permanent. Kant's point is clear: "Substance is possible only in space and according to the conditions of space, and hence is possible only as object of the external senses". Like it or not, the values of the ontological variables in Kant's transcendental system can only have bodies moving in space as instances. And if the forms of SC are ontological predicates, and LM laws are cases of SC principles, then I do not see how we can with reason argue that SC and LM fail to share the same ontology.8 And when the ontological predicates native to SC+LM are fully articulated, as Kant tries to do in MAN, it is equally diffi- cult to see that the fit is as thoroughly loose as Buchdahl wishes. This is not to argue that Kant's foundations for physics are sturdy charac- ters that will always stand up, but it certainly does sustain the truism that Kant thought physics has foundations, and that these must be sys- tematically and ontologically beholden to general metaphysics or tran- scendental epistemology. 7. Return to the Question of Relating Foundations to Empirical Science That which motivates Buchdahl's second mistake--now formulated as a misreading of what follows from failure of deductive connections to hold between statements containing ontological predicates and those contain- ing empirical ones--is his inclination to think that the sentences mak- ing up the parts of the Kantian programme for physics are all of the same logical type. Kant is of course himself responsible for a certain amount of misunderstanding resulting from his talk about propositions as judgements. If we translate 'judgement' as the more manageable 'proposi- tion', and then think that Kant's system is a nest of deductively ar- ranged propositions running from the pure principles of the understand- ing, through the a priori laws of pure physics, down to the empirical laws that are descriptions of noted regularities, we are bound to have problems. As I suggested above, we cannot obtain this deductive nesting unless the pure principles become impure. So Buchdahl is right about there being no clear deductive road from SC to empirical physics. But instead of concluding at this point that looseness of fit is the order of the day, he ought to have latched onto the second way in which Kant talks about concepts and principles; namely, as rules. This would have</page><page sequence="10">694 led him to a correct account of the relationship between SC+LM and the empirical laws of physics, and to appreciation of the further point that it is not deductive connection, but affinity, that Kant places at the center of his account of the relationship between formal rules and em- pirical descriptions. I will now develop each of these points in turn. I suggested in the opening section of this paper that what we might call the dreaded Reichenbach threat can be countered by appeal to some other resources supplied by his fellow positivists. Schlick and Mach both began to think of the various sentences used to formulate scientif- ic laws as being of different logical types, and Pap explicitly proposed that we distinguish between regulative principles employed to develop systems of various kinds, and the descriptive sentences formed by appli- cation of the rules. I mentioned that a similar view was expressed by Korner. I propose now to outline what Kant's philosophy of physics looks like if we take this imperativist line (one that underwrites my inter- pretation of Kant's philosophy of science in my 1984). We have seen the following structure articulated by Kant (limiting ourselves again to discussion of mechanics): SKETCH I LEVEL I: M LEVEL II: Al, A2, A3 LEVEL III: Ml, M2, M3 LEVEL IV: KLs, GL, LUG What a staunch rationalist will want is for Levels II and III deductive- ly to entail level IV empirical generalizations. In the absence of such connection, what is the systematic relationship between the empirical Level IV and higher levels? I propose that we think of Kant's system, not as a logically connected set of propositions, but as a structure with two types of sentences: rules and descriptive generalizations. This procedure will be consistent with two things Kant says often: categories and space and time are a priori forms organizing empirical contents; and concepts and principles can be viewed as rules. Now what we get is this variant on Sketch I: SKETCH II SC=a set of general rules for the construction of any objects that can be humanly knowable; universally applicable rules of formation for statements about the world+the general semantics supplied by the schemata (Butts 1984, pp. 151-168) LM=Kant's pure laws of mechanics now construed as rules for anaZyzing motion in ways compatible with the general constraints of SC9 KLs, GL, LUG as empirical descriptions (general statements, not rules) formed by application of the synthetic a prioris of SC and LM as regulative principles. Schematically, Sketch II looks like this: RULES OF FORMATION: SC LM CONSTRUCTIONS: MCs EMPIRICAL LAWS</page><page sequence="11">695 SC and LM rules tell us how to arrive at the empirical laws, how to pro- ceed in formulating them. As Pap suggests, we can think of the law of inertia as being synthetic a priori (and in a limited sense immune from revision) in the functional or pragmatic sense of a priority. Together with Newton's second law "F=ma", it defines a method of analyzing mo- tions. 10 From the standpoint of methodology, Newton's first and second laws are of quite different types from, say, the law of universal gravi- tation. Indeed, the laws are used in the derivation of the law of uni- versal gravitation from Kepler's laws of planetary motion. One helpful way of formulating the point at issue is offered by Pap: [Newton's] second law can be formalized as a conjunction of two general statements, of which the first is a real definition and the second an existential statement: 'F=ma' , and 'there are forces which are relatively simple functions of distance.' The existential component of the second law is a general statement, an existential quantifier occurs in it. The law of gravitation, now, is a verifier of this general postulate, in that it indi- cates a definite force, viz., gravity, which satisfies the con- dition of being a relatively simple function of distance. Gravi- tational attraction is a value substitutable for the argument of the function 'relatively simple function of distance.' (1946, p. 48). My interpretation of the relationship between a priori principles and empirical descriptions finally construes all a priori principes as rules; the interpretation confirms that Kant's interest was methodolog- ical: All that we contribute a priori to things we use in the service of ever more detailed investigation of the phenomenal. In thus suggesting that Kant's a priori principles have all of them only regulative employ- ment, I am mindful of his distinction between constitutive and regula- tive employments of principles, but on my reading this distinction does work only within objectively constituted experience. Kant's ontological predicates, in other words, specify an ontology that is never an sich, but is always operative only within the domain of the phenomenal. This interpretation of judgements or principles as rules is not novel (I have mentioned some of those who earlier urged this emphasis). What has not been sufficiently emphasized (and what the bewildering details of Buchdahl's working out of his correct insight obscure) is that the transition from metaphysics to physics is for Kant based on appeal to methodological considerations. This appeal is first made in Critique of Pure Reason, and is worked out still further in Critique of Judgement. In the Opus postumum (Gesammelte Schriften XXI, XXII) Kant refers to the methodological link as the doctrine of scientific research (Naturfor- schung=scrutatio naturae), a doctrine that would set forth the subjec- tively valid principles for conducting research. Such principles would be valid a priori (in my language, would finally receive their warrant from SC) (XXI, p. 168, p. 360; XXII, p. 312). The only discussion I know of in English of Kant's fragmentary treatment of the transition in these volumes is in Werkmeister (1980, Ch. VI). This discussion is itself fragmentary, but, as usual, Werkmeister's references are scrupulously complete and helpful. In my discussion of affinity below, I will refer to one of Kant's own specific examples of how this methodology works.

Affinity: the Linchpin of Kant's Methodology I want to end this essay by close discussion of some methodological matters only briefly sketched in (1984). If what I urge above is right, there is no direct deductive connection between the principles of the schematized categories, the pure laws of natural science, and observa- tional and experimental laws. Questions remain: What is the connection between the rules and the descriptions? What, if anything, guarantees that the rules will apply? How can we know, if at all, that Nature [N] universally and necessarily structures nature [n]? One thing is abun- dantly clear: For Kant the answers to these questions cannot be gotten by consulting experience. The lawlikeness of descriptive laws is not em- pirically justified. Laws of (empirical) association are fully contin- gent. That some regularly associated sets of events and objects enter into full natural laws cannot ever be a consequence of the associations themselves, however strong and recurrent they may be. Indeed, in the first edition of KRV Kant suggests that empirical as- sociation is a "mere consequence" of a higher form of composition of the manifold of appearances: a consequence of transcendental affinity. When we postulate that in some cases at least regularly associated sets of appearances require us to have fixed expectations about the course of nature [n], we do so on the basis of the "affinity of the manifold" (A113, 114). Transcendental affinity is thus a compelling logical fea- ture of apperception: That all appearances must be united in one con- sciousness is the logically necessary precondition of the objectivity of any possible experience. From which Kant appears to conclude that there must be objects with constant qualities, and events with repeated fea- tures, in nature [n]. But this is only to repeat a fact of logic about transcendental apperception: In order for there to be objective knowl- edge all predicates must unite in a single logical subject. And this condition, although clearly necessary for any regularity at all (includ- ing lawlikeness in nature [n]), is just as clearly not sufficient to warrant the strong conclusion that transcendental affinity has empirical affinity as a "mere consequence". What would the sufficient condition have to be? Kant goes on at A114 to suggest that the connection between transcendental and empirical affinity only holds by virtue of the fact that we have to deal with aggregates of appearances, suggesting there- fore that in addition to the necessity of apperception, we would require noumenal regularity--what we cannot ever have for Kant: Knowledge of regularities connecting things as they are in themselves. Beck suggests (1981, p. 457), and I think the suggestion is correct, that this threat- ened line of metaphysical retreat may be the reason why the section I am discussing was deleted by Kant from the second edition. And so again we raise the question: What warrant have we, if any, that affinity at the level of logic is captured by affinity at the level of empirical happening? What common source or ground weds empirical law with transcendental principle, nature [n] with Nature [N]? What catalyst links these dissimilars? The short answer: The common principle unifying particular empirical laws and a priori principles is the subjectively necessary, transcendental presupposition that this dismaying, unlimited diversity of empirical laws and this</page><page sequence="13">697 heterogeneity of natural forms does not belong in nature [nature [n]], that, instead, nature is fitted for experience as an em- pirical system through the affinity of particular laws under more general ones. (First Intro, p. 209). That there can be a legal marriage of the dissimilars represented by em- pirical laws and by a priori SC laws is a regulatively presupposed con- dition of assurance that we can carry out the scientific programme, that the project initiated by SC (and the pure laws of physics) can be suc- cessfully pursued. We have no access to knowledge that nature [n] is an sich lawlike (that God is in his transcendent heaven and all is well with the scientific world), and logic alone cannot give us any assurance of a metaphysically grounded marriage of form and matter. Rights of kin- ship are here established as regulative only; they are rights we require of our systems, not, as Kant says, of our nature [n]. Regulative affinity as a methodological concept had been discussed by Kant in KRV in the pivotal appendix "T'Ae Regulative Employment of the Ideas of Pure Reason" (A657-663/B685-691). Three ideas of reason yield maxims (principles that are subjectively necessary in the attempt to realize the interests of reason) that govern our search for taxonomies of natural forms, our phenomenal scientific projects: the ideas of homo- geneity, variety and affinity. The corresponding principles are those of homogeneity, specification and continuity. The first bids us seek unity in variety; the second, variety under unity; the third, unity in variety and variety under unity "as all springing from the same stem". The prin- ciple of affinity urges upon us recognition that in a proper classifica- tion of natural kinds strict rights of kinship must be observed. The prescribed continuity of forms is, however, an idea, not a concept ap- plicable to objects. It is a requirement on the form of our systematic projects in doing science; it is not a feature of either Nature [N] or nature [n].' 2 Nevertheless, Nature [N] forms a set of universal laws. To hold that nature [n] has an affinity for Nature [N] is thus to say only that we must proceed as if all of the logical parsimony and simplicity possessed by Nature [N] can be found to be shared by the two natures, because we require that there be simple laws for the sake of doing empirical sci- ence. The common ground from which spring both Nature [N] and nature [n] is thus the order of logic as systematic fit. The principle of affinity, at this high level, is a principle which, if violated, leads to unclear epistemological blood lines and blurred metaphysical rights of posses- sion. In a world of humans made so that they can know God directly, God would turn out to be the source and goal of the affinity. In Kant's world, that source and goal identify only the focus imaginarius. But the ideal of reason gives good focus indeed. If we think of the Kantian sys- tem as a taxonomy of what can be known, one whose principles are those of the schematized categories applicable only to sense intuiteds, then there is no good reason not to extend SC expectations to those princi- ples instantiated by matter in motion; and there is no good reason not to suppose that the application of laws of pure physics in the formation of empirical laws cannot yield a large number of such laws all having the same lawlikeness features as the laws of SC and of pure physics. Here the affinity running throughout the epistemology as a classifica- tion scheme is a continuity of kinds of forms of laws with increasing expectations of empirical confirmation as the classificational manifold</page><page sequence="14">698 is specified (in Kant's technical sense). Because of the assumption of continuity of forms, there will never be a point at which we arrive at the infima species, and that there will always and forever be more law forms to write down increases the likelihood that we can someday get confirmations (or disconfirmations) of lower level descriptive laws hav- ing the required form. And so to construe the epistemological taxonomy as the never-ending generator of more and more laws of greater and greater specificity (and commonness of forms) is to render it the equiv- alent of Kant's insistence that we lose nothing if we settle for at- tempts, in principle never-ending ones, to explain the phenomenal domain to which all genuine knowledge claims are directed. The striking thing about Kant's regulative principle of affinity is that we can easily produce historical cases that exactly fit what he had in mind at the level of methodology. It may be that finally even sympa- thetic readers of Kant will continue to balk at the demand (thought to be quite excessive) that we employ SC principles (and principles of pure physics as well) as the only ones applicable in the production of empir- ical science. An alternative is so to generalize the principles as to make them vacuous and uncontentious. This has been done, for example, by those positivists who, like Arthur Pap, suggest that the principle of causality of the Second Analogy be viewed as transformable into the reg- ulative demand that we investigate nature on the assumption that it will yield laws. I3 think the Second Analogy does give warrant for this rule, but that is not all Kant intended. These rnatters of large-scale interpretive emphasis aside, as a final point about the continuing in- terest of Kant's discussion of lofty regulative principles, I want to turn attention to his own example of how the assumption of affinity, the assumption of common source or liability to fit a common pattern of uni- ty, portrays a methodological strategy of great interest and importance. The principle of affinity gives us subjective assurance of the sta- bility of things grouped under kinds, and also assurance of stability of properties of things and the forces or powers that hold them together. 14 In an example, Kant has us begin with the imperfect empirical observa- tion that the planets move in circular orbits. Subsequently, we notice deviations from circular orbiting, and we "trace the deviations to that [force] which can change the circle, in accordance with a fixed law, through all the infinite intermediate degrees, into one of these diver- gent orbits" (the discussion of Kant's example follows A662-663/B690- 691). This is to assume that the movements of the planets that are not circular will approximate to the properties of a circle, and this yields the idea of an elliptical orbit. [In later language, one might suggest that we are here "colligating" the paths of celestial objects under the idea of circular path.] We now observe that comets deviate even further from true circular paths, and by application of the same reasoning--as- suming affinity of kinds of motion under a common principle (in this case, the same force that causes the deviations)--we conclude that they move in parabolic courses. What we are doing, Kant thinks, is discover- ing, by employment of the principle of affinity, "a unity in the generic formis of the orbits, and thereby a unity in the cause of all the laws of planetary motion, namely, gravitation." We then go further in our at- tempt to explain by the same principle all observed variations and de- partures from the discovered rules. And Finally, we even go on to make additions such as experience</page><page sequence="15">699 can never confirm, namely, to conceive, in accordance with the rules of affinity, hyperbolic paths of comets, in the course of which these bodies entirely leave our solar system, and passing from sun to sun, unite the most distant parts of the universe, a universe which, though for us unlimited, is throughout held to- gether by one and the same moving force. (emphasis supplied). Colligation leads to "consilience". Reasoning under the guiding princi- ple of affinity brings physical speculation to the common point, the fixed law, the source of a confirmed explanation. In this role, affinity is an inductive methodological principle par excellence, and one discus- sed with approval under other names. Thus we see that, for Kant, affinity even permits us, as a matter of justified scientific procedure, to infer beyond the limits of already given consequences of controlled observation and experiment. Indeed, it warrants inference beyond the limits of any possible such consequences (as in the case of inference to universal gravitation); but never, of course, beyond the limits of possible experience. (Recall: the subjec- tive necessity of the rule of affinity constrains research strategies, including strategies of inductive inference; it does not entitle us to flights of constitutive metaphysical fancy. No rule of method speaks to the reality of objective findings.) The confidence in our inductive ca- pacity to infer beyond the limits of present and in principle confirma- tory experience does not, then, run counter to Kant's thesis of the pos- tulates of empirical thought in general: Our knowledge of the existence of things reaches ... .only as far as perception and its advance according to empirical laws can extend. (A226/B273). Inductive inferences grounded in assumed affinity do depend upon related clusters of empirical generalizations; it is the postulated continuity of forms of laws that licenses inference beyond the known cluster. For those requiring something other than the subjective assurance of the viability of methodological maxims, Kant can only offer his brief comments on what he calls "doctrinal belief", commitment to the correct- ness of theoretical claims that is analogous to "pragmatic belief" in the realm of the practical (A823-825/B851-853). In the interest of help- ing his patient, a physician must act even in those cases where he does not know the exact nature of the illness. The touchstone of his belief is a question of how much he will bet on an expected outcome of his ac- tion. Analogously, the natural scientist must often face the situation in which he thinks himself to have sufficient theoretical grounds for believing a certain proposition, even though there exist no present means of obtaining certainty, as is always the case at the level of con- tingent empirical science. Here it is apparently a question of how much one is prepared to run conceptual risks: how much of one's putatively established science one is prepared to jettison if the outcome were to turn out to be other than what one doctrinally believes. Kant's example is this one: I should be ready to stake my all on the contention--were it possible by means of any experience to settle the question--that at least one of the planets which we see is inhabited. Hence I</page><page sequence="16">700 say that it is not merely opinion, but a strong belief, on the correctness of which I should be prepared to run great risks, that other worlds are inhabited. Kant was prepared to hazard a great deal in those cases where what one hypothesizes about the course of nature [n] conforms to the condi- tions of SC knowing. I think it is for this reason that he takes so ser- iously the question of a priori foundations of knowing in natural sci- ence. In the absence of the subjectively necessary maxims of method with their limited a priori guarantees, we run the large risk of losing con- ceptual sanity. It is one thing to hypothesize categorial possibilities that are out of range of what we now know; it is quite another deliber- ately to exaggerate those possibilities, betting, as does the classical metaphysician, too little on outcomes too important to underbid. 15 We have seen that Kant appears to be content to settle for a marriage of formal law and descriptive law that is, in a literal methodological sense, a marriage of convenience. The principle of causality and the law of universal gravitation are kith and kin only because, though dissimi- lar, they are similarly focused. To bring them together in any more met- aphysically compelling way would require that the focus of our scientif- ic imagination turn into that big double-barreled shotgun in the sky, threatening to spray the not-yet-united lovers with an infinite collec- tion of forever diverse and variegated noumenal buckshot. Kant taught us, to his everlasting credit, that the ammunition chambers of that imagined gun are phenomenally empty, null and meaningless--in principle and always. Notes 1Not that this was the first philosophical expression of dissatisfac- tion with Kantian synthetic a prioris; for example, the Reichenbach-Ein- stein exchange in Schilpp (1949, pp. 289-311; 676-679) had already neat- ly arranged the relevant debating points. 2The sources were rich ones: Lewis and Dewey, Mach and Schlick. It became clear by the 1950s that we were going to have to get used to very different styles of thinking about the a priori. 3A start was made at the Third International Kant Congress; see the papers by Buchdahl and Palter, and my comments, in Beck (1972, pp. 149- 199). Brittan (1978) makes a worthwhile contribution to our understand- ing of some aspects of Kant's philosophy of science; Kitcher (1983) re- pays very careful study; all of us eagerly await publication of the re- sults of Michael Friedman's study of Kant's philosophy of physics (pre- sented in seminars at University of Western Ontario in Spring 1984). Kant's philosophy of mathematics has been studied by Hintikka (eg., 1969), Parsons (1971) and Kitcher (1975). Palter (in Beck 1972), Harman (1982), Okruhlik (1983) and Duncan (1984) deal with Kant's Die metaphys- ische Anfangsgruinde der Naturwissenschaften. Harper (1981) contributes much to our understanding of the logic of the Second Analogy. These se- lective references do not exhaust the good work that has been done re- cently.</page><page sequence="17">701 4Kant mentioned the possibility of a second special metaphysics, that of "objects" of internal sense, or of the soul . However, he required of a proper science that its subject matter be mathematizable; contents of inner sense are not mathemnatizable; therefore a science cannot be devel- oped on the basis of the special metaphysics of the soul . Only bodies moving in space can be objects of proper science. I argue elsewhere that this accounts for Kant's clinical and nosological interest in psychical phenomena: He replaces the impossible science of the soul with a behav- iouristic psychopathology, one whose nosology of mental disorders groups deviations from normal schematized category knowing into clinical syn- dromes (Butts 1984, pp. 298-310). 5The insistence that natural science must be essentially mathematical is clearly stated in MAN, p. 470. That all objects of possible experi- ence must be mathematical idealizations (constructs) of appearances is a central claim of the transcendental programme. See KRV A162-176/B202- 218; A142-43/B182-83. 6"Metaphysical and Internal Realism: the Relations between Ontology and Methodology in Kant's Philosophy of Science". Typescript copies were distributed to those who attended the session. 7Kant is here talking about empirical natural science, not about the metaphysical foundations of natural science, as he makes clear in what follows the quoted line. Conjecture is typical of the former, a priori certainty is a feature of the latter, as we have seen. 8This discussion necessarily bypasses what is at another level a cru- cial problem for Kant: What about the ontological status of moral agents? or persons? Since practical reason can only postulate such "ob- jects" on analogy with objects resulting from schematized categories, what ontological status can be accorded them: useful fictions? 9Both SC and LM require that objects of proper science be mathematiz- able; mathematics constructs its objects; hence we must have a set of MCs (mathematical constructions) yielding the physical meaning of each LM. For example, the second Kantian law of mechanics (the principle of inertia) provides part of the ontology of bodies by allowing construc- tion of motion as an object of possible experience through provision of a "geometrical curve whose direction at each point is determined by the tangent (the geometrical representation of the first derivative, which is identical with velocity, if the horizontal axis of the codrdinate system represents the time); and the physical meaning of the tangent is just inertial motion." (Pap 1946, pp. 43-44). Constructions are of course required for each of the Kantian principles in pure physics; they pro- vide intuitive warrant for the possibility or intelligibility of the concepts involved. There is no space here to deal with the crucially im- portant Kantian idea of constructions in any detail. 10Kant does not list "F=ma" as a law of motion, although his discus- sion indicates that he accepts "ma". Did he realize that the law of in- ertia is a special case of "F=ma", where F=O? See Okruhlik (1983, pp. 252-253) for a brief discussion of Kant's failure to mention explicitly Newton's second law. I suspect that Kant's failure to record acceptance of the identity has to do with his conviction that forces are not fully constructible, hence cannot be fully available for mathematical treat-</page><page sequence="18">702 ment. Throughout his career he wanted to retain the idea of some kind of empirical access to forces, and for him forces manifested in the motions of objects given in space and expressed as external relations between such objects were finally the best candidates. Such "transeunt" forces replaced the empirically inaccessible immanent forces of Leibniz. 11 Some words about the word. Kant uses both Affinitat and Verwandt- schaft in first Critique. In Anthropologie (Sect. 31, 31c) he uses Ver- wandtschaft and the Latin affinitas. Affinitas means relationship through marriage (as in the Church of England Common Prayer "Table of Kindred and Affinity"). Verwandtschaft shares these connotations; Affin- itdt should probably be construed as Kant's preferred technical term, although he uses Affinitdt and Verwandtschaft interchangeably and with- out distinction in first Critique (for example, A657-663/B685-691). In Anth. 31c his examples are catalytic interaction of chemical substances and marriage. Affinity names a kind of relationship between dissimilars, and unites through a common ground or source. In methodological contexts the rule of affinity enjoins us to search for what Whewell called "con- silience": systematic unification achieved by a convergence of initially unrelated inductions. Shortly we will see that Kant's favourite example of systematic unification or consilience is one shared by Whewell: uni- versal gravitation. 12I cannot develop the point here, but what I am saying about system- atic organization of classification schemes as Kant viewed it seems to me to confirm Kitcher's (1983) claim that for Kant a scientific theory is a "projected order of nature". Much that I argue for in (1984) de- pends upon accepting Kitcher's correct insight. 13, In so far as the term 'science' essentially connotes an activity aiming at the discovery of laws, the principle of causality, interpreted as an imperative, may, indeed, be said to be presupposed by the very possibility of science: science is the successful response to the imper- ative expressed by the principle of causality. On this point philoso- phers as widely opposite in their attitude towards Kant's critical ide- alism as Schlick and Cassirer seem to agree." (Pap 1946, p. 68). Kant does suggest that the Second Analogy is grounded in the principle of sufficient reason: "The principle of sufficient reason is thus the ground of possible experience, that is, of objective knowledge of ap- pearances in respect of their relation in the succession of time." (A201/B246). However, as we have seen, instantiated by matter in motion, the principle of causality leads us to have strong expectations about the specific explanatory framework that will correctly explicate cases of observed motion. The agreement attributed to Cassirer and Schlick thus seems of little consequence. 14At this stage specialists in the thought of Kant will want to re- mind us that the problem of property stability is important for Kant in a number of related contexts. At A90/B123 he recognizes the problem: "Appearances might very well be so constituted that the understanding should not find them to be in accordance with the conditions of its uni- ty. Everything might be in such confusion that, for instance, in the series of appearances nothing presented itself which might yield a rule of synthesis and so answer to the concept of cause and-effect. This con- cept would then be altogether empty, null, and meaningless." Even empir- ical memory (reproductive imagination) requires stability of properties:</page><page sequence="19">703 "If cinnabar were sometimes red, sometimes black, sometimes light, some- times heavy.. .my empirical imagination would never find opportunity when representing red colour to bring to mind heavy cinnabar." (Al00-I01). At least some of these specialists will also want to hold that Kant's argu- ment in the transcendental deduction yields justified objective grounds for stability of properties. I think, however, that here we must score one for Buchdahl. Lawlikeness of empirical laws presupposes stability of properties, but the assumption of stability of properties rests on the principle of affinity--a subjectively valid regulative principle. Here there is a "messy" articulation, rather than a clinching argument. In the absence of an sich realist convictions, it is extremely difficult to argue into existence a stable and epistemologically reliable external world. 15After presentation of the paper, my colleague Margaret Morrison re- minded me of the passage in which Kant states that principles like af- finity "carry their recommendation directly in themselves" (KRV, A661/B689), and warned that unless I can give an appropriate reading of Kant's claim here, the appeal to a pragmatic justification of subjective principles is unavailing. This is a well-taken point, and one worth careful development. My suggestion is that Kant is here pointing out that the success of the principles as methodological components of New- ton's (essentially correct) physics is one that can be universalized by being "represented as objective" in much the same way as are aesthetic judgements of taste. This would be consistent with Kant's belief that Newtonian physics (including its methodology) is the best example of successful science. The suggested reading also brings judgement of the acceptability of methodologies within the ambit of judgements of taste. Thus we might say that one who rejects the described Newtonian methodol- ogy is guilty of poor "epistemic" taste. This exegetical line, one that brings Kant's thought closer to that of Nelson Goodman and (perhaps) to that of Putnam, is one that obviously requires more extensive working out than can be accomplished here. Kant's suggestions concerning univer- salizability of subjective maxims and public consensus are at (KRV, A820-22/B848-50), and at (Critique of Judgement, Sect. 40).</page><page sequence="20">704 References References to Kant's works follow page numbers of the Academy Edition.
