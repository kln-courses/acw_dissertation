London: the Athlone Press. 1965. Pp. xi + 390. ?3 I5s. In this latest addition to the vast literature deal- ing with Fate in Homer and Hesiod attention is concentrated on the meaning and development of the subject in popular cults and practices in the Myce- naean evidence and in early Greek literature with a view to obtaining a better understanding of the concept in Homeric epic. As in Greece man was regarded as the focal point in the universe, the ap- proach to the gods4 nature and the world was primarily anthropomorphic. Therefore, Fate in its various implications was a later development as an abstract concept in relation to a personal conception of Deity. The present study opens with a brief examination of the original significance of the Greek words for Fate as an introduction to its chief figures in the primitive aspects of the belief. In this first section the daemon and the hero are reviewed and their respective functions examined. Daem6ns as vegetation spirits with chthonian associa- tions are differentiated from heroes and gods before the Minoan-Mycenaean term was given a wider and undefined Hellenic application to any mythical beings, or, indeed, to supernatural power like 'mana' or the 'numinous'. Then when it determined human destiny it acquired the meaning of 'fate'. Heroes, on the other hand, were intermediaries between gods and men, but they were confined mainly to the cult of the dead, and to the ancestral tradition, conspicuous by their absence in Homer, except as akin to the gods, though, as is suggested, echoes of the hero cult may occur in the funeral games of Patroclus and in the burial of Sarpedon with his clothes. But in any case, it was not practised as a cultus until they were deified or absorbed by Olympian gods, as ancient figures were idealized or, conversely, became gods 'faded' into heroes and worshipped at their tombs, and so localised. They never, however, gave rise to the idea of Fate like the daemons as chthonic agents watchful over the deeds of men dispensing their destinies. It was in the sphere of vegetation that the daemon and the hero met. The vexed question of the figure of Moira is next discussed and its position and determination in Homeric epic subjected to a detailed investigation in both sections of the book, ranging from its early chthonic connotations with death, with vegetation and nature in general, and the 'lot' or 'rightful portion' of the individual, to its personification as a trio of goddesses. Associated with them were the dread Erinyes with their comparable chthonic and nature origins but engaged in imposing curses, manslaying and vengeance. They were, however, also earth deities, as is pointed out, having con- nexions with Ge, Demeter and Aphrodite, concerned with fertility and birth, as well as with inflicting death and exercising their sinister functions. The part played by the snake and the horse in the Erinys cult is evaluated and made responsible for a good deal of colouring of her qualities, the snake often standing for the soul of the dead returning to avenge blood guilt. Her connexions with Artemis as Mistress of the Animals is also significant in view of her death- bestowing qualities. In Part II Fate and the Gods in Homer are investigated and the debt to popular religious thought in the epic is estimated, presenting a curious mixture of popular belief and that of the period in which the poems were composed. The concept of Moira as the death-bringing agent was retained in close association with the figure of Erinys, but undergoing important changes, Fate governing the life of the individual in a variety of aspects. Both are deprived of the personality they had in the popular cult, and several concepts of Fate exist side by side, tending to become more impersonal as man was increasingly made responsible for his own destiny. In the absence of any ethical conception of Deity and of a teleological ordering of human affairs, the only absolute fatalism was the inevitability of death, the gods as spinners of Fate for good or ill weighing</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS 235 the results in the scales of Zeus. It is they alone who constitute a personal element of Fate in Homer, but this has no uniformity, though especially in the Iliad and the Odyssey they are the guardians of justice, and moral agents of the fate of men, Zeus becoming the supreme arbiter of events. This volume is a notable contribution to a subject which of course has long been in debate, and so far as the pre-Homeric evidence is concerned is still somewhat conjectural, But in these pages a good deal of light is thrown on the salient features of the nature, worship and functions of the daemon, the hero, Moira and Erinys, and their application to the working of Fate and the Olympian gods in the Iliad and the Odyssey.
