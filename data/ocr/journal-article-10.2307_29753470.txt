<plain_text><page sequence="1">Italian theatre ana the evolution of theatre If we want to have a clear idea of the history of theatre and its development, it is not only a good system but a necessary one, to go back to its origin and follow its course even if we limit our study only to the milestones of this course. It is difficult to understand and ap? preciate this important activity of our lives and spirit if we de not consider it in its genesis and its consequent evolution. We can only succeed in talking appreciatively of the whole problem if we, as we said before, go back to its very origin, or, in other words, follow its course step by step, even if not in detail. (We believe it is advisable to state, from this early stage, that by the word ? evolution )) we mean strictly its existence, transformation, and changes without any prejudice whatsoever to its gradual increase in intrinsic value which the idea of progress implies). Frederick Nietzsche in his cc The Birth of Tragedy ? stresses the importance which the introduction of Dionysiacal cult had for the Greeks, and not for them alone. It might be helpful to our study if we try to imagine what were the spiritual conditions before the development of this cult by contemplating once more the Doric temple: the architectural projection of two contrasting forces ? vertical and horizontal ?? going hand in hand in perfect harmony. The central position and direction of the system is clearly and, we might add, obviously shown in the upper part of the vertix of the pediment. No dualism exists, nor any sentiment of transcendence. Inside the temple the image of God has a human shape. The anthropomorphism may be noticed as a natural consequence not yet put in relation with the limits of conscience. (Which other shape could the divinity choose if not the loftiest among those the Maker himself has created?). In a substantially different way from the successive pantheistic conception, nature was everything and everything was nature. Existence and shape were the result of God's works, from minerals to man. Contrasting forces had to be intended as the clash and interweaving of threads in the manufacture of cloth. Not only there was no opposition, but there was not even a true conscience of separation between the outer world and the inner life. As it was obvious, all strengths, not only those which he knew and mastered, but also those of which he knew nothing, man attributed not to himself but to the gods. The ideas of intuition and inspiration came afterwards and are meant to indicate the possibility of a temporary contact with the spiritual world which already mean a state of separation. Even in his loftiest works man felt he was only an instrument, conscious and complex, but nevertheless a mere instrument of God. Homer begins his poem by beseeching the gods to sing for him, or rather in him. The state of subjugation of man towards God is obvious, organic, with no alternative. The sentiment of (( one ? dominated. From this sentiment the creative spirit of man could draw inspiration for his epics and lyrics, but the sentiment of &lt;( two ? was lacking and it was from this very senti? ment that dialogue, clash and drama could spring. Opposition and struggles among men could not bring about such a fundamental sentiment as long as they were also considered as being a part of the divine plans if not of the normal order of things. 112</page><page sequence="2">The cult of Dionysius profoundly changed this state of things. Dionysius is the only god which comes near man, fills him of his own self, excites his enthusiasms, makes him fall in ecstasy and mystical exaltation, and finally gives him back to himself with a new and wondering feeling of having been able to have gone beyond himself and thus join him. This new cult therefore contained new contrast? ing elements: life, for example, and wine, sacred to the god which is the bearer of it, and the ram which is also sacred to him in con? nection with vineyards because it is, by instict, their destroyer. The conscience of cc two ? has now come into being. Dionysius is the god in man. In the Dionysiacal cult, man consciously feels that he is part of the divinity. (The seed of a conscious separation is thus sown). Otae should closely notice how it was this seed of separation which, through interior ways, promotes the development necessary to the creation of drama. Such a development is already latent in the dithyrambs, the hymns sung to celebrate the feast in honour of Dio? nysius. Originally the dithyramb was sung by one imposing chorus made up of those devoted to the Dionysiacal cult. The singers used to become so exalted and excited as to suffer and rejoice with the god and live intensely the dramatic vicissitudes the song evoked. It was still merely a hint having an epic procedure, yet there was the beginning of the present reality, seed and origin of the actual perform? ances. The presence of contrasting forces becomes so simultaneous and pressing that the chorus itself is divided in two semi-choruses. Soon after that the two leaders of the semi choruses start a dialogue between themselves... The central nucleus was still missing, i. e. the hero around whom the dramatic structure revolved. Man taken as an only unit did not, however, possess the necessary feeling of being the centre of something, and the presence of Dionysius was only narrated and felt in its re? flexes. And then finally semeone came, full of enthusiasm, ready to answer invocations through the words of the god. The character of the ipocrites was born, Dionysius himseli, the centre of the performance: the hero. With the first great tragedies another step forward is accomplished. From divinity we come gradually down to what is human. A man, with a greater spiritual force, takes the place of the god as the principal character of the drama. There is, however, not yet any human antagonism, there is no individual con? flict of contrasting interests; rather, they are of a universal character. On one side we have the human condition awakened to its own consciousness, with a slight feeling of indign? ation which may be considered the forerunner of a wish for individual freedom, on the other the unchanged order of superhumanity where? by man no longer feels, as it happened before, quietly absorbed, almost a system of exterior laws to which he must relentlessly comply (Fate). According to our opinion, at this point the actual existence of drama is completed. The conflict between man and man which appears to make ever more manifest the motive and essence of the drama, is in reality merely a way to show a greater conflict: between man and those forces which, by the very evolution of his being, are turned in succession against him. If in ordinary life the individual action may appear to have a value only for the person himself or within the limits of his direct social relations, in drama it must be considered as an expression showing how man, by his actions is carried towards closer human and cosmic relations of greater and vaster importance. The communion between the stage and audience, the Eucharistie mystery which took place and may again take place between poet and audience, may be possible if in the drama there is what is operating in life without ap? pearing to do so. And this is common know? ledge to all: there is a connection between the individual and human condition, between human condition and the world itself and between the world and the strength which promotes all evolutions. In these references, by means of revealing contrasts, the spectator is carried outside his normal and daily at? mosphere to come face to face with himself; a large picture from which he receives impul? ses of knowledge and action. With the Romans, even at a superficial glance, it immediately appears that there is not only an imitation of the great Greek models. The developing process towards individual? ism is greatly reproduced by this outstanding people on the plane of concrete reality. The 113</page><page sequence="3">relations with the divine have taken another turn in respect of the Greeks. For the Romans, the gods did not sit on the top of a mountain, looking after their own business, among which were the evolution of the world and human fate. Roman gods lived in Rome and their only preoccupation was to lead the Romans to a great work of conquest, realizations and uni? fication. We don't want there to be any misun? derstanding on this point. The Romans believ? ed in their gods and honoured them with a deep and austere convinction. For them also the control of the world was to be found within a divine spiritual sphere. Their priests and chiefs officiated the various rites with a pure initiatory disposition, being aware of what they were doing on the spiritual plane. But con? trary to the Greeks, the Romans, in their relations with the divine, had the feeling of being invested with something, of having to carry out a mission in this world, not of a messianic nature, but in accordance with a feeling which later on, on account of a similar feeling, will promote the Crusades for the li? beration of the Holy Sepulchre. From this feeling derives the cc dignitas ? which may be compared to the introduction of a typical form of human individuality, built on interior laws, in a clear, we were almost going to say classic, connection of hierarchical inter-independence between the human being and super-humanity. In art this tendency towards individuality, i. e. to be fully conscious of a point of interference of universal forces in the individual, can be above all identified in a plastic sense, in portraying sculpture. A proof of this may be found in the reproduction of those heads which are to be found in the tombs lying along the Appian way. All these heads have a charac? teristic of their own which cannot be taken for anything else but the faithful reproduction of what had been a living man. Biographies, such as are to be found in the ? Lives y&gt; by Plutarchus, are here well represented and reproduced. In such a world there is no place for a perturbing Dionysius of the many terrible alternatives, of human exaltation and cosmic sorrow. There is, rather, place for Pan, rustic and full of humour or, better still, Bacchus who thrills and excites people, making rites more lively and is present in all feasts. There cannot be, therefore, a Roman tragedy, but merely Seneca's tragedy, a great imitative talent but, in this respect, also rather decadent. His works are undoubtedly of great importance and inspired authors of the Renaissance. They did not, however, add anything essential to what had been incomparably expressed by the Greeks. The importance acquired by man and, consequently, the inevitable expansion of his defects was bound to inspire those geniuses who had an inclination for such kind of things : satyre, comedy and drama. If satyres had already acquired great developments through Aristophanes, in a kind of performance which is very near to modern satyrical light opera, comedy reached in Rome its essential structure chiefly through the works of Plautus. To comedy belong well defined human characters, situations and plots, comical developments which are the result of a strength, of a theatri? cal coherence exasperated and polarized. Ennius, Terentius and Plautus introduce in the evolution of theatre that impulse peculiar to the conception of the world: measuring human dimensions in a universal perspective. In compliance with such a conception the value of limitation also has its natural development and affirmation. Such a limitation is not a separation, but an individual pledge of coor? dination full of significance. In the Greeks the sentiment of separation had given birth to Tragedy. In the Romans, instead, the senti? ment of limitation introduced the necessary condition for the further development of drama. We may, of course, speak of a contraction, or limitation of horizon. This is, however, one of the elements always present in the evolution of life and theatre. For many centuries, after the affirmation of Christianity, we cannot speak of any type of theatre in the true sense of the world. In Christian Liturgy, the priests by symbolic gestures repeated in front of the Altar the divine drama, while the crowds of the faithful participated in it by devotedly following the action. If these manifestations proved that the Eucharistie essence of drama was not dead in itself, it was not possible, in view of the spirit prevailing at the time, to talk, as yet, of a theatrical revival. (c Liturgical Dialogues ? of the Byzantine period are to be considered as polemic express? ions, which in point of fact have nothing to 114</page><page sequence="4">do with the spirit of theatrical works. They consisted in an apologetic dialogue, with no stage action or internal movement. They are nothing else but abstract philosophic and theo? logical discussions. Nor did the cc Sacred Byzantine Drama ? have a very greater significance in respect to theatre, because it was not the result of a revival, but the residue of a human interest with heathen tendencies. Because of these tendencies, symbolic actions of liturgical nar? ratives developed, but only as regards repetit? ion of facts, episodes and in the identification of characters described in the Sacred Writings. However, in spite of the presence of mimic and choreographic actors, as there were in the last heathen theatres, these characters never went beyond the reproduction or illustration of Sacred Texts according to the Gospel and Christian legends. Especially as regards the West, towards which were directed the developing forces and in which we are particularly interested, the reasons of this lethargy of dramatic creative impulses, lasting ten centuries, were due to several causes. It was not only on account of an iconoclastic spirit which in the first en? thusiasm of Christianity fiercely reacted against all things coming from the heathen world, but more particularly on account of the fact that, by denying one of the two meanings, i. e. by giving no importance to whatever was human, the primary condition leading to dramatic dia? logue was missing. The sentiment of time is a sentiment of precariousness, that nothing lasts in this world. The human condition is but the expectation, more or less active, to join God in the name or through the intervention of Christ. The ideal ie to make the hardest renunciations during our life in this world. We have thus once more the conscience of a dividing line between what is divine and what is human, but in a dif? ferent plane of subordination. All must be granted to what is divine and all must be denied to what is human. Dionysius is now only one of the (( false and lying gods ?, a Strength of deceipt which swells the head of people. Prometheus, should he reappear, could no longer be looked upon as a friend of man, but as the enemy of God, a rebel angel: Lucifer. Christ in himself is not accepted as an il? luminating and strengthening power having a value for our lives, but only as a lofty encour agement to abandon life and lead us towards eternal safety, as a means to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. With Christ another great possibility had arisen as regards the future of the world: that Resurrection might follow and take the place of cc catastrophe ?. Thus, even if the meaning of Passion and Easter had not reached the sphere of conscience, its presence in the world must have helped to preclude the sources of tragic inspiration. It must be, moreover, pointed out that the impulse from which liturgical representations arose in the West, have, so to speak, a contrary direction to the one which had acted in Byzan thium. Here, as already mentioned, fragments and residues influence the new rite and enlarge it. In the West, instead, the Sacred Repre? sentations are born of a pressure which precedes the creation of a new form, when turning from the Latin into the ? vulgar )&gt; tongues. It is enough to take in consideration the logical and elaborate trend given to trans? cendence in the French word cc misteres ?, even if the theatre could not be born again from them, contained as they are within the rigid limits of theological principles, precise and abstract like formulas. The basic condit? ion was always the same, either in the case of birth or of rebirth: that man, and not his ideas of God, should occupy second place. As we shall see further on, such a condition was attained in Italy. In the turning points of the world, there is always a great human figure which, through his life, works and words, incarnates the new trend which the Spiritual, the Divine wishes to impress on the forces of evolution. This great human figure was Francis of Assisi With him died that long period of pessimism, darkness and religious intolerance which had submerged all the values of the world. Through him, creatures and things acquired once again their true meaning. He preached that God was not only in churches, but also among people. He sang the Lord's praises, not in his direct but more or less abstract attributes, but rather in his works, in his creatures, inasmuch as they live and their presence can be felt by means of our senses. 115</page><page sequence="5">Franciscan preaching roused a popular mo? vement of religious enthusiasm, which ex? tended from Umbria to other regions. Every? where the streets were crowded with people singing praise to God. A great, spontaneous movement called cc The Movement of the Hal? lelujah ?, because this was, so to speak, its battle cry, arose. Glory and praise to God for what He gives us in this life: sun, water and all other creatures, the elemental things which belong to all men, and for life itself on this planet, which acquires once again a weight, a centre and a meaning, otherwise Christ would have redeemed it uselessly... A similar movement of religious enthusiasm had previously made possible the birth of Greek tragedy from Dyonisiacal cult. Now as then, man begins, more or less dimly, to feel that he is an autonomous entity. We must now point out that in the process of formation the Italian theatre presents, at the beginning, another characteristic point of contact with the Greek theatre's. In both cases, there is at bottom a literary layer, a certain kind of poetic text in honour of the divinity, sung in religious choruses. Just as the human embryo repeats the past organic configurations of man, this fundamental poetic attitude expresses itself firstly in a lyrical form, then goes back through time welcoming the epic element, and finally when man feels an ever increasing urge towards a new life, new ways are opened moving towards the future. At this cross-point lies the existence itself of man: his entity and his fate, actions and counter-actions; the dramatic form is thus born. ? We have already spoken of the Dithyramb or Tragedy (the chant of the ram). The corresponding poetical basis in the creation of the theatre in Italy is the (c Laude ? of the XIII century. On its birth, in the Latin tongue, this form of poetry was already of a religious nature and was connected with cult. Confraternities of laymen, the Laudantes, were purposely organized to sing Landes in honour of the Mother of God. With the first Laude in the ? vulg?r ? tongue, on account of that breath of life which we might unsuitably describe as Coming cc from the bottom ?, a certain drama tic tension began to be felt. Naturally in Franciscan Umbria, the Laude before being represented, enucleates and an? nounces itself dramatically. For the Umbrian poets, it is no more a matter of hymns or praise. The cc Poverello ? has drawn so mar? vellously near earth to heaven, that they see the Madonna there, as if she were one of them, and they share with her, with a candid and powerful impetus, her grief of a Mother com? pelled to look on while her son is crucified. And they want to represent her as a true living figure: they are no longer satisfied to sing the feeling which she arouses in them. Thus, for these poets, the Laude is no longer a hymn to the Madonna, but becomes the cc Lamentation of the Madonna )). Let us consider the most famous of these cc Lamentations ? written by Jacopone da To di, a tertiary Franciscan monk who lived in the XIII century. It is one of the most sug? gestive and powerful sacred representations of that cycle, which were known as the cc Laudi drammatiche Umbre ? (Umbrian Dramatic Laudes). To be exact it would be a simple dialogue between the Mother of Jesus and a messenger. The latter describes to Her ? we say cc descri? bes )) and not cc narrates ? inasmuch as the Crucifixion is taking place under the eyes of the man himself ? the atrocities inflicted to her son. The Mother cc laments ? her pain and begs her Son to put an end to it. She asks him the meaning of this enormous and incomprehensible Thing, thus showing that the Mother of God is to be considered as a very human being. All this can be noticed still more directly in the pathos of the whole work, in its verses, in the exclusive cc sentiment ? of the repetit? ions and connected rhymes: Figlio, figlio, figlio! (Son, son, son!) figlio, amoroso giglio, (son, loving lily!) figlio chi da consiglia (son who will advise) al mio core angustiato? (my afflicted heart?) Figlio, occhi giocondi, (Son, happy eyes,) figlio, cd no respondi? (son, why don't you answer?) figlio, per che t'ascondi (son, why do you hide) dal petto 6 sei lattato? (from the breasts which have fed you?). We have said dialogue; as a matter of fact the actors are two. But in reality many others are present, ready to act and to take part in 116</page><page sequence="6">the Drama. They live through the allusions, narrations and evocations of these two alone who speak. When Jacopone da Todi wrote this work, he certainly never thought that it might be even? tually brought onto the stage. It is important to point out this circumstance. The determin? ing moment of a spontaneous formation can be clearly detected in this text, full, as it is, of a spontaneous and direct dramatic feeling; also for its dialogue and irresistible , theatrical exhortations. Francis of Assisi brought a powerful impul? se from above, with far-reaching consequences in the following centuries. He pointed out the trend of spiritual and divine forces for a new epoch or culture; a direction that passes through man and approaches nature... Jaco? pone, instead, with his rude and simple but powerful poetry, humanizes what is divine. Thus at the point of meeting, we have a cons? cious awakening, a new human condition, the first reincarnation of Drama. In the (c Sacre' Rappresentazioni ? which followed the cc Laudi Drammatiche Umbre ? ? and with Florence as the centre of revival ? there is already the cc theatre ?, both in the ancient and modern sense of the word. As a matter of fact beside and around the lasting verticality of the plot, life circulates freely with persons, characters, handicrafts and arts of man and with the spicy deformities, buf? fooneries and diatribes of the people. For example, the Madonna and St. Joseph are often met with in an inn of the times, where popular types and characters appear in a rudi mental scenical counter-play. The latter, through not reaching an amalgamation, is spontaneous and theatrical and has all the necessary characteristics. Certainly one must not look for an ideolo? gical or rhetorical style in such performances. Sacred and Profane are intermingled without formal order or intimate connection, and a hint of hierarchic perspective that may survive in them, has no relief or expressive function. But starting from this point we can right? fully speak again of Theatre and Drama. In another article we shall shortly describe the development of the Italian Theatre up to the present days, within the frame of the evolution of Western drama.
