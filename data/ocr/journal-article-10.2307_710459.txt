<plain_text><page sequence="1">200 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW J. HUSKINSON: Roman Sculpture from Eastern England. (Corpus Signorum Imperii Romani, Corpus of Sculpture of the Roman World, Great Britain, I, Fasc. 8.) Pp. xv+46; 32 Plates. Oxford: Oxford University Press (for the British Academy), 1994. ?45. This fascicule covers the counties of Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Lincolnshire, South Humberside, Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire. It is a relatively slight affair, with only 97 catalogue entries (three of which are classed as doubtful because of question-marks over provenance or authenticity) and less than 50 pages of text. This reflects the nature of the material, which consists of sporadic (and mostly rather unexciting) finds. The contributors to the Romano-British fascicules have had unequal tasks, depending upon the regions assigned to them, and one cannot help feeling that H. has drawn one of the short straws: many of the pieces which she has to deal with are fragmentary, battered and unprepossessing. In compensation, however, she has a few important and well known items, such as the bronze head from the River Alde in Suffolk, thought to be of Claudius (the rarely published profile view does not, in the reviewer's opinion, favour the identification) and the tombstones of M. Favonius Facilis and Longinus from Colchester, plus one or two pieces which pose interesting questions of interpretation, e.g. a relief of a mounted warrior spearing a snake- like creature from Stragglethorpe in Lincs. (no. 29), the relief of a pair of standing deities(?) within niches from Thorpe in Notts. (no. 18) and the torsos of two figures holding whips from Bedford Purlieus in Northants. (no. 35). H., who is an acknowledged expert on iconography and Roman sculpture not just in Britain but throughout the Empire, is sure-footed in her handling of the heterogeneous material, and this is an excellent catalogue. One can merely question aspects of the organization which are common to all the fascicules. The arrangement into sections of Greco-Roman deities, Romano- Celtic deities, anthropomorphic figures (including portraits), funerary monuments, altars, animals, and architectural sculpture, is not entirely satisfactory, because it is partly iconographic and partly functional, and leads to anomalies. Particular problems arise where function is unknown or there are uncertainties over identification (e.g. some of the 'anthropomorphic' figures could well be Greco-Roman or Celtic deities). The arrangement of deities in alphabetical order destroys the unity of groups such as the three statues from Sibson in Cambridgeshire (nos. 1, 7 and 10). The policy of not separating bronze works from stone is questionable. All these, alas, are faults ingrained in the series, and it is too late to rectify them now.

This handsome volume is based on the proceedings of the Sarkophag-Corpus held in Marburg in 1990. It is not surprising, then, that its contents offer rather less than the title appears to promise - no ash-chests or stele. Indeed, apart from one contribution by Dietrich Boschung partly devoted to funerary altars, and a short contribution by Friederike Sinn on a lost fragment of a relief from the Tomb of the Haterii, the 'Grabeskunst' discussed here is limited to sarcophagi, and then largely to Attic and Roman ones of the first three centuries A.D. Nevertheless within this remit, contributions are varied and wide-ranging. Moreover the contents seem to break down into well defined groups. The first four, for example, are concerned with garland sarcophagi. Fahri Isik and Dietrich Berges deal with the continuity of such sarcophagi from Hellenistic times into the early empire, providing background not only for the apparently anomalous Caffarelli sarcophagus but also for the inner face of the Ara Pacis screen- wall. However, as Boschung shows it was not until the early second century that the main series of garland sarcophagi began in Italy. This theme is taken up by Helga Herdejurgen who discusses the Campanian series, some with garlands and others with confronted griffins. The next two contributions are concerned with mythology. The distinguished iconographer Hellmut Sichtermann discusses the Bellerophon theme on Attic sarcophagi while Margherita Bonnanno Aravantinos looks at the story of Iphigenia in Tauris as shown on various ?
