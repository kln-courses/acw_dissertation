<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SHAMAN-PRIESTS OF THE CASAS GRANDES REGION, CHIHUAHUA, MEXICO Christine S. VanPool The Casas Grandes culture flourished between two well-known regions: Mesoamerica and the North American Southwest. An analysis of Medio period (A.D. 1200-1450) pottery suggests that Paquime, the center of the Casas Grandes world, was dominated by shaman-priests. The pottery includes images that document a "classic shamanic journey" between this world and the spirit world. These images can be connected to the leaders of Paquime and to valuable objects from West Mexico, indicating that the Casas Grandes leadership had more in common with the Mesoamerican system of shaman-leaders than with the political system of the Pueblo world of the North American Southwest. La cultura Casas Grandesflorecio entre dos regiones bien conocidas: Mesoamerica y el suroeste de Norteamerica. Un anali- sis de la cerdmica del periodo Medio (1200-1450 D.C.) sugiere que Paquime, el centro del mundo Casas Grandes, fue dom- inada por shamanes. La cerdmica incluye imagenes de fumadores, danzantes, y humanos con cabeza de guacamayo, que comparten dos diseiios, los "simbolos de libras" y los "circulos con puntos." Estas imagenes documentan una "jornada tipica shamanal," entre este mundo y el mundo de los espiritus. Las imaigenes shamanales se pueden conectar con los lideres de Paquime y con objetos de alto valor del oeste de Mexico, indicando que el liderato de Casas Grandes tenia mds en comun con la sistema Mesoamericana de lideres-shamanes que con la sistema politica del mundo Pueblo del suroeste de Norteamerica. hamans have fascinated anthropologists since the beginning of the discipline. By the middle of the twentieth century, anthropol- ogists such as Mircea Eliade (1964) had found "striking correspondence in shamanic practices, worldviews, and symbolic behaviors in hundreds of societies around the world," which led to the con- clusion that shamanic practices were "ancient and profoundly human" (Narby and Huxley 2001:4; see also Furst 1998). Shamans, commonly defined as intermediaries between the "natural" and "super- natural" worlds, communed with the supernatural through ritual and ecstatic trances to gain help and knowledge for healing, weather manipulation (e.g., rain seeking), divination, ensuring successful hunts, finding lost objects, self-empowerment, killing ene- mies, or other important activities such as ensur- ing fertility and fecundity for the benefit of their people (Atkinson 1987; Boyd 1996; Dobkin de Rios 1976; Eliade 1964:35; Furst 1972; Grim 1983; Joralemon and Sharon 1993; Myerhoff 1976:99; Narby and Huxley 2001; Peters and Price-Williams 1980; Robicsek 1978; Whitley 2000:156; Wilbert 1987). In the process, they thereby also validated their own personal importance and abilities to themselves and to their societies (Eliade 1964:35; Whitley 2000; Wilbert 1987:156-161). Although much has been written about shamans in ethnographically studied groups, archaeologists are discovering new evidence for shamanic prac- tices and their importance in the past (Bahn 1991; Bawden 1996; Boyd 1996, 1999; Clottes et al. 1998; Freidel et al. 1993:33-38; Furst 1998; Mal- otki 1997; Miller and Taube 1993:152; Schaafsma 1994; Whitley 2000; Winter 2000:265,298). These discoveries are likely to provide new insights about the diverse roles that shamans performed, and they illustrate that shamans were among the first polit- ical leaders in the New World, holding offices that also make them priests in an anthropological sense as well. Traditionally anthropologists have defined priests as members of the corporate structure who manipulate spirits, but unlike shamans do not become them. Priests hold full-time office whereas shamans are conceptualized as being part-time reli- gious practioners. In the real world religious prac- Christine S. VanPool ?

Recent iconographic analyses have demon- strated that shamanic priests/leaders are a funda- mental component of New World chiefdoms and state-level societies, including the Aztec (Dobkin de Rios 1976:34; Winter 2000:265, 298), the Col- ima of West Mexico (Furst 1998), the Maya (Frei- del et al. 1993:33-38; Miller and Taube 1993:152; Robicsek 1978), the Olmec (Furst 1968; Miller and Taube 1993:152), and the Moche (Bawden 1996). As a result, shamans were more than religious prac- tioners in many mid-level and complex societies in the New World before European contact; they served as heads of states and were commemorated in art and on public architecture (Miller and Taube 1993:33-34). The past role of shamans in the prehispanic cul- tures of the American Southwest and northern Mex- ico is largely unexplored. With the exception of Mimbres iconography (Cox 2001), the few studies addressing prehistoric shamanism in the American Southwest have focused on rock art images (Boyd 1996, 1999; Malotki 1997; Schaafsma 1994), and do not fully consider the role these shamans or shaman-priests may have played in political lead- ership in the area. Yet the depiction of shamans sug- gests that the cultures of the American Southwest and northern Mexico provide an excellent oppor- tunity to examine the roles of shamans in emerg- ing social hierarchies. Shamanic1 spiritual journeys are depicted on Chihuahuan polychrome vessels made during the Medio period (A.D. 1200-1450) of the Casas Grandes Culture in an area that includes northern Mexico, southern New Mexico and Arizona, and west Texas (Figure 1). As will be discussed more fully below, shamans are represented as effigy ves- sels of males kneeling and smoking, and as danc- ing anthropomorphic bird figures painted on jars. Designs such as serpents, sashes, pound signs, and small circles with central dots that are associated with the effigies of smokers distinguish them from female effigies and polychrome vessels decorated with geometric designs. Two of the designs (pound signs and small circles with a central dot found on the legs and chest) that characterize the smokers are also associated with specific figures painted on jars. These individuals are frequently depicted in odd stances, perhaps indicating dancing, and wear- ing hored/plumed-serpent headdresses and kilts (ritual paraphernalia), suggesting that they are involved in ceremonial activities. In a few cases, painted individuals with pound signs on their chests are depicted as macaw- or horned-headed humans. By tracing the designs on the smokers, dancers, and macaw-headed humans, a transformation sequence of males smoking, dancing, and metamorphosing into supernatural entities can be observed. These individuals represent shamans who are depicted in various stages of a "classic shamanicjourey" trav- eling to and from the spirit world. While these ceramics were being produced, the Casas Grandes region witnessed the development of social hierarchy based on institutionalized hered- itary leadership during the late 1200s and 1300s at the site of Paquime (Di Peso 1974; Rakita 2001; Ravesloot 1988). Two main interpretations about the extent of Paquime's authority have been put for- ward. First, it has been posited using World Sys- tems theory that the leaders at Paquime had economic control over the entire Casas Grandes region (Di Peso 1974,1983; Foster 1986; McGuire 1993:31-35; Reyman 1987; Whitecotton and Pailes 1986). The second argument maintains that the leaders at Paquime tightly controlled a 30-km core area around Paquime, and that there were compet- ing peer polities in the region (Whalen and Minnis 1996, 1999, 2001a, b). However, the actual form of the leadership has been unexplored. The findings presented here, based on the sym- bolic content and archaeological context of Casas Grandes imagery, suggests that leadership at Paquime was largely based on shamanic practices. However, the institutionalized leadership that was present is more indicative of priests. The merging of shamanic imagery in the context of priests there- fore indicates the presence of shaman-priests. Casas Grandes leadership was thus similar to, and may have been influenced by, Western Mexico shaman- priest practices and validated by the adoption of West Mexican traits including I-shaped ball courts, copper bells, and marine shells. The Shamanic Journey Cross-cultural studies of simple, mid-level, and complex societies indicate that shamans partici- pate in rituals that allow them to travel to the super- natural world. Most undergo what Sharon (1993:166; see also Myerhoff 1976) calls the Christine S.

Myerhoff (1976:102-103) and Sharon (1993:166) argue that the classic shamanic journey consists of three phases: (1) leaving the realm of the mundane, that is the physical world; (2) traveling to the super- natural; and (3) returning to the world of the mun- dane. The transition between the world of the mun- dane and the supernatural world is frequently facil- itated by inducing trance states using psychoactive plants, chanting, self-mutilation, sensory depriva- tion, sleep deprivation, ritual dancing, and/or fast- ing (Boyd 1996; Dobkin de Rios 1976; Harer 1973,1980; Joralemon 1984; Lewis-Williams and Villa Ahumada N 0 km 40 km Dowson 1988; Narby and Huxley 2001; Robicsek 1978:47). Once in trance, the spiritual essence of the shaman is transformed, leaves his body (most shamans are male), often in the form of an animal or a human with the characteristics of an animal or bird, and departs the world of the here-and-now for the spirit world (Dobkin de Rios 1976:61-62,73). As he journeys to the spirit world, the shaman fre- quently experiences the sensation of flying (Harer 1973:xxi; Whitley 2000:23). Upon arriving in the spiritual world the shaman communes with super- natural beings, bringing them gifts and prayers from his people, in order to gain their help and knowledge for healing, divination, successful hunts, weather control, and other benefits includ- 698 [Vol. 68, No. 4, 2003</page><page sequence="5">SHAMAN-PRIESTS OF CASAS GRANDES ing his own empowerment (Bawden 1996:70, Eli- ade 1964; Furst 1968,1998; Grim 1983; Joralemon and Sharon 1993; Myerhoff 1976,1978; Robicsek 1978; Whitley 2000; Wilbert 1987). Using the knowledge gained from the supernatural, the shaman either completes important tasks while in trance (such as helping with a difficult pregnancy), secures a promise for some important resource such as rain, or returns with the knowledge necessary to complete tasks in the mundane world (Bawden 1996:70; Grim 1983; Sharon 1993:165-169; Whit- ley 2000:28-29). Because shamans travel between the spirit world and the world of the mundane, they are liminal people who, in the words of Myerhoff (1976:103), "are at the thresholds of form, forever betwixt and between." The transition to and from the spirit world requires that they have "exquisite balance, never becoming too closely tied to the mundane or the supernatural" (Myerhoff 1976:99-100). Wilbert (1987:156) has argued that shamans derive their power from their ability to metaphorically "die," allowing their spirit to leave this world and to travel to the other world (see also Boyd 1996:156; Eli- ade 1964). They then defy death, successfully res- urrecting themselves when they return. As a result, the shamanic journey is a recurring "rite of passage" between the living and the dead (Myerhoff 1976:104-106). Turner (1969) argues that all rites of passages are full of dangers. Consequently, the rites associated with shamans are elaborated with rituals and symbols to ensure safe passage between the worlds (e.g., Bawden 1996:65-75; Sharon 1993:166-168). Often animal tutelary spirits, fre- quently in the form of birds, are sent with the shamans to guide and aid them during their flights (Bawden 1996:65-70; Harer 1973; Sharon 1993; Wilbert 1987). Shamanism and Tobacco in the Americas Shamans have been documented throughout the Americas from the time of European contact and have been studied ethnographically among a wide variety of groups (e.g., Eliade 1964; Joralemon and Sharon 1993:4-12; Loftin 1986; Robicsek 1978; Whitley 2000; Wilbert 1987; Winter 2000). They have also been identified among archaeologically and ethnographically studied groups ranging in political complexity from hunter-gatherers to state- level societies such as the Aztec (Bawden 1996:67; Boyd 1996, 1999; Brown 1997:475; Dobkin de Rios 1976:34; Eliade 1964; Friedel et al. 1993; Furst 1968, 1972, 1998; Grim 1983; Hamer 1973; Schaafsma 1994; Sharon 1993; von Gernet 2000:78; Whitley 2000). Shamans often use psychoactive drugs to induce ritual trances (Dobkin de Rios 1976; Furst 1972; Harer 1973; Wilbert 1987; Winter 2000). Most are plants derived from a few families, especially the alkaloid-rich Solanaceae or nightshade family, which includes tobacco (Nicotiana spp.) (Schultes and Hofmann 1979; Wilbert 1987:137). Historical, ethnographic, and pharmacological studies demon- strate that tobacco is hallucinogenic when taken in large doses (Joralemon 1984; Schultes and Hof- mann 1979:172-75; von Geret 1992, 2000:74; Wilbert 1987:1-148). When taken in extreme doses, it causes the heart rate to lower so much that it cannot be easily detected and renders the smoker catatonic, causing the body to become rigid (Wilbert 1987:142, 157-158). For all practical pur- poses the shaman appears dead, a state attributed to the shaman physically leaving his body (Wilbert 1987:157-158). Although the specific use of tobacco varied greatly from group to group, tobacco has been one of the most important and widely used psychoactive plants consumed by New World shamans (Brown 1997:474; Huckell 1998; Switzer 1969:1; Whitley 2000; Wilbert 1987; Winter 2000). It is believed to be one of the first plants used to initiate ecstasy trances in the New World, and it is associated with pipe ceremonialism and bird imagery in groups throughout the Americas (von Geret 1992:137,2000:79-80; Wilbert 1987:184). It was and still is consumed in a number of ways such as chewing, licking, eating, snuffing, and ene- mas, although smoking was the most common means of ingestion; Wilbert (1987:124, 141) found that in 233 of the 300 South American groups he studied who used tobacco, smoking was the most effective and preferred form of consumption. One of the earliest iconographic representations of tobacco smoking is found among the Maya, who smoked cigars (Robicsek 1978). Classic (A.D. 300-900) Maya art has many depictions of lords and gods smoking cigars (Friedel et al. 1993; Miller and Taube 1993:169; Robicsek 1978). According to the Popol Vuh (the Mayan creation story), shaman-priest rulers smoked and chewed tobacco, deprived themselves of sleep, fasted, and continu- Christine S.

Tobacco also has a long history of use in the American Southwest (Adams 1990; Huckell 1998:73; Switzer 1969; Winter 2000). Two pit- houses at the Stone Pipe Site in the Tucson Basin in southeastern Arizona (800 B.C.-A.D. 150) yielded 101 tobacco seeds (Huckell 1998). One structure also contained an unusually long pipe (15.6 cm) and produced a radiocarbon date of over 2000 B.P. (Ferg 1998:595; Huckell 1998:73). Another early site (Basketmaker III, A.D. 621-660), in the Prayer Rock District of north- eastern Arizona, had several pipes with nicotine residues, a Lino Gray jar containing well-preserved tobacco remains, and yucca leaf packets contain- ing tobacco and lime (Jones and Morris 1960). Lime (calcium carbonate) is commonly used in tobacco mixtures to increase the hallucinogenic effects of the nicotine (Wilbert 1987:18). Contin- ued use of tobacco is evident throughout the remainder of southwestern prehistory (Adams 1990; Switzer 1969; Winter 2000:41-53) and it is still used by modem Pueblo groups, the Akimel O'odham (Pima), and Tohono O'odham (Papago) (Loftin 1991:38; Parsons 1996:297 [1939]; Switzer 1969:13-15; Titiev 1992 [1944]:107; Winter 2000:41-46). Among the Pueblos, native tobacco smoke is considered sacred and is perhaps the most common form of prayer for men, an activity open to all ini- tiated males (Loftin 1986, 1991; Parsons 1996:370-373 [1939]). Most Pueblo groups, as well as the Akimel O'odham and Tohono O'odham, believe gods inhale the odor and essence (spiritual dimension) of the smoke. If offered with a good heart, and if the associated ceremonies and prayers are done correctly, the people will be rewarded with the blessing of rain, fertility, and health (Loftin 1991:38; see also Parsons 1996:172 [1939]; Titiev 1992:107 [1944]; Winter 2000:41-46). When Pueblo men smoke and pray for rain (Loftin 1986:181, 1991:38; Parsons 1996:370-373 [1939]; Stevenson 1985:189 [1904]; Winter 2000:44-45) they can embody a "spark of the sacred, and at proper times, align that embodied essence with the sacred itself in order to participate in the rhythms of their cosmos" (Loftin 1991:38-39). Smoking and repeating the rhythms of the cosmos through dance and other activities thus connect Pueblo men to supernatural beings. Iconographic evidence indicates that South American and Mesoamerican shaman-priests were from the ruling class (Bawden 1996:65-70; Frei- del et al. 1993:33-38; Miller and Taube 1993:33-34; Townsend 1998:28); not all males communally participated in smoking and prayer to contact the supernatural as was the case among most Southwestern groups. Furthermore, Meso- american shamans contacted the spiritual world by directly traveling to it during ecstasy trances, not indirectly through smoke and prayers (Winter 2000:41-55). For example, Mayan shaman "K'ul ahaw" or "divined lords" were able to travel between the worlds by opening a portal between them using the itz of the sky. Itz was "the magical stuff brought forth in ritual and as secretions from all sorts of things"-living and inanimate (Freidel et al. 1993:51, 411). In the world of the mundane it could be found as the sap of a tree or tears of the eyes (Freidel et al. 1993:411-412). Spiritual itz nourished and maintained humanity. Mayan shamans are often depicted in iconography as hav- ing jaguar elements such as jaguar skins on the face, and the legs or paws of the jaguars, indicat- ing that they themselves metamorphosed into anthropomorphic jaguars as part of the shamanic transformation (Furst 1968; Miller and Taube 1993:102-104, 152). Thus, these shaman-priests were divine leaders who transformed into super- natural jaguar beings, traveled between the worlds, and controlled the essences of all things (itz) dur- ing important rituals so that humankind continued to exist. Their spiritual power was also conceptu- alized as political power in the world of the mun- dane, thereby reinforcing their social status and legitimizing their leadership. Unlike Mesoamerican shaman-priests who were conceptualized as divine leaders and supernatural deities that ruled their societies, Pueblo ritual par- ticipants could be any initiated males with none conceived of as supernatural deities or divine rulers (Loftin 1986, 1991; Parsons 1996:370-373 [1939]; Winter 2000:44-45). Thus, spiritual power obtained by Pueblo shamans did not translate into divine leadership. I argue that Medio period (A.D. 1200-1450) Casas Grandes shamanism combines elements of 700 [Vol. 68, No. 4, 2003</page><page sequence="7">SHAMAN-PRIESTS OF CASAS GRANDES both Southwestern and Mesoamerican systems. Casas Grandes shaman-priests may have been sim- ilar to Pueblo, Akimel O'odham, and Tohono O'od- ham men in that they smoked tobacco and prayed for the blessing of rain, fertility, and health, as well as to connect with their supernatural entities. How- ever, Casas Grandes shaman-priests are similar to those from Mesoamerican groups in that they are depicted transforming into supernatural deities. Based on iconographic and archaeological evi- dence, I argue that the structure of ritual and polit- ical leadership was more similar to the established Mesoamerican trend of hierarchical shamanic lead- ership, in which the shaman-priests were consid- ered rulers who wielded enormous secular and spiritual power. Casas Grandes Regional Ceremonial Center: Paquime The Casas Grandes archaeological culture reached its broadest distribution during the Medio period (A.D. 1200-1450), encompassing northern Mex- ico, southeastern Arizona, southern New Mexico, and westernmost Texas (LeBlanc 1986:116-118; Ravesloot 1998; Schaafsma and Riley 1999a:5-8) (Figure 1). It is characterized by the formation of large aggregated communities, such as Paquime (formally called Casas Grandes) and Galeana, and the production of Chihuahuan polychromes, red- and-black-painted ceramics on a light tan-to-brown paste or slip (Phillips 1989:382-383). Smaller com- munities and villages are found within the region as well in a variety of topographical locales from flood plains to cliff and rock shelters high in the Sierra Madre Occidental (Gamboa 2002; Kelley et al. 1999; MacWilliams 2001; Phillips 1989:383; Schaafsma and Riley 1999b:237-239; Whalen and Minnis 2001b). Measuring 1 km in diameter, Paquime was both the largest Casas Grandes site and the site with the most apparent ritual architecture including two large I-shaped ball courts, a T-shaped ball court, platform mounds of various shapes and sizes, and a wide range of ritual rooms (Brown 1998; Di Peso 1974; Fish and Fish 1999:40; Lekson 1999a:15; Narez 1991; Phillips 1989:382; Wilcox 1995). Di Peso (1974, 1977) argued that Paquime was a regional economic and social center ruled by pochteca traders where specialists produced numerous goods including exotic birds and poly- chrome pottery for trade (also see Brown 1998:65; Douglas 1992; Minnis 1988; Phillips 1989:384; VanPool and Leonard 2002; Woosley and Olinger 1993). Di Peso (1974:418), Rakita (2001), and Ravesloot (1988:25-28) have demonstrated that Paquime had a hierarchical social organization that was reflected in mortuary practices. Paquime is unique to the region, having much more ceremo- nial architecture and apparent ritual artifacts and contexts when compared to other large sites like Galeana, which measures 1 km by .3 km and is in the neighboring Rio Santa Maria drainage (VanPool et al. 2000; see also Whalen and Minnis 2001a). Minnis and Whalen (1995, see also Whalen and Minnis 1996, 1999, 2001b:161-167) recently argued that Paquime exerted a strong influence over an area just 30 km in size, and its interaction with surrounding communities is best typified by peer polity competition. Others argue that Paquime's sphere of influence was much greater (Braniff 1999:82; Gamboa 2002; Hendrickson 2000:17; Narez 1991:17; Schaafsma and Riley 1999a:8-9). Regardless of the nature of its influence, Paquime was the "heart" of the Casas Grandes culture (Phillips 1989:383) and was a "Ceremonial City" (Lekson 1999a:15; see also Braniff 1999; Schaaf- sma 2000). Fish and Fish (1999:40) have proposed that Paquime may have been the "destination of regional pilgrimages, serving to ideologically rein- force and unite outlying populations" (see also Schaafsma 2000). The significant investment of labor in the construction of monumental architec- ture that includes 18 platform mounds and spe- cially shaped rooms indicates a community-wide emphasis on ritual activity (Fish and Fish 1999; Lekson 1999a; Schaafsma 2000). It is also clear that shell species and shell orna- ment styles, copper bells, and macaws found in large quantities at Paquime are from the Colima, Jalisco, and Nayarit coastal regions of West Mex- ico, suggesting that Paquime imported West Mex- ican prestige goods (Bradley 1996:iii; Braniff 1993:77; Di Peso et al. 1974; Foster 1995; Kelley 1980, 1986, 1993, 1995; Lekson 1999a; McGuire 1986:25; Vargas 2001:209) as well as symbols of power such as the feathered serpent icon (Braniff 1993:77,82; Kelley 1986:84-85; Schaafsma 2000). The presence of these trade items and symbols at Paquime has led researchers to argue for a cultural connection with the people as well (Bradley Christine S. VanPool] 701</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 2000:238; Braniff 1993; Schaafsma 1997:91; Turner 1999:232; Vargas 2001:207-209). These items and turquoise from the American Southwest are argued to be part of a West Mexican political prestige economy that enabled select individuals to elevate their political and social prestige (Bradley 1996; Braniff 1993:82, 1999; Lekson 1999b; McGuire 1986:251). Helms (1988, 1998) argues that elites obtain goods and knowledge from dis- tant lands to empower themselves and legitimize their knowledge of the sacred. The West Mexican prestige goods at Paquime came from a consider- able distance over the Sierra Madres, indicating that the developing elites at Paquime legitimized their social position by importing goods and knowl- edge from West Mexico (see also Braniff 1993; Kel- ley 1986; Lekson 1999b; McGuire 1986). Ball courts (I-shaped and T-shaped) that are morphologically similar to those used in Mesoamerica are further evidence for Mesoamer- ican influence at Paquime (Braniff 1999:82; Di Peso 1974; Harmon 2002; Naylor 1995; Schaaf- sma 2000; Whalen and Minnis 1996; Wilcox 1991). Ballgames served important religious, political, and economic roles (Braniff 1993: 79-80; Miller and Taube 1993:42-43; Santley et al. 1991; Schele and Freidel 1990; Whalen and Minnis 1996; Wilcox 1995:289-292). All three ball courts at Paquime had a center hole in the court covered with a stone. These holes have been interpreted to be an axis mundi, which is the symbolic emergence place from the underworld and the passageway between the worlds in Mesoamerican cosmology (also see Miller and Taube 1993:42-44; Wilcox and Stem- berg 1983:209). Di Peso (1974:414-415) argued that the T-shaped ball court in particular was a "reli- gious" court based on three subfloor caches of "sac- rificial" burials. One individual, for example, was buried with her severed right arm draped over her shoulders (Di Peso 1974:414). The House of the Walk-in Well was another important ritual area in Paquime (see VanPool 2001; Walker and MaGahee 2001). The well was a hidden subterranean water source in the center of the city with limited access and perhaps served as a center for rituals related to water (Di Peso 1974:356; Di Peso et al. 1974:4:377). To descend into the Walk-in Well, one passed a human skull- cap embedded in the floor of the entrance (Di Peso et al. 1974:4:372-81; Walker and MaGahee 2001). Economically valuable artifacts and ritual para- phernalia such as copper tinklers, small stone effi- gies, and turquoise and shell beads were strewn along the stairs leading down into the well (Di Peso et al. 1974:377-81). These items may have been ritual offerings to water deities or items used dur- ing ceremonies conducted for rain (Walker and MaGahee 2001).2 In addition to architectural traits and goods from West Mexico, the Casas Grandes region is charac- terized by finely made and intricately decorated polychrome vessels (Brown 1998:68). These ves- sels included effigies of human males and females, macaws, owls, snakes, badgers, fish, lizards, and large animals such as mountain sheep, which often bear a striking resemblance to Mesoamerican imagery (Braniff 1993:77; Kelley 1986:84-85). The effigy vessels are detailed enough to allow the determination of the sex of human figures and the specific species of some animals (VanPool 2001). Rinaldo (in Di Peso et al. 1974:6:86) argued that eccentric vessels (e.g., cruciform and triangu- lar forms) and effigy vessels were used for ritual activities based on analogies with historic groups and on contextual data from Paquime. He found that 55 of 69 eccentric and effigy vessels were unsooted with no evidence of usewear. Effigy ves- sels therefore provide an ideal place to begin study- ing Casas Grandes symbolism, because they are fairly realistic representations of humans and ani- mals but also likely reflect significant symbolism, themes, and ritual activities (see also Braniff 1999). As such, they provide symbolic information in a less ambiguous manner than abstract designs. Casas Grandes Male Effigy Pots During my analysis of Casas Grandes iconography, I examined 35 female effigies and 45 male effigies; of the latter, 22 are effigies of smoking males. Four of the smokers have provenience information; two are from the site of Paquime (Di Peso 1974:570), one is from Dutch Ruin in southern New Mexico (Lekson 2000:279, 284), and the other is from a small roomblock near the site of Galeana, 55 km southeast of Paquime (Figure 1). The remainder are unprovenienced. Di Peso (1974:570) and Woosley (2001:177- 178) suggest that the smoker effigies are represen- tations of shamans. All the smokers are male as evi- dent from their genitalia (see also Di Peso 702 [Vol. 68, No. 4, 2003</page><page sequence="9">SHAMAN-PRIESTS OF CASAS GRANDES 1974:715). They are depicted in various squatting (including kneeling) positions (Color Photo 1, p. 709), with their right knees (or less frequently, both knees) flexed to their chest, a position com- mon for male effigies but never found among female effigies with a single exception.3 In my sam- ple, 21 of the 22 smokers have the right knee flexed to the chest with the right elbow resting on the right knee and the right hand placed in front of the mouth, holding the pipe, usually between the thumb and index finger. The remaining smoker is left-handed, and thus has his body position reversed so that his left hand holds the pipe and his left knee is drawn to the chest. By Western standards the squatting position would be uncomfortable and may reflect a com- mon shamanic practice of adopting an uncomfort- able stance; ethnographically studied shamans hold uncomfortable positions, such as squatting on their heels for long periods of time, to show their bal- ance and strength (Meyerhoff 1976:102). A strik- ingly similar pose is seen in "crouching male smoker Ixtlan del Rio figures" from the Nayarit area of West Mexico (Di Peso 1974:570; see Furst 1998:168 for an image of such a smoker). They too have their legs flexed very close to their bodies, hold pipes, and have painted interlocking step motifs and squiggly lines (rain symbols) similar to those seen on some of the Casas Grandes smokers. While many designs such as similar clothing and facial markings are found on both male and female effigies, two motifs are limited to male effigies, smoker effigies, dancers, and anthropomorphic fig- ures painted onjars. These motifs are isolated small circles with a central dot and pound signs with or without a central dot. What these motifs might symbolize is unknown, but they could be tattoos,4 images of self mutilation, or self flogging,5 all of which are known to be used by shamans to help induce altered states. Regardless of their meanings, I argue that the redundancy and co-occurrence of these two symbols on these individuals indicate that the kneelers, smokers, and painted individuals are members of the same group. Five kneelers and ten smokers are depicted with either the pound signs or the dotted circles (e.g., Color Photo lb; see also Figure 163 from Woosley 2001:177), and one smoker effigy has both of these symbols. Like the smoker effigies, painted indi- viduals frequently have one of the two key motifs. Seven jars with painted individuals have been recorded. On six of these jars, the painted individ- uals have either the pound signs on both the chest and legs, or the pound signs on their chest and small circles on the legs or stomach. In contrast to their frequency on male effigies and on painted figures, only two additional pots in my sample of over 2,000 Chihuahuan polychromes have a pound sign; one is an eye decoration in a homed serpent motif and the second is on the vulva of a female effigy pot. The small dotted circles are on 31 vessels painted with geometrics, besides the smoker effigies and the vessels with painted figures. The painted figures with pound signs and small dotted circles are frequently depicted in odd pos- tures that may represent dancing movements. They are associated with hored/plumed serpent imagery and headdresses that appear to be adorned with macaw feathers.6 These attributes suggest the indi- viduals are involved in ceremonial activities. For example, a Ramos Polychrome jar (Color Photo 2, p. 709) depicts two sets of two individuals with pound signs and small circles with dots. Both fig- ures wear headdresses and are in bent postures sug- gesting they are performing a dance or another important ritual activity. Additionally, the painted dancers with head- dresses are not depicted wearing leggings or with the facial markings observed on the smokers. As part of their rituals, Casas Grandes shamans may have discarded their clothing and facial markings to indicate their disconnection to the world of the mundane and their usual identity when they began their journey to the spirit world, a common prac- tice during liminal ceremonies (Turner 1969). Images of individuals wearing horned or plumed serpent headdress are not unique to the Casas Grandes region. Similar human figures wearing horned/plumed serpent headdresses that may have been involved in ritual activity are illustrated on three Mimbres Black-on-white bowls (ca. A.D. 1000-1100) from southwestern New Mexico, and a kiva mural from Pottery Mound (ca. A.D. 1300-1500) in central New Mexico (Figure 2). Unlike the Casas Grandes figures, two of the Mim- bres figures are shown possibly decapitating a male (Figure 2a, b), but the other one has an odd stance suggestive of dance movements (Figure 2c) (Brody 1977:15).

Drawing of a Ramos Polychrome jar from the House of the Walk-in-Well (redrawn from Di Peso et al. 1974:6:272). ilar hored/plumed serpent headdress/mask, but due to poor preservation it is difficult to determine what activities he or she is conducting (Figure 2d). The Casas Grandes painted human in Figure 3 closely resembles the figures illustrated in Color Photo 2 in that he has pound signs on his chest. Instead of wearing a homed/plumed-serpent head- dress, his headdress is shown next to him and he has ahom (see also VanPool 2002:43 for additional image). This image suggests the individual is trans- forming into a homed being and is metamorphos- ing into what he represented while wearing the headdress (see Loftin 1991). In addition, Furst (1998:178-181) argues that shamans throughout the Americas including the Colima, Jalisco, and Nayarit areas in West Mexico are depicted with horns protruding from the forehead, demonstrat- ing their power. The hored men in Casas Grandes iconography may therefore further indicate a cul- tural linkage with West Mexico. Thus, individuals decorated with the pound sign and small circles with a central dot are depicted smoking, dancing, and transforming into super- natural beings. The transformation of these indi- viduals depicted in the imagery is akin to that seen in other New World shamans, especially the "full blown tobacco shamans" of South America and the Huichol (West Mexican) (Wilbert 1987; Winter 2000:266). By following the pound sign on the shamans, we can further trace the shamanic jourey and trans- formation of the shamans into supernatural deities who cross over to the spirit world. Figure 4 shows two roll-out drawings from a Ramos Polychrome bowl (Di Peso 1974:534-535). Each of the indi- viduals on this bowl has pound signs on his chest and a macaw head, and both appear to be flying. They carry hored serpents/macaws under their left arms, while a bird rides along with them on top of their left legs. Given their iconographic context, that the shamans are depicted with birds is not surprising. As previously mentioned, birds are common tute- lary animals among New World shamans (von Ger- net 1992, 2001;Wilbert 1987). Both von Geret (1992:137,2001:80) and Wilbert (1987:184) have argued for an association of bird imagery and tobacco as ubiquitous, indicating it is a physiolog- ical and biochemical reaction from nicotine intox- ication, which causes people to "see" flashes of movement that are commonly interpreted as birds while in trance (Wilbert 1987:133-148). The birds and the hored/plumed serpents may be tutelary spirits who guide the shaman through his jouney and help him bring back critical information or per- form tasks while in the spirit world (see Bawden 1996; Grim 1983; Harer 1973; Joralemon and Sharon 1993). Only two other vessels with macaw-headed anthropomorphs have been recorded. The macaw- headed anthropomorph is associated with the tute- lary bird on one of the vessels and with the hored/plumed serpent on the other. Neither of these individuals is wearing clothes, as seen in the earlier phase of the shamanic journey. When the vessels are viewed as a continuum (Figure 5), they present a depiction of the classic shamanic journey. The Casas Grandes shamanic jourey begins in the mundane world as depicted by "kneelers and smokers" who may have been Christine S. VanPool] 705</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 4. Drawings of a Ramos Polychrome bowl (redrawn from Di Peso 1974:535, 536). smoking tobacco perhaps laced with datura or pey- ote. As the Casas Grandes shamans begin to leave the mundane world, they lose their ordinary identi- ties as indicated by the loss of their clothes and facial markings. On one vessel they are clearly shown with their arms in the air, suggesting they are about to begin their "flight" (see Fields and Zamu- dio-Taylor 2001:44, Figure 18). They also begin to transform into supernatural beings, as illustrated in Figure 3, in which the shaman is becoming a horned being, not just a person wearing a headdress. The macaw-headed individuals illustrate the complete transformation. They have lost their human identity and have become supernatural entities. While the shamans are clearly depicted as trans- Figure 5. Schematic of the Casas Grandes shamanic jour- ney. formed supernatural entities and are shown in flight (Figure 4), their arrival in the supernatural world is more clearly illustrated in Figure 6. This figure is a roll-out drawing of a jar portraying macaw- headed humans with tail feathers and pound signs on their chests interacting with supernatural enti- ties including the horned/plumed serpent, a macaw design that I refer to as the "double-headed dia- mond macaw" and the tutelary bird, which was depicted with the traveling shaman in Figure 4. The pound signs again indicate that these anthropo- morphic figures are the transformed shamans. Additionally, the vessel's design lacks the highly structured layout typical of other Casas Grandes ceramics. Most Casas Grandes polychromejars are decorated on the sides; rarely are they decorated on the bottom (Brooks 1973:11). Usually there are two decorative panels, one on each side of the jar (Brooks 1973:11; Kidder 1916:261; VanPool and VanPool 2002). These are often subdivided into four triangular panels (Hendrickson 2000:36; Kid- der 1916:261-262). In contrast, the vessel repre- sented in Figure 6 has been painted on part of the bottom, and the sides of this vessel have not been divided into panels. There is little "empty space" on the pot, and it is iconographically complex com- pared to other vessels. (Three additional vessels have similar macaw-headed imagery, one of which is on display at the El Paso Museum of Archaeol- 706 [Vol. 68, No. 4, 2003</page><page sequence="13">SHAMAN-PRIESTS OF CASAS GRANDES Figure 6. Roll-out of a Ramos Polychrome jar (adapted from Justin Kerr, New York, Photograph No. K1548). ogy at Wilderness Park and is used as the museum's logo. These vessels also flaunt the highly struc- tured Casas Grandes layout and are painted on the bottom.) The intentional abandonment of the nor- mal Chihuahuan polychrome design layout may indicate that the structure of the mundane world is gone. Thus, the layout and the supernatural deities illustrate that the shaman traveled to "the underly- ing chaos of the unconceptualized domain which has not yet been made a part of the cosmos by the cultural activity of naming and defining" (Myer- hoff 1976:102), or, to use Turner's (1969) term, they reached antistructure. Their successful return from this realm is illustrated by the fact that their jour- ney is portrayed on these ceramics. Additional Interpretations Most researchers studying symbolism agree that symbols have multiple meanings (Hodder 1986; Leone 1986; Robb 1998, 1999). This is true of the imagery discussed here. For example, some of the imagery could reflect general death symbolism, with the horizontal individuals represented in Fig- ure 4 representing dying individuals who have lost their humanism as seen with the loss of clothing, and have transformed into a spirit. The horizontal figures could reflect individuals who are in the lim- inal state between mundane and spirit worlds. The arrival of the deceased individual into the spirit world is marked by his association with the horned/plumed serpents and double-headed dia- mond macaw motif, two important deities in Casas Grandes cosmology (Figure 6). Such an interpre- tation is consistent with both the imagery in gen- eral and the arguments presented above. As previously mentioned, shamans undertaking the shamanic journey are general conceptualized as individuals who die, thereby allowing their spirits to travel into the spirit world. The difference between shamanic death and an individual's ultimate death is that the shaman's spirit is able to return to the world of the mundane, inhabit his body, and in effect allow the shaman to be resurrected. It is in fact the shaman's ability to "conquer" death that contributes to shamans' high social status and perceived spiritual strength (Myer- hoff 1976; Wilbert 1987:157). It is unlikely, however, that Casas Grandes death symbolism is indicative of general deaths. The use of the pound signs and circles with a limited group of males indicates that the symbolism does not apply to females or even most males. Thus, it does not represent death for all Casas Grandes individ- uals. Furthermore, the association of the horned ser- pent imagery, commonly associated with water rituals in Mesoamerica and the American South- west (Schaafmsa 1980,1998:41,2000), with males dancing and smoking from pipes (cloud blowers), strongly insinuates that individuals are conducting water rituals (Loftin 1986, 1991; Titiev 1992:107 [1944]; Winter 2000:41-46), and are not under- taking the general passage of individuals from liv- ing to dead. This portion of the symbolism therefore appears to be tied to rain making and probably does not represent the general process of death. Although the horizontal figures themselves could represent at one level the general process of death, the smok- ers and dancers represent water rituals at a differ- ent level. The pound signs and circles on the horizontal figures, the smokers, and the dancers, however, suggest that the two levels of potential meanings are tied together. General shamanic sym- Christine S. VanPool] 707</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY bolism can account for each level of the symbol- ism while at the same time explain how the spe- cific meanings such as death and water rituals may be tied together. One reviewer for this paper also suggested that the dancers with homed serpent headdresses could represent kachinas (Color Photo 2). This is a dis- tinct possibility given that hored serpents and kachinas are often used together in water rituals in many Pueblos of the Southwest (Bunzel 1992:515-516; Schaafsma and Wiseman 1992:179; Stevenson 1985 [1904]; Titiev 1992 [1944]; Tyler 1991:20-21; Wright 1985:50-51). If these dancers are kachinas they may represent ancestors just as they do among the Pueblo people today (Hieb 2000; Wright 1985:2). If so, then the shamanic practice is again symbolically tied to death and the other world (see Hieb 2000:25 for the association of kachinas and death). These dancers with homed serpent head- dress could be ancestors and shamans at the same time. In the Mayan World, shamans/divine leaders were considered to be the incarnated ancestors (Miller and Taube 1993:32). Thus Casas Grandes art could have multiple meanings integrating ances- tors, kachinas, and shamans. If these figures seen in Color Photo 2 are kachi- nas then they might be an early form that is struc- turally different from those found prehistorically and historically among the Pueblos to the north. In Casas Grandes iconography the individuals are wearing headdresses instead of masks. This may be a moot point that is significant only to Western thinking, but it could also reflect a difference in the religious systems; Cole (1989) and Adams (2000:35) both argue that masks are "the only reli- able indicator" of kachinas. Additionally, the plethora of kachinas present elsewhere (e.g., the Sun Kachina and the Deer Kachina) are not evi- dent in the Casas Grandes system, which instead emphasizes the horned serpent imagery specifi- cally. As a result, it seems unlikely that the Casas Grandes system can be strictly modeled using anal- ogy with the Puebloan cultures of the American Southwest, although they may have shared many common threads. Discussion Two motifs, the pound signs and circles, are found on male kneeler effigies, male smoker effigies, painted dancers, and painted supernatural entities, but with two exceptions are not found on female effigies or other Casas Grandes ceramic vessels. In particular, the pound sign is found on three male kneelers, six smokers, five dancers, and five anthro- pomorphic figures with human bodies and horned or macaw heads, suggesting these individuals are part of a discrete group. This demonstrates that Casas Grandes males participated in the "classical three-part shamanic journey" and were shamans in the anthropological sense (see Myerhoff 1976; Sharon 1993). The shamans smoked tobacco, which could have been combined with other pow- erful drugs such as datura and peyote alkaloids, as observed among many groups in South America (Wilbert 1987), the Huichol of West Mexico (Furst 1972, 1998; Myerhoff 1978) and the moder-day Tarahumara in the Casas Grandes region (Winter 2000:50-52), and danced, aided by prayer, medi- tation, fasting, sleep deprivation and auto-violence, to induce an ecstasy trance. While in trance they were conceptualized as being dead, with their spir- its leaving the world of the mundane and traveling to the "other" world in the form of macaw-headed anthropomorphs. They then communed with supernaturals and finally returned to the mundane, defying death. The pipes held by Casas Grandes smoker effi- gies appear to be small cylinders that are similar to nine stone pipes found at Paquime. Seven of the pipes were found in the side rooms of the House of the Walk-in Well (Di Peso et al. 1974:7:305- 306), along with two "shamanic caches" (jars with mineral concretions, quartz, and small fetishes), and a large jar with depictions of two shamans. The pipes indicate that smoking was an important part of the actual ritual behavior at Paquime, not just an activity portrayed on pots. Given the contexts of the pipes, the shamanic caches, and the olla deco- rated with shamans, it is plausible to conclude that shamans used the House of the Walk-in Well while engaged in smoking rituals. If so, then the smok- ing, pipes, shaman caches, and shamanic iconog- raphy at the House of the Walk-in Well constitute an "iconic family" that according to Knight (1986:676) is a "set of sacra particularly associ- ated with a corresponding cult institution." This cult institution at Paquime was in all likelihood concerned with water making or rejuvenation, given the context of the Walk-in Well. The journey depicted on these Casas Grandes 708 [Vol. 68, No. 4, 2003</page><page sequence="15">SHAMAN-PRIESTS OF CASAS GRANDES Color Photo 1. Smoker effigies.

Photograph by Chris Coleman). pots strongly suggests the presence of smoking shamanism in the Casas Grandes region. The pres- ence of the seven pipes, at least two smoker effi- gies, the shamanic caches, and a vessel depicting shamans (Figure 3) in the rooms of the House of the Walk-in Well, indicate that this shamanic ide- ological system was well formulated at Paquime and was an integrated component of the practiced ritual system. If Fish and Fish (1999:44) and Schaafsma (2000) are correct that people in the Casas Grandes region undertook pilgrimages to Paquime, the shamans of Paquime may have had tremendous political and spiritual significance. As a ritual center, the shamans at Paquime may have been considered to be very powerful, causing peo- ple to come from far and wide for cures, predic- tions, or prayers for rain and crops. In addition to the two motifs that are effectively limited to the shamans, the smokers are decorated with other symbols. Of importance to this discus- sion is that the smokers are sometimes (4 of 22) depicted with sashes that are composed of running bands of dotted circles (Color Photo 3). This same banding, depicted on female effigies (6 of 35) and other male effigies (6 of 20), is commonly used to depict the bodies of serpents on 8 of 33 vessels with serpents (Color Photo 4; for additional images see Lekson 2002:28, Figure 2.18; Narez 1991:5). I argue elsewhere (VanPool 2000) that this banding is a shorthand expression for a serpent. "In religious 710 [Vol. 68, No. 4, 2003</page><page sequence="17">SHAMAN-PRIESTS OF CASAS GRANDES Color Photo 4. Ramos Polychrome snake effigy vessel (courtesx of the El Paso Centennial Musenm, University of Texas at El Paso, Catalog No. A 36.1.91). terms, serpents may have been the most important fauna of Mesoamerica," and they have been reported as having been a "pan-Mesoamerican 'vehicle of rebirth, and transformation"' (Miller and Taube 1993:148-150). Both Mesoamerican groups and various Southwestern groups believed that serpents come from the underworld, and their modem descendents still use live snakes in their cer- emonies (Crown 1994:167; Ellis and Hammack 1968:42; Miller and Taube 1993:197; Parsons 1996:709 [1939]; Titiev 1992:152 [1944]) (e.g., the Hopi consider serpents to be the messengers that carry prayers to the underworld [Loftin 1991; Tyler 1964]). The serpent band is also only rarely found as con- tinuous zigzag bands on pots decorated with geo- metric designs (Figure 7). Of the 238 Ramos Polychrome7 vessels excavated from Paquime, only three geometric vessels have this serpent band motif (Figure 7; Di Peso et al. 1974:6:250-299) (in my sam- ple of 2,000 pots this serpent band motif is present only on one additional olla, indicating that the motif is rarely present on geometric vessels). These vessels are between 40 and 50 cm tall and are found in impor- tant ritual contexts: one in the House of the Walk-in Well and two at the Mound of the Offerings. The vessel from the House of the Walk-in Well (41.4 cm tall) has depictions of two "horned" shamans (Figure 3), indicating an association of shamans and serpent imagery. The other two large jars (40.0 and 46.8 cm tall, respectively) from the Mound of the Offerings are Ramos Polychrome vessels that contained postcranial human remains. Di Peso (1974:418) and Ravesloot (1988:25-28) argued that these urns contained the most elite buri- als at Paquimd, and recent research by Rakita (2001) reveals that the bodies of these elites were revisited and venerated during rituals. The associ- ation of serpent banding with these individuals demonstrates that serpent symbolism was vital to the elites in their final resting place and was a sym- bol associated with the leadership at Paquime. The fact that the vessels from the House of the Walk-in Well had both serpent and shamanic imagery and was found in association with the pipes and the other shamanic paraphernalia suggests that serpent imagery was associated with shamans as well. The association of serpent symbolism with the elite Christine S. VanPool] 711</page><page sequence="18">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 7. Ramos Polychrome urn from Paquime (drawn from Ravesloot 1988:26). burials at Paquime suggests that the leaders are at the very least associated with the shamans, and that they may in fact be the same people. Schaafsma (2000) and Schaafsma and Riley (1999b:248) have argued that Casas Grandes may have had "caciques," who exercised religious authority. It seems highly likely that these caciques must have exercised some kind of political control (Schaafsma and Riley 1999b:248). The icono- graphic and archaeological analyses presented in this paper appear to support their suggestion, adding only that the religious leaders, who had political control, were shaman-priests. Local elites at Paquime may have followed a well-known Mesoamerican and South American strategy to obtain power by emphasizing their access to super- natural powers. In this way, they parlayed their spiritual power into political power as well. Helms (1988:3-5, 1998:3-11) argues that elites make long-distance journeys, both in the physical and spiritual worlds, to access exotic goods and knowl- edge and to thereby gain and legitimize their sta- tus in their own societies. In this context, the spiritual journey and esoteric knowledge of the shamans represents an "exotic" resource that included knowledge of the "mysteries" of the cos- mos that is even less accessible than exotic mater- ial goods (Helms 1988:5). It may have been the Paquime shaman-priests' perceived spiritual knowledge and power coupled with their access to exotic goods from West Mexico that led to the development of Paquime as a ritual center. As a result, shamanic leadership at Paquime was more indicative of the Mesoamerican pattern of leadership, a pattern that is very different than that of the Pueblo religious patterns, where all initiated males participate in smoking and repeating the rhythms of the cosmos through dance to connect to their supernatural beings (Loftin 1991:38). The argument that the pattern of shamanic ritual and leadership is indicative of Mesoamerican influence is further supported by the significant presence at Paquime of Mesoamerican traits such as I-shaped ball courts, shell species and shell ornament styles, and copper bells from West Mexico. Conclusions By tracing distinctive designs, the pound sign and the dotted circle, found on effigies of males kneel- ing and smoking, and on painted figures of men dancing, and macaw- and horned-headed humans, the "classic shamanic journey" observed cross-cul- turally is also observed in Casas Grandes iconog- raphy. As with all liminal rituals, the shamanic 712 [Vol. 68, No. 4, 2003</page><page sequence="19">SHAMAN-PRIESTS OF CASAS GRANDES passage was marked with important symbols and tutelary imagery that helped to ensure safe pas- sageways between the worlds (Joralemon and Sharon 1993; Turner 1969). In the case of the Casas Grandes region, shamans were depicted with ser- pent symbolism as seen in the serpent bands and horned/plumed serpent headdresses they wore, and with birds that aided them. The serpent symbolism on the elite burial urns at Paquime indicates that elites and shamans shared a similar symbolism and that the shamans may have been the institutional- ized elites. If so, the elites at Paquime were shamanic-priest leaders, suggesting that Paquime's social organization was more similar to the Mesoamerican system of shamanic leaders than the communal male religious practitioners in the American Southwest. By becoming supernatural entities themselves, Casas Grandes shamanic- priests were able to legitimize control over the social, political, and religious arenas as well as the natural and supernatural worlds. The determination that Casas Grandes leader- ship was based primarily on shamanic practices provides another example of shamanic-priest lead- ership in the New World before European contact. The growing number of New World cases of shamanic-priest leadership suggests that anthro- pologists should reconceptualize the roles of shamans and priests in the New World. They were often religious practitioners who wielded immense power and importance and who may have been fundamental in emerging complexity in past soci- eties throughout the Americas. Acknowledgments.

In this context, I use "shaman" as a generic term with no negative connotations. Recently there has been a debate concerning the appropriateness of the term "shaman" (Klein et al. 2002). While perhaps not ideal, I use the term as it has been defined cross-culturally. Given that I am dealing with a prehistoric society, there is no clear culturally appropriate alternative. 2. Di Peso (1974:356) argued that "ceremonial parapher- nalia" was thrown down into the well when Paquime was sacked and burned, and he stated "the hidden entry and the privacy of the subterranean room implied certain religious connotations that are not clear." 3. In my sample all but one of the females were sitting with their legs extended from their bodies (see also Woosley 2001:174). The only exception to this is a female who has both legs flexed to the chest. 4. Sprehn (2001) argues that facial decorations depicted on human effigy vessels may be tattoos. It is possible that some of the other body decorations on the human effigies such as the pound signs and circles are tattoos as well. 5. Schaafsma (2000) suggests that the pound signs might represent self-flogging. 6. Macaws were an important part of the Paquim6 ritual system. Over 500 macaws were found at Paquim6; more than 300 were sacrificed at one year of age (Di Peso et al. 1974:599).
