<plain_text><page sequence="1">Studies in the Philosophy of Religion, by A. A. Bowman. Two vols. Vol. i pp. xlviii + 423 ; vol. ii pp. xiii + 436. (Macmillan and Co., London, 1938.) By Prof. Bowman's lamented death at the early age of 53, British philosophy lost a student and teacher whom these two volumes, edited with a ' memorial introduction ' by the author's friend, Prof. Nor man Kemp Smith, shew to have been one from the thoroughness and independence of whose thinking much might have been expected, and who, even as it is, has left behind him in these Studies a remarkable and valuable contribution to the philosophy of religion. It is good VOL. XL.

In these days when so many acute minds among the younger generation of our philosophers are content to employ themselves wholly in what seem to some of us the arid fields of ' logical analysis ', it is refreshing to meet with a man not yet old who still recognized with Kant that the problems of ' God, freedom, and immortality ' were the proper business of philosophy. It is with the first and third of these that the work now before us is especially concerned. It is by no means easy reading; and it is obvious, as the editor points out in his preface, that the final chapter is, as it stands, ' briefer and less substantial than the preceding argument had led the reader to expect ', and ' would have been amplified had the author lived to super vise publication '. Prof. Bowman's method was to accumulate 'as extensive and as exact a knowledge as possible ' of the facts about religion as a pheno menon of human experience, and then to seek ' something beyond the facts ', of which they ' are thought to be the variable, and not always adequate, expression which he calls the ' defining concept ' of religion (p. 3). Although no attentive reader will doubt his familiarity with the philosophical literature relating to his subject, he does not develop his own argument by a criticism of the views of other philosophers, and there is a noticeable paucity of references to them. Names of writers whom the extracts from his letters given in Prof. Kemp Smith's intro duction shew to have especially impressed him, such as Augustine and Von Hugel, do not occur at all in his text. I observe, by the way, that in one of the few passages in which he does advert to the classical exponents of philosophical theory, he seems (unless I misunderstand his note, i p. 27) to attribute to Locke the discovery of a principle which lies at the base of the whole ' analogical ' theology of St Thomas and his school. ' At the very root of religion is the yearning for life ', says Prof. Bow man (i p. 200). Manifested from the first in the instinct of self preservation, this yearning is first ' raised to the level of reflection and there reaffirmed as a value-judgment upon existence' (i p. 421). Hence, in his view, the ' finite factor ' is essential to religion, which is ' cancelled ' by a pantheism for which the universe ' is all God ' or by a mysticism which aims at a union with God incompatible with con tinuing to be his worshipper. For our author, therefore, the two great historical religions which have originated in India represent, as compared with Christianity, what we may call a morbid deveiopement of man's religious nature. ' Brahmanism ', he tells us (i p. 423), ' is a religion</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 307 run to metaphysics, and contemptuous of works. In the Buddhism to which it gave birth works are all in all, and metaphysics is a delusion. . . . Brahmanism is the nemesis of Oriental religion ; Buddhism is the nemesis of Brahmanism.' Yet, although mysticism, according to our author, ' is the death of religionnevertheless 'all religion must be mystical' (ii p. 1). Only the mysticism thus implicit in religion must be checked by a firm conviction of the supreme value of personality. One of the most interesting features of Prof. Bowman's discussion is his examination of the ' steady drift towards a more or less impersonal interpretation of existence ' which he confesses to be 'a highly characteristic phenomenon of religion in its more advanced stages of development ' (ii p. 3). He considers, though only to reject it, the suggestion that religion ' may have to be considered a self-extinguishing, or, if the phrase be preferred, a self-transcending phenomenon ', like institutions which ' assume the form of a preparation for their own displacement', such as war and law (ii p. 4). On the contrary, that very ' movement towards the im personal' which lends plausibility to this suggestion is, in his view, a necessary step forward in the full realization of what is involved in that ' personality ' the recognition of which both in God and in man he holds to be essential to all religion that can rightly be so called. In the secularist attitude to life, by the prevalence of which the modern world is so markedly distinguished from that of earlier ages, and which seems to many likely in the end to leave no place at all for religion, Prof. Bowman sees a product of religion itself, which in its own interest has found it necessary to treat ' objects as objects ', since, when mere ' objects ' are treated as ' subjects ', they are apt at one stage of de velopement to be treated as gods (this is what we call idolatry), and therefore to ' put nature in its place ' instead of confounding it with God ; and also in like manner to distinguish, even among genuine ' subjects ', between man and God, instead of deifying humanity by anthropomorphism and thereby denying at once to man his power to ' do without God if he choose ' and his privilege of entering into a per sonal relation with One whom he can worship as a Being essentially superior to himself. A remark (i p. 53) to the effect that the Christian doctrine of a consubstantial trinity of persons in God is not of ' immediate urgency ', while the question ' whether God is a person' is 'of primary importance ', perhaps indicates that Prof. Bowman would not have agreed with some Christian thinkers that this doctrine makes the affirmation of per sonality in God easier by its implied denial that God is properly to be called ' a person ', and also by its suggestion that the personal relation between the worshipper and his God has its archetype and principle</page><page sequence="4">308 the journal of theological studies within the eternal life of God himself. However this may be, our author was convinced that without the recognition of personality in God religion must fail to accomplish its mission of delivering human life from the disease of subjectivity which appeared to him to afflict ' the world of to-day ' by giving to man an object ' not of interest merely, not of scientific or of aesthetic preoccupation, but of reverence' (ii p. 433). For, as Prof. Bowman had no hesitation in affirming as an unquestionable truth, 'the only possible object of reverence is a person '. The belief in immortality, for Prof. Bowman as for what is probably a majority among its thoughtful defenders in our time, must be based on the conviction that ' the supreme reality is personal in character '. ' Religion, which begins in a preoccupation with life, ends ', he says— quoting Rom. viii 38-39 in illustration of his words—' in a complete indifference to death' (ii p. 431). Death is indeed, he contends, neither the opposite of life nor its necessary end, but rather 'a normal function of life, when life itself becomes the function of an organized system of cells ' (ii p. 374)—for ' unicellular organisms do not die of their own accord : they divide and multiply' (ii p. 370). This process, however, has ' nothing to do with personality as such ' (ii p. 380) : yet our claim to be ' persons in a sense that admits of no qualification ' by the limits of our earthly experience is the presupposition, not of religion only, but of ' the whole organized life of humanity ', of ' science, art, norality, civilization' (ii p. 397). It is not to be denied that Prof. Bowman, in his defence of the belief in human immortality as a legitimate deduction from that in divine personality, has left many difficulties not only unsolved but undis cussed. For example, it may be asked of him, holding as he does that we never step out of time (i p. 418), how far we can conceive the individual stepping out of his own age, as the belief in his immortality seems to require. Nor has the present review touched upon many topics of interest which are suggested by the reading of this book. I have confined myself on the whole to such as, being of more directly theological interest, are specially appropriate to this Journal; and I have not dwelt even upon all of these. But enough has, I hope, been said to shew that the work before us is deserving of close and careful study by all who agree with its author in regarding religion as man's crowning experience, without which his life cannot be expected to attain to the order and harmony after which, whatever philosophical theories inconsistent with the justification of his aspiration he may embrace, his nature will still compel him to aspire.
