<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Slice of Delirium: Scorsese's Taxi Driver Revisited Leonard Quart Martin Scorsese's New York is, obviously, a much darker and more dangerous place than the safe, luminous one that plays such a central role in Woody Allen's films. There is, however, not one, but a number of New Yorks that are evoked in Scorsese's films. There is the 19th century upper class world of elaborate rituals and conspicuous luxury of The Age of Innocence and the city of painters' studios, jazz clubs, and art galleries of New York Stories. But the two that remain indel- ible are the circumscribed Italo-American neighborhood universe of bars, tenements, and stoops where "the boys" hang out and the night- mare nocturnal city of pimps, prostitutes, feral kids. Of the two, it is the latter city, whose ùrbanscape Scorsese (with the close collabora- tion of scriptwriter Paul Schräder) most vividly details in Taxi Driver that remains most memorable. And with each screening that vision turns out to contain richer and more ambiguous resonances than the facile rubric "nightmare city" allows for. The focus in Taxi Driver is both on a paranoid, solipsistic, strangely innocent and conventional cab driver, Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro), and the city he drifts about in. The film's New York contains no street festivals or familial celebrations, and Travis (shot in tight close-up and usually alone in the frame) is more alienated, closed-in, and solitary than any of the Italo-American "wise guys" that inhibit films like Mean Streets and Goodfellas. He has no church, family, or male buddies to 67</page><page sequence="2">give him solace. His fellow cab drivers are a disaffected, inarticulate lot, who engage in desultory, fragmented talk about who got cut up the night before, "fags," guns, and their own adolescent sexual fanta- sies. And the city he confronts is the nightmare New York where po- lice sirens constantly wail, steam rises from manhole covers, open hydrants spurt torrents of water into garbage-filled gutters, prostitutes in hot pants avidly look for customers, and madmen shout wildly in the street. Sitting all night in his enclosed space, behind a plexiglass parti- tion, Travis cruises the city picking up passengers like a call girl and her repellent, businessman John, and a tense, raging, cuckolded hus- band (Scorsese himself) with murderous fantasies about "blowing up his wife's pussy." While driving through the forbidding night streets his cab window is pelted with eggs by black street kids, and a stop at a bodega leads to his confronting and casually killing an armed rob- ber. The New York depicted here is out of control, and the oppressive summer humidity and heat that run through the film only reinforce the sensation of living in a rotting, rancid universe. Nevertheless, though Scorsese sees New York as conveying "a constant sense that the buildings are getting odd, things are breaking down" and "society is in a state of decay" (Thomson and Christie 60), his afflicted city can be seductive. If the city in Taxi Dríver seems in- habited primarily by the lost, the murderous, and the impoverished, there is something grotesquely beautiful about the neon-lit, eternally wet, crammed, sweltering streets~an urban hell which has its perverse attractions. The night streets turn out to be much more alluring than the bland, sterile, daytime avenues around Columbus Circle where Travis' unreachable, dream blond, Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), works for a soporific, liberal Presidential candidate's campaign. Scorsese is not really interested in the class gulf that exists be- tween Travis and Betsy, or about providing a social or political cri- tique of urban anomie and squalor. This is not a film which cares about cleaning up corruption, rehabilitating the broken and danger- ous, or creating a more just and coherent society. In fact, the one political voice in the film--the media ready Presidential candidate, Ralantine-offers nothing more than empty, harmless, populist bro- mides about "letting the people rule." Scorsese is even-handed in his treatment of the disaffected and malevolent. They consist here of a rainbow coalition of blacks, His- panics, and whites. Pimps are either self-satisfied, sinister black men in wide brimmed hats, wearing dark glasses, or a malevolent, muscu- lar, drug addicted white man, Sport (Harvey Keitel). None of these 68</page><page sequence="3">people are given the kind of sympathetic close-ups that serve to ro- manticize them. Nor is their behavior seen as socially determined- turning them into victims or products of poverty, racism, or brutal, abusive childhoods. But despite Travis' murderous rage towards the underclass, they are not viewed as monsters who are destroying the city's fabric. Even the rodent-like, abusive Sport is capable of some manipulative tenderness towards the affectless, fourteen year old pros- titute he exploits, Iris (Jody Foster). The debased life he offers her is seen by Scorsese as providing as much or as little joy as the world offered by her "ordinary folks" parents back in Pittsburgh. For Scorsese, people like Sport, the wild street kids, the prostitutes parading in front of the cab drivers' cafeteria are an integral part of the city's daily life- -people to be viewed as striking cinematic images rather than social problems to be dealt with, even if from Travis's alienated point of view they are animals fit only for annihilation. Travis' and Scorsese's perspectives, however, though never clearly differentiated, are not quite identical. Travis expresses his rage towards the people and wants to "flush the mess down the toilet." But if Travis sees the city as an "open sewer," whose (in the words of James Thomson, from a 1857 poem "Doom of the City") "flaring streets each night affront the patient skies/With a holocaust of woes, sins, lust, and blasphemies," those same streets are still pathways that en- ergize him, allowing his consciousness no rest. Their danger attracts Travis, immersing him in their corruption while, at the same time, he rails at the scum who inhabit the streets. All the while, Scorsese's fluid, soaring camera movement and formally rich mise-en-scene give us an unsentimental look at urban squalor and horror that always re- mains aware of its aesthetic possibilities. Scorsese also refuses to make a moral judgement on either Travis' actions or on the nature of daily life in New York, though one could say that by not providing a cri- tique, he has made a judgement by default. It is a stance that to some viewers may seem the signature of a privileged and detached artist~a man, who, it he chooses, can insulate himself from the city's terrors. Taxi Driver owes much more to city-centered film noir (e.g., the voice-over, oblique angle, mirror shot, unconventional minor charac- ters) than to social realism. And though there are a couple of neo- verité scenes that take place in Times Square and the East Village, Taxi Driver is no Open City or Wiseman documentary on city crime. In fact, most of the film feels like a slice of delirium~a selective, sub- jective view of a city where the balance between the hallucinatory and "normal" has tipped toward the nightmarish. And though Scorsese's New York in Taxi Driver is much more socially and psycho- 69</page><page sequence="4">logically grounded and particular than the typical studio set city (e.g., rainswept, dark streets, cocktail bars, night clubs, El tracks, seedy room- ing houses, and brownstones) of film noirs like Fritz Lang's Woman in the Window , it also shares with noir a penchant for constructing an aestheticized version of the night city, albeit a more convulsive, furi- ous, and deeply felt one. That city seen through Travis' windshield and rear view mirror is an iridescent cascade of neon and street lights, and the chaotic life on the streets~the shadows and shapes that in- habit them-are as exhilarating as they are threatening. There were works of film noir where social and political concerns were central, like Abe Polonsky's condemnation of New York's capi- talist ethos in Force of Evil and Edward Dmytryk's less cogent attack on anti-Semitism in Crossfire. In the majority of those films, however, explicit social commentary was subordinated to a projection of a gen- eral (metaphysical) sense of corruption, paranoia, and inexorable fate. The films were primarily thrillers, more interested in evoking feelings of unease and anxiety than in illuminating the nature of power, class, and ethnicity in urban life. The city depicted in these films, in critic Colin McArthur's words reflects "a kind of expressionist extension of the violence and brutality" (28) of the world and the people who in- habit it. Taxi Driver uses the city in just that way, the demons gnawing at Travis projected out on the city he hates. But Scorsese's vision of the city is more complex, personal, and darkly radiant than most of the works of film noir. Like a Robert Rauschenberg canvas, which some- times fixed to it real objects discovered on the New York streets, Scorsese focuses his camera on a solitary gun, a stainless steel cafete- ria ticket machine, a glass of water fizzing with salt, and the cab's medallion and bright yellow color. All these ordinary, everyday ob- jects are shot in a manner that captures and reinforces their beauty, turning them into anthropomorphic urban icons. Even Travis' attempt to liberate Iris by slaughtering Sport and his thug associates in the dimly-lit East Village tenement and its aftermath are stylized. Scorsese freezes the frame, shoots from an extreme over- head angle, and slowly tracks down the worn stairs, looking at the dead bodies and the dried blood on the walls as if they were part of a carefully composed museum tableau. Outdoors the scene is turned into street theatre. Shot in slow motion with a high overhead crane shot, the police, ambulance service, news photographers, and shirtsleeved neighborhood people crowd the sweating street looking just like a Weegee photo. Like the 19th century French poet Baudelaire, who writes in his 70</page><page sequence="5">book Paris Spleen, "Infamous City, I adore you! Courtesans and ban- dits, you offer me such joys," Scorsese the aesthete, formalist, and ex- seminarian finds poetry, grandeur, and possibly redemption in the grime, gore, and destructiveness of the city. Though he may not be "happy of heart" like Baudelaire reflecting on the city's "purgatory" and "hell," and not interested in turning Sport into some revelatory street poet-hipster as the fifties Beats would have done, his netherworld can still be strikingly beautiful. There is a part of Scorsese's sensibility that, without displaying a trace of naivete, aesthetically and, at moments, even spiritually em- braces New York's sordidness. Taxi Driver displays a genuine passion for a city which many people either recoil from or, if having some residue of social concern, wish to make more equitable and just. Scorsese, however, exhibits no shock or revulsion with what he sees, nor does he have any interest in providing an agenda for social re- form. His New York glows in its meanness: Scorsese has transformed it into a metropolis, in Baudelaire's words, "whose hellish charm resuscitates." Works Cited McArthur, Colin, Underworld U.S.A.
