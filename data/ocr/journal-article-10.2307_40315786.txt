<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NIVKH (GILYAK) OF SAKHALIN AND THE LOWER AMUR LYDIA BLACK INTRODUCTION Of the five ethnic groups of Northeastern Si- beria traditionally designated as Palaeoasiatics (Shrenk, 1883:1:257) or Palaeosiberians (Czaplicka, 1914:17), namely the Koryak, Kamchadal, Chukchi, Yukagir, and Gilyak, none are of greater interest to anthropologists than the latter. The Gilyak or, to use the currently established usage and the official Soviet nomenclature, the Nivkh, are a cultural and linguistic isolate, showing few affinities with their immediate neighbors, the Ainu and the Tungus/ Manchu peoples.1 In physical type the Nivkh, too, show certain peculiarities, which, like the Ainu, present investigators with puzzling questions as to their origin and genetic links with other groups.2 Shternberg, on the basis of typological lin- guistic similarities, believed the Nivkh to be linked to certain groups of the American Northwest coast (1904a:137-140), while Shrenk in a very cautious fashion seemed to imply affinities to Southeast Asia and possibly Oceania (1883:1:255, 257, 262; 1899:11:197). Levin, a prominent Soviet scholar and specialist in physical anthropology, favors the theory of the Nivkh 's autochthonous origin without ruling out either their possible southern affinities (via the Ainu whom he views as a link to Austra- loids) or their genetic links to the populations of the Northwest coast of the American continent (1963:112).3 While linguistic data and the Nivkh physical type should be of interest to culture historians, their social structure, also quite distinct from that of surrounding populations, is of great interest to social anthropologists, particularly to specialists interested in alliance theory and prescriptive matri- lateral cross-cousin marriage. Levi-Strauss based a major section of his seminal work on this prob- lem, Elementary Structures of Kinship (1969:292- 309) on Nivkh data. Since then, references to Nivkh social order have been frequently made in various publications prominent in the controversy which followed the appearance of Levi-Strauss1 book (i.e., Homans and Schneider, 1955; Needham, 1962). Russian ethnographers since Middendorf, who visited the northern limits of the Nivkh area in 1844, have realized the peculiar position of this group in the overall ethnographic picture of Eastern Siberia; many excellent materials describing and analyzing their material culture, language, physical type, social order and belief system are extant. Unfortunately, almost none of this material is avail- able to English-speaking students. Shternberg's fundamental work on Nivkh social organization, announced for publication as volume IV of the Memoirs of the Jesup North-Pacific Expedition, American Museum of Natural History, remains un- published.* The technical listing of English lan- guage anthropological literature on the Nivkh is quickly exhausted: Czaplicka (1914) gives brief mention and a synopsis of aspects of Nivkh cul- ture; Sir James Frazer's description of bear ritual is stripped of context (193 5, pt. V:v. 11:190-196); finally, there is Laufer's treatment of Nivkh art (1902) and his very inadequate, and in many re- spects erroneous, sketch of Nivkh culture (1900). Yet the Nivkh loom large in works of Western anthropological theory, not only in those on kin- ship and marriage, but also in some on socio- cultural evolution, particularly of the Marxist variety, since Engels, on the basis of a newspaper report on Shternberg's preliminary results, cited them as a test case and evidence for the existence of group marriage (1942:164-167). Clearly, then, an account of traditional Nivkh culture should be of interest not solely to area specialists. I began my study of Nivkh society in order to gain a better understanding of theoretical implications of prescriptive matrilateral cross- cousin marriage in light of alliance theory. I came to believe that studying these people may possibly point the way to finding solutions to some of the most fascinating problems in culture history and anthropology. ** ^Russian language version of this work was published posthumously in Khabarovsk, 1933.

Nivkh territory</page><page sequence="3">Black: The Nivkh 3 This paper presents a synthetic and hopefully comprehensive account of traditional Nivkh culture. It is a synthesis of many sources of varying quality, anthropological competence and importance. These sources are comprised of ethnographic monographs and articles scattered in publications in many lan- guages, often out of print, travellers' accounts, memoirs, and literature of a polemical nature. Con- trary to Laufer (1900:315-317), who quite erron- eously reported that the Nivkh ethnic group was divided into three distinct tribes, their culture, in spite of dialectal differences in speech, is singu- larly uniform regardless of the geographical loca- tion of any sub-unit (Shternberg, 1893:2; Zolotarev, 1933:52). In fact, Zolotarev explicitly criticizes Laufer's error and states: "There are no significant ethnographic differences. ..." The data presented in this account, then, apply to the Nivkh as a whole. The basic anthropological and ethnographic materials pertaining to the study of the Nivkh are works by Shrenk, Shternberg, Kreinovich and Tak- sami; these have been utilized heavily. The work of Panfilov is pertinent for the study of Nivkh lan- guage and folklore; the work of Ivanov, for the study of Nivkh art. The work of Smolyajc, though cited occasionally, deals primarily with changes which have taken place in Nivkh society and cul- ture in the last decades and is not particularly relevant in a work such as this, which is set in the ethnographic present. A brief evaluation of these sources appears in the Bibliographical Appendix, although it should be noted that various Japanese sources, of differing value and quality, were in- accessible to me because of the language barrier. Direct quotes and references to matters of fact taken from specific sources are cited directly in the text. Additional documentation for the sources used in this paper will be found in a listing, by topic, of important bibliographical materials that appears in the Appendix. The Arabic numbers found in the body of the text refer to this topical listing. /. THE PEOPLE, THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND MODE OF ADAPTATION The Nivkh, a small tribe who in historic times did not exceed 6,000 in population,4 inhabit the area of the Lower Amur basin, including the delta, a coastal strip to the north and south of the river's mouth known as the Liman (estuary), adjacent areas on the coast of the sea of Okhotsk and the northern portion of the Island of Sakhalin. The westernmost limit of their area of settlement lies on the Amur near Bogorodskoe, below Khabarovsk. Along the sea- coast their settlements extend to the river Kol' in the North and to Cape Lazarev in the South (Tak- sami, 1967:7). Though Middendorf reported Nivkh settlements on the continent as far north as Tugur Bay and the Shantar Islands, Shrenk, travelling less than two decades later, did not find them there. All ethnographic sources agree that the limits of Nivkh settlement have changed little, if at all, for at least three centuries; the area of their present location is considered to be their traditional an- cient homeland (Shternberg, 1933:19; 1904b:l-5; Okladnikov, 1968:v. 1: 1 27-1 50). 5 Next to the waters of rivers and the sea, the great forest, the taiga, is the dominant factor of the Nivkh environment, both on the mainland, where the Amur flows swiftly and turbulently, hemmed in by the foothills of great mountain ranges , until it reaches the Liman, and on Sakhalin, where the two mountain chains are crossed by numerous short but rapid streams. Two of these, the Tym1, flowing roughly northwest, and Poronai, flowing south, are of major importance for the Nivkh. The environment is extremely rich in natural resources; it is markedly variable due to differences in elevation and the influence of sea currents, the cold Okhotsk current in the north and the warm Tsushima current in the south. The vegetation ranges from tundra-type in the extreme north of Sakhalin, to the dense conifer forests of the moun- tain ranges, to the lush mixed forests in the south of the island. The climate may be characterized in complete the initial research on which this paper is based; I am deeply indebted to Dr. Robert Auster- litz, Department of Linguistics, Columbia Univer- sity, not only for generously making available his work on Nivkh language but for constant moral support; to Dr. Chester S. Chard, Department of Anthropology, University of Wisconsin, for making this publication possible as well as encouragement offered at the initial stages of my work on the Nivkh; to Prof. Roman Jakobson, Harvard University, for his gift of the bibliographical guide, Paleo Si- berian Peoples and Languages, of which he is the senior author, and reprints of his publications on the Nivkh language; to Miss Margaret Currier, Peabody Museum Library, Harvard, the staff at the Reference Desk of Goldfarb Library, Brandéis University, and Goodell Library, University of Massachusetts, especially Stanley Radosh, Slavic Bibliographer, for unfailing assistance in locating rare source materials and last, but by no means least, to the Faculty of Department of Anthropology, University of Massachusetts, for making it possible for me to take the time to revise the original manuscript; to Dr. and Mrs. Joel Halpern for personal help.

They are primarily semi-sedentary fishermen and sea mammal hunters, with gathering and land mammal hunting represent- ing supplementary sources of subsistence and wealth (Shternberg, 1893:2-3; 1904b:I:15-l6; 1933: 25-26). The nearest neighbors of the Nivkh are the Ainu on Sakhalin, with whom they have maintained in historic times a close contact of a rather am- biguous character. While inter-group marriages, acquisition of territory by agreement and/or pur- chase (Shternberg, 1893:3; 1904b:I:5; 1904b:II:72; 1933:2:300) and adoption of Ainu into Nivkh lin- eages have been recorded, the tradition of a hostile relationship is dominant. According to this tradi- tion, Nivkh raided the Ainu frequently and the Ainu provided the Nivkh with a prime source of domestic slaves (Shternberg, 1893:3; Zolotarev, 1933:59).7 Sakhalin Nivkh were also in contact with the Orok, a Tungus people with a reindeer-oriented economy, but this contact is relatively new. The Orok are reported to have entered Sakhalin possibly as recently as the late eighteenth century (Okladni- kov, 1968:11:432) and not earlier than the seven- teenth (Dolgikh in Tikhomirov, 1958:139). On the mainland, the Nivkh were in close con- tact with Nanai (Gold), Ul'ch, Oroch, Udekhe, all belonging to Southern Tungus/Manchu peoples, and the Negidal of the Northern Tungus group (Shrenk, 1883:1:11-12; Shternberg, 1933:1-10). Intermarriage between Nivkh and Ainu on the one hand and be- tween Nivkh and their Tungus ic neighbors on the other, appears to have been rather frequent (Shtern- berg, 1904b:10; 1933:285-291; Taksami, 1967:206; Smolyak, 1967:95-103; Smolyak, 1960:94-95). Lin- guistic interaction is also documented (Seeland, 1886:24; Shternberg, 1893:1; Kreinovich, 1955: 135-167). Shternberg reports that some of his Nivkh informants claimed that the Nivkh and various Tungus peoples were "the same people," a claim heatedly and scornfully denied by the Tungus/ Manchu (Shternberg, 1893:1; 1933:285). 8 The Nivkh had been in contact with the Chi- nese since the twelfth century and possibly earlier (Okladnikov, 1968:1:404; Stephan, 1971:20-38). The Chinese, especially under the Manchu dynasty, claimed political control of the Nivkh area and attempted to administer the indigenous population, including the Nivkh of Sakhalin. It is reported that in the eighteenth century the Chinese appointed headmen or chiefs from among the Nivkh to act as middlemen between the Chinese administration and the people. Apparently, these agents carried no authority or weight whatsoever once the Chinese military detachment and tax collector were out of sight. The institution of the headman, even the very idea of centralized authority, was contrary to Nivkh tradition (Shternberg, 1893:15; Shrenk, 1881- 1895:111:316). The Amur Nivkh traded with the Chinese, car- rying their goods, mostly furs acquired during the hunting season or traded from inland settlements of Sakhalin, along the Sungari river to Sans in, the nearest major Chinese city. The furs were ex- changed for Chinese cloth, silk, brocade and cotton goods. There is evidence to suggest that the Nivkh then channeled these goods to Japanese outposts in southern Sakhalin, serving as very efficient middlemen in a trading circuit (Smolyak, 1960:95; Shrenk, 1899:11:276-277). From the Chinese, the Nivkh also obtained grains considered luxury foods, tobacco and alco- hol - the Chinese raki - as well as a small quan- tity of porcelain items, mainly beads, and tobacco pipes which sometimes were of jade. Metal ob- jects were also obtained. Flat, small-sized disks were used to decorate women's clothing, while other objects were melted down and reworked by Nivkh smiths to their own taste. In any case, they preferred Japanese metalware.9 The Japanese came in contact with the Nivkh rather late, penetrating the southern part of Sakhalin in the early nineteenth century and establishing a few outposts. Trade was the main mechanism of contact. Nivkh trading expeditions are reported to have followed sea routes to Japanese settlements in southern Sakhalin from the mainland, as well as trading on northern Hokkaido. Land routes were followed south from the Sakhalin interior. An im- portant item in Japanese trade was sea eagle feathers, treasured by the Japanese for ritual rea- sons, which the Nivkh provided in abundance. They captured fledglings and raised them in captivity specifically for the purpose of obtaining feathers for trade (Shrenk, 1899:II:251).10 In Nivkh tradition, the relationship between the Nivkh, Chinese and Japanese, recognized as one of long standing, was expressed in kinship terms. The Nivkh referred to Chinese as ytk-utgu - ancestor - and to Japanese as ytk-ymgu - ancestress (Shtern- berg, 1893:1). The Russians came into contact with the Nivkh in the early seventeenth century, when bands of Cossack explorers penetrated the Amur Basin and the shores of the Sea of Okhotsk. Contact at this stage was sporadic and often hostile, earning the Nivkh a reputation for ferocity, as at times they were able to more than hold their own against the intruders. Massive Russian penetration of the Nivkh area began in 1850 with the landing of Nevelskoi in the delta and the founding of a military post which later became the city of Nikolaevsk (Kabanov, 1959:136).n</page><page sequence="6">6 Arctic Anthropology X-l The rapid influx of Russian settlers and the estab- lishment of a penal colony on Sakhalin, where Nivkh were often employed as guards and trackers (Kolarz, 1969:70; Chekhov, 1903; Hawes, 1904:263) resulted in qualitatively different contact with a technologically superior people. Pressure on Nivkh territory and resources rapidly increased. New economic factors became instrumental - notably the large scale commercial fishing by Russians and Japanese in the area - and the traditional order soon began to crumble (Shrenk, 1893:1:19; Zolotarev, 1933:58; Smolyak, 1960:95-97). Shrenk, who visited the area in 1854-1858 as head of a govern- ment-sponsored scientific expedition, was able to record and describe the main aspects of Nivkh tradi- tional culture, concentrating on their technology and adaptation to the environment. Shternberg, working on Sakhalin and the Lower Amur at the turn of the century, was able to describe and analyze the traditional social order. Aspects of this order, some of them persisting well into the twentieth century and even to this day, were examined in detail by Russian anthropologists, some of them Shternberg's students, at later dates. At the time of the first European contact the Nivkh lived what many have somewhat erroneously termed a Stone Age life. It was a life dependent on the bounty of nature for survival, on the sea- sonal run of the great fish, on the animals of the forest and the wild fruits and other useful plants which the women gathered in the summer. The Nivkh technological inventory was splen- didly adapted to the conditions of their environ- ment and their life style. Though they borrowed elements of material culture from other peoples , they fitted these elements into their own unique way of life. Their materials were wood and stone, bone, fish and animal skins and plant fibers. They worked iron and other metals to produce items they desired, giving these a specifically Nivkh stamp. Simple as these materials were, the Nivkh achieved amazing sophistication in the design of necessary equipment, often decorating utilitarian items with great skill. In general, their plastic art was vigor- ous, strong, and very much their own. Unfortunately, space permits only this very brief outline of the material culture of traditional Nivkh society. //. THE SETTLEMENT12 AND THE DWELLING1* The choice of a settlement site was usually de- termined both by Nivkh economic dependence upon large scale fishing and sea mammal hunting, and by locally prevailing climatic conditions. Settlement sites were always located close to a stream or sea- shore, and preferably on high ground, well above the flood watermark. Proximity of water was im- portant not only for fishermen but also to ensure an adequate supply for household needs. Shrenk writes: All Gilyak settlements were located in the immediate vicinity of the Amur, Liman, on the sea, and along the course of the Tym1 river, the main artery of Sakhalin. It would be fu- tile to look for their villages in the mountains or away from the water basins. The location was always chosen with regard to favorable features of the terrain: if on the sea, in a small bay or coast indentation sheltered by rocky outcroppings from the storms, which here may be very violent; if on the river, on a dry bank, normally where spring floods did not reach, with boat anchorage of suf- ficient depth, the site bordered by tall for- est or a thicket which offered shelter from winter storms. If the terrain offered fea- tures which answered both their winter and summer needs, the settlement was permanent with a variety of structures. If not, winter and summer settlements were constructed in different locations. Thus arose seasonal settlements, whose inhabitants moved twice yearly. Often the winter and summer dwell- ings, containing the same population, were located in the vicinity of each other. Thus , I observed on Sakhalin in close proximity summer dwellings located near the seashore and the winter dwellings just a bit further inland, where under the shelter offered by mountains and forest they were safe from the weather and where it was easy to obtain fuel. However, occasionally the distances between winter and summer settlements were considerable. On the Amur it happened that seasonal settlements were built on opposite banks (1899:11:9-10) Sometimes the choice of the locality was in- fluenced by the abundance of natural resources, not least the plants important to Nivkh economy, pri- marily nettles that were used for cordage. The vil- lage of Ada- Tym', for example, was built in an area where nettles grew in abundance (Shternberg, 1893: 45-46). As is evident from the Shrenk quotation cited above, seasonal transhumance was the rule. The winter settlements were occupied approximately from October till April or May, depending on the local weather conditions, with the breaking of the ice cover signaling the commencement of the sum- mer season. Summer dwellings were occupied ap- proximately from May to September.13</page><page sequence="7">Black: The Nivkh 7 Nivkh settlements tended to be small.14 Shrenk estimated the average number of dwellings per settlement as three for the Amur and Liman areas and two for western Sakhalin and the Tym1 valley (1899:11:51-53). The small number of dwellings was in no way indicative of population size. Shternberg states that often a Nivkh dwelling was occupied by more than 50 persons (1893:34; 1933: 30). Taksami gives his own data for the village of Kal'ma on the Amur as three dwellings and a popu- lation of over 40 (1961:100-102), while elsewhere estimates of from two to five dwellings and from 10 to 80 persons per settlement are given (Shtern- berg, 1893:42-46; Taksami, 1961:100). Many Nivkh settlements consisted of a single dwelling occu- pied by an extended patrilineally oriented house- hold. On the other hand, some villages far ex- ceeded the average. With each settlement were associated fishing and hunting sites, known as the lineage domain or territory15 (Zolotarev, 1933:55; Shternberg, 1893:33; Kreinovich, 1936). In Nivkh ideology each lineage was associated with a territory, and rules for be- havior reflected this ideology. An individual, for example, could not light a fire or drink water from a stream in a territory belonging to another lineage, and even war parties, intent on vengeance, ob- served this rule (Shternberg, 1904b:III:90). Lin- eage names were derived from territorial associa- tions (Shternberg, 1904b:III:99-100; Zolotarev, 1933: 53-55). Theoretically, then, a settlement should have contained household members of a single lin- eage only. In practice, the law was honored in the breach, and while some settlements did contain only members of one lineage, many settlements were multi- lineage ones, especially the larger villages in economically favorable locations. Fre- quent lineage fission resulted in population move- ment from territory to territory. Outside pressure, especially from the Tungus/Manchu and later from Russian settlers, must have contributed to the de- velopment of multi- lineage settlements. The overall settlement pattern of the Nivkh may be character- ized as one of dispersed descent groups (Shtern- berg, 1893:16; 1904b:III:98; Zolotarev, 1933:52-55). The settlement plan was linear. Lineage affili- ation dictated the order of the dwellings in any given settlement. All members of an agnatic lin- eage resident in the area could build in the village. Brothers or sons wishing to establish separate households did so, building their dwellings up- stream from the dwelling of the founder, as did all the newcomers to the locality, regardless of lin- eage affiliation. In exceptionally large villages a second line of dwellings, farther from shore than the first, could be established (Kreinovich, 1936: 713; Taksami, 1961:100-101). The doors of all the dwellings were always oriented toward the east, away from the mly-vo, the abode of the dead, be- lieved to have been located to the west in the world "below" (Taksami, 1961:101). In addition to the dwellings,16 the Nivkh settle- ment exhibited a variety of subsidiary structures, such as storage sheds usually built on piles in the manner of the summer dwellings, fish drying racks, fish dressing platforms, platforms for storage of gear, dog shelters and boat beaching places. Birth huts, absolutely indispensable according to Nivkh ideology, were always located behind the respec- tive permanent dwellings. Lezang, ritual barns wherein were kept lineage paraphernalia for the bear festival, were located only in settlements specifically regarded as the home ground of a given lineage. More precisely, "small" or temporary ritual storage structures may have been built in villages where segments of the original lineage were relocated, but the "great" lineage lezang belonged strictly to home territory. By and large, lezang were located in villages where the eldest members of the lineage resided. Lineage burial grounds were also located in what was con- sidered the main lineage settlement, and were sit- uated between the village and the forest (Shtern- berg, 1893:16). Describing the village of Kal'ma, Taksami writes: The settlement was small - only three winter dwellings with population of over forty persons. The buildings consisted in addition to winter dwellings of summer dwellings, fish racks, fish dressing plat- forms - khyln'r - and poles for storage of fishing equipment. All structures were erected near the shore in a predetermined order. Immediately near the water's edge were located structures for fish processing - khyln'r and chanf , somewhat farther, about 25 to 40 meters were winter dwellings, adjacent to them summer dwellings and other economic structures. There were four bear corrals and two structures where re- posed bear festival utensils. On shore, away from the dwellings, were beached the boats. On the edge of the settlement in the woods was the burial ground where each lineage had its allotted space. (1961:102) Each lineage had also a space allocated for ritual placement of dolphin heads (Shternberg, 1904b: 25) and places for worship in the forest and at the seashore where ritual offerings, once again by lin- eages, were made to the Masters of the Earth and the Heavens and to the Master of the Waters (Shtern- berg, 1904b:II:31; 1933:59, 312-313; Kreinovich, 1935:113). Settlements were abandoned only in extreme and unusual circumstances, such as an epidemic,</page><page sequence="8">8 Arctic Anthropology X-l drastic failure of the fish catch, or extraordinary incidence of child mortality (Taksami, 1961:107). Individuals were also very reluctant to leave the home area (Shternberg, 1893:17). If an old settle- ment was abandoned and a new site sought, ritual consecration of the new location had to be held within nine days of arrival. A dog of red color had to be sacrificed in the forest (Taksami, 1961:109). The winter dwellings, tulf tyvt were of two types. The dwelling considered representative of the most ancient tradition was the toryf or to ryv, in the Eastern dialect simply to (Taksami, 1961: 111). This type of dwelling was semi- subterranean in construction. Outside, on the surface, it pre- sented a moundlike appearance, and was relatively large in size and square in groundplan.* The floor was sunk into the ground to the depth of three to four feet, the pit forming a space often about twenty by twenty-two feet square. The walls of the excavation were smoothed and lined with poles packed closely together. Four crossbeams formed a frame which was affixed to four main support posts. On the upper part of these posts were carved human faces, male and female (Taksami, 1961:115 from unpublished notes by Shternberg). A sloping pyramidal roof was constructed over the frame. The roof, too, was built of thin wooden poles, then covered with grass and packed earth. The roofing poles did not quite meet in the center, forming a small, squarish opening which served in daylight as the sole source of illumination but had the main function of a smoke hole. The entrance to the dwelling, facing east for ritual reasons, was usually on the lee side, shel- tered from the prevailing winds. The entrance did not lead directly into the living space but was con- nected to it by a relatively long, narrow passage constructed on a slight incline. The passage was also roofed over with poles, dry grass, packed earth and sod. It connected directly with the living room floor by means of a few steps , infrequently a notched log. The passage was used for storage of gear and supplies. The passage was separated from the living space by a narrow door, made of wood, which may have been hinged or was displaced laterally (Taksami, 1967:163; 1961:113). The floor was of beaten, stomped earth. The interior was arranged around a central fire- place located directly under the smoke hole. Along the walls around the entire circumference of the room ran rather low and wide sleeping benches. The Nivkh spent much of their time on these, eating, ^Shrenk's groundplan with rounded corners (1899:11:21) and his description thereof (1899:11: 12-23) is considered by Taksami to relate to a special, perhaps unique case (1961:13). smoking, entertaining, or sleeping. They slept al- ways with feet to the wall, head toward the hearth (Taksami, 1961:128). The space behind the benches, especially in the newer model yet to be discussed, was the favored abode of rats, extremely numerous and cordially detested by the human inhabitants (Shrenk, 1899:11:19). The sleeping benches were constructed of planking. The benches were continuous, with spaces left open only at the corners which were utilized for storage of various personal possessions. The central portion of the back bench, directly across from the entry and immediately behind the hearth, was the place of honor. Here were seated the most honored guests and here, too, were laid men mauled by bears. Above the sleeping benches between the four main support posts ran poles from which were sus- pended various utensils and items of equipment; the poles were also used for drying and airing clothing and bedding. Children's cradles were suspended from the roof poles near the walls, in the back part of the benches (Shrenk, 1903:111:13). Space under the eaves, behind the sleeping benches, was also utilized for storage. The fireplace, t'ut, was central not only in a physical sense, but also as the focus of Nivkh domestic life (Shternberg, 1893:18; Shrenk, 1899: 11:15). Food for every family was prepared here, each woman cooking separately for her husband and children (Shternberg, 1893:33). Dog food was prepared here, and the dogs fed on a special raised platform next to the fireplace (Shrenk, 1899:11:16- 18). The fire had great ritual significance, as did the hearth. The Nivkh recognized a whole class of transgressions against the fire and the hearth, and in the Nivkh view these transgressions were so serious that they must be styled as blasphemy. Such offenses, if committed by strangers, could lead to a blood feud. Less serious offenses against the hearth called for fines paid to the head of the household, usually a "blood dog" - chokh kan (Shternberg, 1893:24; Kreinovich, 1930:47-48). The hearth was constructed on a wooden frame, approximately four by eight feet, which was filled with packed earth. Kreinovich says that this frame could not be moved if the dwelling was abandoned. He writes: If a Gilyak wanted to move it to a newly constructed dwelling, he had recourse to a subterfuge: he bound one side of the hearth frame by a thong and harnessed to it a dog; pretending to help the dog, ever so little, he moved the frame to a new house. In order to avoid the wrath of the Master of the Fire, the Gilyak replaced himself by the dog (1930:47).</page><page sequence="9">Black: The Nivkh 9 A tripod constructed of poles, one toward the front, two toward the back of the hearth, was placed over it and from it hung hooks on wooden handles of various length to hang kettles and cook- ing pots. In the very front portion of the hearth were embedded three stones designed to support the large kettle in which Nivkh customarily cooked broth for dogs. The earth filling the frame of the hearth could be replaced only during a bear ritual (Taksami, 1961:114). During the bear ritual festi- val the fire on the household hearth could be lit only by means of flint and tinder, symbolizing and belonging to the lineage, that was kept by the eldest living competent male agnate (Shternberg 1893:11). Water for household use was kept in a birch bark barrel, right next to the fireplace in the direction of the door. This plan of the subterranean dwelling is con- sidered unique, peculiar to the Nivkh, without analogies among other Siberian peoples (Levin and Potapov, 1961:160) though dwellings of similar type from prehistoric times have been excavated (Okladnikov, 1968:1:131, 309). The allocation of space in the dwelling, to be discussed in greater detail when the composition of the Nivkh household will be considered, followed certain definite rules (Taksami, 1961:115). A dwell- ing was usually inhabited by a number of agnatically linked nuclear families. The central back bench was the domain of the eldest male member of the household and of his family; his sons and their families occupied the bench to the right of the back bench (to the left from the entry), while the bench opposite was reserved for any other occupants re- gardless of their relationship status (Taksami, 1961:116). The second dwelling type, chadryf or chad ryv, considered to have been borrowed from Chinese Manchu populations (Shrenk, 1899:11:19), even in Shrenk's time largely replaced the typically Nivkh semi- subterranean to ryv. According to Taksami, the latter has completely disappeared at present (Taksami, 1967:164; 1961:120). Significant is Taksami 's statement that features common to both dwelling types have Nivkh names, while innovative features have names which parallel Tungus and Manchu terms (Taksami, 1961:125). Chad ryv was a large oblong frame structure with a gently sloping, very massive roof. Its distinctive features were windows, usually seven in number, covered by choice fish skins carefully cured and worked until they achieved full transparency, stretched on a ribbed wooden framework; and a central heating system with two fireplaces. It should be noted that each structural feature of a Nivkh dwelling had a symbolic significance which often figured in ritual and had a specific name. Thus, each of the seven windows had a name which simul- taneously indicated its location and symbolic asso- ciation. Posts, beams, sleeping benches, and above all, fireplaces, when there were two, each had a name (Shternberg, 1933:315; Taksami, 1961: 124). In general, in naming construction features, the Nivkh utilized the two-fold frame of reference characteristic of their conceptualization of world order, which incorporates the dialectic opposition of the wild and the domestic. Within the domain of the wild, there was an opposition of land, ex- pressed as mountain/forest, and water, usually but not always, expressed as the sea. The hearth and the threshold represented the domestic and human elements at the same time as they mediated between the two domains, the wilderness and the human. They also played an implicit role in mediation be- tween the "above" and the "below" operative in the Nivkh world view and mediated explicitly by the tree symbolically used. Each dwelling had a spirit, a patron saint so to speak, and this spirit may best be described, borrowing an expression from Lienhardt, as unity in multiplicity. There was foremost the Mistress (or Master or perhaps Mistress and Master - the sex and singleness or duality represented in opposite sexes is in dispute) of the hearth and fire. The house spirit in another aspect resided under or in two rocks located at the threshold that were em- bedded in the floor at different heights, one at the exact level of the threshold itself. On the outside of the threshold offerings to the Master of the Earth were buried (Shternberg, 1933:317). Evidence in the literature suggests that these spirits were regarded as ancestral or, at the very least, were associated conceptually with the ancestors. The fire, too, was inhabited by a benevolent Mistress or a couple of ancestral quality. In the new style Chines e/Manchu-type dwelling which had two fireplaces, located at the sides of the entrance, one was dedicated to the Master of the Waters while the other belonged to the Master of the Mountain/Forest. The owner of the house and his family occupied the space on the sleeping benches next to the hearth of the Master of the Waters , to the left of the entry. However, bear meat could be cooked only on the hearth of the Master of the Mountain/Forest, to the right of the entry (Shternberg, 1933:315). The floor space was also divided with reference to the two wilderness domains, and during religious rites offerings intended for the Master of one or the other were placed only in their respective halves of the house (Shternberg, 1933:315).* During the bear *While in areas where new-type dwellings were the rule it was believed that the bear festival could be conducted in houses with two fireplaces only, in areas where the old- type dwelling with a</page><page sequence="10">10 Arctic Anthropology X-l co x: u ¡ ¿2 Q) tí &gt;S 0) o&gt; fO r-\ "&gt; u 3 Oh O w D-, ro</page><page sequence="11">Black: The Nivkh j¿ 5-8 - 3 - i-* ^S Si r^ 8 «5 C 4) 0) o -M 4i á a 9 8f S S S H 01 « » O&gt; $ « J3 c 6 &lt;-&gt; 41 i I co o.

In size chad ryv were often very large, thirty by twenty- seven feet or more. As in the to ryv , the sleeping benches ran the entire length of the walls , but the entry was placed near the end of one wall. The sleeping benches terminated at the fireplaces. From these fireplaces pipes or conduits ran under the benches in Chine se/Manchu fashion to a chimney located in a corner of the wall opposite the door. The center space was occupied by a large trestle used to tie up dogs at feeding time. The Nivkh used no metal, either in house or boat construction, with dovetailing being employed for joining whenever necessary. While decorative carving and ornamentation were absent in the old style dwelling, prominent structural features of chad ryv were decoratively carved (Taksami, 1961: 124-125).** Construction of a new winter dwelling was a cooperative enterprise, concerning all resident lineage members and even af fines. Any visitors on hand during the construction period were also ex- pected to donate their labor. Summer dwellings were constructed by individuals (Shternberg, 1893: 35). Such construction, representing commencement of a new life, so to speak, was an important event fraught with symbolic significance and was accom- panied by a variety of complex rituals. Construction at every step required ritual action (Shternberg, 1933:314; Taksami, 1961:159-164). Some of these rituals were conceived as "strengthening the house." An example of this type of ritual was the final act of the construction: the placement of two poles decorated with carvings of symbolic signifi- cance, one at each end of the house along the longitudinal axis. The poles were joined by a string on which were hung representations of the sun (fe- male, in Nivkh world view), the moon (male), and bunches of wood shavings called tsakh or chakh and often referred to in Russian literature by their Ainu name inau, which were used in all Nivkh rit- uals. This "strengthening of the house" was be- s ingle hearth was common no such rule apparently existed (Shternberg, 1933:313). ^Shternberg and Taksami do not seem to agree as to which Master was allocated which half, the right or the left. I tend to give Taksami benefit of doubt. **See for details Ivanov, S. V., Arkhitekturnyi ornament narodov Nizhnego Amura, Sbornik Muzeia Antropologii i Etnografii, v. 15, 1953, 234- 290. lieved to lessen the danger of penetration by dan- gerous or hostile spirits (Shternberg, 1893:20; 1933: 317; Taksami, 1961:163). This contraption with all the emblems was never removed, but was left in place until it deteriorated from natural causes. Before occupancy could begin, however, additional ritual action was necessary. One might say that the ritual process connected with the place of resi- dence never ceased. It began well before construc- tion itself. The place for a new dwelling was selected by the eldest resident member of the lineage. No dwelling could be constructed on a place previously occupied. Once selection was made, a shaman sometimes, but by no means always, was called to verify the rightness of choice and to check out possible spiritual influences operative at the site. If the shaman divined the presence of malignant spirits, a new location was sought, this time under the direction of the officiating shaman (Taksami, 1961:159). The construction commenced, once the site was agreed on, by digging holes for the main supporting posts. Clean pebbles, often flints, branches of wild rose, and pike-fish heads were placed into them (Shternberg, 1933:334; Taksami, 1961:159-160). Next, wall construction began, and once the first layer was done, divination might again be employed to determine if the enterprise were propitious. Flour was spread on the building site and left overnight. If upon inspection the next morning it was found undisturbed or showed a print of a man's foot, all was well; if animal tracks or an imprint of a human hand were discerned, the construction was abandoned and begun anew on another place (Taksami, 1961:159; Shternberg, 1933: 315). As the construction neared completion, the main supports were carved with human faces and the stones where the spirit of the house was to reside were placed in the proper position at the threshold. Taksami reports that in northern Sakhalin it was the practice to place an axe upon the threshold and leave it there overnight to insure that evil spirits would not enter (1961:159). The same day that construction was completed, the owner entered the dwelling at sunset to observe any unusual visual or aural phenomena: to listen for any noises and creaks. Any occurrence of either was interpreted as evidence of the presence of malignant spirits (Shternberg, 1933:317; Taksami, 1961:159). If none were detected, the dwelling was occupied immediately, and the ritual of the "feeding of the house" conducted. Four dogs, one for each house corner, were sacrificed. Of course, if the family were in strained circumstances , allowances were made, and two dogs, one for each of the front corners, had to suffice (Taksami, 1961:159). The interior of the house was decorated with chakh (inau) and Shternberg reports that blood from the</page><page sequence="13">Black: The Nivkh 13 hearts of the sacrificed animals was sprinkled on them (1933:334). Taksami states that the house corners were smeared with blood (1961:159). Ac- cording to Kreinovich, one dog was strangled on (or over) the beam. The blood from the heart of this animal was used to smear the navel (emphasis added) of the male and female guardians, kok , resident in the two last posts of the winter dwell- ing. In a summer dwelling the blood was used to smear the junctions of posts and subflooring (1930:49). The meat of the animals was cooked and eaten. The dog's head, together with paws tucked underneath it is hung outside, either over the doorway, or, sometimes, at the back wall and the ritual formula pronounced: "lie here, if evil spirit comes, bark; guard against the evil spirit." (Kreinovich, 1930: 49) Various boiled dishes (roasted and fried food was prohibited) were prepared in order to "feed the house. " The owner took up a small portion of each dish and spread the food on every significant struc- tural feature of the dwelling. Similar food offerings were made at the hearth, and portions of each dish thrown into the fire. These actions were accom- panied by the repetition of an incantation formula, roughly translated as "Be a good house, make the life of my children happy, make it so that they will remain healthy" (Shternberg, 1933:317, 334-335; Taksami, 1961:159-160). A feast for invited guests, old and respected men, was held following the "feeding of the house. " Each guest partook of the dishes offered and repeated the ritual formula cited above (Taksami, 1961:160). Shternberg's descrip- tion of the rituals associated with house construc- tion agrees in general with the account given by Taksami but contains the following additional details: three young firs were placed in the fireplace, following the "feeding of the house," and to each were tied sarana roots, two per tree.* This arrangement was referred to as little bear.** Shternberg does not elucidate the significance of this name. When the household was asleep "the little bear" was burned (Shternberg, 1933:334, 335). According to Shternberg, when food was offered to *This detail is of interest, as the number three signifies "male" and the number two, "fe- male. " **I believe, on the basis of an analysis of the Nivkh symbolic system, now in progress, that the bear is a symbol for ancestors and the "little bear" over the fireplace condenses the reference to an- cestors, both male and female. the fire in the new dwelling, a prayer asking for good fortune in hunting was said. The prayer was once again followed by offerings of food to the fire and to inau placed in the house. The final act, according to Shternberg, was called the "feeding of the bitch who looks backwards." (In the Russian rendering, however, an alternate reading is possible: "the bitch who looks toward the backside" or "into the anus.") While Shternberg's statement, one of his rough field notes published in the 1933 edition of his works, does not provide any elucidation, Kreinovich sheds some light on this point: According to Gilyak notions a bitch lives in the winter dwelling, on the third beam over the door: kel n'un an'kh (from kel'd = back of a body, backside and n'und = to look; an'kh = bitch). They say also keV geVn an'kh (from keV geVd = to lie on the back and also in the coitus position). Ap- parently, this bitch has guarding functions in the winter dwelling. When they move from summer houses to the winter ones, along with the Master of the Fire they feed this bitch. Gilyak Mokley from the vil- lage Chai-vo told me, that she is fed thus: one stands with one's back to the door, pronounces the bitch's name and throws the tidbit, mos\ between one's legs toward the threshold. (1930:49)t In addition to the conceptual figure of Master and/or Mistress of the hearth and fire, who is ap- parently visualized simultaneously as an ancestral figure and protecting spirit of the dwelling, and condenses in itself all the members of the lineage and household, and in addition to the guardian spirits or spirit inhabiting the threshold, the Nivkh also conceptualize a spirit pertaining exclusively to the house, tyv yzt Master of the House (Taksami, 1961: 163). It is not clear if tyv yz is identical with the spirit residing in the rocks near the threshold and in the threshold itself - the spirit who clearly guards the entry. I am inclined to the view that tyv yz is a separate entity. He is the ultimate beneficiary of the "feeding of the house" and incorporates all elements of the house itself in his essence. How he (or she) is conceptualized by the Nivkh is not entirely clear (Shternberg, 1933:317). Images repre- senting tyv yz were carved by the Nivkh and kept tThe equivalence between men and dogs is dis- cussed in a separate section under World View. It is possible to interpret the above ritual as one of fertility. As pointed out in the section on Dogs in Nivkh life, women wear dog's teeth as insurance against infertility.</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 5a.

These images were dressed in symbolic clothing, made of pieces of white cloth and ritual wood shavings. Descriptions and illustrations of these images may be found in Shrenk (1903:111: Plate LV, LVII), Tak- sami (196l:l63:fig. 36) and Hawes (1904:194). According to Taksami the images of tyv yz were made on a shaman's instructions, and the spirit was conceptualized as the guardian of the well- being of all inhabitants of the house (Taksami, 1961:163-164). Offerings to tyv yz were made each fall, before the occupancy of the winter dwelling was resumed after the summer's interlude. In this case the ritual of "feeding" was preceded by a thorough scrubbing of the house, from the roof top to the floor which at this time was renewed by spreading a fresh layer of wet clay. Shternberg adds that the "feeding" could also be instituted at other times on the initiative of the head of the household (1933:317). If, in spite of all precau- tions , it was believed that hostile or malignant spirits had entered the dwelling, they could be expelled by a shamanistic rite (Shternberg, 1933: 318). In summer, the Nivkh occupied specially con- structed dwellings, often built on piles. These deserve special attention, as many authorities con- sider them very unusual for the area, finding similar construction types only among some Ugric peoples (Levin and Potapov, 1961:160). The storage houses and the ritual buildings, lezang, were also con- structed on the model of the summer dwellings. Summer dwellings were called ke ryv. The floor- plan was rectangular, varying in length from 36 to 45 feet. The construction combined features of log and frame methods. Shrenk reported only one type (1899:11:45-50), the pile dwelling. Taksami states that several types were in use (1961:136). The type described by Shrenk was built on two rows of piles, placed along the longitudinal axis of the building. On these piles long beams were set, sometimes directly, sometimes cushioned on thick short logs. Crosswise a subflooring of tightly packed poles was placed. On this subflooring a walled and roofed superstructure, consisting of two compartments, was erected. This superstructure did not extend the entire length of the subflooring, so that one end of the latter protruded, forming a sort of open verandah. Where the walls and the roof were joined, an air space allowed circulation. The roof was supported mainly by two posts, one in the center of each compartment, on which the main carrying beam rested. The roof had a double slope and was built of poles covered with bark. Entry was achieved by means of a notched log. As in the winter dwelling, sleeping benches ran along the walls. A single hearth was centrally located, the smoke escaping through an opening directly overhead. The first compartment served as storage room for fishing gear and tackle, household uten- sils and food supplies. Taksami reports that some- times summer dwellings served as storage areas for valuables, such prestige goods as bows and arrows, spears, pikes, chests, etc. (1961:139). However, other sources report that such items were stored in special barns. Storage barns for utilitarian goods called nie were of similar construction. These are described in detail by Taksami (1961:149-150). The ritual barn, lezang, located at the forest's edge, about half a kilometer from the settlement, near the ritual ground where the bear was killed, was of log construction and raised on piles (Taksami, 1961: 157). Any dwelling, speaking in a general sense, was lineage property, though within the lineage indi- viduals were recognized as owners of particular structures (Zolotarev, 1933:55). When a dwelling became vacant, it could be entered only by agnatic kinsmen. Members of unrelated lineages were for- bidden entry. Taksami writes: Even as late as 1956-1957 I observed the following facts: in the village Varki on the Amur Liman there were two storage houses with full complement of furnishings in- cluding such items as spears, lances, knives, etc. The owners had died and their lineage mates did not reside in any of the nearby settlements. In spite of the fact that many items of equipment and imple- ments of means of production needed by other people living in the village were stored there, the Nivkh, observing the im- memorial principle of lineage property, did not touch the storehouses (1967:165). In addition to winter and summer dwellings, storage structures and ritual barns, other structures associated with Nivkh settlements were the flimsy huts used for childbirth (Shternberg, 1933:305; Pilsudski, 1910:756; Taksami, 1961:135-136). Essen- tial features of these huts were the absolutely obliga- tory orientation of the entrance toward the east, and the location of the fire, on the ground, immediately inside the entry. A rock, heated until it was red- hot, was kept on this fire. Similar in construction were temporary shelters built in the summer at dis- tant fishing sites, and the hunting huts which in- dividuals built in the winter in their hunting terri- tories near their traps (Shternberg, 1933:313). These structures were either conical or double-sloped branch and bark creations, sometimes triangular, sometimes of rectangular floor plan. The most usual construction material was willow branches lashed together. Occasionally, such temporary shelters</page><page sequence="17">Black: The Nivkh J7 were built more substantially. A detailed descrip- tion and illustrations may be found in Levin and Potapov (1961:131-221) and Taksami (1961:144- 148). Taksami also describes structures utilized in fish processing and dog shelters. The latter are of interest as indicators of the special status of the dog in the Nivkh world view (Kreinovich, 1930: 29-30; Taksami, 1961:152-155). Dogs, like humans, had winter and summer residences and bitches about to whelp had special shelters located in the rear of the houses (Taksami, 1961:154). ///. TECHNOLOGY Fire Making.17 Fire was made with flint and tinder. The fire- making apparatus was a symbol of lineage unity, and as such, was the property of the lineage, to be kept by the oldest competent male agnatic kinsman. Lineage segments localized outside the original home territory of a given lin- eage possessed portions of the lineage flint and tinder. When lineage fission occurred, the flint and tinder were ceremonially divided, and it was said that "the fire was broken" to indicate the division of the group. A portion of the flint and tinder in such cases was given to the eldest male member of the departing group, who then lighted the new fire in the new location at the first bear festival (Shternberg, 1893:10). When the new dwellings were constructed, the first fire on the hearth was lit with the lineage flint and tinder by the eldest resident male agnate (Taksami, 1961: 160). Under ordinary circumstances only agnates could light the fire on the hearth, and only agnates could light candles or lamps. The hearth, the importance of which in the Nivkh conceptual world has been touched upon in the previous section, could be cleaned only in the morning. At the bear festival, fire could be lit only by means of the lineage flint and tinder (Shternberg, 1893:11). Fire making assumed a special significance at funerals, because disposi- tion of the body was by cremation. A still more ancient apparatus for fire making requiring the ef- fort of two men was used then and only then, when the fire to ignite the funeral pyre was produced by friction (Shternberg, 1893:16; 1933:327; Shrenk, 1903:111:133-136). All Nivkh carried flint and tinder pouches attached to their belts with which they did not part even in death. These were of fine work- manship, highly ornamented and the symbolic func- tion was never forgotten even on the most ordinary occasions or in cases of purely utilitarian use. No Nivkh ever omitted to "feed the fire," even just by a pinch of tobacco no matter when and where he lit it (see Fig. 15). Fishing. l% Fish was the staple of life, and the life of a Nivkh was regulated by the seasonal run of the great fish, especially salmon and sturgeon. However, in addition to the great seasonal effort, fishing in various forms was carried out throughout the year. Equipment to satisfy the requirements of each specialized task had been developed. The best descriptions of fishing methods and the variety of equipment is found in Shrenk (1899:11:204-222) and Taksami (1967:89-110). Smolyak provides some additional information (1960:110). Seines and nets of various sizes, mesh, and construction type were used. These were made of wild nettle fiber, or more rarely, of wild hemp. Nettles, Urtica dioical , were the main source of cordage. The women cut nettles in the fall, preparing them by curing in water. The stems so prepared were dried during the winter and tied in bundles. Thread of different thicknesses and strength was spun with spindles. The women used the finer thread for sewing as well as thread prepared from fishskins and animal sinews. Men twisted ropes and wove seines and nets. Rope making was geared to the prospective use. Ropes were plaited in various thicknesses, and the thickness measured by and expressed by the number of strands employed. As many spindles were used as were needed to achieve a certain number of strands. The same fibers and methods were used in the old times to make mail shirts, the characteristic Nivkh armor, and fiber face pieces for helmets (Shrenk, 1899:11:219-221; Levin and Potapov, 1961:256). For fishnets the fibers were cured by an infusion of larch bark (Taksami, 1967:92). The seines were made in strips, with the number and size of strips varying accord- ing to the type of fish to be caught. The size of the mesh was also determined in the same way. Smaller seines and nets were made for indi- vidual fishing, while large seines were usually used in large scale cooperative fishing enterprises. Co- operative fishing parties normally ranged from three to ten men, although occasionally larger parties were organized. In winter, ice fishing was practiced widely and several methods were in use. Nets and weirs were standard items of the technological in- ventory. Nets weighted down with sinkers and sus- pended from poles located on shore were also used. Often such nets were erected serially, primarily for night fishing in order to catch the salmon ascending the streams during the spawning season. On the seacoast, nets were placed in position at ebb tide and were emptied of fish carried in by the incoming tide at the next ebb. Such nets often remained in position the entire season. A very popular type of net was one that could be suspended from a single pole directly from shore, so that the use of boats for net placement became unnecessary. Special anchors secured this net to the bottom.

The mesh in such nets was often more than ten inches across. Large bag nets of at least two types were used for fishing from boats and for ice fishing. The larger net of this type required the cooperative labor of two men. Elaborate fish traps of various sizes, often very large indeed, were constructed along the streams. Typical was a trap, erected roughly per- pendicularly to the shore, of from one hundred and fifty to sometimes over six hundred feet in length. These were made of larch poles, lashed together crosswise, then reinforced by an additional row of poles at a lesser distance from each other. This underwater barrier was then extended downstream forming a rough L. Against the fence was placed a parallel structure made of sticks fastened to- gether with cross poles and lashed and twisted with twigs. This barrier extended from the river bottom to the top of the water. This device was employed for catching salmon. Fish were also caught by rods, hooks, gaffs and a variety of har- poons and hand nets (Taksami, 1967:92-110; Shrenk, 1899:11:204-236). Sea mammal hunting.19 The primary object of the sea mammal hunt was the seal. The Nivkh dis- tinguished terminologically at least fourteen types of seals (Kreinovich, 1934a:86; Austerlitz, 1968; Taksami, 1967:112). They hunted them all, in addi- tion to sea lions, dolphins, white whales and oc- casionally whales of other varieties. Possibly, but here the literature is contradictory, they at times hunted the killer whale, sometimes referred to in literature as fin- or sailfish (kasatka in Rus- sian), though this possibility seems rather unlikely. The sea animals were hunted from shore, boats and on ice; they were harpooned, gaffed, clubbed, trapped and shot. After Russian contact, the Nivkh were quick to adopt firearms and use them in hunt- ing sea mammals (Shrenk, 1899:11:231-233; Shtern- berg, 19 04b: 19). Seals were hunted both individually and in large cooperative parties. Individual hunting was confined, apparently, to the beginning of the sea- son, just before the break-up of the ice sheet in the month of quar long, which roughly corresponds to the end of February and beginning of March. In this "Raven Month" a Nivkh would travel along the frozen wastes of the sea on his dog sled. In his team would be one dog used to locate the breath- ing holes of the seals. The weapon used to catch a seal coming up for breath of air was the gaff and kite, illustrated in Smolyak (1960:119). Large scale cooperative enterprises began when the sea was relatively free of ice. Before the hunt could commence, it was important that all ritual observances due the Master of the Waters at the time of ice breaking be carried out as well as addi- tional special observances intended to ensure the success of the hunt. Only when every prescribed ritual action had been completed could prepara- tions for the voyage begin. Essential for the co- operative hunt was a large boat, which not every Nivkh owned. The owner of such a boat organized the task force for the occasion, preferring as mem- bers his af fines (wife takers) but usually ability and availability of a good man was the overriding factor in selection. Often the crew then became known and was called as "so-and-so's boat," the name of the owner being the point of reference (Kreinovich, 1934a:79-80). The owner of the boat had specific duties to ensure the presence and quality of all necessary equipment and performance of all necessary rituals; he was later responsible for the proper division of the catch, which was con- ducted on the basis of complete equality of all members, including the owner, who received in recognition only symbolic ownership of the first seal caught of a specific kind, very special in Nivkh ideology, and he had to perform a ritual at the time of the catch (Kreinovich, 1934a:86-87). Essential to success was the presence among the crew members of strong oarsmen, a good helmsman and a good shot, formerly with bow and arrow (or perhaps javelin), later with gun (Shternberg, 1893: 38; Kreinovich, 1934a:81). During the hunt, all members of the crew observed certain ritual rules, including the custom of not calling things and events by their proper, usual, names (Kreinovich, 1934a:78, 83, 84). The women also observed ritual prohibitions during the men's absence (Kreinovich, 1934a:85). The animals caught were ritually treated before being dressed. Particularly, they were "fed" with special grasses brought along for the purpose (Kreinovich, 1934a:86). Hunting the white whale was not a basic ele- ment in the Nivkh economy (Shrenk, 1899:11:235- 236), yet it occupied a place in Nivkh life far ex- ceeding its actual contribution to the economy. Kreinovich (1935:108-115) gives us a vivid picture of this hunt in the words of his informant, as well as in drawings sketched by the man as he told about the hunting of the white whale. When the Nivkh noticed the approach of white whales, a hunting party was rapidly organized and set out to sea. The object was to herd the animal into shallow waters. At a propitious moment, when the animal broke the surface, it was harpooned. After the white whale was played out, the Nivkh moved in for the kill. The proper way was to dispatch the beast with a single thrust of a spear into the breathing hole. After the kill, the carcass was towed to the village where an old woman drummed a beat on a log or a board. When the Nivkh brought in a white whale they beached the boat bow first, contrary to usual practice, when they</page><page sequence="20">20 Arctic Anthropology X-l 81 &lt;5 % . * 8 ¿I ^ *M vO 0) O^ CO ;j (0 Q&gt; co hs •S 2 5 -up e K 4-» ^) S8 2- o I ■sa fe S 8 -2 CO ■Sí fe v. co .^ .. i-H ti "•1 «I co</page><page sequence="21">Black: The Nivkh 21 landed stern first. On shore, the head of the white whale was laid on the board used to drum it ashore. The body was "fed" with various grasses of ritual significance, the gift of the land. The carcass was then divided among all village residents (Kreino- vich, 1935:108). The eyes, with certain ritual foods, were buried at the place set aside in the settlement for rituals to the Master of the Waters. The head itself was placed on a branch, in a cleft, and preserved in the special lineage space reserved for preservation of dolphin heads (Kreinovich, 1935: 109, 112-113). Boats.20 Boats were second in importance for the Nivkh only to dwellings. They were of two main types, large ones for sea hunting and fishing, and small flatboats or dugouts for shallow waters. The large sea-going boats, raw, were made of fir boards, with the bottom formed by a single slightly convex board, extending beyond the sides. The boards were worked with adzes or adze-type axes. The side boards were attached to the bottom board so that their edges were lower than the bottom, thus forming a pair of runners as on a sledge. The bow was shaped with two upward curving boards placed at a sharp angle to each other, and fastened to both the bottom and the side boards. The stern was formed by a board of trapezoid shape. No metal was used in boat construction, with wooden pegs serving the function of nails. Moss was used to caulk the cracks , then the frame was covered over with planks and tarred. Boats used for riverine fishing and sea hunting, as well as those used for long distance trading expeditions and voyages, were propelled by oars. The oars were rather mas- sive and over six feet long. Locks were used in pairs, with some boats having as many as six or more pairs of oars. Kreinovich noted five and six oarsmen in a seagoing boat (1934a:81). Shrenk's illustration of the water sacrifice at ice breaking time on the Amur (189 9: II: Plate XXXIX) shows thir- teen oarsmen and a helmsman. Ravenstein men- tioned a boat with forty Gilyak warriors (1861:23). The oarsmen sat on benches which were movable. The helmsman sat in the stern and steered with a smaller, shorter, square shaped oar. Sometimes, not too often, sails of fish skin were used. The building and operating of the boats was accompanied, as was almost any Nivkh activity, by ritual observances. The prows of the boats were decorated with carvings, highly stylized representa- tions of birds called ugn,* facing the sea (Kreino- vich, 1934a:82).** The bow was ornamented with designs in typical multicolored Nivkh patterns. For navigation of shallow waters and in narrow creeks the Nivkh used a dugout made of a single poplar trunk. This dugout w as propelled either by oars or a pole.t Birch bark canoes were also used, and these were propelled by paddles. Small flat- bottomed skiffs were also in use (Shrenk, 1899:11: 188-194). Sometimes, to facilitate the transport of goods, several dugouts were lashed together to form a very efficient barge. Rafts were known and used (Taksami, 1967:196-200). To propel the boats against the current, dogs were sometimes harnessed to them as motive power (Kreinovich, 1930b:36). Dog sleds. While summer transportation was largely by water, in winter the Nivkh depended on dog sleds and skis of several types. The traditional Nivkh sled, tut was of distinc- tive design, as was their manner of harnessing the dogs. At present, both have been replaced by the so-called Russian type of sled and harnessing method. The traditional sled drawn by the Nivkh dog team is today used only in races at bear festi- vals. In the Amur region, the Nivkh-type dog sled and harness were used by many other native groups, but scholars believe that the typical, original de- sign belongs to the Nivkh and was later borrowed by their neighbors (Levin and Potapov, 1961:56; Shrenk, 1899:11:167-175; Shternberg, 1904b:7). The Nivkh sled, or narta, to use the Russian technical term, was characteristically narrow and light. The wooden frame was fitted together, as in all types of Nivjch construction, without the use of metal, specifically without nails. Dovetail- ing was used, with one part inserted into drilled indentations in the adjoining part. On the frame rested a platform made of branch stems. The sleds ranged in length from nine to fifteen feet, were low (not more than twelve inches from the ground) and narrow (not exceeding one and a half feet in width). The runners were lined with whalebone or some other type of bone sheeting. The runner ends were finished with a bow-like semi-oval piece of wood. On long trips the Nivkh carried a crow's head on the sled for luck (Shrenk, 1899:11:128). The harnessing was distinctive. Dogs, five to seven or more per team, but always of uneven num- ber, were harnessed to the single main trace by ^According to Shrenk, ugn is Colymbus arcti- cus (Arctic Loon or Black-throated Diver) (1899:11: 251). **Space does not permit description of ritual decorations of boats.

The lead dog was harnessed directly to the trace. According to Taksami, teams as large as thirteen were used. The driver straddled the sled, his feet on short skis, and steered with two short braking sticks. Mostly, these sticks were used to brake sharply. Dogs were directed by voice commands. A leather thong attached to the driver's belt and to the rear end of the sled secured his position and helped him to stop (and to loose) his team when he jumped off or was thrown. When goods were loaded on the sled, they were firmly lashed down with leather thongs. The favorite material for sled construction was birch, considered especially desirable for the run- ners. The Nivkh sled was light, fast and could transport considerable weight. For household needs, the Nivkh used a smaller variant of the same sled model with harness for one or two dogs. These sleds were also used by hunters and as a child's toy. On festive occasions, such as weddings, the dog harnesses were decorated and the dogs were given a special head gear (Shrenk, 1899:11:173), called ruisk. Skis. Skis were a very important item of win- ter transportation, the favorite means of the forest hunters. The Nivkh used two types of skis, lakf and enr, both preferably made of larch or birch, long and relatively wide. The ends were finished in a semi-rhomboid or sharp-angled form with the front end bent upward. Lakf were unlined and used during the winter fishing expeditions to reach a fishing site, for wood cutting trips, or for visits to villages not too far away. This ski type was well suited for travel over deep snow, and was used occasionally in spring during hunting forays when the snow crust hardened. Otherwise, when hunting, when speed and silence were essential, the Nivkh used the en\ which were lined on the bottom with several layers of seal, moose and deer skins. Fish glue was used to attach the lining layers to the wooden frame and to each other. Sometimes these hunting skis were edged with whalebone. The Nivkh, according to Shrenk, used only one ski pole. The top of the ski pole comprised a small shovel with which the hunter used to remove the snow from his skis, excavate his traps which might have been covered by snow, bury automatic arrow release mechanisms and for a variety of other small tasks. Hard snow used to camouflage traps was also cut with this instrument (Shrenk, 1899:11:161- 164, 166). Each hunter possessed two or three pairs of skis, one for household use, the lakr, and prefer- ably two of the hunting skis, the enr (Taksami, 1967: 194-196). There were acknowledged master ski makers, usually old experienced hunters, who knew how the use of different animal skin linings guaranteed optimum efficiency under diverse weather and snow conditions, and ensured maximum speed and silence (Taksami, 1967:196; Shrenk, 1899:11:162-163). Hunting the Forest Animals. Although de- cidedly of secondary importance to Nivkh sub- sistence (Shternberg, 1933:246), hunting forest ani- mals was extremely important in their life, as it provided a source of wealth, thus giving the suc- cessful hunter a means to achieve personal prestige and become a candidate for community leadership roles (Shrenk, 1899:11:237). Whatever was caught in traps and snares even- tually found its way into the cooking pot, but the forest animals were hunted primarily for their pelts, an item of international trade and the currency with which an individual acquired prestige goods for bride gifts, fine payments, and conspicuous destruc- tion at funerals. Winter was the hunting season. Each lineage had hereditary hunting domains, and within each domain agnatically linked males who lived together, had hunting rights in certain designated portions of lineage domain (Kreinovich, 1936; Shrenk, 1899:11: 237). Most specifically, such division was ob- served with regard to streams, which were hunting sites for sables, and to fox holes (Shternberg, 1893: 34). Shelters, small storage huts, dressing and storage platforms were erected on these individual hunting sites (Taksami, 1967:144-148). In late fall, hunters travelled to the hunting sites to in- spect the condition of the old traps, prepare the new, repair equipment or shelters, and to deposit additional gear and provisions that they would need later. A hunter could have hunting huts in more than one location. Supplies were stored in all, in approxi- mately equal quantities. A man's right to hunt may not have been concentrated in a single or adjacent locations, but be valid on sites quite widely sep- arated. These preliminary trips, to ensure that all was in order for the coming season, usually lasted from two to three weeks. A short visit home fol- lowed, and then the hunter departed for the long winter hunt, interrupted only by brief occasional visits home. Usually the departure occurred approxi- mately in the middle of November, with observance of ritual actions designed to ensure the hunter's success. While the men were away, women were subject to ritual prohibitions. The season ended around March. In the forest, the hunter lived alone in his hut, inspecting his traps every three or four days. If the traps were widely separated, the hunter would spend the night in the shelter that was nearest to the trap he was attending or would build himself a temporary windbreak. No Nivkh under normal circum-</page><page sequence="25">Black: The Nivkh 25 stances would use the hunting hut of another. Only in case of dire need or extreme emergency would such use be considered permissible. When this occurred, the case was reported to the owner by the user, especially if the unexpected stay also required consumption of the other's food. If a hunter used another's shelter, he, as a matter of course, took care of any traps belonging to his un- knowing host and dressed and stored any animals caught, in repayment for shelter. Animals caught in traps or killed while out hunting were dressed and skinned immediately. Skins were stretched for drying in the nearest hunt- ing hut and left there in storage. The hunters main- tained themselves during the hunting season by means of food supplies brought in beforehand, by occasional fishing, and through consumption of the meat of any animal caught and killed: sables, squirrels, muskrats - anything and everything was eaten, with the sole exception of the domestic rat. The stored yukola, seal fat, sugar and cereals, brought to the hunting area in the fall, supplemented and varied this meat diet. At the end of the season all hunting gear, household utensils utilized by the hunter while in the forest, any movable furnishings in all huts be- longing to a single owner, were collected and stored for the summer in a single location. The hunting equipment of the Nivkh was very ingenious and of great variety. Their ancient hunt- ing gear was so well adapted to the purposes of the type of hunt engaged in that even today many Nivkh prefer their traditional equipment to modern ones. Sables were trapped mostly in noose and fall traps so designed as not to injure the animal's pelt. Some of these traps were constructed at tree hollows from sticks and branches and baited just inside the hollow. The animal was strangled by the falling stick he triggered when attempting to reach the bait. A log trap and a snare placed across a small stream frequented by sables was another variant. Several fox traps were in use. Automatic traps were used widely for all kinds of game. They differed in size and construction details, depend- ing on the prey. In all cases, the animals approach- ing the camouflaged trap automatically triggered a mechanism that released an arrow, or in the case of larger game, a javelin (Shrenk, 1899:11:238-244). The Nivkh did not use dogs in hunting forest ani- mals (Shternberg, 1904b:17). The bear was an important object of the hunt, and was sought cooperatively by groups of agnatic kinsmen. Usually, the object of a bear hunt was to capture the animal alive, but when circumstances made this impossible, the bear was killed (Shrenk, 1899:11:248-249). Also, if a member of the com- munity was killed by a bear, a party set out in pursuit to exact vengeance. If they were not able to overtake the actual criminal, they were obliged to kill not less than three other bears. Several types of bear traps were used, but most often the bear was located in its lair. While the entrance was blocked by stout poles and hunters with spears and pikes surrounded the possible routes of escape, the bear was roused. Bears were hunted primarily for ritual reasons. The meat of the killed animal was never eaten by the group who or- ganized the hunt but was distributed to wife- taking groups.* Other animals hunted for other than commercial reasons were wolf and lynx and, apparently, the fox. Traps were used normally, but for wolf and fox poison pellets were employed occasionally (Shrenk, 1899:11:243, 244). Hare also was hunted for ritual reasons in addition to utilitarian ends: the fur and especially the ears and head offered protection against a multitude of evil spirits infesting the normally benevolent domain of the water (Shrenk, 1899:11:87, 242, 243; Shternberg, 1933:303-304). Possession of lynx pelts was the highest sign of prestige a man could attain. Unfortunately, Shrenk, who described the effort and pride of the Nivkh in obtaining lynx pelts and garments - it was a man's pride to have his wife sport a lynx chapeau at the bear festival - was not able to obtain exegetical material on this usage. The wolf, as Shternberg describes it, was important in oath taking and ordeal-divinations (1933:303). Deer and moose were hunted, but rarely. The meat was divided among inhabitants of the settlement (Taksami, 1967: 126; Shrenk, 1899:11:247). Hand weapons used in the hunt did double duty as weapons of war. They were the compound bow, sheeted in horn (Shrenk, 1899:11:245-247), the spear, the lance, and the pike (in Russian rogatina - either single or double pronged)** (Shrenk, 1899:11: 247). The latter was utilized primarily in bear hunt- ing. Occasionally, the best and most experienced hunters went against a bear alone, armed only with a spear. If the hunt was cooperative, success would be achieved if the bear roused from his lair were captured alive, chained and lashed to a plat- form made of several sleds for triumphal delivery to the village. The height of jubilation, however, was occasioned by the capture of a she- bear with cubs who could be raised to maturity in captivity. Bird Hunting.24 A variety of birds, preferably waterfowl, but not excluding even sea gulls, were *The exceptions to this rule, such as ven- geance killing of a bear and ritual of lineage fu- sion, will be discussed in detail elsewhere. **Nivkh rogatina seem to have been exclusively of single pronged type.</page><page sequence="26">26 Arctic Anthropology X-l ¿f* £1-2 •o ^ tS 0) c p e co o 111 S co S ¿ q) +j « ^r M r1 /ri h M ¡111 r1 /ri h M á ft o o ° 5 o&gt; ^ no a £ ^ §2 e is e « u « g O Si* &lt; 22 ? 55 SU 8S?S *ib&gt;3 2 - -0 8 a 2-g - -0 a « »« § §• e</page><page sequence="27">Black: The Nivkh £7 •8 . « s x 8 ® io I 8 £ o S w (0 ^ (0 (0 g «I •a g "8 a w g o&gt; o ^* O c &gt; ja w « «2 IS w !S P ¿•01 o Q g «IS CO 18 (0 (D M-l</page><page sequence="28">28 Arctic Anthropology X-l captured and the flesh was eaten (Shrenk, 1899:11: 250-257). The crow, Corvus corone, however, was never eaten (Shrenk, 1899:11:127). Feathers of several species were used in ritual (but not the sea eagle's) and others for feathering arrows. Sea eagles of two species were hunted, or rather their nests located and the fledglings removed, to be raised in captivity for commercial reasons: later, their feathers would be traded to the Japanese (Shrenk, 1899:251-252; Shternberg, 1904b:II:40-41). However, bird hunting was a minor and, ideologi- cally speaking, unimportant enterprise in Nivkh life. The weapons used were small arrows, ending in a multipronged wooden head spiked with iron nails (Shrenk, 1899:11:246). During the molting season, the birds were simply clubbed with sticks. For ptarmigan, grouse and partridge, snares were used (Shrenk, 1899:11:251; Taksami, 1967:127). Weapons. zs Before the imposition of Pax Ros sia, the Nivkh had a reputation as fierce war- riors. Shrenk, Ravenstein and other early travellers often heard tales of past battles from the Nivkh themselves and especially from their neighbors. Shternberg, too, alludes to tales of past war deeds. The neighbors, of course, were especially eloquent on the ferocity and cruelty of Nivkh warriors (Raven- stein, 1860:X:78-112). De Brunière, a French Jesuit missionary in the service of the Chinese Empire, unquestionably suffered death at the hands of the Nivkh in the classic pattern of martyrdom (Raven- stein, 186O:X:78-112). One of Shrenk 's informants was reportedly a member of the war party that dis- patched De Brunière, and Shrenk leaves no doubt that a great deal of the prestige this man enjoyed among his fellows stemmed from this experience (Shrenk, 1899:11:78, footnote; 1903:111:35, footnote). Historical records documenting the Russian pene- tration and settlement of the Amur area show that Cossaks met very fierce resistance in the Nivkh area (Shrenk, 1883:1:84). It is reported that Nevel- skoy met with armed resistance when attempting to start construction at the site of the present-day Nikolaevsk (Shrenk, 1883:1:87-89) and had to bring reinforcements. Shternberg states that he recorded many tales about wars against the Ainu (1904b:5-part I) but does not give any specific de- tails. More important, inter- lineage warfare was common and ruthless - all males regardless of age were subject to slaughter. This strife ceased only when the Russian administration moved against it, though sporadic small scale outbreaks still oc- curred. It is not known when the gun reached the Nivkh (Shrenk, 1899:11:274-275), but guns were popular among them by the time Shternberg conducted his research. The traditional weapons were bow and arrow (though the Nivkh, unlike some of their neighbors, are reported not to have used poison), knives and daggers, but by far the most favored was the spear. While knives were the pride of each adult male, the spears exceeded them in im- portance. These latter were magnificent iron- pointed weapons, elaborately inlaid in symbolic designs with silver and copper. Parties pursuing an eloping pair or a run-away wife were customarily armed with spears. Clubs, reminiscent in form of maces, were also in use. Unique was a fighting stave, or as Shrenk styled it, a dueling weapon, which in his opinion was largely ceremonial (Shrenk, 1899:11:260-261). Shternberg describes the dueling technique which Nivkh boys were taught from a very young age (1893:41). Weapons were treasured; they formed part of the prestige goods by which the status of a man and a lineage was measured. They were used, al- though owned by individuals, for lineage needs: as fines in blood feud settlements, bride gifts for impecunious lineage members, or funeral offerings for a kinsman. Armor was known, though to what extent it was used in ancient times is not. The Nivkh used two types of armor, presumably of native origin: one of nettle cordage and the other which was a vest that combined metal plates with leather thongs. The latter may, however, have been borrowed from the Manchu. Helmets, with a leather and fur crown worn over a fiber neck and face covering and richly decorated, were in use in ancient times. A more "modern" looking helmet was reported by Shrenk (1899:II:Plate XLIV). Also in more modern times Japanese armor, obtained in trade, was in use (Shrenk, 1899:11:258-260). Armor for a Nivkh was the most treasured pos- session and inheritance passed from father to son. Household tools and utensils.26 It is impossible to describe or even list all objects of the Nivkh traditional household inventory that were absolutely essential to the well-appointed home. Each indi- vidual family resident in a dwelling had storage trunks and chests for personal possessions, which were made of wood and often elaborately carved. Smaller containers of birch bark were also elabo- rately decorated with traditional designs in the basic Nivkh colors: red, black, white and blue. Cradles were an important item of this inven- tory. These were of two types, destined for day and night use respectively. Over the family sleeping place the daytime cradles were suspended from the rafters by thongs so placed that the angle and height could be adjusted. The night-time cradle, of simpler construction and made of birchbark, was kept on the bench next to the child's mother. The daytime</page><page sequence="29">Black: The Nivkh 29 cradle lined with short-haired dog skin, the same material that was used to wrap the infant, was fitted with an opening with an attached birchbark container into which the excretions flowed. The infant was secured in the cradle by thongs. Often mobiles made of various objects appropriately associated with the child's sex were suspended in front of the cradle (Shrenk, 1903:111:13; Kreino- vich, 1930:96-97). Eating utensils were various. The main item was a small wooden table held over one's lap at meals. This was elaborately carved. On this lap table were placed various dishes, bowls or simply food. Other eating utensils were wooden spoons, bowls and various other wooden vessels of a vari- ety of shapes and kinds. Preferred for cooking purposes were metal kettles of Chinese and Japa- nese workmanship, with Japanese wares most highly valued. Particularly desirable were metal tripods; these were classed as prestige goods and most often formed part of bride gifts and blood feud settlement fines. Birchbark buckets were widely used, and ap- parently in earlier times cooking pots were made of bark or wood covered with clay or earth. The Nivkh had a variety of tools for working the skins of animals and fish. The knives for fish dressing were part of every woman's possessions and always worn at her belt. Men had a variety of knives for different purposes. The knife used ex- clusively for working (carving) wood deserves special mention. Needles, needle-cases, burins, axes and adzes were all in use (Shrenk, 1899:1 SB- IS?). Many tools had one and only specific func- tion. Thread for sewing was made of nettle and hemp fibers, sometimes of animal sinew. In later times colored threads were traded from the Chinese as they were popular among women for embroidery. Thongs of dolphin and seal skin strips were used for a variety of purposes. Animal skins were used for pallets and coverings, both indoor and outside. Tobacco pipes, usually traded from the Chinese, were in universal use and treasured personal pos- sessions. Men, women, children, all smoked to- bacco, often with a single pipe, lit by the host, being passed around the circle assembled around the hearth. The pipes were of a variety of materials. Toys for children were made from many ma- terials, although mostly of wood. The Nivkh apparently did not know the crafts of weaving and pottery, but traded items they de- sired from the Chinese, the Japanese and later from the Russians (Shrenk, 1899:11:137-142). Some authorities, notably Levin and Okladnikov, as well as Shrenk, believed that these crafts were known and practiced in earlier times but disappeared pos- sibly with the influx of superior goods from China (Shrenk, 1899:11:137-138, 309). Pottery is common archaeologically in this general region, but cannot be assigned with certainty to the ancestors of the Nivkh. Clothing.2* Traditional Nivkh clothing was very distinctive. The basic materials were fish skins, seal skins, and animal furs. In historic times, silks and cottons imported primarily from China, but later also from Japan, became popular and formed part of summer clothing, and, especially for the ladies, parts of "Sunday- go- to- meeting" attire. Bolts of yard goods of foreign manufacture formed a large part of prestige goods stores; it was considered especially fitting to use both of these to dress the corpse and in conspicuous destruction at funeral ceremonies. Outer winter clothing was made from dog fur and seal skins. The selection of the skin by color was of particular importance. For men, these outer garments were made of a single color, preferably dark, black or dark brown, and the skins matched as closely as possible. No such pains were taken with women's garments, but children's coats were often made in elaborate patterns fitting different colored skins in a certain order. In length, these coats went to the knee or below; they were wide and roomy, and lined with a second layer of fur made from the pelts of young animals or puppies. Here the color selection mattered less. Often this garment, basically made of dog fur, was trimmed with fur of foxes, muskrats, squirrels, or sables. However, in addition to a work-a-day coat, each father strove to provide his daughters with coats of costly furs. Fox was favored, but the most treasured ones were those made of lynx. The latter usually belonged to men, and the possession of such a coat was an indication of economic status, a sign of true wealth. Lynx, as mentioned earlier, was hunted for its fur and never traded. Each Nivkh woman hoped to own a lynx hat, made so that the animal's ears graced the crown and the tail formed a decoration in the back, to wear on such occasions as a bear festival. Apparently, luck in the lynx hunt was an indication that, in general, fortune smiled upon a man. Coats made of noble furs formed an important part of funeral garments and even today old folk hoard fur mantles toward the day of their death (Taksami, in Iva no v, 1970:177). An interesting item of men's attire was kos'k, a short kilt or skirt- like garment, made of choice seal skin and worn over the outer coat. Its function was to protect the lower part of the body against wetness, snow and wind on the hunt and when oper- ating a dog sled. Especially handsome, large- spotted skins were chosen to make a kos'k . At the belt-line this garment was edged with a double strip</page><page sequence="30">30 Arctic Anthropology X-l Fig. 13.

The bottom was also edged in a contrasting color, purely for decorative effect. In winter men wore leggings, made also from double layers of fur. Men wore boots of seal skin or more often of fish skin. These boots were of indigenous cut, specifically Nivkh, and had a drawstring fastening the boot at the calf so as to prevent snow from penetrating inside the boot. A winter hat, mittens and belt completed the outfit. Winter hats were of several types. One of the most common , the hak , was worn without earmuffs. It was made of deer or seal skin and lined inside with fur. The other popular hat type was worn over ear- muffs, had a deep crown encompassing the head and was made of a variety of furs: squirrel, muskrat, sable and lynx. Earmuffs were made of seal skin and lined with fox or squirrel fur. The outside was richly embroidered. Mittens also were made of seal skin and dog, deer, fox, or sable fur. Usually, furs formed the lining. Over mittens was worn a cover of fish skin. A special mitten worn by men when hunting had not only a separate thumb but also an index finger. The cuff was sometimes flared, gathered and in all cases richly embroidered or decorated. Working mittens were less elaborate and sometimes had a slit in the cuff at the wrist which enabled the fisherman to pull his hand out- side, without removing the mitten, if it was neces- sary to untangle a fishline or a trapline. The final, and in the Nivkh view, most important item of men's dress was the belt. A Nivkh wore his belt winter and summer. Although women wore belts also, these did not have the same significance as did belts for men. A man's belt was made of seal skin, and a set array of items was attached to it: flint and tinder, the latter in a special pouch; a variety of knives, from the dagger used as a weapon to fish cutting and wood carving ones; a tobacco pouch; a drill or piercing tool used to untie knots and pierce holes in skins; a pipe cleaner; a needle case; and various amulets to ensure good fortune under all possible circumstances. The belt was an absolutely indispensable part of the funeral gar- ments. The Nivkh in full traditional regalia was an imoosina fiaure; Dressed in a black dog fur coat, belted at the waist, against which in effective con- trast is the soft grey skirt made of the skins of young seals, shod in boots with narrow tips elegantly tailored, in a hat of fox paws, with earmuffs, fur gloves that cover the sleeve edges, a Gilyak made a really dash- ing impression (Shternberg, 1933:25). Women's winter clothing was similar to that of the men. The women were particularly conscious of hat fashions, and, as mentioned earlier, the heart's desire of every woman was a lynx hat. Failing that, bonnets were made of Chinese brocades, trimmed and lined with soft furs, preferably fox. Muskrat was the choice for edgings. For ordinary use, hats were made of heavy cloth lined with fur. Since fashions change, in more recent times hats made of squirrel pelts or young deer skin came into favor (Taksami, in Ivanov, 1970:181-183). Summer hats, possibly borrowed from the Nanai, were worn mostly by men, seldom by women, who usually went bareheaded in summer. Made of birch- bark, these were conical in shape and elaborately decorated with red and black birchbark appliques, a typically Nivkh feature, the ornamentation con- sisting of spirals running in rays from the tip of the hat to its rim. Sometimes, men in summer wore high conical hats, presumably of Chinese origin. Indoors , in winter, both men and women wore robes. Similar robes were worn in summer as out- door clothing. Different materials, though, were chosen for each garment respectively. A man's robe was shorter than a woman's, reaching just above the knee. Robes always closed the left over right lapel and were fastened with three buttons. Men's robes had pockets sewn into the right lapel. Dark colors were preferred. Men's robes were un- decorated, except for edging along the left lapel and at the sleeves. The edging was also made of cloth but in a contrasting color or a different shade of the color of the robe. The entire garment was cut in one piece; the sleeves were not set in. Men in summer sometimes wore short coats of fish skins that were richly decorated in traditional patterns. Women too, and more frequently than men, wore robes made of fish skins (Taksami in Ivanov, 1970: 177-179). Although the working clothes of women were untrimmed, garments worn on visits or during religious festivals, whether of fish skin or cloth, were always richly adorned. If the robe was made of cotton, a wide border of a contrasting color was attached. Along the hem women's robes had two rows of thin copper discs or Chinese coins fastened just above the edging with short leather thongs. The hem could also be trimmed by a variety of shells. Glass beads were used occasionally to trim the neckline. The neck was usually collarless, but at times some women made a small stand up collar. The festive robes had designs on the back. The method of decoration, in colors of black, red and blue, was usually applique if a fish skin garment was involved, embroidery if cloth was used. The process of fish skin applique was very elaborate. Several layers of fish skin, worked to the desired degree of pliability and fineness, were glued to- gether with fish glue. Color was applied to the lower layers, designs cut in the next. By repeating this procedure, multicolored effects were achieved</page><page sequence="33">Black: The Nivkh 33 \i\MiK\im ÜíiSIItpIllI! ^H ^¿ «-I CO M-l M-l &gt; M-l 'U -Í-» &lt;D -^ (O &lt;D^</page><page sequence="34">34 Arctic Anthropology X-l Fig. 16. a, Birchbark bucket (1), shoulder yoke for buckets (2), iron kettles of Japanese and Manchu origin (3,4), iron ladle (5), wooden food dishes and chopsticks (6, 7), birchbark dish (8); b wooden trough (1), wooden bowls (2, 3), lap table (4), wooden ladles (5, 6), wooden spoon (7), board for chopping tobacco (8), drainage board placed under infant's cradle (9); c, winter costumes (all from Shrenk).</page><page sequence="35">Black: The Nivkh 35 in the finished product. Patterns cut from birch- bark were passed on from mother to daughter as treasured possessions. Skill in making clothes, and especially the creation of decorative designs, was an extremely desirable quality in a Nivkh girl viewed as prospective bride. No young woman who was not a master of this craft and of embroidery as well would have been considered a good marriage prospect by a Nivkh male. Materials utilized in the craft of applique and embroidery were varied. Colored cloth, stripped or unravelled, thread, traded from the Chinese, dyed fish skin strips, mostly blue and red, birchbark dyed in various colors with vegetable dyes, and deer, elk and possibly dog hair were used. The Nivkh wore undergarments, consisting of cloth underpants and undershirts, of trade goods, in shades ranging from grey to blue. White, asso- ciated with power, violence and the sea, was not deemed desirable. A unique garment was the breast- warmer, an artfully constructed item of pentagonal shape, of cloth and fur, richly embroidered. It was worn over the naked body, held in place by thongs fastened around the neck. Favored colors were once again red, blue, black, and white. Kneehose made of seal skin was worn, fastened under and over the knee with thongs. The Nivkh also wore a type of loincloth or penis covering. This garment was obligatory for boys beginning at approximately seven years of age. Shternberg styled this garment "pants of modesty" and mentions that it was not in- cluded in the attire of a corpse before the funeral. Both men and women wore earrings. Usually of spiral shape and made of silver or copper wire, some were very elaborate, consisting of several interlocking spirals, that formed a long pendant, with jade disks and glass beads inserted into the metalwork. However, the main object of wearing the earring was not merely decorative, but to pre- serve the hole in the earlobe. Souls of persons with unpierced ears had difficulty reaching the land of the dead, for an old woman guarding the passage was thought to intercept such unfortunates, causing them to perish. In this connection it should be noted that the Nivkh, who to some degree believed in reincarnation of souls, considered the presence of small holes in the earlobes of a newborn child as a sign that the infant was the reincarnation of the soul of a dead kinsman (Kreinovich, 1930a:100- 101). Iron Smithing. The Nivkh used iron and other metals - silver, copper and bronze - which they worked themselves, though they did not mine the ores. They were skilled weapons miths. Inhabitants of the village of Chilkh or Khylk apparently were the specialists and it is possible that this trade was not open to anyone but was hereditary. Unfortu- nately, the literature does not present any conclu- sive evidence and this is merely a hypothesis. The most detailed evidence comes from Shrenk: On the one hand the Gilyak have too little material to produce weapons in large quan- tities, on the other hand they value these weapons too much, especially those of bet- ter workmanship. Therefore, they do not use them ordinarily, are very reluctant to sell them to strangers, and mostly preserve them as capital, which is passed on through inheritance, and is put into circulation only in case of great need, such as acquisition of a wife. But even in these cases weapons only change masters, but do not leave Gilyak hands. Moreover, weapon production under conditions of lack of ample resources for it, demands large expenditure of time and skill, not open just to anyone. During my stay on the Amur, most famous for the weapon production was the village of Khyl'k located upstream near the village Pat1. From there, I am told, come the samples pictured . . . which I brought from Tebakh . . . Unfortunately, when I visited this village I did not appreciate its importance in Gilyak industry (1899:11:252) The Nivkh forge employed a double bellows, requiring the labor of two men simultaneously. It was distinct from the forge methods employed by the Sakhalin Ainu though there were certain similar- ities. Shrenk believed ironsmithing to have been borrowed from the Japanese (1881-1895:111:567-569) but his argument is not particularly convincing and he presents no real evidence for this hypothesis. The process of Nivkh metal working is described in detail by Shrenk (1899:11:252-257). They made ele- gant knives, daggers, harpoon points and hooks, metal-tipped arrows and a variety of other metal tools and utensils, but, above all, the spears and lances. Their raw materials were the metal goods traded from the Chinese and Japanese, melted down, and reforged to their own satisfaction (Shrenk, 1899: 11:258; Kreinovich considered that the Nivkh borrowed the use of gold, lead and pewter from the Manchu (1955:152). Food. The main item of Nivkh diet was fish. Fresh fish was preferably eaten raw though in sum- mer some varieties were cooked. The consumption of cod, Gadus wachnja, was apparently subject to ritual observances; it may have been eaten only raw without any condiments whatsoever, and it could not be stored inside the dwelling other than in an open container, vessel or basket (Shrenk, 1899:11:120). Fish broth was a standard item of the menu. Sea-</page><page sequence="36">36 Arctic Anthropology X-l Fig. 17.

Raw fish was cooked into thin strips re- sembling, says Taksami, noodles, then mixed with wild onion and garlic and occasionally with added chopped bone cartilage of large fish (1967:183). In historic times, the Nivkh used salt, often to season fish, but this item they apparently obtained rather late from the Chinese. In earlier times, the fish was dipped in brine prepared by burning drift- wood from the sea and placing the ashes in bark containers. These were covered with fresh water and let stand until a salty infusion resulted, in which the ash settled to the bottom. Old dishes for serving fish had rather deep curved indenta- tions on the sides for the brine (Kreinovich, 1934a: 94). The main staple, however, especially in winter, was yukola, jerked, sundried, boned fish strips. Yukola was preferably made of two types of salmon, Salmo lagocephalus and Salmo proteus , and was of different quality and sorts. The type made with the skin and fat on was preferred, the other, made of fish meat only, was considered inferior. In win- ter yukola formed the base for many dishes, not the least for mos\ a dish without which no ritual feast was complete. It may be described as an aspic, having the consistency of sour cream (Shrenk, 1899:11:117), and made of pulverized y ukola and fish skins to which were added water, seal fat and berries. Taksami states that only fish skin was used as the base for mosr and that the originally liquid dish congealed so that it could be cut (1967: 184). Caviar (fish roe) was dried and preserved in salted and fresh form. Unsalted caviar was felt to relieve thirst on long marches (Taksami, 1967:183). Most fish in winter were boiled, with a few excep- tions of ritual significance (though on this point there are some inconsistencies in sources). Roast- ing and frying were considered uich, a sin or abomi- nation, permitted only in ritual reversals. Sea mammal meat was eaten, but was not con- sidered choice, the fat being preferred. Seals, dolphins, sea lions and white whales were animals whose meat was consumed. Whales were eaten when a carcass fell fortuitiously to the Nivkh, but they were not considered desirable food. Kidneys, hearts and stomachs were eaten raw. Burning sea mammal fat was considered uich - a blasphemous transgression sure to bring misfortune. During the cremation of the dead, no garment made of sea mam- mal skin could be thrown on the funeral pyre. In general, roasting and frying of meat was viewed with suspicion, even when done by ethnographers. Great quantities of smelts were caught and dried; these were considered a delicacy when dipped in seal fat. Seal fat was used both in food and for light. It was preserved by a process of fermentation in vats or troughs left open in the sun until a clear liquid was formed. Any remnant of the solid matter was discarded. As mentioned in the section on hunting forest animals, meat of any animal killed was consumed, although this source of provender was not con- sidered the best. However, deer and elk meat was eaten. When such an animal was killed, the meat was divided among all inhabitants of the village. Dog meat was widely consumed but dogs were not raised for meat as such. Consumption occurred only in ritually defined situations and the eating of dog flesh far exceeded the purely utilitarian mean- ing. The same situation pertained to bear meat, which was never consumed outside of ritual action. Birds which were snared were rarely eaten. Vegetable foods, gathered by women and children, were mostly used as condiments. Berries in variety, primarily of the cranberry and raspberry type, includ- ing loganberries, huckleberries, and the like, were used, as were elderberries, rowanberries , wild rose hips and bird cherries. Berries gathered in summer were stored in birchbark containers and frozen for winter use. Wild fruits and nuts, including wild apples, cedar and hazel nuts, were gathered. Herbs of several kinds, some of them aromatic, were em- ployed in certain rituals. I was not able to find among the sources a study specifically pertaining to Nivkh pharmacopaeia, which surely must have been extensive. Certainly, this subject merits further study. Other foods included edible roots, primarily of the allium and lily families, such as wild garlic and onion, for example, as well as mosses, fungi, algae, sea cabbage, and other edible seaweeds. Almost no information is available on the pos- sible consumption of mollusks. The inference is that if consumed at all, mollusks formed an insig- nificant part of Nivkh diet. Cereals and legumes, mostly rice, millet and peas, were traded from the Chinese and Tungus/ Manchu agriculturists. These were considered luxury foods and served only at festive gatherings. Alcohol, in the form of Chinese raki , was known and had been used since ancient times but apparently in moderation, though Chekhov, in dis- agreement with Shrenk, thought they were all turning into habitual drunkards. Tea, obtained from the Chinese, was the most popular drink. With the Russian settlement in the area, vegetable gardening began to take hold, especially potato growing. Bread and flour, introduced by the Russians, found quick favor among the Nivkh. The Nivkh were acquainted with salt and sugar. While the former had negative ritual associations (for example, no salt could be used during the bear festival), sugar, an import, was considered on the contrary to have beneficial connotations and was a very popular though rare item in the diet. Fish and seal, however, provided the staff of life.</page><page sequence="40">40 Arctic Anthropology X-l 15 Q&gt; fl)TJ - « WS | - •¿ (O O h o&gt; o -^ DC d 10 5 2 "111-* ÍJ&gt;« o gt- . ° ?-oi2; ss .

ART, MUSIC AND FOLKLORE Plastic and Graphic Art.*0 Nivkh art was distinguished from that of the other Amur tribes by its emphasis on wood carving, which was lacking among the Tungus/Manchu. The discussion of Nivkh art hinges on one's definitions. There was no "art for art's sake" in Nivkh society and yet, viewed in another dimension, art dominated and gave character to most objects produced. But, when one characterizes Nivkh art as "utilitarian," this phrase fails to do it justice. There is no satisfactory study of Nivkh art available and nothing dealing with wood carving.* Outside of the Soviet Union, only Berthold Laufer has published an analysis of Nivkh ornamental pat- terns (1902; 1900). Unfortunately, Laufer's analysis suffers from two shortcomings. The first is his preconceived viewpoint, predicated on his preoccu- pation with the historical reconstruction of traits spread through diffusion. He believed that primi- tive art was derivative of higher forms, and that the art of the Amur region was derivative from Chi- nese and Japanese sources, with that of the Nivkh, as the most remote from the postulated centers of diffusion, representing the least appealing. Still, he must have entertained doubts, because at times he had to face and explain facts inconsistent with his diffusionist view. He recognized that Nivkh art had a special character that set it apart from the similar but clearly distinct artifacts of their neigh- bors. Such was his preoccupation with the theory that the Nanai (Gold) developed their art from con- tact with Chinese and Japanese cultures and that the Nivkh in turn derived their culture from the Nanai, that he refused to examine the situation objectively. Laufer even went so far as to take issue with Leopold von Shrenk who had noted the extraordinary strength, vitality and originality of Nivkh artifacts, charging that "He [Shrenk] empha- sized the peculiarity of the Gilyak ornaments which are totally different from those of all other Siberian tribes" rather than looking for similarities among them. He asserts that "Shrenk 's investigations were unduly devoted to the Gilyak, and in his pre- dilection for these he likes to hold them up as superior to all other tribes of the Amur country" (Laufer, 1902:7). Moreover, Laufer insisted that the Nivkh had a "most striking . . . lack of ability to draw human faces or forms," concluding that Shrenk was mistaken when he reported the existence of highly stylized "crude and primitive representa- tions of the human face" (Shrenk, 1881-1895:111:2: 402). However, other investigators, such as Shtern- berg, Kreinovich, Zolotarev and Taksami did not find any such lack on the part of the Nivkh. To the contrary, these observers confirmed that stylized anthropomorphic images existed and, just as Shrenk had said, they were of symbolic significance. An example is the odn chongr, a rudely indicated face on seal harpoons and the hooked poles that secure nets for winter fishing and tyv yzt house protectors or figurines. Laufer denied the existence of any symbolic significance in Nivkh art. The second serious drawback in Laufer's presen- tation is his deliberate exclusion of a whole range of art because, "they embody only the particular attributes required in the special case in question" (1902:5). In these categories, excluded from con- sideration by Laufer's definition, were ritual ob- jects, amulets, shamanistic paraphernalia, objects used in healing ceremonies, symbolic ornaments on houses and fishing equipment, boat figureheads and last, but by no means least, the elaborate mortuary memorials including the stunning "Birds of Violence" - stylized sculptures on a polished, uprooted tree stump in the shape of flying birds often with human limbs, placed upon the cremation sites of murder victims. Laufer thus confined him- self exclusively to the examination and analysis of ornamental designs, what he termed "abstract art." It was in these that he found everything to be deriva- tive. There is a third, purely methodological (from an anthropologist's point of view) shortcoming in Laufer's work. He did not examine patterns as a whole, but broke down each pattern into constituent design elements, and then compared each element with similar elements in the designs of other Amur tribes. Furthermore, he looked for similarities in Chinese and Japanese parallels. Often he did not even identify the object from which the design had been taken (a spiral or a band, for example) so that one can only guess if it had been made by an Ul'ch or Nanai or Orok or Nivkh. That Laufer's interpreta- tion of the art of the Amur peoples is inadequate may be demonstrated by examining some of his general statements. He noted that "artistic representations of the bear in wood carving are limited to be used by the Gilyaks at their bear festivals '■ and that "this animal, however, is never represented in draw- ings or paintings. " He fails to substantiate this claim.** He wrote that Nivkh art is "first and fore- most imbued with Chinese spirit" but that there was *Except for Ivanov, S. V., Arikhitekturnyi ornament narodov Nizhnego Amura, Sbornik Museia Antropologii i Etnografi!, 1953, v. 15, pp. 234-290, which deals strictly with dwelling decora- tion. **Readers interested in this point should con- sult Kreinovich, 1934b:185,186; also see Hawes, 1904:195.</page><page sequence="42">42 Arctic Anthropology X-l no "en masse Chinese importation." He says: "Its [art's] basis rests undeniably in China. In the course of time the Amur tribes appropriate Chinese forms for themselves and very likely developed them independently." Yet those tribes that so slavishly, in Laufer's opinion, copied the higher Chinese forms of art failed to understand or acquire Chinese traditions and hence their art is devoid of symbolic significance. On the other hand, Chinese traditions entered into what must have been a cul- tural vacuum, in Laufer's view, and therefore, it should not be surprising "... that the traditions regarding the meaning of certain patterns are fuller, and have been preserved in the minds of these naive unlettered tribes than in the fast fading memories of a writing nation" (Laufer, 1902:2). Yet on the very next page Laufer contradicts himself when he feels called upon to comment on the origi- nal features of the art of the Amur tribes: "If the patterns of the Amur tribes were derived from China it is most astounding that exactly corresponding devices have never before been discovered in that country, nor adequate explanations obtained for related ones." Siberian art, says Laufer, must be considered "an independent branch of East Asiatic art, which sprang from the Sino- Japanese cultural centre" (1904:4). Shrenk, who collected a great quantity of arti- facts of the Amur region and had the opportunity to examine many more, pointed out that not only had the art of the Amur region "even among the Tungus" little in common with the art of the Northern Tungus and what is now termed the "Interior" of Siberia, but that it was quite distinct from Chinese art. Laufer cites Shrenk - only to deny any validity to his view: "... and its [art's] display in the Amur country, does not decrease, but increases with distance from the most influential cultural people, the Chinese, and culminates among the Gilyak, who live furthest away from them. ..." Laufer comments: "On my journeyings my observations led, first of all, to the deduction of the prevailing law, namely that the nearer the people live to a centre of Chinese culture, the higher the develop- ment of their art; the farther they recede from it, the less their sense of the beautiful. The art of the Gilyak of Sakhalin is very poor and undevel- oped; they possess a limited number of ornaments, and are unable to produce complicated compositions like those found on the mainland, as they them- selves assured me. The farther east one goes, the more destitute, and the farther west, the more gorgeous, is the display of art, which reaches its climax in and around Khabarovsk" (Laufer, 1902:7). This view is simplistic, to say the least. Let us consider some of those artifacts Laufer excluded from considerations. The mortuary houses, the raf, with their stylized human figurines representing the dead, carved in symbolic designs; or the "picto- graphs" described by Kreinovich (1934b: 184- 186), which tell the story of each bear killing in sym- bolic patterns which only an "educated reader" among the Nivkh can decipher properly so as to understand the full meaning and significance. And what about all those amulets and "charms" so cavalierly excluded because they had a specific purpose? One should expect matters to be better in the Soviet Union, where the study of Siberia's primitive peoples has been given a great deal of attention; unfortunately, this is not so. When S. V. Ivanov devoted his time to the study of the art of Siberian peoples, he too followed a cross-cultural compara- tive method, tracing the elements of design, nor is he, too, averse to stressing Chinese influences. Ivanov isolated what he calls the "Amur-Sakhalin Type of Decorative Ornament - Type VIII," including here Nivkh, Ul'ch, Orok, Oroch, Negidal, Nanai and Udekhe (in Levin and Potapov, 1961:392-393, 428). This decorative ornament he characterizes as: curvilinear geometric, large scale predomi- nantly zonal, with rosettes occurring in embroidery and strongly symmetrical. Bright colors predominate. Often stylized zoomorphic motifs are included, the local such as reptiles, fish, birds, deer, as well as Manchu-Mongol-Chinese. Not unfre- quently in this ornament is included the Chinese meander, the "Yin-Yan" figure resembling Chinese coin [chokk]. The spiral ornament, depending on the material utilized, shows certain specific peculiar- ities. In embroidery, applique and on birch bark, the spiral designs are characterized by complicated forms, are often edged, and incorporate in their composition richly elaborated zoomorphic motifs; on wood or bone this decorative ornament acquires a severe geometric, spiral- band character. At times, especially in architecture, it achieves large scale dimensions. The wide bands in a majority of cases are in- tertwined. This ornament is most fully developed among the Nivkh and Ul'ch, and to a lesser degree among Nanai, Oroch, Orok and Ainu (in Levin and Potapov, 1961:374). This type of ornament, says Ivanov, may be found on clothes, dishes, utensils, bedding, weapons, boats, storehouses and elsewhere. In examples of this type, however, Nivkh ele- ments are clearly distinguishable from those of the Nanai. The spirals are stronger and more defined.</page><page sequence="43">Black: The Nivkh 43 Representations of reptiles (turtles, toads, lizards, snakes) and fish predominate; they are more styl- ized and bolder than the floral or anthropomorphic representations of the Tungus/Manchu. Bird and deer representations differ in character from those frequently occurring among the motifs of their neighbors. Ivanov, too, failed both to examine Nivkh art in itself as a whole, and to interpret the possible symbolic significance of its forms. I am convinced that such significance exists. One has only to examine the magnificent illustrations in Shrenk or, for that matter, some of Laufer's own illustrations, particularly those of Nivkh spears. Even in perus- ing the drawings of mortuary houses in Shternberg (1929:136-138), one gains an idea of the originality of Nivkh artists and concludes that a convincing analysis of Nivkh art is yet to be written. Music.21 There is, to my knowledge, no pro- fessional analysis of Nivkh music. They had few musical instruments. A hollow log of dried larch suspended on ropes or on short uprights, which the women beat rhythmically with sticks, was used in the bear ritual (Shrenk, 1903:111:51, 73, 74; Hawes, 1904:197-198). Sometimes a singer would accom- pany his performance on a one- stringed violin- like instrument (Pilsudski, 1900:479). This instrument, called t'ynr, was made of birch bark and fish skin. The bow was strung with hair. Shrenk, who first described the log and the one- stringed violin, also described an instrument called kan'g made of cop- per, wood or iron, a sort of Jew's harp, which pro- duced a vibrating tone (Shrenk, 1903:111:51-52; Taksami, 1967:256, 258). The most popular musical form, however, was the song. Shrenk reproduces from unpublished notes by Middendorf some examples of the melodies and describes the manner of their delivery (1903: 111:48-51). Pilsudski (1913) described the lyrics, content and form of these songs. Folklore22 Nivkh folklore, very rich and varied in form and content, also awaits a special study. Archival sources in the Soviet Union are rich in folklore material, but little has been ana- lyzed and published to date. Pilsudski's publica- tions after his return from exile (1913) and his work Gilyak Poetry published in the magazine Lud in Lwow in 1911 and two publications by Shternberg (1900, 1908) with a few myths or tales scattered here and there, exhaust the list. Shternberg planned a monumental work of which only the first volume was published (1908) and this is for all practical purposes unavailable to readers in the United States.* The archival sources of the Soviet Union, *An incomplete, apparently damaged, copy is so rich in content, remain out of reach for most re- searchers. The discussion presented in this paper proceeds, then, from a severely limited base: Shternberg (1908), Pilsudski (as cited) and materials contained in a book by Sangi** (1961). From inter- nal evidence, Sangi's material underwent heavy editing to accommodate Russian language literary form. It was intended as a work of literature, not as anthropological evidence. The Nivkh distinguish many categories of their folklore. These have been recorded by Shternberg and he listed a minimum of twelve (1900:387-388; 1908:XIII-XDC). Of these the most important ernie categories were tylgund, epic tales transmitted from generation to generation and which may be styled as myths, that reflect world view and re- ligious beliefs. Tylgund were transmitted in a standardized form (Shternberg, 1908:XVÍ), and to alter a tylgund in its telling was a sin (Pilsudski, 1913:478; Shternberg, 1908:XIV). The story of lost literacy, recorded by Laufer (1900), several variants of the deluge and the multiple sun myths belong here. Nastund are mythological tales, which describe the adventures of a hero who overcomes obstacles and finally achieves success. Examples of such tales include the one published by Shternberg in 1900; the tale of a poor man besting his unfeeling maternal uncles who evade their obligation to ren- der a helping hand (Panfilov, 1965:11:247-255) and stories told by Vladimir Sangi (1961) Tale of an Orphan, The Story of Two Brothers, Tale of Young Hunter and others. Characteristic of this type of tale is the hero's namelessness and isola- tion (Shternberg, 1908:XIV). Nastund are improvisa- tions on the general model of tylgund. Keraind is a class of tales devoted to the per- petuation of historical records, purportedly dealing with actual events of long ago. The subject matter is that of war and blood feud and the tales are char- acterized by the absence of a hero. The actors are inhabitants of a locality. These tales are taught by fathers to sons and by the old men to the young (Shternberg, 1908:XIII). Proverbs, puzzles and puns formed a genre of their own, but these are not represented in the available literature. Most popular, however, were the songs. Pilsudski, who recorded an enormous collection of Nivkh songs, most of them never pub- lished, wrote that these lyrics - alaktund - encom- passed a wide range, containing "tragedy, pathos, melancholy humor, and occasionally, exaggerated satire" (1913:478). In modern times Robert Auster- litz recorded and analyzed a small number of songs in the New York Public Library. In England, the British Museum possesses a copy. **See bibliography.</page><page sequence="44">44 Arctic Anthropology X-l fi S- c c^ I- I ^H to a, a e ^c ^ d is.

The Nivkh prided themselves on their ability to compose songs; women were considered especially adept at it, some becoming widely known as poets. Love songs were popular. "All Gilyak, it is said, know the old songs the epics of their race but with the lyrics it is other- wise, for they are very numerous and always being added to" (Hawes, 1904:265). Songs of unrequited love and suicide songs formed a category of their own. Hawes reported: . . . the old old songs of this people tell mostly of such events - of the death of the disappointed lovers, or of the impassioned appeal to the loved one. . . . The usual motif of these lyrics is betrothal of the girl when young and her subsequent violent and secret attachment to another and youthful lover. If the mutual passion is strong, then rather than become the wife of one chosen by her parents, she and her lover will commit sui- cide . . . since those who thus kill themselves in the same way will be together in heaven. There is one song well known among the Gilyak, which tells how a young man loved a fair maiden already betrothed in her child- hood to another, and how they agreed to commit suicide. This man, however, proved faithless and not only did not fullfil his word, but had never intended to do so. Until this day, it is said, the maiden's spirit has never ceased to upbraid him, calling always "Ah, you said you would kill yourself, and you have not. You deceived me, men are liars" (Hawes, 1904:264-265). Here is Pilsudski's testimony: Love songs form the bulk of the lyrics. These alakhtund do not evidence any in- fluence from the folklore of neighboring tribes as is the case with the other poetical works of the Gilyaks, but reflect the indi- vidual characteristics of the tribe. It is only among the Gilyak that love between two persons is so intense that they prefer death to separation. The lot of the woman in the Gilyak family is very hard. In child- hood she is sold to a strange family, and is not allowed to remain among her own people nor to marry a man of her father's clan. From these circumstances often result tragedies; the woman, usually still a young girl, feels a repulsion from the unknown house and family of the husband for whom she is destined by her parents, sometimes from the day of her birth. Some of these songs have been the precursors of suicide. A frequent theme of Gilyak lyrics is the history of two lovers who cannot marry be- cause the girl is already promised to another man. They decide to die together, for ac- cording to Gilyak belief, such a simultane- ous death will bind them together forever in the other world. Sometimes it happens that the girl falls in love with a man of her own clan. If her relatives find out, they avenge this awful crime by compelling the girl to commit suicide" (1900:479-480).* When two lovers decided to die together each composed a farewell song. Sometimes one, usually the man, failed in the attempt, as the rope broke under his weight. In such a case, he may divulge the farewell songs composed before the attempt. Pilsudski described a song of this type sung by an old woman as "dirge like" (1900:490). In general, Nivkh songs are sung in a low voice, modulated in the throat and chest. Shrenk described evenings in Nivkh dwellings when people gathered around the central hearth, with a singer or a story-teller enter- taining all until late at night. He claims that the Nivkh seldom sang in daytime, but at night songs were a favorite form of expression. Occasionally, when all were asleep, an individual would start to sing a sad monotonous song. He was not interrupted and all listened respectfully until he finished (Shrenk, 1881-1895:111; 1899:11:48-51). Shamans, who could become such only through inspiration, were frequently also poets and bards as singing and the ability to compose songs was con- sidered a gift (Pilsudski, 1900:482-484). The singer almost always explained the circumstances under- lying the creation of the song and whom the song concerned, making clear before whom the particular song must not be repeated (Pilsudski, 1900:479). The richness and variety of Nivkh folklore can barely be indicated in this short sketch. The bulk of collected materials, large in quantity, with exegetical notes and contextual data, await a scholarly analysis. I should like to conclude this section by the completion of Shternberg's listing of the Nivkh folklore categories. The historical epos, the myths, and the inspirational heroic im- provisations and the lyrics have been discussed. The Nivkh recognized as a separate category ikhnyngyund, a large class of minor epics dealing mainly with animals. This class also embraced proverbs, jokes and puns (Shternberg, 1908:XVIII); puzzles; utkhavrnd; ritual and judicial formulas. *Pilsudski, in spite of long residence in their proximity, failed to understand the Nivkh social system.</page><page sequence="46">46 Arctic Anthropology X-l Fig. 22.

V. WORLD VIEW33 The Nivkh concept of the universe is, essen- tially, a unitary one. Called kurn, the universe encompasses the concept of a High God, a Creator, and a Far and Distant God. The real universe, the universe of senses, is only the form of the divine essence (Shternberg, 1904:11:19). Kurn is all en- compassing, manifest in everything. At the same time, each part of the universe is itself a whole, but simultaneously it is indivisible from the uni- verse, kurn, everything forming a single living entity. The ebb and tide are described as the "breath of the Universe" (Kreinovich, 1929:78). The Nivkh believe that other universes exist, somewhere outside their own. Stars may be such universes (Shrenk, 1903:111:47). The universes beyond the horizon are inaccessible to all who are part of this universe, except for the swans. Able to pass from one universe to the other, these beau- tiful and magic birds once were black like the raven, which was then white, before the two birds changed color* (Kreinovich, 1929:97). When the swans fly away in autumn, they travel to that dis- tant place where sky and earth meet; as the sky, breathing, lifts its edge above that of the earth, the swans fly through into another world. Not all succeed, for the sky breathes out, descending again and crushing those birds which are too slow. The Old Woman sits at the edge of the world keep- ing watch.** When the great birds die under the weight of the sky, she gathers their bodies and eats them (Kreinovich, 1929:79). In this myth, the concept of the universe as a breathing, living entity is clearly demonstrated. The universe is never static, it is in constant motion; motion is life, which manifests itself in all: the earth, too, breathes and moves. Sakhalin, in reality, is a live being, a beast which periodically rises and then lies down again. When the beast moves, people feel the earth tremble in the earthquakes. But each part of Sakhalin, of the earth - myf - (The Nivkh designate Sakhalin specifically by this term, al- though myf also can mean "earth" or "homeland") in itself is a living being, whether a cape, a rock, all lives, and all can move (Kreinovich, 1929:78, 90; Shternberg, 1904b:II:19-20). Each living entity is described by the Nivkh in anthropomorphic terms. Thus myf must have a body and this body must have parts, a head, feet, arms. The "head" of Sakhalin is Cape Maria and its feet are two small peninsulas in the south, on the LaPerouse Strait (Shternberg, 1904b:II:19-20). The Universe is divided along the vertical axis into three worlds: the world of the above , of the sky, the tly vo, literally "the sky village"; the middle world, which is the earth, and the world of the below, the underground, mly vo, the world of the dead in the normal course of events (Kreinovich, 1929:81). The Middle World or the earthly part of the uni- verse inhabited by human beings becomes in itself a universe, "our" universe, while the Upper and the Lower Worlds represent the universe of the "other." The living belong to "our" universe, the dead are part of the "other," which is dual. The earthly world, the universe of here and now, how- ever, is not viewed as a single entity: it is in itself tripartite, viewed along the horizontal axis. The Nivkh distinguish the human settlement, the world of the mountain/forest and the world of the waters. The dichotomy of wilderness and tamed land is explicit. The tamed domesticated land is specifically the domain of living people; the wilder- ness is inhabited by diverse living creatures and at the same time is the province of the benevolent dead. The relationship between human beings and the elements with all the creatures peculiar to each is conceived as a process of unending reciprocity and exchange. Life and its sustenance are a gift of those beings who, each in his own element, en- sure its order and functioning: thus the Master of the Waterst sends human beings fish and sea ani- mals so that man can have food and clothing; the Master of the Mountain/Forest supplies animals and fruits of his domain. Such bountiful giving ^Indications are that white in the Nivkh con- cept may be associated with water, power, death; black with good fortune. Funeral body garments are white; black is the color of festive garments. **The significance of this figure, as is that of her counterpart at the edge of the world below, is not clear. ti understand that the Nivkh term is yz, "big man," "master" and in Russian literature it is customarily translated as khoziain - the word meaning master as well as husband in an archaic sense as in "to carefully husband one's estate." For lack of a better term, the word "Master" is used here.</page><page sequence="48">48 Arctic Anthropology X-l obliges the human race to return gifts too, thus en- suring the continuation of the process. A principle of exchange of unlike items governs the gift giving to trans cendentals as to other humans. The Master of the Waters, in return for his fish and sea ani- male, may not receive anything associated with the sea, but rather is given fruits of the earth. The Master of the Mountain/Forest may not be given the flesh of animals he has sent to the Nivkh, but rather be offered items foreign to the forest. Gift giving, or ritual offerings, is referred to as "feed- ing" or "nourishing."* While the Middle World and its subdivision are clearly articulated in Nivkh ideology, the same may not be said about the Upper and the Lower Worlds. The Upper World, the World of the Sky and the Heavens , is probably the least clearly defined one (Kreinovich, 1929:100). As all worlds have their masters, so the Upper World is governed or rather expressed in the figure of the Heavenly Man, the Master of the Heavens. Men who die a violent death, through murder or in war, enter his domain for a time. Still less sharply drawn is the figure of the Master of the Earth (Shternberg, 1904b:27-28).** The sun, the moon and other heavenly bodies are at the same time part of the upper world as well as separate distant universes. The sun and the moon are a conjugal pair, the sun female, the moon male (Shternberg, 1893:20). They travel and move around the earth (Shrenk, 1903:111:47; Kreinovich, 1929:81). Shternberg was told that each universe had its own Master. "Did not you see the Lunar Man, when the moon was big? He looks a veritable Nivkh," Shternberg quotes his informant (1893:20). At night the sun shines in the Lower World, giving light to the villages of the dead (Shternberg 1933: 320). Shternberg noted that the annual "Feeding" of the Master of the Waters from which women are barred completely, takes place at night at the rise of the new moon. There seems to be an association between hum as creator of the universe and the deity of the waters. Shternberg ascribed to him the first creation of the main geographic features of this world while Kreinovich associates this creation with T a jruhand or Taikhangd , whom he identifies with the Master of the Waters; in both cases the deity engages in the creative enterprise astride a white deer; in both cases, it is stated that this figure is considered to embody the most powerful forces (Shternberg, 1893:20; 1904b:II:20; 1933:320; Kreinovich, 1929:89). The Master of the Sea is also associated with the sky, reflected in the name of the Milky Way tairhand zif, "the trail of the Sea deity" (Kreinovich, 1292:81, 91). The name, also glossed by Kreinovich as "unknown being" (1929: 91-92), and given as taikhund as the designation of the Creator, is associated with the Master of the Waters by Sangi (1961) and once again fcy Shternberg (1933:321, 332). The data seem to indicate that whereas in the Nivkh world view the Heavens, the Earth, the Mountain/Forest and the Sea are differen- tiated, each element being recognized in separate ritual, that at a deeper level, the unitary principle prevails. Shternberg argued very persuasively that the essence of the Nivkh world view was the recog- nition that the visible experienced phenomena in all their diversity represented only the variety of form which hid the underlying unity of being (Shtern- berg, 1904b:II:21-22). The information about the Master of the Earth is scant and scattered through many sources. As the whole is manifest in its parts, a certain feature of the landscape, such as a mountain or a rock may be conceived as a particular manifestation of the Master himself. The only account specifically per- taining to this concept that I was able to find was f Shternberg 's and I reproduce it here in full: It was in August 1891. With great diffi- culties, almost totally out of provisions and food, with only one brick of tea and some dried bread in my possession, I reached the Head of the Earth, t When I informed my companions that I had decided to climb the summit of the Head to collect plants and obtain rock samples, they panicked. They begged me to desist from my "insane" in- tention, which must bring, if put into execu- tion, our collective destruction. As proof they cited the case of two Russian sailors who climbejd the summit of Cape Lazarev, a deity of lesser importance, who died in the attempt and were buried there. Particularly upset was the captain of my boat, intelli- gent, loyal and sincerely attached to me, a Gilyak from the village Tangi, Gibel'ka by name. As in "nourish the soul." In Russian anthro- pological literature the word kormlenie is used, which may be roughly glossed as "feeding," but in Russian the word has a broader connotation than its English equivalent. **It is not clear if Master of the Earth and Masters of different particular geographic features are identical. The ambiguity may be only the short- coming of existing ethnographies, since in Shtern- berg1 s and Kreinovich 's time little attention was paid to questions of world view and religious be- liefs, and it is doubtful if it would be possible to do so now. Old traditions are dying. tCape Maria, Sakhalin.</page><page sequence="49">Black: The Nivkh 4g "What is there to fear for you?" I told him, "you shall remain here, stay alive, re- turn home, all will be well. Do not worry about me." "Oh, no, friend," he contradicted energetically, "that is bad law. Together we came, together we worked, together we wrote , together we looked for stone axes , to- gether we examined people, together gave justice, and now I should go home alone and you shall die? Is that the law? And what will the biggest Master of All say? He will say, why didn't you see to it that your com- panion* did well? He will say that I killed you and that will be a great sin. No, better leave the God of the Earth alone. He is very big, very strong, his wrath can be great." I was not to be persuaded, and Gibel'ka after some thought said: "And you have nothing to offer the Head of the Earth, such a great Vangi - and no offering. You know, if one were to offer a gift and say a good word, the Master maybe will not become angry. " I had some hard candy in my pocket, which I used to quench thirst when moun- tain climbing. I showed these to my com- panions and told them that I would offer the candy to the angry god and would say a good word. They were calmed somewhat and I set out on my way. When I returned in the evening, loaded with my collection of plants and minerals, my companions surrounded me in great joy and demanded an account of my words to the God of the Head of the Earth. I was constrained to read them a prayer in their own style: "Lord of the Earth, you are very great and very powerful, and you are quick to anger. All people know thee. I came from a distant land, from the farthest land, to look at you. Please keep my com- panions and myself well, let us return home, see to it that on the way we shall not starve to death. Please, feed me well." When in the evening of the same day we reached the village Puir, tired and hungry, Gibel'ka re- ported to the astounded listeners in the hut where we stayed how well I made the offer- ing and prayed to the Lord. The reaction was incredible. All faces expressed the greatest piety and women ran to the store- houses for precious cereal grain used in sacrificial offerings, to give to me and my companions and thus comply with the will of the Head of the Earth (1904b:27-28). It would seem on the basis of Shternberg's ac- count that the Master of the Earth is important in the Nivkh world view and that his presence is all pervasive. Other scattered data seem to indicate that individual spontaneous offerings which accom- pany every action of the Nivkh may be directed to this deity, or possibly to the kurn, the unknown, universal creator-god in his manifestation in the things of this earth. The interrelationships of human beings with nature, animate and inanimate, creates a complex web in which the multiplicity of forms are conceived as multiple manifestations of a single unity. Thus at one time an animal may be either an animal, a manifestation of a spirit, possibly even an ancestor or a living person who for some mysterious reason has changed his appearance, or a manifestation of the Master of the particular element. For example, the bear is simultaneously a manifestation of the Master of the Mountain/Forest, of ancestors who have, by the manner of their death or their standing in life conceivably entered the lineage of the Master and are the benefactors, protectors and intermedi- aries between living lineage members and the transcendental, and he may possibly also be a mani- festation of a person. The killer whale, apparently, occupies an analogous position with respect to the Master of the Waters. The animals of the forest or the sea, sent to the Nivkh for the sake of their well being by the Mas- ters of the two elements, are, however, not mere objects or tools. As part of the universe themselves, the animals must play their role so that the universe can be perpetuated. As animals themselves consent to be killed, they themselves participate in the process of giving and therefore the Nivkh must also give gifts in return: both respect and food for the animals' souls as they journey to the other world where life continues , perhaps eventually to be re- created here and now in the Middle World. It is for this purpose that the bones of slain animals must be returned to the element whence they came. Slain animals, especially seals, dolphins and white whales, are "fed" with grasses brought from home by fishermen especially for this purpose; the bear killed in the bear feast or in the hunt is "fed" at home with the choicest dishes. Respect is shown to slain animals in many forms: dolphin heads are preserved at the sea's edge on poles; the bones of sea mammals, including smashed skulls, eyes, etc., are reverently returned to the sea as materials for future regeneration and recreation of the species.** In the original, Vangi - glossed as a term of respect. **As stated elsewhere, in the Nivkh idiom bones connote the essence of bodily existence, the identity and unity of a lineage, the male procreative element.</page><page sequence="50">50 Arctic Anthropology X-l Vegetation, too, forms an inseparable part of the living universe. When a Nivkh cuts down a tree, on the stump he reverently places inau - a small wooden stick cut into strips of shavings at least at one end. Inau is believed to preserve the soul of a thing, animal or person. It is a symbol of lifegiving* (Shternberg, 1904b:20). The Nivkh world view makes it imperative for each member of the society to participate in the ritual life as an individual and as a member of the group. Thus , Nivkh rituals , briefly touched upon in this chapter, may be classified as "private" - ritual acts performed by individuals on situational basis - and "public" - ritual acts performed by a group qua group at stated predetermined times and places of worship. These latter rituals are lineage rituals and, as are the private ones, are concerned with the maintenance of relationships between the world of the human beings and the worlds of the tran- scendentals, and are expressive of the tripartite division of the world along the horizontal and ver- tical axis and will be discussed in a separate section. Here I shall only mention that while the bear and killer whale mediate along the horizontal plane of the Middle World between the domesticated sphere and the wilderness, between the living and the benevolent dead, the mediators between the living and inimical dead and the dangerous forces of the universe are, along the vertical axis, birds and trees (Kreiriovich, 1930a:108). It is known that the Nivkh associate souls in some aspects with birds, and the latter with the sky. A bird, possibly a lark, represents thunder and lightning (Shternberg, 1933:314; Kreinovich, 1929:94). The native term for this bird is Vynd. The fire issues from its mouth and the thunder is caused by the sweep of its wings. This bird is small and descends from heaven with its own egg or a fledgeling and puts it into the nest of another small bird tet , who stands in the relationship of akhmalk - the wife giver - to Vynd (Kreinovich, 1929:94). In winter, the thunder bird is beneath the ice in the domain of the water. It is inimical to the inhabitants, especially the supernatural in- habitants of the domain of the Mountain/Forest and is considered dangerous by and to the Nivkh (Kreinovich, 1929:94-95; Shternberg, 1933:314, 320). Raven or crow on land may be a symbol of good luck and ugn** a water bird, on the water. On the other hand, birds are associated with death. Hawes stated that wings of white-tailed eagles (Haeliatus albicillu§ were placed on the grave of murder victims or suicides (1904:176). • A Bird of Violence, takhch, appears and neither knows any rest nor gives any to the people when a member of the kin group has been slain and re- mains unavenged. Some believe that souls of those dead by violence are represented in those birds. In the Nivkh mortuary symbolism, a cuckoo and a dove are symbols of the departed soul, one repre- senting the female, the other the male, depending on the sex of the deceased. It is believed that these birds waken the souls after the funeral and accompany the dead on their journey to the under- world. Thus on the grave site, next to the carved image of a cuckoo, relatives must place a wooden dish containing water. The bird must tire on the journey, and the water will replenish its strength. Eagle feathers must be used to sweep the ashes of the funeral pyre, easing the soul's passage. If a woman in her dreams reaches out for the soul of a child she would have and takes a bird instead of an egg or a pebble, her future child will die, for his soul, a bird, will try to reach the sky world. If children play with birds, the creatures cannot be released for fear they will carry away the children's souls (Shternberg, 1933:331; Kreinovich, 1930b:89). Sangi tells a lovely legend of a girl who es- capes life with a cruel stepmother. When playing on the shore, she is surrounded by swans, is trans- formed into one and taken into the flock, while her grieving father turns into a gnarled old larch tree (1961). The tree as mediator between the world above and the world below is explicitly used in the lineage ritual of the offering to the Master of the Sky or Heavens. The offering is made at the base of a larch tree. The same tree is used for private offerings at hunting sites, also to the Master of the Heavens. The lineage offering to the Master of the Heavens occurs twice a year, in summer and in winter. A red dog, associated with the first dogs created and also a sacrifice at any new settlement site to the Master of the Earth, is killed. The tree is decorated with two carved figures, one male, one female, placed on a board. Inau made of mountain ash are placed at a tree and a thread is tied to the tree. "The tree is a road: all offer tly-nivukht and the offering travels along the tree and then along the thread which serves as a trail" (Shternberg, 1933: 312). On the grave of a murder victim, an uprooted tree stump must be placed to make it possible for the soul to reach mly-vo from the sky where it rest- lessly flies as a bird. This is my reading of Shternberg 's interpreta- tion of the Nivkh concept regarding nature. ^The Arctic (Pacific) Loon or Black- throated Diver. 1*His statement is not supported by other data. XTly-nivukh means "Man of the Sky," often used as a synonym for the Master of the Sky (Heavens).</page><page sequence="51">Black: The Nivkh 51 Trees are used as symbols of the well-being of a child. Young fir trees are placed, roots in- tact, over the grave site of a young child. Mourn- ing and care of the grave site are spoken of as "taking care of the tree" (Shternberg, 1933:307). There are several variants of the origin myth which trace the descent of the human race to trees, as well as legends of all living creatures, and of tools which enabled human beings to survive, fall- ing from heaven or from birds (Kreinovich, 1929:82, 97, 100). The Nivkh are often considered to be descendents of the larch tree, the Orok from the birch and the Ainu from the fir (Kreinovich, 1929: 100). Sometimes the myths tell that these people were created from the sap of these respective trees. With the ash tree is associated the most feared supernatural, the Ash-child. It is believed that this small, naked child, born of the sap of the ash, cannot be distinguished from a human child, ex- cept perhaps that half of its finger and toe nails may be black. This child wanders in the woods and cries. Its cry, once heard, causes madness. The ash tree is seen as a woman (Kreinovich, 1929: 93). Though the evidence cited above on the signifi- cance of bird and tree symbolism is somewhat in- consistent and perhaps confusing, the inference that the world of the above and the world of the below are somehow intertwined through the agency of the tree seems inescapable. I believe that it is significant that a female image is associated with both the heavenly world and the world beneath, even though the Masters of these worlds without question are seen as male. However, at the border of each world, at the edge where the sky and the earth meet and in the passage that the dead must travel, an old woman sits as guardian of the portal. Shadowy, somewhat frighten- ing, her appearance bodes no good. It is she who drags away the bodies of the swans crushed by the sky. Her counterpart stands guard below the earth, inspecting each soul that passes for pierced ears. Woe to the soul of the Nivkh who neglected to provide himself with such holes. The Old Woman will pounce, just as the Old Woman dwelling at the edge of the sky pounces on the dead swans, and the soul will perish, never to reach mly vo. The woman who dwells at the edge of the sky is also the source of the winds, and winds bring bad luck. The Nivkh recognize six winds: North- west, Northeast, East, Southwest, Southeast, and West. Each wind blows through a separate opening in the sky-earth edge. When the Old Woman sits at home and sews, calm prevails; but when she ventures abroad and swings her skirts around, winds blow. When she urinates, rainstorms come (Kreino- vich, 1929:80). Shrenk reports that when the North and Northwest winds blow, bringing with them foul weather, sacrifices are made to appease them. Choice black puppies were sacrificed and, when the storm did not stop the next day, the sacrifice was repeated (Shrenk, 1899:11:123-124). Winds also may be killed (Shternberg, 1933:320; Shrenk, 1899:11:123-124; Kreinovich, 1929:80). A brave man may venture to kill the evil wind with a special arrow, two-pronged and with burning tinder inserted between the prongs, discharged directly into the center of the whirl. If the man is successful, a blood spot will appear on the ground. There is a wind deity, layzn and a bad wind, lamangd , of ill intent and no offerings are made to them (Shtern- berg, 1933:320). The Nivkh have well defined concepts of time, measurement and spatial distance. They recognize major constellations, planets and stars and have specific names for them (Shrenk, 1903:111:47; Kreinovich, 1929:81). The year is basically divided into two seasons, and into lunar months. Laufer erroneously reported that the Nivkh year was only six months in European terms (1900). Shrenk thought that the Nivkh year was roughly divided into twelve months, but Kreinovich reports thirteen (Shrenk, 1899: 11:214-215; Kreinovich, 1934b:182). The months are named for seasonal activities and fish or animals associated with the economic life of the group at any given time. The thirteenth month reported by Kreinovich is called "moon month." While the year is roughly divided into winter (approximately Octo- ber through April) and summer (approximately May through September), fall and spring seasons have names as well (Shrenk, 1899:214). The daily passage of time is described in terms of reference to the position of the sun: the sun is born (rises) and it dies (sets). Different time spans of the day, such as morning, noon, evening, have specific designations. VI, THE SOUL34 It is believed that the child's soul is sent to enter the mother's womb either by the Master of the Mountain/Forest or by the Master of the Waters, even though the physical cause of pregnancy is well known and recognized. It is also believed that be- fore becoming pregnant, the woman incites the soul to enter her dreams. As her own soul wanders in dreams, she may reach for an object, and if it is associated with the world of the water, the Master of that element will send the child's soul; if it is an object that has an association with the forest, the Master of the Mountain/Forest will send the child's soul. Sometimes, the woman's soul will find her children in a nest, in the form of a bird's egg. Here a mistake could be costly: if she should reach for a little bird, her child will not live</page><page sequence="52">52 Arctic Anthropology X-l (Kreinovich, 1930a: 89). Such cases are not fre- quent, however, and most children's souls are sent by the Masters of the two main elements, as should properly be the case. A child who dies be- fore the age of five or six may be reincarnated in its mother's next child. When a young child dies, the father erects a small hut on the place of crema- tion where the child's toys are lovingly placed. The cremation place is selected so that it will be somewhere near a path that the mother frequents each day. She will go there day after day and call for the child to return. The soul may listen and come back, then the woman will soon become preg- nant. Should the mother's call go unanswered, then the soul has flown away, possibly in the shape of a bird. Sometimes the soul of a deceased relative may be reincarnated in a newborn child, but such cases are rare exceptions (Kreinovich, 1930a: 100- 101; Shternberg, 1933:332). The soul, cheg'n or chekhn, sometimes referred to as yrykh, is the core of being, like the core of the tree. In its essence, the soul is in man's blood, and when a man dies, his soul flies away and his blood is gone. Presumably connected with the association of the blood and soul is the notion of blood pollution, though perhaps "danger" in this case would have been a more appropriate term. Women's blood is held to be especially dangerous for their male agnates and this belief is reflected in customs associated with birth and menstruation. While the soul is spoken of as the essence of being, it is not conceptualized as a single entity. In the classic Nivkh pattern the soul is composed of two components, one of which is double. The small double soul, the shadows, act as helpmates and reportedly inhabit or have the shape of a small egg or eggs, located in the head of the main soul. After the death of the main soul, the small soul as- sumes its functions or becomes a duplicate of the original main soul (Shternberg, 1904b:52; 1933:331). These small souls enter the pry ski, the dog double of the man, at his death. The small soul(s) acts mainly when the person is asleep, manifesting it- self in his dreams. If an event that a person has dreamed does come to pass, then the action was that of his main soul. Should the dreams not ma- terialize, these were only the activities of the shadow souls (Shternberg, 1933:306). The souls of the dead may be stolen either by the evil spirits or by machinations of shamans, so that relatives of the deceased must stand armed guard to frighten away possible thieves (Kreinovich, 1930a:103). Some souls are more vulnerable than others, those whose death was by drowning being in special danger (Shternberg, 1933:309). In the ordinary course of events the evil spirits who have caused death are satisfied with the death alone, and the soul may proceed unhindered to the mly vo, the village of the dead (Shternberg, 1904b: 53). Mly-vo t the abode of the majority of souls, is a duplicate of the Nivkh world of the Middle Earth, the only difference being that those who were poor now will be rich, and vice versa. The soul will lead in the afterworld the same life as its owner led on earth: hunt, fish, marry (Kreinovich, 1929: 102; 1930a:112; Shternberg, 1904b:II:53). The Nivkh believe that if a widower or a widow remarries, the dead partner does the same in the afterworld; if the living partner remains unmarried, the dead one waits and the two will be reunited (Kreinovich, 1930a: 112). Mly-vo is reached through a dark hole in the ground which is some- where not very far away. The entrance is narrow, and one must crawl through on all fours until one reaches the village. Here, on the banks of a river that is always filled with choice fish, summer is eternal, and yukola in plentiful supply. The dead souls who inhabit mly vo are bodyless, and one may pass through them as if through emptiness (Zolotarev, 1933:65). Kreinovich was told that the passage which Zolotarev 's informants described as narrow was roomy and one could pass through it without bending, but his informants stressed the danger of the Old Woman who inspects the souls' ears (Kreinovich, 1930a:112; Shternberg, 1933:330). There are obstacles, though, along this passage to the world of the dead and the soul needs help. First, as mentioned above, there is the old woman who takes away the souls of people with unpierced ears. Second, the way is tortuous and long, with a river to be crossed at the very end. To reach mly- vo the soul must have the guidance of the soul of the dog(s) slain during the funeral, the cuckoo bird, a thread or hair as a guide line or, as Shternberg reports, rather the "insert sole of the footgear" (1933:307), and the wooden figurine to make a bridge across the river. The soul is not immortal. Every soul survives either for three generations (or reincarnations), if it belongs to a man, or four if it belongs to a woman, each time passing on to the next mly-vo. The soul is born in each separate world: once on this earth, twice in the underworld if a man and three times if a woman, but each re- birth takes place in a different shape, forever getting smaller until it turns into dust (Shternberg, 1904b:II:53). The souls of men and women may finally become two different kinds of grasses or turn into a bird cherry bush or perhaps into a cuckoo bird (Kreinovich, 1930a:102, 103); or, according to Zolotarev, the souls of the poor become grass and the souls of the rich become dogs (1933:65). Both Kreinovich and Zolotarev stated that they had ex- treme difficulty in eliciting material on the trans- migration of souls, and Kreinovich went so far as to suggest that this was esoteric knowledge, per- haps not open to everyone. In any case, the Nivkh</page><page sequence="53">Black: The Nivkh 53 theory of soul transmigration and rebirth was not common knowledge (Kreinovich, 1930a: 103). When it is believed that the soul of a de- ceased relative has been reincarnated in a child, it is imperative that the father perform the ritual of memory removal, because should the child remember his previous existence he will die (Shternberg, 1933: 332).* There is some indication that the Nivkh believe that the small soul brings individual luck and that it resides on the crown of the head, on the very top. Presumably, this belief is the basis of the custom which prohibits cutting of hair for adults. Children's hair is cut, but a tuft is always left on top of the crown, a sort of "scalp lock." If by some misadventure the "scalp lock" is damaged or cut, the child will die. I have used the term "scalp lock" deliberately, as is clarified by Kreinovich 's account: In the village of Chaivo I recorded a legend from the history of the wars of the Chaivo Gilyak with those of Sakhalin's western coast. In this legend is told the story of how the Chaivo Gilyak exterminated the Gilyaks of the West Coast whom they ambushed in the forest. One of the enemy they left alive. They cut the hair from his crown together with a piece of skin (kys'ouf,) and part of his clothing next to his heart (nifrara) and let him go. He reached his village and just managed to tell what hap- pened when he fell dead; his soul, together with his hair, had been taken by the enemy. This is how the Gilyak explained his death to me (1930a:102). The fate of the soul after death is determined by the manner of death. Not all souls reach mly vo immediately. Souls who set out on the journey to mly vo when the living have completed the funeral and leave-taking rites are those persons who died of old age or illness, or, in the Nivkh ideology, through the work of evil spirits. Suicides suffer uncertain fate: some also go directly to mly vo where they live as outcasts, wandering outside the village where others live with their agnatic kins- men, eating frogs and lizards. Others may wander in the wilderness of the middle earth, also feeding on reptiles and amphibians.** Those who die in epidemics, such as smallpox, which are believed to be caused by the blood spilled in the foreigners1 warst are not given burial by cremation until long after the epidemic has subsided, but still go to mly vo (Shternberg, 1933:331). Those who die in a war, victims of murder, or those who die of wounds (knife, arrow or gunshot) become birds and dwell in the sky - tly vo. These birds are black with red beaks (Shternberg, 1933: 331 )t and are the size of a raven. When a murder has been committed they come in flocks and cry for vengeance, filling the hearts of the avengers with courage. As soon as blood vengeance is exacted, the souls of victim and murderer go to mly vo together. If tkhusind, the blood fine, has been paid and duly accepted, the soul of the victim also finds rest and sets out on its journey to mly vo. Unavenged dead become angry ancestors who may bring misfortune on the lineage. Those who die when hunting a bear, are killed by a bear or, in the case of women, have been divined to have been chosen by the bear (in his manifestation as Master of the Mountain/Forest) to be his bride, enter the domain of the Master of the Mountain/Forest, become "bear people," mem- bers of his lineage, and live there until old age. Accordingly, their bodies undergo different burial rites than normal mortals. Those who die by drowning enter the domain of the Master of the Waters to become his lineage members. Twins, as well as their mothers, may become members of either supernatural lineage, depending on whether the twin birth was occasioned by one or the other of these elements. All these souls become benev- olent ancestors who aid the Masters of the Elements in their efforts to provide the living kinsmen with sustenance, protect them from misfortune, and may be appealed to for aid in cases of illness; in gen- eral they act as intercessors with superior powers. They are the foremost guardians of the living, and the living are under obligation to remember them with ceremonies which symbolize the unity of the lineage - the living, dead, and yet unborn. The bear festival is such a rite, as in all probability are the rites associated with the killer whale. The unity of all living and dead must be constantly reinforced and maintained, as must the unity be- tween men and other beings, especially the ultimate source of all creation, and this is done, as mentioned, by rituals of the sky and earth, forest and sea. *The ritual of memory removal is also per- formed for twins and will be discussed in the sec- tion specifically devoted to that topic. **The Nivkh do not use these animals for food. To them, especially toward snakes and toads, Gilyak evidence supers ititious fear (Shrenk, 1899: 11:128). * It will be remembered that blood in essence is soul; the unavenged foreign dead become malici- ous and cause death in turn. ÍShrenk described them as white (1903:111: 141), claiming that they were identical with ugn1, Colymbus arcticus, a species of loon.</page><page sequence="54">54 Arctic Anthropology X-l A special category of benevolent ancestral dead souls is formed by those who die by fire and lightning (Shternberg, 1904b:III:73). These appar- ently enter the lineage of the Master (Mistress) of the household fire. The significance of the hearth and fire has been touched upon in the chapter on settlement and dwelling, but the details given there do not exhaust the meaning of this element in the Nivkh conceptual schema. The fire and the hearth are said to be spiritual ancestors to the lineage. Shternberg thought that funeral by cremation was in a sense giving back the dead to the ancestors (1893:19; 104b:III:73). It is interesting that only good quality larch wood was used to build and feed the funeral pyre,* and that bodies of young children whose souls might choose to return were burned not on larch but on juniper or yew wood. VII. TWINS It has been mentioned in the previous section that twins and their mothers after death become protectors of the living and intercessors for the good health and fortune on behalf of the living be- fore the supernaturals. This concept is, of course, concomitant with the Nivkh conceptualization of twin birth. A twin birth is a supernatural event. Only one birth can result from natural copulation between a man and a woman. This belief is clearly reflected, for example, in the myth Why There Are So Few People on Earth, which states that after a tremen- dous natural catastrophe, when Sakhalin turned over completely, only three people, two brothers and a sister were saved, together with a few ani- mals. Later they all assembled in council with representatives of the Creator, taikhangd, a hare and a squirrel, to determine how to ensure further survival. Each animal was given the ability to bear as many children as his proposed mode of life would sustain. When it came the turn of the woman to speak on how she wished to ensure her succes- sion, she was so bashful and delayed her answer so long that it was decreed that human females forthwith would bear one, and only one, child at a time (Sangi, 1961:16-19). It follows, then, that when two children are born of one woman at the same time, the event is abnormal and a super- natural agency must be at work. Triplets are un- thinkable, and neither Pilsudski (1910) nor Shtern- berg (1929), who have given particular attention to the problem of multiple births , was able to record *It will be remembered that some origin myths trace the descent of the Nivkh as a race from the sap of a larch tree. a single instance. Pilsudski states that his in- formants insisted that twins can be only of a single sex. He was unable to record any case of twins of different sexes, and the only reference to such an occurrence was found in a very old song. In this song, the brother and sister were described as be- ing in love and the brother begging the sister "to take his heart in her hands," otherwise he would die (1910:760). It is possible to speculate whether twins of different sex were killed. Elsewhere it is indicated that incest in the womb was assumed. Among the Nivkh, incest was a mortal sin and in- cestuous unions ended in death for both partners, who were usually compelled to commit suicide, with any issue killed. Unfortunately, no ethnographer has given special attention to the question as to whether infanticide of twins of different sex oc- curred. The attitude of the Nivkh, according to the sources cited, was ambiguous. On the one hand, the twins and their mother were given special burial rites and their help was invoked, especially in case of illness. On the other hand, the spirit of the dead twin or twins was feared; this was espec- ially true when twins died in childhood. In this case relatives must observe certain rituals to make sure that the ill-disposed spirit does not trouble the lineage. Young women and girls were forbidden to listen to stories which recount the birth and death of twins, and women may not accept presents or borrow utensils from a woman who has borne twins. The paternity of twins was explained as follows: one was fathered by the woman's husband, and the other either by the spirit of the Master of the Moun- tain/Forest or that of the Master of the Waters. The twins' mother was regarded as a chosen one. The identity of the supernatural father was revealed by the nature of the mother's dreams, usually during her pregnancy. If she dreamed of bear- like or tiger- like creatures , or during waking hours reported having smelled these animals, the divine father was the Mountain/Forest. If her dreams were associated with the sea or river, the Water Spirit was her super- natural partner. Copulation with supernatural beings is believed to take place while the woman is asleep. As the supernatural desires to possess his child, the supernatural twin usually dies early. Since it is impossible to determine which of the twins is supernatural, both are often taken, and after death supernatural quality is transferred to the human twin also. If the twins survive, it is assumed that gradually the supernatural twin will loose all mem- ory of his other-worldly associations. The human qualities will then be transferred to him from his naturally born twin. To assist in this process, the human father performs the ritual of memory removal as soon as the children are old enough to talk</page><page sequence="55">Black: The Nivkh 55 coherently. Twins who survive into adulthood are treated during their lifetimes as ordinary mortals, but after death their supernatural associations re- assert themselves. The theory of prenatal memory is cited as the cause for fear of twins who die young. The supernatural twin, who died before he could forget his real nature and get used to his human role, feels no affinity with ordinary people and will play pranks and often cause harm. There- fore, rites designed to ensure that the twins will not become malevolent must be performed without fail. VIII. INCEST AND SIN The Nivkh, as already stated, consider incest a deadly sin; suicide by hanging is the only alterna- tive for those who commit it. The concept of sin is well defined. It includes murder, sacrilege, and transgressions against mar- ital order. Expiation of sin and settlement of debts are a matter of collective lineage responsibility, as is the maintenance of orderly relations between the natural and supernatural world. The conceptual world view of the Nivkh is further complicated by the fact that each lineage practices forms of worship common to all Nivkh, but with specific variations peculiar to a given lineage. Each lineage has its own variation of rituals, pro- hibitions and observances which outsiders may ridicule. Thus, sin in the sense of taboo violation in some cases may be defined as lineage- specific. This is particularly true in regard to conceptualiza- tion of the relationship between humans and ani- mals, each lineage having a specific animal of special significance to it. IX. EVIL SPIRITS In addition to the spirits of the elements and forces of nature, manifestations of the universe, the Nivkh world is populated with a host of lesser creatures of various kinds, usually bent on doing mischief to the human race. They are the miVk and kinr who may appear in a variety of guises - stone, animal, but most often in the form of a reptile, toad or lizard. They can be found in all four elements. A whole clan, uchkhu rash, resides in the sea and endangers those Nivkh engaged in seal hunting (Shternberg, 1893:20; 1904b:II:45-46). Some of these spirits confine themselves to minor forms of mischief - to theft, for example; others empty traps and snares of game; but the most malevolent will not stop short of causing death (Shternberg, 1904b:II:46). To guard against the in- finite variety of ways in which a man and his family may be harmed by these creatures who range from pranksters to murderers, the Nivkh have a whole arsenal of magical observances, preventive and corrective means, ranging from incantations of magical formulas and ritual performances to the constant wearing of good luck charms and amulets. Evil spirits that cause illness, sometimes by them- selves and sometimes on behalf of ill-intentioned shamans or other ill-wishers, are exorcised either by magical practices prescribed by custom or by shamanistic divination. Death, except in cases of death by violence and, very rarely and just barely possible, in extremely old age, is the consequence of actions by evil spirits or of evil doers who em- ploy the former.* X. SHAMANS™ Shamans in Nivkh society played an important role as healers, exorcisers of evil spirits and diviners, but had absolutely no role in religious observances. They were excluded, that is no shamanistic activity could go on, during all lineage rituals, and they were specifically barred from such important ceremonies as the bear festival and the feeding of the waters. Shternberg considered that Nivkh religious life was centered around their so- cial structure and was ancestor- oriented, while the shamanistic beliefs and practices were borrowings from their Tungus/Manchu neighbors (1904b:47-42; 1933:309-311; 322-325; 1893:22-23). Shamans were divinely elected. It was not a privilege but a burden. One could not become a shaman by study, training or application; one had to be "called." Usually, a person became conscious of the fact that he had been called after an excep- tional, often traumatic, experience, most often after a severe illness. Once elected to this status, which set him apart from the rest of his compatriots, the shaman acquired supernatural helpers of two kinds, kekhn and kenchkh. The first execute the most im- portant tasks the shaman gives them, including carrying the shaman's soul even into other worlds when he is seeking the stolen soul of his patient. On the question of death from old age, the evidence is inconclusive. Kreinovich (1930a) re- ports that in discussing the death of animals his informants vehemently rejected the possibility of death from old age. Animals could die only through violence or through the action of evil spirits. There- fore, no Nivkh would touch, not to mention use, an animal found dead in the forest. They seem to have been somewhat more willing to admit that humans could die of old age without an evil agency neces- sarily participating in the process.</page><page sequence="56">56 Arctic Anthropology X-l Fig. 23. a_ Shaman performing a curing ceremony; b healing amulets (1, 2), fish figures of unknown function (4, 5), child's toy representing a dog (6); c; shaman's paraphernalia; ci toad figure; £ white whale, toad and "crocodile" (all from Shrenk).</page><page sequence="57">Black: The Nivkh 57 Kekhn appear in many forms, such as animals, sea lions, owls, which are manifestations of their ulti- mate "master's" nature. They are capable of as- suming any form and thus can penetrate any ele- ment (Shternberg, 1904b:II:47). Kenchkh, on the other hand, help the shaman in his practice. It is he who helps the shaman to do all those magical things that make his contact with the supernatural effective: he unloosens the thongs with which the shaman's hands were tied behind his back, enables him to sing while his throat is being closed by a tight noose, etc. (Shternberg, 1933:324). Shamans have three basic methods of curing. The first consists of interpreting the dreams he has in connection with the case at hand. On the basis of these dreams he recommends the proper magic ritual or remedy to effect a cure. The second method is exorcism, by sound, motion, or invocation of spirit help. The third method involves long distance therapy. The sick person unable to reach a shaman immediately, such as one stricken away from home or at night, goes outside, makes an offering to the supernatural, and calls on any shaman to help. It is believed that a shaman, usually resident in the patient's village, will hear him and immediately begin the curing ceremony and the illness will be overcome. In spite of the fact that shamans are excluded from Nivkh religious rituals, that they play a sub- ordinate role in Nivkh ideology and, according to Shternberg, have much less importance in Nivkh life than among other Siberian tribes, they never- theless are believed to possess powers of extraordi- nary dimensions, even the ability resurrect the dead, create fish, cause storms, and commit murder at a distance by magical means. It is believed to be very dangerous either to interfere with a shaman or to fail to comply with his instructions. As mentioned in the discussion of the Nivkh concepts of the soul, it is believed that shamans may steal the soul of a deceased person, especially if he himself had maliciously caused that person's death. Kreinovich writes: The Gilyak attempt to protect the kinsman's soul, not to surrender it to the shaman, to escort it to the village of the dead. For this person, the Gilyak make the pyvd. This custom consists in the following: several men remain near the corpse and guard him through the night. In the night the corpse is approached by different birds, animals, until it is approached by a bear or tiger or even the sea lion (Gilyak, sitting silently nearby, can hear how the soul of the dead cries out in fright). They shoot this animal, which disappears, sometimes leaving a bloody trail. Afterwards, they usually learn that during this night somewhere a shaman died (1930a:101). Thus, the shaman's position is an ambiguous one: he is the healer, whose help is sought; and he may be the killer - feared, hated and to be de- stroyed. XI. THE LIFE CYCLE39 Children are desired very much; numerous chil- dren are a source of prestige, especially for the father. The Nivkh pray for many children. Infer- tility in a woman is a cause for divorce and often the reason for a man to take a second wife. If the latter is blessed with children, she may displace the first wife as mistress of the household. Fertil- ity, however, in the Nivkh view may be acquired by contagion; a childless woman seeks to remedy the situation by a variety of means. The most potent is considered to be a belt, a present from her hus- band's brother's wife who presumably has many children. Women also wear a bitch's tooth to ward off the misfortune of sterility. After the birth of the first child, the parents cease to be called by their own names and are addressed as father and mother of so-and-so (i.e. teknonyms). When a woman be- comes pregnant her daily routine does not change in any way. She continues to perform her household tasks no matter how heavy, including chopping wood and manning the oars in her husband's boat when the occasion demands, as the man must oc- cupy the prestigious place at the helm, his by right. No statistics are available, but Pilsudski (1910) states that miscarriages were frequent and attributes this to the fact that a woman performs heavy labor throughout her pregnancy. Certain magical precau- tions are taken to avoid miscarriage. The Nivkh consider that abortion is caused by sudden fright, meeting a stranger, a sudden movement or a blow, especially across the face. Even if one of her children strikes her accidentally, a miscarriage may follow. Therefore, all concerned take great care to avoid such accidents and, if inadvertently one or the other occurs, amends are made, usually by a ritual gift to the pregnant woman and symbolic action de- signed to counteract the offence. Thus, for ex- ample, a man should not under any circumstances chop wood across the footsteps of a pregnant woman- that is, on the path she has walked. Nivkh women know that abortions may be in- duced artifically, and young unmarried women who become pregnant have reportedly been known to re- sort to the same means believed to cause the natural abortions. As these means often fail, as they must, infanticide is frequent. Successful pregnancy is conceived in terms of</page><page sequence="58">55 Arctic Anthropology X-l binding, securing; birth and abortion in terms of loosening, unbinding. Therefore, pregnant women may not engage in tasks that may make delivery difficult, such as weaving of nets, sewing clothing and cutting and sewing footwear which when fin- ished will be taken outside the household and/or given to a stranger. After the seventh month of pregnancy, the woman's husband also may not go on a hunt to put up snares. In the last month of pregnancy, no one in the household may tie any- thing securely, especially knots, nor repair any item for a stranger, or erect poles. The sex of the newborn may be predicted in a variety of ways. A woman knows by the nature of her dreams before pregnancy if she picked up the soul of a boy - symbolized in long pointed objects - or the soul of a girl, symbolized by round objects and by a mollusk. Or, she dreams that in lezang, the sacred ritual barn, she picked up a bow and arrow - a boy - or a spoon and earrings - a girl. The shape of the woman's stomach is also an indi- cation of the sex of the child: a pointed stomach indicates that a boy will be born, a flattish broad shape indicates a girl. The Nivkh believe that a son will be born eventually, and after the birth of four girls in succession the fifth child is bound to be a boy. The woman also knows by the nature of her dreams who among the Masters of the elements sent the child's soul to enter her womb. Pregnant women are considered in some re- spects dangerous and their behavior is circum- scribed by many ritual prohibitions. A pregnant woman may not look upon the Amur at the time of the ice breaking, otherwise the river may not be- come ice free as rapidly as is desirable. If a hunter kills a female dolphin that is pregnant, a pregnant woman may partake of the animal's flesh only if her own fetus is older than that of the dolphin. (It is not stated how the relative age of the fetuses is determined.) Nivkh women and girls are absolutely forbidden to laugh when pregnancy and birth are discussed. To do so would have very grave consequences - difficult pregnancy and de- livery or worse - for the offender. The well being of a woman about to give birth and that of the newborn infant is the concern of both husband and wife. Birth itself is, apparently, considered unclean, polluting. It may not under any circumstances occur in the house. A flimsy birth hut is constructed. It is called lanraf and is built by the pregnant woman's husband. Pilsudski claimed that lanraf were located by custom near or within the area used by women for excretion. He wrote: The location of this place is always pre- cisely determined and no male ever comes near it. Even young boys are forbidden to run in this direction and to snoop near it, and they are warned that should they come in contact even with a trace of menstrual blood they will fall victims to a dreaded sickness, taremynd. This sickness begins with paralysis of arms and legs, until the patient loses all ability to move and dies. The disease is incurable (1910:156). Kreinovich states that the birth huts were built near the dwellings but away from the places used for excretion (1930:91). No ritual offerings may be made within the lanraf (Shternberg, 1933:336). In order to prevent entry of malignant spirits into the lanraf an axe and a knife are placed near the entry. Birth takes place in these huts in all seasons, no matter what the weather. Blood shed at the time of birth is considered even more polluting (or power- ful) than menstrual blood. As the first labor pains set in, the woman strips off her long underpants, puts on her oldest and dirtiest clothing, such as is worn during menstrual periods, unbraids her hair and goes to the birth hut. If the woman needs help, an old woman will join her, and occasionally her husband may enter the hut; however, during birth itself the husband may not enter (Kreinovich, 1930a:91). All other males, even the husband's brother who has sexual rights to the woman, are prohibited entry. Her own brothers are under an absolute prohibition, as even a drop of their sister's blood is fatally dangerous to them (Kreinovich, 1930a:91). At this time the husband and the other women of the household unbind and untie everything that has been fastened in the dwelling. The husband takes apart the sledges, his gun, unties his boat, removes the arrows from his quiver, loosens his belt and bindings on his sleeves and leggings, opens storage boxes and trunks, and unbraids his hair. When everything possible has been "loosened," the husband approaches the hut and announces to his wife: ryrund - "it is unfastened" (Kreinovich, 1930a: 91).* During confinement the woman assumes a sitting position on a small low bench built into the birth hut in the same fashion and at the same height as the sleeping bench in the dwelling. It is a sin to scream during childbirth, and in general the woman must attempt to sit quietly in the prescribed posi- tion. Should* a woman thrash around, it is the duty of the attendant to keep her in place by firmly grabbing her by the shoulders. The Nivkh believe that women who attempt to rise in the course of birth fall prey to an illness which results in extreme An aborted fetus is also designated ryrund (Kreinovich, 1930a:91).</page><page sequence="59">Black: The Nivkh Fig. 24.

In cases of difficult delivery, the attendant in a sud- den movement strikes the woman across the face with the hem of her dress. As the attendant is usually a woman who has given birth to many chil- dren, a stroke of her garment must bring a speedy delivery.* The husband, in the meantime, may not engage in any work nor is he permitted to leave the house. Shrenk reports that wood figurines of women in childbirth are carved in order to facilitate delivery (1903:III:Pl. LIV:6). The mother herself takes up the child and cuts and ties the umbilical cord. The cord is cut by a ritual knife with a curved blade used exclusively for this purpose (see Fig. 15b). To induce a rapid separation of the placenta, the woman is given the shavings of the bitter wood Sambucus racemosa which induces vomiting. The woman wraps up the placenta, called "the child's food," in dry grass, ties it up and it is placed out- side on one of the main poles of the hut. In the postnatal period the woman disposes of the dry moss she has used as pads to absorb the bleeding in the same manner and in the same place as the placenta. When the postnatal bleeding stops, the woman carefully places all these in a container made of a portion of a hollow birch trunk and finally disposes of them at a special place in the forest in a birch tree (Kreinovich reports that his findings on these matters remained rather sketchy [1930a:93]). Following the birth, young women are en- couraged to move about as much as possible, while older women are advised to rest frequently in a sitting position. The woman and her child remain in the birth hut for a period of time variously reported to last from a day and a half to three for a boy and four for a girl (Taksami 1961:162). During her seclusion the woman performs daily ablutions. The newborn infant is referred to as "The One Who Possesses the Penis," if a boy, or "Tailless One," if a girl (Pilsudski, 1910:758). An infant born in the "cowl" (membrane) is considered to be a harbinger of good fortune for the entire family. In such cases the cowl is dried and preserved with great care. The mouth of the newborn is cleaned with a finger and the child is then immediately put to the breast. The next day, the child is washed with cold water which the mother first takes from a container into her mouth (Pilsudski, 1910:758). During her confinement and immediately follow- ing, the woman may not drink cold water nor eat certain types of fish, namely fish that has red colored meat. No salt may be used. No hot broth may be carried to the woman from the house. She may not eat the crowberry (Empetrum nigrum) a black berry that grows in the tundra. Food prohi- bitions do not apply in case of twin births. The woman may not leave the hut and must tend her needs herself. Only during the most ex- treme frost, as an exception, were women known to enter their own dwellings. No other household would grant such a favor (Pilsudski, 1910:759). Before reentering the dwelling the new mother undergoes a purification ritual. It is called psarnd which Kreinovich glosses as "to cure oneself" and is in form reminiscent of several curing ceremonies. Rocks heated to white hot or burning coals are placed on or under a bed of aromatic shavings of Ledum palustre , the narrow leaved Labrador tea. This is covered with a layer of bark, and the woman sits over the hot steam (Kreinovich, 1930a:93). Before return to the house the woman may also change her clothing. Zolotarev reports that the dress she wears during childbirth, considered un- clean, is wrapped in birchbark and disposed of in a tree behind the settlement (1933:64) but Taksami states that it was kept for the next confinement (1961:162). Taksami says: "After giving birth, when the woman entered or exited from the house, the fire was shielded from her, covered, or put out. This was done for 3 days. The Nivkh believed that otherwise the fish catch would fail" (1961:162). Zolotarev also believed that a woman giving birth was considered as a polluting danger to the hearth and fire (1933:64).** Even after the purification ceremony, the woman may not fully join in the life of the household. Until the navel of the newborn heals and the rem- nant of the umbilical cord falls off, she may not eat at the common hearth, but has a separate fire made for her in a corner. When the child's umbili- cal cord has fallen off and the navel is healed, an offering to the fire and hearth, the "feeding," takes place, and the woman ceases to be unclean and be- comes once again pure; her husband may chop wood in the path she walked (Shternberg, 1933:336). The woman sleeps separately until postnatal bleeding stops. Infanticide apparently was frequent and is mentioned by several authors but no precise details are given. Pilsudski states that girls who gave birth to illegitimate children committed infanticide It will be remembered that a sudden stroke across the face is believed to bring on miscarriage or premature delivery. I am aware that Shrenk and Shternberg be- lieved otherwise, that the Nivkh had no purification ritual for the woman after giving birth. However, Kreinovich made specific inquiries into the question and his evidence seems sound.</page><page sequence="61">Black: The Nivkh qi (1910:760). Shrenk reports that illegitimate chil- dren were put to death by the girl's father and the body buried secretly, but that boys sometimes were spared (1903:111:18). In Shternberg's rather frag- mentary notes, published posthumously, is found a statement that infanticide was done in secret, and that infants born to a legal wife of a husband much younger than herself who could not possibly have been the father, were ordered killed by the "hus- band's" father (1933:337). When twins were born, sacrifices were made on the cremation site of an ancestor who either died by drowning or was killed by a bear and was believed to belong to the lineage of the Master of the respective element. From the day the newborn infant was brought into the dwelling, he became the object of his parents' tender loving care. The indulgent, loving attitude of the Nivkh to their children and the great care devoted to them has been remarked by many investigators and travellers who had the oppor- tunity to observe Nivkh daily life (Hawes, 1904). The infant was named when he was brought into the dwelling or soon after birth. There is con- flicting testimony on this point as well as to the procedure of name giving. Shrenk reported that the child was named by the evening of the day of the birth or in the morning, if the child was born at night (1881-1895:111:642). Kreinovich states that name giving takes place in the house, and only if there is fear that evil spirits are present near the birth hut is the child given a name there. Names were either ancestral, usually belonging to the third ascending generation, or invented to reflect certain qualities. Names were lineage property and other lineages could not use them. If a name be- longing to another lineage was used, the users were under obligation to give the other lineage one of their names (Shternberg, 1933:337)." Each per- son, however, had more than one name, at least two, the real name, urlan kha, and the "jesting name," lerund kha. Nivkh were reluctant to di- vulge their real names, as such knowledge could be dangerous in the possession of an ill-intentioned person. Young men never used real names of ven- erable elders, especially taking care not to pro- nounce such real names in the presence of the elders, as a token of respect. When a person died, it was assumed that he acquired a new name and his earthly name was not pronounced again by his relatives or friends. Panfilov analyzed the multiple name giving custom (1962:1:57-59). Taksami, him- self a Nivkh, concurs with Panfilov 's analysis and with the statement that the identity of person and name was assumed, and for this reason in families where many children had died, a newborn was given a new, invented name, or one not previously used by the lineage and not that of a deceased relative. Taksami denies that it was the father's function to name the newborn. He states that the Nivkh be- lieved that a child named by the parents would die, and that on the day of the birth the oldest male member of the community named the child in the following ritual: he spat on a piece of finely worked birchbark and declared: "Henceforth thy name will be such and such," after which he brought the birchbark to the parents and announced to them the child's name. The Nivkh believed that the name reflected qualities of character and the parents' preferences and occupation or possibly those of an ancestor. If it was claimed that traits peculiar to a deceased ancestor appeared in a child, the Nivkh said that "becoming his blood he came11** (Taksami, 1967:222-224). The umbilical cord was considered a part of the child's being. After the newborn infant was brought into the house, no member of the household, not even guests who came to spend the night, could depart from the village or even leave the house until the navel healed and the remnant of the cord had dropped off. The child's father and mother were not permitted to do any work at all until this hap- pened. After the umbilical cord separated, the father performed the ritual of "feeding": offerings were made to the fire, the Master of the Forest and the Master of the Waters. All portions of the um- bilical cord, properly dried, were inserted into the center of a specially prepared inau. The curled shavings were then tied with a thong and a stylized human figure carved at one end. The inau, with the umbilical cord enclosed within, was placed over the child's cradle. When the youngster was old enough, he was given this inau to take into the forest and place it in the crotch of a tree. The umbilical cord could never be disposed of in water (Kreinovich, 1930a:94). Care for the child's well- being began, however, well before it was brought into the house. Two small sticks were cut and placed in the infant's hands. When the child fas- tened his fingers around the sticks, he was gently pulled up. The same procedure was followed when the infant became ill. If twins were born, two pair of sticks were made and carved in parallel designs. Two small bows and arrows of special form and special thongs for each cradle were made for twins (Shternberg, 1933:305-306). Sons were brought into the house, not through the entrance, but through a ^It should be noted that traditional tales and myths were also owned by lineages (Kreinovich, 1929:99). In obvious reference to association of blood with soul.</page><page sequence="62">62 Arctic Anthropology X-l hole dug beneath the rear wall of the dwelling. The father dug this hole, even in winter, removing the snow. The father dragged the child through from the inside and brought it to the threshold. The mother, accompanied by a specially chosen young girl, of the prescribed degree of relationship (father's sister's daughter, or father's younger brother's daughter), came through the door and stepped over the child (Kreinovich, 1930:94). The infant was placed then into the prepared cradle. To ward off evil spirits, the cradle was fumigated by burning pieces of a fungus which grows on aspen and birch and is used as tinder. Three pieces were burnt if the child was a boy, four if a girl. To ward off a specific category of sea- dwelling evil spirits, skin from a rabbit's head was placed near the cradle. Sometimes a Japanese saber sheathed in birchbark was used instead of a pole to hang up the cradle. Both the pole and the saber were believed to possess the properties capable of warding off evil (Kreinovich 1930a:95). As the child grew, miniature articles of clothing were made for him, and buttons were sewn into the soles of his "stockings" or booties, also to ward off any possible contamination by malignant influ- ences. Miniature objects, such as bows and ar- rows of fir and larch wood (the arrows of three kinds: with a dull point, with a sharp point, with a double point), an axe and a knife if the child was a boy, and a net or seine of nettle thread and such items as spoons, if the child was a girl, were made and placed near the child's place, often on the occasion of its first illness. Old and respected men and women would bind nettle thread and dog hair onto the child's limb, three for a boy, four for a girl, to ensure good luck. Sometimes hair from the old people's heads was used (Kreinovich, 1930a: 96). Infant mortality was high, and if a woman had lost many children previously, she would bite off the tip of the left little finger of the infant to en- sure his survival, as other means might prove in- sufficient. A more drastic method to ensure the newborn1 s life was its incorporation into another lineage. The child's father called in a member of a wife-taking lineage. Not everyone was eligible; the candidate must be a man of probity, of proven good fortune manifest in material success and, above all, in the number of his healthy children. The infant, regardless of sex, was formally be- trothed to that man and thus forthwith belonged to him and his lineage. The evil spirits who worked against the child were thus rendered powerless (Kreinovich, 1930:98-99). The inference is that particular evil spirits can work only against a specific lineage. The father selected a young sapling outside the dwelling for each child, probably a fir, and deco- rated it with inau. At the base of this tree the ex- crement of the child was deposited. Also placed here was the hair after haircutting when the child grew old enough for that procedure. Great care was taken that this tree was never polluted by menstrual blood. It was believed that if the tree died, so did the child. Fathers also built a sort of protective shrine for their newborn children. A father uprooted two evergreen saplings, leaving the roots intact, and decorated the crowns with birchbark and inau, ceremonial sharpened sticks or points, k'khong tsakh, the head of a pike fish and clothing hooks. The whole was surrounded by a palisade made of sticks with bundles of Ledum palustre (the narrow leaved Labrador tea) tied to them. If the child died, this was abandoned; if the child lived, it was used for the next child. It is possible that such shrines were erected only for boys. Shternberg's notes, from which this information was taken, are incon- clusive on this point (1933:306), but the Nivkh definitely gave preference to male children. Pro- tective amulets were made by the father in all pos- sible contingencies, including cases when the child had nightmares (Shternberg, 1933:306). The daily care for the infant was, of course, the mother's task. For the first fifteen days of its life it was washed with the mother's milk. She squeezed a drop from her breast onto a piece of soft moss and used this as a sponge. Later, the child was washed daily in cold water, warmed slightly in the mother's mouth. This was done until the child was one year old. After that, only his face was washed.* The children were taught from an early age to assume their proper sex roles. The great variety of toys made for the children reflected this tendency in Nivkh childhood education. Children were greatly indulged. Men and women, reportedly very re- served in affective expression, were free in ex- pressing their love for and pleasure in their children (Shternberg, 1933; Hawes, 1904). Sons were taught all the necessary skills by their fathers so that by the age of twelve or so a young Nivkh was, in Shternberg's words, "an accomplished gentleman." Elders taught the young historical and mythological traditions by reciting the epics. It was imperative that each learn his genealogy well, since in the complex social structure of the Nivkh it was neces- sary to know precisely in which lineages one might seek a wife -and into which lineages a girl could marry, as well as on whom one had a right to call in case of need. Shternberg tells us that genealogy Shrenk, who once observed the procedure of face washing, remarked that the reluctance of small boys to submit to such treatment seemed to be uni- versal.</page><page sequence="63">Black: The Nivkh £3 was the main course in the Nivkh curriculum. Moral values were taught by parents; a good father was one who taught his son not to offend or ridi- cule anyone (Shternberg, 1933). Children were taught early to observe the rules of avoidance be- tween siblings. Good parents took care, almost from the day of the child's birth, to arrange a proper, if possible pure, marriage with a member of the mother's lineage for a boy, and with a mem- ber of the lineage into which the father's sisters had married for a girl. Parents also made every effort to amass a respectable dowry for a daughter or a bride gift for a son. Girls, as they grew older, were often sent for extended visits into the families they would enter as wives. Mothers taught the girls skills desired in a good wife: dressing fish, preparing yukola, the proper manner of skinning, quartering and cutting up animals of all sorts, and making thread, but foremost the arts of cooking, sewing and embroidery. Parents took great care that all rituals de- signed to prevent illness and ensure good luck for their children were observed throughout childhood. The Nivkh had no puberty rites. It was recog- nized that a girl reached sexual maturity with the onset of menstruation. Thereafter, she wore her hair in two braids. No sexual relations were per- mitted with a girl who had not yet menstruated. Men who took child- brides into their households and slept with them on the same sleeping bench under the same blanket reportedly abstained from intercourse until the girl(s) informed them that she had had a menstrual period (Shternberg, 1933). Each person had a dog dedicated or assigned to him or her at a very young age and this affinity lasted to the end of the person's life. This aspect of Nivkh belief, however, is closely tied in with lineage ritual and will be discussed at length later. A boy reached the state of adulthood almost imperceptibly: the outward sign was the growth of a mustache. It was said that he was now a man who noticed his body. Early in life a Nivkh male became proficient in fishing, hunting, equipment making, boat and house building and wood carving. Under the Nivkh marriage system his father saw to it that he had a suitable wife. If there had been a child betrothal, his bride usually resided with him in his father's house, and he assumed his conjugal role when both reached sexual maturity. A girl was instructed by her mother in the necessary care of her body upon reaching maturity; she explained the significance of menses and taught her proper ritual observances so that she would be a good wife in all respects. If a man was not married, he led a life as what could only be described by the old fashioned ex- pression "a gay blade." The behavior and amatory exploits of bachelors were described by Shternberg, and there is a delightful translation of this chapter by Chester S. Chard, entitled Sexual Life of the Gilyak (Chard, 1961). Shternberg believed that a Nivkh youth's preoccupation with the conquest of women was caused, at least partly, by the fact that under the existing system of marriage not everyone was provided with a wife at the onset of puberty. This situation was aggravated by the general im- balance in sex ratio among the Nivkh: men out- numbered women by far. By the rules of the game, all women, except those expressly forbidden, were fair game. Of course, amatory adventures among near neighbors met with a certain opprobrium, even if legally a liaison were permitted. Therefore the young un- married men departed on frequent visits, preferably to the villages of the fathers-in-law, the traditional wife-giving lineages to their own. There every young girl of the young man's own generation was, in the eyes of the law, his spouse in name if not in fact. A youth even travelled to villages where strangers lived to exercise his amatory skills. In the absence of their hosts, visitors were not averse to seducing their hostesses, as long as in- cest was not involved. Rape and seduction of girls was reportedly frequent, especially during the berry picking season when by necessity the women wandered away from the settlement. Shternberg re- ports veritable raids carried out by groups of young men for this purpose. The taste for conquest was not confined to youth. Men reported preserved these acquired habits of sexual freedom well into old age (Shternberg, 1933), but the double standard was strictly enforced. Women lost such freedom at marriage in practice if not in theory. Women caught at amatory pursuits, even if they were within their legal rights, often were beaten severely. Raids by young men on groups of women were ex- pressed as "hunts." However, individual cases of forced copulation resulted in beating and confisca- tion of dogs (Shternberg, 1933:335). Women were considered to be fickle. Shtern- berg cites proverbs to this effect: "A woman's character is like a whirlwind"; "with one pull one can turn a woman's character upside down"; a woman is like a fire made in an open field, the wind blows, the fire goes out" (1933:319). Women were the constant topic of discussion among young men: their beauty, their accomplishments, avail- ability, possibilities of capture, elopement, dangers of such enterprise, etc. In olden times, expeditions specifically organized to raid distant villages to capture women were reportedly common practice. Such enterprises inevitably, by the law of the blood feud, led to inter-lineage warfare; very often whole villages and lineages were wiped out in the en- suing conflict.</page><page sequence="64">64 Arctic Anthropology X-l In order to be successful, an individual em- barking upon a quest for women in distant parts had to be an accomplished master of the art of flirtation, which encompassed also story telling, singing and joking. Unmarried women who had not been betrothed in childhood had a degree of sexual freedom not permitted a legally married female. Parents some- times frowned upon liaisons of their daughters, but only if there was a suspicion that she had taken up with an undesirable young man, either from an economic or social point of view. If the girl be- came pregnant, her lover known, and there were no legal obstacles in the way, the pair were married. Often young people followed such a course be- cause then the bride gift was not expected to be especially high and the young man could afford to marry, which otherwise might not be the case. The situation became disastrous only if the lovers stood in a relationship that put them into forbidden cate- gories. In such cases, even parents of the young people involved urged suicide.* Women reportedly often left their husbands to escape an intolerable marriage. Recapture of a runaway has been de- scribed by Kreinovich. The injured husband was joined by his agnates or, if the village was a multi- lineage one, by males of his own generation co- resident in the settlement. The men, equipped with fast sleds and armed with spears, stealthily ad- vanced on the village where the woman had taken shelter, invariably her natal village. Reaching her dwelling, two men stood on guard with the sled; the others, led by the husband, broke into the hut and, while his companions held all adult males down by the arms in order to avoid bloodshed, he dragged his wife outside. There the two guardians of the sled had prepared loops of long thongs that were attached to the sled. The woman's feet were inserted into the loops and the husband whipped the dogs, dragging his wife over the hard snow. After several yards he stopped and inquired if the woman would ever try to run away again. The process was repeated several times and the woman's body was lacerated into a bloody pulp (Kreinovich, 1936:741). Love potions were used. Sometimes they were used by a young person whose object did not return 'his or her passion, sometimes by parents to excite proper feelings in their offspring toward the spouse that had been chosen for them. If a man fell in love with a married woman, he often abducted her, resisting recapture and even Suicide as a way to escape an unwanted marriage situation, especially on the part of women, is discussed in the section dealing with social organization. killing the lawful husband. When the Russian ad- ministration was established, such runaways often accepted baptism in order to escape the rules of their own group. The legal certificate issued by the Russian officials or the priest was often enough to stop the legal husband from taking vengeance. In other cases this was not so and tragedy, even to the point of murder, resulted. Shternberg (1933) re- ports such a case when a Nivkh, whose wife and her lover had followed such a course, killed his wife, her lover and himself. In a pathetic case, Bronislaw Pilsudski - who did so much in fostering better health among the Nivkh, taught Nivkh children to read and write, and preserved much of their folk- lore - was an agent in a family tragedy. A Nivkh whose wife left with her lover came to Pilsudski and asked him for a "paper." After arguing back and forth to the effect that he could not give an official document, Pilsudski scribbled on a piece of paper "It is not good to take away the wife of another man." The Nivkh was satisfied and, armed with this document, reclaimed his wife, whose lover surrendered her without opposition (Hawes, 1904: 263-264). Another illustration of the complex interpersonal relationships is the following case described by Shternberg (1933):** Men prefer to defend their right to love in a more active manner. Usually, with the help of their kinsmen, they will attempt to abduct the woman by force, nor will they balk at killing the husband of their beloved. One really outstanding instance of heroism in love I recorded in the same village of Nianivo. In my time the richest and most respected man of the local clan was a Gilyak by the name of Nyugun. In his younger years, his sweetheart had been forcibly married to another man, whereupon Nyugun killed the latter, for which he was arrested and transported to Nikolaevsk. During this interval the woman's brother again married her against her will to another husband. Escaping from prison, Nyugun set off immediately for the village of his sweetheart. As he approached her house he tore off all his garments except the short pants of modesty, notwithstanding the wintry weather, and in this condition burst into the room, which was crowded with people, and so frightened those present by his stalwart appearance that no hand was raised when he led his sweetheart out and took her home - after which they lived peacefully for many years. Translation by C. S. Chard, 1961.</page><page sequence="65">Black: The Nivkh 55 In cases where there were no legal obstacles, the girl and the young man were free; sexual rela- tionships between them were not forbidden, so that parents could not object without incurring social disapproval. Shy persons sometimes employed a go-between to tell the object of their love how they felt. Physical attributes played a large part in the attraction. Women praised men not only for ap- pearance and fitness of body, but also their ele- gance of attire and above all such qualities as manliness, courage, and steadfastness. In women, femininity expressed in slow, fluid movements (taught girls from an early age), her walk, low melodious voice, eyes modestly downcast, smooth skin, long luxurious sleek hair, and talents (such as the ability to compose songs) were qualities considered most desirable. Married love, deep, and tender, was frequent among the Nivkh. Often when one partner died, the other was inconsolable and committed suicide. Faithfulness in marriage was expected, and in spite of frequent reports of outstanding exceptions, fidelity was the rule. Men who visited households where the wife was in the class anjey to them, that is, legally accessible, seldom attempted to exer- cise these rights, and if they did, then only in the absence of the individual husband, that is the man who gave the bride gift for the woman. Pilsudski (1910) considered the status of women among the Nivkh to be deplorable. Other writers disagreed. Shternberg, in particular, noted that the woman was never considered a chattel and, with very rare exceptions, was a beloved daughter, loved wife and respected mother. When she died she was mourned most sincerely. Her children sought her advice in their own affairs of the heart and marital troubles. Her husband often consulted her. Her talents as a poet and singer were appreciated by her family and friends. Her skills as a seamstress and cook were a source of pride to her menfolk. Some women, famous for their wisdom, upon reach- ing old age even participated in the deliberations of the men on lineage affairs. When a man took a second wife, much more often than not the second wife was chosen with the first wife's consent and approval. Intrafamilial relationships in Nivkh society were characterized by mutual respect. While elders were recognized as guardians of the law and tradi- tion, even young boys were listened to with courtesy. The sociability and warmth was maintained by means of customary story telling which did not necessitate direct address - part of sibling avoid- ance rules - and also by the presence of persons of different generations and frequent guests from other lineages. Whereas the Nivkh have often been de- scribed as morose, in their own circle, among family and friends, they became garrulous and ex- pansive. As traders they were famous for their shrewdness and bargaining acumen. XII. ILLNESS, INSANITY, SEXUAL PERVERSION40 There is no specialized study, to my knowledge, devoted to the Nivkh conception and treatment of illness, except the shamanistic curing practices, nor is there one of Nivkh pharmacopaeia. Brief references are scattered throughout many ethno- graphic sources. The Nivkh recognized several types of illness. A smallpox epidemic, introduced by the Chinese, was dreaded above all other sickness. It was con- sidered to be caused by the blood shed in wars.* When an epidemic struck, the sick were brought water and wood, but the houses where they lay were not entered. Victims of the epidemic were hastily buried with little attention to traditional funeral ritual. When the epidemic had ended, the bodies were disinterred and remains cremated (Shternberg, 1933:319). A variety of nervous disorders were manifest. One of them was miariachenie , described by Shtern- berg as an illness in which women totally lost psychic self-control, turning to sexual excesses and debauchery. It is possible that in many nervous disorders syphilis may have been the underlying cause. The Nivkh considered that illness was sent by the ultimate agency of the Masters of the ele- ments, acting in such cases through a special evil spirit, mil'k, whom they selected from the element other than the particular Master's own. This illness- causing miVk could be of various forms, often red in color, as red as blood, as hard as rock. However, upon entering the human body, it became alive and moved around (Shternberg, 1933:338). MiVk also attacked dogs in addition to human beings.** Meriachenie, which bears a very considerable resemblance to glossolalia, was considered to be hereditary in the male line although afflicting per- sons of both sexes. It was manifested in the patient repeating all words and actions said or done in his or her presence, including words in foreign languages. The illness came in fits; during a fit the patient was not conscious but upon recovering apparently remem- bered what had happened. Sometimes persons suffer- See section on world view and the harmful phenomena associated with unavenged dead, especially strangers. **See section on ritual structure regarding af- finity between men and dogs.</page><page sequence="66">66 Arctic Anthropology X-l ing from this illness became violent and attacked those present (Shternberg, 1933:319). Another dis- order has been described both by Shternberg and Kreinovich. It was believed to be caused by de- sire for an object seen in a strange dwelling. This illness could be cured if the patient was given the object or a portion thereof (Shternberg, 1933:338; Kreinovich, 1955:157). Hysteria in many forms seems to have been present. Most commonly, hysteria manifestations were interpreted as elec- tion to shamanism, which was open to both sexes. Intestinal disorders in children were treated by magical methods, the most effective one being performed by parents. The parent of the same sex as the child collected the sick child's excrement and put it on a piece of yukola, and then he or she attempted to feed this to the parent of the opposite sex. Illness among adults and, in general, illness of a more serious nature demanded the help of a shaman. Skin disorders, especially leprosy, were in this category (Shternberg, 1933:310-311). Insanity was recognized. Violently insane per- sons in summer were kept in a sort of a cage con- structed of logs and were fed. It was prohibited to kill them. When an insane person died, the usual funeral rites were not performed and the body was buried in the ground (Shternberg, 1933:338). People saved from drowning or from attack by bear underwent special rituals and offered sacri- fices. Shternberg described the procedure followed in cases of drowning and rescue. All who were in the vicinity rushed to the assistance of a drowning person. When he was pulled ashore, his abdomen was pressed, the mouth cleaned with wood shavings and a stick inserted into the cavity, presumably to keep the air passage open. He was wrapped in warm fur coats and carried into the dwelling with his face covered, for if he looked upon the fire death was sure to follow. When the person recov- ered, he made a sacrificial offering to the Master of the Waters, together with the person most di- rectly responsible for saving him. Then they per- formed the ceremony of shavynd. The rescuer and the rescued sat facing each other. Before each was placed a bowl of berries flanked by grass. Near each was placed a white dog. Each held a hook in hand and the two men hooked each other. They pulled with the hooks, each saying "You will live till old age and so will I. " When the rescued was leaving, he stepped with one foot into the bowl he used, stepping with the other into the bowl of his rescuer, and the bowls were exchanged as the rescued said the word of gratitude: nikhkhakhra.* This exchange was imperative, otherwise one of the two people involved would drown shortly. A sha- man's assistance was also required. He sent his helpmate, kekhn, to reclaim the "little soul" of the rescued from the Master of the Waters. If the rescue was by boat, the individual, together with his wife, had to break an old utensil and then the man had to make a new one, otherwise both he and his spouse would die (Shternberg, 1933:338). A person mangled by a bear was brought home and laid in the place of honor. If he survived his wounds, he sacrificed a dog and made an elaborate offering to the Master of the Forest (Shternberg, 1933:339). Sexual perversion, according to Shternberg, was extremely rare. He reports that no instance of homosexuality could be ascertained but his account of two cases he calls "hermaphrodism" leads one to believe at least that one may have been a homo- sexual union and the other a case of transvestism (Shternberg, 1933:256, 257). According to Shternberg "hermaphrodism" was regarded by the Nivkh as a slightly anomalous but natural occurrence and he states that "hermaphroditic marriages are an ordi- nary phenomenon" (1933:256). In contrast to this attitude he cites the attitude toward bestiality, which he states met with the greatest repugnance. Shternberg reports that in Nivkh mythology the tiger, the snow leopard and the lion were represented as people who were turned into beasts for abnormal sexual practices (1933:256). This report is some- what at odds with other data, such as the concept of twin birth, and certain myths which included im- portant elements involving sexual intercourse be- tween men and beasts. Women were often suspected of mythical intercourse with forest animals and reptiles, believed to take place while they were asleep. There were even lineages that claimed descent from the issue of such unions (Kreinovich, 1929:98-99). XIII. DEATH AND FUNERAL RITUAL The question of death was of necessity touched upon in the section discussing the Nivkh concept of the soul. As mentioned earlier, death is conceived as the separation of the soul, incorporated in the blood, from the body, symbolized by bones. A soul was immortal, at least for a span of several gen- erations; death was a transition from one condition to another, from the world of the living, the middle land, to another world. Since this other world was subdivided into categories, along the horizontal and vertical axis, there were naturally several possible destinations which were determined by the manner of death, and reflected in the funeral rites. There were two basic categories of death: ^Compare with the exchange of kettles in the wedding ceremony and exchange in the course of the bear ritual symbolizing lasting relationships.</page><page sequence="67">Black: The Nivkh 57 determinate natural agency and indeterminate un- natural one. In the first category fell death from all forms of violence, human, animal and natural elements; into the other all other cases of mortality automatically assumed to be the result of evil forces at work. There is an indication that the Nivkh may have performed post-mortems to ascertain the nature of the evil spirit which had caused death and also to destroy it. If the evil spirit resident in the body of the deceased was not removed, this spirit could continue to possess the power to harm other lineage members. Unfortunately, information on this sub- ject in the sources is very scant (Taksami, 1967: 222). I shall discuss first the funeral rites for per- sons who died of disease or old age - in our terms natural, and in Nivkh terms unnatural, death. The rites for the dead consisted of several elements, some stressing the change of status and having all the characteristics of the rites of passage. These were performed at stated intervals beginning with the care of the body, through disposal of the body by cremation, except in extraordinary circumstances, erection of the memorial shrine and burial of the ashes, and ending with a memorial feast. The final act, however, was performed sometimes as much as three to four years after the actual death and ap- parently had the function of signaling the end of mourning and restitution of the order broken by the death, the reunification of the lineage in a new alignment. This was the bear festival and probably also the rite performed over the carcass of the killer whale. These rituals will be discussed separately, as they reflect and reinforce the Nivkh concept of social and universal order. Only the rites of passage accompanying a case of death will be discussed here. The Nivkh are not afraid of the dead or the dying. When it is realized that death is near the dying person is surrounded by kin. Relatives prop him up on both sides so that the dying person is kept in a sitting position until he dies. The body is placed on the center back sleeping bench, the place of honor, legs bent at the knee, soles of the feet placed flat on the bench. The body is kept in this position by means of thongs. Hands are folded on the chest and the hair is unbraided. The head is raised on cloth or straw, facing toward the west, as it is believed that both entrance to the mly vo and mly vo itself, the land or village of the dead, lie in the direction of the setting sun. A ceaseless watch is kept beside the body and all lineage members, no matter where they live, are notified of the death. At night two lamps are lit: one is kept in its usual place; the second is a special lamp placed at the corpse's head. When morning breaks, the lamp at the head of the corpse is put out first, otherwise other members of the family will die. All lineage kinsmen make every possible effort to attend the wake. All who can possibly squeeze in gather in the dwelling where the body is laid out. Often, the place is so crowded that many must stay in the passage (Taksami, 1967: 221-222).* The body is not washed, but dressed in gar- ments specially made for the funeral, of cotton or silk, part of the prestige goods nominally con- sidered lineage property. No fish, dolphin nor animal skins may be used, in order to keep any trace of fat from contaminating the funeral pyre.** Cloth that is decorated with intricate patterns is not used, as these may cause the soul to lose its way to the underworld. Garments are made by all women present. The stitching must be loose; tight stitching of funeral garments is a sin. The corpse is dressed by its nearest relatives: the wife by the husband, the husband by the wife, a child by par- ents and a parent by children. The cloth selected for funeral garments is mostly white. The funeral hat, hak, resembling in cut the children's hat, is white, as must be the n'akhair, a three finger broad band used to cover the eyes. In addition to the above mentioned garments, the symbolic sig- nificance of which is not known to me, is a shirt, I'arkh, white without the usual quilted lining (this feature, the absence of lining, is imperative), with- out the customary belt or pants of modesty; legg- ings, p'an specially made cloth slippers of the same cut for women and men with short uppers, put onto naked feet; mittens, vamykh, their color im- material, with one thumb and without sleeve cuffs; a belt, vigvyr, made specially of white cotton cloth and, for men, two sheaths of the same material and one flint and tinder pouch; for both men and women a cloth tobacco pouch is made - hontkh. Tobacco is placed in this pouch as well as into mly, the flint and tinder pouch. Tobacco, pipe and flint are placed on the corpse's breast. Earrings and brace- lets are removed (Shternberg, 1933:325-326). The mourners take turns puffing on this pipe and blow- ing smoke into the corpse's face. At the head the wife, a near relative or an old man or woman of the lineage places a small wooden bowl with food, cold water, or alcoholic drink; the mourners from time to time consume these offerings and the bowls are It is not clear whether, as Taksami says, the head of the corpse is toward the west or the face is toward the west, as is stated in Shternberg, 1904b:II. "^Kreinovich (1930a: 104) reports that his in- formant maintained that if a person died soon after eating seal, his body was opened and his intestines cleaned.</page><page sequence="68">68 Arctic Anthropology X-l refilled (Shternberg, 1933:326). Outside the dwell- ing rich garments of the shagund, the prestige goods store, are displayed. When the time comes for the cremation, the prestige garments will be heaped onto the corpse, in multiples of three for a man and multiples of two for a woman. The assembled lineage members and friends are fed from morning till night by the best products of the Nivkh kitchen; all from time to time make gestures of sharing the festive foods with the de- ceased. The wake lasts three days for a man and four for a woman. A show of grief is avoided: on the contrary, there is constant talk. Silence in the house at such a time is a sin (Shternberg, 1904b: 11:54). However, dancing, story telling and singing songs is not permitted. Some relatives must remain awake through the night. On the second day all men prepare wood for the funeral pyre. For adults only larch wood is used. Other kinds of wood such as fir or spruce are used only in areas where larch is not available. Chil- dren's corpses are burned on pyres of juniper.* Only trees of good quality are used. The trunk is split lengthwise and cut into logs of the same length, the exact measure varying with the lineage (Shternberg, 1933:327). The roots of the tree are left in place and the limbs discarded. The logs are carried to the lineage burial ground, raryf, and placed in a certain order: in three layers , the di- rection of the logs alternating.** On the last day of the wake the dwelling is cleaned, the floor swept, and the hearth cleaned (these actions are called tav mund and tugur mund respectively). In silence, a fire of fir is made on the hearth and the fire is "fed" with newly prepared mosr - the com- plex fish-skin based dish used in all rituals (Shternberg, 1933:327). Shternberg remarks paren- thetically that this action symbolizes the transition of the kinsman into the category of "new ancestor." After this , all is ready for the final act in which the transition from the world of the living to the world of the dead will be accomplished. All those present eat, and, when the meal is finished, a sled is brought into the house and the corpse lashed onto it. Four men carry the sled with the body to the burial ground. In carrying this bier they use one hand only, as in the other they hold the ritual sticks, inau. A dog, the pry ski, who has been se- lected either because it was the person's favorite dog or had a ritual association with him or her, and in whom for a while the small soul of the deceased will find abode, is either placed on the chest of the corpse or tied to the bier and led along (Shternberg, 1933:327; Kreinovich, 1930a:105). After the crema- tion, this dog will occupy a place of honor in the house, be treated with special kindness and after a certain specified time span will be given to the lineage of wife-takers. Along with the cortege, sometimes preceding it, are led the dogs to be sacrificed at the pyre. For an adult an entire sled team will be sacrificed as a rule. The flesh of sacrificed animals will form the main portion of the meal that will be held on the cremation site, but the disposition of parts of the bodies apparently varies from one group to another. At the cremation site, the bier is carried around the prepared pyre in the direction from east to west, three times if the deceased was a man, four times if a woman. At each corner the pallbearers stop, lower the bier to the ground and/or on the corner of the pyre itself, and touch the bier with inau. Kreino- vich explains that if this step were omitted, the soul would have to complete the long trek to the land of the dead without rest (1930a: 105). Finally the thongs securing the body are loos- ened, the body removed from the sled and placed on the pyre, and the sled and the dogs about to be sacrificed taken aside. The body reposes on the pyre in the same position as it was originally se- cured in the dwelling: facing west, palms on the breast, soles of feet flat on the wood. The imme- diate relatives, with hair unbound as a sign of mourning, climb the pyre and lament. The lamenting is done by a wife for a husband, by a mother for a child. If the deceased was a young man, unmarried, the wife of his elder brother, real or class if icatory (that is, the wife of a lineage kinsmen of his own generation, relative seniority determined by real age), performs this function. Lamenting is only per- formed by women. It is a sin for a man to cry or lament for the deceased with the sole exception of his wife, whom the husband is expected to lament. In the meantime, the oldest living males of the lineage make the fire with which the pyre will be lit , using the ancient wooden drill on a wooden base with a piece of sacred tinder. At this point, the shagund garments are heaped onto the corpse. Either the head of the deceased's household or an elder of the lineage, or, as happened in the case Shrenk witnessed, the wife, lights the pyre, first at the corpse's head, then at his feet. When the fire has been lit, everyone - men, women and children, even the smallest, pile on wood prepared beforehand. Men poke the fire with long poles to facilitate its burning, as the body must be totally consumed and only ashes left. If in the process the corpse's hands move from the prescribed position, this is a bad omen, presaging further death in the lineage, and attendants attempt to restore them to the I presume that juniper or possibly creeping cedar is meant. No Latin name is given and Shtern- berg uses the local Siberian name taVnik. **It may be that for a woman the number of layers was four (Kreinovich, 1930a: 104).</page><page sequence="69">Black: The Nivkh 69 Fig. 25a.

As the pyre burns, men break the sled on which the body was carried, smash kettles, bowls and weapons and sacrifice the dogs. The dogs are killed by strangulation, their heads at the moment of death are turned to the east if the animal is in- tended as a "messenger" or intermediary between the newly dead and the Master of the Forest, or to the sea if it is to serve in that capacity in respect to the Master of the Waters (Shternberg, 1933:327). The dogs are skinned and quartered but, accord- ing to ethnographic accounts, particularly Shtern- berg (1933:328), practices vary. The meat is usually consumed on the spot, cooked on a separate fire. Sometimes the meat is scattered around the pyre and the skin is also variously disposed of. The reasons for the varying practices are not clear. After the fire dies down, the dog pry ski is led into the dwelling and lives henceforth on the sleeping bench where the deceased person used to have his or her place. All feasts, except the meals held prior to the funeral, connected with the mortuary rites are held outside. None of the funeral dishes prepared for these feasts may be brought into a dwelling. Dur- ing the entire wake and funeral period all lineage members are forbidden to comb their hair, women to sit near the fire, or put dull spits into fish to be cooked (Zolotarev, 1933:65). The next morning immediate relatives return to the cremation site and carefully sweep up the ashes with eagle feathers. They then make a small square barrier of planks, cover the ashes with fir branches, cotton cloth, birchbark and boards in layers and fasten all to the ground by means of wooden hooks. A remnant of cranial bone is care- fully retrieved, wrapped in white cloth, and placed between two small planks that are fastened together with the umbilical cord of the deceased - "the root of a man's birth." This will later be placed into the mortuary memorial shrine or "house," raf. The construction of this memorial shrine may be de- layed (for example, it may not be constructed while the ground is frozen), but a very stylized wooden image is cut, dressed in miniature garments and equipped with all the paraphernalia of the living person, especially the belt with knife, needle case, etc. , as well as tinder and flint. This is placed on a board near, but not on, the cremation site. Next to it small sticks or poles are erected. To one is tied a human hair taken from the head of a near fe- male relative (wife, mother, sister), which will serve as the inner sole for footwear needed to cross into the other world. Next is a small pole, or rather a stick always with three forks, on which reposes the small bowl intended to ease the cuckoo's thirst; the third stick is decorated with an image of the cuckoo bird; the fourth with an eagle feather. A temporary mortuary memorial shrine, k'ak raf, is made of bark (Shternberg, 1933:307). Eventually, the mortuary memorial, raf, is con- structed. It is a small toy- like house, with a door and window. An image of the cuckoo is carved on the roof. The. raf is often covered with carved de- signs. The anthropomorphic human image, dressed in clothes made of pieces of silk, fur and other costly goods, is placed inside, as is the package with the cranial bone fragment and umbilical cord. Small wooden bowls for food offerings, tobacco and pipes are placed either inside or around it and the four small symbolic poles with their appurte- nances surround it. Lineage members observe a period called "caretaking of the tree": Periodically, all who possibly can assemble at the raf* and, even if no feast is held, smoke, drink and eat some food, a portion of which is scattered around. Shternberg reports that when a raf was made kins- men were forbidden to work, applying the same rule that governed their behavior on the day of the cre- mation (1933:329). The period of mourning appar- ently is variable. It is manifested by visits to the cremation site and the ra/with accompanying con- sumption and disposal of food, but the duration is reported as from one year to three or four. As the end of mourning approaches, a final feast is ar- ranged which marks the end of mourning. Once again all lineage members are called together to mark the end of "watching the tree," as the periodic remembrance observances are called. Shternberg, from whose account the above description is taken, writes: They buy vodka, rice, call together kins- men and affines and for three or four days come to the grave for the remembrance feast; this is the last remembrance (raf pykyz's; tigr pykyz's). They go to the cremation site and pour out vodka, pour out portions of all dishes, bring the favorite dog of the de- ceased and feed it. The dog is called prysk i (by the Gold: khan'a, soul); each man has his own pry ski, even a child. Everyone since childhood has his favorite dog and when a man dies either his favorite dog or the best of the sled team is selected and made pryski. If it dies, it is buried and covered with wood shavings. Each tells the deceased the following: "To live next to Shternberg (1933:330) believes that this hap- pens within two days to two or three months: Tak- sami states that a memorial feast is held after 40 days have passed - but this may be a borrowing from Russian Orthodox religious practice (1967:222).</page><page sequence="72">72 Arctic Anthropology X-l Fig. 27. Top: an unusually elaborate grave house; bottom-, grave marker in form of a loon (both from Shrenk).</page><page sequence="73">Black: The Nivkh 73 us is not your fate, in that case go to the dead, to the village of the dead (your own village of the dead). As you go, you will cross the river, and the cuckoo will call, long it will call and you shall awake. You shall arise and with eagle feathers you shall sweep away from yourself the ashes and coals, you will dress yourself, from the hair you will make the inner sole, you will put on the dress, the figure like a bridge will be; cuckoo from the bowl will drink as it will tire after calling so long. Go well, live well, keep the law of your fathers, of your mothers , of your elder brothers , go (1933:307-308). According to Taksami, this last big memorial feast was called "To abandon the tree." It was believed that at this point the dead irrevocably left this world. At this time, objects belonging to the dead person were brought to the site and often destroyed there (1967:221, 222; Shternberg, 1933:308). After an interval a bear will be raised and a bear feast given as the sign that order has been restored. Between the funeral and final leave taking none may hunt the bear. If it were attempted, the arrow would miss (Zolotarev, 1933:65). Failure on the part of lineage kinsmen to obtain a bear and conclude the cycle with a bear feast meets with outspoken opprobrium. According to a rather inconclusive note in Shternberg (1933:308) the widow (or perhaps any lineage woman?) may not marry until the final leave taking has taken place. The above described rituals are performed for adults of both sexes, but not when infants die. It is believed that if the body of an infant is cre- mated, its soul will not be able to return to the womb of its mother and she will not have children for a long time to come. There is a certain disagree- ment in the sources regarding observances followed in case of a child's death. Shternberg stated that when infants died in the first week of life their bodies were interred in trees, and those within the first six months of life were buried in the ground, with young fir trees dug up with roots intact placed on the grave (1933:308). Kreinovich, who specifi- cally investigated funeral rituals, reports that in- fants under one year of age were interred in trees , but bodies of older children were cremated. Special huts filled with child's toys were erected near the cremation sites, which were close to the settlement so that the mother could call the souls back. He also states: "It is not permissible to cremate a child's body on the same wood as that used for an adult - i.e., the larch. The larch crackles while burning. The child's soul, afraid of the crackling, will run away and will never return to its mother to be reincarnated. Therefore, a child's body is cre- mated on t al rnik wood which burns quietly, with- out crackling" (1930a:99-100). The tree burial of infants was as follows: a coffin was made of two halves of a portion of a tree trunk, the body was placed inside and the two halves lashed together. The coffin was then taken into the forest and placed in the fork of a tree. It is not clear if the tree selected was on or near the lineage burial ground (Kreinovich, 1930a:99). Different rituals were followed in the case of twins, a man killed by a bear and a man who had drowned. As described in the section on twins in Nivkh world view, twins are considered to have a dual nature, human and divine, one twin having one aspect, the other another. But since twins in es- sence are a unity, in life both assume the nature of the human twin and in death the nature of the divine twin. As the mother of the twins is considered to be a "chosen vessel," elected to be a partner of a supernatural being, she too, after death, does not have the ordinary destiny of dead souls but joins her supernatural spouse. Consequently, twins and their mother are buried with rites intended to indicate their special status and divine associations. The ritual of twin burial is as follows: the body is placed in a sitting position, cross legged, and kept in place by means of a pole at the back. No costly prestige garments are used. The body is dressed only in a white shirt and white underpants and covered with the sacred wood shavings. It is then placed within an enclosure made of wood. The body of the mother of twins is interred in the same fashion, except that it is placed in a box and not in an en- closure (Shternberg, 1929:177). Near the grave site a special mortuary memorial raf for twins, tongs-raf, is erected. A double image, the two halves depict- ing human figures joined, is placed on the bed of sacred wood shavings. The board forming the bottom of the mortuary house is extended beyond the side wall and on this offerings are placed. There are two round openings, one in each side wall, one for each twin. Offerings of food are inserted through these openings. The roof rests on a beam, on which is carved the head of a bear. The wooden image may represent only one twin, if only one has died, or both. In that case the two images would be carved connected at body level, side by side. Inau are placed before the shrine. The memorial shrine itself is carved with designs on the outside, which Shtern- berg considered having special symbolic significance, even though he was not able to elicit their meaning. The stylized images of fish are incorporated into the design, and very evident is the sign reminiscent of Chinese yin/yang opposition.* *See illustrations in the appendix to Shternberg, 1929.</page><page sequence="74">74 Arctic Anthropology X-l Shternberg interpreted the significance of twin mortuary memorials as essentially different from that of the ordinary ones. He believed that while in cases of ordinary death the mortuary memorial was considered by the Nivkh as the abode of the soul, that of the twins had the function of a re- ligious shrine. In the first case, the memorial was neglected as soon as the official mourning period ended, which could be as little as three months. The mortuary memorial of twins, on the other hand, was venerated for three generations, that is, for the period believed to be necessary for souls to become dust through a process of repeated trans- formations. Yet even then they were not simply abandoned, as in ordinary cases. At the proper time, lineage kinsmen carried the little toy houses with their double images and the sacred wood shavings to the place in the forest where the lineage usually made annual offerings to the Master of the Mountain/Forest. They covered the little houses with shavings and a final festive meal with offer- ings to the deity took place. All worship and offer- ings at the mortuary memorials for twins, as well as appeals for their help in cases of grave illness, was done either at new or full moon. Death by violence occasioned by a supernat- ural agency also called for special rituals. No description could be found of special rites for the victims of death by fire or lightning, and it is as- sumed that they were possibly considered as being directly incorporated into the category of benevolent ancestors whose center was the hearth fire. Shtern- berg (1893:24-2 5) described the ritual followed in cases when a person was killed by a bear. The vengeance, reminiscent of the blood feud among the living, taken on the bear in such cases will be discussed elsewhere. Here only special funeral arrangements will be described. If the victim was killed in the woods, his body was brought into the village astride the carcass of the bear who had been killed by the victim's kinsmen. A wooden palisade was erected into which were placed both the carcass of the bear and the body of the victim. The palisade was closed and only openings for placement of offerings were left. Offerings were made in the beginning at frequent intervals , later once a year. At the third generation they ceased, after lineage kinsmen had sacrificed dogs at the source of their local river (1893:25). In another version, Shternberg reports that the bear was skinned and the body of the victim wrapped in the animal's skin. If the body of the victim had been consumed by the animal, a stylized wooden figure, either full length or torso, was sub- stituted. If the killer-bear (or his substitute) was not found, the body of the victim was covered with sacred wood shavings such as were used in funeral rites for all those who were considered to have been chosen by deities, and a wooden half image of the bear placed under the corpse. The enclosure in which the body reposed was decorated on the inside with inau and on the outside with four young trees marking the corners. A reversal of the normal bear ritual feast followed the interment, and during the night the enclosure was guarded by armed men, spears in hand, should the bear's lineage attempt vengeance. Those who stood guard reported that they distinctly heard the dead man cry "Here comes the bear!." and that they then attacked the invisible beast. In the morning one could see blood on the points of their spears (Shternberg, 1904b:III:82-83). The body of a drowning victim is cremated - although not in the lineage burial ground but on the sea or river shore as close as possible to the spot where the body was recovered. The boat used on the occasion of a drowning is never used again and a great offering is made to the Master of the Waters. Shternberg also states that new dwellings had to be made where the parents or one of the brothers of the victim took up residence (1933:308-309). From Shternberg 's notes cited above it appears that in cases of drowning the body was kept 'in the boat for the usual three-day wake. Near the boat were placed a Chinese kettle and a branch roughly the height of a man. Water was boiled in the kettle and the steam and the pole were supposed to shield the soul of the deceased from danger (1933:309). Shternberg also states that sometimes the cremation site was selected by chance: kinsmen rowed one boat while the boat with the body drifted and the site was determined when the boat containing the body drifted ashore (1933:339). Friends of the vic- tim, noted for their bravery, were selected to guard the body. One pronounced the incantation: "Kettle boil, steam rise, pole broaden, make a screen so that the devil won't find the Gilyak." At the same time, a shaman performed a divination ceremony in the dead man's dwelling to determine which sorcerer had caused the death. Usually, strange noises were heard by the guards. These noises were, of course, made by the spirit of the evil doer and it was at- tacked by the guards with harpoons used to hunt the dolphin. It was believed that the next day the evil sorcerer who had caused the death would have wounds on his body and soon die. On the third day the rite of cremation was performed. A new dish for offerings to the Master of the Waters was made on this occasion and so was a bowl intended for offerings to the dead man. Mosr was placed into one, red currants in the other. The vessels were preserved for two more summers, then destroyed. After that a "true" ritual dish was carved and offer- ings to the Master of the Waters in memory of the deceased were made in it. These offerings continued for three generations (Shrenk, 1903:111:140; Shtern- berg, 1933:309-309).</page><page sequence="75">Black: The Nivkh 75 Those dead by violence of men - victims of murder, casualties in war, suicides - also had special ritual observances which distinguished them from ordinary mortals. The dead in wars or murdered were believed to assume, at least for a time, the form of birds. They could find peace in the village of the dead only after vengeance had been taken. Their souls congregated in the form of birds of vengeance in flocks and were a constant danger to all kinsmen. Therefore, while the bodies of those slain in battle were brought home to the settlement for disposal, no body of a victim of violence was brought inside the dwelling. The wake was held outdoors. The bodies were cremated but instead of an ordinary raf, the mortuary memorial shrine, a tree stump was uprooted and placed on the grave site, roots up. The roots were carved in the shape of a bird in flight with human limbs (Shrenk, 1903:111:140-141; Shternberg, 1904:111:84-85). There is little information on the rites accom- panying funerals of suicides, but it appears that the bodies were cremated. XIV. THE SOCIETAL ORDER42 In the traditional Nivkh society the effective group was the agnatic lineage that functioned as an integrated whole, exercising control over the basic economic, political, societal and religious sub-systems. Lineages were linked with other units of the same order by a prescriptive matrilat- eral cross cousin marriage pattern. The Nivkh world view relfected the basic principles of Nivkh social order, with this order explicitly restated symbolically in their ritual. Dominating the entire social order was the principle of reciprocity ex- pressed as the exchange of unlike items. This ap- plied to all Nivkh relationships, not only between persons and groups, but also between human and non- human, including the transcendental orders of existence. On the human level it was assumed that the transacting parties were essentially equal, whereas in exchanges with transcendental powers their inequality was implicit (Shternberg, 1893:21). Our present knowledge of Nivkh social order rests primarily on the extensive data provided by Shternberg in almost a lifetime of research. Sub- sequent restudies, notably by Zolotarev and Kreino- vich, confirmed the basic outline drawn by Shtern- berg, adding significantly only to our knowledge of the details of social organization. Residence. As mentioned above in the discus- sion of the settlement pattern, membership in the agnatic lineage entitled every male to the usufruct in the lineage's territorial domain, which included fishing sites, sea mammal hunting sites, plant gathering sites and forest animal hunting grounds. Since agnatic ties guaranteed rights to the exploita- tion of territorial domain and consequently the eco- nomic subsistence, patrilocal residence was the rule. However, in reality residence was often a matter of individual choice and initiative. Affinal ties often played a role in the choice of residence, and common residence or sharing of territory may have been decided upon by agreement. New terri- tory may have been settled either by enterprising individuals or by those who, due to a grave trans- gression, lost rights of citizenship in their original group. In any given locality, the primacy of residence gave the founding lineage a slightly higher status, expressed in ritual terms, while the ideology af- firmed the equality of groups. The First Settlers, for example, were the first to make the offering at the seasonal rituals to the Master of the Waters (Kreinovich, 1936:716). The arrangement of dwell- ings, with newcomers having to build upstream from older settlers, also gave the First Settlers the most advantageous position economically, since Nivkh livelihood depended on the catch of salmon moving upstream at the spawning season (Kreinovich, 1936: 713; Taksami, 1961:106). Settlement of a new group in a given locality was formalized by contracting a marriage, with the old settlers giving a woman to the newcomers (Black, 1972). In addition to the customary bride gift, the newcomers reciprocated by "giving" to the older settlers a site they located but which was not previously hunted (Kreinovich, 1936:717). Economics. The Nivkh economic structure was essentially a subsistence type with a hunting and fishing base. Resources were distributed on the basis of the principle of equity and collective re- sponsibility within the effective kinship unit, the lineage. Reciprocal obligations governed relation- ships between the units, as expressed in the rules of unlimited hospitality and reciprocal gift giving. Within the lineage, the basic economic unit was the household, which may have contained an extended agnatic family with members of affinal groups or could have been limited to a nuclear family. Household composition in Nivkh society was first analyzed by Shternberg (1893:32-33; 1904b: 111:102). Within the household, each family formed an economic sub-unit. Normally, a household contained an adult man and his spouse or spouses; his children (minors of both sexes, unmarried daughters and married sons with their spouses and children); his brothers, mar- ried and unmarried; married brothers' spouses and children; unmarried sisters; his parents or a parent; his father's brothers, married and unmarried, their wives and children. Possible members of the house-</page><page sequence="76">76 Arctic Anthropology hold, for example, would also have been a man's father's brother's widow and her children, or his brother's widow and children. Within the dwelling, each family had its as- signed place. Taksami gives the rules for space allocation (1961:115-116, 130-132), positing that slight differences existed for the two types of dwelling. In the smaller semi- subterranean dwell- ing, to-ryv, the central bench, the place of honor, was occupied by the oldest male inhabitant and his family; the place of his sons and their families was located to the left of the entry. Other members of the household occupied the bench to the right of the entry. In the larger, Manchu-type chad ryv, the oldest member of the household and his family oc- cupied the bench left of the entry, with the youngest son and unmarried daughters of adult age also sharing this place. The oldest son occupied the back center bench. The least prestigious bench, at the wall which contained the door, was allocated to the brothers of the houseowner and the senior household member. Any space left over was oc- cupied by various relatives who might be co- resident in the household. Though each adult often pursued economic ac- tivities as an individual and, as will be discussed later, accumulated individual movable property, members of the household acted as an economic unit. Although food was cooked separately at the common hearth for each family (Shternberg, 1893: 33), household members were under obligation to share available resources, especially in case of need, and to render each other assistance in co- operative fishing enterprises. It should be noted that the obligation to share extended beyond the limits of the household to all agnates and to the lineages of wife-takers (Shternberg, 1904b:III:77, 114). These, in turn, were under obligation to ren- der assistance, often in form of labor, to the wife givers (Zolotarev, 1933:55, 57). Yet, each individual in the household, that is, each competent male, could and did engage in eco- nomic enterprises by himself, especially in the fur animal hunt. The latter was the sphere of economic activity in Nivkh life specifically viewed as an in- dividual matter (Shternberg, 1893:33). The distri- bution of the lineage domain, in which hunting rights were assigned to individuals or small lineage segments, supports this contention (Kreinovich, 1936:717-722, 733). It appears that seal hunting sites were strictly lineage domain, certain fishing sites may have been assigned to individuals within the lineage, and forest animal hunting sites, particu- larly sable streams and fox holes, were given over to' individuals. The rules appear to have incorporated some flexibility. For example, when sable hunting territory was insufficient to provide for all who had legal claim to it, brothers hunted the site in alter- nate years (Kreinovich, 1936:733). Territorial usu- fruct was validated by its exercise. If an individ- ual's use lapsed, another lineage member took over the site, but if the title holder returned, the site was vacated without dispute. The lineage domain was inalienable (Kreinovich, 1936:733, 734, 738, 739). Kreinovich notes that inter- lineage use of the economic domain occurred, but this always required the permission of the title-holders, be it to fish or to gather nettles; this type of interaction occurred primarily between affinally linked groups, but even distant agnates had to obtain permission of the resident core if they were located elsewhere. Part of the catch, even when permission was granted, was always left for the title holders. Even in cases when extensive fox hole territories were not used, whoever found litters of young foxes gave four out of five to the title holders (Kreinovich, 1936:733, 735). Property and Inheritance . Each adult could accumulate individual property, movable goods which were owned individually. Each person, with certain restrictions, could use and dispose of his accumulated movables as he saw fit. Into this category fell his boats, fishing gear, weapons, traps, sleds, skis, dogs, hunting gear, and above all the catch of his forest traps and the prestige goods obtained with it (Shternberg, 1893:35). Women's personal property consisted of their dowry, mostly valuable furs, and personal adornments. The rules of inheritance, in principle, were simple and unequivocal: no property could be alienated from the lineage, that is, inherited by a non-agnate. Male descendants in direct line had the first claim, and, failing sons, a man's brothers became his heirs, followed by more distant agnates in collateral lines (Shternberg, 1893:38). In practice, as Shternberg points out, the rules were bent or circumvented to adjust to the realities of life's de- mands. Often, a man's younger brother, presumably as a consequence of the rule of the levirate, had the first claim on the dwelling and gear. It is not clear if the younger brother had a claim to all mov- able possessions, but in reality, equitable distribu- tion in equal shares among the man's younger brother and his sons seems to have been the rule, with the youngest son given a slightly preferential treatment. If the deceased had no brothers, his sons inherited in equal shares, the youngest son getting the dwelling but a smaller share of the movables. Women, as a rule, were excluded from inheritance, as they were considered to have been incorporated at marriage into the lineage of their husbands.* *h married woman was buried in her husband's lineage burial ground.</page><page sequence="77">Black: The Nivkh 77 The exception was a woman's dowry, which she had brought with her from her natal lineage and which she was entitled to dispose of. It was a matter of pride for a father to provide his daughter with a rich dowry: valuable furs, metal, jade and glass beads and ornaments, richly embroidered robes and an assortment of intricately carved spoons, bowls and other household vessels. At the time of her departure from her natal home, the dowry was displayed; Shternberg reports that it was a favorite topic for local gossips (Shternberg, 1933:280). Normally, the woman's daughter in- herited this property, but the woman could will it to another. If she had no heir and failed to make a will, that is, a solemn declaration in the presence of the elders (Shternberg, 1893:39), it reverted to her natal lineage, specifically to her brother. Individual property, especially the class of prestige goods, the shagund, gave a man status in the community. Wealth opened the doors to social advancement and was measured by items, which, as Zolotarev described, were valued beyond mea- sure although of limited, if any, utility (1933:57). Shagund consisted of ceremonial weapons, metal kettles (especially tripods of Japanese workman- ship), Chinese tobacco pipes, bows and arrows, quivers, knives of fine workmanship (used in ritual and for special purposes), daggers, and Japanese swords. Pelts and fur of certain animals also be- longed to this category, lynx fur conferring the highest degree of prestige upon the owner. Traded Chinese silks and brocades, usually in bolts, but less often made into garments, also formed part of this wealth. Shagund accumulated through personal achievement: through successful trade which pre- supposed success in the hunt and fortune's favor. A man who was lucky enough to amass these coveted goods could spend them as he needed in certain contexts, perhaps to give a bride gift or confer a dowry on a daughter. When he died, his sons in- herited these riches although a part of them was inevitably destroyed at his funeral. Yet, even though the goods were acquired individually, were in theory individual property, and could even be disposed of by will, the shagund were not absolutely his. In case of lineage need, prestige goods could be claimed, and the owner was obliged to put these goods at the disposal of his agnates. Such a claim would be honored without dispute when a case of inter- lineage murder demanding blood price was settled by arbitration. All agnates contributed the payment as well as ceremonial rewards for the arbitrator. Shagund could also be claimed by the lineage to pay the debts of an agnate, especially if the debt was outstanding at the time of death. Shagund was also at the disposal of the lineage to obtain a wife for a poor lineage member whose fam- ily could not afford the bride gift. Thus in shagund it seems that the concepts of lineage property and individual property merged. In the rules governing the disposition of shagund by will, iron goods (weapons, kettles, etc.) could be willed to members of wife-taking lineages, since eventually these goods would return in form of bride gifts when the women of the lineage were married; fur goods could be willed to members of wife-giving lineages, for these goods would return when in- marrying women brought their dowries; silk goods could be willed only to agnates for use in funeral rites (Shternberg, 1904b:III:78; 1933:277-278). A wealthy man (an yz, "master") had the re- spect of his peers, for wealth accumulation was the result not only of one's skill, intelligence and shrewdness, but also of luck - the benevolence of Masters of wilderness domains and their intermedi- aries. Hence, the informal leadership roles in Nivkh society were open to an yz. Men spent a great deal of time and energy in pursuit of wealth. If successful, a man could be chosen to lead trading expeditions, to organize a seal hunt, to lead a war party or, if gifted with the ability to speak well and wisely, to arbitrate intra- and inter- lineage dis- putes. Only a rich man could afford to build a large sea-going boat and provide the needed equipment; only a successful hunter could become rich. A man whose relationships with the supernatural were in good order was assured of success in the hunt. Therefore, it was good to listen to the advice of a man whom fortune and the supernatural obviously favored. Good fortune, however, was given to an individual; it was not inheritable or transferable. A man's prestige died with him. Therefore, even with the massive intrusion of Russian and Japanese economic enterprises in the late 19th century, when individuals abandoned traditional occupations and life styles, becoming successful businessmen in the newly founded Russian centers or earning money as laborers in Russian settlements, no class strati- fication had developed at the time of the Soviet Revolution. In spite of the economic differentiation among individuals, as a rule they returned to their lineage settlements to enjoy the prestige and status of an yz, to participate once again in the traditional life by sharing and giving feasts in memory of de- ceased kinsmen, so as not to forfeit the good fortune granted by the deities and to find rest at death in the lineage burial ground. Slavery. Slavery existed in the traditional Nivkh society, though several ethnographers, notably Seeland and Taksami (himself a Nivkh) deny that this was so. Possession of slaves enhanced a man's status. It was the height of social climbing to in- clude slaves in one's daughter's dowry. Prior to the establishment of Russian rule, slaves were captured in raids on non-Nivkh groups or stolen,</page><page sequence="78">78 Arctic Anthropology X-l mostly from the Ainu, during trade expeditions. Apparently slaves were also bought, again primarily from the Ainu but also from the Chinese (Shtern- berg, 1933:300, 301), though some informants de- nied that slave purchase existed. Slaves could marry and in the fifth generation their descendants became free. This process was expressed in body terms: a slave's son became free to his eyes, his grandson became free to his neck, in the third gen- eration a slave's descendant became free to his waist, in the fourth to his knees, and, finally, in the fifth, his whole body was set at liberty (Shtern- berg, 1933:299; Zolotarev, 1933:59). Nivkh men did not marry slave women and allegedly no Nivkh woman ever married a slave. Slaves performed heavy household tasks, such as wood chopping, carrying water and helping women in the tremen- dous labor of dressing and preparing the fish catch for preservation. A slave, however, had definite rights. No Nivkh could murder a slave at will: murder of a slave was a sin of almost the same order as the murder of an agnate. In recent times some Nivkh lineages apparently were descendants of former slaves. Cooperative Labor. Cooperative labor played an important part in Nivkh life. Like much else in this society, it was governed by the rules of reci- procity, although some tasks were obligations, such as the cooperative building of a new dwelling and tasks performed by the wife takers for the wife givers. Fishing, especially with large seines, usually involved the cooperative efforts of house- hold males, sometimes including the entire village. The bear festival was a collective lineage responsi- bility, and all members contributed to the upkeep of the animal as well as to the food and other re- sources for the feast itself. Seal hunting was al- ways cooperative. However, seal hunts, like trading expeditions, were largely dependent on individual initiative and access to equipment and resources. These were not organized on the basis of kinship or residence, though often kinsmen and co-villagers participated. The reputation of the initiator deter- mined the mustering of the crew. Usually such a leader chose young men and hunters from other line- ages of pandf, the group of intermarrying lineages , possibly (as Shternberg believed) because daily social intercourse among agnates was subject to various and rather strict rules of avoidance. One of these prohibited conversations between male agnates; on an expedition that may have lasted a month or two, in the confinement of a boat at sea, such a situation would become irksome indeed. The duties of the organizer of the expedition and/or boat owner have been discussed partially in the section on seal hunting. The organizer usually took the helm of the boat. Occasionally, when a proven hunter advanced in age participated, the owner of the boat and initiator of the expedition held the helm, while the old man sat in the stern with him and took over the responsibility for ritual perform- ances. Absolute age determined the order in the boat, with the youngest and least experienced having his place in the bow. When the hunting ground was reached, however, the best shot from among the crew took the place in the bow. The catch, upon the hunters' return, was divided equally among all participants, even the great first-killed seal who nominally belonged to the leader of the expedition. If the owner of the boat had not par- ticipated in the actual hunt but only loaned the boat, he, too, was entitled to an equal share. The same rules of organization and catch division ap- plied to dolphin, white whale and other large marine animals (Kreinovich, 1934a). Bride Service. As a rule, p a ndf members co- operated in economic enterprises on request and rendered assistance without recompense. In a special category was bride service, which occurred occasionally, but only under special circumstances and was ranked very low in the Nivkh scale of values. The conditions under which bride service was acceptable were the extreme poverty of the groom's family and lack of male heirs in the bride's family. In the latter case, lacking young males for labor, the family was willing to accept a prospective son-in-law in their household, giving him their daughter as wife in exchange. He usually performed heavy and low status tasks normally avoided by Nivkh men. Bride service was decidedly a thing not to do. However, life being what it is, some men had to take it as it came, but they did not have to like it. Marriage Rules and Patterns. The lineage or- ganization also governed the Nivkh societal system, explicitly through the regulation of marriage. Line- ages were exogamous and bound in a system of inter-lineage alliances based on prescriptive matri- lateral cross-cousin marriage. Incest within an agnatic lineage was a deadly sin and so was inter- course with members of lineages which for any given individual fell in the prohibited class of mar- riage partners. The kinship terminology, of class if i - catory character, was recently described as being of Omaha type (Scheffler and Lounsbury, 1971:192- 198). Each lineage was linked with several others by affinal relationship and was either wife-taker (ymgi) or wife-giver (akhmalk ) to any given lineage in the alliance {pandf). Only one marriage between indi- viduals was necessary to establish the statutory affinal relationship; such marriages were the means for establishing new alliances and defining relation</page><page sequence="79">Black: The Nivkh 79 ships between groups. Once established, such re- lationships were seen as perpetual, and all lineages linked by affinal ties constituted a named unit {pandf) bound by a complex system of mutual obli- gations and reciprocal gift giving. Shternberg, when he first analyzed the pandf system (1904b:I: 21-42; 111:110-119), pointed out that these affinally linked lineages actually formed an endogamous unit with sub-units governed by exogamous rules (1904b: 1:3 5), in which the solidarity rests on (a) common descent of men; (b) common descent of women; and (c) on the principle that the relationship has to be renewed in each generation. Shternberg based his judgment specifically on the Nivkh terminology: khal, designating agnatic lineage, he glossed as "sheath" (1904b:III:66), while pa ndf was glossed as "of the same root" (1933:268). While each man by birth had, in theory, a right to a wife from the lineages of his wife-givers, and his sister had a right to a husband from lineages of the wife-takers, individual unions had to be vali- dated by contract, that is, by conclusion of indi- vidual marriages, often preceded by betrothal, and involving an exchange of bride gift (more rarely bride service) and dowry between contracting par- ties. While sexual access was permitted a man to all women who fell into the "marriageable" class, her housewifely services required a formal indi- vidual arrangement. Legally, a man could marry any woman who was classified as his mother's brother's daughter. However, the Nivkh distinguished be- tween marriages between class if icatory cross cousins and marriages between the offspring of real siblings. The latter marriages were considered pure and the exchange of gifts in such cases in- volved only objects of symbolic value of extremely high meaning load. That the Nivkh did not consider the exchange of goods for a woman a purchase, contrary to much literature, was pointed out by Shternberg: the word designating such goods was azr, "gift"; the Nivkh language also possessed words to designate such concepts as "price" or "fine" (Shternberg, 1933: 275). Shternberg's view is supported by the data, which clearly indicate that utilitarian objects were undesirable for the bride gift and only prestige goods should have been so used. As these goods were never utilized but only stored in lineage storage houses as signs of wealth, the symbolic value of the bride gift is underlined. Dowry, too, given by a good father to his daughter, consisted exclusively of prestige goods. However, the re- ciprocal gift exchange did not terminate with the wedding, but continued through life. The wife-taker, as pointed out previously, was not only obliged to exchange gifts, his being of slightly higher value than those of his wife-giver, but he also was obliged to render labor on demand. The wife- giver, on the other hand, was obligated to help his wife- taker in time of need, especially in times of scar- city. "A son-in-law must be fed" stated the Nivkh dictum (Shternberg, 1904b:III:lll; 1933:183). More- over, the Nivkh recognized more complex relation- ships between linked groups beyond the ones joined by immediate affinal ties. On the basis of affinal relationships, they extended to include wife-givers to their immediate wife-givers and wife-takers to their immediate wife-takers. These groups were called tujma akhmalk and tujma ymgi respectively. The rules governing the unidirectional flow of wo- men between groups applied to these "distant" wife- givers and wife-takers, but did not extend beyond this "second degree" relationship (Shternberg, 1904b: 1:36). Thus, a man's (or woman's) agnatic lineage membership regulated his or her future marriage as well as legal and economic rights. A man whose parentage could not be ascertained was a "man without a country": He had no hunting grounds, no relatives on whom he could call for assistance, and he could not marry. If a girl became pregnant and refused to name the child's father or, if named, it appeared that he was not of permissible category, the child was killed. It appears from a variety of sources that in Nivkh society the system was often at odds with individual inclinations. Though theo- retically each man had sexual rights and access to all women of his generation of the category anjey (MBD) there was, of course, the tendency to con- clude individual unions based on mutual attraction, to establish one's own household and enjoy the company and relationship of one's own spouse with- out interference from anyone, no matter what legal claims there were. There was evidence of greed, in which women were used to amass wealth by de- manding outrageously high bride gifts; there was the tendency on the part of the young men to avoid the labor and effort necessary to amass suitable wealth for the bride gift and instead acquire a wife by ab- duction. Finally, there were the personal factors. The records are replete with stories of forced mar- riages: partners disparate in age or without any personal tie or affection; of elopement, of suicide. The latter was institutionalized in the Nivkh world view and in the belief reflected in folklore that lovers who died together in a suicide would in the next world be able to be united in matrimony. Poly- gyny was an ideal, with men competing for the sake of prestige and standing in the community to acquire more than one wife. At times the first wife urged her husband to take another - to share her heavy household tasks and to enhance the standing of the household. Often, sisters were married to the same man and in the Nivkh ideology the s ororate was considered a commendable practice. The custom gave the first wife a slight edge; in ritual matters, when reouired. she assisted her husband and. in</page><page sequence="80">80 Arctic Anthropology X-l general, unless she was childless, she ruled the household. Simultaneously, by the rules of mar- riage and classificatory kinship terminology, poly- andry occurred. Actual reported cases of polyandry all deal with the fraternal type. Even in cases of fraternal polyandry, individual conflicts over women flared up, especially if one, usually the younger brother, was tactless in the exercise of his rights. Fratricide is documented in literature and led to lineage fission, but contrary cases of harmonious polyandrous household are reported by Shternberg. Whether the household was polygynous or polyan- drous, there was ample room for interpersonal ten- sions. Shternberg, for example, records a case in which a woman had her hair cut and then was burned alive in the funeral pyre when a diviner accused her of causing the death of a child by another wife (1933:337). The levirate was widely practiced and formal- ized in Nivkh society, though there appears to have been some variation in the rules between dif- ferent localized groups. While among some groups any brother could become the husband of a deceased brother's widow, most Nivkh adhered to the rule that only the younger agnates had this right. The terminological distinction between younger and older siblings seems to indicate that the latter was the rule. Often, elders of the lineage, weighing social and economic factors, assigned a widow and her children to a younger agnate. Once such a de- cision was made, the assignee could not refuse to take the woman in. In real life, the levirate appar- ently was a source of friction and intra- lineage dis- putes. Divorce was possible and apparently simple; it involved at least partial return of the bride gift. Unfortunately, divorce proceedings have not been described specifically in any sources on hand. The main cause of divorce was infecundity and, much more rarely, mistreatment of the woman by her husband. If a wife deserted her husband, all his agnates theoretically had to aid him in his efforts to reclaim the runaway. This could take the form of an armed raid or simply involve moral support in endless negotiations with the woman's natal group, with perhaps additional demands for bride gift, the father of the woman claiming that the husband had not fulfilled all his financial obligations, or, if the husband thought himself well rid of the woman, the negotiations would deal with return of the bride gift in toto or in part. Cases such as the latter were rare, and Nivkh custom acknowledged the legality of such a demand only if a girl betrothed in childhood died before cohabitation took place, or if the woman was childless; more seldom, when di- vorce was mutually agreed upon. If the woman eloped with a lover, all lineage members participated in retaliatory raids on the village of the abductor. These often ended in wholesale slaughter so that entire villages, or line- age segments, were wiped out. Theoretically, all agnates were obliged to join a husband or a father in pursuit and seizure of the runaway and in the punishment of the abductor. In real life, only those agnates co- resident with the injured kinsman par- ticipated. It appears that the Nivkh attempted to avoid bloodshed if the involved party belonged to a lineage with whom the injured lineage stood in statutory affinal relationship. Where no such formal relationship existed, bloodshed was the rule rather than exception. Individual marriages were accompanied by a certain pomp and circumstance though the actual marriage rite was exceedingly simple. Marriages were often contracted by parents while the parties were still children, often even before they were born. Betrothal was a contract, legally binding, and not ever broken lightly. The Nivkh called the betrothal by a term which Shternberg glosses as "agreement about the bride," the groom to be as "future hus- band" and his fiancee as "future wife." The agree- ment was made through an intermediary, called "man who makes the agreement" in the presence of agnates of both sides (Shternberg, 1933:270). In cases of the "pure" marriage, that is the marriage between real MBD and FZS, the betrothal had a special name (tkhagund), and the procedure was entirely different, confined almost exclusively to ritual action.* The participants in the betrothal negotiations on the bridegroom's side were his father, mother, father's brother, brother and father's sister's hus- band. If the groom's father was dead, his place was taken by urdla nivukh - one of the most sub- stantial members of the lineage, an yz among the y z - that is, a recognized man of wisdom among the wealthiest and most respected members of the com- munity. Other respected lineage members could also be present (Shternberg, 1933:271). The groom himself either could be present or not. He engaged in negotiations himself if he was poor, but that was really not the proper thing to do. The delegation never arrived at the bride's house on foot even if they came from next door. They came in sleds or boats, laden with gifts consisting of prestige goods only. The bride's side was represented by her parents and lineage members of standing. Her brothers were present, as was the girl herself, but her role was passive. She was expected to sit quietly and si- lently among the boxes containing her dowry and * See sections on world view and lineage rit- ual, sub- section on dogs.</page><page sequence="81">Black: The Nivkh 81 indicate her consent when called to do so. Ac- tually, all possible outcomes could come to pass. A loving father could refuse to give away his daughter against her will; another, greedy for the bridegift, would force her into an unwanted mar- riage; still another might judge the marriage un- suitable and tactfully try to avoid giving his con- sent. Another complication might arise if the bride- groom's party claimed that the father had given his consent previously, even if the man was not aware that he had done so, a victim of a ruse. In such cases, the father usually gave in, as violation of the betrothal promise was considered a sin. Elaborate etiquette was followed at all stages of the proceedings. It was considered extremely rude to broach the matter directly and a great deal of circumlocution was employed. It was incumbent upon the bride's father to misunderstand the pur- pose of the visit, to feign surprise and, when the matter was finally brought into the open, to play down his daughter's virtues. He might claim that his daughter were ugly, stupid, a poor housewife - and it behooved the groom's party to deny such statements and say: "We are not after beauty, and as far as housewifely expertise goes, she is young yet, she will learn. . ." (Shternberg, 1933:273). After the basic understanding was reached, the parties proceeded to define the terms: the size of the bride gift. It was improper to arrive at terms quickly and the haggling could continue for the en- tire day or more. Once the amount was agreed upon, and the bridegroom knew if he should deliver the entire wealth at once or in installments, he could claim the woman. If the installment payment had been stipulated the man claimed the woman upon delivery of the first installment, as no Nivkh was expected to renege on the delivery of the agreed bride gift. Failure to comply would prompt blood feuds to the third generation. Installment delivery of the bride gift and "promissory notes" were com- mon. Shternberg reports how a Nivkh married a girl whose only male relative at the time was a child. He did not give any gift then but promised his minor "father-in-law" the gifts he would even- tually obtain for a daughter. When his akhmalk was a young man and ready to marry, his ymgi ful- filled the promise to the letter (Shternberg, 1933: 279). Shternberg reports a curious complication in the distribution of the bride gift. A lineage receiving bride gifts for its daughters will sometimes assign part of this wealth to their own wife givers, but only if the relationship is of long standing. If such an arrangement obtains , the groom delivers part of the bride gift to his tujma akhmalk , the distant wife-givers, directly. The receiver is usually the girl's mother's brother; in rare cases, when the girl's mother's father is alive, the latter (1933:279). Another custom, in my opinion an indication of the subordinate status of the wife-takers to the wife-givers, is the practice when a man gives his minor sister to his mother's brother or his young daughter to his wife's brother whom these persons then marry off and receive bride gifts for them. If the wife had several brothers, the practice demanded that each should be given a girl for this purpose (Shternberg, 1933:279).* In such cases no share of the bride gift went to the girls' father or her brothers. This practice was considered very virtuous and had to be voluntary on the part of the girl's agnates (Shternberg, 1933:279). Many authors, including Shternberg, have stated that Nivkh marriage takes place without ceremony, as girls betrothed at a very young age enter the households of their husbands long before marriage is consummated. With further study, how- ever, Shternberg modified his opinion and reported that the Nivkh indeed had a marriage ceremony and its symbolic value was high, as elements of it were paralleling certain elements of the bear ritual (Shternberg, 1933:267-270). Shternberg distinguished the "orthodox" form of marriage ritual and the " non- orthodox. " The first was the union of real cross cousins and the pro- ceedings were highly ritualized, with the father's fathers of the children being betrothed participating. "The groom's father brings a male dog, and the groom's mother spins out of nettles and this dog's hair two threads; with one thread she binds the hand of the girl, with the other the groom's father binds the little hand of his son. All this happens in the presence of the eldest members of the lineage and the marriage is considered indissoluble" (Shternberg, 1933:269). When marriage took place not between real but class if icatory cross cousins, the "unorthodox" mar- riage in Shternberg 's terms, the ceremony was quite different but not less symbolic. Such marriages were preceded by the betrothal described above. Immediate claim to the girl was rare and unseemly, and happened most often when the parties were poor. But even in these cases a common meal and sharing of a smoke (pipe) and a feast for relatives, no matter how small, took place (Shternberg, 1933: 281). He wrote: "Among the rich families imme- diate departure of the claimed bride occurred only if the groom lived very far away, or the marriage was considered very advantageous, either because of *Levi-Strauss' implication that the girls were given to akhmalk as wives (1969:304) and much of his interpretation of Shternberg 's Nivkh data on pp. 302-305 as well as his reading of Shternberg 's explanation of the phenomenon is either incorrect and/or open to criticism.</page><page sequence="82">82 Arctic Anthropology X-l the girl's family standing or because of her own outstanding reputation, and the groom was afraid to delay for fear that a wealthier or more desirable candidate may cause the breach of agreement" (1933:281). In most cases the day of the wedding was set in the course of betrothal negotiations - the last but not the least important point to be settled (Shtemberg, 1933:281). On the appointed day the groom, accompanied by his parents and important agnates arrived either by sled or boat. The objects given as bride gift and the dowry were publicly displayed outside the bride's house. The girl's relatives prepared a fes- tive meal for guests, members of the two lineages. The girl herself was surrounded by the female mem- bers of her household and other girls of her own lineage. These consoled her about the imminent break with her home and gave advice as to future conduct.* When the meal was served, the bridal pair sat next to each other but were forbidden to converse while they ate from the same dish and smoked from the same pipe. In the evening the mother of the bride directed the groom to go to. the sleeping place of her daughter and the marriage was consummated in the bride's home. The next morning, the bride served her husband the morning meal and formally addressed him as husband. The departure for the groom's village took place im- mediately thereafter, following a customary farewell meal during which parents of the couple pronounced ritual prayers calling for the blessing of the union. The final rite was called "stepping on the kettle" or "stepping on the threshold." It involved a large tripod kettle, part of the bride gift, which was placed inside, and a smaller kettle, belonging to the bride's father, placed just outside the threshold. The newlyweds, bride first, put one foot into each kettle; they were not supposed to touch the thresh- old when leaving her natal home. They took the smaller kettle, the property of the bride's father, with them. This ceremony was repeated a year later when the couple returned for a customary first visit, usually with their first child (Shtemberg, 1933:281-283). Often, in spite of the best intentions of all concerned, it happened that such arranged marriages were not looked upon with favor by the young man and woman involved. Abduction was a course fre- quently chosen to circumvent the rules. If the man was of marriageable category and the girl was single, consequences were slight. Usually, the marriage was formalized by exchange of gifts. If, however, a woman who was married or a betrothed girl was abducted, the matter became ugly. Kreino- # The rule of post- marital residence was, of course, patrilocal. vich's vivid description of the punishment meted out to a wife who deserted her husband for just cause to return to her father has been cited. The punishment was not unusual. If a married woman eloped with a lover and her legal husband caught up with them, the lover's fate, unless he was an agnate, was death on sight. Shtemberg in all his works cites cases of forcible abduction, elopement, forcible return of women, recourse to baptism under Russian administration to avoid the marriage system rules, and suicide on the part of the women when the marital situation became intolerable (Shtemberg, 1933:283, 284). On the other hand, warm interpersonal relation- ships often existed between spouses and cases of suicide by one partner following the death of another are reported. Avoidance Rules. Shtemberg believed, and the ethnographic evidence seems to strongly support his views , that the system of marriage was condu- cive to the creation of extreme interpersonal ten- sions and that a mechanism of tension reduction were the elaborate rules of avoidance (1933:186-190). In the following presentation, I follow Shtemberg 's analysis of these rules. They operated on two levels: (a) between lineage and generation mem- bers of the same sex and (b) between persons of different sexes between whom sexual relationships were prohibited. The Nivkh recognized four types of avoidance of different degrees of severity. Indynd was the prohibition of looking at a per- son and was operative between brothers and sisters, real and classificatory, extending to children of sisters married into different lineages; khernd was the prohibition of engaging in conversation of any kind. This prohibition applied to agnates of the same sex, mostly to males, brothers real and clas- sificatory. The rule, apparently, was not applied with extreme rigor. Chats and general conversation were forbidden absolutely, business conversations were permissible when absolutely necessary (1933: 188-189); vakrund was the prohibition of scolding. Lerund was the prohibition of joking, teasing, play- ing and applied in various degrees of stringency to members of opposite sexes in the same household. A father could never joke with his daughter, but he could engage in conversation and he could scold. Between persons with whom any sexual expression was prohibited, all forms of avoidance applied. All men who were pu (husbands) to the class of women anjey (wives), and all women of this class, had to observe the rules of khernd among themselves and, naturally, of vakrund. Brothers could engage only in a minimum of conversation necessitated by com- mon household and economic enterprises and needs. The same rules applied between HM, HF, and SW, a man and his BW, if he was the older brother. But</page><page sequence="83">Black: The Nivkh S3 even this minimum of communication had to pass through an intermediary. Direct address was pro- hibited except in dire need and a person whose status in the kinship system permitted verbal inter- course served as the conductor. Shternberg saw these rules as the reason for the composition of trading and hunting parties of groups of affines and for the absence in the Nivkh language of forms ex- pressing greetings and farewell. Children were trained from the youngest age to observe the avoidance rules. A breach was con- sidered a grave sin likely to bring misfortune to the entire lineage alliance. Political Organization and Leadership. The political structure of the Nivkh was acephalous and egalitarian, governed by the principle of lineage solidarity and respect for age (Zolotarev, 1933:58; Shternberg, 1893:15-16). Lineage members bore collective responsibility for breaches of custom and law committed by individuals. The obligation of collective responsibility ranged from vengeance in cases of murder to payment of debts and of as- sorted fines for theft or loss. The agnatic lineage, which in Nivkh ideology was perpetual and infinite, in reality appears to have been shallow; segmentation apparently was common. Shternberg found persons dispersed throughout Sakhalin and the Amur region who traced their descent to a single lineage. The fluidity of Nivkh settlements and their smallness as well argue for the essential instability of the agnatic unit extending beyond the three generation span. This inference is supported by Nivkh kinship nomen- clature which made discriminations within four gen- erations1 span: ego's own, two ascending and one descending. Obligations of blood feud, payment of debt, ritual observances for dead twins, persons killed by bears and drowning victims, all extended for a period of three generations and ceased there- after.* The question of numerical strength was of great concern to Nivkh groups. This can be deduced from the existence of a formal adoption procedure and its reported frequency, and from the institution of lineage fusion. Both practices were formally recognized and validated in lineage ritual. Leadership among the Nivkh, as has been al- ready made clear, was informal and personal. They had no chiefs - their language did not contain a word to denote such a status - and while elders were respected, listened to, especially in ritual matters, and their advice often followed, they had no executive power. Decisions were made in in- formal deliberations of all males, with the greatest weight given to the opinions of the substantial citizens, the yz, who by their personal ability and success had achieved wealth. However, the old men, called khal geimar, the "lineage gray heads," rendered rulings and interpretations when there was doubt in a question of law and custom. These elders were usually the oldest living competent males of good character. Their position was re- spected but purely advisory. The position of the war leader, khimu nivukh, is least articulated in ethnographic literature. As there was a named status (Shternberg, 1933:303), it is feasible to assume that he had defined duties, and I believe that his identity was known. It seems that he simply assumed his duties in case of need and was called forward to lead the group to war. Shternberg writes: The greatest calamity has occurred: a kins- man has been killed ! War is unavoidable ! . . . The entire population gets under arms. There is no permanent chief, there is no elder, there is no election. The natural chief is long since known and recognized by all: he is the bravest and luckiest of all the kinsmen; this is the so-called mas- ter, yz, and to him all look now! In one moment, equal among equals, he suddenly becomes the military commander, gives orders, distributes weapons, decides on the time of the expedition etc. - and he is obeyed like a dictator. If he dies or is killed, this natural chief, everyone knows the most eligible successor to his office (1904b: 111:106). Social Control and Dispute Settlement. Offenses against individuals were offenses against the line- age. In this class were transgressions connected with lineage worship and particularly offenses con- nected with hearth and fire. In Nivkh idiom, the unity of the lineage was expressed by the words: But, we have one (i.e. common) akhmalk (father-in-law), one ymgi (son-in-law), one fire, mountain man, sea man, heavenly man, earthly man etc. - we have in common, the bear is one, the devil is one, tkhusind (fine) is one, sin is one (Shternberg, 1904b: 111:67). According to Shternberg 's analysis, which follows the above citation, "one sin" referred to the con- cept that all lineage members had the same religious observances and taboos; "one devil" referred to the concept that the sources of misfortune were the same for all lineage members, as, for example, the *It is difficult to judge if the Nivkh had the segmentary political system. This specific problem has not been investigated to my knowledge.</page><page sequence="84">84 Arctic Anthropology X-l spirit of'an unavenged kinsman or an injured strang- er. The reference to "one" or "common" Man of the four elements is connected with the concept that through the deceased members kinship links were established for each lineage with the supernaturals; moreover, the bear, as will be shown in the section on ritual, was strongly associated in Nivkh thought with, and symbolized, benevolent ancestors. The most serious crime in Nivkh society was murder. All violent death by human hand fell into this class. Manslaughter, whether premeditated or not, was immaterial to the immediate fact of vi- olent death. Inter- lineage death of this kind called for immediate vengeance. No kinsman of the victim to the third generation could avoid this duty; failure to perform it resulted in misfortune for the whole lineage. Vengeance was exacted only on male members of the offender's lineage, regardless of age. Women, therefore, reportedly attempted to conceal the sex of their offspring in order to protect infant boys from death at the hands of a raiding party (Shternberg, 1893:11). Within the lineage, murder was a sin of such enormity that normal sanctions became inoperative. The offender lost his rights in the group and had to leave. "The fire was broken" (Shternberg, 1933:282). Shternberg called this a "political death" (1904b:III:81). He also reports that occasionally near agnates pun- ished the murderer even in cases of intra- lineage death, but apparently only if the offender belonged to a distant collateral branch. Sometimes, MB avenged the victim in cases of intra- lineage mur- der (Shternberg, 1893:13). The unity of the lineage was expressed in terms of the "one bone." Ven- geance was referred to as "lifting the bones." Un- premeditated, accidental killing within a lineage apparently could be ignored (Shternberg, 1893:13). The concept of murder was extended to cases when it was believed that a person was knowingly and maliciously driven to suicide. In such cases ven- geance took the form of blood price demand and damage to the property of the guilty party (Shtern- berg, 1893:13). Inter- lineage conflict was considered by the Nivkh as war. As mentioned above, however, the rules of vengeance prohibited killing of women. Shternberg believed that women acted often as medi- ating agents between warring lineages and that they often formed a screen around the village watching out for any raiding party (1904b:III:86). As a rule, the immediate cause of a conflict was a dispute over women, most often a case of abduction. Ab- duction, however, was not always a crime or a cause for an "international" clash. At times, the abduction was mere fiction, an event connived at by all parties concerned, including the girl's parents. This happened presumably in cases where the mar- riage was thought desirable but, for one reason or another, a suitable bride gift could not be accumu- lated. Pursuit took place, but strictly in a cursory fashion. On the other hand, under different circum- stances, abduction was a very grave matter indeed. If the abductor was a stranger, he was killed on the spot if overtaken. His lineage, in such a case, was obliged to retaliate, and tensions between lineages linked by bonds of mutual obligation often became intolerable. All was made ready for armed conflict. Women and children were quartered in separate dwellings since by custom they could not be killed by the invaders. According to Shternberg, Nivkh dwellings had secret exits for escape (1893: 14). Men, armed to the teeth, congregated in another dwelling. It was against the rules to de- stroy enemy property (Shternberg, 1893:13-14). The tactics were sudden raid and counter- ambush. If the battle was joined, it had to be at night; it lasted a set time. Shternberg 's informants disagreed on the length of the statutory battle period. Some re- ported that one night of fighting was the limit. The war ended when casualties on both sides evened up, but even if the attacking party suffered greater losses than the defenders, it was considered that satisfaction had been obtained. Sometimes, the Nivkh joined battle at sea. Here bow and arrow were the weapons and boats were equipped with a shield that could be raised as a protective device (1893:14). Peaceful settlement of dispute, however, was by no means excluded, even in cases of murder. In spite of the absence of defined leadership positions, the Nivkh had developed an extremely sophisticated system of arbitration and adjudication. Each line- age acknowledged an individual who may be de- scribed as the lineage arbitrator or negotiator (khlai nivukh, literally "lineage man"). These in- dividuals were recognized by their peers as men of achievement and good fortune, wise counsel, and, foremost, as persuasive speakers. Their native name was glossed by Shternberg as "speaker," "orator," "spokesman." The symbol of their office was a wooden staff on which was carved a human head (Shternberg, 1904b:III:91). When a conflict between lineages involved a blood feud, each of the lineages in the dispute called in a khlai nivukh from a neutral lineage if the parties desired to avoid bloodshed. In disputes of lesser importance, khlai nivukh of the involved lineages in company with respected elders and other members of the community met and discussed the case; within a lineage, the disputes were settled by the most respected men and their own khlai nivukh. In cases of disagreement, he rendered a judgment which was considered binding. Tkhusind was the Nivkh designation for pay- ment of the negotiated fine in cases of murder, but the word had a wider meaning covering all fines</page><page sequence="85">Black: The Nivkh 85 paid in transgressions which in the Nivkh world view fell in the category of "sin" or "blasphemy," and for which the entire lineage was held account- able (Shternberg, 1904b:III:80). Shternberg reported that negotiations in a dis- pute settlement often varied according to circum- stances and the parties involved, but gave the following account as typical in cases of murder (1904b: III: 84-95): Usually, the identity of the khlai nivukh whose assistance was asked was well known in advance; some individuals were famed throughout the land as arbitrators, and, naturally enough, their services were in demand. Each lineage having selected a neutral representative, they proceeded to equip him for the task ahead. For the occasion, he was given costly Chinese silk and brocade robes with match- ing hat; a bow and arrow with a quiver of the best workmanship and quality; a ceremonial spear, and often a Japanese sword. So equipped, the khlai nivukh joined an armed party whom he represented. The injured party moved toward the ground of the offenders. There they camped in the wilderness, either on the bank of a river or in the forest. The arbitrator alone proceeded into the enemy settle- ment where he was met by the armed offenders headed by their neutral representative. The am- bassador of the injured party lit his pipe and an- nounced the demanded conditions of the settlement, that is the size and quality of the blood fine, which had to be commensurate with the victim's standing in the community. It was the negotiator's duty to get as high a settlement as the traffic would bear, while the duty of his opposite number was to re- duce the demands by skillful haggling to the barest possible minimum. The haggling began in verbal altercation; then the outsider would leave in feigned indignation, only to be followed by the other negotiator and begged to return. This some- times lasted for several days. When the amount of compensation was finally agreed upon, men of both parties, with negotiators in their midst, advanced to a meeting ground. Both parties were armed and the actual murderer took his place next to his negotiator, while the nearest agnates of the victim flanked theirs. The closest agnatic kinsman of the victim personified the latter and carried a spear and a drawn bow. In the Nivkh code of ethics it is forbidden to attack an unarmed person or to strike an unresisting one (Shternberg, 1933:180). There- fore, the murderer also carried the same armament as the avenger. Unarmed submission or non-resist- ance were equally against the Nivkh sense of right and wrong. According to Shternberg, negotiations were known to break down at this point, when feel- ings ran high and tension mounted. He reports that sometimes the avenger, forgetting the object of the meeting, lost his temper and loosened the arrow - and seldom missed. If this happened, the feud was considered over and both parties fell into each others arms to signify the advent of peace. A com- mon feast ended the proceedings. In another vari- ant, the murderer and the avenger faced each other with spears touching each other's breast while the khlai nivukh on both sides exhorted them to peace and to forget their grievance. Each side brought a dog and the animals were killed with spears, their hearts left on the ground to satisfy the Bird of Ven- geance that hovers over the lineage of an unavenged murder victim. The meat was consumed in a recon- ciliation feast (Shternberg, 1893:11-13; 1933:105; Kreinovich, 1930b:44). Negotiations over, the ar- bitrators received for their services the costly robes and weapons with which they were outfitted for the performance of their office as well as a choice dog. Khlai nivukh of each lineage who acted in intra- lineage disputes were chosen by consensus. Dis- putes were generally settled by an informal gather- ing of agnates or co-villagers, members admitted to the meeting by unspoken consent on the basis of their personal standing. Even old women known for their good sense were occasionally listened to. This was the mechanism for the settlement of lesser matters in the Nivkh scale of values, for many of which the fines were set by custom. For example, if a wife-taker struck his wife-giver, his wife's brother, he had to pay as fine a team of sled dogs; he had to deliver the team in person or, excep- tionally, through a respected intermediary. The offended party was under obligation to accept the reconciliation gift unless the dogs offered were of poor quality. If the offense went the other way, that is if a wife- giver struck his wife- taker, in token of reconciliation he was obliged to give a silk robe or to give a bear to his "son-in-law" (Shternberg, 1933:302). Squabbles over women within a lineage were settled on the merits of each individual case, and fines were set by the assembly. When theft was involved, the judicial procedure was based on divination. Divination was a gift that could not be learned. To attempt divination without possession of the gift was a sin. Each lineage had a specialist diviner and also an animal, parts of whose body were the instrument of divination. Tra- ditionally, these were the dried tendons of the ani- mal's hind legs. These animals, apparently, were lineage specific: one lineage for example had the wolf as its divination animal. Accidental loss was classed as theft perpetrated by means of supernatural manipulation. The iden- tity of the thief in either case, actual theft or loss, was established when the diviner heated the tendon over a fire made on the bank of a river in solemn assembly, usually in the presence of both the ac- cused and the accuser. As the tendon twitched in</page><page sequence="86">86 Arctic Anthropology X-l the flames, it was believed that the thief, whether present or absent, would also twitch. To get re- lief he would immediately confess his crime. If theft accusations involved two groups, the assem- bly in such cases was led by the leaders of war parties, khimu nivukh, who carried ceremonial spears as symbols of their office and acted as spokesmen for the groups of contestants. The parties were ranged opposite each other across the fire and the proceedings began by disputation, that is accusation, denial, and counter accusation. If no agreement was reached, the diviner performed his office. At this time, as the identity of the guilty was determined, two animals were sacrificed. The data are not clear as to who provided the ani- mals: each group one, possibly the animal asso- ciated with the lineage, or the group judged guilty providing both. In any case, in the example cited by Shternberg, a cat and a crow were burned alive while a set formula was recited: "You suffer for an imaginary deed to serve as an example what evil befalls those who sin and break the law" (Shtern- berg, 1933:303-304). When guilt was established, compensation was agreed on. If the thief confessed, this was usually as much as the injured demanded. If the thief and his lineage were too poor to pay compensation, they were obliged to provide the in- jured group with a woman, provided the lineages did not stand in a relationship which precluded marriage and sexual intercourse. In cases of loss defined as theft by means of evil spirits, a human image was used, made of a rotten stump with the head covered by a dolphin's bladder. The tendon used as the instrument of divination was tied around the figurine's neck. In the course of the night the figurine was carried through the settlement, stopping at each dwelling. The diviner then touched a house corner with the figurine saying "Look for your master" and pulled on the tendon. It was believed that when the fig- urine was brought to the dwelling of the guilty, he would begin to choke and this would cause him to confess. It was believed that death would follow otherwise (Shternberg, 1933:304-305). When the two parties to a dispute offered con- flicting testimony, divination was also resorted to. In such cases a special hut was constructed of branches and poles and there the lineage orator, khlai nivukh , took his seat in the capacity of adjudi- cator. Nothing could be cooked in this hut. It was marked as the place of judgment by a staff about one yard in length in which was carved a stylized human head (Shternberg, 1933:305) apparently sim- ilar to the staff carried by the khlai nivukh as his symbol of office. XV. LINEAGE RITUAL SYSTEM Nivkh ideology demanded that individuals maintain a relationship with the transcendental by means of rituals designed to cover every conceiv- able contingency of human need. In addition, the societal order, based as we have seen on the prin- ciple of the unity of the agnatic lineage and the permanence of marital alliances, was reflected and maintained through lineage ritual. Within the essentially unitary world view of the Nivkh were basic dichotomies: the living ver- sus the dead and the domestic versus the wild, each expressed in tripartite schema along the ver- tical and horizontal axis. The vertical axis at its extremes, in the world of the above and the below, had apparently a connotation of danger if not malev- olence. The middle world, centered around the living and the benevolent ancestors (who related to the living along the horizontal axis in mediated opposition to the wild and the domestic), was the main arena of the Nivkh lineage ritual in which the interpenetration of the social and ritual systems clearly became evident. Participation in the lineage ritual was deter- mined by kinship status; the ritual itself was cen- tered around a sacrificial act.* This act was ex- tremely complex in character, and involved three animals: the dog, representing the world of the living; and either the bear or the killer whale, each of which stood for a benevolent ancestor. Each was able to mediate and act as intercessor with the Master of the domain to which it belonged; at the same time, each had something of the nature of the Master within it. The bear festival, frequently mentioned in the literature, was the final act in the long cycle of funerary ceremonies; it signalled the restoration of order that had been disturbed by death. The bears served such ritual purposes either when captured and kept in the village for a time or killed in the forest. There are indications that rites associated with the killer whale had the same function and possibly the same structure as the bear festival. *Fire and hearth, symbols of the domestic sphere, and the rituals associated with them have already been discussed in detail above as were the seasonal "feedings" of the Masters of the Elements. Sacrificial acts in contingency situations will be dealt with in detail in the section on dogs imme- diately below and have been mentioned briefly in discussing aspects of the Nivkh social, economic and political systems.</page><page sequence="87">Black: The Nivkh 87 The rites involving the killer whale were held when the animal was washed ashore. In the case of the bear festival and possibly in like manner in rites associated with the killer whale, dogs were sacri- ficed. It appears that in the case of the bear festi- val the dog sacrifice, the final act in the rite, was the most important.* The role of the dog in Nivkh life and its significance in ritual context will be discussed at this point. The Dog.44 The dog was the only domestic ani- mal in Nivkh culture; though they have been in contact with reindeer breeding Orok, and through contact with Manchu and the Chinese knew of the cat** and other domestic animals, including horses and cattle, the Nivkh showed no interest in these creatures until the tremendous impact of Russian settlement and the area's subsequent development caused basic economic changes, altering their en- tire life.t The Nivkh used the dog as their primary means of winter transportation and beast of burden; in summer dogs were used to pull boats against the current (Kreinovich, 1930b:36); dogs were the pri- mary source of garment material; dog meat consti- tuted part of the Nivkh diet; dogs facilitated sani- tation by removing excrement in settlement areas; and last, but most important, dogs had great re- ligious significance. Even Shrenk, who always in- clined toward utilitarian and ecological explanations of phenomena, conceded that dogs were slaughtered and their meat eaten only in ritual contexts (1899: 11:124). The dog was also an important status symbol. In addition to a barnful of prestige goods, a man's worth was measured by the number and quality of his dog teams (Kreinovich, 1930b:39). Yet their im- portance far exceeded the purely material. The dog was a powerful symbol, within itself holding a mul- tiplicity of meanings that were often in turn multi- faceted. In the mundane sense, the Nivkh dog appears to have been an unprepossessing animal, though " Shrenk reported that he was tactfully made to leave before the last act of the bear festival at which he was an invited guest took place. Hence, his description of the rites lacks the description of the dog sacrifice (1903:111:64-103). ^Shrenk reported that cats were kept occa- sionally as pets either in cages or on chains (1883: 1:220, footnote 4). TTaksami, 1967:59; Smolyak, 1960:111-115, esp. p. 114. there is some disagreement on this point. Shrenk felt that Nivkh dogs belonged to the general, un- determined breed that spread over sub-arctic Si- beria: "longhaired, with pointed ears, resembling a wolf, they come in all possible colors: black, white, red like foxes, grey and spotted, but, most often, similar to the wolf, grayish yellow" (1899: 11:167). He considered the Nivkh dog to have been of smaller stature compared with, for example, Kamchatka dogs. He considered the Nivkh very negligent in selective breeding as they failed to choose for survival the biggest and the strongest in any litter. His opinion of Nivkh care of adult dogs, especially the females, was very low: while sled dogs were fed regularly he thought that the fe- males had to shift for themselves: "emaciated and hungry, they wander around the houses and outside throwing themselves with greed at any garbage re- mains" (1899:11:167). Kreinovich, in a paper de- voted specifically to the role and function of the dog in Nivkh society, paints a different picture (1930b). He points out that care and training of dogs required a tremendous effort, and that the Nivkh spared nothing to ensure the survival and well being of their animals. However it may be, and the evi- dence certainly points that way, their criteria for selection differed from the Western ones. Nivkh dogs were fed on a regular basis the same kind of basic staple food as the people them- selves: fish and seal blubber. Dog food was cooked on the same hearth as that for the people - in sum- mer a fresh fish broth, in winter, broth made of yukola. The dogs were fed once a day, in summer in the evening, in winter at noon. Water was given twice daily. In summer the dogs were rarely used for economic tasks and they roamed the neighbor- hood of the settlement and often provided themselves with extra tidbits by catching an animal or fish. In winter, when the dogs were used for transportation and a variety of other tasks, their food was regu- lated with greater stringency: one fish carcass per dog per day was allocated. On trips, the dogs were fed twice, once during the midday rest break and once at night. Snow substituted for water. On these occasions only were the dogs fed dry food. At home, fish broth was the standard, and its preparation was women's job. The dogs were brought inside the dwelling for feeding, where they were given their meal on a specially constructed trestle table (Kreino- vich, 1930b:30-31; Shrenk, 1899:11:168, Plate XII). Dogs were fed in a definite order of precedence - the first party being the sled teams (Kreinovich, 1930b:31) - from special troughs that accommodated five to six or more dogs. To minimize the inevitable fighting, the dogs being fed were tied with thongs</page><page sequence="88">88 Arctic Anthropology X-l and chains suspended from the rafters over the feeding table. The dogs, inseparable from humans in their daily life, had their own shelters." In summer they had a simple windbreak type of shelter, or were simply tied to a row of closely placed poles, spaced at such a distance that fighting was impossible. This constraint was mostly applied to sled dogs. In winter the dogs either had specially built, rela- tively substantial shelters (Taksami, 1961:153; Kreinovich, 193 Ob: 32) or the windbreak was im- proved for winter residence by daily changes of dried grass. The various types of windbreaks and structures used as dog shelters are described in detail by Kreinovich (193 Ob: 31). Bitches and puppies had special quarters. According to Kreino- vich, who on this point directly contradicts Shrenk, a bitch was fed separately from all other dogs and better than they, especially while she was nursing (1930b:32). The Nivkh treated the puppies differen- tially, according to sex. On this point, again, the testimony is either unclear or contradictory. Kreino- vich states that female pups were killed by strangl- ing as soon as their fur was deemed to be of good quality (193 Ob: 32) but that male pups were killed only if they were weak. Male dogs only were used for sled teams and the training commenced early,** with the puppies being tied in pairs at the sleeping bench. At six months, the inexperienced young dog had his first chance to be harnessed in the last position with an experienced team. As the pupil improved, his position in the harnessing order changed. Special care was taken in the selection of pos- sible lead dogs. The lead dog was usually the strongest animal in the team, and possibly the most intelligent one. A candidate would be har- nessed immediately behind an experienced lead dog to acquaint it with the commands. The Nivkh di- rected their dogs only by voice. Eventually the candidate was permitted to lead on short stretches of well-known road until finally he was graduated to the full status of lead dog (Kreinovich, 193 Ob: 3 3). Kreinovich states that the training of the lead dogs was a difficult matter, and not every man was con- sidered adept at it. There were specialists famed for their skill, but "there were no rules for such training, all depended on the individuality of the Gilyak who trained the dog" (1930b:33). Characteristic of the Nivkh practice of sled dog keeping was the fact that all dogs were cas- trated, t After the operation, the dog was tied and then led around on a leash several times per day to avoid faulty healing of the scrotum. The dogs were also prevented from entering water to avoid infection of the wound (Kreinovich, 1930b:33). Sled team dogs also underwent the operation of tail removal. It was explained that the blood loss occasioned by this operation ensured the dog's health (Kreinovich, 1930b:33).t The Nivkh recognized several illnesses to which dogs were subject. Any pain was relieved by blood letting. Nails deformed by running on the hard crust of the snow were treated by cutting the paws above the claws and letting out blood. How- ever, the Nivkh recognized the cause of the condi- tion and tried to spare the dogs too much travelling over ice; on the Okhotsk sea coast, the Nivkh made special shoes of soft skin for their dogs when road conditions were icy (Kreinovich, 193 Ob: 34). Dogs were wormed by making them drink an infusion of bog laurel {boguVnik in Russian). For diverse other ailments magical means, analogous to those employed for humans, were used. Wounds were treated with pitch. An accident to a dog in harness, a broken leg, or death, was attributed to the action of the evil spirit (mil'k) who also caused harm to humans. Rabies was known and ascribed to possession by an especially malignant spirit. Rabid dogs were killed by a blow of a club which was then destroyed and the body of the dog was thrown into the wilder- ness (Kreinovich, 193 Ob: 34). On occasion, again analogous to interpretation of human death, a dog death could be attributed to election by a deity, the Master of an element, who was seen as having taken a special fancy to the particular animal (Kreinovich, 1930b:36). Color symbolism was important in the selection of dogs for teams. The ideal team consisted of an uneven number of dogs, not less than nine, all black, except for the lead dog, who was white. It should be noted that black color was apparently associated with the domain of the Master of the Mountain/Forest and white with the domain of the Master of the Waters. There are also indications that white was the color of power and an attribute *See the section on settlement and dwellings for additional details. **For a description of the training process, see Kreinovich, 1930b:32-33; feeding: Kreinovich, 1930b:30-31; Shrenk, 1899:11:166-169; housing: Taksami, 1961:153. tFor a full description of the castration process see Kreinovich, 1930b:33. + 1 believe that the explanation of this act must be sought in the symbolic equivalence of dog and man; in man, blood is the container of the soul, and it may be that this concept applies to dogs as well, as implicit in their treatment (blood letting, etc.). This relation, however, is not stated explicitly by the ethnographers.</page><page sequence="89">Black: The Nivkh S9 of the Supreme Deity.* Actual teams seldom com- plied with the ideal. Both Shrenk and Kreinovich noted explicitly that in reality dog teams were of mixed colors. What has been said so far gives an indication that in the Nivkh system of thought there was an affinity between men and dogs. Another more di- rect indication is the Nivkh notion of incest rules pertaining to dogs that somewhat parallel the rules for humans. Kreinovich states: "Each Gilyak has for stud one male, taken from another bitch, as in- cest is prohibited for dogs as well as for people" (193 Ob: 33). Nivkh believe that dogs of the same parentage, that is brothers and sisters, do not copulate and if they do and the delict is proven, the animals are killed. It is considered that such animals are changelings, unnatural creatures (Shternberg, 1904b:I:26; 1933:184). Shternberg states: "In the Gilyak ideology brothers and sisters among dogs do not couple. If this happens, the agency of a mil'k, the evil spirit, is presumed operative. The guilty dogs have to be killed im- mediately, otherwise the sin of incest will fall on the man who owns them. The dogs are killed rit- ually, by strangulation, and the blood sprinkled in the four directions of the compass. 'Incest1 among animals of different generations is ignored" (1933: 153, 343). As an economic asset dogs were individual property (Shternberg, 1893:35); statistically, Shternberg estimated that there were two dogs for each person, or three dogs for each adult member of the population (1893:45-46). Most important were the lead dogs who were valued from 30-50 rubles (gold) in terms of pre- revolutionary Russian currency, while the ordinary team dogs went for 3-8 rubles apiece (Shternberg, 1904b:I:19). Dogs could form part of the bride gift, but this was con- sidered to be undesirable and less prestigious than traditional prestige goods items, and they were thus used only by indigent, less successful and possibly a bit less traditionally inclined persons (Shtern- berg, 1933:278). In the juridical system, the dog, too, was con- sidered property with the possible added component of symbolic restitution for the sin committed. As we have seen, dogs often were a portion of assessed fines for ritual transgressions, and in disputes brought for adjudication before the community (Shternberg, 1933:70).** The Nivkh loaned and borrowed, debts were recognized and repayment was a legal obligation. If one defaulted on a just debt, the creditor could take one's sled dogs either openly or stealthily in recompense (Shternberg, 1893:37; 1904b:III:107). In minor disputes between individuals, caused for example by offenses against personal dignity, reconciliation was achieved by a willing gift of dogs on the part of the offender (Shternberg, 1893: 41). In the social system, governed by explicitly stated rules of generalized reciprocity, the dog played an important role as an object of reciprocal gift giving. Kreinovich writes: The dog plays a great role in the gift ex- change of the Gilyak. The gift giving, in the form that I have observed, is in its essence an exchange. Gilyak from differ- ent areas begift each other predominantly with items which are abundant in one area but lacking in another. . . . Unreciprocated gift giving does not exist. The gift must be returned absolutely obligatorily by something quite different from what was given origi- nally; to return the gift with the same items is the height of uncivility. However, the return gift must in its value be approxi- mately equal to the original gift. Among the Gilyak almost all items have an as- signed value. ... If a Gilyak gives a dog as a gift without asking to keep the collar, it is bad manners to return the collar right *See the section on world view re the asso- ciation between the Master of the Waters and the Creator and Master of the Sky. Shternberg notes: "Tajrnanz: he alone sends fish; he is a big strong man. All his dogs are white. He travels in the air along the Milky Way, he lives there also. He also makes thunder. Each khal (lineage) has its own pal' nivukh (Master of the Mountain/Forest), its own ToV Nivukh (Master of the Waters), even its own miVk (malignant spirit), but Tajrnanz is one" (1933:321). It should be noted that in Rus- sian the Nivkh nivukh (man) and yz (master) are glossed as the same or used interchangeably. It is possible that in Nivkh a conceptual distinction is made between a Man and Master of the domain. Uneven numbers are associated with the mascu- line principle. **Shternberg believed that inclusion of dogs in a fine had symbolic significance. The Nivkh had a list of minor transgressions against persons and property, all with a symbolic connotation, in which restitution was effected by the giving of a dog (1933:313, 335). In a footnote (1933:70) he cites the case of a woman who was accused by a staid middle aged man of unseemly advances - grabbing his leg (an invitation to a sexual liaison). She admitted the act and being poor was assessed one puppy (emphasis added) and a set of birchbark dishes.</page><page sequence="90">90 Arctic Anthropology X-l away. It will be returned a year hence and with it will be wrapped a gift - but under no circumstances a dog - and will be so delivered to the original owner. . . . Dogs are a common means of exchange and gift giving; for dogs one may obtain a boat, seal skins, seal fat, nettle fiber for seines in the old times, silver, silks, which may be used for kalym* and finally, for very good sled dogs, one may even obtain a wife (1930b:38-39). In another sphere of Nivkh social life, again with ritual connotations , dogs were even more im- portant. In the great festivals held to reaffirm the unity of the lineage and of the living with the an- cestors and through them with the powers of the elements, races formed an integral and very im- portant part (dog races were held during the bear festival; boat races were held during seasonal ceremonies to the Master of the Waters; to my knowledge, the significance of these races has not been investigated, or at least not reported in the ethnographic literature). At the bear festival two forms of race were held: in one, the dog teams raced alone, without a driver; in another, usually over a long distance, drivers would guide the teams. The dog races have been mentioned in the context of ritual by Shtern- berg (1904b:II:83; 1933:297-298), and described by Shrenk (1903:111:73-74) and Kreinovich (1930b:37). In the races in which drivers participated, the loser was met with ridicule; his dogs were switched by the crowds, causing him to lose face. According to Kreinovich, this type of race was a purely social occasion (1930b:37). The ritual race, according to Kreinovich, was the driverless one, in which teams were composed of the best dogs donated for the occasion by all lineage members. Weak dogs were eliminated from the race in repeated tries and the prestige of the winning dogs ' owners was enhanced. Here is his description of such a race: The ground for the dog races the Gilyak prepared on the ice of the bay, not too far from the house of Mizgun, the host of the bear festival. At the start and finish they placed a small fir tree, stripped of bottom branches and decorated with inau. The start and finish of the racing track were always so arranged that the dogs ran toward the house of the host of the festival. Be- fore dragging the dogs to the starting line, *Kalym , a word of Turkic origin adopted in Russian literature to designate bride price and bride price. the Gilyaks led them into Mizgun1 s house, sat them on the sleeping bench and threw onto the fire several green fir branches. Mizgun told me that before the race the dogs must breath the aroma of the pitchy fir (1930b:37). While the above passage adds some interesting details, the rest of Kreinovich1 s description agrees with the one given in Shrenk (1903:111:73-74): how the dogs were excited by voice commands while being tied to the tree at the starting line and how a single dog, dragging a black mitt, was let loose before the team. As this dog ran, the man who had kept the sled and dog team stationary released the fastenings and sled brake, and the dogs were off. The dogs that showed weakness were eliminated from subsequent races, which were repeated for several days. The conduct of dogs during those races, the results, etc., formed an endless topic of excited conversation and even led to heated dis- agreement. In marriage and betrothal the dog had an im- portant symbolic function. In the section on settle- ment and dwelling I have briefly mentioned the "bitch" which was believed to reside on the third beam over the door (number three being a male num- ber) and whose presence there had definite sexual overtones. It is reasonable to infer that the func- tion of fertility insurance as well as protection against evil influences constituted elements of conceptualization of this figure. The notion is lent strength by Shrenk 's statement that infertile women and also women desiring more children wore dog tooth amulets suspended from their necks (Shrenk, 1903:111:11). The function of protection and perhaps insurance of good luck for women may be inferred from the manner in which the dog figures in betrothal between real cross cousins and in the marriage of any woman. The ritual giving of a male dog by the boy's father and the plaiting of dog hair and nettle thread by the boy's mother by means of which the FZS and MBD were "tied" - these symbolic objects placed on the wrists of the children being betrothed - have been described on the basis of Shternberg's data (cited above). Kreinovich confirms Shternberg's description in all details, but adds that the girl's father could never sell or give away this dog. He gives the native name for this animal which glosses, roughly translated into English, as "The Dog that Makes the Woman Forbidden" (sexual prohibition is meant here). He also states that apparently an af- finity was established between the girl and the dog, or at the very least a strong symbolic tie. If the child (the girl) fell ill, protective amulets were made for her from the hair of this dog and her milk teeth, when they fell out, were fed to it (1930b:50). Further, in all cases of marriage, when a girl</page><page sequence="91">Black: The Nivkh 91 was transferred from her natal lineage to the home of her husband, she was given, in addition to a dowry of prestige goods, a bitch by her nearest agnatic kin. Kreinovich states: Even the poorest Gilyak, unable to give their daughters any sort of dowry, try to give at least a bitch and a kettle. True, I witnessed how the old man Samygin of the village Us'kvo, giving away his daughter in marriage to the son of Florun in Chirivo, let her go without a bitch. More than the tattered dress she wore, he couldn't give her. A month or two later, a young Gilyak Kurn, a member of the same lineage, brought his own bitch to Chirivo and gave her to Florun, as it is unseemly to give away a woman into another line- age without a bitch (193 Ob: 51). Kreinovich surmises that not only was the bitch a provider of pups for the woman in her new home and lineage, but also served to protect her from evil influences (1930b: 51). In the conceptual schema, dogs were explicitly seen as mediators between the human and the di- vine (Kreinovich, 1930b:43) and as having an asso- ciation with cosmology. The origin of the dogs was reported as the fall of red dogs from heaven, the world above, to earth (Kreinovich, 1929:97). The sun, conceptualized as female, is the abode of a bitch. An eclipse occurs when the bitch begins to devour the sun. To save the sun the Nivkh ran outside, carrying with them a variety of metal ob- jects and, striking metal against metal, called out the name of, respectively, a red, white or black bitch, depending on the shade of the sun in eclipse. An analogous belief is held in regard to the moon (Kreinovich, 1929:80-81). Dogs are believed to have the quality of seeing and hearing spirits; the howling of dogs at night is explained by the fact that they see the Master of the Waters who ex- amines the storehouses (Kreinovich, 1930b:48). The Nivkh apparently believe that sexual union with dogs is possible, but their attitude on this point is by no means clear in ethnographies. Shtern- berg reported great indignation and aversion when it was reported that a certain individual on the Tym1 allegedly copulated with a dog (1933:256), but Kreinovich (1930b) reports that beliefs were held that children result from such unions, that they are hairless, naked and often with human heads and hands, and that such "puppies" cry like children. He does not report aversion and horror as does Shternberg (1930b:49, footnote). Here the situation of the dog in the conceptual schema is ambiguous, as is that of many animals which are seen as sym- bolic mediators. Shternberg, on the basis of folk- lore, leads us to believe that the primary distinction between animals and humans lay in the orderliness versus dis orderliness of their sexual relationships (1933:256). However, dogs' sexual life was not unregulated, as the penalty for incest shows. The Nivkh distinguished many colors among their animals , and the animals were valued in rela- tion to color. The dog was the prime sacrificial animal, of- fered in many ritual contexts. The following list of symbolic associations by color should be seen as a key to understanding some aspects of Nivkh ritual system: red dogs, the color of the original dog population which fell from heaven, were sacrificed to the Master of the Heavens (of the World Above) (Shternberg, 1933:312) as well as to Kur1 - appar- ently Master of the Earth (Shternberg, 1933:332); red dogs were also sacrificed within nine days of arrival in a new location, when the ritual combined elements of petition for protection against illness, want, poor fortune, and enemies (Taksami, 1961: 107). I make the last inference on the basis of the association of violence with the World of the Above and of the fact that before a vengeance raid a sacri- ficial red dog was hung on a tree branch in such fashion that its nose faced toward heaven. The party then set out, believed to be led by a black, red- beaked bird of vengeance that gave strength to their cause (Kreinovich, 1930b:44). Black dogs were sacrificed in all rituals directed to the Master of the Mountain/Forest (Shternberg, 1933:313), including the bear ritual (Kreinovich, 1930b:43), and in all expiatory rites connected with offences associated with items dedicated to the Master of the Mountain/ Forest (Shternberg, 1933:314). White dogs were associated with the Master of the Waters (Shtern- berg, 1933:313, 332; Kreinovich, 1930b:43) and in the ritual uniting two persons, of which one was the savior, the other the saved, in a drowning incident; each was flanked by a white dog. A dog whose color par d is glossed in Russian as "yellow" was sacrificed in vengeance cases to the bird of violence but the significance of this color is not made clear (Kreinovich, 1930b:43). In a special category is a dog whose descrip- tion in English may be given as "wooly" or, perhaps "shaggy" (lokhmataia sobaka in Russian). In the chain of association and transformation human (life)- dog-bear-ancestor-divinity, this color dog could be substituted as a stand-in for the bear. If in sacri- fice the dog was a stand-in for the human element, and the bear a stand-in for the deceased lineage kinsmen, in certain circumstances one could be sub- stituted for another. Perhaps it was a device to en- able the Nivkh to honor the law in its breach. Such dogs had the name luk and they were given in resti- tution for all offences committed wittingly or unwit- tingly by strangers or kinsmen against the ritual</page><page sequence="92">92 Arctic Anthropology X-l space and ritual paraphernalia or the order of the bear feast (Shternberg, 1933:313). These dogs were uigt marked, tabooed (Shternberg, 1933:299). When selected as a substitute for a bear, it was called ngakh chin khanyng, "dog placed in the cage. " It was an inviolate rule that a bear could not be sold, but since greed was apparently opera- tive among the Nivkh, as everywhere, it did happen that a Nivkh would sell a bear. The buyer, then, gave a "woolly" dog to the seller, and the dog was placed inside the empty bear cage. This dog re- mained with the bear seller until its death and could not be beaten or abused in any manner. It could, however, be sacrificed on an occasion asso- ciated with the Master of the Mountain/Forest. The luk, and uig, the substitutes for another ritual animal and means of restitution for offenses committed in connection with that animal, consti- tuted a sub-class of consecrated or dedicated dogs. The generic name of this class of dogs was uiglang khlang. They could have been dedicated to the Master of any element, including Fire. Each house- hold head possessed at least two such animals, dedicated respectively to the Masters of the Moun- tain/Forest and the Waters , but he could have more. It was believed that maintenance of such dedicated animals resulted in the benevolent disposition of the Powers toward man. These dogs pulled sleds like their less exalted brethren, but they could never be beaten, abused, sold or given away as gins. When they grew old, they were ritually killed in a manner prescribed for sacrifice to each deity. A dog became such a consecrated animal in the following manner: the Nivkh ate part of their ritual food offerings and left a specifically desig- nated portion for the Master of a domain. This food was placed at the base of a tree or at the edge of the water, the selection of which was determined by the sphere of the Master for whom it was in- tended. A dog, by voluntarily eating the ritual food at the ritual spot, became uiglang khlang. There- after, the dog ate the remains of the raw materials from which ritual dishes were prepared. When a consecrated dog grew old and was ritually killed, it was replaced by another, younger, one (Kreino- vich, i930b:44-45). The dogs' affinity, one is almost tempted to say identity, with man is apparent in many ritual situations. The dog sacrifice in the bear ritual will be discussed below. The same conceptual schema of the dog as a stand-in for an individual or a group is evident in the sacrifice which con- cludes negotiations for peaceful settlement of a blood feud. The settlement, described in detail elsewhere, was validated by the final act, when two dogs, one given by each contending party, were led between the lines and, contrary to the usual ritual usage of strangulation, speared so that their blood (the carrier of the soul in Nivkh belief) was shed and mixed. The hearts were cut out and reserved to satisfy the Bird of Vengeance, while the rest of the carcasses was ritually dressed, cooked and consumed by members of both parties (Shternberg, 1904b:III:93; 1933:105).* An additional expiatory sacrifice, apparently, was also demanded. While the first sacrifice restored relationships between the groups, the second restored relationships be- tween the human and divine: "Even when the mat- ter ends in ransom, the Bird of Violence remains unappeased: imperative is the expiatory sacrifice in the form of a dog, whose heart is given to the Bird; otherwise, the Bird would take vengeance on both sides" (Shternberg, 19 04b: III: 8 5). Dogs were also sacrificed in propitiatory rit- uals, such as the sacrifice of black puppies to appease the wind, to atone for a sin committed, to ensure recovery from illness, and for good luck in the hunt. The choice of the victim by color, the manner of its dispatch and the disposition of the body all were dictated by the "target" and "end" of the sacrifice.** Sacrificial dogs formed an im- portant component of funeral rituals. In addition to the stand-in relationship be- tween human groups and dogs, there was a well articulated affinity between individuals and dogs. Elements of this affinity have been touched upon in discussing other aspects of Nivkh culture (life- cycle, marriage). That the Nivkh associated men and dogs is illustrated by the following quote from Kreinovich: In Agivo, in the winter of 1928 a dead child was born to the wife of the Gilyak Pnargun. The umbilical cord was tightly wrapped around the infant's neck. The Gilyaks ac- cused Pnargun himself and ... a bitch of the death. It so happened, that in the period of waxing moon near the time when his wife was expected to give birth, a bitch belong- ing to Pnargun whelped. Not wishing to feed the litter, he strangled the puppies with a noose. Had he not done so, his child would not have been born with a noose around its neck (1930a: 91). There are many instances in the literature when Nivkh are quoted as expressing interpersonal rela- tionships with reference to dogs and persons likened to dogs (Shternberg, 1933:282; Kreinovich, 1930a:99). *Kreinovich (1930b:44) simply paraphrases Shternberg. **Analysis of ritual action of the Nivkh forms part of my dissertation (in preparation) which focuses on the structure of the Nivkh symbolic system.</page><page sequence="93">Black: The Nivkh 93 The carcasses of sacrificed dogs were never eaten by the sacrificer alone, but by members of the kin group, with the meat distributed in a certain prescribed order (Kreinovich, 1930b:30). The heads and paws of the animals sacrificed to the Master and Mistress of the Fire were usually attached to the entry of the house. Notable is the fact that at this particular sacrifice the invited guests and recipients of the meat were children of lineage kinsmen (Kreinovich, 1930b:45-46). The affinity goes further, however. Each per- son, and especially all males, have an alter ego in the shape of a dog. Shternberg and Kreinovich, who devoted much effort to an elucidation of the Nivkh world view, are not very clear on the point of acquisition of this alter ego. Either at birth or (according to Kreinovich) in families where many children have died previously, bracelets of dog hair were placed on a child's limbs and thus the child and dog were tied for life. When the child fell ill, protective amulets were made for it from this dog's hair. When the child lost its milk teeth, these were fed to this same dog. Boys had a male, girls a female dog as their alter ego - which seems to contradict previously quoted data that milk teeth of a female betrothed cross cousin were fed to the male dog given her father by the family of the groom. If the child had no such alter ego dog from birth, feeding of the milk teeth to an animal estab- lished this relationship. These dogs could not be sold, given away or abused in any manner and, moreover, a menstruating woman dared not step over it, otherwise the human would be injured. When this dog became old it had to be killed by ritual strangulation. The person to whom it be- longed had to participate in this process. A noose was tied to a pole and five men, one for each leg and one for the tail, pulled in one direction against the noose (Kreinovich, 1930b:29). It was imperative that the dog's master himself performed the killing. If the dog had been fed a girl's teeth, and later had to be killed, her brother was forbidden the meat, and, reciprocally, a boy's sister could not partake of the meat of the dog who had been fed his milk- teeth. As mentioned earlier, in cases of illness amu- lets designed to protect and avert misfortune were made of the alter ego dog's hair. However, if a per- son's illness was attributed to an offence against the Bird of Violence (or Bird of Vengeance), a group of elders performed a sacrifice on his behalf: a special dog was selected, strangled, its heart cut out and offered to the Bird, with the rest of the meat not eaten but left in the wilderness. In addition to his alter ego dog, each person had a soul-male, called pryski - usually the best and/or best beloved dog belonging to a person. This dog participated in the funeral rites but was not killed. It either accompanied the bear to the funeral place or was placed on the corpse's chest. After cremation it was brought back to the dwelling, placed on the deceased's sleeping place and fed from bowls and dishes used by humans for two or three years, depending on the sex of the deceased. Then it was disposed of into a lineage of wife- takers. Kreinovich writes: "A Gilyak is sure that a dog can replace a sick person, protect him, save him from death and finally that the killing of the dog expiates a breach of taboo (193 Ob: 54). XVI. THE KILLER WHALE45 AND THE BEARAh If the dog was a stand-in for the living, their extension of being so to speak, the stand-ins for the ancestors were the bear and the killer whale. Unfortunately, information on the latter available in the literature at hand is very sketchy. Shtern- berg notes that this animal occupied a position with respect to the Master of the Waters analogous to that of the bear with respect to the Master of the Mountain/Forest. While the bear sometimes was characterized as "the dog of the Master," the killer whale was characterized as "the boat of the Master" (Shternberg, 1904b:III:21, 22-25; Zolotarev, 1933: 60-61). Kreinovich states that the Nivkh maintained relationships with the Master of the Waters through the mediation of kinsmen who were drowned (1929: 92). Certain details of rituals accompanying the washing ashore of the killer whale carcass permit the conclusion that these rituals paralleled in sig- nificance the bear festival, the only difference be- ing that their performance was contingent upon the availability of the carcass. Apparently the killer whale was not hunted and no one in his right senses was expected to do so (Zolotarev, 1933:61). Shternberg states that the carcass was solemnly buried in a specially built enclosure decorated with inau, reminiscent of enclosures in which twins or persons killed by bears were interred (1904b:II:25). Zolotarev states that the bones (emphasis added) were thus preserved (1933:61). Bearing in mind the Nivkh symbolic expression of the agnatic tie as one of bone, the affinal tie through women as one of flesh, and the blood as container of the soul, the vital essence of the person's life and personality, and the fact that women were barred from both rit- uals, credence of the hypothesis of parallelism be- comes more than feasible.* *See Taksami, 1971, p. 205, for a description of a wooden figurine of a toothed monster with a fin (MAE collection 4975-12) apparently connected with the Master of the Waters.</page><page sequence="94">94 Arctic Anthropology X-l The best known, best described and most studied of all lineage rituals among the Nivkh (and their neighbors) is, of course, the so-called bear ritual, the only common denominator between the otherwise diverse rites of the Nivkh and other in- habitants of the area in this respect being the fact that a bear is sacrificed.* Among the Nivkh the bear ritual reflected and, in symbolic form, restated social relationships. Three types of bear rituals among the Nivkh are described in the literature. The first type, mentioned frequently in this paper, is the final act in the cycle of rites following a kinsman's death; the second and third type deal, respectively, with an individual's adoption into a lineage and with lineage fusion. Such adoption and fusion have, to my knowledge, been described in published sources only by Shternberg (1933:297- 299), who also mentions that bear festivals were sometimes held to restore amicable relationships between lineages of wife- givers and wife-takers if a serious breach had occurred. Several descriptions of the Nivkh bear ritual of the first type are extant, and while all agree in essentials, there are variations in detail (Shrenk, 1903:111:64-103; Shternberg, 1904b:II:31-45; Zolo- tarev, 1933:60-63; Taksami, 1967:217-221). Zolo- tarev, who did not himself observe a bear festival but based his description on informants' statements, claimed that there were significant differences, but he also believed that these differences in cult ob- servances were due to lineage differentiation, that is, that each lineage performed a structurally iden- tical ritual with lineage specific variations (1933: 61-63, 65).** Taksami treats the bear ritual as fundamentally the same for all Nivkh kin groups and definitely associates the rituals with lineage structure and ancestor worship. The brief descrip- tion given here, concentrating on essential features, is based on Shternberg 's detailed account with additional details drawn from the work of Taksami. As stated, the bear festival was given by line- age kinsmen as the final commemoration of a dead kinsman who would be viewed henceforth as a benevolent ancestor, but it was not strictly speak- ing a commemorative act. It was a festive occasion signalling restoration of order and resumption of *For a comparative approach see specifically B. A. Vasil'ev, Medvezhii Prazdnik in Sovetskaia Etnografìa, 1948, No. 4, though his analysis is open to criticism. **Zolotarev's ethnography, Gilyaki, 1941, ac- cording to my information, has not been published. It is listed in HRAF Paleosiberian Peoples and Languages, Jakobson et al.

The festival was not confined to the lineage which lost a member: it was an interlineage affair, participation being determined by affinal ties - wife- takers of the lineage giving the festival, that is the lineages into which agnatic kinswomen of the lineage had gone, were the invited guests who had a special ritual role to perform. The preparation for the festival lasted several years, as ideally the sacrificial animal had to be raised in the lineage - that is, captured as a cub and brought to maturity in the settlement in a specially constructed corral with all kinsmen con- tributing to its upkeep. Of course, when a bear was killed in a hunt or as a result of an unsuccessful attempt to capture it alive, a festival was held, but with much less elaboration of detail and ceremony. Apparently the number of years the animal was kept in the village depended on the sex of the animal. It is probable that male animals were sacrificed for men and females for women and that associated ceremonial sub-sets to be described were performed an uneven number of times when male animals were involved and even number of times for the females. As noted by Shrenk, who was not able to ob- serve the entire cycle of bear festival activities, the rite fell into several well defined phases (1903: 111:64-103). The festival was usually held in winter; its name was glossed by Shternberg as "games" (chkhyv lekhernd). An important part of the festival were competitive dog races and group games, and apparently it was the only occasion on which the Nivkh (old women only) performed a sort of a dance (Shrenk, op. cit.). The cub was acquired by the nearest important kinsman of the deceased, whether by capture, by purchase from outsiders (non-Nivkh) or from a co- tribesman with the substitution of a long hair "woolly" dog accompanying the exchange. The cubs were then raised in the village. The actual day on which the festivities were to begin was set by the "lineage greyheads" (Taksami, 1967:217-218). Women pre- pared ritual foods, foremost among them the mosr, described earlier. The preliminary act was the "Feeding of the Master of the Locality" from these dishes (Taksami, 1967:218). All lineage kinsmen contributed to the expense of the feast in the form of food, money and labor (Shternberg, 19 04b: II: 3 3). Another preliminary activity was the preparation of the sacrificial site. It was a relatively small por- tion of even ground marked off by saplings. In the center were placed pairs of "sacred trees bedecked with inau" (Shternberg, 1904b:II:33), as many pairs as there were bears to be sacrificed. These posts were elaborately carved in ritual design (Shternberg, 1904b:II:33). The path to this ritual ground was lo- cated between the house of the giver of the feast and the lezang, the ritual barn in which bear feast</page><page sequence="95">Black: The Nivkh paraphernalia, the skulls and the bones of sacri- ficed beasts and possibly the bones of the dogs sacrificed in the last act of the drama were kept.* According to Taksami, skins and bones of the sacri- ficed dogs were kept not in the lezang but next to it (1961:158). Only one main lezang was con- structed per lineage, the segments that had relo- cated having only temporary ritual structures and being under obligation eventually to transfer the relics of the sacrificed animal to the lineage lezang (Taksami, 1961:158). The first ritual day Shternberg (1904b: II: 33) calls the "eve" and had the Nivkh name glossed as "the day of inau preparation. " Inau have different significance and each type was on this occasion prepared in pairs corresponding to male and female categories. According to Shternberg, these pairs of ritual wood shavings were referred to as "spouses" (1904b:II:33). While the younger males were engaged in carving inau, the owner of the bear in company with the elders and the respected men of the lineage left to meet the guests, who were, on this occasion, called narkh: members of lineages into which women of the lineage of the feast givers had been married into. In addition, the immediate wife-taking group had a right to bring its wife-takers, that is the "distant" wife- takers of the feast givers, their tujma-ymgi. The most important role of the narkh was, in this con- text, that of executioner of the sacrificial bears. Only a wife-taker could kill the animal. For a member of the lineage offering the bear to do so would have been sacrilege. If several bears were sacrificed at the same time, the persons whose duty it was to kill them came from different lineages of wife-takers. Shternberg states that as many as ten or more lineages could participate in the ritual as a consequence of the system. The duty of the hosts was to meet the arriving narkh solemnly outside the village and to escort them to the festival dwelling, suitably treating them to food and drink. According to Shrenk (1903: 111:67-80) several days elapsed before the begin- ning of the festival and the killing of the bear; in the interim inau were made and games conducted. Shternberg states that the bear was killed the next day after the arrival of the narkh. Taksami's data tend to support Shrenk's statement (1967:218-219). The essential feature, however, mentioned in detail by all authors, was that between the beginning of the festival and the sacrificial killing, the bear was led around the settlement from dwelling to dwelling and also brought into the dwellings, most specifi- cally into the dwelling of the owner of the animal where it was kept chained to the central posts for *See illustrations by Shrenk and Taksami. certain time intervals, sometimes overnight, and honored and fed from a ritual spoon by all males, even the smallest children. Women were not per- mitted to touch these posts. Taksami notes that all dogs that were scheduled to participate in the com- petitive ritual dog races which preceded the sacri- fice also were brought into the house after the bear was removed from it, and that a special mat in the back of the dwelling was made for them. The dogs were kept on this mat for a short time (fifteen minutes in the case observed by Taksami (1967: 218). The leading of the bear around the settlement and into the dwellings was accompanied by another ritual action, in addition to ceremonial feeding and offering of water to the beast: males touched the bear, but it was especially incumbent on the owner to come close and bring his face into close proxim- ity with the bear's muzzle, as if to give him a good- by kiss (Shternberg, 1904b:II:34). Since during the walk around the bear was teased to make it rise on its hind legs, the animal was in no gentle mood and more likely than not attacked the man. A wound thus sustained was a mark of honor, a sort of lay- ing on of hands in reverse. This walking about and bringing the bear into the houses was repeated sev- eral times, the exact number (even or odd) appar- ently according to the sex of the animal. Shternberg states that the final act was the leading of the bear three times around the house of the owner. Games and dog races were held in the intervals between these tours. Taksami states that this phase lasted three days, and that games were held in the case he observed for three days (1967:218). During almost the entire period, including the bringing of the bear to the ritual grounds, women drummed on a suspended dry larch log. The staff used to tease the bear, a sapling stripped of branches except for a small crown, was afterwards fixed over the hearth, so that the crown almost touched the smoke hole. The guests were entertained with food and drink throughout. Just before dawn on the day of sacrifice, the bear was brought to the prepared ground and tied between two posts. He was led to this place of execution along a prepared path lined with trees previously cut down. All sorts of ceremonial and festive dishes were brought to the sacrificial ground and all males partook of the food there. The narkh chose among themselves the best shots with bow and arrow. It was expected, if the sacrifice was acceptable to the powers , that the bear would volun- tarily offer a good place for the point so that death would be instantaneous. If the narkh did not kill the bear with a maximum of three arrows , he was fined and the fine paid in dogs. Before the killing, the eldest of the lineage fed the bear in a ritual manner pronouncing a ritual formula (Shternberg,</page><page sequence="96">96 Arctic Anthropology X-l Fig. 28. Bear ritual.

The women in the distance drummed on the log. The actual killing was preceded by a sort of archery competition between the narkh and the hosts, the latter deliberately missing the target set up for the purpose. Finally, the animal was approached by the eldest men of the two groups, the hosts and the guests, each carrying a kettle and an ax.* Others followed carrying bows and arrows. About a hun- dred feet from the animal the kettles and the axes were placed on the ground. These were called, as were the similar objects in the wedding ceremony, "mine" and "thine" and were exchanged at the time of the guests1 departure (Shternberg, 1904b: 11:35-36). At this point, the chosen narkh stepped forward, approached the bear (who by this time had been teased into rising on his hind legs) and loosened the arrow. As the beast fell, several men threw themselves down on the animal to hasten its demise by strangling it (Shternberg, 1904b:II:36). According to Shternberg, any unnecessary suffering of the animal was to be avoided. The carcass then was placed in ritual position facing west. According to Taksami it was at this point that the leaders of the two kin groups per- formed the ritual exchange of axes (1967:219). The carcass was quartered in ritual order, the skin be- ing taken off in one piece with the head attached. Again, Shrenk's and Taksami 's accounts agree that the skins and meat were placed for a time in lezang and only later (according to Taksami a week later) brought into the house of the owner.** The skin with the head and meat were brought into the dwelling either through the smoke hole or through a window, if the house was a more modern type. Taksami explains this custom in the follow- ing manner: It is because of the impurity of women, so said the Nivkh, that the bear's head is brought into the house and removed from it through the smoke hole in subterranean dwellings and through the window in the surface dwellings (1961:162). The impurity mentioned in the above passage refers, as is evident from other contexts, and as stated by Taksami, to menstrual blood; menstruating women use the entrance and step over the threshold. The skin and the head were then placed on a special wooden frame at the back of the dwelling, in the place of honor and on a mat of evergreens. A bow and arrow may have been placed under it also (Shternberg, 1904b:II:37). All ritual foods as well as sturgeon were placed before the head in special ceremonial dishes. The bear meat was cooked by the "lineage greyheads" in a slow de- liberate process, solemnly, with accompanying ritual observances. The cooking may last several days, perhaps once again the number of days (even or odd) determined by the sex of the animal that has been sacrificed (Taksami, 1967:219). This day was called "the day of the feeding of the head." The animal was referred to as "old man" or "old woman," depending on the sex (Zolotarev, 1933:62) with the connotation of "ancient," "great." A record of the event was made in wood - on the dishes used and also on a special spoon carved for the occasion (Kreinovich, 1934b:184-185; Zolo- tarev, 1933:62). The members of the host lineage partook of all dishes except the bear meat. This was distributed and eaten on the following day, called "day of feed- ing the narkh11 (Shternberg, 1904b:II:38). The host offered the meat to all the narkh in a ceremonial round, while they sat in a certain order around the hearth on the sleeping benches. The meat was of- fered on special dishes used only in the bear feast. Shternberg also mentions that a piece of bear fat was carried by the host from guest to guest, as each bit off a mouthful in turn (1904b:II:38). Taksami states that old men are obligatory recipients of the bear fat (1967:219). The hosts were permitted only the broth from the meat with cereals added (Shtern- berg, 1904b:II:38). The guests were expected to carry that which was not eaten away with them, packaged in birch- bark and fir branches as their portions. The entire carcass was divided among them. However, the bones could not be removed from the house, so the guests tied the bones from their portions to the col- lars of choice dogs which they gave as gifts to the host (Taksami, 1967:219). Shrenk states that bones, picked absolutely clean, were placed in the kettle in which the bear meat was cooked. He also states that in the process of the feast, guests detached pieces of meat from their allotted portions, placed them on a platter passed around by two young men, and these were then carried outside and distributed to women and children (unfortunately, he does not mention to which kin group these belonged) (1903: 111:87). Use of salt during the bear feast was absolutely forbidden and so was any shamanistic practice. The feast, consisting of dishes other than bear meat, however, went on with all present participating and games of several types going on, accompanied by a great deal of jesting and practical joking. Then the "day of the departure of the narkh" arrived. Again, Taksami and Shrenk are in agreement *See Shrenk's illustrations for the ax used in the bear ritual and the knife, decorated with fur from a bear's genitalia, used to carve the carcass. **See the illustration by Shrenk.</page><page sequence="101">Black: The Nivkh 101 that as the wife-takers left the house of the feast giver, the eldest representative of the lineage stood at the door with a fir branch (or with a ritual dish, according to Taksami) and hit each departing guest on the back, pronouncing the ritual formula: "step over my threshold. " The guests did so and then returned inside to pick up their packages of bear meat. At the moment of departure, they gave their hosts several dogs. These were led into the house and tied to the frame that held the bear skin. Ac- cording to Shternberg (1904b:II:39) it was at this point that axes and kettles were exchanged. The hosts provided dogs matching the number of those given by the guests and these were all sacrificed in pairs, expressing the male and female principle, on the same ritual ground as the bear had been sacrificed. This act was preceded, ac- cording to Taksami, by a common feasting of the owner of the bear and the chief host and the oldest members of the lineage (1967:220). The dogs were tied to the same posts as the bear had been and strangled. For this act, the bear's skin and head was once again brought to the ritual ground. Inau were made for each pair of dogs. The heads of the dogs about to be sacrificed were also decorated with inau colored by berry juices.* The dogs were fed the choice foods and the ritual farewell formula was spoken to each. The dogs were killed one by one, not simultaneously (Shternberg, 1904b:II:39). The carcasses were then placed in the same position as was the carcass of the bear on the ritual ground. All traces of blood, as was the case with the bear, were covered with snow. A fire was made outside, the dog meat cooked and all members of the host lineage, in- cluding the women, partook of it. Whatever re- mained was distributed among the families (Shtern- berg, 1904b:II:39-40; Taksami, 1967:220). The next day, the bear's head, bones, the ritual muzzle with the image of the toad,** arrows used to kill the bear and all ritual dishes, vessels and spoons were placed into lezang. This was done by the "greyheads." Taksami states that in the case he observed, dogs' heads were hung on trees around the lezang while their intestines were scattered. This ended the festival, and from then on the soul of the departed kinsman was considered to- tally benevolent and completely at peace with the universe of the living and the dead, incorporated into the domain of the Master of the Forest. The cycle of the festivities could last from a month to six weeks or more; pauses between ritual days were often of considerable duration. The authors cited in this section all agree that the Nivkh did not worship the bear as a deity and that the marks of affection and respect given it be- fore the killing and to the carcass afterwards were signs pointing to the animal's role as a stand-in for a deceased kinsman. The fact that no member of the offering lineage could kill or partake of the flesh of the slain beast, and that only the bones were preserved as ritual relics points in the same direction. Moreover, other variants of the bear ritual support more strongly both this hypothesis and the proposition that the ritual served as the expression of social order and primarily the symbol of lineage unity and marital alliance. For example, in cases where lineage strength was depleted and two or more lineages desired to unite, lineage fusion was made legal by the follow- ing ritual means: representatives of the two line- ages met and investigated respective genealogies to determine that no intermarriage which would pre- clude the union had taken place within a certain time span. If no such obstacles existed, the representa- tives declared that the lineages had always main- tained friendly relations and offered mutual help. The lineage spokesman, khl a i nivkuh , proclaimed that fusion was possible. To make the act publicly known and legally valid, the two fusing lineages gave a joint bear festival. Each contracting lineage had to provide a minimum of one, better two or three bears, which were fed to the state of utmost obesity. Each lineage involved also provided racing dogs. Everyone joined in games, races, duelling with staffs and other ritual pastimes associated with the bear festival. The bear in this case was then killed by members of the fusing lineages or by a chosen old man who "says the word to the bear." All members of the two lineages attended and all ate the bear meat.t The bones were divided among the eldest and most honorable members of the com- mon feast. The shoulder and pelvic bones had the greatest importance. After the meat and bones were divided, khlai nivukh pronounced the ritual formula: "To the children of two lineages, to the lineages, to the girls, to the women, I say 'Now we are one flesh, we are becoming one blood"1 and the other khlai nivukh responded: "Lineage speaks thus: each woman is my child (daughter), each man is my child (son), woman - is my elder sister, my sister. Now you, comrade, are called sister, so are you. I am the elder brother and will be the younger brother. ..." The concludine oart of the formula *It was this part of the feast from which Shrenk and, on another occasion, his collaborators were tactfully but firmly barred. **See illustrations. Shrenk states that the toad image is pasted on the outside of the dwelling dur- ing the bear festival and may be of either male (single) or female (double) type. tSymbolic implication of communion with the common ancestor is clear here.</page><page sequence="102">102 Arctic Anthropology X-l went as follows: "Of course, this is so. At great enterprise have we labored, you helped us, we helped you; we formed a lineage and thus we shall be a lineage" (Shternberg, 1933:297-299). The ceremony concluded with instructions to the man who divided the bear meat to give out portions to all according to kinship and age status. The procedure followed in the adoption of in- dividuals was not quite so elaborate, but it, too, involved the sacrifice of a bear and common con- sumption of its meat. The adoption was discussed, absence of legal obstacles made certain, and the person to be adopted provided his new lineage with a bear, delivering it in front of respected witnesses to the most important man of the lineage. Then, in the adoptee's absence, a lineage meeting or coun- cil was held and, if adoption was agreed on, the adoptee gave dogs to his new kinsmen. A bear feast was then held. During the ritual he was addressed by the proper kinship term and so ad- dressed others. As a concluding act, the newly adopted person received a portion of the fire- making flint, but apparently not of the sacred lineage flint used in ritual (Shternberg, 1933:298). Finally, I shall describe, once again following Shternberg (1893:24-25; 1904b:II:23; 111:82-83), the ritual reversal following death of a kinsman from wounds inflicted by a bear or killed in a fight with a bear. In such cases the bear was treated as an alien, a member of an unrelated lineage, and vengeance, blood price, was exacted from the bear's "lineage." That is, if the real culprit was not apprehended in a pursuit which started as soon as the news of the accident reached the kinsmen, they killed any bear they met and preferably, if the rule were strictly applied, three. As mentioned in the section dealing with death rites, if the acci- dent occurred in the forest during the bear hunt and the bear was killed on the spot, the body of the human victim was brought into the village astride the bear carcass. The latter did not receive any of the customary signs of honor. On the contrary, it was subjected to all sorts of insults and abuse, while the virtues of the dead man were extolled. The bear carcass was not brought into the settle- ment, but a fire was made near the enclosure where the victim was being interred. This fire was laid in a long line and the kinsmen seated on both sides of it roasted the bear meat - a sacrilegeous action in other contexts. They evidenced immense disgust at the taste of the meat and threw it and the bones, usually so reverently placed and preserved in the lezang, on the ground. Verbal abuse accompanied the actions. I quote from Shternberg: Along both sides of the long uninterrupted fire the kinsmen sit down with pieces of bear meat in their hands. Each cuts the meat in thin strips and flips it from the knife point across the fire to be caught on another knifetip. Then the piece is slowly roasted (the greatest insult to the bear, whose meat may only be boiled); then, with a show of repugnance, they bite off a piece and throw away with contempt the rest, while under usual circumstances it is con- sidered a sin to drop even the smallest piece of bone on the ground. After this procedure of the vengeance of extreme finesse, begins a feast with sacrificial offerings to the Master of the Mountain/ Forest and to the dead person. First, they throw into the fire a burning piece of tinder, then various items of food. During the night two men stand guard at the enclosure armed with spears in case the bear soul decided on vengeance. The guardsmen are convinced that they can hear the dead cry out: "Oh, the bear! " and in the morning there is blood on the spear points. . . . With this memorial feast peace is estab- lished between the mountain people and the lineage of the deceased. The latter has been accepted and will live to the deepest age in the lineage of the mountain people, and his kinsmen for three generations twice a year, in winter and in summer, will offer sacrifices partly to the Master of the Mountain/Forest, partly to the now divine kinsman.. . (1904b:II:83). I conclude that the Nivkh ritual of the double sacrifice, of the bear and the dogs, in the same con- text is the symbolic expression of the unity of kins- men through time and across the chasm of death. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL APPENDIX Though the following bibliography is extensive and additional works either dealing with Nivkh cul- ture and society or at least mentioning them are available, the quality of the sources is far from uni- form. A few travel accounts, notably that by Hawes (1904) and Ravenstein (1860) contain accurate and valuable material. By and large, observations made by travellers appear rather superficial but are by no means uninfluential. For example, it has been a puzzle to me why Karl Bouda (I960) compared the Nivkh language to languages of the Caucasus. Fol- lowing up a footnote in Shrenk, I found that Strahlen- berg (1738, reprinted in 1970) mentions the Kilani, who, in his words, "are a People living in Eastern Tartary, about the Mouth of the River Amur," and he attributes a relationship between these people and the "Avari, whom, in the thirteenth Century, the</page><page sequence="103">Black: The Nivkh 203 Tartar Mangu-Chan, then King of Persia, took from between the Caspian and the Black Sea, and sent to Kitay, or China, to the Great Chan, to make Arms" (p. 394). In the topical references to be given below I shall refer primarily to the ethnographic works. We owe our knowledge of the material culture of the Nivkh to Shrenk, who led a scientific expedition in the years 1854-1856 to the Amur and Sakhalin, immediately following the Russian penetration of that area. His work was published first in German in four volumes , 1881-1895. Vol. Ill, consisting of two books and a separate linguistic supplement in which Wilhelm Grube analyzed data collected by Shrenk and Slehn, by Nivkh dialects, deals pri- marily with ethnographic data. Vols. I and II, en- titled Zoology , deal with fauna and flora of the region; Vol. IV, entitled Meteorology , deals with climate. Some ethnographic data are scattered throughout. Vol. Ill has been published in Russian under the title Ob Inorodtsakh Amurskogo Kraia , in three parts: I (1883) - dealing with the history, geography and physical anthropology of the native population; II (1899) - devoted to technology ("Principal Conditions and Features of External Life"); III (1903) - dealing with social organization and religious beliefs; it includes some field notes pertaining to ritual and ritual objects. The material is accurate and detailed, except in part III, as Shrenk himself states, since he could not overcome the linguistic barrier and also because he believed that the Nivkh were less than candid with him. In fact, he mentions that, understanding the language better than speaking it, he overheard the Nivkh planning what kind of information to give in answer to his questions and discussing the object of these and the possible effects his work might have on their lives. What he himself observed has been confirmed in most essentials by subsequent inves- tigators. Shrenk *s approach is comparative: while the main concentration is on Nivkh culture, he com- pares aspects thereof with the culture of surround- ing peoples and points out similarities and differ- ences. On this basis, he concluded that the Nivkh may be considered a cultural and linguistic isolate, and, to describe their position, coined the term "Palaeoasiatic. " The fundamental work on social structure and organization of the Nivkh is that of Shternberg. This has been utilized to the utmost in the present survey. His first report appeared in 1893 under the title Sakhalinskie giliaki (The Gilyak of Sakhalin) and drew the outline of their culture and social structure, kinship terminology and marriage pattern. He published next in the Far East (No. 2:165 and 2:166 in Jakobson et al., 1957) and in 1904 his ethnographic monograph Gilyakiin Etnograficheskoe Obozrenie in three sections appeared (Nos. 1, 2 and 4 - for pagination see bibliography). In this work he gave a detailed account of the marriage system, the function of the agnatic lineage, an analysis of matrilateral cross cousin alliance and kinship terminology, as well as the legal and re- ligious system of an acephalous society. There- after, until his death, he published numerous articles on the Nivkh, Ainu and other peoples of the Amur region. He agreed to contribute to the Jesup North Pacific Expedition Reports and wrote the Social Organization of the Gilyak. This was scheduled for publication as a volume of the above mentioned series, in the Memoirs of the American Museum of Natural History, but for various reasons it never appeared in print. Shternberg died in 1927. In 1941 Boas, in whose possession the manuscript had been, deposited it in the archives of the Amer- ican Museum of Natural History. The manuscript has been compared, at Boas1 request, with the work of the same title which appeared in 1933 in Kha- barovsk in Russian by Roman Jakobson, who estab- lished the correspondence between the manuscript chapters and those of the sections of the 1933 work. A copy of Jakobson's statement of correspondence is also on file in the archives of the museum. I contacted Jakobson and in a telephone conversation he stated that he does not now remember if the texts were identical or "substantially the same." He is inclined to think that it was "substantially the same." I shall note here that Jakobson listed some manuscript chapters as corresponding to certain chapters of the section "Social Organization of the Gilyak" in the 1933 work and others to that in Gilyaki. The Shternberg 1933 title is a compendium of Shternberg 's work, some of it reprinted from pub- lished materials, some new materials added, and it also contains some valuable field notes. Below follows the breakdown: pp. 1-10: Classification of the population of the Amur region (as far as I know not previously published) pp. 11-128: Reprint of Giliaki , 1904b pp. 129-284: Social Organization of the Gilyak - previously unpublished data and detailed analysis of prescriptive matrilateral cross cousin marriage system, comparison with marriage systems of Australian aborigines as described by Spencer and Gillen, functional explanation of avoidance rules and analysis of interpersonal tensions and mechanisms for resolution which he saw as dependent variables of the marriage system. Opposed to the struc- tural level of analysis is the "real life" level - wherein Shternberg vividly describes how in- dividuals adjust to or try to beat the system. pp. 205-319: Separate Materials Pertaining to</page><page sequence="104">104 Arctic Anthropology X-l the Ethnography of the Amur Gilyak: edited but nevertheless raw field data, of great in- terest. pp. 320-346: Separate Materials Pertaining to the Ethnography of the Sakhalin Gilyak : same; both of these last sections contain some folklore material and the last section contains very interesting descriptions of some Gilyak games. pp. 347-388: reprint of Shternberg, 1893, Sakhalin- skie Giliaki pp. 389 ff.: deals with the non-Nivkh people of the region: Orochi of the Tartar Strait, material pertaining to Negidal, Gold (Nanai), Ainu, etc. The original typescript, intended as part of the Jesup North Pacific Expedition Reports, is in the archives of the American Museum of Natural History, but in deplorable condition. The paper crumbles to the touch and any use of the manuscript, specifically for comparison with the text published in Russian in 1933 is, at this time, impossible for this reason. I sincerely hope that measures have been taken, since the time that I examined the manuscript two years ago, to preserve it from disintegration. Contemporary anthropologists working on the Nivkh problem are E. A. Kreinovich, a student of Shternberg 's to whose memory he dedicated his first publication (1929) on Nivkh cosmology. Kreinovich's contribution is varied. He has added significantly to the understanding of the Nivkh re- ligious system through his examination of beliefs and rituals connected with the seal hunt and dog keeping, as well as devoting a special publication to the ideology of birth and death. Kreinovich was instrumental in initiating linguistic studies of the Nivkh language and his contribution is the basis on which subsequent investigators have built. Pan- filov gave us the complete grammar of a Nivkh dia- lect. A. V. Smolyak (Smoliak) and Ch. M. Taksami, himself a Nivkh, devote most of their work to con- temporary conditions and problems of change. However, in their work they refer to pre-existing conditions by way of comparison and Taksami especially adds to our knowledge of Nivkh rituals and the conceptual schema underlying them. Close reading of the works of these authors is required, however, to cull out the material pertaining to the ethnographic present. Zolotarev, of whose work I was able to obtain only one publication for which he was attacked (in the same issue), as he ques- tioned indirectly the existence of group marriage as defined by Engels, was interested in the social organization and his re-study confirmed the marriage network as analyzed by Shternberg, but gave us specific data on one village (1933). His eth- nography, in the archives in the USSR, remains in- accessible. However, it formed the basis for the section on the Nivkh in Peoples of Siberia (Levin and Potapov, 1956, English translation by Dunn, 1964). All data presented by these authors are precise and well documented, though one may disagree with aspects of their analysis. Topical Index 1.
