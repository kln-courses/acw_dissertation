<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mick McAllister Weber State College "Wolf That I Am . . Animal Symbology in Lord Grizzly and Scarlet Plume No reader of The Buckskin Man Tales could fail to notice the neat symmetry of action and symbol in Lord Grizzly and Scarlet Plume . In the first, a white man has his baptism into the American wilderness and emerges radically changed by his experience; in the second, a white woman, Judith Raveling, suffers a similar baptism and transformation. Among the symmetries of the works are a set of parallel incidents: the pursuit of each of the protagonists - Hugh by the "hant bear" that fol- lows him down the White River, Judith by the Yankton in a wolfskin who shadows her across the Minnesota prairies. Frederick Manfred's choice of a key animal symbol for each novel is an important part of the thematic fabric of the series as a whole. Bear and wolf : the nature of the beast explicates a theme in each book. Most readers are familiar with traditional symbolic meanings for bear and wolf, either European or Indian or both, and those symbolic meanings are pertinent both to Lord Grizzly and Scarlet Plume and to the novels that precede and follow them. Manfred warns us to look for such mean- ings in Lord Grizzly when he has Major Henry describe the religious sig- nificance of the bear in Plains Indian cultures: "They think the grizzly some sort of god. One tribe I have in mind, when they need food in the winter, go hunt out the bear and bring him the best food they have left, and bow to him, and ask him to forgive them for what they are about to do, saying they know he</page><page sequence="2">22 Western American Literature is their friend, saying they know he wants to live up to his name as the giver of life, saying they know he wants to die for them." ( 73) 1 American bear folklore fills the novel, especially the early part, before the attack on Hugh. Throughout, we are given bear lore - in the stories told by the mountain men and Indians, in the behavior of the bears themselves. The nature of the bear is central to the meaning of Lord Grizzly - just as the nature of the whale is to Moby Dick - especially certain aspects of its social behavior. The bear is a solitary creature, a classic loner ; only the female is ever likely to be accompanied, and she only by cubs. The male has no parental function beyond impregnating the female: none of the raising, training, feeding, punishing of the cub is done by the male. The male bear, like Hugh, can't father and like Hugh, he has no solid male bonds either - no community of bulls, like the bison, no artificial pack of unmated males, such as wolves will create for socialization and the exigencies of pack hunting. Throughout Lord Grizzly , we are reminded of "Old Ephe's" hermit nature, and throughout the book Hugh's great spiritual conflict revolves around his growing recognition that he can no more be a bear that he can be an Esau. Esau is the Indian, the red man, the hunter. Hugh in the fur hide of his she-rip nemesis is a Jacob in disguise - the self-reliant, anti-social, self-nucleate white man, needing nobody, he claims, better off alone than on the riverboat the Rees ambush, than in the party of trappers slaugh- tered on the North Platte, than with the other hunters who might have saved him from the mother grizzly who provides a savage commentary on his solitary independence. Hugh could be a bear, if that were what he wanted; did he truly desire it, he could adopt the hermitage solitude of the Elijah-like medicine beast, but clearly that choice conflicts with his values. He wants - demands - loyalty from his fellows, loyalty no bear would ask of another. He longs for community just as the wolf needs his pack; he weeps with joy and sentiment when he finds even the poor companionship of an old Ree woman dying abandoned on the plains. The Plains Indians honored and emulated many of the animals in their richly populated natural environment. Bison, bear, wolf and eagle each represented a particular wisdom. The bear is the medicine beast, References to The Buckskin Man Tales, incorporated in the text, are to the 1980 reprint in five volumes by the Gregg Press.

His solitude is the hermit's, the holy man's - the privacy of permanent introspection, the loneliness of the endless vision quest. Hugh is an old man, but no philosopher or visionary, no hermit. His flight from society is not a positive flight to the world of the spirit but a negative flight from demanding responsibilities. He is not the priest seeking private, holy mountaintops where gods speak from thunder, but a boy who won't grow up, a Huck Finn who's "lit out for the territories," a child demanding fealties he will not reciprocate. Having abandoned his natural sons, he demands filial loyalty from Jim and Fitz. Turning his back on social obli- gations, he expects his fellows to band around him. And given back the same meagre loyalty he gave them, he adopts an absolute selfishness which sees the whole universe focused - for help or hindrance - upon himself. "Old Ephe's" blessing, bestowed at a critical moment in Hugh's crawl back to civilization, is no confirmation of Hugh's entry into the fellowship of nature. When the bear cats the maggots from Hugh's wounds, it has mistaken him just as Isaac mistook his thieving son Jacob. It has taken him for a dead bear. What blessing is given the dead? Hugh has chosen either the wrong totem or the wrong course of life for his chosen totem: something out of sync. It is the nature of man to bond, mate, and then father his children as the wolf fathers pups. For all his resistance to these imperatives, something in Hugh is drawn to them, some muley hankering after colts. He has the potential, after his forced intimacy with the landscape and with his soul - during the crawl and his second and third lone treks - to grow into a grey ghost of the spirit, Lord Grizzly, patriarch of a new white male covenant with the wilderness. Instead, when he chooses to forgive, he chooses the other path: he acknowledges his need for "hant companyeros," ghost companions for a social beast. He accepts his wolfishness. In Lord Grizzly the bear is at once the spirit of the wilderness and the emblem of a certain potential accommodation between white man and American land. In Scarlet Plume , the grizzly is replaced by the wolf as central symbolic creature of The Buckskin Man Tales. From the horri- fying image of the crucified wolf that signals the beginning of the violence, to the wolfskin that Scarlet Plume adopts as a disguise while he follows Judith, to the "Werewolf women" who attack the Indian prisoners pass- ing through New Ulm, the wolf is the totem of this book, present in fact, image, or metaphor on nearly every page.</page><page sequence="4">24 Western American Literature In the massacre sequence at the beginning of the novel, the wolf and the Indian are equated. The Indians will kill the white man as wolves kill rabbits (SP, 25) ; they range around the settlers "like a pack of wolves" (30) ; their battlecries are "wolfish barks" (52) ; one attacks like "a lean wolf" (53). They are perceived at the worst moment of the massacre as "worse than wolves even" (55). The white settlers of Skywater voice the common view of the wolf : it is a cowardly, ravening monster - symbol of the savage wild. For the Indian as well, the wolf is an important, threatening force to be reckoned with, but not an incarnate evil. In Scarlet Plume , Indian dead are raised on scaffolds "to save them from the wolves" (86) ; and people left alone in the wilderness can expect the wolves to find and eat them (93, 94, 1 26) . A bad wife is like "a crazed she- wolf" (120). But the Indian view is more rounded than the white man's. The Yanktons have learned from the wolf how to hunt, using the wolf's trick to lure antelope into traps, driving the buffalo pack-style. The camp dogs are part wolf. The tribe's negative feelings about wolves are never expressed as blind, irrational horror, but always in terms reflecting a healthy respect for the power of the wild. Their image of the wolf is neither sentimental nor irrational. And their picture is the one Manfred chooses to endorse. Never do we see any wolf commit aggression against a human - against anything, for that matter - despite all the talk of sav- age hunters and the long section of the narrative when Judith believes (as we do on first reading) that she is being stalked by a wolf. It is in a wolfskin that Scarlet Plume pursues Judith as she flees Whitebone's camp - not to attack her, not even to capture her and return her to the village, only to protect her from Mad Bear and the other dangers she will face crossing the land alone. He takes the skin she slept in at the deserted Sioux Falls and follows her like a grey wolf. Once they are together, she readopts this skin she had become so enamoured of dur- ing the few days she rested in the abandoned village of Sioux Falls, and at times, alone with her lover at Lost Timber, she wears nothing else. When Mad Bear and Bone Gnawer come nosing about, it is under the wolfskin, not the recently acquired deerskin, that Scarlet Plume hides her from the Santees, the same wolfskin that serves as bed for their lovemaking. Later they use it to cover the Codman children when they find the two boys wandering near Skywater. Back among the whites, the skin is replaced with "a smelly red and black horse blanket" (330).</page><page sequence="5">Mick McAllister 25 Since the wolf is the key symbol in the novel, it would be wise to examine the real wolves, so seldom visible in the book. The first one we see sets the tone for the rest: it sits on a low mound near Judith's house, sunning itself and lolling its tongue as if it were laughing (4). The beast is the very image of contented innocence. Later, during the buffalo hunt, the picture is repeated. Two scout wolves trailing the buffalo observe the Yanktons' surround and, "laughing with long red tongues" (149), they slip away. Only once more in the book does a free and living wolf appear - ■ part of a triptych of sexual images. The occasion is the Yanktons' ' 'Virgin Feast." On one edge of the feast are three sleazy boys who try to besmirch the celebrant's honor. On the other side of the camp, noticed only by Judith, is the flirtation between a village dog and a male wolf. The bitch frolics a bit ; the male approaches her. At first, Judith thinks the wolf intends to attack the dog, then she is disgusted when he "pumps her out of sight into the bushes" (188). Like the scene between the hen and rooster that so offended her at Sky- water before the massacre, this public mating reminds Judith of basic animal lust, which she is "nauseated" by (34). Like the yielding hen she despised before, the dog is a willing love-mate, even initiating her loveplay with the wolf. Judith's disgust remains un tempered by the many experi- ences she has after the Skywater massacre; she has far to go emotionally, even this late in the novel, before she can throw herself lasciviously at Scarlet Plume near Lost Timber. There is one other real wolf in the novel, the one no reader is ever likely to forget - Crydenwise's victim. It should not be forgotten, in the context of all the horrors that fill the next fifty pages of the novel. The first victim whose death we observe directly is an innocent beast - innocent in the Blakean sense, at least - and just as sadistically tortured and murdered as any white sufferer to come. Even one who believes that human suffering is of greater significance than animal cannot help but respond with sympa- thetic horror at the picture of the crucified wolf. At this point in the narrative, Henry Christians has been killed - neatly, with one arrow through the heart. Judith is out hunting for her daughter and nephews, who, she fears, are being tortured even at that moment. Her nightmare reveries are broken by a horrifying scream. When she rushes to investi- gate, expecting to find her mutilated child, she comes upon Crydenwise skinning a screaming timber wolf. Manfred spares us no detail of the sight: the raw look of the beast's naked muscles as it shivers and jerks,</page><page sequence="6">26 Western American Literature crucified on a wooden "X" frame, its "glistening body muscles" (13) clutching spasmodically while the animal's shrieks of agony pierce the clearing. Crydenwise is "teaching" the wolf not to steal calves. Crydenwise had brought a pregnant cow with him from Ohio, and a wolf - he seems somehow certain it was this one - killed the cow and ate the fetal calves, twin bulls. While Crydenwise finishes his grim lesson, Judith reports to him that she has found Henry Christians dead. At the moment she finishes speaking, while Crydenwise stares at her aghast, the wolf dies "on its crude cross." If there is a lesson to be learned from the scene, it is not about stealing calves, it is about the bestiality of Crydenwise and the foolishness of any man unable to comprehend and accept the laws of the wilderness. Crydenwise assumes that wolves should not hunt, should respect his private property, adapting their nature to accommodate his intrusion on their territory, and then he rationalizes - however ironically - that the hideous torture he is inflicting on this particular wolf is something other than an expression of sheer, vengeful sadism, as barbaric and vicious as any behavior of wolf or wild Indian. Twice he uses the phrase "teach him" to describe what he is doing to the wolf. The use of "teach" implies not so much irony as one of the more perverted meanings we have given the word - to punish. To gloss over his own vindictiveness, unable to admit his own savagery even to himself, Crydenwise must invoke some biblical concept of justice, some notion of "rehabilitation" so incongruous as to seem nearly insane. The wolf learns nothing, of course, and is denied even the chance to die well. It is Crydenwise who must learn (though, in an ironic parallel to the wolf, he is denied that opportunity) ; it is he who serves as primary spokesman for the traditional frontier view of Indian and wolf alike. The two "wild devils," wolf and Indian - no respecters of John Locke's moral perspective - are equally undomes- ticable, completely incompatible with civilization : "Ever try to domesticate a wolf?" Crydenwise said. "Try it some time and see what you get. I know. A wolfll snap at any- thing that comes near him even after he gets used to livin' with you. Same thing goes fer a red devil." (43) It is a point of view Barry Lopez spent a chapter of his Of Wolves and Men analyzing. Lopez covers the issues so well that I will refer the reader to that chapter, "The Beast of Waste and Desolation," and merely</page><page sequence="7">Mick McAllister 27 summarize his main points here.2 Tracing our hatred of wolves back to medieval bestiaries, he describes the connection in the European mind between the wolf and the very concept of wilderness. It is wilderness, Lopez argues - as Frederick W. Turner III would argue a few years later from a slightly different perspective in Beyond Geography - that we truly fear and hate : the chaos of the wild. The wolf - wild outlaw cousin of our civilized, tamed, and servile "best friend" - and the "wild man" indigenous to the uncivilized American land, became interchangeable ideas in the minds of the New Englander, then the Westerner, as agents and symbols of the Christian Devil. Seeing Satanic allegiances in each, we condemned their behaviors in that prejudging light. The wolf learned quickly to avoid a man with a gun : the white man took this as a sign of cowardice rather than wisdom. Deer hunters would report on the one hand the savagery of the wolf - describing attacks upon "defenseless deer" and upon men foolish enough to expose themselves to such attacks - and on the other they would tell of incidents when "cowardly" wolves stood by barking ineffectually while their pups were stolen from under their very noses. The Indian too was regarded as a brutal coward - eager to injure the defenseless, equally eager to avoid anyone capable of fighting back. No two creatures have been more thoroughly invested with the idea of wilderness in all its most frightening aspects than the wolf and the Indian. The connection between wolf and Indian was established in the white mind, and recorded in white literature as far back as Cotton Mather. Ironically, the Indian also imagined a connection between the wolf and himself, but for utterly different reasons. For the Plains tribes especially, the wolf was the ideal creature to emulate - good hunter and fighter, superb tracker, a tribally oriented family creature, quick to learn and adapt. Indian folklore emphasizes these positive qualities of the wolf, often in contrast to canine servility. When the white is "wolfish," he imitates not the natural beast but the nightmarish invention of his id. In Scarlet Plume , this is the signifi- cance of the wolfish metaphors all through the description of the attack by New Ulm's "Werewolf women" (354) on the Sioux captives headed for execution in Mankato. The wolf itself is a neutral creature, neither hateful nor admirable, merely a normal, dangerous part of the whole landscape, 2See Barry Holstun Lopez, Of Wolves and Men (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1978), pp. 137 ff.</page><page sequence="8">28 Western American Literature no more evil than fire or lightning - a bit more to be feared, but feared because its good is not the good of the people, any more than the people's good is that of the deer and buffalo. There is in this view none of the anthropomorphic silliness that sees the wolf's hunting as a morality play with the deer as poor, defenseless Bambi and the wolf as fiendish evil in black baggy pants and a trepanned top hat. Scarlet Plume himself describes and demonstrates this view of the hunter, shocking Judith by playing on a deer's maternal instincts. Imitating the sound of a frightened fawn, he lures the sympathetic doe near enough for a sure shot. Judith is scandalized, moved by a sense of what she calls fair play. Scarlet Plume is unabashed. They needed the meat. To emphasize the naturalness of the kill, Manfred includes a scene parallel to the skinning of the wolf : Scarlet Plume strings the deer's corpse up to a tree and lays back the hide with neat precision, making the flesh appear not in tortured spasms but "as if with the motion of birthing" ( 257 ) . He butchers the meat efficiently, without wasted motion, without leaving any usable parts aside. Finally he prays over the body, asking its forgiveness, vowing to practice similar economy in all his future hunting. When Judith protests that he preyed on a mother's love, he argues that the deer understands the meaning of the hunt, that he and the deer are cousins and have a compact to help each other. When Judith pushes his argument to the logical extreme - what if the deer could eat him? - he replies that if it were so, he would accept it. He carries her own logic even a step further, remarking that the white man will eventually consume the Indian even as the Indian consumes the deer, and in the final pages of the book he demonstrates the sincerity of his resignation by refusing to resist his own inevitable death at the hands of the whites, placing dignity and identity above personal safety. It is no accident that in a book about the white woman's attempt to come to terms with the meaning of the wilderness, the wolf replaces the bear as symbol of that wilderness. For Hugh, solitary and self-contained, the bear seems a natural symbol. The white man likes to think of himself as bearlike - an individual, self-reliant, committed to personal freedom, valuing self above community. The woman, the Indian, and the wolf share one characteristic antithetical to that male idealization - a strong sense of the value of the community, of family. The wolf is a creature of communal consciousness who places the needs of the group above personal concerns. Like a Plains Indian community, a wolf pack is organized</page><page sequence="9">Mick McAllister 29 loosely around a leader couple, a male and female of great charisma, then less loosely around the pups, the children whose welfare is the first concern of parents, uncles, cousins. When Scarlet Plume follows Judith wearing the stolen wolfskin, he is costumed in a racial totem. During their idyll at Lost Timber, Judith herself adopts the wolfskin, symbolic of her partial acceptance of the natural relationship of mates. Still later, the wolfskin bestows a kind of baptism into the generating family when the two adults use it to cover and protect the Codman boys. Judith's failure to under- stand the essential need for community leaves her baffled by Scarlet Plume's unwillingness to run away with her, a dark Adam with his pale, pregnant Eve and two towhead boys. The pop historian's hoary claim that civilization comes with the woman, not the man, is a generalization that carried a great weight of truth in the record of American expansion, and even greater truth in the literary history of that expanding western movement as it appears in The Buckskin Man Tales. It is with the arrival of white women that communi- ties of white culture begin to appear in the tales; it is the women, not the men, who are the tamers of Deadwood in King of Spades . Judith is a communal person, a mother, teacher, city person, with the same civilized values as Hugh's "she-rip" Pennsylvania wife. And she is also a Euro- american and therefore shares the individualistic sensibilities of the Euro- american mind. She, Scarlet Plume and the two boys together would make a family of precisely the same size and shape as Hugh's in Pennsyl- vania. Hugh flees the family to be alone or, at best, to be "one of the boys." Scarlet Plume rejects a similar arrangement because he needs the larger community as a context for himself and his family. A "little nest way out in the West" is not for him, even with a wife and children he loves. Hugh's accommodation with the wilderness experience must take the form of a personal recognition and growth, the ability to accept his individual relationship with the land and its spirit. For Judith, the accom- modation must include family. She will have children; she is pregnant when she vanishes at the end of the novel, carrying Scarlet Plume's child. She defines herself by relationships ("Without love I am nothing") rather than by identity. Without understanding it, yet she is not radically dif- ferent from Scarlet Plume, who goes to his death because he has been cut off from most of his defining relationships and - cut off - must wither and die. He has sinned against the community spirit by first rescuing and then becoming the lover of the white woman, and it is a sin that makes</page><page sequence="10">30 Western American Literature him tragically unfit for Yankton life. A communal man, the final tragedy is that he must die with only his personal identity intact. This interplay of personal and group identity Manfred accentuates with a number of devices as the book draws to a close. Scarlet Plume is absorbed into a nameless crowd of men who were victims of the largest mass execution in American history. He may have died merely because a pardon intended for him was given to another man named "Red Feather," identity confused and lost in a bureaucratic bungle. Going to his death, he swallows his own red honor feather when told he cannot wear it under his blindfold. At the moment of death, he is merely one of thirty-eight foul-diapered, skew-necked bodies hanging from gibbets; he may be the one who fell from a broken noose, may not be. He is finally nothing more or less than his fellows - at once a sad dissolution of his personal identity and an appropriate fate, fitting to a man whose self was ultimately less important to him than his social identity. If we see The Buckskin Man Tales as a working out of the conflict not only between man and nature, white and Indian, male and female, but also that between individualism and socialization, then the parallels between Lord Grizzly and Scarlet Plume , paired centerpiece and fulcrum of the series, are even more striking. There is first the contrast of Hugh Glass and Scarlet Plume : Hugh makes a virtue bordering on mania of his self-reliant individualism, and learns that he is a social creature, dependent upon his fellow men, hungry for the company of both male and female, craving fatherhood, forced to accept the necessity of his social obligations. Scarlet Plume is the ideal man, pure wolf : father, lover and son, destroyed because of a tragic con- flict between his personal feelings of love for his mate and the pull of communal imperatives. Unable to deny his wolfish nature, to adopt the nuclear solitude of the puma, he walks into his death. Parallel to this contrast is that between Judith and Hugh : the moun- tain man is old, past the proper age for parenting, ready to become - were he worthy - an Odin-like patriarch for a new order, a fellowship of hunters and hunted mimicking the Indian's integration with nature rather than the imported idea of man's god-given dominion over all other life. But he is unequal to the demands of this apotheosis. Judith, too, has the opportunity to begin a new order, a synthesis of white and Indian. Young, healthy, initiated painfully but wholly into Indian life, she could be mother to the golden race. Her failure is less complete than Hugh's. When</page><page sequence="11">Mick McAllister 3 1 she flees Camp Release, pregnant with the child who could become Erden Aldridge fourteen years later in the Black Hills haven of King of Spades , she is flawed only by her inability to understand fully that essential ele- ment of Indian life, community. She cannot accept Scarlet Plume's abso- lute commitment to his tribe; his refusal to adopt a nuclear existence with her, she regards as whimsical caprice, then as masculine willfulness, rather than as an inviolable given of his nature. Not man into wolf, as the Werewolf women of New Ulm become when they fall like ravening beasts on defenseless Sioux prisoners; when, in their frenzy, they destroy the gentle Indian woman who saved their holy book for them, thinking she had the only copy in existence. Not man becoming wolf, but man accepting his wolfishness in all its varied implica- tions for good or ill, is a theme of The Buckskin Man Tales, and there is no better image of our failure to do so than the sudden, offhand moment at the beginning of Riders of Judgment when Cain Hammett, tainted spiritual grandson of Judith and Scarlet Plume, potential inheritor (if by default) of the domain of Conquering Horse, Redbird, Whitebone, last remnant of the half-wild spirit Hugh Glass nearly adopted, symbolic natural child of golden Erden Aldridge and English Earl Ransom - absent-mindedly unscabbards his rifle to shoot at a patch of grey he takes for a wolf. It would have been the last wolf in all the books, and he would have killed it for target practice because, he muses, he "felt like shooting" (RJ, 34) . But the grey is just dead wood; there's nothing there to kill.</page></plain_text>
