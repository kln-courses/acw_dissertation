American Landscape: Changing Concepts of the Sublime BY BARBARA NOVAK Barbara Novak is Chairman of the Department of Art History at Barnard College and Professor of Art History at Barnard and Columbia University. She is the author of American Paint- ing of the Nineteenth Century. N THE LITERATURE of landscape painting, the word "sublime" has played a suit- ably "exalted" role. Its venerable history has been carefully documented in such studies as Monk's The Sublime,l and the characteristics it acquired in the late eighteenth century have generally stood for its interpretation. There is much evidence, however, that the word, already loaded with meaning, took on additional baggage in the nineteenth century. By the mid-century, we can speak of several interpretations of the sublime, so that the original concept, which more or less maintained its traditional meaning, existed side by side with its offspring. The connotations of these later sublimes not only alter the original meaning of the word, but affect our understanding of landscape attitudes in mid-nineteenth century America. Thus, it is perhaps worth devoting a short note to the changing concepts of the sublime in relation to nineteenth century landscape painting. Though the older sublime has been so frequently described that reiteration of its characteristics seems superfluous, it is important for our purposes to outline them again. The late eighteenth century sublime, interpreted largely in terms of Burke's definition, was associated with fear, gloom and majesty. Majesty had to do with scale and size, particularly exemplified, of course, by mountain scenery. 1. Samuel H. Monk, The Sublime, Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor Pa- perbacks, 1960.

Though this reaction provoked intimations of infinity and thus of deity and the divine,2 it was an awesome and overwhelming divinity, dwarfing the observer who, though he aspired to transcendence, seems rarely to have for- gotten his own insignificance. Such humility magnified awe. As Mrs. Radcliffe put it, in The Italian: Here, gazing upon the stupendous imagery around her, looking, as it were, beyond the awful veil which obscures the features of Deity, and conceals Him from the eyes of His creatures, dwelling as with a present God in the midst of His sublime works; with a mind thus elevated, how insignificant would appear to her the transactions, and the sufferings of this world! How poor the boasted power of man, when the fall of a single cliff from those mountains would with ease destroy thousands of his race assembled on the plains below.3 Though silence, too, was sometimes part of the older sublime, it was generally suspenseful, attended by terror and dread, and often relieved by the uproar of cataracts, earthquakes, fires, storms, thunder, volcanoes: "Nothing is more sub- lime than mighty power and strength. A stream that runs within its banks is a beautiful object; but when it rushes down with the impetuosity and noise of a torrent, it becomes a sublime one."4 The eighteenth-century interest in Longinus, as Monk pointed out, took up his suggestion that "Nature impels us to admire not a small river 'that ministers to our necessities,' but the Nile, the Ister [Danube] and the Rhine; likewise the sun and the stars 'surprise' us, and Aetna in eruption commands our wonder."5 Even Kant, who transferred the sublime from the object to a subjective state of mind, associated sublimity with natural cataclysms-lightning, storms, moun- tains, waterfalls. Thus, even in the hands of the philosopher who influenced so much transcen- dental idealism, the sublime was the result of contact with overwhelming natural energies. Nature was often conceived of as wild and savage, coinciding with the vogue for Ossian's poetry, and for Salvator's landscapes. And the connection of the sublime with the picturesque, with pictures (Gilpin speaks of picturesque sublimity and picturesque beauty), opens the door to the other pictorial hero of the moment, Claude, who was of course, because of his calm repose, put forward as an example of the beautiful in contrast to Salvator's sublimity. This older romantic-Gothic sublime endured well into the nineteenth century in American landscape painting. It was nourished, as a concept and a vision, first by the uncultivated wilderness of the East, then by the penetration of the majestic 2. Ernest Tuveson has stressed the importance of the divine in the "natural sublime" of the 17th century. But it is significant for my hypothesis that Deity here is associated with vast- ness of space, and that "the sublime of nature" is characterized as "an aesthetic which set up as supreme criteria the qualities of immensity, unlimitedness, and awe." See Ernest Tuve- son, "Space, Deity and the 'Natural Sublime,'" Modern Language Quarterly, vol. 12, March 1951, No. 1, p. 20-38 (p. 32). 3.

We can recognize many of its characteristics in the more am- bitious works of the Hudson River School, which often drew on the conventions of Claude and on the moods of Salvator. Church's adventures in South America relate in active energy and noisy cataclysm to the older sublime. Thus, in his diary of 1857 in Ecuador, he writes of his journey to the volcano Sangay (July 10): "Rocks began to crop out of the fields and as we progressed, the peaks became more craggy and wild. An extraordinary stillness struck me which was heightened by the rapid movements of the clouds about the mountain tops-we are very near them now. In addition to these was the rolling of the smoke from burning paramo grass swept by a high wind ..."' He continues on July 11: "I knew I could get no view of (Sangay) that night without a scramble, and as there was still a couple of hours of daylight I grasped my sketch book and commenced ascending the hill which rose between us and the Volcano. The exer- tion of working my way through the tangled grass was tremendous. I toiled and toiled while every little eminence which I gained revealed still more elevated ones above, but my perseverance was rewarded finally, and I planted my feet on the summit. Dense clouds hung over the mountain tops everywhere, and I looked in vain for a glimpse of Sangay or its smoke. Its proximity, though, was evident enough from the regular, impressive shaking of the earth and the tremendous peals which marked each explosion."7 Ultimately, Sangay and its plume of smoke were revealed to him, and then, "I commenced a sketch of the effect, but constant changes rapidly followed and new beauties were revealed as the setting sun crested the black smoke with burnished copper and the white cumulous cloud with gold. At intervals of nearly four in five minutes an explosion took place; the first intimation was a fresh mass of smoke with sharply defined outlines rolling above the dark rocks followed by a heavy, rumbling sound which reverberated among the mountains."8 The inference here, of course, is that the sublime is very difficult to attain, that one must scale the heights, risk "life and limb," as Tuckerman recorded it, at "great cost of fatigue and exposure'" in order to experience it. The adventurous wayfarer's journey, in effect, assumes not only the characteristics of the tour de force, but a special moral significance. Indeed, the introduction of a pious morality often signaled the increasing Christianization of the sublime in the nineteenth century. In operatic paintings like Heart of the Andes, or Cotopaxi (Fig. 1), the senses are blurred in a paroxysm of activity. Cotopaxi erupts. Sounds fill the air. One is reminded of the noisy con- versions of the evangelical revival especially prevalent in the upstate New York area that spawned so many Hudson River painters: shouting, biting, groaning, etc. The tumult of such paintings corresponds to the moment of destruction in the apocalypse, and the moment of conversion in revivalism. Here sublimity over- whelms with a deafening roar. It maintains its ties with the older sublime through its stress on man's insignificance in the face of God's terrible power. 6. David C.

That Church's his- trionic paintings called to mind the apocalyptic consumption of the world by fire is suggested by Tuckerman's remark, in writing of Heart of the Andes: "Seldom has a more grand effect of light been depicted than the magnificent sunshine on the mountains of a tropical clime, from his radiant pencil. It literally floods the canvas with celestial fire, and beams with glory like a sublime psalm of light."10 Thus the sublime was being absorbed into a religious, moral and often nation- alist concept of nature to contribute to the rhetorical screen under which the aggressive conquest of the country could be accomplished. The older sublime was a gentleman's preserve, an aristocratic reflex of romantic thought. The Christian- ized sublime, more accessible to everyone, could be more democratic, even bour- geois. Its social effect was thus far wider. The change in the meaning of the sublime then, was intimately connected with the power the American landscape seems to have exerted over the American mind, adding to the status of the land- scape artist as a useful member of his society. As early as 1835, in his "Essay on American Scenery," Thomas Cole, Church's mentor and teacher, had offered a clue to still another shift in meaning. Cole in- troduces the traditional idea of the sublime when he finds in the mountains of New Hampshire "a union of the picturesque, sublime and the magnificent," and in the Sandwich range, especially, a mixture of "grandness and loveliness . . . the sublime melting into the beautiful, the savage tempered by the magnificent."'1 But in addition to such familiar late eighteenth century notions of the sublime, properly blended with the beautiful and the picturesque, Cole cautions the reader to "Learn the laws by which the Eternal doth sublime and sanctify his works, that we may see the hidden glory veiled from vulgar eyes."12 Nature is both sublime and sanctified. The task of artist and spectator is to un- veil, to reveal the hidden glory. It is perhaps of no small coincidence that the idea of revelation, and also of Revelation, is often found in conjunction with this Christianized sublime. Thus Durand, in his famous Letters on Landscape Paint- ing, picked up his friend Cole's theme twenty years later. To his hypothetical stu- dent, he writes: "I refer you to Nature, early, that you may receive your first im- pressions of beauty and sublimity, unmingled with the superstitions of Art."'3 And though he continues that "Art has its superstitions as well as religion," he notes shortly after: "There is yet another motive for referring you to the study of Nature early-its influence on the mind and heart. The external appearance of this our dwelling-place, apart from its wondrous structure and functions that minister to our well-being, is fraught with lessons of high and holy meaning, only surpassed by the light of Revelation."'4 For Emerson, the connection between the sublime and Revelation was even closer: "We distinguish the announcements of the soul, its manifestations of its own nature, by the term Revelation. These are 10. Ibid., p. 378. 11. John McCoubrey, American Art 1700-1960, Sources and Documents, Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1965, p. 103. 12. Ibid., p. 110. 13. Ibid. 14. Ibid., pp. 111-112. [39]</page><page sequence="5">The American Art Journal always attended by the emotion of the sublime. For this communication is an in- flux of the Divine mind into our mind."15 But that revelation, as an experience of the sublime, was not necessarily apoca- lyptic was also suggested by Cole in the same seminal essay of 1835. For Cole re- fers to a moment when, confronted by two lakes in Franconia Notch, he was "overwhelmed with an emotion of the sublime such as I have rarely felt. It was not that the jagged precipices were lofty, that the encircling woods were of the dimmest shade, or that the waters were profoundly deep; but that over all, rocks, wood and water, brooded the spirit of repose, and the silent energy of nature stirred the soul to its inmost depths."'6 Sublimity, experienced not through lofty wildness, but through repose, silent energy, had important connotations for the future. "I would not be understood that these lakes are always tranquil," Cole continues, "but that tranquillity is their great characteristic. There are times when they take a far different expression, but in scenes like these the richest chords are those struck by the gentler hand of nature."17 With a sublime discovered not in sound, but in silence (in what Emerson called the wise silence of the Oversoul), we move into another philosophical region. Such a concept is essentially mystical, recalling Meister Eckhart, whom the Ger- man idealists, so avidly read by Emerson, rediscovered. Eckhart spoke of "the central silence" of the soul, in which it is attuned to "this utterance of God's word."18 Though, as stated earlier, the older sublime was sometimes characterized by silence, it was an awesome, even an unsettling silence. There is, in the later sense of the sublime, precisely an element of peace and tranquility that sets it in opposi- tion to the earlier concept. That there was an appreciative audience for such quiet sublimity is suggested by Tuckerman's record of criticism of Kensett's Lake George: "Mr. Kensett has long been accepted as a most consummate master in the treatment of subjects full of repose and sweetness, and been honored by critics and painters for the simple and unpretending character of his works . . ." Tuckerman adds, "The subdued tone of the autumnal atmosphere and foliage in this picture is tender and true; its effect is singularly harmonious; how exquisite the clouds, warm the atmosphere, and effective the large oak in the foreground; and above all, what sublime repose!"19 If the older sublime could be characterized by the vigorous sound of a cataract, the repose of Lake George, steeped in silence, found its oral equivalent in un- ruffled water. Water assumes a special significance in American landscape paint- ing, linking different kinds of aesthetic and landscape. The subject of much con- temporary comment, we are justified in speaking of the "unruffled mirror" as a motif, bearing strong feelings of a spiritual order. Even in the large, dramatic compositions, which maintain contact with the older sublime, water often inserts a quota of stillness, symbolizing a spirit untroubled in its depths, and unifying both surface and depth in its reflection of the world 15.

The artist and spectator, after scaling the picture's height, and descending to its valleys, in an empathy that was encouraged, could here find rest. Thus when we see pockets of still water in nineteenth century American landscape we may speak of a contemplative idea, a refuge bathing and restoring the spirit. And of a compositional device marrying sky and ground by bringing the balm of airiness and light down to the earth on which the traveler stands. When Cole, again, in the same essay, spoke eloquently of the "purity" and "transparency" of water, and isolated "the unrippled lake, which mirrors all sur- rounding objects," and expresses "tranquillity and peace," in which the most per- fect, and therefore the most beautiful reflections might be found,20 he was ex- pressing a form of idealism that once more recalls the traditional language of Christian mysticism. Clear, pure water has always been a very obvious Christian symbol, frequently used as a symbol of the Holy Virgin. It reappears now, in the writings of Emerson, and of Thoreau, who called a lake "the landscape's most beautiful and expressive feature. It is earth's eye; looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his own nature."21 Of Walden, he wrote, "Walden is a perfect forest mirror . . . Nothing so fair, so pure, and at the same time so large, as a lake, perchance, lies on the surface of the earth. Sky water. It needs no fence. Nations come and go without defiling it. It is a mirror which no stone can crack ... a mirror in which all impurity presented to it sinks, swept and dusted by the sun's hazy brush ...22 Such expanses of water "like molten glass cooled but not congealed,"23 occur most frequently in American art in the transcendental landscapes, generally called luminist, which suggest to us Emerson's observation: "The laws of nature answer to those of matter as face to face in a glass."24 The still, glassy surfaces of luminist landscapes, perfect mirrors of God's word, recall Eckhart's, "The eye and the soul are also mirrors and whatever stands in front of them appears within them."25 In paintings by Heade, Lane, Gifford, Kensett, and countless others who were prac- ticing this quietistic mode at least part of the time, silence, soul, mirror are all re- lated, and as Thoreau suggests, swept and dusted by light. Light is, of course, more than any other component, the alchemistic substance of the landscape artist, whereby he turns matter into spirit. For Durand, sunlight was, among other things, a type of the divine attribute.26 For Cole, the sky itself was "The soul of all scenery, in it are the fountains of light, shade and color.... It is the sky that makes the earth so lovely at sunrise, and so splendid at sunset. In the one it breathes over the earth the crystal-like ether, in the other the liquid gold."27 In American art especially, light has often been used in conjunction with water to aid towards spiritual transmutation, either dissolving form, as in some of Church's large South American pieces, or rendering it crystalline, as in the works of Lane. In the former, light is more closely attached to what we generally call 20. McCoubrey, op. cit., p. 103. 21. Henry David Thoreau, Walden, New York: Mentor, 1953, p. 128. 22. Ibid., p. 129. 23.

In the latter, light itself par- takes of the hard shiny substance of glass. In all instances, the spirituality of light signals the newly Christianized sub- lime. In the large paintings by Church and Bierstadt light moves, consumes, agi- tates and drowns. It brings with it an ecstasy that nears transcendence, but be- cause of its activity can never consummate complete unity with Godhead. In its striving it is Gothic, in Worringer's terms, and human. Though it draws on the older concept of the sublime, it extends the aesthetic to a religious attitude, main- taining nonetheless a distance from Deity. Although overwhelming scale estab- lishes the smallness of artist and viewer, the painting, through the stroke that activates atmosphere, avoids negation of the artist's ego. Perhaps the difference between the two later concepts of the sublime lies precisely in the extent to which such paintings are still anthropomorphic. In the smaller, luminist paintings, occasionally executed also by Church and Bierstadt, light, because of its silent, unstirring energy, causes the universe, as Emerson would have it, to become "transparent, and the light of higher laws than its own" to shine through it.28 For Emerson, the soul in man "is not an organ,... not a faculty, but a light.... From within or from behind, a light shines through us upon things and makes us aware that we are nothing, but the light is all."29 Such a concept is not unlike Eckhart's idea of the soul "coming into the unclouded light of God. It is transported so far from creaturehood into nothingness that, of its own powers, it can never return to its agents or its former creaturehood."30 The nothingness of which Eckhart speaks involves a mystic abandonment of self that makes the ultimate distinction between those American landscape paint- ings that are transcendental and those that maintain an anthropomorphic tie to the ego in the midst of spiritual and religious experience. The admonitions to the painter to lose sight of himself in the face of nature came from many quarters. We find it in the popular periodicals, in the artists' journals, as well as in Tran- scendental writing.31 But in actual practice, only in luminist quietism does the presence of the artist, his "labor trail" disappear. Such paintings, in eliminating any reminders of the artist's intermediary presence, remove him even from his role of interpreter. In their quiet tranquillity, they reach above time and outside of space. In this new concept of sublimity, oneness with Godhead is complete, and the influx of the divine mind is no longer mediated by the theatrical trappings of the late eighteenth century Gothic. 28. Atkinson, op. cit., p. 19. 29. Ibid., p. 263, "The Oversoul." 30. Blakney, op. cit., p. 159. 31. See for example Crayon, Vol. I, No. 23, June 6, 1855, "Studying from Nature," p. 354, where the author admonishes the artist, "But this one thing ever remember, that before Nature you are to lose sight of yourself, and to seek reverently for truth, neither being captious as to what its quality may be, nor considering whether your manner of telling it may be the most dexterous and draftsmanlike. It is not of the least consequence whether you appear in your studies or no-it is of the highest importance that they should be true." See also Mount: "A painter should lose sight of himself when painting from nature-if he loves her-If a painter loves nature he will not think of himself-she will give him variety and raise him from insipidity to grandeur." (Undated ms. at Stony Brook, after journal entry of November 9, 1846.) And of course, see Emerson's famous statement in "Nature": "Standing on the bare ground-my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space-all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eyeball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or parcel of God." (Atkinson, op. cit., p. 6.) [42]</page></plain_text>
