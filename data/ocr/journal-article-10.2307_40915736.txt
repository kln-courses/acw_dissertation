<plain_text><page sequence="1">Scandinavian Studies VOLUME 21 FEBRUARY, 1949 NUMBER 1 AUGUST STRINDBERG- 1849-1912 BETWEEN TWO ERAS Carl E. W. L. Dahlström University of California, Berkeley year 1949 marks the centenary of Sweden's outstanding man of letters: August Strindberg. Although he has been dead thirty-seven years, this man and his remarkable works still constitute for American students a largely unexplored field of literature. Indeed, even to many who profess to be specialists in the modern drama, Strindberg is little more than a name which evokes a sense of uneasiness. There may also be vague recollec- tions of woman-hating, irrationality, the unconventional, the little theater, North-European provincialism, with older schol- ars recalling that Strindberg was once considered a bright light on the horizon of the literary world. He is not, however, defi- nitely classified in the professional mind; hence he remains to a great extent an enigma, something to touch upon lightly or else completely ignore. It is my conviction that Strindberg is by no means a literary puzzle, certainly not for those of us living in these first few years following the close of the Second World War. That is why in this essay I propose to discuss the man and two eras - that which has been and that which is coming into being - for, to me, Strind- berg appears to be a kind of artistic colossus having one foot resting uncertainly on the crumbling old and the other seeking support on the yet unstable new. It is, in truth, a tantalizing hypothesis that Strindberg's intuitional genius was so great that he apprehended the position of contemporary men, that is, men contemporary to him, to us, and perhaps to the immediately following generations. In point of fact there can be no gainsaying that this Swedish artist had a hypersensitive awareness of himself as a conscious man, that 1</page><page sequence="2">2 Carl E. W. L. Dahlström he struggled fervently to probe the depths of his own nature so as to uncover whatever reality might be found there. From a position of institutionalized religion, Strindberg moved to an avowed atheism and then evolved into a partial mystic, one not fully divorced from superstition. Scientifically he tried to get at the common basis of all matter, but his skill and training did not match his intuitional grasp and he was unsuccessful in his research. Socially he looked for an Eden but found himself sinking ever more deeply into a human Hell. In no case could he master the situation, whether in the microcosm of his own being or the macrocosm of the world at large. Despite some of his actions and the tone of a number of his literary works, Strindberg yielded finally neither to religious resignation nor to psychical disintegration. The Unknown in To Damascus at least made a gesture of resignation, but Strind- berg himself did not cease thinking, searching, and writing, al- though negative results came constantly to hand. Unlike the Captain in The Father, Strindberg did not surrender to insanity. Nor was he lured by a feeling of futility to cry out "Carpe diem!" and thus ignore all problems by anaesthetizing himself with whatever pleasures life could afford. Rejecting the old absolutes, abandoning the axiomatic certainties of the past, Strindberg endeavored to seize upon his freedom, to seek and to find what- ever might be. Doggedly he pursued the way of the free man, and in seeking to free himself and others, he became inextricably involved, enwebbed, entangled, enmeshed. In the long run he was also frustrated. And he moved toward a possibly logical end of all determined searches for freedom: spiritual isolation ac- companied by great compassion for the generality of men. Man- kind is to be pitied! "Det är synd om människan!" Strindberg was tremendously aware - terrifyingly and trem- blingly aware - of the fact that not merely were many things amiss in our world but that everything of importance seemed to be losing its function as a point d'appui. The old values had lost their inherent solidity, their quality of permanence, and the new ones were as yet either inadequate or too unformed to offer support. There was no turning backward to rest on the quondam firm foundations of the past; there was nothing to which one</page><page sequence="3">August Strindberg - 1849-1912. Between Two Eras 3 could move forward with confidence. Strindberg was caught between two great eras, the one that had not yet passed and the one that had not yet come into being. Sources of Confusion It is customary to speak of great men in relation to the soci- ety in which they lived. In recent years some writers have also pointed out the difficulties encountered in the treatment of such a relation. Inasmuch as we are discussing Strindberg and two eras rather than one, we should be cognizant not only of the usual difficulties but also of the possibility of increasing them, perhaps even geometrically. Patently a genius and a society may react in so many differ- ent ways that one cannot select any one as the sole right way. Note, for example, the following possibilities: (1) the great man may make society what it is, moulding it in his own image; (2) society may fashion the great man; (3) the two may complement each other; (4) the two may interact positively and develop each other; (5) society and the great man may engage each other antagonistically; (6) they may be mutually indifferent; (7) both may be determined by chance; (8) both may be determined by antichance. Finally, as so often occurs, it may not be any one of these that forbids analysis, but a combination of two or more, or perhaps all in a complex mass and arrangement. It is clear that no social law exists to help us solve the problems aris- ing from the relations of a genius to his Age, for by the nature of the attendant circumstances, the evidence can never be complete. Our problems are, however, still more complicated by diffi- culties arising from another source. We have, for example, often employed terms like "society," "age," and "era" without bearing in mind that such terms are only abstractions, verbal conveniences/The same error is apparent when we discuss the institutions of society and treat them as though they were tangible entities. August Strindberg was a man, a human ani- mal, definable as such, and hence he functioned as an organic unit. A society, an age, or an era, on the other hand, is only a figment of the mind, a verbal invention by means of which we</page><page sequence="4">4 Carl E. W. L. Dahlström provide a definite, unified existence for that which essentially is indefinite, disparate, and without tangible existence. Thus when we write about a genius and his Age we are discussing two elements that are not commensurable: the one is an objective phenomenon; the other, a subjective invention. The man August Strindberg was born; he was seen, heard, wined, and dined; he died and was buried; his collected works comprise fifty-five very tangible volumes. His contemporaries thus had many objective contacts with the man; but no one had any such contacts with the age in which Strindberg lived. All that we can say about a society or an age is that a man may influence a fellow man or many other men, or vice versa; or, to put it otherwise, when many men seem to be acting in much the same way, we tend to discuss them as though they constituted an integral or corporate unit, a society. Moreover, when through a period of time a society seems to have a distinct character, we call it an age or era. There is, of course, no harm in this manner of speaking, provided we always keep in mind that we have employed a convenient fiction to help us compre- hend some facts. é From what has just been said, it follows that we should have certain implications in mind when we discuss Strindberg and two eras. During Strindberg's lifetime large numbers of men and women were, consciously or unconsciously, ceasing to act as their predecessors had acted and likewise ceasing to subscribe to the ideas handed down to them. Some of them were outwardly conforming to the old patterns of thought and action, but this was lip service without conviction. Others were striving to find new and acceptable patterns of behavior, new and substantial principles for guidance. At the same time, however, they were not thinking and acting in complete freedom; their actions and beliefs were not wholly voluntary responses of the free, inquiring mind. Through their crafts, businesses, discoveries, and sciences, men had finally created what we call the Industrial Revolution, which, in turn, required behavior patterns that have helped to make contemporary people what they are. Let us repeat. Strindberg was a man, an objective phenome- non. 'The old era' is a term referring to the close similarity of</page><page sequence="5">August Strindberg - 1849-1912. Between Two Eras 5 action and belief on the part of men and women on the basis of their regard for certain principles which they considered unshakable and even absolute. 'The new era' refers to the close similarity of action and belief on the part of men and women on the basis of their admitted inability to accept principles of their predecessors plus their search for or declaration of another and more satisfying way of life. The Pattern of the Old Era Let us look backward, bearing in mind that our perspective is largely West-European and Mediterranean. The concepts of our predecessors bear witness of a people whose convictions of certainty and of absolutes generally nullified a completely free inquiry before it had much opportunity to flourish, certainly before it could develop a scientific or truth-seeking skepticism. The latter element rarely enjoyed anything more than a hypo- thetical or academic existence. Faith among our predecessors was a conditioned response of such power that there was no room for an inquiry that genuinely probed into the core of actions and of ideas. Indeed, free thinking was immediately associated with an attack on institutionalized religion; it denoted a lack of proper faith, with the result that "freethinker" was synonymous with "infidel." To be disinterested was tantamount to being atheistic. This faith of the old era was not a matter of belief in a mystical, incorporeal spirit, an all-pervading, etherealized Nature, a philosophical concept, or any verbalization connoting evanescence; it was belief in a corporate deity. This corporate deity was a glorified image of man, an image inescapably modified by a remarkable number of man's characteristics. God, in other words, was a person. The Holy Trinity, despite hundreds of years of theological debate revolving about hypostatic unity, remained tres personae not only for the laity but for the majority of the clergy as well. Consubstantiation, impanation, and tran- substantiation are doctrinal words which further emphasize the corporate quality of deity. But there were more than deities of an upper world. As there was the beneficent force, God, there was also the maleficent force, Satan, or the Devil. Heaven, the abode of the good in the</page><page sequence="6">6 Carl E. W. L. Dahlström upper world, was a dimensional place even as Hell, the abode of evil in the lower world, was also a dimensional place. The "other world," in its dual locations, was peopled as this earth is peopled. Always there were persons, corporate beings, glori- fied or debased images of man. This religious view is obviously that of anthropomorphism, a view which has dominated the human mind of Western Europe and Asia Minor throughout thousands of years, the exceptions notwithstanding. That it is still present in our Christian churches is evidenced by a recently published statement ascribed to a clergyman. The churchman allegedly stated that a certain kind of behavior is "enough to make God vomit out of his mouth," a rather nauseatingly clear index to contemporary anthropo- morphism. In Strindberg's works of the nineties and the early part of the present century, the battle between the freedom-seeking individual and the anthropomorphic powers is crucial. The mani- festations of supernatural powers are very tangible. Moreover, the victory, often enough, seems to go to the corporate deity of the old era. Anthropomorphism, a kind of religious, corporeal isolation- ism which could not comprehend spirit, had its counterpart in the cosmology of our predecessors. Through our readings in history, chiefly in the history of science, we have observed that cosmologies changed, usually painfully and slowly, in relation to the developments of astronomy. But the scientific concepts of the skygazers did not penetrate the consciousness of the majority of the people, including those in professional positions. The cosmology of the majority remained geocentric. To them the earth was obviously flat and located at the center of a universe immediately comprehended through the senses. The sun and moon moved around the earth; the firmament was the solid vault of heaven; the stars were arranged in a pattern on the firmament. The directions of up and down placed the earth at the center of the world; so too, north, south, east, west. The astronomic developments of the past few centuries had little more than a verbal influence on men's thinking. No matter how great the universe, it was apprehended as something within</page><page sequence="7">August Strindberg - 1849-1912. Between Two Eras 7 human grasp. The gods, the stars, and the sun and moon were all gathered within the comfortingly close horizon of man's sensuously apprehended world. Again, man's picture of himself was in harmony with his anthropomorphism and his provincial cosmology. He regarded himself as the raison d'être of all things; hence it was but natural for him to think that the entire universe was created as a prov- ing ground where he might be individually prepared for eternal life. Indeed, man thought of himself as a fixed entity, an incar- nate soul possessing an inborn sense of right and wrong plus a prescribed amount of intelligence. His body was derived from the dust of this earth, but the essential part of him was his im- mortal soul. Both, of course, were created by the deity. Man dwelt on this earth as a unit of corruptible flesh; yet in relation to the other world he was absolutely certain that he represented a unit of incorruptibility. While it was true that, on leaving his earthly domicile, man shed the mortality of the flesh, he never- theless conceived of himself as a tangible unit almost identical with his earthly self. In his heaven he would wear a golden crown on his head, he would be arrayed in pure white robes to cover his nakedness, he would sing the praises of the deity, he would strum a harp with his fingers. And he would also have wings to enable him "to fly all over God's heaven." To all in- tents and purposes man was a mortal-immortal in both worlds. The man of Strindberg's first era had long been conditioned to fixed ideas of authority, discipline, and obedience. Despite the prominence of the Virgin Mary and the occasional tendency of cult to elevate her to the prime position in the divine family, the Christian world has remained masculine. Moreover, the male has been the seat of authority, legal and extralegal, by divine fiat. Let us first consider, the authority of the male in the home. It is not an authority based on a superiority determined by fact and reason; it is simply an affirmed suzerainty of the male, supported unequivocally by Holy Writ. As a body has but one head, so the family has but one head. As the Father-Ruler of all men is definitely masculine, so the father-ruler of the earthly family is also masculine.</page><page sequence="8">8 Carl E. W. L. Dahlström Into such a domestic institution most of our predecessors were born. And into such a family Strindberg was born. His father was the unquestioned head of the household. He governed his wife and his children arbitrarily by virtue of the authority implicit in his sex and his position. He was supported in his power by Church and State. What this kind of home meant to a sensitive child of the nineteenth century is clearly revealed in Strindberg's early autobiographical novels. The old era was an age in which positions of authority were automatically assigned to the male. Positions in the State, the Church, the professions, and in business and industry were filled by men; and in the home the lowliest of all males was legally the master. In every case the position carried an author- ity assumed by those subject to it to be beyond question. It approached, if it did not attain, infallibility. The male was not only incarnate soul; he was the incarnate law. He was a terres- trial deity. Discipline was thus a training to recognize men in positions of authority and to obey them unhesitatingly. It was a condition- ing to respond automatically to king, priest, commander, owner, father, or their duly appointed representatives. It was de- cidedly the rule of men rather than the rule of laws. The female was excluded from positions of authority because she was as- signed by divine command to a place of servitude. Disobedience was disloyalty, a rebelliousness toward divinely established sovereignty. Thus disobedience was ipso facto an offense to deity, a rebelliousness toward the Godhead itself. Anthropomorphism, the primacy of the male, and provincial cosmology are reflected in practically all the activities of the past. Education, or formal training, was limited almost exclu- sively to the male offspring of people in important positions. Education as free inquiry to aid men to understand themselves and their world was all but non-existent. For the most part, knowledge meant eternal truths from which right actions and right thought could be deduced, and education consisted pri- marily of training in such knowledge. Thus morals were readily determined. Each individual was simply responsible for squaring his thoughts and actions with the eternal truths. All in all, the</page><page sequence="9">August Strindberg - 1849-1912. Between Two Eras 9 old era is of one pattern, with dominant concepts and actions conditioning all the thoughts and behavior of men. With a few lines we have now very sketchily limned the governing characteristics of the old era, into which Strindberg was born. The governing characteristics are found in absolutes, undebatable certainties, integral units, limited horizons, and the arbitrary rule of men in positions of authority. It is an era in which the world is conveniently small, and the retailed knowl- edge thereof a matter of crude sensuousness and diurnal neces- sity. It is, in many respects, still an age of rude civilization, for it was never moulded in the image of the men possessing the greatest wisdom. The New Freedom There had long been another element present in this first era, into which Strindberg was born: a sense of freedom and an awareness of it. An awareness of freedom inevitably brings about inquiry, and inquiry leads unerringly to a questioning of values. Amenhotep IV questioned the certainties of his day; so, too, Micah, Socrates, and many others. And those who questioned the established values of their day and brought their queries to the attention of their fellow men were reviled, stoned, driven into exile, imprisoned, given the cup of hemlock to drink, cruci- fied, or otherwise summarily disposed of. Those who raised doubts about fixed values, long acclaimed to be absolute, almost invariably suffered at the hands of their fellow men, because, in this first era, the response to a limited, fixed, static, and bound world always dominated the apprehension of a limitless, un- charted, dynamic, and free world. Actually, of course, the sense of freedom possessed such po- tentiality that it made changes possible long before they oc- curred. The long delay was occasioned by the fact that a society cannot be genuinely free until the men and women comprising the society are free. Thus there is something whole about freedom. And the fight for intellectual freedom was an integral part of the battles for the political freedom, religious freedom, and personal freedom of all men and women. Men were put into prison, they were tortured, they were driven out of their coun-</page><page sequence="10">10 Carl E. W. L. Dahlström tries, they were put to death, but the sense of freedom did not perish. Indeed, within the last two centuries men have solemnly announced the fact of freedom - personal, political, religious, and intellectual. What we call the Industrial Revolution also got under way and constitutional governments asserted them- selves, for the demand arose more and more clamorously for a government of law rather than of arbitrary men who insisted that they themselves were the incarnation of law. Within these last two hundred years we have also had a promise of full-fledged freedom for some not too distant day. Most symbolically it appeared in the attempts to create a new era in a new geographical location: the American continent. With the United States of America, a nation of people at last consciously planned a co-operative venture in freedom. Yet this new era could not possibly come into being immediately; the men who tried to create it were still largely conditioned by habits of thought and action which precluded the probability of their recognizing that freedom for themselves meant freedom for all others. There had to be a general transmutation of values, that is, a successful substitution of a new conditioning for the old. If the eighteenth century gave the new era its first vision of hope fulfilled, it was the nineteenth century that brought the conflict of the old and new into sharp focus. And it is the present century that has demonstrated to us how thorough is the col- lapse of the old values, a collapse already remarkably depicted in the dramatic literature of August Strindberg. Strindberg was born in 1849, when the new freedom had already brought about clashes with the old absolutes. It was also a time when a new compulsion was beginning to condition the new freedom - the compulsion introduced by the growing economic interdependence of men. The Industrial Revolution, let us bear in mind, was a revolution! It brought about powerful and striking changes in our economy and hence in our habits of life. The economic changes, implementing, and implemented by, scientific discoveries, dealt the mortal blow to the old era through opening to many men a vista of freedom, although the ruins of the old era are still with us and so impressive that they convince some people that they are not ruins at all but a living structure,</page><page sequence="11">August Strindberg - 1849-1912. Between Two Eras 11 imposing and commanding. Thus Strindberg was born at a time when the old conditioning was beginning to wear off, to lose its effect, even though men nominally clung to the old world. And he died before any considerable body of men awakened to the fact that the old era had lost its vitality. He is of great importance to us because he was in the vanguard of those who felt, if they did not fully understand, that men were moving toward a universal crisis involving all their actions and their habits of thinking. They were launching themselves on a co- operative venture in freedom. The Collapse of Values To note what has happened to established values we need only retrace our steps through the pattern of the old era. The anthropomorphism of the old era is still with us, as revealed by the clergyman's reference to "a vomiting deity," but this re- ligious view has suffered severe and even devastating attacks from thinkers, churchmen, and religious movements. A few instances will suffice for our purposes. Consider first of all the biologist Pierre Lecomte du Noüy. Despite some popular ver- sions of the religious concepts that he has promulgated, it is clear that this scientist has broken with the prime anthropo- morphic ideas of the old era. Du Noüy's conclusions in biological science are commensurate with his conclusions pertaining to religion. The French scientist disposes not only of the carping atheist but also of the censorious, patriarchal deity. Moreover, he indicates that some ecclesiasts have broken with the old era when he quotes the following statement made by Dr. William Temple, Archbishop of Canterbury: "It is a great mistake to suppose that God is only, or even chiefly, concerned with religion." Again, in some of our modern, institutionalized forms of Christianity we have a complete abandonment of anthropo- morphism. In one denomination agnostics and atheists are welcome if they are sincere seekers of truth and righteousness. In another, the old solidity has disappeared into spirit so thoroughly that flesh apparently does not have any real exist- ence, and the ailments that flesh is heir to are essentially nothing more than errors of mind.</page><page sequence="12">12 Carl E. W. L. Dahlström The direct and indirect attacks on anthropomorphism have been sufficiently successful to influence many individuals de- spite their lack of reasoning about the problems involved. The spread of formal education in the nineteenth century, imple- mented in the New World by the idea that the truth would not only make us free but was necessary to keep us free, eventuated in the growth of free inquiry, making inevitable a clash with the anthropomorphism that had so long conditioned men's thinking and actions. The church leaders who feel that the education of great numbers of individuals (heretofore often called "the rabble" or "the masses") has been responsible for the decline of ecclesias- tical authority are quite right. Free inquiry is not consonant with unquestioned obedience to men in positions of authority; such obedience not only deprives the individual of considered option but also places him in bondage by transferring respon- sibility to the person of authority. Free inquiry creates free agents. The individual moves towards maximum independence by virtue of the fact that he must question all authority in the attempt to determine values, because he is responsible for him- self. The tortured path of Strindberg again appears before us: the free individual is his own scapegoat! In education, then, the new freedom was passed, wittingly or otherwise, from a small clique of specially privileged people to an ever-widening circle of men and women. It brought with it free inquiry. Hence it occasioned the questioning not only of anthropomorphism as the dominant religious concept but also of the authority of men in ecclesiastical positions. Something of the same kind has occurred in our cosmology. Four centuries ago Copernicus permitted European men to enter a world of tremendous space; yet the Ptolemaic world, or even the pre-Ptolemaic, conditioned the minds of our prede- cessors, for men had to live beyond Newton and encounter Einstein and Bohr before they could become partially oriented to the new concepts of the universe. Our comfortable directions of up and down, north and south, east and west, are meaningless in the universe at large. Even if the new telescope at Palomar can reveal astral bodies that are supposed to be a billion light years from the earth, that is, a little short of six sextillion miles</page><page sequence="13">August Strindberg - 1849-1912. Between Two Eras 13 distant, we shall still be unable actually to grasp the nature and extent of space, so conditioned are we to geodetic measurements. The static world of limited directions and finite dimensions is disappearing; we are trying to comprehend a directionless uni- verse of dynamic relations, and we feel very small, immature, and lost. It is probably symptomatic of the new era that, as we appear to have lost our way in the immensity of space in our universe, so too we have lost a sense of direction in our social order. This is noticeable in the large, in the aggregation of sovereign nations; and in the small, in the home itself. Think of what has happened to the latter. The patriarchal form of the family has not only been challenged - women did that for centuries upon centuries - but it has been so weakened that it is doubtful if it will ever be resuscitated. The new freedom does not permit bondage, for freedom is whole; hence there can be no slavery of the female, regardless of the biblical subjection of woman to man. Thus, too, woman's sole place is not in the home; like man's place, it is everywhere that human beings live and act. Those who think that the new freedom has broken up the home are quite right if by "home" they mean the male-dom- inated, durable domestic institution of the old era. The increase of divorce, the changing of monogamy to mean one legal, living mate at a time, the removal of penalties formerly imposed on women considered guilty of improper conduct, notably in mat- ters pertaining to sex, the humanizing of women (previously held as chattels and in the Old Testament associated with property like the ox and the ass), the nineteenth amendment to the United States Constitution and similar changes in European countries - all these are evidences of a change of values as re- gards the domestic institution. The man has lost his position of arbitrary authority in the home. He is no longer the king in his castle; he is a co-partner in a domestic venture. Here was a terrain on which Strindberg's dramatis personae fought repeatedly and desperately, for the battle of the sexes is exploited again and again. Time after time Strindberg chal- lenged the emerging concept of the new era as regards the home, and, in his literary creations, one could well believe that he was</page><page sequence="14">14 Carl E. W. L. Dahlström pointing to the old era as the one having the more significant value. Yet when he married - and remarried - he turned to a woman who could not possibly fit into a home dominated by an arbitrary, authoritarian male. His dramas may be considered as in part nostalgic in relation to the old but nevertheless per- sistently provocative in the presentation of a situational complex involving the old and the new. Somehow, the new home, created by free individuals engaged in a co-operative domestic venture, ought to succeed, despite the failures in Strindberg's personal experience. While apparently he himself could not invoke authority by virtue of his superior position as male (hence the head of the household), either because he did not care to do so or because he married the kind of woman who would brook no such attitude on the part of a husband, Strind- berg trembled with apprehension at the loss of the old certainties associated with male primacy even as he trembled with excite- ment, also qualified by fear, at the possibilities of the new free- dom. Strindberg was not sure of himself. After all, what was he? Incarnate soul? Descendant of apes? An organic mechanism? Evolving homo sapiens, moral man? The nineteenth century offered various answers, but with the growth of biological science an overwhelming amount of evidence pointed to the animality of man. In truth, the incarnate soul could scarcely survive in the anatomical laboratory; the soul element became lost and vir- tually disappeared in the analytical and experimental studies of biology. Indeed, by the time that the twentieth century was well under way, the notion of fixed personality was evaporating. No longer did man have a definite sense of right and wrong ladled into his soul at conception; no longer did he have a specific intelligence quotient allotted to him. Man learned that per- sonality is a complex of social and biological factors, that it can be greatly altered by environment, accident, illness, or the sur- geon's scalpel. Sigmund Freud, a few years younger than Strindberg, was working on the problem of the self through a scientific approach, but Strindberg - always remarkable for his intuitional powers - was independently giving a dramatic demonstration of the</page><page sequence="15">August Strindberg - 1849-1912. Between Two Eras 15 problems that Freud was analyzing in the laboratory. The Swedish artist knew that man as a fixed entity, a dimensional incarnate soul, was disappearing; man as a psychological com- plex, perhaps even mystery, was beginning to emerge. Life might even be a dream play! It makes little difference whither we turn - whether to sci- ence, art, religion, or social organization - the old values have suffered collapse. Almost everything of which man had pre- viously been completely certain came to be questioned. The old feeling of confidence and security as regards the whys and where- fores of life, as regards man's actions and thinking, had been giving way gradually for centuries. Then, with the added push of the Age of Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, the growth of personal freedom, and the spread of formal education, the certainties slipped away. Various positive motivations of life lost their force, and even when men assured themselves that they clung to eternal verities, they still felt a constant, gnawing skepticism that gave no peace. As men were freed from the absolutes, they lost their sense of direction. Having been so confident of the Tightness of their deductively formed ideas and actions, they suddenly felt utterly lost and alone. They were unprepared to rely fully on inductive procedures. The New Compulsion An ironic factor in the growth of the new freedom and the dissolution of old values is the threat of a new slavery. The spirit of free inquiry operating in the new freedom brought us increased knowledge of man and his universe, and this knowl- edge stimulated man's inventiveness. Thus it has happened that, during the last two centuries, there has been an almost miraculous growth in the scientific instruments and gadgets that man has made for himself. These tools have contributed to the possibility of the oft-dreamed Utopian age of abundance for all men, but they have also created an economic interdependence that would have appalled our ancestors, even as it frightens some of our contemporaries. Paradoxical as it may seem when superficially regarded, the very instruments which have been created through an enterprise that has been more free than</page><page sequence="16">16 Carl E. W. L. Dahlström controlled have led to an era in which enterprise is of necessity becoming more controlled than free. Nature once provided periods of abundance and of dearth through the accidents of good harvests and poor, the ancient feast-and-famine cycles. But man has now added to the natural cycles, while controlling them to some extent, because he has created alternating periods of prosperity and depression. The expanding economy is ines- capably a spending economy, and it continues to thrive or to grow extensively and intensively only as it is supported by con- sumers, that is, by spending. Moreover, we have passed from the independence of the isolationist feudal town to the inter- dependence of nations as well as of the communities within each nation. We cannot, for example, permit our coal mines long to remain idle or our systems of transportation to cease operation, because masses of individuals are dependent for survival on the continuity of such services. We are, in effect, already on the threshold of conscription of additional departments of both capital and labor, and some nations have crossed the threshold. The development of local, federal, and international controls of the movements and labor of men is thus not a matter of ideology (socialism, communism, industrial democracy, and the like); it is a consequence of the actions which we and our predecessors have taken. We have literally made ourselves so dependent on one another economically that we do not dare trust the arbitrary power of any individual or clique. If the coal miners should decide that they had had enough of their extremely hazardous employment and should quit once and for all time, we could not allow them the freedom to do so; we would have to conscript them for service at least until we could train competent replace- ments. If the mine owners decided to close the mines, we again could not permit them to do so; we should be compelled to seize the mines so as to k^ep them in continuous operation. The shadows of a new bondage are thus already upon us, and power- hungry individuals and cliques are always awaiting pretexts to take over full controls and rob us of all initiative and freedom. The idea of the good life as a co-operative venture in freedom does not appeal to those who are strongly conditioned to the old absolutes which provide rule by arbitrary men in positions of authority.</page><page sequence="17">August Strindberg - 1849-1912. Between Two Eras 17 The pattern of interdependence has thus awakened new fears in men - fear of conscription to routines with loss of freedom in choice of occupation, in education, in movement about the world, in all phases of self-determination; fear of being left outside the spending economy so necessary to survival; fear that life itself will essentially become meaningless. There is, indeed, a fear that man may lose that for which so many fought and so many suffered and died - his personal freedom. And fear, we must bear in mind, almost invariably affects man's reason. Let us make no mistake about the character of this new compulsion. On the one hand, it is not at all a matter of ideology; on the other, it is not a matter of determinism. It is a direct consequence of our own actions and those of our predecessors. It is thus something alterable and controllable. The Significance of Strindberg The man who can see what no one else can see is either a madman or a genius. Many of Strindberg's contemporaries, and even successors, decided that he was a madman. We, how- ever, are in a position to realize that he was unquestionably a literary genius of first rank. Like the prophets of old, he was an interpreter of the world in which he lived. Through this very brief study of two eras, the reader of Strindberg should see clearly the conflicts in which the author and his characters were intimately engaged. Note that Goethe, who was born exactly a century before Strindberg, could still create a Faust, a character that, no matter how tortuous the way, could move toward ultimate triumph. But Strindberg, who died eighty years after the death of Goethe, created for his great character of the To Damascus trilogy a figure called the Un- known, a creature unknown to himself as well as to others, a creature whose struggles for freedom, for enlightenment, for goodness, brought confusion rather than positive answers. The Unknown has lost all sense of direction; no one can tell him what to do or where to go. He cannot go back to the former absolutes because they have lost their values; he cannot go forward to new convictions, because he only dimly apprehends their pres- ence and cannot find them. Hence the fearful wanderings, the disillusioning activities, the collapse of values. There is nothing</page><page sequence="18">18 Carl E. W. L. Dahlström for the Unknown to do but to resign himself to the situation. Yet even his resignation is not a matter that brings conviction; it is a formality rather than a spiritual actuality. If we understand what has been happening to us, we are in a position to understand Strindberg. He need no longer be con- sidered an enigma, for he is a symbol of modern, uncertain, groping, frustrated man, a creature almost unknown to himself and to his neighbor, a creature marked by fear and great anxiety. Strindberg went through his mental turmoil at the close of the nineteenth century; and now, in the middle of the twentieth century, statesmen, religious leaders, educators, publicists, and others are revealing their inability to offer directions that are recognizably valid. As so often happens, men who have sought positions of leadership or who have had these thrust upon them, are unable to offer competent assistance. It is no secret that they too are frustrated. Like the dramatis personae of Strindberg's plays they wander about aimlessly or they vainly point to some- thing that now lies behind us. Because the old day has not yet fully gone nor the new day clearly dawned, we are cousins-german with August Strindberg. Like him we have lost our points d'appui; we are gravely per- plexed, confused, frustrated. At times, we would like to give up, to take refuge in the limitations of one of the old formulas; or we would like to fling aside all the mind- tasking cares and join those frenziedly moronizing themselves in sheer, physical pleasures, or in activities which permit no time for contemplation. But we cannot resign ourselves to that which we know to be inadequate, we cannot yield to despair, we cannot stoop to self- stultification. We must still march with Strindberg along the great highway of life - stora landsvägen - as free men seeking for the way in which we can live and realize ourselves. It is my considered opinion that, if we try to comprehend what our elders were and also what we are becoming, we shall have no difficulty in understanding Strindberg, both as regards his life and his literary production. The sense of bafflement will disappear, and appreciation of genius will grow.</page></plain_text>
