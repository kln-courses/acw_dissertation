<plain_text><page sequence="1">God's Image and Man's Imagination. By ERDMAN HARRIS. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1959. xiv + 236 pages. $3.50. "Images of God which stimulate the imag- ination--that is what this book is about" (p. xiii). With these words, Dr. Harris be- gins a rapid survey of the ideas of God en- tertained by such disparate souls as John Calvin and Elvis Presley (the latter name is not actually mentioned, but who else has won popularity as a singer partly by the use of suggestive bodily movements?). As a teacher in such schools as the American Uni- versity in Cairo, Union Theological Semi- nary, and Yale Divinity School, Dr. Harris has been confronted with ideas of the deity which he describes as "conventional, uncon- ventional, and downright weird." While Harris does not make such an identification, we may feel that we are ap- proaching the downright weird in the case of Floyd Patterson who was convinced that the Lord was surely with him as he battered his glassy-eyed opponent into insensibility. When the above-mentioned singer "con- fesses" that God has been good to him, and a well known movie actress refers to God as a "Livin' Doll," we would seem to be mov- ing in the realm of the unconventional. With a running start like this, Harris races along touching lightly the more conventional views of God held by numerous men and schools of thought. Einstein, Jeans, Kepler, Dean Inge, Luther, Wesley, Shaftesbury, Paul Tillich, and John Baillie are a few of the men con- sidered. Sectarian ideas and images of God are represented in the present volume by the Anabaptists, the Moral Rearmament Move- ment, the Latter-day Saints, Seventh-day Ad- ventists, Spiritualists, Jehovah's Witnesses,</page><page sequence="2">384 BOOK REVIEWS Theosophists and Christian Scientists. There is even a chapter which discusses the images of God found in the great and the not-so- great hymns of the church. This rich variety of sampling makes easy and sometimes de- lightful reading. Laymen will enjoy it, but scholars who are looking for depth of critical analysis may be disappointed. Some biblical interpreters will be troubled by Harris' discussion of the God of the Bible. Harris says that the God who pre- sents his back to Moses in Exodus is not quite so anthropomorphic as the God who walks in the Garden of Eden in the cool of the day. Harris explains how ideas of God gradually become more sophisticated as we move up through the centuries. In Genesis, God is not quite sure where Adam and Eve are hiding. Then, progressively, God be- comes the storm God, war God, tribal God who hates Israel's enemies, an agricultural God who is sometimes confined to a geo- graphical area, and finally with the prophets and Jesus we arrive at ethical monotheism and a God of love. G. Ernest Wright (The Old Testament Against Its Environment, p. 10) might raise the question whether or not the "evolution of rational concepts is the main problem of our enquiry," when we are trying to understand the biblical man's relationship to God. Is the challenge-response nature of the biblical faith blunted by Harris' emphasis upon men's ideas of God ? Alan Richardson (Preface to Bible-Study, p. 34) will say "we do not want ideas about God, we want God." Richardson and Barth (who is not once mentioned in Harris' book) will suggest that the excellence of the Bible is not to be found in its ethical or moral teaching nor even in the sophisticated ideas of religious geniuses, but rather in the fact that in the Bible we have God's word to man, a word which demands commitment and obedience. In mentioning Wright, Richardson, and Barth, we do not mean to imply that we are completely out of sympathy with Harris. Indeed, we are troubled when Barth seems to say that our sin is in evidence when we ask the question, Who is God? On the other hand, we are eager to avoid the danger of taming God by putting a rational cage around him. Harris' decision to discuss the divine-human encounter of the biblical record in terms of men's ideas of the Deity may not do justice to the dynamic of God's self- revelation to Israel which comes as specific historic events creating both faith and com- munity. Several other questions also come to mind as we read Harris' book. Does man's notion of a good deity come from a "recognition of the promptings towards the ideal within the human heart" (p. 202) ? To what extent does the creative imagination of man produce images of God which will satisfy man's deepest cravings for order and meaning in the universe (p. 80) ? And finally, what is the relationship between man's rational con- cepts and his personal commitment to God? What is the relationship between religion and faith ? As these questions will indicate, Harris does stimulate thought. Detailed answers are not given, but one of the marks of a great teacher (and perhaps this applies to an author) is that he provides his students with the incentive to do further study. Harris' book will do this. THURMAN L. Coss Hamline University</page></plain_text>
