<plain_text><page sequence="1">FATHER TYRRELL'S DOGMAS JULIUS I. BELLA Bridgeport, Conn. I Father Tyrrell is one of the foremost exponents of Roman Catholic Modernism, the attempt to reconcile Roman Catholic- ism and modern culture. Roman Catholic Modernism is not a system, a coherent whole proceeding from a philosophical foun- dation, not a body of doctrine, but rather an "orientation," a "method." It does not form a school, but rather consists "of a number of individual attempts to set forward a revision of tra- ditional orthodoxy." Such attempt is made by Laberthonniere, LeRoy, Loisy in France, by Murri, Fogazzaro in Italy, and von Hiugel and Tyrrell in England. George Tyrrell' was born in Dublin, Ireland, on February 6, 1861. His family belonged to the Church of Ireland and was pervaded by a Low Church, Calvinistic atmosphere. Tyrrell at first learned to consider Roman Catholicism as the "religion of the Helots, and of vulgar and uneducated classes." Attend- ing the ritualistic Grangegorman Church (Dublin), the Catholic Church first cast "the spell of her beauty upon him." Tyrell never recovered from this spell. Reason told him that Romanism is a fraud and at the same time his heart wished that "Roman- ism should be defensible." In this wavering it was Robert Dolling who made him see that for a mind like his Rome was the resting place, i. e., that he needed a position of finality. On Sunday, May 18, 1879, Tyrrell became a Roman Catholic. Soon after joining the Roman Church, Tyrrell applied for membership in the Jesuit order. The order's militant This paper is a part of a dissertation presented for the degree of Doctor of Philoso- phy in Yale University. 1 The principal source for Tyrrell 's life is his Auttobiography, and the Life of George Tyrrell, by M.

He was sent for a year's probation to Cyprus and then to Malta, after which he entered the novitiate at Manresa in 1880. In spite of his disappointing first experiences with Jesuitism (suspicions, spyings, etc.), Tyrrell took his vows, and was sent to the seminary at Stonyhurst to begin his three years' training in philosophy. Here scholasticism and St. Thomas Aquinas absorbed most of this time. He became an ardent disciple of St. Thomas and began to consider as his future task the "mastering and defending" of Thomism. Completing his course in scholastic philosophy, Tyrrell entered upon a period of teaching (Malta) and then upon his theological course, (four years, St. Beuno's College, N. Wales). In 1891 he was ordained priest. The next few years were occupied mostly by parish work, and then came the appointment to the chair of philosophy at St. Mary's Hall, Stonyhurst. Because of his favoring Neo-Thomism, Tyrrell was forced to leave his posi- tion after only two years of teaching, and was sent to Farm Street to join the writing staff of The Month, a publication edited by the English Jesuits. Previously (since 1886) Tyrrell had contributed a num- ber of articles to this journal, some of which were published later in The Faith of the Millions. His first three books were Nova et Vetera (1897), Hard Sayings (1898), and External Religion (1899). They are devotional and orthodox in char- acter. Part of his studies of St. Ignatius was published in The Soul's Orbit (1904). Then came one of the decisive influences of his life, the friendship with Baron F. von Hiigel, under whose guidance Tyrrell became acquainted with Bergson, the French philosophy of action, and modern biblical criticism. Through influence "outside the shelter under which he lived," Tyrrell soon lost faith in scholasticism, yet he did not become a modernist at once. Between the years 1897-1900 he believed progress possible in a way presented by Newman's law of development. Tyrrell could not accept Newmanism for long and consequently his membership in the Societas Jesu became full of insincerity. In 1899 Tyrrell published an article "A Perverted Devotion." This article was condemned by the censors in Rome; Tyrrell was forced to retract, was forbidden to write except in The 317</page><page sequence="3">CHURCH HISTORY Month, and went to live in virtual retirement at a small Jesuit mission in Richmond, Yorkshire. In Richmond, Tyrrell began a period of great activity. Since censorship was strict, it drove him into "anonymity and pseudonymity." He participated in the controversy regarding the authority of the pope, which arose in connection with the publication of the Joint Pastoral of the English Catholic Hierarchy, December 29, 1900, by writing to the editors of the Weekly Register and the Pilot, under various pseudonyms; he published a collection of his essays in The Faith of the .Millions (1901); wrote Oil and Wine; circulated privately Religion as a Factor of Life (later published as Lex Orandi); printed for private circulation The Church and the Future; com- posed the celebrated Letter to a Professor (1903-1904); fin- ished Lex Credendi (1905), and published many articles in The Month and other periodicals. In these works we see Tyrrell already as a modernist. During this strenuous activity, Tyrrell's relationship with the Jesuit order was nearing its crisis. He often corresponded with his superiors regarding his position in the order, where he clearly stated that "he felt no inward obligation whatever towards the Society in foro conscientiae," yet officially he was connected with it, which made it difficult both for him and the Society. Finally, in 1905, he made a definite application for his secularization. The Sacred Congregation was well disposed to grant it; Tyrrell, however, could not find an "episcopus benevolus," i.e. a bishop willing to accept him in his diocese. These negotiations were still proceeding when on Dec. 31, 1905, some quotations appeared in Coriere della Sera from Tyrrell's Letter to a Professor, and were ascribed to an English Jesuit. The general of the order immediately suspected Tyrrell. Tyrrell acknowledged his authorship and was forced to retract the statements published. Since the retraction did not seem satisfactory to the ecclesiastical authorities, the general of the Jesuits dismissed Tyrrell from the Society (Feb. 19, 1906). Tyrrell lost his priestly rights, and his suspension could be raised only by the pope. Various steps were undertaken by Tyrrell himself and by his friends to regularize his position. Finally Cardinal Mercier, the archbishop of Malines, was empowered by Rome to grant Father Tyrrell the right to say mass and receive him 318</page><page sequence="4">FATHER TYRRELL'S DOGMAS into his diocese, on condition "that the same pledge himself formally neither to publish anything on religious questions nor to hold epistolary correspondence without the previous approba- tion" of a censor. Tyrrell flatly refused such an intolerable condition. After his dismissal, Tyrrell travelled for a while; finally he settled in Storrington and was received as a boarder of the Premonstratensian Priory (May, 1907). The prior of the monastery approached Rome for at least a temporary celebret for Tyrrell. The negotiations were successful and Tyrrell signed a promise (Aug. 30, 1907) "not to publish any sort of theological teaching . . . without due authorization." How- ever when certain papers boasted of Tyrrell's submission, he retracted his promise. In 1907 Tyrrell published his great work, Through Scylla and Charybdis. On Sept. 8, 1907, Pope Pius X promulgated the encyclical Pascendi, which was directed against the whole movement of Modernism. Tyrrell wrote two defiant articles against this encyclical, which appeared in the Times on Sept. 30 and Oct. 1 (also one article in the Giornale d'Italia), under the title "The Pope and Modernism," openly criticizing the papal point of view. This open defiance sealed Tyrrell's fate as far as Rome was concerned. On Oct. 22, 1907, he was deprived of the sacraments and his case "reserved to the Holy See." It was not merely a diocesan, but an universal excommunication. On account of his letters against the encyclical, Tyrrell became the central figure of the Modernist movement. As a leader of Modernism he published many articles, and lectured before various groups. In 1908, Cardinal Mercier addressed his diocese on Modernism and mentioned Father Tyrrell by name. Tyrrell replied to the cardinal by his Medievalism. His last writing was Christianity at the Cross Roads (published post-humously). Tyrrell died prematurely after a short illness on July 15, 1909. In Tyrrell we find both intense piety and intellectual hon- esty. He is above all a man of religion. He lives in God and Christ. He is a mystic, a Roman Catholic mystic. His devo- tional works are a great contribution to religious literature. From the last Roman layman to Cardinal Mercier2 they were 2 Medievalism, 1 ff. 319</page><page sequence="5">CHURCH HISTORY read with great spiritual profit. They cannot fail to impress any reader with their spiritual fervor and devotion. Tyrrell is also a lover of the Roman Catholic church. He is impressed by the church's universality and historical continuity. Mysticism and Catholicism, individual religion and love of the universal church are the two branches of Tyrrell's religion. An intensely religious individualist may remain in the church so long as the doctrines, policy, government of the church do not interfere with his religious life. In case of conflict it is nrot the church, but the individual conscience that reigns supreme. Such is the case of Tyrrell. Keen observers notice even in his early Wvorks that although they are orthodox, their tendency goes beyond the fold of officialism.3 When the conflict between Tyrrell and the official church becomes acute, Tyrrell considers only his religious conscience, and declares that the true authority is not the pope, but the re~ligious conscience of the saints. The conflict between Tyrrell and Rome originates in Tyrrell's intellectual curiosity and honesty. He learns and studies and sees the scientific truth, which contradicts the of- ficial teachings of the church, which undermines certain foun- dations to which the church appeals to prove its authority.4 At first he is an ardent defender and propagator of militant orthodoxy. He believes in the "depositurn fidei" in which all the teachings of the church are found either explicitly or implic- itly, he accepts Thomism as the last word and settlement of all problems. This does not satisfy him for long and he accepts Newman's theory of development. New researches follow under the influence of Baron F. von Hiigel. Newman satisfies him no longer. Tyrrell goes his own way to solve the discrepan- cy of the Roman Catholic theology and the findings of modern scientific research. He loves the church and desires to find a solution that would enable him to remain in the church. Tyrrell solves his problems by enunciating the difference between religion and theology. His religion is mystical. Man has a religious sense through which he can directly experience God. True mysticism is the love of God. Side by side with the mystical is the moral side of religion. The moral side con- nects with the mystical in the conception of morality, as the 3 A. Fawkes, Studies in Moderism, 14. 4 The interest of Tyrrell in the relation of science and theology was awakened by reading A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom, by A. D. White (New York, 1896). 320</page><page sequence="6">FA'lTHEl TYRRELL'S DOGMAS union with God. Revelation is a form of religious experience. The recipient of revelation spontaneously chooses symbols which best express his experience. These spontaneous formulations of the experience of revelation are the primary dogmas. The primary dogmas of Christianity are the "depositum fidei," and as such are authoritative. Their content is the love of God and they are interpreted by Tyrrell from the standpoint of love. Reflection soon begins to work on these original formu- lations and thus theology and theological statements, secondary dogmas come into existence. The old symbolism is restated into a theological system; new, secondary dogmas are born to protect the original deposit of faith. The test of the truth of dogmas (both primary and secondary) is practical. Their true content is religious, spiritual. We have then the following picture before us: 1. Religious experience, which is the love of God. 2. Spontaneous symbolical expressions of the experience (primary dogmas). 3. Reflections upon the experience of spontaneous ex- pressions of it (theology and secondary dogmas). 4. The value of dogmas is religious; their interpretation must be in accordance with the religious experience of love. 5. The original spontaneous Christian dogmas are the authoritative "depositum fidei." New dogmas may be promul- gated only to protect these original dogmas. (We have then primitive symbols, symbols chosen by re- flection, symbols chosen to protect the original symbols, and translation of the original symbols into new symbolism). What is the relation of religion and theology? Religion is the experience of God. Theology is the restatement of this experience with the aid of reason. Religion is the subject matter of theology. Conflict between science and theology is impos- sible from this point of view. Such a conflict is possible only between what Tyrrell calls "theologism" and science. Theol- ogism is the system of the official church (scholasticism, medievalism, officialism) which deduces logically certain con- clusions from the "inspired and largely symbolic utterances of prophecy" "and imposes its conclusions in the name of both reve- lation and of reason, as binding at once on the conscience and 321</page><page sequence="7">CHURCH HISTORY on the understanding."5 This theologism is the "mother of all heresies," "an enemy of faith and reason," "the force," which drives out of the church "all religious minded men."6 Theology for Tyrrell is like any other science. Its subject matter is revelation viewed as experience. Such a theology must develop freely under no limitations other than those "imposed by its subject matter and the laws of thought." New dogmatic de- cisions of the church cannot come into conflict with science, because they are only protective decisions of the original record of revelation and thus have no scientific or philosophical infallibility.7 Primary dogma controls theology, as the facts of science control science.8 Biblical criticism, comparative religion, can proceed with their search for the truth. They will not hurt the Roman Catholic dogmas, because these dogmas are only symbolical expressions of the Spirit of Christ. There can be really no conflict between modern science and the Spirit of Christ. Revealed truth and fact truth belong to two different worlds. Theology and the other sciences are thus not bound to the category "of a past age consecrated by Divine Authority."9 Tyrrell is by no means original in his treatment and solu- tion of the problem, religion versus theology. Official Catholi- cism, liberal Protestantism, leave their traces in his thought. He accepts the "depositum fidei" and all the dogmas of the Roman church, but interprets them by using the principles of liberal Protestantism. We must accept the original deposit of faith as normative, but the essence of this normative record is the love of God and love of man. Augustinianism, mysticism, Thomism, Newmanism, Bergsonism, the Philosophy of Action, Pragmatism, Apocalypticism, find their place in Tyrrell's thought; St. Thomas and Kant, St. Francis and Matthew Arnold, A. Sabatier, A. Harnack, J. Weiss, and A. Schweitzer stand there side by side; Balfour, W. James, Blondel, Laber- thonniere, Loisy, Le Roy, are there absorbed.'0 Every new author Tyrrell reads influences him. Hence there are many contradictions in his thought. Tyrrell is like any other Roman 5 Through Scylla and Charybdis, 350-351. 6 Ibid., 350. 7 Ibid., 353-354. 8 W.

He is bewildered. If he is conscientious he tries to square his old conceptions with these, for him new, discoveries. Tyrrell was indeed conscientious. Every new book which Tyrrell wrote, showed a wider outlook, and new views, which he tried to co-ordinate with his previous thought. He started out with mystical religion, but read M. Arnold and Kant and he began to speak of moral religion. He read Newman and adhered to Newman's theory of development; then under the influence of German critics he found it impossible to accept the development, and August Sabatier and French Modernism offered him a way of solution. He accepted Harnack's Christ, then read J. Weiss and accepted the apocalyptic Christ. From Thomism he came to Bergsonism and Pragmatism. When he died prematurely, his thought was as yet not final. Tyrrell, however, always re- mained faithful to his mysticism. It was on the basis of his inner mystical religion that he tried to co-ordinate all the new ideas. Indeed, Tyrrell's great strength is in the sphere of re- ligion: "on the side of devotion and religious feeling.""1 He did not contribute anything original to the problem of the relation of theology and religion, and his attitudes, just because of his constantly widening intellectual horizon, were not con- sistent towards the religious problems of his age. Tyrrell's originality lay in his intense piety. He put the stamp of his "inward Christ" on every problem he discussed. Revelation, dogma, theology, acquired in his discussion a new freshness, by being looked upon "sub specie religionis." II One of the most interesting and most important phases of Tyrrell's thought is his differentiation between the primary and secondary dogmas. Religion, declared Tyrrell, cannot exist without some form. Man lives in the internal, spiritual, and also in the bodily, external world, and so his religion must be pertaining to both. Thus the desire of man to put his religious experience into the forms of external world is inevitable. It is "present simultaneously" with the experience of God. Re- 11 A. Houtin, The Crisis Among the French Clergy. 12 H. Rashdall, Ideas and Ideals, 141. 323</page><page sequence="9">CHURCH HISTORY ligion as "pure sentiment" i. e., inward experience without outward expression is doomed to failure, just as much as merely external religion without the inward experience. Formulation is both essential to religion and inseparable from it. In history we cannot find internal without external religion. If there seems to be a priority between the religious experience and its formu- lation, it is merely logical.13 The formulation of the religious experience of revelation is called dogma, doctrine. Dogma is a "formulated mystery," it is an "outline" of the living reality of religion, it is the "explanation" of the "religious attraction to God," it is the "spoken or written equivalent" of the truth of revelation.' The experience of revelation may be put into form in two different ways: 1. By spontaneously using the means of the external world as symbols, in which case the utterance is the part of the total religious experience. 2. By reflection, after-reflection on the experience, using the means of reason.15 The first form is called the primary or religious dogma, the second, dogma in the secondary sense or theological dogma.'1 There are, however, very few pure primary of secondary dogmas. Most dogmas are mixed products, i. e. there is in them "inspired utterance of immediate experience" plus reflection on the experience. There are many degrees in the formulation of the religious ex- perience ranging from "pure spontaneity" to "pure reflection.""7 The primary dogmas are the revelation in the true sense of the word, the secondary dogmas are theology. In interpreting the different dogmas we have to make distinction between their external (theological) and religious meaning. To solve the discrepancy between the Roman Catholic doctrines and modern science, Tyrrell explains the teachings of the church from the point of view of religion. This is his great task as a Modernist. Doctrines have their roots in religion, hence their real mean- ing is religious. The test of the truth of a dogma (interpreted religiously), i. e. whether it represents reality, is practical. Is a particular dogma an effectual guide to the spiritual life?, 13 Oil and Wine, 1 ff., 53; The Church and the Future, 47, 83; Lex Orandi, 1-2, 10; External Religion, 25, 58. 14 Through Scylla and Charybdis, 156; Hard Sayings, 439; The Faith of the Mil- lions, I, 125; Oil and Wine, 3. 15 Through Scylla and Charybdis, 304. 16 See article, "The Pope and Modernism," in The Times, (Sept. 30, 1907); Letters, 58.

Dogmas accordingly have a threefold meaning: 1. external, 2. practical, and 3. eter- nal.18 Having in mind these views, we are ready to discuss them more in detail. When the new religious truth dawns upon a man it may be so strong that he expresses it without the assistance of reason and reflection, by the material ready in his background and experience. The forms of expression must be found in the external, material, physical, temporal, in factors of "space and time world," in human ideas and language, in sensuous imagery. Moreover, the person receiving revelation uses his own immedi- ate background, language, mental forms, categories, science, philosophy, ethics, history, religious tradition, ritual, and also the language and expression that describe his experience. There is no special language for the expression of revelation, neither is the recipient taught a new language, philosophy, science. If God would use his own divine language, we could not understand it. The expressions of different revelations in history differ according to the culture, language, and back- ground of their different recipients. The uncultured minds expressed their religious experiences with crudeness, the cultured with the refinements of culture.19 The forms of expression of the religious experience are not only materialistic, but also human-like. The structure of man's mind is such that he must think of the spiritual things, and above all of God, in a human way. Man is both spirit and body and is bound by the necessity of this double nature to picture God in the same fashion. Man thinks of God in terms of his own spirit, and of his own spirit in terms of bodily things. It does not mean that God is unknowable, only that by no process of "abstraction, or magnification, or substraction" can the human be excluded from the conception of God. A man is not absolutely unknowable for a mouse, but the mouse's knowledge of man can only be in terms of mouse-life. The very term God, as meaning a person, a spirit, is already a "graven image." In every age the conception of God is differ- ent just on account of the difference between men of the 18 Lex Orandi, 56 ff. 19 The Faith of the Millions, I, 94; II, 293; Hard Sayings, 31; External Religion, 150; Oil and Wine, 3, 5, 80; The Church and the Future, 82; Lex Orandi, 3-4; Through Scylla and Charybdis, 278; Essays on Faith and Immortality, 120. 325</page><page sequence="11">CHURCH HISTORY different epochs of history.20 Imagining God and the spiritual realities human-wise is a necessity of religion. Only with a human-like God can man have practical relations. If God is not within the order of man's experience, he is beyond man's reach and as such means nothing to him. Only a human-like God can appeal to man's imagination and emotion and thus affect man's life. Here lies the great importance of the Incar- nation.21 Imagining God humanwise is not strictly anthropomorph- ism. For Tyrrell anthropomorphism means only the forgetting that our mode of the conception of God is human, analogous." Since these expressions of the religious experience are materialistic and anthropomorphic, it follows that they are in- adequate. Expressing spiritual realities, our language can never be treated as an "equation." Human forms are "infinite- ly inadequate" to express the mysteries of the spiritual world. As music cannot be expressed adequately in terms of color, so the spiritual cannot be put adequately into physical terms. In reference to the spiritual world man is like one born blind, who must express his thought in terms of touch and sound, or like the fish trying to express the life of the fisherman on the river bank in terms of the fish-life (assuming, of course, that there is some communication between the two which has some meaning).23 The representations of the spiritual world in human terms, even if inadequate, are symbolic of reality. We have to borrow a non-spiritual expression from the world of sensuous experi- ence to express the religious reality, yet this expression in some way symbolizes the religious experience of the supernatural order. We use metaphors, similitudes, illustrations, analogies that "suggest" to us the spiritual reality. We can compare a nation to a bee hive, to a tree, to a mechanism, but we cannot say that the nation is literally a bee hive, a tree, a mechanism. In every one of these symbols, however, there is some degree of 20 Hard Sayings, 314-315; Nova et Vetera, 198-199; Through Scylla and Charybdis, 91; Christianity at the Cross Roads, 100, 173, 177; Essays on Faith and Immor- tality, 4. 21 Hard Sayings, 398; 314; Oil and Wine, 251-252. 22 Through Scylla and Charybdis, 91; Lex Credendi, 99-100. 23 The Faith of the Millions, I, 106, 108 ff.; External Religion, 150; Oil and Wine, 3, 12, 74-75; Through Scylla and Charybdis, 89. 326</page><page sequence="12">FATHER TYRRELL'S DOGMAS truth. All our presentations of reality, says Tyrrell, are essen- tially symbolical, analogical.24 Consequently, what we have is not "scientific truth," but what Tyrrell calls, the "prophetic truth," the "vulgar, poetic expression of the religious truth."25 Tyrrell was anxious to state that such a symbolic expres- sion of reality really represents reality. Primary dogma has "a certain approximative agreement with ontological Reality." It is true that the representation is not scientific and literal, but nevertheless a true one.26 Tyrrell put forth two reasons why the symbols truly represent reality: 1. they are chosen spon- taneously: 2. they express the experience of an objective reality. 1. The symbols expressing revelation are chosen spon- taneously. The recipient always chooses the best symbol, analogy, illustration, language which expresses his experience.27 The picturings are given "in and along with" the religious experience. To the revelation proper belong not only the particular experience, but also its translation into a particular language and philosophy. The symbols chosen to represent the experience are natural symbols. They are as natural as the effects which are the symbols of their causes and as parts are the effects of their wholes.28 It is the "transcendent" that shapes "its own symbol and image in the human mind."29 This formulation of the revelation, is prior to reflection and observa- tion. Reflection and observation would result in theology. All instinctive action is accompanied with certain "spontaneously suggested picturings or imaginings" preceding all explanatory efforts. For instance, without being able to understand him- self and the world, the child nevertheless has some kind of "imaginative synthesis" of it. This imaginative synthesis is formed by the very process of living and moving and acting. It serves as a practical guidance very successfully, before any explanation and theory has been received. It is the same way 24 Nova et Vetera, 198 if.; Hard Sayings, 314, 398; External Religion, 6; The Faith of the Millions, I, 94 ff.; 144 ff. Lex Orandi, esp. Ch.

The earliest mythology has nothing to do with after-reflection which tries to understand the immediate experience. It is possibly the very form in "which that direct experience has written itself in the imagination."30 Tyrrell illustrates the same point by the difference between the spon- taneous and the philosophical statement of the phenomenon of moral conscience. Before reflecting about the experience of conscience, men speak of it as a voice, something that whispers to them, and says: Stop! This symbolism possesses a working truth, is given to men "in and along with the experience." Yet reflection will tell us that this is something quite different from the psychological and the metaphysical explanation of consci- ence.31 The statement of experience is sometimes so spontaneous, "that the vision seems something given and imposed and as such is . . . liable to be ascribed to the series of outward phenomena."3 This is so especially among people who do not understand well the mechanism of thought on the one hand, and the physical nature on the other. In such cases it is inevitable that the phenomena of inner experience be interchanged with the phenomena of physical nature. However, such an inter- change is not confined to primitive peoples. Tyrrell mentions the example of Dante, who often describes what he saw, yet at other times we feel that he is really constructing something for us to see.33 If one would choose the symbols to express his experience of revelation arbitrarily, one symbol would be just as good as another, but the choice of symbols is not arbitrary. We see it from the fact that a symbol may represent reality either more or less. For example, God the Father of Jesus is a' far truer and richer symbol of God than the war God of early Israel. Both symbols are unlike the true God in kind, yet in their "an- other kind" (i. e., symbol compared to another symbol) the Father of Jesus is more analogous to God.34 2. The symbols represent reality because they express the experience of an objective reality. The cause is always re- vealed in the experience of the effect. Otherwise it is not a 30 Through Scylla and Charybdis, 279. 31 Ibid., 280. 32 Christianity at the Cross Roads, 146-150. 33 Ibid. 34 Ibid., 111. 328</page><page sequence="14">FATHIEti TYRRELL'S DOGMAS real cause. A real cause or agent can be revealed to us only "in, through, and with its effects or appearances," i. e., when these affect us in some way.35 We get to know the world only by living in it, by experiencing it. A blind man is able to recon- struct the plan of the house he lives in. He does it by feeling his way around, he gathers his experiences and builds up in his mind some structure of the house. This structure is not built in terms of vision, nevertheless it is true in some sense. In the same way the experiences of the other world are true, although expressed not in the terms of the other world.36 The experience is true even if expressed analogously. My fellow man is revealed to me through my experience by spontaneous interpretation. My idea of him is not a symbol, which has nothing to do with him, because I have "an adequate measure of him" in myself. In the same way my idea of the spiritual reality is not a symbol, which does not describe reality at all, because God is immanent in me. Man does not stand in refer- ence to God as an absolutely diverse being. Man experiences harmony and discord with God. In these experiences of harmony and discord, God guides us directly, and the spontane- ous symbols expressing this experience represent the experi- ence and so God in the experience.37 The only test of the truth of the primary dogma is the pragmatic test, the test of life. When a new revelation is conducive to morality, to spiritual fruitfulness, when it satisfies man's mystical and moral needs, when it deepens man's con- sciousness of union with God, it must have a certain agreement with reality.88 The record of revelation belonging to the revelation proper represents Tyrell's final view of revelation. The Roman church accepts a "depositum fidei," where not only the principles ex- pressed, but also the forms of expression, are God-given. Tyrrell's picturings of experience "given in and along with" the religious experience point to a "depositum fidei," even if it belongs to a different order of truth and knowledge, than the record of faith of the official Roman church.39 We can distinguish two post-scholastic and post-Newmanist 35 Ibid., 175. 36 Through Scylla and Charybdis, 182. 37 Christianity at the Cross Roads, 147-149, 175. 38 The Church and the Future, 85; Christianity at the Cross Roads, 112. 39 Through Scylla and Charybdis, 85-86, 95; The Church and the Future, 27. 329</page><page sequence="15">CHURCH HISTORY conceptions of revelation in Tyrrell: 1. revelation is an experi- ence, though the record of it does not belong to the revelation proper; 2. revelation is an experience and the record of it be- longs to the revelation proper. (Presented in Through Scylla and Charybdis and later works.) The religious soul forms his religious experiences with the materials of his environment and culture. These forms are necessarily materialistic, anthropomorphic, inadequate, symbolic, analogous representations of reality. At the same time they truly represent reality, because the choice of these forms of expression is spontaneous, and the experience be- hind them is the true experience of an objective reality. The proof that a religious experience is genuine is offered in the feeling of harmony in the soul of the experiencing person. This truth is proved subsequently by the test of life. This spontaneous expression of the religious experience is the pri- mary dogma. The conception that revelation is necessarily given in human terms in order to be understood by men is a common teaching of Christian theologians. "Impossibile est nobis aliter lucere divinum radium nisi varietate sacrorum velaminum circum- vclatum," says Dionysius. Tyrrell's great teacher, Aquinas, is fond of quoting this phrase. Aquinas points out the fact that in revelation the divine thought has to accommodate itself to the imperfections of human intelligence and language and that man is incapable of receiving revelation except through the data of the physical world.4" The encyclical Pascendi gives an admirable summary of Tyrrell's teaching regarding the origin of dogma; one is almost tempted to suspect that its com- posers had only Tyrrell's system in mind.4' In reflecting on the encyclical, Tyrrell points out that the conception of a dogma (primary, or secondary), as being "an inadequate notion of religious experience" is based on St. Thomas' doctrine of analogy.42 According to St. Thomas, "God 'is' not in the same sense in which creatures 'are'," hence "nothing can be pred- icated of God and the creatures in a univocal sense." All our judgments concerning God have a negative aspect. This does not mean, however, that a proposition concerning a 40 A. L. Lilley, Religion and Revelation, 47 ff. 41 See paragraphs: "The Origin of Dogmas," "Religious Experience and Tradi- tion," "Faith and Science."

If we should admit this loss of all meaning, we must also admit that we can know nothing of God, nor prove anything concerning him without "continual equivocations." There is a certain analogy between the creature and Creator. There is always a certain resemblance between cause and effect. Everything which pro- duces, produces something like itself. The warmth caused by the sun in different bodies resembles in some way "the active power of the sun," which causes the warmth in these bodies; "hence we may say that the sun is warm, although it is warm not in the same sense" as the things to which it gives its warmth. "For the same reason, and because God confers upon all things all their perfections, we are able to discover in all things their resemblance and unlikeness to God." Our statements about God have then an analogical sense; they can be used neither in a "univocal," or an "equivocal" sense.43 The encyclical, Tyrrell implied, implicitly condemns Aquinas' doctrine of an- alogy. The great difference between Tyrrell and St. Thomas in this respect is, however, fundamental. According to St. Thomas, God, so to say, dictates the records of revelation even if in certain respect in analogical, symbolical language, consider- ing the human limitations. Tyrrell speaks of the experience of revelation. It is man who chooses the terms in which to express his experience, even if in this choice he be divinely guided. The picture is not: God giving the external facts, but like in A. Sabatier, God, then "the inner revelation of God" and "piety," which bring forth the different records and dogmas. Tyrrell's spontaneous, though inadequate, expression of reality through symbols is like A. Sabatier's expression of re- ligious experience through spontaneously expressed poetic images; like M. Arnold's Bible as literature, poetry; like Bal- four's insistence on the inadequacy of verbal forms to express religious experience; like the symbolism of the Philosophy of Ac- tion; like Le Roy's dogma rooted in religious life and expressed through metaphors, anthropomorphic symbols, analogies; like Loisy's "ideas" as representations of faith. For all these thinkers, as for Tyrrell, revelation is an experience, and the record of it is symbolical. Like Sabatier, Laberthonniere, Le Roy, Tyrrell sees the experience of revelation formulated 43 Etienne Gilson, The Philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas, 109 ff. 331</page><page sequence="17">CHURCH HISTORY through the means of the recipient's own categories. Like Balfour, and Pragmatism, Tyrrell maintains that the test of truth of dogma (in this case primary dogma) is life. Tyrrell, however, differs from these thinkers by his emphasis on the difference between primary and secondary dogma. For Tyrrell primary dogma is a purely spontaneous expression of religious experience without reflection. Sabatier permits such an ex- pression for a child or a savage; the others speak of only secon- dary dogmas. The distinction between the primary and secon- dary dogmas Tyrrell in his own admission borrows from New- man.44 However, Newman did not consider primary dogmas in Tyrrell's sense. III The spontaneous symbolical statement of the religious ex- perience of the Bible is the deposit of faith to which all subse- quent revelation (experience plus spontaneous record) must conform. This deposit of faith is mysterious and therefore grasped only by faith. However, human reflection starts to work upon this deposit (primary dogma) as soon as it comes into existence. There is not only a necessity to state the re- ligious experiences, but also a necessity to state them coherently. Newman declared that dogma is a "fundamental principle of his religion," and that religion as a mere sentiment is a "dream and mockery."45 A. Sabatier insisted that religion cannot exist without dogmas, and emphasized that discarding religious doctrines would mean the discarding of religion.46 Balfour pointed out that applying reason to religion is neces- sary, otherwise religion could not develop.47 The French Modernists took dogmas for granted. In fact, just because they considered them necessary, they occupied themselves so much with their meaning. For von Hiigel, religion "without at least an implicit theology is like a man without brain, a bundle of sentiments and blind impulses and aimless contor- tions."48 Similarly to these thinkers, Tyrrell declared that religion 44 "The Pope and Modernism," in The Times (Sept. 30, 1907). 45 Apologia, 67. 46 Outlines of a Philosophy of Religion, 229. 47 The Foundations of Belief (London, 1897), 267. 48 Blondel, Laberthonniere, Le Roy, Loisy; see Tyrrell's review of von Hiigel's The Mystical Element of Religion, in the Quarterly Review (July, 1909), CCXI, 110. 332</page><page sequence="18">FATHER TYRRELL'S DOGMAS needs theology and theological dogma. If religion is the affair of the whole man, then it must try to understand itself. The necessity of religious statement is also practical. If the spiritual realities are to regulate man's outward actions at all, they must be first understood, and placed somewhere on the "map of our understanding." Only religion stated in rational terms can awaken one's religious sense. God guides men 'through common beliefs, opinions and systems of theology."49 "Revelation (i. e. the record of revelation) evokes revelation (i. e. the experience of God) in us.""5 Naturally, we need the underlying religious experience to understand the message of the dogmas. We hold a light to the end of a taper in order that the flame may be communicated to the taper and make it a source of light. If the taper is damp or incombustible we cannot communicate the light to it. Dogma applies the flame to the inner religion of our soul. Without the latter, it could not be communicated at all.51 Reason starts its way toward the formulation of the re- ligious experience by trying to understand the revealed religious dogmas, i. e., the spontaneous records of the religious experi- ences. Soon, however, it must recognize its insufficiency to grasp the revealed truths.52 Tyrrell always protested against rationalism. Rationalism takes from the revelation only the things it can understand. It expects the doctrines to fit into our thoughts, to justify themselves to us. It teaches that we cannot accept them until we understand them and absorb them into the unity of our mental system. The desire to unify, explain the external truths is, of course, legitimate, but this possibility of the systematization, comprehension, cannot be the essential condition of their credibility.53 The capacity of reason as an "all-sufficient guide in matters of morality and re- ligion has been tried in balance of history and found wanting." The fact that Christianity is the religion of multitudes proves that it does not rely on the supreme importance of reasoning, because reasoning belongs only to a cultured few. From the very earliest days the Christian church relied on the faith of 49 The Church and the Future, 82. 50 Through Scylla and Charybdis, 208, 305-307. 51 External Religion, 44; Oil and Wine, 5. 52 External Religion, 19; The Faith of the Millions, I, 95; Through Scylla and Charybdis, 93. 53 The Faith of the Millions, I, 93; Oil and Wine, 53-54.

Reliance on analytical reasoning would have made Christianity only a philosophy for the enlightened minor- ity.54 Reason cannot understand revelation because 1. God is above our comprehension, and 2. His revelation is symbolical, not fitting our conceptions. 1. The "Beyond" is mysterious, hence rationalism is impossible. It is narrowness, a sort of "intellectual provincial- ism," that makes us fail to realize that it is impossible for any part to comprehend the whole of which it is a part. Only the whole can be really like the whole, except when we are dealing with "a mere quantitative homogeneous totality." The part comprehends the whole not as the whole, but as a part. If our eyes or ears could be independent personalities, they would conceive the bodies as some superior eyes and ears and would criticize their actions from their viewpoint. The hen-coop for the chicken would be a great egg-shell, and the world a great hen-coop. For us the universe in "an infinite earth governed by an infinite man" and we pass judgment on the words of God as if the universe were a machine, an organism, which we could understand. We should realize that the whole is not like us. "Nothing is so unreasonable as to expect God's ways to seem always ... reasonable to us." A comprehensible revela- tion is absurd, because it is comprehensible. The author of a comprehensible revelation is man and not God. The rejection of unreasonable in revelation is thus "the very height of un- reason."55 2. The teachings of the primary dogmas, whatever they mean in the human order, mean something indefinable and analogous in reference to the divine order. Tyrrell gave two examples to demonstrate this. How can we understand per- sonality in reference to the person of Christ and the Trinity?, asks Tyrrell. If a modern, educated man be told that there is but one person in Christ, he will understand it like a Monophysite, or Monothelite. If he be told that there are two wills and two natures in Christ, he will understand it like a Nestorian. Three persons in God mean for him three wills. Finally, to cure him of tritheism or Unitarianism, we have to tell him 54 The Faith of the Millions, I, 25-26. 55 Oil and Wine, 58 ff.; Essays on Faith and Immortality, 227; The Faith of the Millions, I, 27. 334</page><page sequence="20">FATHER TYRRELL'S DOGMAS that personality means here something different than else- where. Whatever it means in the human order, it means some- thing undefinable and symbolical in the divine order.56 Or how can we comprehend the eternal generation of the Son by the Father without any conception and parturition? How can there be fatherhood without motherhood? What is the differ- ence between the generation of the Son and the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son? Can we have distinct mental representation of "generation," and "proces- sion?" What is the difference between generation and crea- tion? We cannot know the precise content of them. What we can say is this: By "Filius est genitus; Spiritus est procedens nongenitus" we mean only "Filius est X; Spiritus est Y, non X.""57 This is like Le Roy's demonstration of the impossibility of the intellectualist conception of dogma. (He demonstrates the impossibility to understand the personality of God, the resurrection of Christ, and the dogma of real presence.)58 Even if reason fails in the comprehension of the religious dogma, this intellectual curiosity is the beginning of theology. The application of reason takes us into the realm of theology. Theology, in the widest sense of the word, is the fruit of the reflection of reason upon religious experience.59 Aquinas distinguishes between philosophy and theology. Philosophy, says Aquinas, pursues truth by means of reason alone; theology takes its departure from a "fact independent of Reason, viz., the Revelation given by God." There is a generic difference between philosophy and theology. "Theologia quae ad sacram doctrinamn pertinet, differt secundum genus ab illa theologia qulae pars philosophiae ponitur."60 We find the echoes of St. Thomas in Tyrrell's distinction between super- natural and natural theology. Reflection on revelation is the supernatural theology. Natural theology does not take revela- tion into account. It reflects on the observation of nature. From the beginning we have the revelational and the natural theological picturings of the other world, side by side. We have the revelations in the true sense of the word (i. e., spon- taneous expressions of the religious experience) and the 56 Through Scylla and Charybdis, 339-340. 57 Ibid., 341-343. 58 What is Dogma?

Gilson, The Philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas, 51. 335</page><page sequence="21">CHURCH HISTORY products of natural reason (i. e., in no sense spontaneous crea- tions of the religious spirit). In form, this primitive theology differs in no sense from the expression of revelation, yet one depends on "moral action and disposition," and other on "mental ability;" one is given to man by impression, without his work, the other is "wrought out by the exercise of reason." Tyrrell is not much concerned about this natural theology. He discusses mostly the "supernatural, dogmatic theology," i. e., the repre- sentation of the religious impression.61 Dogmatic theology is a science. It differs however from the other sciences on account of its subject matter. The sub- ject matter of dogmatic theology is revelation, which does not admit new addition in substance. If there should be any new addition to revelation, it must conform to the original "depositum fidei." In other sciences, for example in physics, there may be daily new discoveries, which increase the subject matter, and thus new and higher generalizations are possible. Also revela- tion is mysterious, and cannot be comprehended by human reason, whereas the phenomenal nature is within the grasp of our reason. Theology is a science which with the aid of reason does three things: 1. formulates the religious experience into a concept; 2. systematizes the truths of the revelation into a rational whole; 3. co-ordinates them with the other non-reli- gious experiences and concepts. 1. Supernatural theology is an attempt to formulate the primary religious experiences and put them into the system of understanding;62 into the "schemata of understanding;"63 it is the rational presentation of the mysteries underlying the Christian life;64 it tries to explain revelation in the terms of things known ;65 it translates the language of prophecy into that of science.66 The language of theology is the current conceptual language. As thought-forms change, so does theology; as the circumstances of the human life become different, so does theol- ogy.67 61 Through Scylla and Charybdis, 235, 270, 278 ff. 62 Essays on Faith and Immortality, 9. 63 Ibid. 64 The Church and the Future, 64. 65 Essays on Faith and Immortality, 17. 66 Lex Credendi, VIII. 67 Hard Sayings, XI, ff.; A Much Abused Letter, 30. 336</page><page sequence="22">FATHiE TYRRELL'S DOGMAS 2. Theology not only formulates, restates, but also syste- matizes the truths of religion; it constructs "a scheme of things," a system from the formulated revelation in which all of these formulae find a definite place; it tries to make the sym- bolism of revelation coherent with itself. Man's understanding is restless until it constructs such a system.68 3. Theology not only systematizes, but also co-ordinates revelation with other than religious experiences. It makes revelation coherent with the whole of rational knowledge. Theology, in fact, is only one department "of that systematiz- ing and unifying of all knowledge by which the understanding turns universal experience into account."69 Religion, as an important section of human experience, must find its place in the synthesis of the whole human experience. In short "so far . . . as the understanding reflects on the data of religious experience . . . and upon the ultimate problems raised by the totality of all sorts of experience, and then strives to frame a theory of these matters harmonious with the rest of its systematized knowledge, it gives us a theology."" This exposition of Tyrrell of the function of theology by the aid of reason sounds very much like a commentary on the following passage of Newman: "Reason . . . is subservient to faith, as handling, examining, explaining, recording, catalogu- ing, defending, the truths which faith, not reason, has gained for us, as providing an intellectual expression of supernatural facts, eliciting what is implicit, comparing, measuring, connect- ing each with each, and forming one and all into a theological system."71 The formulation of the religious experience by the aid of reason is the theological dogma, secondary dogma. Secondary dogma belongs to the realm of theology. It is the first result of reflection upon the revelation. By "dogma" is meant a formulated mystery-formulated by theology.72 When Tyrrell speaks of theological dogmas, he means the dogmas of Christianity as we have them now, although he 68 Essays on Faith and Immortality, 5, 9; Christianity at the Cross Roads, 184. 69 Through Scylla and Charybdis, 235; A Much Abused Letter, 29; Christianity at the Cross Roads, 184. 70 Through Scylla and Charybdis, 236; Essays on Faith and Immortality, 85. 71 Development of Christian Doctrine, 336. 72 Through Scylla and Charybdis, 156. 337</page><page sequence="23">CHURCH HISTORY admits the legitimacy of any system based on religious ex- perience.73 The apostolic Christian revelation was translated into the Alexandrine categories of the Athanasian Creed, then again into the Aristotelian categories of scholasticism. We may even go further back than that. There are different theological categories in the different Old Testament writings (Psalms, Prophets, Hellenized Old Testament writings) and the New Testament writings (Synoptics, Pauline, and Johannine documents).7 Revelation needs this constant translation into the "lip language and thought language" of every nation and time and level of culture in order to safeguard the original meaning in its original form and purity. The dogmatic deci- sions of the church that come later are merely "protective of revelation."75 They do not add any new religious knowledge to the apostolic revelation already existing. The apostolic revelation is apt to be misunderstood by men of different ages, because it itself is determined by the cultural level of its recipients. Subsequent decisions are needed to safeguard it from faulty interpretations. Heresies arise; the church has to combat these heresies. "Each dogma records a battle of storm."76 The heresies are refuted in the same language in which they are formulated.77 In this sense, heretics built a large part of the Roman Catholic dogmas (i. e. secondary dogmas). For ex- ample, the doctrine of transubstantiation explains only the precise sense of: "This is My body ;'78 or the Athanasian Creed the doctrine, "One God in Trinity and Trinity in Unity," and reiterates this statement in different forms.79 The doctrines of the church, just because they are formed to counteract the heresies, do not give us "a dialectically developed body of theo- logical truth"; such a view would presuppose that heresies arise in some necessary logical order.80 System is brought into these ecclesiastical dogmas only later, and only as far as they admit of classification. These secondary dogmas give us only a bare outline of experience. They are symbols, although not chosen spon- 73 Ibid., 350. 74 Ibid., 345-346. 75 Ibid., 293. 76 Ibid., 333. 77 The Faith of the Millions, I, 131. 78 Ibid., 142 ff. 79 Ibid., 108. 80 Through Scylla and Charybdis, 332. 338</page><page sequence="24">FATHER TYRRELL'S DOGMAS taneously. They do not mean anything to us without the un- derlying experience. Tyrrell takes the example of the recon- struction of nature by the understanding. Understanding never assumes more than a bare outline of the nature in concrete. It will only be to nature "what a pocket-map is to the city of London-a sufficient guide in certain matters for certain practical purposes."8' We map out our world into categories as we classify books in our catologues, nature in our museums. Yet whoever does not know nature by first-hand experience, could not get very much out of a natural history museum. "Beetles do not march the fields in such logically ordered phalanxes; nor do they wear pins thrust through their middles; nor are bird's eyes made of glass, or their viscera of sawdust, or their muscles of wire. A visitor from some other creation who knew no more of our world than that, would think it a very simple affair; very easy to remember and to retail. Still how little would he know of its reality compared with a denizen of the backwoods."82 In the same way the understanding of revelation presupposes an experiential knowledge of the facts symbolized by this revelation. Let us summarize the above discussion. Reason tries to understand revelation. It fails, because reality is mysterious and the experience of reality is stated in symbolical language. The next step reason takes is the formulation of religious ex- perience into some kind of concept. Thus we get theology. Theology is a science which formulates, systematizes, the truths of religious experiences and co-ordinates them with other non-religious concepts. To this realm of theology belong theological dogmas. A theological dogma is the mysterious revelation formulated into a concept. This new concept is also only symbolical of reality, though the symbol is not chosen arbitrarily. These secondary dogmas, as restatements of the original revelation, need to be restated to every age and culture; new restatements are forced also by faulty interpretations of the original dogmas. There is no development in the strictest sense of the word, only continuous restatements of the original dogmas. This conception of dogmas and theology is indeed very much like that of August Sabatier. Man, says Sabatier, when 81 The Church and the Future, 90 ff. 82 Through Scylla and Charybdis, 87. 339</page><page sequence="25">CHURCH HISTORY his thought was awakened, translated his experience into in- tellectual statements. These statements are dogmas. Dogmatics tries to reconcile the "moral experience of humanity" with the rest of the experience. The intellectual element is symbolical of reality, and is changeable, determined by the culture of the man who thus formulates his religious experience. The evolu- tion of this element is absolutely necessary because culture con- stantly changes.83 We recognize in Tyrrell's conception of dogma and theo- logy also M. Arnold's antipathy against theology as "abstruse reasoning," and his emphasis on the idea that the source of dogma is in religious consciousness; we recognize Balfour's views of the function of reason, as sifting and systematizing of the data of religious experience, and his insistence that the religious formulas have different meanings to men of different religious experiences.84 Tyrrell's distinction between religion and theology is also similar to that of French Modernism. Blondel and Laberthonniere speak of the accounts of religious experiences through the temporary events of this world. Le Roy speaks of the religious foundation of dogma and the development of its explanatory theories and intellectual repre- sentations, according to epochs and individuals. Loisy defines dogma as the interpretation of the facts of religious experience, and speaks of the determination of its forms by contemporary thought and knowledge.85 Tyrrell's conception of dogma and theology is thus by no means original. Theological dogmas, according to Tyrrell, have threefold meaning: 1. the external, 2. the practical, and 3. the eternal.86 1. The external meaning denotes that dogmas are "woven" "into the tissue" of pur natural understanding. They are elements which form our history and philosophy of the world. They are constituents of our whole Weltanschauung, i. e., they are taken into account when we co-ordinate our experiences and connect religion with the rest of our knowledge.8" 83 Outlines of a Philosophy of Religion, 246 ff.; The Vitality of the Christian Dog- mas (London, 1898), 46 ff. 84 Matthew Arnold, Literature and Dogma (New York, 1883); A.

The practical meaning of dogmas denotes that they are effectual guides of spiritual life. The spirit of Christianity is revealed in them.88 We can reproduce this spirit if we live according to the beliefs of the Christian dogmas. 3. The eternal meaning of dogmas signifies that they actually represent reality. They are not only practically service- able fictions, for no fiction can be serviceable to life on a universal scale.89 The idea that dogmas have different meanings is not new. We find this thought in Christianity under the form of the interpretation of Scripture. Aquinas adopted a fourfold classi- fication of the Scriptures: the literal, or historical, the allegori- cal, the tropological or moral, and the analogical. Aquinas is not alone in making the distinction between the literal and spiritual meaning of the Scriptures. Such a distinction was made also, for example, by Hugo of St. Victor (historical, allegorical, tropological meaning),9? Augustine (historical, aetiological, analogical, allegorical,91 Origen (somatic, or literal, psychical, or moral, pneumatic, or speculative sense),92 Clement of Alexandria, and Barnabas (literal and allegorical).9 It is Sabatier, Laberthonniere, and Loisy who awaken Tyrrell's thought in respect to dogma. The true value of dogma for all three is religious, practical. It is Le Roy who deals with dogma most thoroughly. However, long before Le Roy, did Tyrrell ask and answer the question: What is Dogma? (Lex Orandi, where this question is most thoroughly dealt with, was written in 1904; Le Roy's work in 1907). The affinities be- tween Tyrrell and Le Roy are, however, very pronounced. The two thinkers came independently to the same answers. Le Roy's What is Dogma?, says Tyrrell, "struck me as the right line."94 Dogma, says Le Roy, has above all practical meaning, but this practical meaning is clothed in intellectual form and it also cor- responds to a mysterious reality. Le Roy does not recognize any "depositumt fidei."' Tyrrell is Le Roy plus the "depositumz fidei." 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid., 57-58. 90 A. L. Lilley, Religion and Revelation, 64. 91 Ibid., 63. 92 R.
