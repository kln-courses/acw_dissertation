<plain_text><page sequence="1">Imagery and the Protagonist in Maurice Genevoix's Raboliot' Marilyn I. Madden Most critics explain Maurice Genevoix's writing by his geographi- cal origins.2 And, indeed, his native province of Sologne has determined the majority of the settings and many of the characteristics of his works. But imagery is also an important trait of his style. One of its functions is to assist in the portrayal of characters, as we see by examining in detail its presence in Genevoix's most famous and perhaps best novel, Raboliot. The novel has a simple plot. Raboliot, whose greatest joy in life is poaching, finds himself in conflict with a law forbidding it. Unable to conform to the demands of modern civilization (circa 1925), he eventually becomes a fugitive. A brutal gendarme, obsessed with his capture, draws him into a trap, whereupon Raboliot ends his hunter/hunted existence by killing the gendarme and surrendering to the authorities. An accurate view of the imagery in this work requires a considera- tion of all of the subject matter used. The following statistical tables show the relative importance of the different categories.3 A quick glance at the tables reveals that each category fills, fairly consistently, one function- either the thing compared or the means of comparison-rarely switching from one to the other. In commenting on the categories of subject matter, I have therefore divided them into the two groups, beginning with the thing compared. Within this group, in the order of decreasing importance, are: the human, the sky, light, vegetation. Water, the animal, fabricated objects, the earth, and fire, in the same order, form the means of comparison.

Imagery portrays his feelings: "Une tentation le secouait, formidable, tourbillonnait sur lui, aussi r6elle qu'une hargne de vent" (p. 238),4 his thought: "Une seule pens6e ... violente comme une d6tente de muscles" (p. 107), his relationship with his wife: "Entre Sandrine et lui, cette rugueuse 6paisseur de pierres, comme d'un mur tout a coup dress6" (p. 232), and his situation or destiny: "Une menace multiforme, impr6cise, qui traquait Raboliot partout . . . Des rages le secouaient souvent a ne pouvoir la contempler en face, la camper devant lui, comme un etre dont on mesure la force avant de l'6treindre a pleins muscles" (p. 170). As in the preceding examples, imagery serves primarily to render concrete human emotions or abstractions, but it also describes (though less frequently) the human body. Rarely does it involve movements or sounds, however.5 One exception is the glance, which it presents as an act, instrument, or means of poaching: "Capter d'un stir regard, comme d'un coup de filet" (p. 28). Poaching is important. The frequency of imagery in general tends to increase during the scenes of poaching. And the image of the hunter/ hunted provides the plot: Raboliot, the hunter of animals, becomes the one hunted by the gendarmes. It probably also explains the choice of his name, for Raboliot means "wild rabbit" in the local dialect.6 Individual 31</page><page sequence="4">images of the hunter/hunted show to what degree his reactions are instinctive, like those of an animal, drawing him even nearer to the creatures he is stalking.7 Most of the imagery pertaining to the other characters portrays their relationship to the protagonist, bringing out especially the personal- ity traits which produce conflict: "Volat ... 6tait, a cet instant, comme un aspic qui se chauffait a l'aise, benoitement lov6 au soleil, et A qui, tout d'un coup, l'on avait march6 sur la queue" (p. 91). The sky The second most important subject of comparison is the sky, although in over-all frequency of appearance it drops to between one- third and one-half of that of the human. It is covered, often with clouds: "La nuit 6tait incroyablement noire, bourree de nuages 6pais qui com- blaient tout le ciel de leurs 6normes ecroulements" (p. 248). It is solidified or liquefied: "Entre de grandes plages de nu6es blanches, des lacs bleu noir palpitaient d'6toiles" (p. 261). Things hang from it: "Des chevelures de bouleaux qui pendaient dans le ciel" (p. 286), or they press against it: "Les grands pins maritimes dont les cimes denses et sombres se pres- saient sur le ciel de nudes blanches" (p. 21). Imagery thus tends to hide the sky, or to render it heavy and oppressive. Light The sun itself is not important, but its light and that of the moon are. And light is, in every instance, the thing compared. It is most often liquefied: "La lumiere 6tait verte qui bougeait aux croisees, onduleuse et flambante par les soleils du plain 6t6, ruisselante par les jours pluvieux, parfois aussi, quand les hivers bloquaient le couvercle du ciel, immobile et stagnante, d'un glauque aussi glacial et morne que celui d'un abime marin" (pp. 116-17). Sometimes it is solidified: "L'6tang obscur oil brillait ... une 6caille de clart6 nacr6e (p. 261). Occasionally, it is related to fire, as in "flambante" above. Twice, it appears in a synesthetic image: "Des coups de soleil moites" (p. 206). Again, the imagery gives substance, liquid or solid, to that which has none. Vegetation Vegetation appears surprisingly low on the list of subjects of imagery.8 Images which include it accentuate the form, color, movement, or texture of trees, fields, or vegetation in general: "Des plaques de mousses velouteuses" (p. 284), "Ce ruissellement d'6meraude dore'e" (p. 286). It sometimes renders them anthropomorphic: "C'6tait la meme exube'rance, la meme confusion ve6getale, allegre, libre, d6braillke un peu" (p. 116). The imagery reveals in particular the protagonist's and the author's close affinity to the vegetable world. Miscellaneous A few of the things compared are merely general abstractions which help to create the heavy, oppressive atmosphere surrounding Raboliot and even sometimes weighing on the other characters: "Cette 32</page><page sequence="5">espece de mystere glacial, qui flottait autour d'elle [la corv6e d'hommes] comme un linceul autour d'une birette [fantome]" (p. 14).9 The Vehicle Water Water is clearly the dominant element in the imagery of Raboliot. It is also the most important means of comparison, and second only to the human being in over-all frequency of appearance.'0 It describes, first of all, light, but also the protagonist, especially his mental or emotional state: "Les souvenirs affluaient par longues vagues" (p. 241), as well as the sky, clouds, and even the earth: "Les champs moissonne6s, les labours ondulaient avec une souplesse retenue.... Les taillis ... s'infl6chissaient ... en vagues confondues que l'on sentait houler tres loin" (p. 63). In addition, it helps to form synesthetic images: "L'om- bre humide des fosse6s" (p. 306). The water which appears in the images is sometimes stagnant, such as that found in the words "6tang," "flaque," "eau noire," "mare." Stagnant water, a Bachelardian sign of death," preoccupies Raboliot when he is most depressed: "Raboliot mesura sa faiblesse. Ii s'accouda au garde-fou et pencha sa tate vers l'eau. Elle stagnait, immobile, dans la nuit terne. Les reflets pales des bouleaux y dormaient d'un sommeil fige6. Une mince tache de clarte6 frileuse venait mourir d sa surface" (p. 223). Images accentuate especially the movement of water, expressed by "ondes," "ruisseler," "glisser," "coulk'e." It is often a violent movement, as in "entonnoir," "houle puissante," "soudre," "tourbillonner."'2 Violence is a part of all of the characters-not only of Raboliot's enemies, but also of he himself. Bursting with anger against a world bent on depriving him of his greatest joy, he, like his enemies, is determined to win at all costs: "Lui non plus ne pouvait pas c6der" (p. 224). But it is a futile effort which leads to disaster. The water is ultimately one which engulfs, which submerges, as in the verbs "inonder" and "d6border." Water has a structural function in the novel. It provides the opening scene and the final image, thus framing it. The story begins with a whirlpool, in which a leaf is caught and engulfed: "Depuis la veille, l'oeillard de l'e'tang, grand ouvert, tirait: cela faisait d la surface de l'eau un entonnoir aux parois luisantes, un tourbillon tranquille et fort, si continfi- ment r6gulier qu'il apparaissait immobile. Mais, par instants, quelque feuille morte, quelque brindille de jonc dessech6e approchait avec len- teur, aspire6e d'un trait invincible, acc6l6rait son glissement peu d peu, et basculant soudain, s'engouffrait en chute vertigineuse" (p. 7). The whirl- pool, which reappears throughout the story, recalls Bachelard's claim that water "n'est plus une substance qu'on boit; c'est une substance qui boit; elle avale l'ombre comme un noir sirop. .... L'eau est ainsi une invitation a mourir."13 The fate to which the whirlpool invites Raboliot is contained in the water image closing the novel. It associates with a fountain the flowing of blood from the man whom he has just killed: "Le sang: il coulait vite, s' 6pandait en flaque sous le cadavre, et du bord de la table tombait sur le 33</page><page sequence="6">carrelage avec un bruit continu de fontaine" (p. 349). Staring at it, as if it were his own life now cleansed which is flowing away, Raboliot almost seems to experience relief to find his struggle finally ended, albeit tragically. Animals Animal imagery'4 includes mammals, birds, and, very occasion- ally, fish.'5 We have already noticed the contribution which they make to the portrayal of the protagonist, his character, emotions, and the vicious- ness of his opponents. While serving no real novelistic function, other images, in which they are the thing compared, reveal Genevoix's profound love for the animals, through vivid descriptions of their bodies: "Des oies sauvages a l'ample portail, tendu comme une proue magnifique" (p. 125) or actions: "Les nageoires pectorales vibrantes comme des embryons d'ailes" (p. 19). Fabricated objects Although it occasionally occurs as the thing compared, as in the personification of buildings: "Les batiments plats d'une ferme et des meules rondes e6parses sous leur coiffe" (p. 67), the fabricated object serves primarily as a means of comparison. The largest group within this category consists of domestic objects, and half of them are coverings, such as cloth, canvas, or tablecloths, which solidify light and water or hide the sky: "Les deux nuages ronds ... 6talaient dans le ciel un voile plat" (p. 300). Some fabricated objects have more decorative functions, evoking movements: "Les pattes veloces [des perdrix] qu'un m6canique semblait mouvoir" (p. 242), form: "Les ailes [des perdrix] en faucille, le corps rond comme une balle" (p. 206), or texture: "Les pommettes plaquees d'un parchemin grisitre" (p. 15). The earth Rocks and minerals contribute the largest number of earth images. Their hardness and weight describe the human body: "Un front dur comme un caillou" (p. 24), emotions: "Son coeur, dans sa poitrine, pesait comme un caillou" (p. 235), temperament: "Cette t6nacit6 mechante, cette duret6 de caillou lanc6 roide" (p. 221). Occasionally, they decorate natural phenomenon: "La Sauldre ... luisait d'un 6clat d'6taim" (p. 202). Fire Fire occurs in a few rare images, such as those mentioned above describing light, and others evoking flashing eyes: "Toute la haine qui luisait aux yeux de Malcourtois s'exalta comme une flamme sur quoi l'on a vers6 de l'huile" (p. 209), or sensuality: "De sensualit6 complice, brulante comme braise" (p. 33). But it becomes important only at the end of the story when Raboliot's longing for his family becomes even stronger than his prudence, causing him to walk into a trap. The scene is described as follows: "C'6tait un matin de juillet, ruisselant g l'infini d'une lumibre splendide et shche. Le soleil d6j~i haut avait bril6 toute la ros6e; I'espace n'6tait qu'un flamboiement limpide, sans une trace de brume, sans un 34</page><page sequence="7">nuage" (p. 332). On the level of the action, the sun's intense rays reveal him to his enemies, but symbolically, its fire may also signify the force of his desire for home. Miscellaneous A number of images solidify something, especially the air, or make concrete emotions or abstractions, by means of nothing more than a noun or adjective of weight: "Une pesanteur obscure de d6go~it" (p. 246), "Son ombre lourde" (p. 250), or a noun or verb of action: "Toute sa vie, telle qu'elle s'6tait tissee" (p. 312), "Le d6chirement d'un nuage" (p. 223). General Characteristics of the Imagery Sensory appeal As is normal among novelists, the great majority of the images appeal to the sense of sight. They reveal especially form, movement, or brilliance. Appeals to touch are almost twice as frequent as those to sound, which is very unusual for rustic prose writers,'6 but consistent with this novel. The appeals evoke the viscous: "Clarte huileuse" (p. 63), the humid: "Des coups de soleil moites" (p. 206), the sensual: "I1 faisait tilde dans la salle de Bouchebrand, une ti6deur close qui vous p6n6trait de partout, comme le contact d'un vieux vetement" (p. 207). They contribute to the atmosphere of oppression. And they describe human behavior or emo- tions: "Le mal. C'est comme une 6pine noire dont le couton est rest6 dans la peau. Arrache l'6pine d'un coup, Raboliot, puisque tu vois oti elle te blesse" (p. 232). Synesthesia occurs in several images, the most striking of which is probably: "L'odeur chaude-amere" (p. 303). Motion In Raboliot, verbs and verbal nouns have a particular quality to them. They designate that which is flowing, hanging (mainly from the sky), capturing, pressing, penetrating, tearing, as in: "Sa vie ... le torturait comme d'un 6cartelement" (p. 311), or else that which is dizzy, turbulent, out of control: "I y eut une seconde suspendue, oti tourbillonn rent des pensees en rafales" (p. 39). Violence is what is most characteristic of the action. The Protagonist In summary, imagery in Raboliot tends generally: 1) to render concrete human emotions or abstractions, 2) to reveal the animal in man, 3) to plug up the sky, 4) to give substance to air and light, 5) to dissolve, 6) to emphasize stagnation, humidity, viscosity, and, occasionally, sensu- ality, 7) to create a dark, heavy, oppressive, dismal atmosphere, or a threatening and violent one. For the most part, it is functionally integrated into the novel and necessary to our understanding of the protagonist, his character, mental- 35</page><page sequence="8">ity, and destiny, as well as his perception of the social and physical environment in which he lives. The high frequency of appearance of Raboliot himself in images as compared to other subjects, is indicative. Even images involving something not related to him, like the sky or light, contribute to our impression of his feeling himself trapped, stifled, threat- ened by a fate whch he does not fully comprehend and from which he cannot escape, a fate determined as much by his own inner being as by his situation and the actions of others. Raboliot is a simple man, driven by an uncontrollable, animal-like drive to poach, a drive so strong it draws him away from his home. His wife, of a submissive nature, is too weak to control him, which he himself recognizes and regrets, and which gives him a feeling of solitude and helplessness. His life is not centered around the home-under the Bache- lardian sign of fire-but around simple, hidden, internal forces-a water sign: "L'eau-66lment plus fe6minin et plus uniforme que le feu, 6l6ment plus constant qui symbolise avec des forces humaines plus cachees, plus simples, plus simplifiantes."'7 Indeed, the thought of water gives him a sense of well-being. And he likes the night and moon. He is drawn to them, of course, because of his nocturnal hunting, but also because of his character. They, too, are part of a water mentality.'s The destiny which hangs over him is the result not only of his desire to poach, but also of his pride, stubbornness, and quick temper, as well as of the vicious, vengeful, and malefic nature of his opponents. Each day brings him closer to it, each day's suffering is a form of death. And his inability to comprehend fully what is happening to him creates a mounting anxiety, dizziness, and loss of contact with reality: "Des ondes tildes tournent autour de lui, s'6largissent et renaissent sans trove; c'est comme un vertige grandissant" (pp. 227-28). His reaction conforms perfectly to a "watery" being: "L'Utre voue ' l'eau est un etre vraiment en vertige. Il meurt d chaque minute, sans cesse quelque chose de sa substance s'6croule .... La mort quotidienne est la mort de l'eau.... La peine de l'eau est infinie."19 At moments, Raboliot seems to need his destiny: "Un renoncement affreux qui coulait en lui comme de l'eau, ne lui laissant au coeur qu'un grand besoin d'etre vaincu" (p. 170). In the wilderness, free, he can hunt to his heart's content, but, in the end, no longer finds pleasure in it. He even once surprises himself missing his archenemy with all of his meanness and the ever present hostility. So violence itself eventually becomes a necessary part of his life, regardless of the consequences, as his final act reveals, and as he himself almost foresees: "I1 y a dans chaque homme un etre qui se cache, que personne ne peut d6couvrir, pas meme l'homme qui le cache en soi. Raboliot, g certaines heures, avait I'angoisse et la crainte de lui-m-me:'De quoi est-ce que je suis capable, allons?"' (p. 169). Bachelard gives the following interpretation of his character, based on the scenes of viscosity: Il suffira de relire dans le livre de Maurice Genevoix, Raboliot, les pages consacr~es aux gluaux pour vivre une offensivit6 d(taillke, minu- 36</page><page sequence="9">tieuse, qui donne une mesure de la reactivit6 de l'existence humaine (pp. 138-139). Gluaux, appeaux, pipeaux se designent dans des concordances qui dominent les impressions premieres, les existences de soumission aux inexistants. L'exemple est d'ailleurs bon pour distinguer l'inconscient masculin et l'inconscient fe'minin; ou plut6t, maniant offensivement le visqueux, on abandonne les couches plus profondes de l'inconscient, a savoir l'inconscient-type, l'inconscient essentiellement feminin et, avec la plus molle des armes, on suit les excitations deji conscientes de l'offensi- vit6 masculine. Nous entrons bien dans le domaine d'une volonte insidieuse, mais deja tenace qui tourne a son profit les forces les plus diverses. L' tre humain devient ainsi un centre d'hostilite. Sa prodigieuse offensivite ne laisse rien inactif dans l'univers des forces. Qu'une force se revele dans une substance, la question premiere est alors: contre qui, contre quoi peut-elle agir? Le visqueux v6cu par l'homme cherche un ennemi. On n'en voit pas le dynamisme en s'offrant comme une victime.20 The degree to which Raboliot is dominated by the appeal of violence is evident not only in the viscosity, but in the imagery as well. So, also, is his obsession with death: the stagnant and engulfing water, the turbulent, dizzy movement. Dissolution through liquefaction, which, according to Bachelard, "nous aide a' mourir totalement,"21 is another sign of this obsession. Raboliot, the "wild rabbit" who poaches, becomes a self-poacher. Conclusion The preceding study has revealed a water archetype which eluci- dates the mentality of Raboliot, but not necessarily that of the author.22 Although he uses the narrator's point of view to present the images- except for those involving poaching, which might well occur to the protagonist-they convey to us the latter's ontology more than his own. We become aware of Genevoix's love for the animals, and we can sense his sympathy for his main character. But sympathy for the man is different from acceptance of his hostility. His personal aversion to all kinds of violence is clear from his other writings. We know that he conforms to a water archetype. Jean Bastaire23 claims so, and water is far too much a part of his other works to deny it. But a quick glance at the images of La Loir, Agnes et les gargons-the novel in which water is important enough to head the title-suffices to discredit any claim that his archetype corresponds to that of Raboliot. Here, water is the thing compared more frequently than the means of comparison. It is rarely violent or turbulent (except during one episode, when it comes close to causing the death of a character). Its mirror qualities--rather than its depth-are emphasized, often in images which associate it with the sky, helping to create an atmosphere of lighthearted- ness and freedom consistent with the feelings of the young men in the story. Even the sky is usually clear and pure, or, if there are clouds, they are transparent. This reveals Genevoix's world view to be much more balanced than the one we find in Raboliot.24 37</page><page sequence="10">So the characters of the works determine the vision, and thus, to a large extent, the images. Genevoix is aware of this, as we see from the following quotation, taken from the introduction to La Loire, Agnes et les garqons, in which he explains why he wished to write another, nonfiction work, La Bofte d peche: "J'ai voulu voir, peindre, chanter, aimer La Loire selon mes yeux, mes sens, mon coeur, sans interposition de personnages romanesques, sans tiers, sans fiction, sans 6cran, sans quoi que ce ftit d'6tranger."' An analysis of the images in Raboliot shows how artfully the author adapts them to the individual selection, making them serve truly novelistic functions. They are twice a part of the structure; they help to create an atmosphere appropriate to the plot and protagonist; they give concrete form to the latter's psychology. Genevoix's images exemplify a very successful prosaic conversion of a device often used to poetize narrative writing.26 Bowling Green State University NOTES 1. Participation in the NEH seminar "Poem and Metapoetics," with Mary Ann Caws, at the CUNY Graduate Center, Summer, 1978, gave me the opportu- nity to do the research for this paper. 2. See esp. Georges Roger, "Un 6quilibre classique: Raboliot de Maurice Genevoix," in Maftres du roman de terroir (Paris: A. Silvaire, 1959), pp. 132-41; and Paul Vernois, "L'Homme consubstantiel " la terre: Raboliot et Maurice Genevoix," in Le Roman rustique de George Sand a Ramuz. Ses tendances et son dvolution (1860-1925) (Paris: Nizet, 1962), pp. 327-35. 3. Determination as to what constitutes an image sometimes requires an arbi- trary decision, so that my total count may vary from that of another critic. However, such variations should not alter the most notable characteristics of the imagery. I have considered as a separate image each metaphor or simile which produces a different association. When a series of metaphors or similes continue to develop the same association, only one image is counted. This also sometimes requires an arbitrary decision, and is another reason why my total count may differ from that of another critic. It also results in a considerably larger number of tenors and vehicles than of images and accounts for the disparity which sometimes appears between the per- centage of images in which a given subject may appear and the percentage of tenors and vehicles referring to it. Stephen Ullmann defines the tenor as "the object or idea we are talking about," and the vehicle as "the term to which the tenor is likened." Style in the French Novel (London: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1957), p. 214. 4. All page references are to Raboliot (Paris: Grasset, 1925). 5. This is rare among rustic novelists. In the works of both Jean Giono and C.-F. Ramuz, for example, the human's most important contribution to the imagery is through his body, including both actions and sounds. 6. J.J. Walling, "Raboliot: A Major French Regional Novel," Modern Lan- guages, LV:4 (Dec., 1974), 183. 7. Paul Vernois also points out the hunter/hunted theme and the likening of Raboliot to the animals he tracks. (Le Style rustique dans les romans champe- 38</page><page sequence="11">tres apr~s George Sand, problames de nature et d'emploi, Paris: Presses Univ. de France, 1963, p. 175). 8. This is inconsistent with Genevoix's well-known love of the vegetation of Sologne. 9. Vernois notes (Le Style rustique..., p. 155) that this is a folkloric image. 10. Vernois (p. 165) is also aware of the importance of water imagery. 11. Gaston Bachelard, L'Eau et les raves (Paris: Corti, 1942), p. 190. 12. Ibid., Chapter VIII. 13. Ibid., p. 77. 14. In some cases, it is not clear whether the association is with an animal or a human: "Les troncs de pins sylvestres 6taient roses; on voyait leur sang sous l'corce" (p. 303). 15. Vernois mentions (Le Style rustique... , p. 155) that the images always place them in their physical surroundings. 16. With both Giono and Ramuz, the appeal to sound is second in importance after sight. 17. Bachelard, p. 7. 18. Ibid., p. 137. 19. Ibid., p. 9. 20.

An analysis of the imagery of any of their novels reveals much about the author's mentality. 23. "Maurice Genevoix, enfant du fleuve et des bois," Revue des deux mondes (fevrier, 1972), 337-46. 24.

Vernois claims (Le Style rustique . . . , pp. 260-63) that Raboliot is an impressionistic, poetic novel. The use of imagery as described above is, however, more prosaic than poetic.
