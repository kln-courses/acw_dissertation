<plain_text><page sequence="1">110 Josephine Jacobsen Of Pairs The mockingbirds, that pair, arrive, one, and the other; glossily perch, respond, respond, branch to branch. One stops, and flies. The other flies. Arrives, dips, in a blur of wings, lights, is joined. Sings. Sings. Actually, there are birds galore: bowlegged blackbirds brassy as crows; elegant ibises with inelegant cows; hummingbirds' stutter on air; tilted over the sea, a man-of-war in a long arc without a feather's stir. The mockingbirds are a pair. A pair touches some magic marrow, lends a curious solace. "Lovers" pretends of course an anthropomorphic care we know is specious. This is a whim of species. Nevertheless, they come. One, then the other, says what it has to say, pours its treble tricks clearer into clear air, goes; one, and the other. In the palms' dishevelment, the random day, over the green hot grass, fellow to fellow: the shadow of wings, the wing's shadow.</page></plain_text>
