<plain_text><page sequence="1">Contributions The Three Stones of Maya Création Mythology at Quiriguá1 Matthew G. Looper Recently, a number of scholars have attempted to reconstruct the Classic Maya mythology for the création of the world (MacLeod 1991; Scheie 1992; Freidel, Scheie, and Parker 1993). Central to this myth was evidently the placement of three stone thrones by various gods at the beginning of the current grand cycle of the Maya calendar 13.0.0.0.0 4 Ajaw 8 Kumk'u, which corresponds to 13 August 3114 B.C. David Freidel and Linda Scheie (Freidel et al. 1993:66-67) have compared this action to the setting of hearthstones in a contem porary Maya house. Just as the placement of these three stones in a triangular arrangement "centers" the house, making it suitable for habitation, so the setting of the three stones of création prepared the world for humanity. Although there is support for the identification of the three stones of création as hearthstones, I would suggest that this analogy reveáis only one aspect of the Classic myth. Specifically, the hearthstone reading of the three stones of création implies an équivalence among the stones which is not supported by a close reading of the Classic texts. I shall argue, in fact, that iconographie and textual evidence from Quiriguá suggest both complementary and hierarchical relationships among the stones of création. These relationships can be documented not only at Quiriguá, but also through Classic-period monuments and programs at Palenque. In none of these programs, however, do the three stones serve a purely mythopoeic funetion. Rather, the hierar chical and complementary relationships of the three stones of création were used to symbolize the ancient and divine foun dations of Maya kingship and, thus, served as a framework for political messages. Classic Maya Cosmogenesis In order to define the relationships of the stones precisely, it is essential to examine in detail the various Classic sources which describe the first moment of création. The text of Stela C of Quiriguá contains the most elabórate version of the events on 4 Ajaw 8 Kumk'u. The text begins: Chan Ajaw Waxak Ol, jal k'oj. "On 4 Ajaw 8 Kumk'u, was manifested, the image." (Scheie 1992:121-122) (Fig. la) This passage parallels the texts of Copán Stela 23, Coba S tela 1, and Piedras Negras Altar 1, as well as other Classic monuments. An unprovenienced panel illustrated by Mayer (1991: pl. 196) describes exactly what the image was: Chan Ajaw Waxak Ol ilahi yax k'oj ak chak k'u ajaw. "On 4 Ajaw 8 Kumk'u, it was seen, the first image of the turtle, great holy lord." (Scheie 1992:122-123) The Quiriguá text continues with a verbal expression consist ing of a number three followed by the "flat-hand" verb having a tun "stone" as the object (Fig. Ib). Although the precise phonetic reading of this verb is unknown, it would seem to have the sense of "présent" or "set in place." The things that are "set in place" are clearly three stones. The passage entitled "The Ritual of the Angels" from the early colonial Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel (Roys 1967) offers an account of cosmogenesis which is strikingly similar to the Quiriguá version (MacLeod 1991 ). In particular, it describes the birth of three stones. Roys (1967:107) trans lates the text as follows: Dominus vobiscum ended the words of their song when there was neither heaven nor earth. When the world was submerged, when there was neither heaven nor earth, the three-cornered precious stone of grâce was born, after the divinity of the ruler was created, when there was no heaven. The phrase Roys renders as "three-cornered precious stone" is, in fact, probably closer to the Quiriguá Stela C text than this translation suggests. In Yucatec, this phrase is rendered as ox amay tun (Roys 1967:34), and since amaytun is glossed as b) d Fig. 1. Quiriguá Stela C text. a. B5-B6; b. A7; c. B7-B9; d. A10-B11 ; e. A12-A14.

(Scheie 1992:125) Thus, the third stone, a water Rigel, oxibxk'ub, "three hearthstones," and the glowing cloud throne, was set by the deity named in the Postclassic códices that they surround, Great Nébula M42, is described as smoke as Itzam Na, or God D as he was later labeled by Schellhas trom the hearth's fire (Tedlock 1982:181-182).

The turtle and stones are shown suspended from the ecliptic instead of being hung directly from it, as the symbolic constellations in the Paris Codex "zodiac" are represented. Further support for the identification of the three stones with Orion is the appearance of the night sky on the solar day corresponding to 4 Ajaw 8 Kumk'u (13 August). Utilizing computer simulations, Linda Scheie (1992:145-146) has not ed that at approximately midnight, the constellation of Orion rose in the east, and by sunrise it was overhead. Thus, as the sun rose on the new world, the three stones of création stood nearly at zenith. The three stones at Quirigua Although the identification of the three création stones with hearthstones is confirmed by K'iche' ethnographie sources, both textual and iconographie data from Quiriguá suggest that the stones' symbolism is far more complex. First, the text of Stela C suggests that the first two stones of création have a complementary relationship. The locations where they were planted, na-ho-chaan "first-five-sky" and kab-kah "earth place", incorpórate the complementary Maya concepts of Fig 4 Quiriguá Great Plaza, detail.

These watery qualities seem to justify its équiva lence to the third stone of création, which is named in the Stela C text using the dark ened imix, reading either ha "water" (Fox and Justeson 1984) or nab "lake, body of water" (Scheie and Grube 1990). A ha' or nab name also seems to be used as part of the name of the monument, as recorded on the zoomorph's text (Fig. 8).

If this is correct, then the right half of glyph block 13, has jaguar heads, out of the mouths of which fall streams of which shows a monster wearing an elabórate waterlily head ch'ulel, or sacred energy.

Again, the on one of the Tikal bones paddling a canoë which has the front king is shown holding a bound jaguar pelt-spotted object like head of the Cosmic Monster (Fig. 9).

Thus, the Cosmic Monster iconography of Zoomorph those shown on the ends of the throne on the front of Stela A B identifies it as the third stone of création because the patron are, indeed, quite similar in appearance. The fact that the Stela (and guide) of the Cosmic Monster, Na Itzam Kaj, also was A snake heads spew ch'ulel, not deities, also suggests that the responsible for setting the third stone. bar is not the familiar double-headed serpent bar, but a throne.

Like the Stela C text, this program présents the The présentation of the accession of K'an-Hok'-Chitam in first two stones of création as a complementary pair and the the context of the third (water) throne of création suggests that third stone as hierarchically distinct.

Viewing the Cross Group from the It is significant as well that the monuments were not placed south side, the Temple of the Sun is located to the left, in a row, but were setup in a triangle (Fig. 4). This arrangement following the location of the jaguar throne on the Palace apparently replicates the arrangement of the three stars in Tablet.

The création thrones at Palenque The pattems of complementary relation and hierarchy sug gested for the three création stones as they appear in Quiriguá texts and images can be confirmed through an image on the Palenque Palace Tablet as well as through the dedication pattem and spatial Organization of the Cross Group. In the image at the top of the Palace Tablet (Fig. 6), the king K'an Hok'-Chitam of Palenque has placed his accession within a création context by depicting himself and his parents perform ing the ceremony of accession seated on bone thrones adorned with jaguar, snake, and long-nosed fish heads (Scheie 1978:58; Jones 1991:250; Scheie and Mathews 1993:125).

Spatially, the three temples of the Cross Group also replícate the hierarchical and complementary patterns of the three stones, as the Temple of the Sun and Temple of the Foliated Cross face each other and are dominated by the axially-placed Temple of the Cross.6 Conclusions The symbolism of the three stones was manipulated at Palenque and Quiriguá toward différent ends. The Cross Group at Palenque uses the stones to create a symbolically charged architectural space which sacralizes monuments relating dy nastie history. In contrast, the Quiriguá monuments link the king and his actions directly to création events through their overt symbolism as the three stones of création. Stelae C and A show Butz' Tiliw setting the first two thrones, and all of the residents of the Quiriguá polity could actually have watched him re-set the third création throne during the dedication of Zoomorph B. The Palace Tablet from Palenque uses the création myth to enhance the import of a personal, historical event, but, like the Quiriguá program, the thrones are depicted explicitly. Despite the variations between sites, the monuments and programs of Palenque and Quiriguá discussed above express the same structure in which the first two création thrones are shown to be complementary through compositional or spatial £ y&amp; ~ -^ arfiw fejfi'- % ■ ° ws. i. / Us ^M*mm k 6 Ik B| 1 B^ei fcln- --=4nMsi 1 ibaSagmMB \ssa iirnr^.ji/i to ^SwrP" | 1 «| / ftcgj' y » ^ ® ✓ j^^lff ftffli#1 iteml ^WP^lBnp^B 1W| l ? j/TW] if rM*f?

The seat or accession throne of the king, symbol ized by the third throne, is shown to be hierarchically distinct from the other two through différences in dedication timing, artistic format, or hierarchical spatial distribution and compo sition. In sum, the consistency of this pattem at these sites suggests strongly that relationships among the three stones of création was a widespread medium for expressing the funda mental qualities of Classic Maya kingship. Indeed, the place ment of the ruler's accession within the metaphor of the three stones implies that the institution of rulership was set forth at the beginning of time, through the actions of the gods.

A paper presented for a gradúate seminar at the University of Texas Notes The author wishes to acknowledge the generous support of the Instituto de Antropología e Historia of Guatemala for the research conducted at Quiriguá, the results of which are reported in this article. Research funding was provided by the National Science Foundation (#DBS 9307752) and the William J. Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board. Nikolai Grube (personal comra., 1994) has suggested that this supernatural is the same that appears as part of the name of the vision serpent named on Yaxchilán Lintel 15. The location with which the serpent is associated is similar to that at which the second stone is set on St. C. The sky god/earth god passages common in Classic texts (eg. Tikal Stela 31) confirm that the sky and earth were complementary entities in Classic thought, as well. Zhang (1990) identifies and discusses bone thrones in Maya art. Zoomorph G must also be considered a part of the north group of monuments, but, being erected between (and slightly to the south of) Stelae F and E, it does not conform to the east-to-west pattem of dedication. The explanation for this is that, as the death monument for Butz' Tiliw (Kelley 1962; Stone 1983), it was meant to seal off or "kill" the north group, not unlike the deactivation of the Palenque Group of the Cross by Temple 14. 6) Freidel, Scheie, and Parker (1993:140) have noted the correspondence of triadic architectural groups such as the Cross Group to the three stones of création. This evidence supports their contention. RESUMEN: Interpretaciones de las estelas C y A, y el zoomorfo B de Quiriguá en el contexto de la mitología de la creación del mundo de los mayas del periodo clásico. Análisis de los textos y iconografía de estos monumentos indica que las tres piedras de la mitología maya de creación no son entidades iguales, sino tienen relaciones complementarias y jerarquiales. Las estelas C y A forman una pareja que corresponde a las primeras dos piedras de creación, y zoomorfo B representa la tercera. La iconografía de la Tableta del Palacio de Palenque y la estructura espacial y iconografía asociada del Grupo de la Cruz también se manifestan las relaciones entre las tres piedras de creación. En estos programas y monumentos, el simbolismo de la tercera piedra como el tronodelreyvivantesugiereque las despiedras de lacreacióny sus relaciones fueron utilizados para expresar la fundación divina de la institución del rey. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Die Interpretation der Stelen C und A und des Zoomorphs B von Quiriguá im Kontext der Klassischen Maya-Mythologie der Erschaffung der Welt. Die Analyse der Texte und der Ikonographie der drei Monumente zeigt, daß die drei Steine der Schöpfung nicht gleichrangig waren, sondern sich gegenseitig ergänzten, und daß es eine Hierarchie zwischen ihnen gab. Die Stelen A und C bilden ein Paar in Analogie zu den ersten beiden Steinen der Schöpfung, und Zoomorph B entspricht dem dritten Stein. Die Ikonographie der Palasttafel von Palenque und die Analyse der Raumaufteilung und der Ikonographie der Kreuzgruppe läßt ebenfalls die Parallelen zur den drei Steinen der Schöpfung erkennen. Die ikonograpischen und architektonischen Programme von Palenque und Quiriguá haben gemein sam, daß sie den göttlichen Ursprung des Königtums mit den drei Steinen der Schöpfung in Verbindung bringen.</page></plain_text>
