Thanks so very much to our participating authors, artists and judges, as well as to our subscribers, donors, benefactors, patrons, advertisers, databases, and friends who sustain us. Look forward to a publication of The Best of Femspec: the First Ten Years, a forthcoming anthology of Femspec Books, and to fur ther contests. And as the editor, I would like to mention Robert von der Osten as Best Friend. True, Ritch Calvin, doing setup for the last three years and before that even a few more, was a close winner of this editor's award as well. But while cleaning out the Femspec office, I came across a Wish List Robin Reid had asked me to write at the IAFA conference in spring of 2007- It was almost as if Robert had read it, and faithfully worked his way down checking off each item. In addition to several financial donations for the last three years of significant proportions, he treated us to getting to read a few of his creative manuscripts, gave comments as an anonymous reviewer on select manuscripts, participated as a judge in this last contest, wrote the perspective of a friend for publica tion, mailed out several issues of the publication, wrote a mailing to include to encourage people to resubscribe, and once arranged for the printer after pro curing estimates. He consistently made several good suggestions as to how we could get a more solid footing, paid for a table at Pop Culture, manned a table at WisCon, found a film reviewer, looked for institutional homes and donors,</page><page sequence="4">and kept the subscription lists in order. Finally, battling with the requests for replacement copies from libraries and institutions drove Robert over the edge of his endurance. After three years, he turned in his post as Subscription Ful fillment Manager. We hope he continues to work with us in many ways.</page><page sequence="5">EXTRAPOLATION Extrapolation is an international, peer-reviewed journal which publishes articles and book reviews on science fiction and fantasy texts, broadly conceived.

Tolkien describes the three monsters of the poem as "essential, fundamentally allied to the underlying ideas of the poem." The Fantastic has many similarly integral monsters and monstrosities. But what do these monsters mean? How does the monstrous signify? The Monstrous Fantastic will explore the many creative and cultural constructions of monstrosity in the arts, from monsters of ancient times to monsters of the present and future. Conference participants may propose papers, propose and organize panel discussions, give readings, or participate in other ways. We encourage papers on our honored guests.
