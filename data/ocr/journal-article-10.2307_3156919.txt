They (the imprecations) shall precipitate this man into the water; they shall bury him in the ground; they shall cause him to be overwhelmed with stones; they shall burn him with fire; they shall drive him into exile into places where he cannot live. May Anu, Bel, Nouah, and the Supreme Lady, the great gods, cover him with absolute confusion, may they root up his stability, may they efface his posterity ! May Marduk, the great lord, the eternal chief, fasten him up with unbreaka- ble chains! May the Sun, the great judge of heaven and earth, pronounce his condemna- tion, and take him in his snares ! May Sin, the illuminator, who inhabits the elevated regions, catch him in a net like a wild ram captured in the chase; like a buffalo whom he throws to the ground by taking him in a noose! May Ishtar, queen of heaven and earth, strike him in the presence of gods and men, and entice his servants to perdition ! May Adar, the son of the zenith, the child of Bel, the supreme, destroy the limits and the boundary of his property ! May Gula, the great lady, the spouse of the winter Sun, pour inside him a deadly poison; may she cause his blood and sweat to flow like water! May Bin, the captain of heaven and earth, the son of Anu, the hero, inundate his field! May Serakh destroy the firstfruits of his harvest * * * may he enervate his animals! May Nebo, the supreme intelligence overwhelm him with affliction and terror, and lastly may he hurry him into incurable despair!

One must believe in the existence of a Creator, be he blessed, i. e., that the Existent is perfect in all his existence and is the cause of all things that exist, and that they derive their existence only from him. .His non- existence is impossible, as without his existence nothing else can exist. But if ieven nothing besides him should exist, his existence can not cease. He alone, whose name be blessed, is one and Lord for he is all-perfect and all-sufficient, having no need of any other being; but all other beings, as angels, the spheres, and all which is therein, as also all that is beneath them, are depending on him. This first article is taught by the words, "I am the Lord thy God." (Exod. xx., 2.) 2. The Unity of God, whose name be blessed, we must believe: that the Cause of all is one, not like one of a pair, of a species, or like one man which can be divided into many, or like one body that can be divided into parts infinite, but that God is one like no other one. This second article is taught by the words, "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord," (Deut. vI., 4.) 3. The immateriality of God we must believe, that this one is not matter, nor possesses any properties of matter, as motion and rest, either in essence or attributes. Therefore have our wise men divested him of composition and 83</page><page sequence="2">THE OLD TESTAMENT STUDENT. division, as they said (Chaguiga, fol. 15)," There is in heaven neither sitting nor standing.'" The prophet said also (Isa. XL., 25), " To whom then will you liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One." But all that is said in holy Scriptures of God's going, standing, sitting and speaking is anthropomorphic. And thus said our wise men of blessed memory. The law speaks in the language of men. Our wise men have said much on this subject. This third article is taught us by the words (Deut. iv., 15), "For you saw no manner of similitude," which means, ye have not perceived him to be anything like matter, or as having the properties of matter, as we mentioned above. 4. We must believe in the absolute preexistence of God, and that nothing existed before him. The passages of Scripture showing this are many. This fourth article is taught by the words (Deut. xxxiII., 27), "The eternal God is thy refuge." 5. The blessed God alone is worthy of worship, praise and obedience; nor may we worship anyone beneath him in existence, as the angels, spheres, ele- ments, or anything composed of them. For they are subject to divine laws, and are not free agents. Nor are they to be worshipped as mediators to bring us near to God. But all our thoughts should go direct to him, and to none else besides him. This fifth article is the prohibition of idolatry, which is very frequently spoken of in Scripture. 6. We must believe that there are some men possessing such qualities, and such perfections that their souls are fit for the reception of supernatural conceptions. Such are prophets, and this is prophecy and its nature. To give a proper and full explanation of this article would be too long a task, neither will I give any proof of it, as it requires a knowledge of all the sciences. I speak of it only as a fact, and many passages of holy Scripture bear witness that prophecy and prophets existed. 7. We are to believe that the prophet Moses was the father of all the prophets that were before him, or after him. All prophets were inferior to Moses, as he was the best of mankind and reached to a knowledge of the God- head to which no other man ever attained. And we must believe that he in his manhood attained the excellence of angels, that he overcame every hin- drance, so that no bodily weakness was in his way; the common human de- sires, feelings and perceptions disappeared and there remained but the sense of the soul; wherefore it is said of him, "He spoke with God without inter- mediate angel." It was in my heart to explain this wonderful subject and to unlock the closed passages of Scripture; to explain the meaning of "mouth to( mouth" (E. V. face to face) and the like about the prophetic state of Moses. But I saw that it would require numberless proofs and many introductions and preliminaries. I should first have to speak of the existence of angels, and how they differ from God; then about the nature and properties of the soul. The treatment would have to be enlarged to explain what the prophets said con- cerning God and angels. And even all these would scarcely suffice; so that if I were to write a hundred sheets it would not be enough. I will therefore leave it for a book of Sermons which I intend to write, or for a commentary on the prophets now in preparation, or for a separate book which I intend to com- pose on these articles. I will now return to the meaning of this seventh ar- ticle, and show that Moses's nature of prophecy differed from all others in four points. First, God's communication to any other prophet was through some 84</page><page sequence="3">CONTRIBUTED NOTES. medium, but to Moses it was direct, as it is said (Num. xII., 8), " With him I will speak mouth to mouth." Secondly, to any other prophet the prophecy comes either when he is asleep, in a dream or vision; or when awake, some dizziness falls upon him, so that all his bodily powers are suspended as in a dream. But Moses received God's word while standing between the Cherubim, as God appointed him: as it is said (Exod. xxv., 22) "And I there will meet with thee" (Num. xII., 8) "Mouth to mouth." Thirdly, any other prophet, although the word come in a vision or by angel, becomes weak, and a fear overtakes him as if he would die (Dan. x., 8): "And I saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me, for my vigor was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength." But Moses had none of these feelings, for it is said (Exod. xxxIi., 11), "And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend;" which means, as no man is afraid when he speaketh with a friend, so Moses had no fear though the word came direct to him; and this was because of his soul's unity with God. Fourthly, the prophecy of other prophets did not come to them at their will, but by God's will; the prophet may wait days and years asking God for a revela- tion. Some had even to apply means that the prophecy might come, as Elisha, when he said (2 Kgs. III., 15), "But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass when the minstrel played, that the hand of the Lord came upon him." And even then the prophecy did not necessarily come. But Moses said (Num. ix., 8), "' Stand still, and I will hear what the Lord will command concerning you." So it is also written (Lev. xvI., 2), " Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place;'" which our wise men have understood to mean: Aaron is prohibited, but not Moses. 8. The Law is from heaven, i. e., we have to believe that the whole Law which was given by Moses, is entirely from God's mouth; it came to Moses, speaking anthropomorphically, by God's dictation. For though we cannot conceive how it was, he nevertheless wrote by dictation. He wrote all thle history of those times, the conversations and commandments; and therefore he is called Lawgiver. And there is no difference between the passages, "The children of Ham were .Cush and Mizraim," "The name of his wife was Mahatabel," "And Timnah was the concubine," and "I am the Lord thy God," or "Hear O Israel, the Lord thy God is one God." For all came from God's mouth, and the whole Law of God is perfect, pure, holy and true. And he who says that Moses wrote such verses and narrations out of his own mind is regarded by our wise men and prophets as an unbeliever and false interpreter of the Law, because such a one thinks that the Law contains what is useful and useless, since these histories and narrations would be of no use being only of Moses; it is the same as saying, " The Law is not from God." Any one who says, The whole Law is from God except this one verse, of him it is said, " He has despised the word of the Lord." But every word of the Law contains wonderful wisdom for such as are able to comprehend it. All the wisdom that it contains will never be comprehended, as the measure there- of is longer than the earth and broader than the sea. One must only follow in the steps of David the anointed of the God of Jacob, who prayed, "Open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law!" The same is true of the traditional explanation of the Law by God, as the making of the booth, the taking of the palm branch, the blowing of the horn, making fringes (on our gar- 85</page><page sequence="4">THE OLD TESTAMENT STUDENT. ments) phylacteries, and the like. This eighth article is taught us by the words (Num. xvi., 20), "Hereby ye shall know that the Lord has sent me, to do all these works, and not out of my own mind." 9. We must believe that this Law was delivered from the Creator, whose name be blessed, and from none else; and nothing is to be added to, or diminished from either the written or oral law; as it is said (Deut. xIII., 1), " Thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it." 10. We must believe in God's Omniscience; that he knows what men do, and does not withhold his eyes from them, as they who say, God has forsaken the earth. But as Jeremiah said (xxxII., 19), " Great in council, and mighty in work; for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men." (Gen. vI., 5), "And God saw that the wickedness of men was great in the earth." (Gen. xvI., 20), "The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great." These verses teach us this. 11. We must believe that God will reward him who keeps his command- ments and punish those who transgress them. The great reward will be the world to come, and the strong punishment, the being cast off. The passage (Exod. xxxII., 32), "Yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin-well-; and if not, blot me I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written," and God answered him (ibid., 33), "Whosoever has sinned against me, him I will blot out of my book;" is a positive proof that God knows who is righteous and who is wicked, to reward the one and punish the other. 12. We are to believe that Messiah will come, and, though he tarry, to wait for him. Nor may we fix any time for his appearance out of Scriptures. Our wise men said (Sanhedrin, fol. 97), May the spirit of those who compute the time, when Messiah will come, be extinguished. We are also to believe that his glory and honor will surpass that of all other kings who have ever existed, as all the prophets,. from Moses to Malachi have prophesied. And whosoever doubts it or diminishes the Messiah's glory denies God's word which is plainly told in Num. xxiv., 17-19, and Deut. xxx., 3-10. This article includes also, that the Messiah is to be from the Davidic house and of the seed of Solomon, and any one who opposes this family denies the word of God and the word of his prophets. 13. We must believe in the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead. This article has been explained above. When any man believes these articles, and shows his belief, he is an Israelite and we are commanded to love him and to do him every good as God commanded us to love our neighbor with a brotherly love. And though such a one may commit sins because of his lust, and the evil na- ture which overcomes him, he will be punished for his transgression but he has a part in the world to come, and he is a sinful Israelite. But when one denies one of these thirteen articles he does not belong to the congregation of Israel; he denies the root, and is to be called unbeliever and heretic; he is cutting off the branches, and it is well to hate and destroy him. Of him it is said (Ps. cxxxix., 21), " Do I not hate them, 0 Lord, who hate thee?"-[Fron his Commentary on Chapter xi. of Tractat Sanhedrin, of the Mishna.] ALEXANDER MEYROWITZ.
