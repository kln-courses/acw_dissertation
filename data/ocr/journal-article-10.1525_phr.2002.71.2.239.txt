<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> “A Dynamic, Not a Static Conception”: The Conservation Thought of Roderick Haig-Brown ARN KEELING The author is a doctoral candidate in the department of geography at the University of British Columbia. In his 1961 book The Living Land, British Columbia  author and conservationist Roderick Haig-Brown offered a  detailed, two-part statement of his conservation philosophy. ÒConservation,Ó he began, is a dynamic, not a static conception. It does not mean simply hanging on to things, like a miser to his gold. It means putting them to use, seeking a valuable return from them and at the same time ensuring fu- ture yields of at least equal value. It means having enough faith in the future and the needs of future people; it means accepting moral and practical restraints that limit immediate self-interest; it means Þnding a measure of wisdom and understanding of natural things that few people have attained. Appearing in a survey of natural resources prepared for the British Columbia Natural Resources Conference, a technocratic conservation think-tank, this opening section echoed the fa- miliar utilitarian economic ethos that licensed the mastery and An earlier version of this article was presented to the North American Interdisci- plinary Conference on Environment and Community in Reno, Nevada, in Febru- ary 2000.

However, Haig-BrownÕs deÞnition abruptly changed in tone and direction: [U]ltimately, though we no longer see it in this way, [conservation] is a religious conceptÑthe most universal and fundamental of all such concepts, the worship of fertility to which man has dedicated himself in every civilization since his race began. We may well believe now that an intellectual and scientiÞc approach is more likely to succeed than a mystical one. But without moral concepts and without a sense of re- sponsibility for the future of the human race, the idea of conservation could have little meaning.1 Taken as a whole, this dichotomous deÞnition, which at- tempted to blend pragmatism with spirituality, and utilitarian- ism with morality, epitomized Haig-BrownÕs own attempts to reconcile the myriad inßuences and ideas about nature and conservation he had absorbed during thirty years of writing and study. Perhaps surprisingly for historians of environmental ideas, many elements and ideas are gathered together within this statement that are often seen as distinguishing the earlier, utilitarian conservation philosophy from later, post-material environmentalist ideas. As the foremost conservationist in British Columbia from the late 1940s to the late 1960s, the internationally known Þsh- ing writer and naturalist Haig-Brown (1908Ð1976) fought con- servation battles and promoted ecological ideas during a time of aggressive industrial expansion into the provinceÕs resource hinterland. This article explores Haig-BrownÕs conservation ideas during this period and argues that they deÞed the sharp categorizations some historians make between the philosophies underlying conservation and environmentalism. Indeed, his evolving ethos reßected the enduring inßuence of earlier con- servation ideas on later environmentalism. Drawn in part from his cultural background as a genteel English sportsman, Haig- BrownÕs ideas also reveal his keen sense of the regional identity of British Columbia and the American PaciÞc Northwest based on their shared environment and history. His example illus- 1.

For the past forty years or so, scholars have examined  the philosophical and ideological underpinnings of the early twentieth-century conservation and later environmental move- ments. The topic is important for at least three reasons. First, these ideas illustrate recent adumbrations of the age-old strug- gle to deÞne the human relationship to nature. Second, the con- servation-environmentalism divide is seen as an epochal change in that relationship, inaugurating the slow but sure diffusion of modern ecological ideas and values in Western societies. Third, some argue that the lack of historical sensibility among environ- mentalists (and the general public) inhibits a complete under- standing of how our society arrived at the current ecological crises and of the struggles undertaken by earlier generations of proto-environmentalists to forestall them.2 Samuel Hays, prob- ably the best-known and most inßuential historian of these movements, has emphasized a disjunction between earlier con- servation ideas, associated with the priorities of production and management, and later popular environmentalist ideas, which reßected consumer societyÕs concerns for ÒamenitiesÓ and aes- thetics.3 Others, such as Stephen Fox and Benjamin Kline, have also noted the splintering of the conservation movement into preservationist and utilitarian elements, although at different historical junctures. Similarly, Max OelschlaegerÕs sweeping analysis of the historical idea of wilderness draws a stark intel- 2. Samuel P. Hays, ÒA Historical Perspective on Modern Environmentalism,Ó in Samuel P.

This interpretation is rooted in the large-scale economic changes, shifts in values, and social demography of the twenti- eth century. However, as geographer Michael Williams has sug- gested in considering the shift from conservation to environ- mentalism, Òthe links and positive feedback between the two should never be forgotten.Ó6 A more complex story emerges from the particular moments, places, and personalities of the conservation movement. For example, Christopher SellersÕs recent article on ÒThe Makings of an ÔEnvironmentalistÕ Imagi- nary in the Post-World War II U.S.Ó has emphasized the im- portance of conservationÕs contexts, demonstrating how envi- ronmental activism in the 1950s and 1960s was rooted in a Òvariety of pre-existing networks, movements and subculturesÓ that Òhelp explain the later tensions and contradictions within environmentalism itself.Ó 7 Ecologist Aldo LeopoldÕs embodi- 4.

As Marilyn Dubasak has cogently argued in her comparison of Canada and the United States, Òconservation is a concept that changes over time and space.Ó 9 This variability is manifest in the evolving conservation ideas of Roderick Haig-Brown, whose philosophy was shaped in the context of the mid-century PaciÞc Coast and also inßected by his own life history and personality. After a brief biographical sketch, I identify and discuss three phases in his conservation thought: the modern sportsman ethic, critical resourcism, and ethical conservation. Rather than complete transformations, these cumulative stages represented only approximate shifts in attitude and emphasis as Haig-Brown became better informed about and experienced in environmental issues in British Co- lumbia and the PaciÞc Northwest. The trajectory they suggest, however, led from an early acceptance of utilitarian conserva- tion toward a humanistic and ecological critique of North American attitudes toward the land. The life and ideas of Haig- Brown stand as a synecdoche for the local complexity of the rapidly changing global phenomenon of the twentieth-century environmental movement.

Family connections in Seattle society circles led him to his future wife, Ann Elmore, and provided an enduring attachment to the American PaciÞc Northwest. In 1934 the Haig-Browns home- steaded near Campbell River on Vancouver Island, where they stayed until his death in 1976. He served as a personnel ofÞ- cer in the Canadian Army during World War II, as a stipen- diary magistrate for the town of Campbell River from 1941 to 1975, and as chancellor of the University of Victoria in the early 1970s. He also served on the International PaciÞc Salmon Fisheries Commission from 1970 until his death.10Haig-BrownÕs main vocation, however, was writing. He wrote twenty-eight books (four of which were published posthumously), several series of Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) radio broadcasts and historical dramatizations, contributions to na- tional historical compilations, and regular articles for publica- tions as diverse asMayfair, Field and Stream, Atlantic Monthly, and Sports Illustrated. His popular Þshing books, published mostly by U.S. and U.K. houses and written in his characteristic phi- losophical prose style, earned him comparisons to the iconic seventeenth-century Þshing writer Izaak Walton. Describing the literary stature of Haig-Brown, American novelist and essayist Thomas McGuane wrote, ÒFor those who have seen angling as a symptom of a way of living, rather than a series of mechanical procedures, the writing of Roderick Haig-Brown served as scripture.Ó 11 Described by Time in 1952 as CanadaÕs Òtop nature writer and conservationist,Ó his books had already sold more than 300,000 copies in English, German, French, and Swedish editions.12 Haig-Brown used his status as an author and ßy-Þshing authority to promote conservation.

Haig-Brown attended two Canadian national conservation conferences (in 1954 and 1961), as well as a major 1963 pollution seminar in Aspen, Col- orado, and was a recognized national expert on natural re- sources and the environment.13 Conservation was a prominent theme in his books, articles, and many public speeches. He also spearheaded British ColumbiaÕs Þrst modern environmental controversy, the unsuccessful campaign (discussed below) in the 1940s and 1950s against provincial approval of a river dam abutting Strathcona Park, near his home. Would-be conserva- tionists from around North America wrote to Haig-Brown for counsel on how to oppose developments in their own areas or to set up conservation organizations.14 Historians and biographers have downplayed or ignored Haig-BrownÕs conservation ideas because of his ambiguous ac- complishments as an activist. A literary biography by Anthony Robertson has explored Haig-BrownÕs attitudes toward nature through his literary output, devoting only a short section to conservation activities.15 Others have portrayed Haig-Brown as politically ineffective. Examining early writings by Haig-Brown and his Strathcona Park activism, Yasmeen Qureshi has charac- terized his ideas as an ÒEnglish sporting ethicÓ that blended pragmatism and romanticism but Òdid not attack the essentials of the political/economic system, so it was acceptable to the po- litical, academic and even industrial elite of British Colum- bia.Ó 16 Likewise, Haig-Brown biographer E.

Trapped in his class-bound, rural, romantic notion of nature, Metcalfe has ar- gued, Haig-Brown failed to develop the revolutionary ecologi- cal critique that marked the Greenpeace-led environmental movement.17 A closer examination reveals that Haig-BrownÕs conserva- tion ideas and activities make him a more important and com- plex Þgure than these authors have suggested. Haig-BrownÕs personal journey, from Dorset to the farthest edge of European culture in North America, profoundly inßuenced his peculiar brand of conservation. For instance, while he became passion- ate about North American wilderness, he could be savagely critical of the frontier society he lived in, with its political boos- terism and seeming disregard for natureÑeven publicly de- claiming, on one occasion, ÒI hate British Columbia.Ó 18His own cultivated, rural English conservatism kept him somewhat aloof from B.C. society, even while he admired the spirit and deter- mination of its settlers and resource workers. As a cultural Þgure occupying the geographical and political margins, how- ever, Haig-Brown used his position to critique provincial, na- tional, and even North American society generally, on issues from the treatment of Native Canadians to education to pollu- tion. Because of his acclaim, he commanded media attention in both Canada and the United States, a pulpit from which he preached his conservation ideals. An incipient bioregional sensibility resonates through Haig-BrownÕs activities and writings, marking his importance as a PaciÞc Northwesterner. Although he did not espouse an ex- plicitly bioregionalist environmental ideology, he displayed a place consciousness and sensitivity to the interconnected human-environment networks of the region.19 In addition to 17.

The author once noted, ÒWhen I am south on Puget Sound I feel a pride of ownership and partnership . . . . It is a pride of belonging, of knowing that the people who live among these waterways and forests and mountains will have an un- derstanding and warmth for me, as I have for them.Ó 20 Haig- BrownÕs lifetime of work and play in the streams and forests of the PaciÞc Northwest permeated his conservation ideas. Although a patriotic Canadian embroiled chießy in domes- tic conservation battles, Haig-BrownÕs inßuence transcended the international boundary through his writing and his love of Northwest nature. This regional sensibility found American reciprocation in Oregon journalist and historian Stewart Holbrook (1893Ð 1964), with whom Haig-Brown appeared as coauthor of a re- gional travelogue.21 Like Haig-Brown, Holbrook, a Vermonter, was a high school dropout who arrived in the region in 1920 ini- tially as a sojourner. In a reversal of Haig-BrownÕs life path, Hol- brook labored in B.C. logging camps for three years before moving to Portland, Oregon, to take up writing full time, even- tually becoming a nationally known raconteur of local history and logging life in the PaciÞc Northwest. Historian Robert Ficken has noted that ÒThe insights and much of the material that would animate subsequent writings were gathered in this period.Ó 22 Holbrook explicitly included British Columbia in his writing on the Northwest, whether celebrating the Òmajestic gloomÓ of the Douglas Þr forests or exploring the regional signiÞcance of the Columbia River.

The modern sportsman ethic Even before his career as an angling author, Haig-BrownÕs early inßuences imbued him with a rural sportsmanÕs attitude and sense of duty toward nature. Fishing and conservation be- came two sides of the same coin for the young Haig-Brown. His father, a genteel ÒscribblerÓ of articles for the sporting press, provided his sonÕs Þrst outdoors experiences on the chalk streams of Dorset before his death in World War I, when the boy was nine years old. The youngsterÕs sporting education was completed by a family friend, Major H. M. Greenhill, with the private shooting and Þshing lands of his motherÕs wealthy fam- ily as the classroom. Haig-Brown self-consciously absorbed the English rural naturalist tradition of Walton and the Selborne cleric and naturalist Gilbert White, a value system that, Òroughly deÞned . . . means self-respect, respect for others, good and de- cent conduct in private and public affairs, and . . . implies an in- tegrated sense of self.Ó 24 Haig-BrownÕs lifelong distaste for cities and his promotion of the ethics of sport testiÞed to his embrace of these precepts. The English amateur natural history tradition stimulated and framed Haig-BrownÕs appreciation of the natu- ral world, including his own amateur biological studies. As his- torian Keith Thomas has noted, this tradition represented a counter-current to the increasingly scientiÞc, mechanistic, and utilitarian views of nature in early modern England and pro- vided a cultural foundation for popular environmentalism in both England and North America.25 23.

Amateur natural history interests inspired his animal biographies, Silver (1931), Panther (1934), and Return to the River, as well as (unrealized) plans for a natural history survey of Vancouver Island.26 The animal books, written for young readers, reßected the inßuence of anthropomorphic nature writers such as Edward Thompson Seton and Charles G. D. Roberts but incorporated Haig- BrownÕs growing awareness of ecological interdependence and the threat to natural systems posed by industrial development.27 Another early book, Pool and Rapid (1932), illustrated Haig- BrownÕs early anxieties about development, portraying the settlement, clearing, and eventual hydroelectric development of a Þctional Vancouver Island river. Its conclusion, which ac- cedes to the need for development, prompted Haig-Brown to keep the book out of print after the 1936 edition.28 In any case, at the sparsely settled frontier of industrial society in British Co- lumbia, the need for conservation or wilderness protection probably seemed distant to Haig-Brown, as it did for most in the region. Already an accomplished Þsherman and ßy-tier, Haig- Brown offered his earliest direct statements on conservation af- ter his shift to nonÞction sports writing in the mid-1930s. He fused amateur biology with angling culture in The Western Angler (1939), at the time the best guide to PaciÞc Coast recreational Þshing and a recognized classic in the genre. It included a  section on ethics and conservation, which Haig-Brown deÞned in terms of the Òdevelopment of the game Þshery.Ó He ex- pressed concern over industrial threats to the resource and  the ÒdespoliationÓ of scenery.

Re- search for The Western Angler put Haig-Brown in contact with biologists at the PaciÞc Biological Station and probably inßu- enced his Þrst ecological piece, ÒConservation and Balance,Ó which reßected a sportsmanÕs view of the Òbalance of nature.Ó In it, Haig-Brown, like Aldo Leopold in the 1930s, advocated pred- ator control and management for desired game species, even while acknowledging natureÕs ÒinÞnite number of separate ex- istences, all inÞnitely interwoven, all balancing, controlling or inßuencing each other.Ó31 Like Leopold, he moved away from advocating predator control but continued to insist that the principle of the balance of nature entailed active duties on the part of humans to preserve natural habitat and conditions. ÒThis respect for the ÞshÕs environment,Ó Haig-Brown wrote in A Primer of Fly Fishing (1964), Òimplies not merely a concern for such things and a desire to protect them, but a positive affection for the whole natural world and a deep desire to understand it.Ó 32 As a member and supporter of the sportsmanÕs lobby, Haig-Brown helped provide an important foundation for con- servation ideas and initiatives in British Columbia and the 29.

As literary critic Allan Pritchard has noted, a Wal- tonian, ÒAnglicanÓ strain of thought runs through his Þshing and outdoor works, emphasizing civility, community, balance, and moderation, rather than utopian, apocalyptic, or romantic ideas of nature.33 This intersection of conservation and sportsmanship has been explored by historian John Reiger, who has placed sports- men at the vanguard of American conservation in the eigh- teenth century. He has noted the Anglophilic origins of the ÒsportsmanÕs codeÓ like the one espoused by Haig-Brown and has argued that it formed the nucleus of a conservation philos- ophy embracing not only game protection but also an over- arching concern for the natural world.34 Thomas Dunlap  has also noted that wildlife conservation formed an impor- tant foundation for the development and diffusion of eco- logical ideas throughout North America in the early twentieth century.35 ReigerÕs insistence on sport as a fount of proto- environmentalist activity may be overdrawn, but it is at least partly conÞrmed in the ideas of Haig-Brown. From his earliest writing to the posthumously published survey of Canadian freshwater Þsheries, Bright Waters, Bright Fish (1980), Haig- Brown linked outdoor recreation activities with both a scientiÞc understanding of nature and an Òethic of land, air and water.Ó 36 Sport also provided Òways of Þnding or recovering the sense of 33.

Although he never repudiated sport, the aging naturalist took up skin diving in order to observe his beloved Þsh in their own element, and he hunted rarely.38 As passionate as he was about Þshing, Haig-Brown often portrayed the activity as merely a vehicle for contemplation of the natural world and for meditation on humansÕ place in it. ÒReally [Þsh- ing] was only to see and know [the Þsh], and through them somehow to become more intimate with the land about the streams their presence graced.Ó 39 Even before the 1960s, Haig- BrownÕs social conscience prompted a consideration of the broader issue of resource conservation beyond the narrow con- cerns of habitat preservation for game. Nevertheless, the form- ative inßuence of sporting ethics remained with the author, even as he stepped from the stream bed into the limelight of public conservation battles. Critical resourcism The rising tide of conservation concerns in British Colum- bia soon overßowed the genteel sportsmanÕs perspective, chal- lenging Haig-Brown to engage with the social and political as- pects of conservation. Beginning in the late 1930s, the province experienced an upsurge in industrial resource development, culminating in the explosive growth of wartime timber harvest- ing and Þshing. With the publication of a government report on declining forest resources in 1937, conservation became a seri- ous forestryconcern, and chief foresterE. C.Manning promoted 37.

Haig- Brown belonged to an elite, mock-cabalistic ßy Þshing group composed of academics and industrialists, and he often spoke of ßy Þshing as a cultivated activity; see Metcalfe, A Man of Some Importance, 178. However, he also widely promoted democratic access to and enjoyment of the outdoors. 38.

The article also promoted the preservation activities of a ßedgling lobby group, the B.C. Natural Resources Conserva- tion League, and expressed dismay at the overcutting of timber to feed the war machine. In his criticisms, however, Haig-Brown carefully maintained a utilitarian stance: Ò[T]he conservation- istÕs object is not to conserve for the sake of conservation, but to conserve for use.Ó 41 Although interrupted byhis wartime service, an increasing stream of letters and articles from Haig-Brown served notice that conservation was Òa voice beginning to be heard in this land.Ó 42 It was a voice that struggled to deÞne con- servation and promote protected areas in his adopted country from within the progressive, pro-development mainstream and was based on a kind of transplanted English sporting ethic. The sportsmanÕs vision of conservation as a balance be- tween proper use and civil behavior would become further strained after World War II.

Ontario con- servationist Ernest Newton-WhiteÕs short-lived Canadian Con- servation Association operated during the war, and a 1954 national conference, which Haig-Brown attended, brought to- gether conservationists from across the country. Haig-Brown also joined a group of bureaucrats, industry leaders, and aca- demics who formed the B.C. Natural Resources Conference, a kind of think-tank for technocratic conservation initiatives. By and large, these groups embraced what Oelschlaeger has called Òresourcism,Ó the idea that the natural world is Òan environ- ment, a stockpile of matter-energy to be transformed through technology, itself guided by market and theoretical economics, into the wants and needs of consumer culture.Ó Oelschlaeger has argued that resourcism is incompatible with preservation- ism because it Òis bereft of any archaic sense of wilderness as the Mother Earth, of any Romantic sense of the connection of hu- man purpose with nature, and of a Leopoldian sense of value in the wilderness.Ó 45 While Haig-Brown found himself battling environmental degradation by working within these ÒresourcistÓ institutions, his conservation statements defy OelschlaegerÕs too-neat cat- egories. On the one hand, Haig-Brown described parks and wilderness in terms of Òrecreational resourcesÓ that deserved consideration in development decisions; on the other, he ar- gued that, as a resource, recreation yields the intangible beneÞts of spiritual renewal and appreciation of natureÑpre- cisely the elements Oelschlaeger maintains were excluded from the resourcist calculus.

Attempts to reconcile recreation, development, and intan- gible values formed the core of Haig-BrownÕs presentations to the roughly annual B.C. Natural Resources Conference meet- ings in the 1950s.

He was frustrated by the delegatesÕ lack of attention to nonmaterial val- ues and the social importance of recreation and wildlife.49 Haig-Brown was particularly torn by the incursion of expert planning into wilderness and parks. In some of his conference papers and elsewhere, he called for planned government inter- vention to foster parks and recreation, as well as to protect speciÞc ecological areas.50 But he also compared managed rec- reational resources to the Òpneumatic ladiesÓ of Aldous Hux- leyÕs Brave New World, and he derided the sterile approach of wildlife biologists to conservation. Haig-Brown was horriÞed when game managers proposed to measure the relative utility of recreational lands by gauging the Òsatisfaction derived per animalÓ and to engineer the maximum possible ÒharvestsÓ of game. Rather, he asserted that sport Òhas its own special mysti- cism, and its satisfactions are largely dependent on these things, not on the crop or on any tangible returns.Ó51 In an article en- titled ÒThe Biologist and the SportsmanÓ (1964), he argued that, while biologists contributed useful information about the natural world, their scientiÞc management schemes offered no more protection for wildlife than the sportsmanÕs ethical code: ÒThis is what sport is all about, and why it still holds a place in the affairs of civilized man.Ó 52 Outside the conference, Haig-Brown promoted the pro- tection and stewardship of recreational resources as a unique 49.

As an author, Haig-Brown enjoyed his most productive and inßuential years during this period, publishing seven books be- tween 1949 and 1959, including the ThoreauvianMeasure of the Year (1950) and three of his popular FishermanÕs quartet. He brought this literary renown to bear during the Buttle Lake controversy of the early 1950s, which severely tested his resour- cist ideas and forever tainted his view of politicians. In the late 1940s a government utility, the British Columbia Power Com- mission, announced plans to dam the Campbell River to gener- ate electric power for industrial use. A dam at the mouth of Lower Campbell Lake was proposed Þrst and then, in 1950, an- other that would raise the level of Buttle Lake in Strathcona Park, in Haig-BrownÕs own backyard.

Haig-Brown lived near the park and viewed it, as well as the Campbell River salmon Þshery, as a prime recreational re- source. He played a leading role in opposing the dam by con- ducting research, testifying at public hearings, and writing a se- ries of front-page newspaper articles decrying the Òmercenary vandal[ism]ÓÑthough not all developmentÑof the park.56 Haig-Brown argued that Buttle Lake represented a sample of ÒprimitiveÓ wilderness that ought to be preserved from indus- trial activity. His opponents painted him as an emotional de- fender of a Òrich manÕs playgroundÓ and an enemy of develop- ment. After ten days of public hearings in August 1951, the Campbell River dam raised Buttle Lake Þfteen feet, not forty- Þve as originally proposed, but Haig-Brown remained embit- tered by his foray into activism.57 Thereafter, Haig-BrownÕs philosophical balancing act oc- casionally collapsed into increasingly bitter exchanges with pro- development forces in the province. Industrial development in parks, his defeat in the Buttle Lake affair, and the relentless boosterism of the provincial government elicited almost pet- ulant reactions from Haig-Brown. In the midst of an other- wise innocuous economic justiÞcation for park protection, Haig Brown railed: So long as the public turns and bows three times in the direction of the nearest stock exchange at every mention of ÒprogressÓ or Òindus- trial development,Ó provincial legislators can be depended upon to make bad decisions about parks. . . . There will be hope of a compre- hensive and secure parks system in Canada the Þrst time a labor union votes to down tools because a project threatens a park, or the Þrst time an aroused citizenry mans a picket line in defence of a park.

Douglas (who corresponded with Haig-Brown) brought conservation and wilderness issues to public attention through his nature writing and conservation activities beginning in the late 1950s.63 Like Leopold, Haig-Brown drew from his sporting back- ground to articulate an ethical basis for nature conservation. Ethics and civility, core values from his English upbringing, blended with Haig-BrownÕs rural conservative ideals of commu- nity life and social responsibility to produce the moral and spir- itual outlook that dominated his conservation philosophy in his later years. In many ways, this outlook emerged from his ideas about the social role of Òrecreational resourcesÓ as sources of spiritual renewal and contemplation.

But while these inßuences provided an in- tellectual backdrop for his increasing emphasis on ethical con- servation in the 1960s, his sense of political alienation and fears of environmental crisis gave an urgency and radical tone to his conservation statements. This stage, then, represents a depar- ture from Haig-BrownÕs critical resourcism of the 1950s to a more encompassing critique of the social and cultural values that engendered the waste of resources and environmental degradation. Many of his conservation statements from this period fo- cused on the philosophical underpinnings of an environmental ethic and on how such an ethic might be achieved. The intrin- sic value of nature became a key theme in his writing and speeches, reßecting his decades in the woods and on rivers: ÒPersonally, I care very much for this conception of manÕs afÞnity with the earth, perhaps because I have found such keen and lasting pleasure in natural things myself.Ó 64 As the rapa- cious pace and effects of development increased and spread in British Columbia and Canada, Haig-Brown recognized that people, as much as policymakers, needed to Òforce the springÓ of these environmental values. Conservation called for a Òmajor change in attitude and thinking,Ó he told the Canadian Audu- bon Society in 1965. ÒWe need now an informed, considerate and ethical approach in all our citizens towards the land and all its values and creatures . . . a new sense of the meaning of the land and the purpose of society in all people.Ó 65 Haig-Brown introduced a revolutionary tone into his calls for the transformation of social attitudes, as in the conclusion toThe Living Land, where he called for the reawakening of Brit- ish ColumbiaÕs Òrebellious spiritÓ and the release of Òa spring of radical thinking, forceful enough to break through into wholly new channels.Ó 66 In a remarkable unpublished essay originally drafted for Sports Illustrated in 1966, Haig-Brown argued that Òany radical approach to conservation, to be successful, must in- clude a radical redeÞnition of economic values, a radical shift in North American purpose, and a radical redirection of the 64.

However, even his ÒresourcistÓ state- ments revealed a deepening ecological and ethical conception of conservation, such as in his 1967 speech to the PaciÞc North- west Tourist Association: ÒConservation is a universal and com- prehensive thing. Its expression and end is the intensive not extensive use of natural resources. . . . It is, above all, an attitude of mind that recognizes all the resources and the interrela- tionships between them.Ó 73 More typical of later statements was an essay linking social and ecological insights. In it, Haig- Brown reßected on the growth of environmental concern through Òthousands of small, local dramatizationsÓ to the real- ization that ÒmanÕs place, if he is to continue to have a place, must be as an integral part of the world environment, not as independent master and shaper.Ó 74 While he never used the terms, Haig-BrownÕs intertwining of the environmental, social, and economic aspects of conservation preÞgured the more re- cent concepts of environmental sustainability and sustainable development. In a statement redolent of some sustainability rhetoric, he wrote that resource developments Òwill not be eco- nomic, no matter what economists say, unless they give us the time to care for the continent as well as make use of it.Ó 75 71.

But in postwar British Colum- bia, these were vanguard ideas. Certainly, Haig-BrownÕs devel- opment of a transcendent, ethical conservation philosophy retained important elements of his sporting ethic and critical resourcism. But, as is evident from this discussion, Haig-Brown biographer Metcalfe has ignored his subjectÕs engagement with, support for, and, indeed, anticipation of the ÒcounterculturalÓ environmental movement. While Haig-Brown may not have de- veloped a fully revolutionary critique of state and capital, he consistently used his status and reputation to challenge and inßuence the pro-development opinions held by the main- stream public, an inßuence recognized at his death in 1976.76 Conclusion: Placing conservation Through forty years of writing, speeches, and activities, Haig-Brown expressed an evolving conservation philosophy that was culturally inßected, ecologically informed, and histor- ically and geographically contingent. His changing ethic folded together elements of his early English naturalist-sportsmanÕs perspective, as well as his critical resourcist phase, within an eth- ical conservation ideal that merged with the growing North American environmentalist critique of society. The contradic- tory elements and blurred phases of his thought exemplify the difÞculties of tracing the lineage of ecological ideas in the twen- tieth century. The example of Haig-Brown illustrates that, like the evolutionary force that animates the natural world, conser- vation is a dynamic, not a static conception, one that has grown and changed in response to individual, local conditions as well as larger social, political, cultural, and geographical forces. This examination suggests that the analysis of conservation and tainability and sustainable development, see Chris Maser, Sustainable Community Devel- opment: Principles and Concepts (Delray Beach, Fla., 1997); John D. Pierce and Ann Dale, eds., Communities, Development and Sustainability Across Canada (Vancouver, B.C., 1999); and Michael Healey, ed., Seeking Sustainability in the Lower Fraser Basin: Issues and Choices (Vancouver, B.C., 1999). 76.

This perspective of dynamism and change mirrors MeineÕs interpretation of Aldo LeopoldÕs life and work. Meine has noted that Òthe ÔratioÕ of utility to other values shifted as Leo- pold matured in his understanding of conservation; the useful- ness of nature was never forgotten or ignored, but was Þnally placed within the broader context provided by ecology.Ó 77 In comparing Haig-Brown with Leopold and other contempo- raries, it is notable that many conservationists whose primary concern was wildlife protection seemed most able to make the transition to the Òpost-materialÓ values of environmentalism, since the precepts of sportsmanship and wildlife appreciation already embraced the value of aesthetic and emotional aspects of nature.78 While scholars such as Oelschlaeger and David Pepper locate the lineage of ecological ideas in pre-modern organicist philosophies, they fail to note how much of the philosophy, as well as the scientiÞc knowledge and political im- petus, of modern environmentalism emanated from so-called ÒresourcistÓ conservationists and sportsmen like Leopold and Haig-Brown. Haig-Brown nurtured an increasingly radical and non- material conservation ideal even as his overtly political activities remained shaped by the repertoire of cultural ideas and in- ßuences available to him as an immigrant from England, a Þsherman-author, and a kind of latter-day frontiersman. In postwar British Columbia, he confronted a still relatively unde- veloped landscape being rapidly subjected to an industrial re- source extraction regime and a society in which few voices other than his were raised in protest. In simply labeling him a conser- vative, subsequent readings of Haig-Brown have ignored the dy- namic quality of his ideas as they relate to the course of his career and the evolution of B.C. environmental politics and policies. Indeed, the conservative and utilitarian elements of his 77. Meine, ÒThe Preservation of Utility and the Utility of Preservation,Ó 159. 78.

As the geographer David Harvey has noted, conservative conservationism Òhas its romantic side, but it can also produce a hard-headed politics of place that is highly pro- tective of a given environment.Ó 79 Haig-BrownÕs Òplace,Ó the society and environment of Brit- ish Columbia and the PaciÞc Northwest, where ecologically in- formed conservation ideas barely registered on the political scale and where the Òmyth of superabundanceÓ persisted well into the twentieth century, deeply inßuenced his literary work and conservation thought. Literary critic Glen Love has re- ferred to Haig-Brown as the regionÕs Òforemost bioregionalist,Ó and others have argued that Haig-Brown is most notable as a Òwriter of place.Ó 80 His books used the natural world of the PaciÞc region not merely as setting, but as a didactic element, a place where social and environmental lessons were contem- plated and communicated. Like William O. Douglas and Stew- art Holbrook, Haig-Brown drew ardor and inspiration from both working in and exploring the natural world of the PaciÞc Coast. The forests and streams of the region formed a deep and lasting impression on Haig-Brown, who feared they would be destroyed in the rush for spoils. As a conservationist, the drama of declining resources not only informed his attempts to con- struct workable resource conservation strategies but also Þred his ecological imagination. The ÒbioregionalÓ sentiments and activities of Haig-Brown, as well as his contribution to the ßow of conservation ideas between Canada and the United States, suggests a fruitful avenue for further research into the local and national cross-border interchanges among conservationists and environmentalists in this period.81 Such research may lead his- 79.

Roderick Haig-Brown embodied the Òworking outÓ of the contradictions within the mid-century conservation movement in a speciÞc historical-geographical setting. Like Leopold, he is a transitional Þgure, who abetted certain views and practices as- sociated with utilitarian conservation while preparing the phi- losophical ground for the post-material and ethical critiques as- sociated with contemporary environmentalism. Imbued with the strong moral perspective on society and nature gleaned from sporting ethics, his views even anticipated many of the ar- guments of contemporary sustainability advocates.
