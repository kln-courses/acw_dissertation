<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGIOUS AND SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT: AN INTRODUCTION CHRIS J. BOYATZIS BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS RESEARCH, 2003, VOLUME 44:3, PAGES 213-219 This special issue grew out of a pre-conference on religious and spiritual develop- ment (RSD), the first pre-conference of its kind at the biennial meetings of the Soci- ety for Research in Child Development. (A second meeting will be held in April of 2003.) In this introductory essay, two brief empirical arguments are presented as rationale for this issue: the neglect of social-science research on RSD, and the cen- trality and importance of religion for families and children's development. The issue includes 6 papers that vary richly in topic, methods, and levels of analysis: a con- ceptual analysis of sanctification in family relationships, a qualitative study of the role of religion in Latter-day Saints fathers who have special-needs children, a qual- itative and quantitative study of parent-child communication about religion, a struc- tural-modeling analysis of the role of religion in the positive development of a national sample of youth, a survey study of religion in college students' volunteerism, and a data-based reconceptualization of children's concepts of God. Some papers speak directly to the important issue of whether religion offers families and children bene- fits that are due uniquely to religion. Overall, the special issue offers a measure of remedy for the neglect of RSD and suggests many empirical and theoretical consid- erationsfor future scholarship on RSD. A SPECIAL ISSUE ON RELIGIOUS AND SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT T his special issue is the outcome of the inaugural pre-conference on religious and spiritual development (RSD) held at the major child development research meeting, the Society for Research on Child Development. (See Boyatzis 2001a for a sum- mary of the pre-conference.) This pre-conference in the spring of 2001 was organized to increase awareness of RSD among mainstream developmentalists and facilitate communi- cation between scholars working in different areas of RSD. The conference was organized around three major scholarly themes. The first theme was conceptual development, with papers by Jacqui Woolley (Univ. of Texas, Austin) on children's concepts of prayer, Justin Barrett (Univ. of Michigan) on children's concepts of God, and E. Margaret Evans and Melinda Mull (Univ. of Toledo) on children's naive metaphysics. The second theme focused on socialization processes and included Annette Mahoney's (Bowling Green) summary of a meta-analysis of religion in family life, Lene Jensen (Catholic Univ.) on family social- ization of religion and spirituality, and Karl Rosengren (Univ. of Illinois-Champaign) on parents' beliefs about religion and science. The third theme was on religious involvement, with talks by David Dollahite (Brigham Young Univ.) on the role of faith in Latter-Day Saint fathers with special-needs children, Carol Markstrom (W. Virginia Univ.) on religious 213</page><page sequence="2">Review of Religious Research involvement and adolescents' psychosocial development, and Katrina Phelps (W. Kentucky Univ.) on youths' religious involvement as a protective factor against delinquency. There were also roundtable discussions, facilitated by Paul Harris, Carl Johnson, Gene Roehlkepar- tain, Linda Wagener, Pam Ebstyne King, and the presenters. Rich discussions focused on mechanisms and processes of religious socialization. A central debate was whether religion functions in people's lives as merely another form of social support or if religion offers assets and benefits that are unique or special in some way that transcends more common secular forms of social support. Overall, the preconference was a helpful convening of scholars working in many different areas of RSD, and the work presented appeared to help remedy the serious neglect of an important dimension of development. IS RELIGIOUS AND SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT NEGLECTED? I recently conducted several content analyses to assess the coverage of RSD in main- stream social-science outlets to learn how much scholarship has been devoted to RSD. First, I studied four highly regarded journals of social-science research on religion: Review of Religious Research, Journalfor the Scientific Study of Religion, Journal of Psychology and Christianity, and Journal of Psychology and Theology. I studied the tables of contents of the journals' across almost a 6-year period (1996 through October, 2001). An article was counted whose title included terms related to "children," "adolescents," or "college." For titles with terms such as "family," "parenting," "marital relations," or "development," I reviewed the article to determine if children or youth were a major focus. (For example, if an article measured marital religiosity but did not address parenting or parent-child rela- tions, the article was not counted, nor if the study assessed "development" but during adult- hood only.) I did not include book reviews or articles listed under the rubrics of clinical practice or pastoral care. Of the papers published in these major journals, few were devoted to RSD. In these jour- nals, only 46 (or 6.9%) of their 666 articles focused on RSD in children, youth, or college students. The low was 4% in Review of Religious Research, the high 10% in Journal of Psychology and Theology. Note that these figures are especially low considering that the search term "college" was included intentionally to net more rather than fewer articles on youth. Other searches have yielded similar results. A recent literature review (Weaver et al. 2000) found that 11.8% of the quantitative studies published in five major adolescence jour- nals included measures of religiosity, and Dirlam et al. (1997) found that of about 200,000 Psyclnfo articles on growth and development, fewer than a quarter of one percent discussed Christianity and development. In a second content analysis, I reviewed the subject index of the most recent Handbook of Child Psychology (Damon 1998). An up-dated version of this handbook is published every 15 years or so, and it constitutes something of a "bible" in child psychology with dozens of theoretical and empirical review chapters by leading scholars. Combined, the 4 volumes of the 1998 Handbook total almost 4,700 pages. In the index of this enormous archive, there were but 3 references to "religion" and 1 to "God," and only 1 of these ref- erences was directly relevant to child behavior. I also found two un-indexed references to religion, each a paragraph long (one on Latino Catholic ideology and one on morality). The material on RSD would consume less than 1 page of the Handbook's 4,700. 214</page><page sequence="3">Religious and Spiritual Development: An Introduction In a third content analysis, I conducted searches (on December 1, 2002) on RSD research in the major databases in psychology (Psyclnfo) and sociology (Sociological Abstracts). I searched for key terms listed in the "subject" field of works published in English. Trun- cated terms were used to yield the largest number of records (e.g., "pray*" for "pray" and "prayer"; "religio*" for "religion" and "religious"). To target work on children, I entered the search terms along with the term "child*," for example "child* and God" or "child* and pray*." In PsycInfo, the subject term "child*" itself appeared in about 147,858 records. "Child* and religio " appeared in 962 or merely two-thirds of 1% (.0065) of all records on chil- dren. For comparison, child* and "family" and "parent" appeared in more than 16,000 and 33,000 records, respectively, and "school" in 13,426; "church*" appeared in 76 and "pray*" in 7 records. "God*" appeared with child* only 90 times, or about 6 per 10,000 records on child. "Satan*" appeared in 75 records, and 16 of the 21 records for "priest" and 18 of the 37 records on "clergy" addressed child abuse. A search on "Jesus Christ" (with no "child*") yielded 18 records, many of which referred to the religion of Latter-day Saints of Jesus Christ. There was limited attention to other major faith traditions with "child*": 260 records on "Jew*," 21 on "Islam*" and 24 on "Muslim*," 40 on "Hindu*," and 6 on "Buddhis*." There were almost as many records (194) on "enuresis"-bedwetting-as on "Christian" (110) and "God" combined (90). The rare disorder of "autism" (entered as "autis*") appeared in close to 7,000 records, while "faith" appeared 43 times, or in 2 per 10,000 records on children. The Sociological Abstracts search yielded similarly low numbers. "Child*" yielded closed to 30,000 records, but "child* and religio*" appeared in only 392 or 1.3% of all records on children. When combined with "child*," there were 0 records on "pray*," 5 for "God" (God appeared in a "title" search 25 times but many were for book reviews), and 0 records for "priest" and 17 for "clergy" (11 on clergy and child abuse). "Child*" appeared with "family" in 20,443 records and "school*" in 1,327, but with "church*" in only 55. Few records appeared for major faith traditions: "Christian*" in 31 records, "Islam*" in 29 and "Muslim" in 3, "Jew*" in 113, "Hindu*" in 20, and "Buddhis*" in 6. "Child*" and "aggression" ("aggressi*") appeared in 260 records, child* and "faith" in 2. In sum, researchers in psychology and sociology have given conspicuously little attention to RSD. Here I offer an admittedly brief argument, on empirical and normative grounds, that to neglect RSD is to neglect a central dimension of development. Religion constitutes an important part of many American families. About 40% of Amer- ican families attend weekly services at a house of worship. Fully 64% of Americans claim that religion is "very important" in their lives and another 24% claim it is "fairly important" (Gallup 1996). Religion is important to American parents, 95% of whom have a religious affiliation (Mahoney et al. 2001), and more than 90% would like their children to receive some form of religious education. Also, 34% of parents identified religious factors (e.g., the Bible, their church, their faith) as a major influence on their parenting (Bama 1998). Youth also claim that religion matters to them. In national surveys (Gallup and Bezilla 1992), 42% of American adolescents said they prayed "frequently" and another 32% "occa- sionally"; 39% claimed that their religious beliefs were "very important" to them and 41% claimed they were "fairly important." In national college samples, 85% of students said their religious beliefs were "very" or "fairly important" to them, 34% reported they attend- ed worship services weekly, and 89% said they believed in God. Thus, religion is impor- 215</page><page sequence="4">Review of Religious Research tant to youth and parents, and integral in their lives, to a degree far greater than the socio- logical and psychological study of the topic suggests. Given the central and positive role that religion has in American family life (e.g., Don- ahue &amp; Benson 1995; Mahoney et al. 2001), it might behoove researchers to rectify the imbalance between the place of religion in human development and the attention it receives in social science scholarship. Consequently, one rationale for this special issue is to offer a modest measure of remedy and, we hope, inspire future work on RSD. THE PAPERS IN THIS SPECIAL ISSUE This special issue offers six papers on different aspects of RSD. Earlier drafts of these published works were submitted after an invitation was extended to those scholars who par- ticipated in the inaugural pre-conference. Invitations were also extended to some scholars who did not participate in the pre-conference but whose work offers important insights. These papers were pursued not only for their general quality but for diversity in topic, method- ology, and level of analysis. For example, one paper investigates children's God concepts while another assesses college students' volunteerism; some papers offer in-depth qualita- tive data from small samples whereas others offer structural modeling analyses of quanti- tative data from massive samples; some papers are more conceptual, others firmly empirical. The first paper, by Annette Mahoney, Ken Pargament, Aaron Murray-Swank, and Nic- hole Murray-Swank, offers a conceptual analysis of sanctification in the family, a "psy- chospiritual" construct that refers to how people perceive dimensions of their lives to be spiritual and sacred. Mahoney and her colleagues offer an empirical and conceptual analy- sis of sanctification in different levels of the family system, including the marital and par- ent-child relationships. The paper is marked by a healthy balance of the advantages and risks of sanctification in the family. The paper will promote future scholarship on sanctifi- cation by identifying important questions that this construct generates. I predict that many scholars will soon agree with the authors' claim that sanctification represents "an impor- tant shift for the scientific study of religion" (Mahoney et al, this issue). David Dollahite, in the issue's second paper, offers a richly qualitative paper with ver- batim narratives from fathers who are devout members of the Church of Latter-day Saints and who have a child or children with special needs. The fathers' own words are remark- able-I suspect many readers will be moved and inspired, and perhaps humbled, not only by the fathers' commitment to fathering in challenging circumstances but by the centrali- ty of faith in the fathers' lives. Dollahite is a thoughtful qualitative scholar who lets the fathers speak for themselves and then frames their experiences and attitudes within a Lat- ter-day Saint theology and worldview. Thus, the paper enriches our knowledge of religious and theological rationales of parenting while teaching us about one of the world's fastest growing denominations. The author also offers a rationale for the use of narrative, qualita- tive data in research on religion. I also commend Dollahite for raising an issue that is a vir- tually absent in academic research on RSD: The role of his, the researcher's, own particular religious background and values in his scholarship and interpretation of data. This candor may help scholars understand and perhaps untangle the complex hermeneutics at work in analyzing qualitative, narrative data (on this matter, see Boyatzis 2001b). It may also encour- age other authors to consider how their own religious sensitivities and sensibilities enter into their scholarship. 216</page><page sequence="5">Religious and Spiritual Development: An Introduction Qualitative data from parents are prominent in the third paper, by Chris Boyatzis and Denise Janicki, on parent-child communication about religion. Their work offers data on some basic but hitherto ignored questions: When it comes to religion, what do parents and children talk about? What is the structure of such conversations? A strength of this paper is its collection of both quantitative and qualitative data: Parents completed surveys on many aspects of parent-child communication about religion and, in a more innovative methodology, wrote diary entries of their actual conversations with their children. These complementary data are useful for charting an unexplored topic such as parent-child com- munication about religion. Also, the different methodologies lead to conclusions about this topic that are sometimes consistent and sometimes not. The theoretical goal of the paper is to determine whether parent-child communication about religion is characterized by a uni- lateral parent-to-child transmission or by a more reciprocal and bi-directional process in which children are active and influential in family communication. The results support the bi-directional, reciprocal pattern in which children are vital participants and parents are receptive to children's views. This model contrasts with the unilateral transmission model in which the child is characterized as a religious tabula rasa, a view that researchers have traditionally posited. The paper, like Dollahite's, includes actual verbatim data in the form of diary entries from families. The following two papers in the issue address the role of religion in youths' "positive" development. In the fourth paper, Linda Wagener, James Furrow, Pamela King, Nancy Lef- fert, and Peter Benson assess the relationship between religious involvement and other pos- itive assets in youth development, using data from a massive national sample. This study is valuable in part because of its use of a broad social ecology model that considers many different factors. The authors determined that religious involvement was related to positive outcomes in youths' lives but primarily through the mediation of other developmental assets. These results are important because they speak to the issue of the "uniqueness" of religion in contrast to other secular social supports that function as socializing factors in youths' lives. From the authors' view, their data suggest that the value of religious involvement may be interpreted as giving youth greater access to social and personal resources. In the fifth paper, Elizabeth Ozorak investigates the role of several intriguing religiosi- ty variables in college students' volunteer service. This is a "hot" topic, and scholars and citizens alike should welcome work that might identify factors related to this important behavior. Ozorak's findings reveal that volunteer work was related in complex ways to stu- dents' religiosity. For example, it is not religiosity per se that matters for volunteerism so much as an intrinsic religious motivation and having a caring (but not a powerful) God image. Ozorak describes an interesting typology of prayer styles and argues that volun- teerism is related more to some kinds of prayer styles than others. The author also presents an eloquent rationale for why social science and society should care about the topic of volunteerism. In the final paper, Justin Barrett and Rebekah Richert present a new account, based on their own empirical work, of children's concepts of God. Scholars have long noted the anthropomorphism in children's (and adults') beliefs about God (e.g., Coles 1990; Harms 1944; Freud 1928; Heller 1986). For example, the Greek philosopher Xenophanes assert- ed that the Ethiopians of 2,500 years ago claimed that God was, like the Ethiopians them- selves, "dark-skinned with a flat nose" (Lesher, 1992). A corollary, perhaps, is that children's concepts of God are constrained in foundational way to personified qualities. But Barrett 217</page><page sequence="6">Review of Religious Research and Richert describe clever and careful investigations that refute the position that young children's beliefs about God's are limited only to anthropomorphic features. The authors call for a revised understanding of children's concepts of God, arguing that while some anthropomorphic aspects persist, children's God images possess special qualities that make God truly distinct. This paper offers an important advance in our understanding of God con- cepts. More specifically, the paper contributes to the question of if and how children's (and adults') religious cognition operates under the same constraints as cognition in other non- religious domains. (See Rosengren, Johnson, and Harris 2000 for a superb volume on reli- gious cognition scholarship.) In sum, this volume offers some of the important and interesting work going on in the study of RSD. In addition, we trust that the papers' conceptual richness and actual sugges- tions will inspire future research that will rectify the neglect of RSD by scholars in the social sciences.
