<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Volume 46, Number 1, January 2009 CONTEXTUAL ADAPTATION James Ross T he question is about contextual adapta tion of meaning, a matter of philosophy of language, occasioned here by a disagreement among philosophers of religion about wheth er words, like "knows," "wills," "loves," "commands," "does," used for common at tributes of humans and the divine, and even "exists" as applied to both, mean the same or acquire divergences of meaning from the discourse contexts. I call the first group "'reformers"1 and the other "analogists."2 Analogists think the reformers are anthro pomorphic, contributing to popular naYve imaginings about God as "a person like us,"3 while the reformers think the analogists are grafting Hellenic ideas onto biblical faith.4 That is not a new dispute, of course.5 But there is a separable linguistic facet of it, examined here, that has wider applications to philosophy in general. The outcome for those disputants is that each may need to acknowledge and respond to something of the other's because (i) al though natural language meanings do adapt to contrasting contexts, the linguistic adapta tions are not enough by themselves to estab lish the ontological claim that divine being is only analogous to creaturely being: one has to employ secular metaphysics to underpin an interpretation of the scriptural message (something reformers resist and some exclude entirely). Nevertheless, (ii) the reformers need to acknowledge that to say the words for divine attributes like "knows," "loves," "wills," "acts," "person' and "exists" mean just the same as they do in talk of ordinary objects is at least misleading. For although the verbal definitions may be the same, the truth-conditions and material implications diverge considerably. But consider contextual adaptation of meaning more generally.6 I. CONTEXTUAL ADAPTATION THROUGHOUT DISCOURSE To say there is ubiquitous contextual ad aptation of word meaning (I call it semantic contagion because it is dynamic7) is not a philosophical theory by itself (though its theoretical explanation may be,8 as it was for Aristotle9). Rather, it is to point to an ob servable and orderly linguistic phenomenon. Adaptation of word meaning to context is characteristic and not episodic in discourse, and it is a distinctive feature of natural lan guages in contrast to artificial and purely formal ones.10 Ordinary examples are seela color; seela tree; see/one's point; seelhow tall he is; know/English; know/England; buyla house; buyla place; buyla seat; buyla theory; brilliant/writer; brilliant/book; healthy/dog;</page><page sequence="2">20 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY healthy/diet; contractla cold (concrete); and contractla disease (abstract). Adaptation happens whenever suitable words co-occur, regardless of a speaker's attention or intention. To remark that there is an informal linguistic ontology,11 exhib ited, say, by the active, the progressive, and dispositional senses of "is" differentiated by context in "Joe is sick"-his occurrent condition (nausea) vs. his dispositional state (disease), vs. his excuse for missing work is no more than to report what is observable. Contrasts of larger context modulate the meanings: throwla ball; throwla hint; throwla game (pitcher vs. cheater); throwla glance. Sometimes the modifications of meaning reflect contrasts of mode and manner of be ing, for instance, contrast of dispositions and happenings, of particulars and universals, of properties and things, and of the real and the imaginary.12 Both (i) divergence of lexical meaning that would show up in contextualized definitions (graspla rung; grasp/my point) and (ii) diver gence of meaning-relevant truth-conditions, not always marked by diverging substitutable synonyms, antonyms, etc.(e.g., tie/a knot; tiela shoe; wrapla string; wrapla package; knowl history; know/England; know/French) happen regularly without involving metaphor or non literalness. Of course, metaphor, synecdoche, metonymy, and other figures also happen the same way, by semantic contagion"3-for example, "cheated" in "He cheated his com pany and himself' and "He governed himself and his province." (That's differentiation by contrasting complements: one sense is alio relative, the other reflexive; the one perhaps legal, the other psychological.) In fact, adaptations of all the sorts il lustrated here, along with consequent con trasts among substitutable near synonyms, antonyms, close opposites, and relevant modifiers of meaning show that the mean ing structure of natural language is not like the one-dimensional referential semantics of first order formal logic. For natural lan guages, besides their word-world referential dimension, have word-to-word (expression to-expression) meaning relationships and effects, an internal semantics, analogous to diatonic harmony and voice leading in music. The material implications depend more on the internal semantics than on the references. Besides, there are contextual con trasts between the same words in unbound discourse and in craft-bound contexts, such as "I was robbed," unbound about a bad deal, vs. craftbound about a crime, and "He assaulted me," unbound about an egregious insult as opposed to the legal, producing fear of bodily harm. Avoiding a Mistake Given that we are not dealing with merely adventitious equivocation (bank/verge; bankl building), to suppose that trait-words (loves, knows, decrees) which apply to country, humans, and the divine either have the same sense (the same linguistic meaning and the same truth conditions14) or that one, at least, is metaphorical, symbolic, or otherwise non literal, is a mistake of division. Differences of meaning-relevant truth-conditions do not by themselves mark the nonliteral because meaning differences can often be less than that.15 For instance, "Hit the mark" can be used metaphorically, say of a good argument, but can also be used literally but diversely of a practiced throw, or of an arrow's flight, as well as, differently again, of a person's park ing a car exactly on a designated spot, or of a person's correctly placing a saw on the line for the cut. Of the varied meaning-differences short of the (unreliable) contrast of literal vs. nonlit eral, most lack names; but two named sorts are "denominative analogy" (e.g., healthy/person; healthy/diet-with many varieties based on various sorts of relations, including sign/ signified) and "analogy of proportionality" (causela car crash; causelan epidemic), based</page><page sequence="3">CONTEXTUAL ADAPTATION / 21 on proportional similarity across category differences, particularly differences in the manner or mode by which the predicates are realized.16 Both have many sub-varieties and competent speakers are fluent with them. Not responding to contextual adjustment of word-meaning impairs philosophical analysis by obscuring the fluidity of our notions and invites the assumption that there is a single set of truth conditions for key notions that will express what things (say, knowing, willing, believing) really are (quid res), when there is no such single phenomenon but rather fami lies of them, and the analyses are limited to context-bound conceptual relations. Philoso phers suffer from a quasi-Platonic hangover, looking for single sets of truth conditions for notions like "x caused y" (Mackie), "S believes that p," "S knows that q" (Chisholm), "S chooses to F," "S wills freely to F" (H. Frankfurt), and then trying to fend off counter examples without acknowledging the raucous plurality of analogous cases. So they do not succeed in telling us what such and such is, and only loosely (though they think precisely) what the claims (e.g., "S knows that P") mean. What something, say, "believing," really is, may, and usually does, overflow the meanings of the words, as water does (see below). The same word in the same lexical meaning often recurs with differing meaning-relevant truth conditions (for instance, canceled/appoint ment; canceledl checks; canceledlflights). The contexts license diverse inferences and reliances: "He knows what's on the test;" "She knows what I am thinking." The de re conditions for "the dog knows where its dish is" and "the child knows where its crib is" and "Smith knows where the talent is" differ significantly and would not be reflected in a single analysis of "S knows where F is," unless the analysis itself adapts to context. Further, contextual differentiation of mean ing defeats certain philosophical accounts of meaning (see below)-for instance, D. Davidson's truth-conditional and composi tional"7 view of sentences that treated meta phor and metonymy as variants of usage18 not of meaning, and made no provision for cases like "knows" (above). 2. ENTITATIVE DIFFERENCE: THE DIFFERENCES IN THE WAYS THINGS ARE SAID TO BE "Exists" differentiates with context, but does not provide ontology. Yet its variation does indicate that there is an ontological issue to be decided. We don't mean the same thing by all existence claims as to real, imaginary, fictional, merely constructed, etc., objects, and such differences, even absent adverbs used to mark the differences, are contextually contracted and exhibited in conversational implications and reliances. The DNA of Sher lock Holmes (is there any?) is not determinate the way Caesar's was. Recently, a philosopher proposed to treat all occurrences of "exists" univocally and made marvelous contortions to accommodate talk of fictions and imagi nary, extinct, and nonexistent objects within such a supposition; it was unpersuasive. Be cause there is not a general test of univocality acknowledged by philosophers, one has to go with informal markers of difference, like contrasting substitutable near synonyms, contrasting verbal qualifiers-"really," "fic tionally," etc.-relevant verbal opposites and adverbs, and differences of contextual implications and reliances, including mate rial inferences that indicate conversational competence. There are meaning differences of "there exits" (an event/ a state of affairs/ a property/ a logical system/ a conundrum/ a cause/ a disease/ a habit/ etc.) not marked by modifiers, but accomplished by context, just as contrasts of fiction, imaginary, real, formal, mathematical, ideal, etc., may be too. Adap tive, automatic response to the differences of paraphrase and material implication is part of linguistic competence. Still, even some philosophers who ac knowledge that action and quality words</page><page sequence="4">22 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY like "knows," "chooses," and "causes" adapt, resist saying "exists" adapts contrastively, because they think existence claims can be perspicuously reformulated with existential quantifiers so that all make ontologically par allel commitments-at least all the first-order ones."9 They are, thus, particularly resistant to the classical and medieval views on the mat ter.20 But they need to re-think. Do numbers, proofs, events, songs, and flocks exist in the same sense as daffodils? Do properties, uni versals, facts, propositions, states of affairs, worlds, and words all exist in the same sense? Aren't there modes of real existence too (con tingently, necessarily, etc.), as well as other modes of existing like fictional, imaginary, constructed, etc.?21 Furthermore, aren't there entia rationis as well as entia realia, that is, things that exist as active thought (judgments, images, memories, constructs, etc.) and some, not without being thought of (social constructs), and some, only while and on account of being thought of? Even temples, shopping centers, intersections, concerts, and money are entities that as to what they are, are mind-dependent (products of human thought), and so, different from independent things like bacteria and viruses. Effortlessly and automatically with differ ent conversational implications and expecta tions, we automatically process the meaning differences of "there is" (exists) in "there is a number larger than eleven; there is one witch that Hob does not believe lives in Oxford; there is a number, N, of the natural numbers; there is an exit a mile down on that freeway; there is a bird in your tree; there is a natural class broader than genera; there are three witches in the first act; there is a force besides gravity in atoms; there is a corporation that makes cars." Although one can write the state ments out with a logical schema from first order quantification, it is a harmful fiction that imagines the notation replaces the meaning of the English. Instead, the notation gets cap tured and differentiated by the English even when philosophers don't notice it. Using the symbols is just perspicuous shorthand for the ordinary English language expressions. The quantifiers either acquire modes like "really," "fictionally," "mathematically," "imagina tively," or the like, from the context, or the "translations" are just bad replacements. For the inferences licensed by the claims depend on the modalities of "exist," just as practices for such talk, differ with the cases.22 I suggest that the contrasts reflect the contrasting status (the informal ontology) implicitly ascribed to things referred to (some are abstractions, some individual physical objects, events, properties, constructs, etc.). If the differing material implications are preserved, the "quantifiers" adapt to context. If not, the translations fail. Just as differences of sort of existence, real, fictional, imaginary, formal, physical, immaterial, etc., are sometimes linguistically marked by adverbs and adjectives, so differ ences of mode (manner) are also sometimes marked adverbially (contingently/necessarily, per selper accidens, substantially/acciden tally, finitely/infinitely). But such modifica tions can be implicit, exhibited merely by the paraphrases, oppositions, qualifications, and inferences that would show up in competent discourse. That's what I call diverging ac cording to contrasts of informal linguistic ontology. It is informal because it is not a theoretical or explanatory scheme but only a suppositional and perhaps socially con structed one. What about the objection that those differ entiations of "there are" are not differences of word meaning, but of sentence meaning entirely from the diverse usage of the words? Some people say such differences belong not to "there is," but entirely to the differing completion expressions like "a number," "an exit," "a force," etc., so that "exists" and "there is" are just neutral and univocal. That might be so if the quantifier were understood as merely reading "for some x . . . " (only in</page><page sequence="5">contrast to "for any x"), without any reality commitment at all, so that one would need another operator (or mistakenly, a special predicate) to express a particular ontological commitment, say "really exist," "fictionally exist," etc. For the neutral fonnulation would not express "there are" but only the contrast of "some" and "any," with no existential commitment at all. Such shorthand would not express the English. So it seems decisive that the quantifier adapts to the category of the subjects and their contexts of utterance. For, we do make a variety of reality com mitments with claims of the form "there are (such and such), e.g., people, mistakes, genera, corporations, physical forces, dis eases, accidents, events, facts, numbers, and designs." Many writers say there are physical objects, facts, states of affairs, propositions, causes, conditions, and catastrophes, for all of which they'd use quantificational formulae as well; yet they can't, if they reflect, mean they all stand alike like telephone poles to be counted univocally in a row. So "exists" and "there are" have to take their coloration from the linguistic contexts23 of the things whose being is asserted.24 "Exists" turns the color of its context; but that goes only as far as a contrast is linguistic and does not settle the metaphysical matter as to how the contrast is grounded or to be explained. Aristotle reasoned that substances (ani mals), qualities (red and square), quanti ties (quarts and gallons), places (fields and streets), and events/actions (concerts and ges tures) do not, any of them, exist ("there are") in the same sense and the same way as any of the others. He also thought all the latter were (variously) said to be, to exist, derivatively (pros hen) from primary substances (things that exist by themselves, like animals and plants and elements). He thought the concep tual relations tracked the real relations among the things and that word-meanings tracked the conceptual. Aquinas extended that idea to say created things exist as things "having being" CONTEXTUAL ADAPTATION / 23 (habens esse), that is, they exist receptively the way the atmosphere shines with light from the sun (Summa Theologiae, I, q. 8, a. Ic) and a mirror shines with lamplight (lamplshine vs. mirror/shine). For, he reasoned, God alone exists per se, ipsum esse subsistens, as the sun is alight by itself and lights the luminous air. Thus, they offered metaphysical ground ing for (some of) the linguistic phenomena. That is something additional to merely taking account of the meaning adaptations involved in the notions we are analyzing for other explanatory purposes like epistemology or moral philosophy. 3. QUALITATIVE DIFFERENCES The adaptations of "exists" to contrasting manners of being, the entitative adaptations, differ from contextual qualitative adapta tions of nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and other qualifiers. Some of those are lexically marked (e.g., droppedla stone; droppedla course; droppedla stitch) in that one would give different definitions and use different co-applicable near synonyms or opposites in the context. For instance, the differences of stopla car, stoplan argument, stopla leak are lexically reflected by differences of co applicable near-synonyms or contraries: e.g., "interrupt" applies to the second and not the first, and "brake" is a near synonym of the first and not co-applicable in the leak case. Other qualitative contrasts are of meaning-relevant truth-conditions, usually not lexically marked in English, e.g., learned writer; learned book; brilliant people; brilliant plan; healthy boy; healthy diet, where the distinction is of cause/ effect, or sign/signified, symptom/condition, etc., that is, by relational diversity, not a dif ference of what is attributed, but of what man ner or in what way related or realized.25 In other languages, say, conjugated and declined ones, and in some dialects such differences may be lexically marked (e.g., as paronymy or syntactically26). Adaptation of meaning in one language or dialect may be paronymy</page><page sequence="6">24 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY or even diversity of words in another;27 for instance, "dare" differentiates in Italian to have many meanings marked by different words in English. The difference of opposed truth conditions between "My computer knows when I mis spell words" and "My daughter knows when I misspell words" is not lexically marked as a difference, say, of synonyms and contraries, but is one of truth-conditions and conversa tional implications. The same holds of "God knows my every thought" and "Lovers know one another's thoughts." They differ in mate rial inferences: the first excludes "finds out" and "guesses" and "but not all of them," while the second allows all three. So what is meant by "know" differs, a difference contracted from the sentential context and exhibited in the conversational pragmatics. 4. SOME CONSEQUENCES FOR TRUTH-CONDITIONAL ANALYSIS, SENTENTIAL COMPOSITIONALITY, AND PHILOSOPHY GENERALLY You can't with assurance find out by truth conditional analysis what something really is (something not being stipulated or invented), say what knowing, loving, or acting willingly really is, any more than you can find out by analysis of meaning what gold or water re ally is. For the former, like the latter, may have overflow de re necessary conditions that are not contained in the meanings, perhaps ones that depend on the physical or genetic features of things accessible only through the sciences. What the item is may not be presented in the conception, just as what heat is, is not presented in the ordinary conception. That, in fact, turns out to be true for everything that is physically realized, whether it is water or even awareness. So conceptual analysis mainly functions for precise conceptual alignment and intellectual bookkeeping and sometimes for expression of novel or deep insight. Conceptual analysis may disclose the implicit linguistic ontology and some of the conceptual interconnections of the words in the contexts under examination, but not the overflow truth conditions that science (or metaphysics or philosophy ) may discover and that may be what, or part of what, the thing really is (just as the truth-conditional analysis of "s is a corporation" will not dis close the full legal conditions for such a thing in an arbitrary jurisdiction, e.g., the registra tion, tax, stock, and officer requirements). It is an unestablished assumption of analysis that things like knowing, acting, willing, and so on are nothing more than the concepts contain. How would we show that? And it surely could not be true if overflow material conditions, e.g., neural-chemical states, are de re conditions for them. There are overflow truth conditions for expressions that denote real things28 and their dispositions, powers, or processes, conditions that are not reflected in the linguistic rela tions, either because they are unknown or because they are not relevant to the discourse of ordinary speakers, the way the chemical composition of baking soda (NaHC03) or the atomic weight of iron are among their overflow truth-conditions but not part of the ordinary meaning. Generally, ordinary mean ings contain what is relevant to unspecialized discourse and action, while the more refined or specialized meanings belong to craft bound discourse (like law, music, medicine, chemistry, diamond cutting, or computer design). That's why, despite the advance in clarity and precision that analysis of com plete sentential contexts had over merely defining single words out of context, it does not achieve what its proponents originally intended, a kind of sentential essentialism. It does not tell us what things really are and may not even tell us much about what is meant over the broad domain of adaptive usage. Truth-conditional analyses (e.g., of "S knows that P" or "S believes that P") have</page><page sequence="7">to suppose that we narrowly restrict the con texts of substitution and of substitution of the conditions as well (for believing is not just one sort of thing, nor is being justified or war ranted). For "knowing that-p" is not univocal over "knowing that John loves her," "knowing that he's exhausted his options," "knowing that there is a number of the natural numbers," and "knowing that he himself exists." Not only are the overflow conditions different, the elements of the analysis, like "believes," adapt (for a person who never thought of it knows he exists, but not so about the number of the natural numbers). So such analyses can be only archetypes or paradigm schemes and not true stories as to what "knowing that-p" really is, since it is not just one thing. Furthermore, contextual adaptation of word meaning falsifies compositional ac counts of sentence meaning where the mean ing of a sentence is thought to be built up from independent units of word meaning like molecules built from atoms (cf. D. Davidson and many similar accounts of the semantics of natural language) because word mean ings are dependent functions of sentence meaning, not just the reverse. That is, word meaning is typically modified by sentence meaning (via the dominance of completion expressions29), and the identities of the sen tence parts are made determinate by their reciprocal adjustments to make a syntactic whole for use in some definite context of thought or action. Words in sentences are more like people sharing a narrow bench, or trees in a windbreak, than like bricks in a wall. They accommodate one another. Indeed, semantic contagion is a distinctive mark of natural languages, in contrast to the rigidity of formal ones and of formal calculi. For the flexibility and polymorphous meaning of a natural language is what makes it into a general purpose meaning system, whereas in a formal language (as usually understood), an expression can only recur in a different sense, or with different truth-conditions, if it CONTEXTUAL ADAPTATION / 25 is explicitly or otherwise definitely redefined. Otherwise, the formal transformations could not be relied upon.30 In natural languages, expressive power is directly proportional to the protean recurrence of words (by seman tic contagion) and not just to the numerical variety of vocabulary. Although English has upwards of a million words (the Oxford English Dictionary has 600,000), most people have practical command of less than 20,000, which are used adaptively for their far more various thoughts and communications. Taking any active verb in English, say, "wrote," "cut," "hit," "drove," and "rode," one can construct multiples of ordinary sentences in which the word recurs in meanings both different from and related to one another, and where not all their differentiated cases are metaphorical or otherwise nonliteral.31 More over, the more differentiating cases one con structs, the more one can construct because polymorphic meaning proliferates itself. So speakers extended words for cognition (knows, believes, thinks, remembers, etc.) from discourse about humans and animals to computers, societies, corporations ("the Electric Company knows how much power you are using"), governments ("Uncle Sam wants you"), and even electronic and other systems ("The lock recognizes the person"). The truth-conditions do not antecedently determine sentence meaning, but result from it (as the difference of "Lions exist and do dos do not" from "Lions and dodos exist and centaurs do not" exhibits). That's why "knows," "believes," "'causes,"' "chooses,," "decides"-and every other expression of interest to philosophers-has so many senses, and why truth-conditional rigidity is so barren and prone to counterexamples. It won't help much to analyze "S knows that p" as imply ing "S believes that p" if it is indeterminate which of the many modes of believing are relevant-for what is believing, anyway? Aren't the varieties of knowing affected by the varieties of believing? Are we going to</page><page sequence="8">26 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY answer whether cats and crows have beliefs by making merely persuasive definitions to order, as do some of the investigators of rationality in other animals?32 Isn't "being justified or warranted" not one thing, but a family? Verbs have variously completable sentence frames, like "They ran a race/a course/a test /a contest/a corporation/a city," where the words that complete the sentence dominate, along with a larger context/action (of which I provide only part) to determine the common words (the frame verb) to diverse meanings, e.g., "He caused a crisis/a crash/the fever." The language accomplishes diversity without any specific intention of the speakers (and even if they intend the opposite). If you say "I was forced into the store by the thugs," "forced" automatically means something different from "I was forced by the traffic to pass on the inside" and from "There weren't any blues in the cupboard, so I was forced to choose red napkins" (assuming ordinary larger contexts), even if you do not notice it, the first involving coercion and the others lesser restrictions of choice. That's like the differences of contextual implications when we attribute belief and intention to animals, governments, corporations, and crowds, in contrast with named, individual people. 5. CONCLUSION The linguistic phenomena sketched above are of general philosophical significance. Applied particularly, they affect the dis agreement of the reformers and analogists, mentioned at the outset. The analogists would, however, be mistaken to think that semantic contagion (that produces analogy of meaning), suggestive as it is, would establish their signature claim of a real, derivative, analogy of creaturely being to divine be ing. They'd need to persuade the reform ers about metaphysics, and convince some reformers who object in principle to the use of Hellenic philosophy at all to understand the scriptural message.33 ( One cannot avoid questions of how metaphysical views affect the understanding of scripture if one makes claims based on scripture that raise direct metaphysical questions, like whether God (or even Jesus) is a person just like us, exists and acts in time or changes (or does not).34 Overall, the contextual adaptation of word meaning undercuts simple truth-conditional accounts of meaning that are supposed to tell us what things (knowing, believing, caus ing, choosing, etc.) really are, conflicts with compositional accounts of sentence meaning, and shows that even formal operators used in nonformal contexts get captured by the con texts as did "exists" above, and as "=" does when used to mean "is the same in number as"9 vs. "is the same thing as" (and in other senses too35). The linguistic phenomena do invite an explanation that goes beyond the se mantic structure of natural languages because the linguistic features at least seem to reflect differences in things. Alertness to semantic contagion may enlarge analytic invention. University of Pennsylvania NOTES 1. Some philosophers, like A. Plantinga, W. Alston, K. Clark, and N. Wolterstoff, who reason that belief in God can be properly basic and not dependent on some evidential foundation, have been called reformed epistemologists. Some at least are influenced by the Reformation tradition of sola scriptura as rule of faith, though they employ secular philosophy in auxiliary exposition of the rationality of religious belief, but do not favor classical metaphysics, as analogists use and adapt it, and secular science for understanding sacred texts and as a defeasible negative test of the sense of scripture.

Analogists think common predicates do not apply univocally to God and creatures and on metaphysi cal grounds, traceable to Plato and Aristotle, think divine being (esse) is only analogous, by priority, to that of anything else. Aquinas is the best-known medieval proponent, along with his interpreter Cajetan, whose position was rejected by Scotus, Ockham, and Suarez, who thought there is a univocal notion of "being." Twentieth-century writers, with disagreements among themselves, like Gilson, Maritain, and Bochenski, continued the "analogy of being" view, along with recent expositors like R. Mclnerny, D. Burrell, B. Davies, G. Klima, and many others. 3. Brian Davies, "Letter from America," New Blackfriars, vol. 84 (2003), pp. 371-384, suggested that many analytic philosophers of religion have drifted into so literalist a reading of the divine attributes as to have fallen outside the traditional Christian understanding of them and into anthropomorphism, or at least into so narrow an understanding that the transcendent mystery of God is obscured. That is the subject of an anthology, Whose God? Which Tradition? (Aldershot, U.K., 2008), edited by the late D. Z. Phillips. 4. See N. Wolterstorff, "God Everlasting," in God and the Good, ed. C. Orlebeke and L. Smedes (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1975), p. 183. Also, see "Unqualified Divine Temporality," in Four Views of God and Time, ed. Gregory Ganselle (Downers Grove, 111.: InterVarsity Press, 2001), pp. 187-213, with a reply by Paul Helms at pp. 214-218. 5. For instance, Luther criticized the scholastics for having fallen under the influence of the pagan Aristotle, and thus misreading scripture. 6. Of course, if reformers and analogists were to agree that words do adjust to the implicit and informal linguistic ontology of their contexts, they could focus more sharply on (i) whether the meanings and import of words in scripture and Creeds are settled by analog?a fidei alone (in tradition with Luther and Barth) or affected by secular sciences as well (in alignment with the scholastics), and to what extent? And (ii) they could address their differences about whether philosophy and secular sciences can be a negative test (defeasibly) for what scripture and religious doctrine propose for belief. Cf. Aquinas, Summa Theologiae, la. q.68, "since Holy Scripture can be explained in a multiplicity of senses, one should hold to a particular explanation only in such measure as to abandon it, if it be proved with certainty to be false." Elsewhere he said, "What is repugnant both to reason and common sense is not contained there." In la. 68, 3c we find, "As, however, this theory [everything is made from water] can be shown to be false by solid reasons, it cannot be held to be the sense of Holy Scripture." 7. See J. Ross, "Semantic Contagion," Frames Fields and Contrasts, eds. A. Lehrer and E. Kittay (Hillsdale, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1992), pp. 143-70, and Portraying Analogy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981). 8. A linguistic explanation is offered in Ross 1981, but not a metaphysical/psychological underpinning as Aristotle and Aquinas supplied. 9. Aristotle provided an implicit grounding of analogous meaning in his metaphysics and abstractive psychology of knowledge. Aquinas followed Aristotle's view that the order/structure of our language follows that of our thought, and that of our thought is derived from that of reality. Thus, analogy of meaning is grounded in analogous reality via analogous thinking that tracks analogy of being (entis) (cf. Ross, "Analogy in Theology" in Encyclopedia of Philosophy, vol. 1 [2006], pp. 138-44). Nowadays, one still needs some theory to explain the relationship of words to the world, to explain reference as well as signification, and to explain what truth-conditions de re are. 10. In purely formal languages, no expression can recur in a different sense without an explicit redefini tion; otherwise, the transformations would be unreliable. However, that does not exclude our perhaps devising a formal system that has at least limited (as opposed to potentially infinite) adaptation as a feature, to model semantic contagion. See G. Klima, "Aquinas' Theory of the Copula and the Anal</page><page sequence="10">28 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY ogy of Being," Logical Analysis and History of Philosophy, vol. 5 (Paderborn, Germany: Ferdinand Sch?ningh, 2002), pp. 159-76. 11. Of course, if Aristotle and Aquinas were right that thought tracks the structure of the world, then informal linguistic ontology might, at least roughly, reflect some of the real ontology. Aristotle employed his key explanatory notions, form/matter, act/potency, cause/effect, and substance/accident, adaptively to context, and Aquinas did the same, even in his analyses of sacraments and other theological subjects. 12. Since analogy in one language may be paronomy or even entirely different words in another (see note 13), adaptive meaning differences may signal real analogy, but do not assure it. The grounding of real analogy (analog?a entis), especially among existents (like numbers, particulars, species, and the divine), is, as many metaphysicians claim, in the nature of things, independently of discourse (though perhaps displayed by it), just as the analogical similarity of the causally interrelated electrical, chemi cal, thermal and mechanical properties of solids is fully grounded in nature, not just in thought. (See J. Ross, Thought and World [Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 2008], chap. 5, pp. 101-3.) 13. Contextual differentiation seems to have a common structure in various Indo-European languages, where pliant expressions are determined by dominant ones (Ross 1981 and 1992), and where analogy of same words in one language (sanus, Lat.) may be paronymy (different grammatical form of same root) in another (healthy/healthful). 14. "Truth conditions" here concerns "meaning-relevant truth conditions," since there is a body of overflow truth-conditions too, say, concerning the chemical and atomic constitutions of things, that are naturally required, but are not semantically included: e.g., you can't have emeralds without beryl, but in ordinary parlance "emeralds are rare green gem stones" does not materially imply "they are aluminum beryllium silicate." 15. It would be a mistake to think "being literal" is a single thing; that would be like trying to give a single truth-conditional analysis of "it's ironic that." But rough and ready estimates will do for now. For the real issue is whether meaning is refined by context. 16. Aquinas, Summa Theologiae, la. q. 13, called that sameness of res significata and difference of modus significandi, where a common definition would fit (e.g., "They both know it."), but the manner of its satisfaction differs fundamentally, say, the difference of knowing why from only knowing that, or of knowing by nature vs. finding out. 17. The view that sentence meaning is made of up of independent word meanings syntactically orga nized into a unit, like bricks into a patterned walkway. 18. "Metaphors mean what the words, in their most literal interpretation mean, and nothing more," according to D. Davidson's "What Metaphors Mean," in On Metaphor, ed. Sheldon Sacks (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978), p. 30. 19. Unfortunately, Quine's "On What There Is" (originally in the Review of Metaphysics [1948], reprinted in From a Logical Point of View [New York: Harper and Row, 1953], pp. 1-19), fosters that illusion, though if read in light of his other writings, it may stand for the idea that one should commit to one fundamental, univocal, domain of existents (whether physical particles or Platonic forms or something else) and define everything else reductively in terms of that one. That would still conflict with the view that not everything which exists is reductively analyzable into one domain of univocal existents. 20. But Aristotle definitely thought "being" adapts contrastively to context (e.g., to the various catego ries) as did many scholastic metaphysicians, especially expanding the idea to God and the world under neo-Platonic influence (and Plato, too, thought things that participate in the Forms are not said to be in the same sense as the Forms); those writers thought God is said to be in a sense different and a way prior to and explanatory of the being of everything else.</page><page sequence="11">CONTEXTUAL ADAPTATION / 29 21. They may even illustrate that by saying that the being of God is related to that of all created things the way that contingently existing things were thought by Plato to be related to the Good, by participa tion. 22. Other languages do the same thing. If I thought for a while about Berkeley today and for a while about Hamlet, it would be misleading to say without qualification, "There are two people he thought about today." 23. A linguistic category itself can be modified contextually so that "a man ran out" in one context can refer to a real human and in a novel to a fictional one. 24. How about "Caesar is dead"? Ordinarily, a thing has to exist to bear a predicate; but in this case a thing has to not-exist or not be alive at some time, to bear the predicate. So the formulation "there is something that is dead" (where we are not talking about an object, like a squirrel carcass that used to be a squirrel) is not univocal with the formulation, "there is something that is alive." That there really are things that are extinct and really are ones that are impossible are differentiated senses of "there really are." Besides, for John to be an athlete, a continuing ability is required, while to be curious can be a continuing readiness, whereas to be alive is a continuing (defeasibly) state and not an individual act. All those contrasts are variously carried over to "is" as read with existential import. So "there is" and "exists" do adapt in context in ways that reflect contrasts in the reality status we pre-theoretically suppose of the subjects. 25. Thus, two same-word sentences can differ in meaning by mode of attribution: "John is rational" (i.e., a rational animal essentially), and "John is rational" by acquisition of thoughtfulness; context will differentiate them. 26. In an African American dialect, the two senses of "He's sick" (nauseated now vs. ill, as a condition) are marked by "He sick" and "He be sick." Cf. William Labov, Language in the Inner City: Studies in Black English Vernacular (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1972). 27. By conjugation and declension or by suffixes, healthy and healthful may translate as one word into other languages. And "healthy" is often used in American indifferently for the two meanings, as in "healthy person" and "healthy food." 28. For instance, the atomic constitution of water and aluminum. 29. See Ross 1981 for semantic dominance and Ross 1992 for semantic relativity. 30. See note 10, above. 31. Note that I have not defined "literal" because it is a contrast-relative notion such that a use that is literal relatively to another that is metaphorical, may itself be nonliteral relatively to a third, to which, like the second, it too is nonliteral. E.g., he parked his car at the curb, he parked himself in my chair, he parked his money in the foreign account. 32. A number of the essays in S. Hurley and M. Nudds, Rational Animals? (Oxford: Oxford Univer sity Press, 2006) use varied, sometimes merely persuasive, conceptions of rationality, that the editors examine in their 85-page survey and analysis of the topic. 33. Some may explain the grounding for such meaning differences, not by Platonist vs. Aristotelian accounts of being, but, like Hartshorne and others, by a Whiteheadian process metaphysics, though Wolterstorff and some others might object to that in principle too, following the sola scriptura principle (that the scriptural text is the only source of faith and of its own interpretation by analog?a fidei). 34. Perhaps we can re-focus the analogists and reformers on a critical examination of the role of philoso phy and secular science in the interpretation of scripture and religious doctrine (see note 5, above).</page><page sequence="12">30 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY 35. "Selves = very angry . . . could be = work of half caste . . . know this = impossible" (Matthew Kneale, The English Passengers [New York: Doubleday, 2000], p. 366), where "=" means "to be" and "is," e.g., "He = dead," and occurs predicatively as in "Entire bag = vanished," and "This = provocation not to be tolerated" (Kneale 2000, p. 368), and as "is the same thing as" (in "= work of half caste") and in other related meanings outside the strictly arithmetical. Even to say "the number after ten = eleven" differs from saying "the number of the natural numbers is = N."</page></plain_text>
