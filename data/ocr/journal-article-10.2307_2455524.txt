If the reviewNler recounts his ad- Aventures with DIr. Bolin 's fisecinatiu hook lie canll perhaps give a better idea of it than in any T other way. Dr. Bohln has for years been engaged in a study of the behavior of the aznimials of the seashore, as influenced by the conditions under which theyT live. His published papers set forth that the behavior of these anialtlis the wvornis, crabs, snails, sea aneniones and the like-is wAionderfully dependeiit on the past influences they have iiuidergoiie; the changes of tides, of dayT and night, anid the like, leave their records onl the aniniaCils, so that after renioval froni these ao'enits, the creatures still show the habits forinied under their influence. Thus the behavior of these creatures is iiot fixed. and final, but surprisinglly iiodifiable. Such complete and overwlhelniing confirmation of the results and views that had been indclep)eiideitly expressed by the present reviewer aiid going even beyond wheat lie had anticipated, could not be received by him otherwNTise than wN~ith entliusiasmi; lie reconiimended the Awork to his friends audi wArote a laudatory review:2 als Bolin ill the present volume notes with satisfaction, his work "'surprised the Aniericans " (p. 71).

XLIII to reach results seemi-nio to confirm whatever theory the author AwAished to establish. It was, therefore, with special. interest that the reviewer greeted the appearance of a general work by Bohn; on the one hand, it would naturally deal]. AlTith phenomena that the reviewer is convinced are of special importance; on the other, it AwTas hoped that the care and accuracy of presentation would be such as to remove all doubts as to the validity of Boliin's scien tifie results. As to the first point, a general examination seemed to show onee's best hopes gratified. The, book might be called aIn amipli- fication of the text "Tlhe reactions of a living creature at a given moment depend not only on the present conditions, but on all the conditions of the past life not onlv the life of the individual under consideration, but also that of its ancestors" (p. 259) .4 This is the spirit in which I have desired to see written a book on behavior. The book is not put in the form of a connected account , but is rather a series of discussions of general topics and problems, illustrated by examples. Discussion of the work and views of other investigators occupies a large space; here the author paints in large, swTeeping strokes, pronouncing as to good or ill with absolute confidence. This method makes lively reading, but it requires great audi accurate knowledge of details and a most fair and judicious spirit to use it and remain scientific; wiithout these qualities it is cheap, easy and misleading. The author's qualifications in these respects we shall inquire into later. Many of the author 's general principles and methods seem excellent; he attempts to distinguish the varied different factors in behavior; to establish definite mneanings for terms long ummider doubt or controversy (so for example the term tropism); to search for objective factors everywhere; he recogimizes fully the complexity and modifiability of behavior. The reviewer fimids especially sympathetic the section oni the uselessimess of the idea of instinct as an analytic concept; the emphasis on the fact that all adaptation or "finality" is a problem, not a solution (p. 286); the idea of the "struggle against variation" (Ch. 15), I This sentence is used by Bohn as a summing up of ideas expressed by Semon; it seems to me however to express the idea of this hook, though here Bohn possibly might not agree.</page><page sequence="3">No. 514] NOTEs AND LITERATURLE 621 and indeed. many other matters. Eveii. where he would disagree, the discussion is interesting and. ofteii valuable. Little reading of the book is necessary to showv-, what has been evident from recent papers, that the author is a hero worshipper, and that at present the hero of his tale is (most deservedly in a book onl the objective study of behavior) Jacques Loeb. Yerkes is given a place as a wiorthy followiver of the master, while the present reviewer takes the rdle of the villain in the plot. It will be worth Nwhile to translate Bohn 's characterization of three American investigators, as givinag aii example of his style of thought and expression. I quote froni aii article ill the Redvue Scicnhtifique of -May 16, 1908, which gives sonie picturesque fea- tures not taken into the book. I lhave pronounced the name of Galileo; I can not resist the tempta- tion to inscribe by the side of this name that of the biologist JACQUES LOEB. Certainly since Galileo times lhav\e changed. No long-er are revola- tionary savants persecuted, at least not openly. There are free coIm- tries such as America for inen such as Jacques Loeh. Beyond the Rocky Mountains, on the shores of the most beautiful bay in the world, at Berkeley, opposite San Francisco, are the laboratories whither the Californians havTe called the great biologist; it is in a scene truly fairy-like that Loeb works without easing aiid whence lie seuds forth the ideas which pass through the world to give a significance to biological researches.5 However, in America they continued to gather facts. And a savanit of great worth, YExzES, completed without noise the work of Loeb6 by searching out, within a spirit of method truly remarkable, lhow lasso- ciationis are formed in animals; his two memoirs on the acquisition of labits in the frog and the crayfish will remain classic and mIulISt serve as models to all those who attack thie same questions. Yerkes has slhow-\Tn a quality that is rare among psychologists; that of olot attemptinl to choose a personal attitude aiid to attach his name to a system; lie has endeavored constantly to establish f acts with all the rigor desirable and to give to tlueni wise interpretations.

It re- mained entire. The hurricane which had made such rava-ges ini Ame-rica made' itself felt even in Europe, where it had little trouble to demolish the frail constructions of M. Nuel.S The part sketched for the third actor in the plot is certainly an unworthy one, blt there is after all something dramatic about figuring one 's self, after Bohn, as a sort of demon that rides upon the storm, carrying trouble to the poor creatures of earth; so this, with the pleasure of seeing the ideas of the complexity and modifiability of behavior in lower organisms for which I have long worked, so completely triumphant in Bohin 's book, must perforce be my consolation. It is the traditional fate of innovators to suffer condemnation that their work mlay prevail. But there remains the second point to coimsicler; iii the book the author Oives us a study not only of phenomena at the sea- shore, which we can not test for ourselves, but of the work amid views of other investigators, which we can, ourselves examine. Here is a test for the accuracy, thoroughness and consciemitious- ness of his work, for his mental grasp and his freedommi from prejudice a. test for which we have above mentioned the mneecd. Does lie stand this test in a way to set at rest the doubts that have been expressed as to the trustworthiness of his scientific results in difficult fields? For this test I naturally examined his presentation of my owA work, since that is the matter with which I am best acquainted; furthermore I wi-as of course curious to see why he presents nie as one of the pow-ers of darkness, while I have welcomed him as a support and ally.

A citation of some typical examples will enable the reader to formi an idea of the author 's practise and ideals of accuracy. Any one acquainted with my work on the reactions of lower organisms will recall that I found and set forth, with what seemed to many wearisome repetition, that the cause of reaction is in a large proportion of cases a change in external conditions, variation in concentration of chemicals, in degree of tempera- ture, intensity of illumination, etc. NowN, Bohn has likewise observed this (as had many previous workers), and he makes large use of it in explaining behavior, under the name of sensibilitye" differentielle'' it forms one of his three main factors in behavior.

"I1 s'agit, en effet, cle reponses a des variations plans on noims brusciues des diverses forces di inilieu exterieur'" (p. 167). Consider in connection with the above statements from Bohn, the following: In the table of contents of iy book on the "Be- havior of the Lower Organisms" (1906), we find the caption Change of Conditions as a Cause of Reaction. Turning to the indicated chapter (XVII), as any one would naturally do who desired to form a conception of my results on this matter, we finch that the second numbered paragraph begins: The most general cause of a reaction is a change in the conditions affecting the organism. This has been illustrated in detail in the de- scriptive portions of the present work (p. 293). Practically the entire chapter is taken -up with aii analysis and discussion of variations in the eiivironinental ageiits as causes of reaction. In the descriptive portions of the work the point is set forth mnost explicitly again and agaiii. Taking the account of Paraniecium as a type, we find the followingq: It is clear that the cause of reaction is the change from one solution or temperature to another (p. 51). The animal, having' been subjected to certain conditions, becomes now subjected to others, and it is thre brrtnSitionD from one stote to another that is thte cause of reaction. This is a fact of fundamental sigonificance for understanding' the behavior of lower organisms'2 (p. 52). But as its mnovenments carry the animal from one region to another, the environmental conditions affecting, it are of course ehanoled, amd some of these changes in condition act as stimuli, causing the animal to change its movements (p. 5S). In the reactions to ineelamnie al stimuli, chemicals, osmotic pr'essui'e, heat and coli, and powrcfol li-lit, the avoiding reaction is caused by the transi- tion from one external condition to another, by change in. the intensity of action. of some agent (p. 78). Examination has shown us that the cause for this reaction is some change in the conditions (p. 10S). For other orglanismns the point is likewise developed in detail ancd stated with equal explicitness. Thins, for Aniceba: " The cause of a reaction that is, of a change in movenent-is in iost eases some change in the environment' (p. 19) for Bac- teria: "'The reaction is caused as a rule by a change in the environment of the organism" (p. 37) for time reactions of Stentor to light: "'all together, then, our experlments have 12 The italics are in the original.</page><page sequence="7">No. 514] NOTES AND LITERATURE 625 thus far shown that the cause of the avoiding reaction is the change from darkness to light" (p. 131) ; for Euglena: "It is clear that the reaction is due to the decrease in the intensity of light" (p. 136) ; for reactions of infusoria in general to chem- icals: "The reaction is in each case caused by a change from one concentration to another'' (p. 123) ; for their reactions to light: "To smin up, we find that the reactions to light occur in the infnsoria in essentially the same way as do the reactions to most other stimuli. . . . The cause of reaction is a change in the intensity of light" (p. 149). Pages cold be filled with quotations from my book to the same effect. In my earlier papers the matter is dealt with ini an equally full anmd explicit way. MIy paper on "'Reactions to Light in Ciliates ancl Flagellates13 is mainly devoted to showing in detail that the reactions are dne to variations in the intensity of light. A section headed "Natture of Agent causing the Reaction" be- giis' "The primary anud essential cause of reaction is a change of illumination'' (p. 65). My paper on "The Behavior of Para- meciumn'" has a section headed Natnre of Stin-iul ation, iii which we find the following: Au examiuatiou of the facts showTs that as a general rule the effective stimuli consist of some change in the eoudcitions (p. 464). These quotations are iiot isolated; they are mnere typical sen- tences in an extended elaboration of the point set forth, and they could be multiplied almost indefinitely. How then Bohn could make the statement that I had not taken account of this matter is inexplicable. But assuring that I was unacquainted with the fact that forms in reality the foundation of my presesitation of the causes of reaction, the author of course cannot possibly understand my account of behavior; it is to hini necessarily an edifice without foundations and must therefore crumble to earth. This is the source from wirhich all of his inisconceptions and (unintentional) misrepre- sentations of niy wiork flow as naturally as water from a spring.

I-le is led to suppose that my account, being wrong in prin- ciple, must also be wrong in details, so that he attempts to cor- rect details, by giving usually the sanie explanation that I had already given; or at tinies sonie other causal explanation that he devises, without experiment, to account for the facts; this often leads him into curious errors. 4. He is inevitably driven to suppose that I reject cleterminnismn in behavior. 5. IHe is naturally led (though here without real basis as it seems to me, save by additional error of the same sort) to attrib- ute to me psychic, anthropomorphic and finalistic explanations in place of causal ones. Let us look briefly at certain of these points. 1. My concept "trial and error" the author is forced by, his mistake to suppose designed to take the place of aii experimental analysis based on a real knowledge of the causes of reaction. His account of its origin is: As hle has not taken into account the phenomena of sensibility to differences, lie has been led to speak of trial and error (p. 191.). The fact is that the idea of trial and error was based precisely on reactions due to "sensibility to differences'; to changes in the conditions, and I have again a~nd again stated that fact. For example: Just what is the nature of the stimulation which produces this reac- tion by "trial and error" in Parameecininn ? An examination of the facts shows that as a general rule the effective stimuli consist of some c7hctge in the conditions." The purpose of the concept was to bring under a uunified point of view a complex of stimulations and reactions which had the interesting and important result of bringing the orgaiiisnic into conditions adapted to it, yet not including "anything differing in essential principle from such methods of action as we find in the inorganic world.' ' The concept is useful only in at- tacking the problem of how adaptation is brought about without the operation of "final causes." To speak of "trial and error" of course does not get rid of the necessity of finding a deter- mining cause for every phase of the reaction, any more than to call a reaction "tropism" has this result. It has been pre- I) The Behavior of Paramiecium,' Joion. Comp.

''17 The application of the phrase "trial and error" to lower organismss arose as follows: The organisms react to changes in the conditions by movements of a peculiar char- acter, which subject them to various environmental changes. Some of these changes cause them to react further, still further chan g ing - the conditions. Finally, as a rule, their continued movements bring them into conditions which do not cause them to react by further movements; since they do not react further they remain in these conditions. There is, as I have repeatedly attempted to show, evident experimental cause for every detail of this behavior. W\Te do not need any purpose or idea in the mind of the oroanisn, or any " psvChoid " or enteleehy, to account for the chane, of be- havior, for a1n adequate objective cause exists."8 But we need a name for such behavior; we need as it were to throw a net about it, gatherimig it together, so as to grasp its essential points, to the exclusion of inessential details. I have often characterized it as the selection of certain environmental conditions as a result of varied movements. For a briefer phrase, I found in connuon use for behavior in higher animals that is objectively similar, the expression "'trial and error,'" so I employed this, specifying with the greatest care that it was only the similarity in oi)jective features that I desired to bring ,lit.,9 Later developments have shown that the designation was an mlfortnuate one, since readers not accustomed to cdistingush- ing the phenomena on wThich a colncept is based from other things that may be intermingled wJTith it iln particular cases are inclined to read into it in every case all that may occur in con- nection with it in any case; this seems to be Bohn 's method of procedure. Other authors have foumd no difficulty in grasping the point involved; so Driesch in his recent volumes on the "Science and Philosophy of the Organism"; and Pillsbury in his paper on "'Trial and Error as a Factor in Evolution, "'O 1 Ibid., p. 343.

XLIII where the concept is applied, in precisely the significanee I gave it, to inanimate things. Objection to the phrase as liable to lead to niisunderstancling among the inueritical I am glad to recognize as justified, so that I no longer employ it, but Bohn merely ranges himself Calnong the uneritieal.21 Bohn's inattention to my statements as to the eause of reaction of course leads him to suppose that whenever I speak of trial and error I iiiean that there is no experimental cause for the reactions; hence if he can show that there is experimental ease, this does awiay with the eoneept of trial and error! He there- fore takes -up a number of cases of reaction described by me (pp. 172-175, 187-195, ete.), shows, as I had done before, that they are due to changes in environmental eonclitions, and con- eludes that my exposition is wrong; that the application of the idea of trial and error is a mistake. His idea of trial and error iS that it involves chance, in the sense of being -undetermined. 1By time analysis that I have macie above, I have been led to reject many of the pretended trials aini to show that the chance was most often only an illusion (p. 979). In whose mind was the illusion? MAly own statement has been: E-veryone, of these m-iovemients is, of course, as absolutely determined as the most orthodox troiS11. Agaimi, Bohnl says: " Inmceed, many of the sinuosities of the path followed by the lower aniimals ean finid an explanation in the conmbination of the tropisms and the phenomena of sensibility to differences"' (p. 279), anmd iii all seriousness he copies some of my figures and instructs me that the reactions showTn are due to changes in the emivironmiental conditions, just as I had shown before him. Some of the facts here are alniost incredible; they throw a stramige light oni the author's accuracy and intelligent grasp. Thus, in the case of one of the figures copied from nei (on p. 188), from which lhe draws on p. 191 the conclusion that I have "not taken into account the sensibility to cdifferenees," 21 It is a remarkable fact that in an earlier review of my book (Bdl. Inst. Gen. Psychologiqae, 1906 (?), p. 282), Bohn understood correctly my usage of this phrase, as well as various other points that he now mis- understands. It would be most interesting to know the internal history of the change by which Bohn has been brought from a position of intelligent comprehension to one of blind misconstruction of my work. It is mani- festly not due to further study of my work, since, as we have seen, he now shows extraordinary lack of acquaintance with the main points I made. 22Jourval of EJxeprimental Zoology, 3, 1906, p. 452.</page><page sequence="11">No. 5141 NOTES AND LITERATURE 629 itn the very ?description of the figure, that I gave, both in my Coitribittioits (p. 55) and my book (p. 139), I stated repeatedly aind dn detail that the cause of the reaction wulas the change in intentsity of the light. I even pointed out on the figure just where this cause carme into operation. I added this in the ex- planation of the figure (though given also in full in the text), in order that no one, however careless, could miss it; but Bohn has succeeded in doing so. In an account of the reactions of a ciliate infusorian that purports to correct liy owin, at the mo- nient when the animal reverses its course the author says: "It is at this moment that I introduce the notion of sensibility to differences'" (p. 193). This introduction having leen made years before23 and the acquaintance having been intimate ever since, the ceremony is hardly wATorthy of the solemnity with which the author invests it. Bohln's inability to catch the idea of "trial and error'" as I presented it is further clue to two other points: (1) To speak merely of selnsibility to differences seems to me quite insufficient for characterizing the reaction; the most important point is wv~hat the orgai'ismnc does. Different organisnls do very different things and the same organism in different conditions reacts differently, under the same stimulus. What the oroalnism does is the matter to which my attention has been primarily directed. Now, in those reactions that I called "'trial and error'" the organismls perform complex movements of such a character that they stubject it to many different ,oonclitions. This was the basiS for the use of the word trial, it meant this and nothillg more. (2) Bohn is content to speak of "'sensibility to differences,'" with- out analyzing the nlatter further. I carried the analysis nluch further, bringillg out, not only the faet that the organismns react to some ellvirollnmelltal changes and Inot to others, but that there is some system in this; that there is a relation between the changes to AA hich the givTen oroganismin reacts, and its oWn internal physiological processes; I tried to show that it reacts as a rule to changes that interfere with its physiological processes, in The change in the solution at this point produces the claracteiistic reflex "'; Jennings, 1900, imer.

It was here that I pointed out especially that for each step "an adequate objective cause exists." These relations, which Bohn neglects, are fundamental both for an understanding of the con- cept under discussion, and for any real understanding of be- havior. 2. The same causes that preven-lt Bobn from unLuderstanidinig what I meant by "trial and error' equally prevent him from unclerstaniding my criticism of the tropism theory. IHe says: Jennings, from lack of leaving made the distinction between tropism anid sensibility to differences, has been led to criticize. ill ani unjust mii-anilner ', the tropisms of Loeb (p. 173). The notion of sensibility to differences has escaped Jennings; this investigator made the mistake of confounding it wvith that of tropisms, etc., etc. (p. 179). Nov, my reason for criticizing the application of the theory of tropisms was precisely because I did make the distinction Bohn speaks of. I dealt with a question of fact. The reac- tions of the organisms I studied had been commonly designated tropism (or taxis) and I -used the same term until I had shown clearly wJhat the nature of the reaction was. Then, being in- terested in the facts of behavior, I made an analysis show ing that as a matter of fact the behavior did not consist of tropisms, that the theory of tropisms is not of great service in helping us to ullnderstand the behavior of these lower organisms.' "24 I can readily understand how it might be held that the theory is of service for certain reactions, but it is hardly worth while to attack my presentation on such mistaken ground as that I did not distinguish tropisms from reactions to variations in the environment. I have set forth in full my position on the tropisms in a recent paper,25 so I may pass over it here. There is little in Bohn 's impassioned defense of the tropisms that I could not assent to in principle; though I might object to the application to particular cases, and especially to the views wThich he attributes to me onl the matter. Points with which I could warmly agree are the following: 1Ie wTarns against " the deplorable results into which authors have been led by adopting the view according to which there would be tropisms everywhere'" (p. 241). He says that "'the activity of lower animals is composed of complex elements; 2 The Theory of Tropisms,'" Pub. Carn.

"It is very possible that the nervous system and the sense organs lend their help and facilitate the processes of which the tropisms a.re the consequence'" (p. 124) ; the tropisms are variable (p. 132) they are mixed with all sorts of other activities (p. 132). '"It is often said that the tropisms are irresistible mtiovements, but this applies of course only to the case where the tropisms are of an intensity sufficient to overwvrhelm the animal; to alnnihi- late its other motor manifestations' (p. 132). A similar state- melnt could of course be made for any cause of movement what- ever. Bohn 's definitions of the tropisms seem on the whole such as to connuand assent, though I reserve certain criticisms in de- tail, such as the strange bringing of the will into the definition of a1n objective phenomenon (p. 117, etc.). As to the views attributed to me, Bohn says "'for him the tropisms would be the result of an apprenticeship; of long series of trials'' (p. 137). In this and similar passages the author follows his usual plan of making a positive statement without citation of his basis for it. I am not aware of ever having ex- pressed any such view as is here attributed to me. On the con- trarv, I have said that the method of trial and error ''is in comn- Plete contrast'' with the tropisms 6 while on tAie sae page (anAd elsewhere) I have said that behavior of the stereotyped char- acter of the tropisms occurs also. 3. As remarked above, Bohn assumes that it is necessary to correct my account in detail as well as in principle. His usual method, as we have seen, is to give the same explanation that I had already given. Either a feeling that nothing good could come out of mly work, or his natural habit of mind, has led him in other cases into extreme carelessness of statement. One or two examples must suffice. 0mm page 190 he says, iii discussing my account of reactions to light: There is a factor of -which Jennings has miot taken account, it is the factor of tim'te. A certain time is necessary for orienting itself. Comnpare the following from Jennings: Thus the orientation is gradual and for a certain stretch after the light has begun to act the organism is not completely oriented. With a fairly strong light however, the period of time required for complete orientation is very slight. 21, The Method of Trial and Error,' Publ. Carn. Iast., 16, 1904, p. 50.</page><page sequence="14">632 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. XLIII yA entire analysis, properly understood, will be seen to largely depend on the fact that a certain time is required, and to be devoted to accounting for it. This analysis Bohn has evidently never looked into with care, since, as we have seen, he is not even aware that I attributed the reactions to variations in the intensity of light. It is well to give the devil his due; if one does it with care he may find he is not dealing wiith the devil at all! Among the most remarkable feats of the author along this line is his attempt to recount and explain my description of the behavior of two arncebe, one of which pursued and captured the other. The captor a after engulfing b, returns on its course, carrying the prey b (alt 6, 11, 14 of Fig. 21 in my book; at 4 and 7 of Bolin 's copy of the figure). Bohn says that the re- turning of the captor a is a mere recoil (''recul ''), due to the separating of b from a; in place of b a glass rod wTould do jlust as well. The Alcelba a quits with difficulty the contact \with the solid body which oine moves; w\then one breaks the contact suddenly the mechanical change which resillts from it for Amoeban a determines the recoil of the latter. In the description of the figure the author points out just where the "recoils" occur. Now the facts are, as I took pains to describe in mny account, that this reversal of movement which Bohn calls the recoil (as at Boin's 4, 7) takes place vot when the prey escapes, but after the captor has enclosed it; having captured its prey the captor returns on its course. Bohn 's ex- planation is then quite inadmissible. In copying part of my figure Bohn unfortunately omits precisely the portion that shows the larger amoeba carrying the smaller after reversal of its course (at 6 of my figure). 4 and 5. I have given a sufficient number of illustrations of the author's accuracy and grasp of my work to make it easy to coinceive the value of his accusations of inldeterinijuism, of anthroponmorphisni; of such criticism as "'Jennings has not carried far enLough the analysis of the movements of the lower organisms. (This from a writer who does not so much as know that I attributed reactions to variations in the environ- mental conditions!) 27 C Reactions to Light in Ciliates and Flagellates," PulN. Cainl. Inst., 16, 1904, p. 59.</page><page sequence="15">No. 514] NOTES AND LITERATURE 633 The attributions of incleterminism, anthropomorphism, etc., have their source in his mistaken statement that the idea of reac- tions to variations in environmental conditions had escaped me; in his book he places them on that basis, With the demonstra- tion of his mistake on that point they fall to the ground. Let us put the matter clearly once for all. Either Bohn can or he can not cite passages from my work which justify his assertions anid implications that I deny determinism and that I give an- throponiorphic and non-objective explanations in place of causal ones. He has not as yet made, either in his book or his number- less papers, any attempt to give such citations. If he can do so, it would be worth while, that we may see on what basis lie is proceeding. If he can not, to continue to make such statements is uunscientific, for they are not verifiable. Alas! then, we find that our author does not stand the test that we hoped knight set at rest the doubts as to the accuracy aiid trustworthiness of his scientific results in difficult fields. I have not attempted to test the remainder of his account, but I fear that similar qualities might be fomncd there. Has the author shown, in his account of the work above analyzed, aceu- racy and care of the same kind that lie employs in reporting what happens in the infinitely more difficult field of nature? If not, why not? And if he has How much are his scientific results worth ? From the literary standpoint the book is one that makes interesting reading, and many of the general ideas are worthy of attention. But such confmfsion, inaccuracy and miiisstate- ments of fact as we have pointed out above are almost or quite sufficient to remove it froni the field of science. H. S. JENNINGS.</page></plain_text>
