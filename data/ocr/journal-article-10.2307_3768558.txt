The first person to be approached had been Heinrich Schliemann, who responded enthusiasically to the suggestion that he should excavate Naucratis. The proposal was vetoed at once by Maspero: Schliemann would never do: he was tactless and quarrelsome, sought only publicity for himself and would alienate the authorities.

This area contains the ancient city of Naukratis (modern Kom Ge'if), which, according to the Greek histo- rian Herodotus, was the first and only city in which the early Greek merchants were allowed to settle. The area also contains a number of other sites dating from Pharaonic through later Roman times. Unfortunately, little is known of these sites and their state of preservation. Indeed, the process of decay and modern encroachment has been so serious in the Delta that a resolution was passed at the Second lnternational Congress of Egyptologists held at Grenoble, France, in September 1979, giving top priority to survey work in the Delta. Accordingly, the Naukratis Project has involved: 1) A sur? vey of all ancient sites within an approximate 30 km area to the north and west of Naukratis in order to learn more about the environs of the city. Such a survey has assessed the character of the visible remains, the state of site preservation, and the extent of intrusions made by modern settlements and cultivation (Coulson 1996); 2) a program of excavation at the site of Naukratis based on modern exca? vation techniques and backed by an interdisciplinary support staff. This report of the Ancient Naukratis series is divided into two volumes. The first describes the results of the excavation at the southern end of the ancient city at a mound within the village of Kom Ge'if (Leonard 1997). This, the second fascicle, details the excavations to the northeast of that village in an area known to both Sir William Flinders Petrie and local farmers as Kom Hadid. Excavations were carried out almost simultaneously, and according to the same excavation meth? odology, at both Kom Hadid and Kom Ge'if during the 1982 and 1983 field seasons. This fact accounts for the degree of duplication in the Preface of both Naukratis fascicles since many of the same people and funding agencies were involved in both aspects of the project. The author believes that such duplication is necessary not only for the sake of completeness but also to facilitate use of each volume by the reader. Because the details of the stratigraphy at Naukratis had been debated for almost a century, the strategy of our excavations in the South Mound at Kom Ge'if was to present first the maximum verti? cal exposure of the archaeological soils still extant between the rising ground water and the sebakhin- scarred surface of the ancient site. Then, after we had produced a clear understanding of the historical periods that were still preserved at Naukratis, we would direct our emphasis to the clearing of larger (horizontal) areas in an attempt to elucidate the type(s) of occupation represented by each chronolog- ical/historical phase in the life of the inhabitants of this famous emporium. Excavation was conducted according to a modified "Wheeler-Kenyon" (balk/debris) method of excavation (Dever and Lance 1978; Seger 1971) that was specifically tailored to meet the particular problems of excavation in the Nile Delta. At Naukratis all archaeological excavation was done by the excavation team and volunteers under strict supervision by experienced field and square supervisors. The use of local labor was limited to tasks such as the removal of already-excavated soils, the washing of pottery, and the guarding of excavation areas. Our gafir, Mr. Ahmed Shehab Mousa, the local antiq? uities guard, provided immeasurable help in securing qualified people to help us in this respect. The basis of our recording system is the Locus, defined simply as any three-dimensional entity encountered during the excavation process. Loci can be either artificial (a procedural device more IX</page><page sequence="7">x Preface AASOR 55 commonly termed a probe), or they may be authentic (such as a wall, pit, soil lens, or floor). Occasionally a Locus will carry a "Point P" suffix (Locus XXXX.P), a device that is restricted to arti- factual and ecofactual material found directly on a floor or surface, and is used to call attention to the association of that material to the floor/surface. Also used is a "Point One" suffix (Locus XXXX.l), which is used as a control when collecting the first 10 cm below such occupation surfaces. The basic unit of our excavation system is the "pottery bag," which represents the specific material collected from a precisely recorded, three-dimensional entity and in that regard may be considered to be a mini-Locus (Seger 1971: 16). A pottery bag may be excavated as one Locus and on the basis of subsequent study be reassigned to another Locus, but it always remains intact and cannot be subdivided. Any suspicion of contamination in a pottery bag automatically reassigns it to the latest of the Loci under consideration, or to Topsoil. A typical pottery bag from our excavations might be recorded as "N.III.62.10," which stands for Naukratis, Field III (Kom Hadid), Area/Square 62, Bag 10. This will have been the tenth bag assigned during the excavation in Area 62, and that was assigned (or reassigned) to Locus 6210. Artifacts (pottery, glass, coins) as well as ecofacts (bone, shell, soil samples) are all attached to an individual pottery bag so that if that bag is reassigned during the interpretive phase, all of the mate? rial culture will remain (and move) together. Ceramic artifacts other than sherds as well as other objects of material culture are assigned a Material Culture Number (MC#) sequentially as the excava? tion progresses in a given square. They are also tied to the recording of the pottery bag, but, since the numbers are assigned in the square notebook, there may be more than one MC#58 but there will only be one MC#58 from Area/Square 62?that from pottery bag N.III.62.29, which is assigned to Locus 6210. The present volume, therefore, presents the second of the two-part final report on our excavations at the ancient city of Naukratis, specifically the work at Kom Hadid. Chapter 1, by the present author, attempts to describe the stratigraphy and supply interpretation for the excavations in the major areas of Kom Hadid. Although the interpretations are those of the author, their formulation was assisted by the fine stratigraphical eye of Cynthia Johnson-Romy who did much to put this material in order. Ultimately these chapters are based on the meticulous excavation done by an exceptionally dedicated cadre of volunteers and faithfully recorded by area/square and field supervisors. The Locus Summaries appended to each chapter reflect the work of many of the staff members and specialists. Chapter 2, based on the pottery from Kom Hadid, is the work of Andrea Berlin who joined us late in the study phase of our project, but whose scholarship and personality breathed new life into the publication pro? cess. Her work attempts to put the situation at Naukratis into the wider Egyptian and even Medi? terranean perspective. Chapter 3, dealing with miscellaneous pieces of the material culture, is not intended to be the last word on these pieces but rather an attempt to present them in a manner in which others might make use of them in future research. Especially important has been the assistance and expertise on the animal bones and shells that David Reese has given to the Naukratis Project since its inception. Because David was not able to work with the shell material on site, the author made a series of sample cards of distinctive shells by which all field identifications were made (usually by Joanne Curtain and other Simon Fraser University students). Through the kindness of the Egyptian Organization of Antiquities, we were able to obtain these cards during our "division" and David was finally able to handle the shells that he had previously only been able to work with through photo? graphs. In the study of the animal bones David was equally hampered since only a small percentage of the total sample (and that randomly selected) was allowed to us at the division. The fish bones from the project's part of the division were sent to Douglas Brewer and his help is also acknowledged here.</page><page sequence="8">1998 Preface Finally, the author would like to take this opportunity to thank all of those who labored at Kom Hadid. I find it incredible that so much "good archaeology" was done in the constant face of extreme heat, continual dust, innumerable flies, omnipresent fleas, Halazoned water, tepid Tang, miserably redundant meals, extremely limited shower facilities, closely cramped quarters, constant sickness, and nocturnal leapings of the canal to the field toilets. Such strength reflects a dedication to a project that I have never experienced elsewhere. Surely, somewhere in the future, a cold Stella awaits us as our just reward. The preliminary season of the Naukratis Project, funded by a Research and Development grant awarded by the Smithsonian Institution, was conducted during a three-week period in December 1977 and January 1978. The four excavation and study seasons (1980-1983) were funded by match- ing grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The author wishes to acknowledge the Endowment's continued support of the project. Matching funds were provided by the Graduate School and the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota, by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the University of Missouri-Columbia, Carleton College, the College of St. Catherine, Gustavus Adolphus College, Honeywell Inc, the 3H Industries in Sunnyvale (CA), and by private individuals. RCA, Inc. provided much of the computer hardware used in the field. Co-directors of the project were William D. E. Coulson, University of Minnesota, who was in charge of the survey project from 1980-1983 as well as the soundings at sites within the survey area, and the present author, then at the University of Missouri-Columbia, who was in charge of the exca? vations at Kom Ge'if and Kom Hadid. The Naukratis Project is indebted to the invaluable help provided by the American Research Cen? ter in Egypt and by its directors at the time of fieldwork, Paul Walker and Robert Wenke. Mme. Attiya Habachi from her desk in the Cairo office also provided many helpful suggestions. Assistance was also provided by many Egyptian officials: Ahmed el-Sawy, former Director General of the Egyp? tian Antiquities Organization, Hashem el-Alfy and Ibrahim Amir, former Chief Inspectors of the West and South Delta Inspectorates respectively, Youssef el-Gheriani and Doreya Said, former Direc? tors of the Graeco-Roman Museum in Alexandria, Dia abu Ghazi, former Director General of Egyp? tian Museums, and Mohammed Mohsem and Mohammed Saleh, former Directors of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Inspectors assigned to the Naukratis Project by the Egyptian Antiquities Organiza? tion were Faten Abdel Halim, Sabry Taha Hassanein, and Adly Roshdy Amin. Thanks also go to the antiquities guard at Kom Ge'if, Ahmed Shehab Mousa, and his family for help and kindness and to Abdel Monem, mayor of the municipality. The preparation of this manuscript was greatly assisted by a Research Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1990, and by several Small Grants awarded by the University of Arizona. Most site photography was done by the author, while most of the object photography was done by the late Duane Bingham, our project photographer. Pottery illustrations were drawn in the field by a number of volunteers who were supervised by Susan Osgood who, literally, drew hundreds of sherds herself. Each sherd was checked against its drawing by the author in the field and any errors are solely his. Pottery drawings were inked primarily by Cynthia Johnson-Romy assisted, in the later years, by Lois Kane and Kate Mackay. Much of the artwork for this volume was destroyed by nature in 1989. The ensuing chore of recreating illustrations from the original (in-field) pencil drawings caused considerable delay in the appearance of this volume. All plate layout was initially done by the author but assisted in the later stages by Lois Kane and Kate Mackay often working at the suggestion</page><page sequence="9">xii Preface AASOR 55 of Andrea Berlin. The author wishes to offer special thanks to Kate Mackay who has been especially helpful in the production of the final draft of this manuscript, and without whose diligence this volume would not have been possible. The final manuscript on Kom Hadid was prepared before and without benefit of the comparative material from Tel Anafa (Tel Anafa L, i-ii: Final Report on Ten Years of Excavation at a Hellenistic and Roman Settlement in Northern LsraeL, by Sharon C. Herbert. Journal of Roman Archaeology Supplemen- tary series No. 10, Parts 1-2.) which will be of great interest to readers of this volume. The author would also like to thank Sharon for her valuable suggestions during the final phases of the production of this manuscript.

The survey portion of the project was directed by William D. E. Coulson (1996), while the excavation portion was directed by the present author. Remnants of this ancient emporia are preserved (albeit very poorly) in the small village of Kom Ge'if, located 80 km southeast of Alexandria, a few miles to the west of the highway that connects the modern port to Cairo (fig. 1.1). For the sake of presentation, these remains can be divided into two main areas: the mound in the village Kom Ge'if (Leonard 1997), and the area northeast of Kom Ge'if and east of the lake that has filled the depression left by the work of the earlier excavators that is spe? cifically known to the local villagers as Kom Hadid (Mound of Iron, fig. 1.2; pl. 1.1). Initially our attention had been drawn to Kom Hadid during the winter survey of 1977-78, because its surface was densely covered by lumps of a vitreous material that, at first, we interpreted as metal slag since the Arabic word hadid means "iron." However, in this area Sir William Flinders Petrie had encountered "eight to ten foot high slag heaps" (fig. 1.3), which he identified as the product(s) of a lime-slaking industry, fed by the limestone blocks that had originally come from the monumental entryway that had been added to the Great Temenos during the reign of Ptolemy II (Coulson and Leonard 1979: 155, and Coulson and Leonard 1981: 48). In 1980 the true nature of this glossy detritus was clarified when, during an on-site study of the material, Dean George Rapp, Jr. (Archaeological Laboratory at the University of Minnesota-Duluth) identified the material as "kiln waste" or "furnace product"? evidently the residue from a (still unlocated) ceramic industry in the neighborhood. Associated with his heaps of slag (that he recorded but evidently did not excavate), Petrie mentioned finding "large substructures of red baked Roman brick, some chambers of which . . . (exhibited) . . . many successive coats of painted frescoes" (Petrie 1886: 4); unfortunately no architectural evidence for such remains were visible during either the general area survey of 1977-78 or the intensive survey of Naukratis and its environs in 1980 and 1981. With the hope that the tremendous quantity of furnace product on the present surface would indicate the location of an ancient kiln, as well as clarify Petrie's reference to the frescoed brick cham? bers, six squares (4.0 x 4.0m) were opened at Kom Hadid during the 1982 season (fig. 1.4). They were (in numerical order): Areas 48, 62, 63, 76, 130, and 144, but are discussed below in the approx- imate order in which they were opened. For the purposes of presentation, the work at Kom Hadid can be viewed as two separate operations: the excavations in the northern/northwestern part of the site (Areas 130 and 144), where indications of a wall were thought to have been detected during a sweeping of the general area prior to excavation; and near the top of the shallow kom (Areas 48, 62, 63, and 76)</page><page sequence="18">Albert Leonard, Jr. AASOR 55 Fig. 1.1. Map of Egypt showing the location of ancient Naukratis and the area surveyed by the Naukratis project. (John Huffstut in Coulson and Leonard 1981b: 39, fig. 1). in an area in which digging by the omnipresent sebakhin (local farmers) had produced fragments of lamps, terracotta figurines, and what appeared to be chunks of painted plaster. Areas 130 and 144 On the northwestern edge of the mound, in the area that would later be excavated as Area 130 and Area 144, a ridge of soil had been noticed running north-south, apparently having been left by the sebakhin as being too firmly compacted to dig easily. Because the ridge was relatively straight, it was felt that the soil differentiation might represent the side of a mudbrick wall. In addition, building debris and detritus were visible on the surface here, and similar material covered the surface of the mound to the west (the future Area 144), a logical place for it to have fallen from the hypothesized wall. However, excavation in Areas 130 and 144 produced only mudbrick detritus, and no contiguous mudbrick was encountered. Work in these two areas was halted when labor was required for investi- gating Wall 7612/6212 in the center of the mound (see below). At one time a structure must have existed somewhere in the neighborhood of Areas 130 and 144, but unfortunately it could not be detected during our two small (and brief) soundings in the area. Areas 48, 62, 63, and 76 The four areas of excavation that were opened on the top of the low mound are presented below in the approximate order in which they were excavated (fig. 1.5; pl. 1.2). In general, the stratigraphy in these areas can be summarized, as can most of the stratigraphy at Kom Hadid, as a series of simple sediment and debris layers, occasionally interrupted by pits and animal burrows. The matrices of the debris layers all share building rubble as a common attribute.</page><page sequence="19">1998 The Excavations at Kom Hadid Cemetery. WUM. 200m Fig. 1.2.

The surface of Area 76 sloped sharply downward from west to east, dropping as much as 80 cm across the four meter area (see especially the East Section drawing [fig. 1.6]); and much of this slope was the direct result of previous agricultural digging activity. Our excavation was begun at the higher elevation with a probe (Locus 7602) through Topsoil 7601 that immediately exposed the full extent of Pit 7603. Pit 7603, containing an enormous amount of pottery mixed with pieces of faience and fragments of terracotta figurines (see Locus Summaries), had been dug into Sediment 7604, which consisted of building debris in the form of mortar, plaster, and fired brick fragments. Sediment 7604 covered another pit, Locus 7609, that was also filled with intact fired bricks and brick fragments, large sherds, painted plaster, and kiln waste. In turn, Pit 7609 had been dug into Sediment 7611, which was exposed but not excavated. Elsewhere in the square, below the level of Sediment 7604, Locus 7605 was encountered. As was the case with Sediment 7604, Locus 7605 also contained building debris and kiln waste, but much of the locus had been severely contaminated by much animal burrowing. Debris layer 7606 was the first locus to be encountered that covered the entire east/west axis of the square (Sediments 7604 and 7605 had both been eroded or dug out toward the east). It was also rela? tively free of the animal burrowing so characteristic of Locus 7605. In fact, the only real distinction between Locus 7606 and Locus 7605 was the absence of the burrows. Cut into both Loci 7605 and 7606 was Pit 7610, the matrix of which consisted of at least three distinct components: kiln waste, pockets of ash, and decomposed particles of fired brick, a mixture that could have been the by-product of a burning or kiln operation. Unfortunately, animal burrows had also severely disturbed Pit 7610. Beneath Sediment 7606 was Locus 7608, a debris layer that could be associated with the collapse of mudbrick Wall 7612 that extended into the square for about two meters from the east balk before disappearing into the south balk, forming a triangle of exposed wall surface in the southern end of the square (pl. 1.3). Locus 7608 was the material formed by the deterioration of the upper portion of Wall 7612; the upper portion had slumped and covered the wall itself. Below Locus 7608, the next three debris layers (Locus 7613, Locus 7618, and Locus 7619) are considered to represent collectively the northward collapse of Wall 7612. In each descending layer the percentage of detritus and loose (but intact) mudbricks to the soil matrix increased noticeably. Removal of these layers and Pit/Trench Locus 7617, revealed eight intact courses of mudbrick in Wall 7612. Unfortunately, at this point the rising ground water was encountered. It is presumed that the wall continued below the present water table since neither a use-surface nor a foundation trench was encountered before water filled the bot? tom of the excavation area and forced us to stop digging (pl. 1.3). Along the three uppermost preserved courses on the northern side of Wall 7612, a trench (Locus 7617) had been cut, evidently in antiquity. It was about 0.20-0.25 m wide at the top of the wall, taper- ing toward the wall and joining it beneath the third (from the top) preserved course of brickwork. At first Trench 7617 was considered to have been a foundation trench for Wall 7612; but this view was dismissed eventually as more courses of the wall were encountered below the bottom of Trench 7617, and also because the bricks above and below the bottom of Trench 7617 were of similar size, color, and composition. Trench 7617 was found filled with crushed kiln waste and many sherds, including some nearly intact small vessels, and may have been a robber's trench. Any suggestion as to what was robbed, however, would be pure speculation.</page><page sequence="23">00 7611 7606 7616 N A r ? Fig. 1.5. Kom Hadid. Plan of east-west, mudbrick Wall 761216212/4812 (J.

It also produced a surprising array of items of material culture, such as bits of faience, terracotta figurine fragments, and an intact saucer lamp (see Ch. 3 #18), suggesting that this material may represent an intentional fill-deposit brought in from elsewhere (see Locus Summa? ries). Debris Layer 7618, beneath Locus 7613, produced mudbricks, painted plaster, and small frag? ments of a pebble-in-mortar pavement. More fragments of such a pavement were found in debris Layer 7619, just above the point where ground water was reached and excavation had to cease in Area 76. As excavated, Area 76 can be considered to consist of two basic strata. The later (upper) stratum is characterized by the presence of soils rich in kiln waste or furnace product. Interestingly, kiln waste, combined with building debris, appeared in every layer above and including Locus 7606 (i.e. Loci 7601, 7603, 7604, 7605, 7606, 7609, 7610); but it appeared in only one other locus, the possible robber Trench 7617 that ran alongside Wall 7612. This suggests that at some point after the hypothe- sized stone facing had been removed from Wall 7612, Trench 7617 began to fill with kiln waste (proba? bly encouraged and hastened by rain wash). The freshly defaced portion of Wall 7612 subsequently fell apart, resulting in the creation of Layer 7608 that covered and sealed Trench 7617. The earlier (lower) stratum, consisting of the material beneath Locus 7608, appears to have remained free from any disturbance after the destruction of Wall 7612. From the debris found in Loci 7613, 7618 and 7619, it can be suggested that the large structure, of which Wall 7612 formed a part, had been provided with an aggregate pavement floor and had walls embellished with three-dimen- sional, painted plaster, possibly above a cut-stone veneer. Area 62 The excavations described above exposed eight courses of a mudbrick wall and produced substan? tial evidence for elaborate architectural decoration in the southern portion of Area 76, but this work did not provide any evidence for the size of the wall or give any indication of the dimensions of the structure with which we were dealing. Therefore, excavation was initiated in Area 62, directly to the east of Area 76, in an attempt to trace the eastern extension of Wall 7612 that was recorded as Locus 6212 in this square. The bricks of this impressive wall were encountered at different levels across the excavation area, suggesting one of the following hypotheses: the wall had been built in several phases; the upper courses of the wall had decayed at different rates; or, the top of the wall had been damaged severely by the sebakhin. The third hypothesis seemed to us to be the most plausible. Wall 6212 was traced across the entire four-meter width of Area 62 (fig. 1.5), producing mudbrick Wall 7212/6212 with a minimum length of approximately seven meters. The length alone indicated that we were dealing with a substantial structure, but at that point we still did not have definite evidence for the width of the wall (pl. 1.4). Area 63 Area 63 was the third of the four areas to be opened in an attempt to define Wall 7612 which had been partially exposed in the southeast quadrant of Area 76 and traced (as Wall 6212) across Area 62, sit- uated immediately to the east. This work had uncovered the northern face of the wall, but its southern face had not been exposed because it ran into the southern balk across the entire width of Area 62 (fig. 1.5). To clarify the situation and to uncover the width of Wall 7612/6212, Area 63 was opened imme? diately to the south ofArea 62 (fig. 1.4). For this reason excavation was conducted only in the northern 1.50 m of the square.</page><page sequence="26">10 Albert Leonard, Jr. AASOR 55 Because of the nature of this probe and the fact that the excavation of Area 63 was begun late in the season, Locus 6301 and Locus 6302, the upper two sediment/debris layers (open and most probably contaminated), were quickly removed to an elevation corresponding to the top of Wall 7612/6212. Surprisingly, this work did not produce any trace of the wall. However, when the 1.0 m balk that sepa? rated Area 62 from Area 63 was excavated to that level, both the top of the wall and its southern face were encountered beneath Debris Locus 6304 (pls. 1.5 and 1.6). Finally, it could be demonstrated that we were dealing with a wall that averaged c. 1.70-1.75 m in width. The loci excavated above the collapse of Wall 6212 (including debris Layers 6301, 6302, and 6304) all contained building debris, kiln waste, and a large quantity of pottery. Cutting into both Layers 6302 and 6304 was Pit 6310 that continued into Area 62 (as Pit 6310/6210), where it met the top of Wall 6212 at the east balk. A second intrusion, Pit 6308, containing a large quantity of kiln waste and fired bricks, had also been cut into Layer 6304. This is the same sequence of debris loci and pits that had been noticed elsewhere at Kom Hadid. Layer 6305, interpreted here as the southward collapse of Wall 6212 in Area 63, consisted of mud? brick detritus, loose mudbrick fragments, and, again, a large quantity of pottery. Removal of a small section of Layer 6305 that had been deposited against the southern face of Wall 6212 revealed five courses of brickwork. Due to temporal considerations, excavation ceased in this area at an arbitrary level established within the matrix of debris Layer 6305, but Wall 6212 most probably continued deeper, as was indicated in the probe in Area 76. Area 48 Area 48, the final area to be excavated at Kom Hadid, was opened in order to trace the eastern limits of the massive mudbrick Wall 7612/6212 that had already been uncovered in Area 76 and Area 62 (figs. 1.4, 1.5). It was also hoped that this work might present us with a corner, or second wall joining the main wall, which would give some definition to the structure. However, the huge mudbrick wall continued eastward in a straight line across the excavated portion of Area 48, and no other wall was encountered (fig. 1.5; pls. 1.6 and 1.7). Because of temporal constraints, only the western portion (1.50 x 4.00 m) ofArea 48 was excavated, but the following stratigraphy was observed. Beneath top soil, Locus 4801, a solid layer of mudbrick detritus, Locus 4802, covered the entire excavation area. Below this was debris Layer 4803 character? ized by a dense admixture of kiln waste and fragments of fired brick. Also beneath Locus 4802 was Pit 4810, a loose fill of large chunks of kiln waste and fragments of brick rubble that could be equated with Pit 6210 in Area 62. After the removal of sediment Layer 4805 (below Loci 4810 and 4803), Wall 4812 was encoun? tered, the top of which had been partly disturbed by an animal burrow or robber trench (Locus 4806), forming a shallow channel along the northern edge of the wall. As exposed, Wall 4812 consisted of six or seven rows of irregularly laid mudbricks with an average width of c. 1.70 m. Removal of debris Layer 4808 to the north and Layer 4807 to the south of Wall 4812 enabled us to delineate three courses of the wall before excavation was terminated at an arbitrary level in both Locus 4808 and Locus 4807. Time did not permit further excavation. The Structure at Kom Hadid The building of which Wall 7612/6212/4812 had once formed a part, was a substantial structure with at least one room measuring more than nine meters on a side. Although we have no idea of the</page><page sequence="27">1998 The Excavations at Kom Hadid 11 plan of the structure, it does not seem excessive to postulate the presence of a second story, based on the thickness of that wall. Finds from loci sealed by the collapse of the wall suggest that the structure had at one time been provided with a pavement of aggregate possibly embellished further with sections of opus sectile and/or opus alexandrinum. Its walls appear to have been decorated with lime plaster that had been painted in panels of solid color, stripes, and faux marble, inscribed with lines suggesting margin- ally drafted blocks of stone, and even sculpted into architectural moldings in the distinctive "Masonry Style" that was the vogue throughout the Mediterranean (Hellenistic/Campanian/Ptolemaic/Hasmo- nean) world of the second and early first centuries B.C. In addition to the substantial size and elaborate decoration of the building, the frequency of frag? ments of faience bowls, molded lamps, terracotta figurines, terra nigra vessels and the stamped handles of imported amphorae bear further witness to the importance of the section (or suburb) of ancient Naukratis that is now known as Kom Hadid. It is unfortunate that, because of the height of the water table in this area, only eight courses of the wall could be excavated, and that any occupation surface of the structure is presently below ground water and therefore inaccessible through conventional means of excavation.

Combined with wall Locus 6212. 6212 Description. Huge mudbrick wall, constructed of large (avg. 32 x 14 x 10 cm) bricks in a variety of colors rang? ing from Very Dark Gray (10YR 3/1) through Dark Grayish Brown (10YR 4/2) to Dark Brown (10YR 3/3). The wall is six rows wide (ca. 1.70 m) and survives at least five courses high (in Area 62) to eight courses high (in Area 76). Seems to have been laid without mortar, in several different levels (phases?), which accounts for it having been assigned several different locus numbers during the course of excavation. No other walls could be associated with it. This wall continued into Area 76 (Locus 7612) through Area 48 (Locus 4812), and across Area 62 into its south balk. This wall is so long and so wide that it probably does not represent a simple, domestic architecture. 6213 Description. Canceled. Combined with Wall 6212. 6214 Description. Canceled.

Since only open (top-soil, probe, or pit) loci were excavated, very little (if any) of the pottery and other elements of material culture was saved. See the Locus Summaries pp. 11-24. 3 The top of Wall 7612 was fully exposed in Areas 62 and 48 (as Wall 6212 and Wall 4812 respectively). A few small fragments of cut and polished slabs of stone (c. 1.5 cm thick) were found in secondary archaeological con? texts in both Areas 48 and 62 (see Ch. 3 #64a and b) and are considered here to be indication of a pavement of opus sectile somewhere on the site. However, if pieces of such stone had been used to decorate the northern face of Wall 7612, they may have been considered to be of sufficient value (in this stone-impoverished area) to justify the digging. Support for such an alternate hypothesis might be the slight indentation at the point that Trench 7617 meets Wall 7612 (fig. 1.6). This might have served as a base for the facing. The irregular top of this wall was subsequently shaved to a common level to protect it and associated loci from contamination. Note that although a part of Wall 6212 did cross the southern boundary of Area 62 and continued into Area 63 in the balk, we continued to record the wall as Wall 6212, or the already cumbersome Wall 7212/6212, rather than creating an even clumsier "Wall 7612/6212/6312." 7To ease some of the pressure on the recording system, shell and animal bone were usually collected in the same bag, so some MC#s may contain a mixture of the two types of material culture. These were later separated and studied by the appropriate specialist. 8 Numbers in bold are inventory numbers used for this volume. Those in regular type are the original material cul? ture numbers (MC#) assigned in each square at the time of excavation.</page><page sequence="42">Chapter Two Naukratis/Kom Hadid: A Ceramic Typology for Hellenistic Lower Egypt Andrea M. Berlin Introduction Kom Hadid seems to have been a ceramic trash heap. Whereas the excavators could find no evi? dence of stratification on the small mound, they did recover tremendous quantities of pottery. This pottery consisted primarily of large fragments, many with a complete profile preserved. Close study reveals an unquestionable archaeological relationship between Kom Hadid and the nearby mound of Kom Ge'if, where settlement was continuous from the early fourth century to about the middle of the first century B.C. Not only is almost every ceramic shape and type variation found at Kom Hadid matched by stratified examples from Kom Ge'if, but in addition, both corpora lack certain widely available imported and/or decorated wares of the period (e.g. West Slope and/or Gnathia wares). Study of the two groups may thus be harmonized: the larger and more easily recognized forms from Kom Hadid are datable by their stratified appearance at Kom Ge'if, while some of the smaller frag? ments from Kom Ge'if can confidently be identified by comparison with the Kom Hadid assemblage. It appears that material from both mounds represents pottery available to, and used by, the Hellenistic settlers of Naukratis. While the fact of the relationship between Kom Ge'if and Kom Hadid is thus secure, its nature is ambiguous. Kom Hadid may have been an ancient depository, or even an ancient settlement whose architectural remains have disappeared. It may just as likely comprise the residue from activities in or around Kom Ge'if since antiquity, or even be related to the excavations of Sir Flinders Petrie at the end of the last century (it appears impossible to correlate precisely the areas in which he worked with the preserved sections of the present site). The location of the modern village immediately on and within the site's environs precluded large-scale topographic investigation or exploratory probes, so that the boundaries and full extent of the Hellenistic period settlement remain unknown. There may have been, for example, several areas of Hellenistic settlement, of which Kom Ge'if was the only one explored; if so, then the Kom Hadid pottery may derive from another contemporary area. The Kom Hadid pottery corpus is almost certainly complete for its period: it includes types from every occupation phase found at Kom Ge'if, and so is chronologically comprehensive; and it contains as well every necessary type of household vessel, and so is functionally whole. The absence, noted above, of some common Hellenistic decorated wares and forms might seem to contradict this last statement, especially since examples of all of these are attested at nearby Alexandria. The Alexandria vessels, however, simply indicate that these wares were available in this general region. Their absence from the excavated assemblages of both Kom Ge'if and Kom Hadid suggests that the site's ancient inhabitants did not, or could not, acquire them. The more limited character of the Naukratis 26</page><page sequence="43">1998 A Ceramic Typology for Hellenistic Lower Egypt 27 pottery is a direct reflection of the site's poverty, due to the recent foundation of Alexandria and its own vanished raison d'etre as a Greek trading depot. The location?too close to Alexandria to grow in its own right (as, for example, Pelusium at the opposite end of the Delta), but too far from the coast or a main branch of the Nile to offer any significant geographic advantage?precluded prosperity. The Naukratis assemblages, then, belonged to a series of poor, rural Hellenistic settlements. The pottery is grouped below by general shape and discussed by specific type, with correlations made to the Kom Ge'if stratigraphic sequence. Dating and distribution evidence from other sites? both in and outside of Egypt?is presented as well, though some wares and types have a different chronological history beyond their home region. The Naukratis assemblages are limited but typical? a circumstance that allows them to be presented as, in effect, a ceramic primer for rural Lower Egypt during the Hellenistic period. Finally, a chart summarizing the ceramic forms found at Naukratis and comparing the assemblage with that found at other sites in the eastern Mediterranean is offered in Table 2.6. Table Vessels The range of Hellenistic table wares found at Naukratis provides a telling reflection of the commu- nity's reduced status. Almost all of the vessels used for food and drink throughout the period were made of the local Delta silt, and only three shapes were common: thickened rim saucers, incurved rim bowls, and everted rim bowls (Table 2.1). These forms were new to the Egyptian ceramic corpus and were carefully modeled on recently acquired Greek originals. In fact, a few Attic and other imported black-glazed versions of these forms were found at Kom Hadid, all probably dating to the late fourth and early third centuries B.C. The Naukratis community was not alone in acquiring new, locally produced versions of Greek wares. Throughout the country, people adopted these shapes for their table vessels, but made them from the available Nile/Delta silt or desert marl clays (see parallels cited in shape discussions, below). As at Naukratis, these new table assemblages generally included few imported originals (Alexandria excepted). This combination of minimal imports and widespread, careful imitations is interesting on a number of counts. The quantity and fidelity of Egyptian production reflects knowledge of and admiration for the Greek originals. The relative paucity of these imported originals, however, reflects their general unavailability. This unavailability cannot be attributed to geography, since at large eastern Mediterra? nean sites outside the Ptolemaic realms, such as Antioch to the north and Sabratha to the west, Attic black glaze vessels were quite common (Waage 1948: 7?15; Gill 1986). It is true, however, that the quantity of imported pottery in general found within Egypt is notably less than that found at sites beyond. At Maskhuta, in the Delta, no Hellenistic period imports occur (Holladay 1982: 57); at Coptos, in Upper Egypt, they comprise no more than five percent of the total in the Hellenistic-period corpus (personal study). In comparison, at Berenice, in Tunisia, imported vessels slightly outnumbered local products (Kenrick 1985: 86). It is possible that the Ptolemies levied taxes on pottery imported into Egypt proper, as they did with other foreign products. Those living in the countryside contented them? selves with available and affordable imitations, which allowed the semblance of a Greek table service. One table shape found at Naukratis is not Greek in origin (see p. 29, plain rim saucer). This is a dish of medium size (both in height and width), with an almost straight wall, sometimes very slightly incurving rim, and flat bottom. This form is traditionally Egyptian, being first attested in Mid? dle Kingdom times; it apparently continued to be produced and used through the Hellenistic period.</page><page sequence="44">28 Andrea M. Berlin AASOR 55 Table 2.1. Hellenistic Table Vessels From Naukratis Later Hellenistic residents of Naukratis continued to use the same forms, still locally produced, as earlier Hellenistic residents. In the second century, black-slipped versions (terra nigra) appear, along with a few new shapes. Four local silt versions of a skyphos, perhaps imitating the Koan-Knidian cup, were found, along with one imported example. A few local beveled rim saucers and hemispherical bowls occur, and one imported black-glazed hemispherical bowl was found in topsoil. Remaining table vessels include three Eastern Sigillata A vessels (one platter and two cups), imported from south? ern Phoenicia, and dating to the later second or early first centuries B.C. (figs. 2.5:8, 2.12:3). Saucers The earliest saucer type found at Naukratis, the plain rim saucer, is a simple, shallow form with a slightly rounded, plainly finished rim (fig. 2.4:1-7). This first occurs at Kom Ge'if in NW 1C/N 1, and dates to the site's initial Hellenistic phase. The form itself is older still; in various fabrics and fin- ishes it was manufactured by Egyptian potters at least since Middle Kingdom times. This type was certainly manufactured during the preceding period; examples made of Delta silt were found in the fifth century B.C. warehouse excavated at Tel Maskhuta (Holladay 1982: pl. 15.10). Plain rim saucers are not common at Naukratis: a total of sixteen fragments were found at Kom Hadid and twenty-four at Kom Ge'if. At Kom Ge'if they appeared primarily in the lower levels, and some examples may well be residual debris of earlier occupations. Potters probably stopped making the form in favor of the new, and soon very popular, thickened rim saucer (figs. 2.1, 2.2). This type first appears at Kom Ge'if in NW 3B/N 2C and dates to the mid or late third century B.C. A total of one hundred fifty-eight frag? ments were found at Kom Hadid, and eighty-eight at Kom Ge'if (82 percent of the total number of saucers). Most are made of the local Delta silt and of these, a little over half are slipped a smooth, semi- lustrous red-brown. Beginning in the second century B.C, reduction-fired thickened rim saucers also appear at Naukratis, with gray-black paste and a slightly lustrous dull gray slip (fig. 2.3). The ware, an Egyptian version of Greek black glaze, is here called terra nigra. Regional production of terra nigra is attested</page><page sequence="45">1998 A Ceramic Typology for Hellenistic Lower Egypt 29 at Tell el-Fara'in, in the southwestern Delta, where kilns and workshops have been excavated (Seton- Williams 1967, 1969; Charlesworth 1969). Apparently potters there manufactured terra nigra table vessels exclusively. The widespread distribution of terra nigra throughout Egypt suggests that several production sites existed (Grataloup 1991: 23-26), though ethnographic studies show that a single specialized production site can supply a large area (Vossen 1984: 399-404). The Tell el-Fara'in potters made the three most popular table shapes of the Hellenistic corpus: thickened rim saucers, incurved rim bowls, and everted rim bowls (Seton-Williams 1967: figs. 2.5-10, 3.1-3, 5-8, 10-12, 17-19). All of these terra nigra vessels are copies of early Hellenistic forms, but none seem to have been produced before the late third or early second century B.C. The Tell el-Fara'in kilns themselves date to the sec? ond and first centuries B.C. The most securely dated terra nigra vessels from excavated domestic con? texts come from Coptos, Tell Timai (ancient Thmuis), and the House of Dionysos at Paphos, on Cyprus. At Coptos thickened rim saucers appear in third century levels (personal study); at Tell Timai, an everted rim bowl comes from a floor level dated c. 200-150, and a thickened rim saucer from a sub? sequent floor dated c. 150-125 (Ochsenschlager 1967: figs. 12, 27); at Paphos thickened rim saucers appear only in the late second century B.C. (Hayes 1991: fig. 5.4-6, from quarry pit in room AL, dated late second century B.C.). Terra nigra ware is attested as far south as Qasr Ibrim, where it again is dated to the later Hellenistic period (Adams n.d.: 13, 26-27 [Ware RBB]). Other examples, from Karnak and Tell Fara'on-Imet, are simply dated as "Hellenistic" (Grataloup 1991: fig. 1.1; Mostafa 1988: fig. 1.7). The Naukratis data may now be added in support of these later dates; terra nigra thickened rim saucers do not appear at Kom Ge'if until NW 7B, dated to the later second century B.C. The thickened rim saucer was a popular shape throughout the eastern Mediterranean. Imported and locally made versions?slipped, painted, or left plain?have been found at almost every excavated site (see table 2.6). The form was probably inspired by the neatly made fourth century Attic rolled rim plate, which was always covered in that ware's lustrous blue-black glaze and often had rouletted circles or other impressed designs on the interior (Sparkes and Talcott 1970: nos. 1058-1060, pl. 36, fig. 10; Rotroff 1997: 142-45, figs. 46-50, pls. 60-62). In its latest and most elaborate version, produced in the mid or late second century B.C., probably in the southeastern Mediterranean (perhaps even Alexan? dria), the shape was slipped black and given an interior circlet of white painted laurel leaves (see examples from Tarsus in Jones 1950: figs. 127.137 [import], 179.34, 36-38, A, B [local]). The form's size and profile made it practical and handy; its open design allowed decoration to show. In its many variants, it was clearly the standard choice when setting a table. In this regard, the residents of Naukratis were in step with the fashion. Only a few examples of two other saucer shapes were found at Kom Hadid. Both appear in second- century phases at Kom Ge'if. One is the drooping rim saucer, a vessel generally deeper than the thick? ened rim saucer, with a short, downturned rim (fig. 2.4:8?15). This type of rim usually occurs in conjunction with a specific body type in which an interior ridge encircles a small, central depression. The form is traditionally termed a "fish plate" on account of its similarity to larger late fourth century B.C. vessels that also have a downturned rim and central depression and have fish painted on them. The smaller, unpainted Hellenistic versions are unlikely to have been used for any fish larger than sar- dines and are here termed saucers. Evidence for this form in its entirety, in terra nigra, is provided by a complete example found among the debris of the Tell el-Fara'in kilns (Seton-Williams 1967: fig. 3.4). The upper parts of only five such vessels came from Kom Hadid and two from Kom Ge'if. All but one are in terra nigra. The Kom Hadid examples, though not preserved below mid-wall, probably had the central depression as well.</page><page sequence="46">30 Andrea M. Berlin AASOR 55 The last type of saucer found at Naukratis is the beveled rim saucer, a broad, relatively deep vessel with a neatly trimmed rim (fig. 2.5:1-4). Only three examples were found at Kom Hadid, and four at Kom Ge'if. Most are made of silt, though one is of terra nigra. This type appears at Kom Ge'if in NW 8A/N 3A-B, which dates to the second century B.C. Similar vessels have been found at Paphos (Hayes 1991: figs. 15.8, 41.31), Berenice (Riley 1979, nos. 621-622, fig. 110), and Coptos (personal study), all in second century B.C. contexts as well. The type seems largely confined to Egyptian/Ptolemaic sites; it is notably absent from contemporary, non-Ptolemaic sites such as Ashdod, Samaria, and Tarsus. Bowls/Cups Bowls/cups are distinguished from saucers by narrower, deeper profiles. They could have held either food or drink. All those found at Naukratis are little, suitable for small portions only. Four types occur, but only two are common. The first is the incurved rim bowl (figs. 2.6-2.8), which appears at Kom Ge'if in NW 2A/N 1-2B, the earliest Hellenistic phase. Attic and other imported black glaze versions of this form were found at Kom Hadid, but the majority of the Naukratis vessels are of Delta silt, both plain and slipped. Some of these local versions faithfully replicate the niceties of the imports: a carefully formed, sturdy ring foot, often beveled on its outer face; a sharply inturned rim, sometimes thinned to a narrow rounded point; slim, even walls, smoothly finished; and a low, balanced profile. Many of the Naukratis vessels, however, made of the less refined local silt, have irregular walls and uneven profiles, with rims lazily upturned and simply thickened, and cursory, barely ring feet. The form, no matter how it was finished, was clearly a household necessity: one hundred forty-nine fragments were found at Kom Hadid and two hundred thirty-nine at Kom Ge'if. In both their ubiquity and varying quality, the Naukratis bowls match those from other Hellenistic table assemblages; the incurved rim form?imported, local, slipped, and plain?is the most popular bowl type of the early Hellenistic period. The everted rim bowl appears slightly later and soon matches the incurved rim form in popularity (fig. 2.10). At Naukratis seventy-five fragments were found at Kom Hadid and thirty at Kom Ge'if; the type first appears at Kom Ge'if in NW 2B, and so dates to the third century B.C. Like the incurved rim bowl, this form was modeled on Attic and other imported black glaze versions, and a range of pro? files?from wide and shallow to deep and narrow?occurs. Everted rim bowls are very common in Hellenistic table assemblages, sometimes outnumbering incurved rim bowls. This may be due to their more adaptable form: the open, out-turned rim renders this shape suitable for both food and drink, whereas incurved rim bowls could be used only for food. Both forms continue in use through the second century B.C, during which time terra nigra ver? sions also appear (figs. 2.9, 2.11). These latter vessels may have come from the terra nigra kilns at Tell el-Fara'in; wasters of both shapes were found in the debris there (Seton-Williams 1967: figs. 2.7, 8, 10, 11, 3.1-3, 5-7, 10, 17-20). Terra nigra versions of incurved rim bowls first occur at Kom Ge'if in NW Hiatus A; everted rim vessels first occur in NW 4B. The second century date of these bowls, just as for the various saucer types, confirms a later Hellenistic date for terra nigra table vessels overall, at least in the Delta (they may occur earlier in Upper Egypt; at Coptos terra nigra appears already in strata of the third century B.C. [personal study]). The third type of bowl found at Naukratis is the so-called Koan-Knidian bowl (or cup), a fairly deep vessel with a carinated profile, sharply everted lip, and opposed horizontal coil handles pressed on beneath the rim (fig. 2.5:9?11). One imported vessel was found at Kom Hadid, along with one in slipped silt; three more local versions come from Kom Ge'if. At Kom Ge'if one occurs in NW 3B, a phase dated to the late third century B.C. partially because of the appearance of this type. The form is</page><page sequence="47">1998 A Ceramic Typology for Hellenistic Lower Egypt 31 elsewhere found in late third/early second century B.C. levels, and occurs almost everywhere that securely dated middle Hellenistic settlement is found. The last type of bowl found at Naukratis is the simple hemispherical bowl, an elegant form, nar? row and deep, with a plain, slightly pointed lip (fig. 2.12:1, 2). Only one securely identified fragment was found at Kom Hadid, and two at Kom Ge'if. One appears at Kom Ge'if in NW 4B and so dates to the second century B.C. (Berlin in Leonard 1997: 6.1:8). Two of the vessels are of slipped silt, while one is an import?black glazed, with white painted bands on both the interior and exterior of the rim. The general form is probably copied from glass versions, such as the monochrome east vessels of the Canosa Group, dating from the late third/early second century B.C. (Grose 1989: 186, fig. 92). These had no foot, and would have been used for drinking cups. Ceramic examples are not common, even including Eastern Sigillata A versions from the late second century B.C. Their rarity is probably related to their function: such drinking vessels?capacious but unable to be set down?were suitable for pro- longed and fancy parties, and those who could afford such entertainments probably owned these cups in glass or even plate. Cooking Vessels Cooking vessels are the heart of a household assemblage. At Naukratis, their importance is reflected in their numbers: the eleven different types found account for 26 percent of all vessels recovered (Table 2.2). The residents had at hand four distinct forms in which to prepare their meals: cooking pots, casseroles, stew pots, and baking dishes. The cooking pots have globular bodies, with short necks and relatively narrow mouths. The casseroles are just the opposite, having broad, fairly low bodies and wide mouths. The stew pots combine features of both: they have deep, round bodies and wide mouths. Finally, the baking dishes are low, broad, and flat-bottomed. Any of these forms could have carried a lid, but at both Kom Hadid and Kom Ge'if almost no obvious lids were found. The most likely are a few small, plain dishes with a stubby disc "foot" that seems more like a handle. These dishes are too small for any shape but the cooking pots, which in any case are the most likely to require a lid. The reason for this is simply the nature of the food prepared in each sort of vessel. Cooking pots are designed for soups or legume-based dishes, which require longer cooking without significant water loss. To this end, a lid is desirable. Casseroles and stew pots, on the other hand, are more suited to braising large chunks of food?as their wide mouths indicate. It is commonplace in ceramic studies to describe the rim and/or lip design of a casserole as having a "lid device," implying that they were then so used (Lapp 1961: 188-90, types 71.2, 72.1; Edwards 1975: 122-24; Riley 1979: 243). It is far less common, however, to actually find many (or even any!) lids wide enough to have covered these vessels. Lots of things may have been put to such use (saucers, for example, or large sherds from broken amphorae), but few seem to have been produced deliberately. All of the Naukratis cooking vessels are local productions, being made of plain or slipped Delta silt. But while their fabric is local, the ultimate origins of their various forms are largely Mediterra? nean. Though pots for cooking are naturally not a new item in the Egyptian ceramic corpus, cooking pots of the general shape found at Hellenistic Naukratis?with a globular body, a narrow mouth, and opposed short handles?do not appear in Egypt prior to the sixth century B.C. Casseroles are an even newer form in the Egyptian ceramic corpus; the first examples appear only in the early third century. These vessels are close versions of fourth century B.C. Greek casseroles (e.g. Sparkes and Talcott 1970: no. 1965, fig. 18). In fact, at this time Greek-style casseroles begin to appear throughout the south? eastern Mediterranean, a pronounced and widespread distribution that probably reflects the broad</page><page sequence="48">32 Andrea M. Berlin AASOR 55 Table 2.2. Hellenistic Cooking Vessels from Naukratis settlement of Greeks in this region. Most of these casseroles are locally manufactured rather than imported. Price may have been a factor, but it is also likely that local clays made adequate cooking wares, so that imported fabrics provided no real advantage. The residents of third century Naukratis had only cooking pots and casseroles in their kitchens. In the second century, however, residents also acquired locally made stew pots and baking dishes, along with four new casserole types. These second century forms are not similar to Greek types, and parallels occur in a restricted are from Cyprus to Palestine to Upper Egypt. Stew pots are the most confined in distribution, appearing only in Egypt. The Naukratis cooking vessels reflect the pronounced regional- ism of late Hellenistic ceramic production. It is interesting also to note that the second century resi? dents enjoyed a greater variety of cooking vessels than did the third century residents, a situation opposite to that of the table vessels. Cooking pots The earliest type of Hellenistic-period cooking pot found at Naukratis is the angled rim cooking pot (fig. 2.16:1-8). This is a globular vessel with a short, outwardly angled rim, and a smoothly flat? tened or slightly rounded lip. There is usually a small flange or ledge at the interior juncture of rim and wall, which would provide support for a lid. Not many angled rim cooking pots were found at Naukratis: eight came from Kom Hadid and twenty-five from Kom Ge'if, beginning there in NW IC. Other, similar vessels have been identified as variants (fig. 2.16:9-17). These have the outwardly angled rim, but difFer in having wider mouths and ridged or folded lips. These oddities may have been intended as stew pots, though none share that form's elongated neck (for which reason they are not included there). The angled rim cooking pot is specifically Hellenistic; the earliest parallels come from third century B.C contexts at Coptos (personal study), Alexandria (Adriani 1940: fig. 53.59), Paphos (Hayes 1991: fig. 28.W11.61), and Samaria (Crowfoot, Crowfoot, and Kenyon 1957: fig. 41.10-18; Zayadin 1966,</page><page sequence="49">1998 A Ceramic Typology for Hellenistic Lower Egypt 33 pl. 31.87). Vessels were made either with two vertical strap handles, or one vertical strap and one horizontal coil; the latter arrangement may imitate mainland Greek types (e.g. Edwards 1975: 123, nos. 657-58, pls. 28, 61; Sparkes and Talcott 1970: pl. 94.1957, but this is probably not itself Attic). None of the Naukratis fragments are sufficiently preserved to identify the number and form of handles. The second type of cooking pot found at Naukratis is the small ledge rim cooking pot (fig. 2.17:1? 10). This type has a short vertical neck, sometimes thickened or slightly bulging, topped by a small ledge rim. Only sixteen such vessels were found at Naukratis: eleven from Kom Hadid and five from Kom Ge'if. They first appear at Kom Ge'if in NW 3B, which dates to the third century B.C Small ledge rim cooking pots made of desert marl appear at Coptos in contexts of the late third century/ early second century B.C (personal study). A very similar form also appears in a third century domestic context at Samaria (Hennessy 1970: fig. 12.35). The small number recovered is surprising, since the form was apparently manufactured nearby at Kom Dahab (warped fragments of this type were recov? ered there; see Coulson and Wilkie 1986: fig. 18.E11.101.63). The third form found at Naukratis, the tall ledge rim cooking pot, is distinguished by a high straight neck topped by a slim but pronounced ledge (fig. 2.18). Some wasters of this form were recov? ered from Kom Dahab, indicating local production (Coulson and Wilkie 1986: fig. 18.El 1.12.9). The Naukratis vessels, all of which are in the local Delta silt, probably were made there. This is the most common cooking pot form found: fifty-two fragments were recovered from Kom Hadid, and twenty-three from Kom Ge'if. Examples first appear at Kom Ge'if in NW 3B. This early Hellenistic date is consistent with that of other Naukratis forms produced at Kom Dahab (see further, below). The tall flat rim cooking pot form occurs in both third and second century B.C contexts in Egypt, at Coptos (personal study) and Maskhuta (Holladay 1982: pls. 29.2, 30.1, 2), and elsewhere in the southeastern Mediterranean, at Paphos (Hayes 1991: fig. 29.6), Samaria (Crowfoot, Crowfoot, and Kenyon 1957: figs. 41.6, 43.12), Tel Anafa (Berlin 1997: 90, PW 201-206, pls. 23, 78), and Tarsus (Jones 1950: fig. 187C). It is likely that local production and use continued at Naukratis into the second century as well. The last type of cooking pot used at Naukratis is the plain rim cooking pot, so-called because the form's short, vertical neck was drawn up into a simple, rounded point (fig. 2.17:11-24). This type first appears at Kom Ge'if in NW 9A, but is never common: Fifteen fragments were found at Kom Hadid, and four at Kom Ge'if. Four of the Naukratis vessels are made of desert marl; the remainder are of Delta silt. All but two were partially slipped and/or painted on the exterior; some had slip dripped down the interior of the neck as well. The decoration might suggest that these vessels were intended as small jars instead of as cooking pots. However, similar vessels with decoration were found at Tel Anafa and were definitely used for cooking (Berlin 1997: 88, PW 184-86, pls. 21, 77). At Coptos, the same form, but without decoration, was so used as well (personal study). Both the Tel Anafa and Coptos cooking pots date to the late fourth/early third centuries B.C Stew pots The many stew pots found at Naukratis all appear to be versions of a single type, the ledge/folded lip stew pot (figs. 2.19, 2.20) This is a deep-bodied, wide-mouthed vessel, with a high neck and vari- ously thickened lip, finished as a roughly squared or triangular ledge. All vessels probably had opposed, wide, vertical strap handles. Stew pots were popular at Naukratis: a total of sixty-one fragments were found at Kom Hadid and thirty-eight at Kom Ge'if. One vessel is made of desert marl (fig. 2.20:16); all others are in the local Delta silt, and of these about half are slipped as well. The form first appears at Kom Ge'if in NW 4B, and so dates to the early/mid second century B.C Similar stew pots were also</page><page sequence="50">34 Andrea M. Berlin AASOR 55 found in second century B.C. contexts at Coptos; they include vessels made of a distinctive "bichrome" cooking ware as well as locally produced silt and marl versions (personal study). The limited distribu? tion is at odds with the form's popularity at Naukratis and Coptos. Perhaps as more Hellenistic kitchen wares are published, additional examples will come to light. Casseroles The first type of casserole found at Naukratis, and the only one that dates to the early Hellenistic period, is the angled rim casserole (fig. 2.21). This has a vertical or slightly angled wall, and a plainly finished, wide, angled rim. A small flange juts out at the interior juncture of the rim and wall. The type first appears at Kom Ge'if in NW 2B, which dates to the third century B.C. A total of eleven fragments were found at Kom Hadid and two at Kom Ge'if; all are in the local silt and about half are slipped. The Naukratis casseroles have opposed horizontal coil handles?a feature common to other third century B.C. examples?and one derived directly from Greek models; similar vessels have been found at Alex? andria (Adriani 1940: fig. 53.53) and Coptos (personal study). The second century versions more often have two small vertical strap handles; parallels occur at Berenice (Riley 1979: nos. 420, 423, fig. 98), Tell el-Herr (Gratien and Soulie 1988: fig. 3.9), Tell Timai (Ochsenschlager 1967: fig. 7), Ashdod (Do? than 1971: figs. 8.18, 99.11), Samaria (Crowfoot, Crowfoot, and Kenyon 1957: fig. 40.5; Hennessy 1970: fig. 7.34), Tel Anafa (Berlin 1997: 97-98, PW 234-40, pls. 28, 80), Paphos (Hayes 1991: figs. 32.1, 4, 33.1, 73.2), Knossos (Callaghan 1981: no. 51, fig. 8), and Athens (Thompson 1934: D72, E141, figs. 78, 121). The type appears at Sabratha as well (Dore 1989: 107, type 14, fig. 25), though not in dated Hellenistic contexts. The second casserole type to appear at Naukratis is the beveled lip casserole, a form similar to the angled rim type but with the additional finishing touch of a thickened triangular-shaped lip (figs. 2.22, 2.23). Though none were found at Kom Ge'if, thirty-one were found at Kom Hadid. All of the Naukratis vessels are in the local Delta silt, and of these, three-quarters were slipped. Parallels for this form appear in third and second century B.C. levels at Coptos (personal study) and in a second-century B.C. context at Maskhuta (Holladay 1982, fig. 30.5). Outside of Egypt examples appear only from second-century B.C. deposits (Paphos: Hayes 1991, fig. 32.1; Samaria: Crowfoot, Crowfoot, and Kenyon 1957: fig. 41.20; Akko-Ptolemais: Dothan 1976: fig. 30.12; Tel Anafa: Berlin 1997: 98-99, PW 241-47, pls. 29, 80; Sabratha: Dore 1989: 106 [a single example of type 7, fig. 23 is similar, and comes from a possible second century B.C. context]). The third casserole found at Naukratis, the inset rim casserole, has a vertical or slightly outwardly angled wall, sometimes offset midway (figs. 2.24-2.26). This terminates in a thickened, upright rim with an inset face. Handles, when present, are long horizontal coils, though parallels suggest that some vessels may have been handleless. A total of forty-three fragments were found at Kom Hadid and six at Kom Ge'if. All are in Delta silt and most are slipped. Local fabric notwithstanding, there are many small differences in profile and rim formation; these may reflect different manufacturers. Inset rim cas? seroles first appear at Kom Ge'if in NW 6B, and so date to the late second century B.C. An identical vessel, made of Delta silt, was found at Coptos in a late third-century B.C. deposit (personal study). Versions of this form occur at Sabratha (Dore 1989: type 21, fig. 25), Berenice (Riley 1979: nos. 424- 37, fig. 98), Paphos (Hayes 1991: figs. 33.6, 73.6), Tel Anafa (Berlin 1997: 100-101, PW 254-58, pls. 30, 80), Corinth (Edwards 1975: nos. 670-671, pl. 29), and Athens (Thompson 1934: C74, E145, fig. 121)?all from second century contexts. The fourth type of casserole that appears at Naukratis is the squared lip casserole (fig. 2.27). It dif- fers from the beveled lip form only in the rim terminus, here thickened into a squared lip rather than</page><page sequence="51">1998 A Ceramic Typology for Hellenistic Lower Egypt 35 neatly tooled off. At Naukratis, this type appears at Kom Ge'if in NW 7B, late in the second century B.C: Ten fragments have been identified from Kom Hadid and four from Kom Ge'if. All are in Delta silt and about half are slipped. Squared lip casseroles may be nothing more than sloppily made beveled lip forms. Identification as a separate type is suggested by very similar vessels, also found in late second century B.C. contexts, at Tell Maskhuta (Holladay 1982: pl. 30.4), Paphos (Hayes 1991: figs. 33.5: 73.1), and Tel Anafa (Berlin 1997: 99-100, PW 248-53, pls. 29, 80). The final casserole type found at Naukratis is also one of the only first century B.C forms at the site: folded lip casseroles (figs. 2.28-2.31). These are wide vessels with a broad ledge rim, thickened at the outer edge. This thickened lip looks as if it was folded over, although it was probably simply tooled off. Folded lip casseroles appear at Kom Ge'if beginning in NW Hiatus C; forty-seven frag? ments were found at Kom Hadid and four at Kom Ge'if. All examples are in Delta silt and half are slipped both inside and out. Parallels occur at Mendes (Wilson 1982, pl. XIII.4, dated "late Hellenistic"), Coptos (personal study) and Tel Anafa (Berlin 1997: 101, PW 259-65, pls. 30, 80)?the latter two in contexts dated to the early first century B.C The Egyptian vessels are made of silt (Naukratis, Mendes, Coptos) and/or marl (Coptos) clays; the Tel Anafa examples are of a sandy cooking fabric perhaps imported from the coastal city of Akko-Ptolemais. The casserole's essentially simultaneous appearance over a fairly wide area is probably the result of a single, popular, broadly distributed prototype. The fact that three out of the four sites at which such casseroles occur are in Egypt suggests an Egyptian origin, but this is no more than a hypothesis. Baking dishes A single form of baking dish was found at Naukratis, here named the plain rim baking dish (figs. 2.32, 2.33). The shape is simple: broad and low, with thick, angled walls, and a plain rim. Some frag? ments preserve a thick horizontal coil handle, sometimes pulled up into a loop handle. Brian Sparkes (1962: 129, pl. V.5) discusses similar vessels found in the Athenian Agora; their high handles, which would facilitate lifting, might indicate use as a portable hearth. Not many such vessels were found at Naukratis: twenty-three fragments at Kom Hadid and only one at Kom Ge'if. The Kom Ge'if fragment appears in NW 8B, and so dates towards the end of the period. All of the Naukratis vessels were iden? tified as being made of the local Delta silt, and almost all were slipped. Vessels identical in form to those from Naukratis, but in a gold-mica flecked fabric and with a heavily carbonized interior, appear at sites throughout the eastern Mediterranean, also all from later Hellenistic contexts. They are not numerous at any individual site, however. A single origin for the micaceous baking dishes is probable, given the combination of their limited numbers and their wide distribution; the gold-colored mica within the fabric may indicate the region around Pergamon (Slane 1986: 312, n. 76). Lids While any saucer or bowl could have been used as a lid when necessary, included here are only vessels made of cooking ware, and so apparently designed to cover other cooking vessels. The single type found at Naukratis is the small dish-lid, a simple form that could have been used as a saucer as well; it has a plain rim and stubby disc foot-handle (fig. 2.50:15, 16). Dish-lids first appear at Kom Ge'if in NW 2B, but are uncommon: Three fragments were found at Kom Hadid and nine at Kom Ge'if. Their size makes them usable only with cooking pots (which also appear in the third century phases of the site). Comparable vessels appear at sites throughout the eastern Mediterranean in third and second century contexts, including Sabratha (Dore 1989: fig. 39.98.3295), Berenice (Riley 1979: nos. 759-65, 797-98, figs. 118-19), Alexandria (Adriani 1940: pl. 30.25, lower left), Coptos (personal study), Ashdod</page><page sequence="52">36 Andrea M. Berlin AASOR 55 (Dothan 1971: fig. 24.11), Samaria (Reisner, Fischer, and Lyon 1924: fig. 184.32a; Crowfoot, Crowfoot, and Kenyon 1957: fig. 41.22), Paphos (Hayes 1991: fig. 25.5, 30.3), Tarsus (Jones 1950: no. 223, figs. 135, 187, 191.D), and Athens (Thompson 1934: A58, fig. 8, D73, fig. 78). The form, which is the essence of simplicity, did not change, and vessels were probably produced locally in each case. Utility Vessels Utility vessels include large and small containers designed for mixing, pouring, and storing dry and wet goods (Table 2.3). Such vessels are generally undecorated, though often carefully fashioned and finished; their plain appearance reflects their everyday function. Most common at Naukratis are large forms: jugs, kraters, dinoi, and amphorae. The less common small vessels include juglets and unguentaria. Some fragments of low, heavy stands were found; their plain fabric and lack of burning indicate that they were used for water jars or amphorae. Lastly, there are vessels for storage: large and small jars, a pithos, and deep basins. A shape series here called shallow basins may have actually been used for any number of functions, from lids for deep basins to bread molds. Most of the utility vessels from Naukratis are of the local Delta silt; in fact, wasters from the nearby kiln at Kom Dahab indicate that two jug and two amphora types were manufactured there (see Table 2.5). Local potters thus regularly supplied Naukratis residents with containers necessary for serv? ing and storing the local vintage. This utility assemblage also includes some regional and Mediterra? nean imports: two imported black-glazed unguentaria, a few Upper Egyptian marl jugs and kraters, a couple of jugs from Aswan, six Aegean lagynoi, and six Koan amphorae. Other imported amphorae are attested by forty-three stamped handles?some found by Petrie and others in the course of this project's excavation. These include twenty-two Rhodian handles, three Thasian, six Knidian, two Samian, one Latin, one Chian, and one of the Egyptian Zenon group (Coulson, Wilkie and Rehard 1986; for a chronological breakdown, see Table 2.4). Note that of the twenty-four dated handles, eighteen are early Hellenistic (through Grace's Period III, ending 175 B.c), and only six are late Hellenistic. In the early Hellenistic period, at least, it seems that the Naukratis residents could afford some more expensive goods and were not cut off from the larger Mediterranean economy. This pattern is somewhat differ? ent from other Egyptian and southeastern Mediterranean sites, where Period IV-V handles (188-108 B.C.) are sometimes more, and sometimes almost as numerous (see discussions in Ariel 1990: 18-21 and table 2; Berlin 1997: 162). An especially notable and relevant example is Alexandria, where there are three times as many late Hellenistic (Period V) handles as middle Hellenistic (Period IV) ones (Grace 1985: 42). The decline in late Hellenistic imported amphorae at Naukratis further underscores the pov- erty and relative isolation of that period's settlement. Unguentaria A very small number of this normally ubiquitous Hellenistic form occurs at Naukratis: twelve fragments from Kom Hadid (fig. 2.34:1-12) and four from Kom Ge'if. Eight are made of Delta silt and six of these are slipped, three are terra nigra, one is desert marl, and two are black-glazed imports. The marl vessel is the first to appear at Kom Ge'if, in NW 2A; plain and slipped silt unguentaria do not occur there until NW Hiatus B and C respectively. The Naukratis vessels were probably supplied from Alexandria. Notably, there is no evidence for production at either of the kiln sites in the region (Kom Dahab and Tell el-Fara'in). No two of the Naukratis unguentaria are identical. Most, however, have a profile similar to a com? mon eastern Mediterranean form, the banded fusiform unguentarium. These include two intact silt</page><page sequence="53">1998 A Ceramic Typology for Hellenistic Lower Egypt 37 Table 2.3.

Chronology of Stamped Amphora Handles Found at Naukratis (dates and identifications from Coulson, Wilkie and Rehard 1986) vessels from Kom Ge'if and all of the fragments from Kom Hadid (fig. 2.34:1-12). This form has a slim pear-shaped body atop a short, narrow peg-like toe, a short, narrow neck and a cupped rim. Painted bands encircle the lower neck and shoulder. The first versions come from Athens, in contexts of the early third century B.C; the vessels are reduction-fired, with thin white bands around the neck and shoulder (Thompson 1934: A64, 65, fig. 9, B6, fig. 15; for the probable Athenian origin see Rotroff 1984: 258). Valuable contents, portable size, and well-established long-distance trade routes made the Attic vessels available throughout Greece, from Argos (Bruneau 1970b: 518, fig. 210:57.3, 57.4, 58.8, 185.23) and Corinth (Pemberton 1985: T2014, pl. 80) in the Peloponnesos to Amphipo- lis in Thrace (Samartzidou 1988: pl. 9); in the Aegean, on Delos (Bruneau 1970a: D154-158, pl. 46); in Asia Minor, at Labraunda (Hellstrdm 1965: 25); on Cyprus, at Paphos (Hayes 1991: 68, pl. 14.7) and Vrysi (Dray, du Plat Taylor, and du Plat Taylor 1951: 109-110, fig. 58.2); and in Palestine, at Tel Anafa (Berlin 1997: 67, PW 110, pl. 15). The wide availability of these Attic models apparently inspired other eastern Mediterranean producers to imitation; by the later third century B.C, versions similar to the Naukratis vessels are far more common than Attic (or any) imports throughout this region (Berenice: Riley 1979: nos. 684-86, fig. 113; Alexandria: Adriani 1940: fig. 53.3, 18; Adriani 1952b: fig. 70.17; Coptos: personal study; Ashdod: Dothan 1971: fig. 9.5, 6; Samaria: Reisner, Fischer, and Lyon 1924: fig. 178.5, 9-12; Zayadin 1966: pl. 31.94; Hennessy 1970: fig. 9.23; Tarsus: Jones 1950: fig. 135.237,239). One unguentarium fragment found in Kom Ge'if NW 2A differs in form and fabric: it has a wide disc foot and is made of desert marl. It is similar to a late-second-century Phoenician type, the pared fusiform unguentarium. The Phoenician vessels are distinguished by their abbreviated spindles, flaring disc feet and careful horizontal paring around the lower body (Berlin 1997: 65, PW 94-98, pls. 13, 75). The Naukratis unguentarium shares the first two characteristics, though its fabric identifies it as Egyp? tian. No other examples have been published from Egyptian sites. fugs At least eight distinct forms of jug were found at Naukratis. Most are made of Delta silt and many are slipped. Besides these local productions, there are also ten fragments of desert marl and three</page><page sequence="55">1998 A Ceramic Typology for Hellenistic Lower Egypt 39 of the smooth, pinkish white clay of Aswan. Six Aegean lagynoi were also found. These last are proba? bly the only vessels acquired for their contents, since none of the other jug forms are compatible with long-distance trade, all having a wide mouth that can not be stoppered easily. The earliest and most common form found at Naukratis is the long-necked delta rim jug (figs. 2.36, 2.37:1-14), which first appears at Kom Ge'if in NW IC and so dates to the early third century B.C. Thirty-three fragments were found at Kom Hadid and fourteen at Kom Ge'if. The form is quite sim? ple: a fairly wide mouth (between 10-15 cm), an elongated, cylindrical neck, and a long, sturdy vertical strap handle from mid neck to shoulder. The rim is thickened and slightly pulled out, resulting in a profile ranging from rounded to triangular (the latter resembling the Greek A, hence the name). Three of the Naukratis vessels are of Upper Egyptian desert marl and the remainder are of the local silt; about half of the silt jugs are slipped. This form was manufactured at the nearby kiln at Kom Dahab, as evidenced by numerous wasters recovered by the survey team (Coulson and Leonard 1983: 68 and fig. 4B). Similar-looking jugs occur elsewhere in Egypt and the southeastern Mediterranean (and far- ther afield as well), though it is difficult to assess the various stylistic and chronological relationships of such basic and simple vessels. A second type of jug found at Naukratis is the folded rim jug (fig. 2.38:1-4). Only four fragments appear at Kom Hadid, and two at Kom Ge'if; the type first appears at Kom Ge'if in NW 2B, dating to the third century B.C. AU examples are in Upper Egyptian desert marl. This type is the standard early Hellenistic jug at Coptos (personal study), though it is unparalleled outside Egypt. Its appearance at Naukratis reflects some traffic between Upper and Lower Egypt during the third century. The third form found is the narrow ledge rim jug (fig. 2.38:5-15). Examples occur in the local Delta silt, both plain and slipped (nineteen at Kom Hadid and nine at Kom Ge'if), in Upper Egyptian desert marl (one each at Kom Hadid and Kom Ge'if), and in the distinctive soft marl of Aswan (one each at Kom Hadid and Kom Ge'if). Delta silt and desert marl fragments appear at Kom Ge'if in NW 2B and in Aswan marl a century later, in NW 4B. Like the delta rim jug, the narrow ledge rim jug was also manufactured at Kom Dahab (Coulson and Leonard 1983: 68, figs. 4C, D). These jugs have a strongly everted, slightly curled rim whose outer face was neatly tooled off (sometimes creating a small flange) and a high arched handle (sometimes made from double coils, sometimes a flattened strap similar to a lagynos). A complete waster from the Kom Dahab kiln shows the handle curving up from the rim and back down to the shoulder, the body rather squat and globular, and the bottom pushed up into a high depression. This form is quite elaborate and is probably copied from metal examples. A popular and more costly original is also indicated by the variety of ceramic versions, from both Upper and Lower Egypt. Precise parallels for both the desert marl and Aswan productions occur at Coptos, both in third century levels (personal study). A fourth form is the rolled rim jug (fig. 2.38:16-19). This is a rather fancy form: the rim curves around into a pronounced roll and a narrow ridge encircles the middle of the neck. Five fragments were found at Kom Hadid and two at Kom Ge'if, first appearing at the latter mound in NW 6B. Six of these rolled rim jugs are made of the local silt and one is of Aswan marl. It is interesting to note that all three Aswan vessels found at Naukratis occur in later Hellenistic levels. At Coptos, Aswan rolled rim jugs occur in stratified deposits of the late third century (personal study). Early Hellenistic trade between Upper and Lower Egypt is reflected by the appearance of Upper Egyptian marl folded rim jugs at Kom Ge'if in NW 2B; these later Hellenistic Aswan jugs indicate the continuation of this activity. A couple jug fragments found at Naukratis may be long necked square rim jugs (fig. 2.39: 15, 16?). The form is difficult to distinguish in drawings from messy versions of delta rim or narrow ledge rim</page><page sequence="56">40 Andrea M. Berlin AASOR 55 jugs. One probable example in silt appears at Kom Ge'if in NW 2B, while a marl version was found in NW Hiatus A. Both vessels are quite similar to a type of Upper Egyptian marl jug found in second- century B.C. levels at Coptos (personal study). A similar jug has also been found at Paphos (Hayes 1991: fig. 16.4). A sixth jug form is the long neck flattened rim jug (fig. 2.39:1-5). A single marl example was found at Kom Ge'if in N1C; six similar fragments found at Kom Hadid are made of the local Delta silt. They have in common a wide, cylindrical neck topped by a flattened, slightly ledge-like rim. A very similar jug, also of Delta silt, with a wide strap handle from mid neck, was found in the early second century levels at Coptos (personal study). Other examples appear at Alexandria (Adriani 1940: fig. 53.14), Maskhuta (Holladay 1982: pl. 30.7), and at Paphos, on Cyprus (Hayes 1991: fig. 16.7). Twelve lagynoi were found at Naukratis: seven at Kom Hadid and five at Kom Ge'if. The lagynos is the most distinctive Hellenistic jug form, having a squat, sometimes biconical body; long, narrow neck; small mouth; and single flat strap handle (fig. 2.39:13, 14). This is the single jug shape that could have been shipped full and without undue spillage, and in fact six of the lagynoi found at Naukratis were Aegean imports (on this fabric and its probable southwestern Aegean origins, see Hayes 1991: 19, Lagynos series 3). The other six lagynoi were of the local silt and might have been manufactured at Kom Dahab, where a single intact but fire-cracked lagynos was recovered from the kiln debris (Coul? son and Leonard 1983: 68-9, fig. 4A). At Naukratis, both the local and the imported lagynoi occur in early Hellenistic contexts (Kom Ge'if NW 2B and 3B, respectively). Their absence from the later Hel? lenistic phases is odd; at this time the shape became increasingly popular throughout the southeastern Mediterranean (Berlin 1997: 47-49). But this should probably be taken as a further reflection of the rural, and reduced, status of the Naukratis community. The final form identified here is the flanged rim jug (fig. 2.39:6-12). This vessel has a wide neck and mouth, and a rim with a rather thick ridge, or flange, jutting out beneath the lip. Seven fragments were found (seven at Kom Hadid, two at Kom Ge'if), though none in a stratified Hellenistic deposit. All are in the local silt; four are slipped as well. No Egyptian parallels are known to me; the form is very close to a Phoenician table amphora variation made in the early first century B.C (Berlin 1997: 39, PW 6-7, pl. 1). The Naukratis fragments may derive from small table amphorae as well; both they and the better-preserved Phoenician vessels have rim diameters between 10 and 12 cm. Hydriae/Table Amphorae The fragments included here share the characteristics of a very wide, flanged rim (15-18 cm) and broad, cylindrical neck (fig. 2.40). None have preserved handles. They are similar in form to both the narrow ledge rim jugs (see above) and the overhanging rim kraters (see below), but are midway between these shapes in size. They are consistent in both form and size with hydriae and table ampho? rae. Both shapes are reasonably common in Egypt and elsewhere in the southeastern Mediterranean, though for quite different purposes. Hydriae, such as the famous ones found in Alexandrian ceme? teries, were used for cinerary urns, while table amphorae were used during meals for mixed wine. All of these vessels were generally highly decorated with slip, additional paint, incision, and sometimes pieces of clay, coiled or molded (Adriani 1940: fig. 48.1, 2, pls. 47, 48.5, 7; Adriani 1952: figs. 13, 16).17 At Kom Ge'if these fragments first appear in NW Hiatus A, which dates to the late second century B.C A total of thirty were found: twenty-two at Kom Hadid and eight at Kom Ge'if. One of the Kom Hadid rims is an import (fig. 2.40:1); the rest are made of the local Delta silt. The imported rim, and most of the silt rims, have a thin slip smoothed over the rim and interior mouth. The shape of the</page><page sequence="57">1998 A Ceramic Typology for Hellenistic Lower Egypt 41 Naukratis fragments is especially close to a second century B.C. West Slope table amphora from Paphos, identified as a product of Pergamon (Hayes 1991: fig. 4.1). Kraters and Dinoi Kraters and dinoi are both broad, deep vessels, with two or more handles. Though none of the Naukratis examples are well enough preserved, comparanda indicates that both forms were footed, and so could stand. Both shapes were clearly designed as large mixing bowls, for either wet or dry goods. They are distinguished from one another, however, by a specific formal characteristic: on kraters, the body wall curves in below the rim, while on dinoi, the body wall angles out. This formal distinction may have had practical consequences. The more open profile of the krater is well-suited for pouring or ladling. The rim of a dinos, on the other hand, has an inturned ledge that would make pouring an espe? cially messy operation. It may be, therefore, that kraters were used as part of a table service, while dinoi were kept in the kitchen. There are few kraters found in the early Hellenistic phases at Naukratis; the ones that do appear are made of desert marl and so are of Upper Egyptian manufacture. These are short squared rim kraters?simple, broad vessels with a short, thick, squared-off ledge rim (fig. 2.432-4, 6-8). Six were found at Kom Hadid and four at Kom Ge'if, beginning in NW 2B. Identical kraters, also of desert marl, appear at Coptos in the earliest Hellenistic levels (personal study), and very similar vessels were found at Berenice as well (Riley 1979: 279, nos. 594, 596, fig. 109). The overhanging rim krater first appears at Kom Ge'if in NW 4B. This form's distinguishing feature is a wide, arcing rim, whose lip is either tooled off with a small flange or worked into a pinched pie-crust design (figs. 2.44, 2.45). Two (or more?) horizontal coil handles sit on the shoulder. This is by far the most common krater form found at Naukratis: thirty-nine fragments come from Kom Hadid and six from Kom Ge'if. Examples first appear at Kom Ge'if in NW 4B. This second century date is consistent with finds elsewhere in Egypt, as seen by dated parallels from Maskhuta (Holladay 1982: pl. 28.18), Tell el-Herr (Gratien and Soulie 1988: fig. 3.d), and Coptos (personal study). In the second and first centuries B.C. the form appears throughout the eastern Mediterranean in various fabrics, most presumably local: Sabratha (Dore 1989: type 213, fig. 52), Berenice (Riley 1979: nos. 801-809, fig. 120; at these north African sites the form appears only in the late first century B.C. and is most abundant in the following century), Samaria (Reisner, Fischer, and Lyon 1924: fig. 184.31a), Tel Anafa (Berlin 1997: 135-36, PW 393-99, pls. 42, 83), Paphos (Hayes 1991: fig. 56.20), Tarsus (Jones 1950: fig. 190.H), Corinth (Williams 1978: no. 8, pl. 23), and Athens (Thompson 1934: D33, fig. 62; D67, figs. 76, 122). The Naukratis vessels, too, are local; all are in Delta silt and two-thirds of these are slipped as well. Like the other second century silt forms found at Naukratis, no examples were found from Kom Dahab, so the precise origin is unknown. Two other krater forms were found only at Kom Hadid. The first is, as far as I know, unique to Naukratis; the excavators named it a "nailhead" rim krater (fig. 2.46). This vessel has a wide mouth, angled rim, and thickened, half-rounded lip, which provides its unusual profile. Only six such vessels were found, all made of Delta silt. All are slipped as well. The final krater form is here called a necked krater; this has a short straight neck, topped by a thick ledge rim (fig. 2.47). Horizontal coil handles are attached to the upper shoulder. In some cases these are short and flattened against the wall; in others they are long, and pulled up and over the rim. Five necked kraters were found, all made of Delta silt and covered with a fugitive white slip. Very similar forms were found at Saqqarah (Giddy, Smith, and French 1992: pl. 61.6, 7, found in topsoil) and</page><page sequence="58">42 Andrea M. Berlin AASOR 55 Paphos (Hayes 1991, fig. 60.20.7, from a first century B.C deposit that also contained early Ptolemaic coins, and perhaps earlier pottery as well). A single example of this krater form was found at Coptos in a mid/late third century B.C. deposit (personal study). Two forms of dinoi were found at Naukratis. The earlier, and more common, is the ledge rim dinos (fig. 2.48). On this form the upper body wall curves inward, so that the mouth is somewhat constricted, then turns out into a wide, slightly thickened ledge rim. Fragments of twenty-two ledge rim dinoi were found at Kom Hadid, and three at Kom Ge'if, beginning in NW 2B. All are in Delta silt; eleven are slipped as well. The identical form appears at Coptos in the early Hellenistic period; all examples at that site are in desert marl (personal study). Similar vessels, but glazed, are known from Samaria (Crowfoot, Crowfoot, and Kenyon 1957: fig. 57:5-8) and Knossos (Callaghan 1981: no. 45, fig. 8). The second dinos form found at Naukratis is the thickened rim dinos (fig. 2.49). Most examples are wider than ledge rim dinoi, from which they are distinguished by a thick, almost triangular, rim that juts over both the mouth and the body wall. Thirteen fragments were found: one at Kom Ge'if in NW 7B and the remainder at Kom Hadid. One is desert marl, the rest Nile silt; half are slipped. Thick? ened rim dinoi are more confined in distribution than ledge rim dinoi; similar vessels have been found only in Egypt, at Tell el-Herr (Gratien and Soulie 1988: fig. 2b, in silt) and Coptos (beginning in late third century B.C levels, all examples made of desert marl [personal study]). Jars "Jar" is an unwieldly category. Since the name does not encompass a single closely defined form or function, it is a catchall for a wide variety of shapes, both large and small. The one characteristic that all jars have in common is that they are closed vessels, which makes them appropriate as containers, for wet or dry goods. Some jars have more specific designations. The most obvious examples are ampho? rae, which are generally thought of as long-distance transport vessels, mostly for wine and oil (these are treated separately, below). But many other vessels may be considered jars, and in fact many of the vessels found at Kom Ge'if are so identified. Few of these so-called jars appear at Kom Hadid, so these identifications are a kind of default: without more complete examples or parallels, I do not know exactly what vessel the fragment represents. Examples of three recognizable jar forms were found at Kom Hadid and Kom Ge'if, small and large holemouth jars, and a pithos. Small holemouth jars have a thin rounded rim, a narrow mouth (8-12 cm in diameter), and a piri? form body (fig. 2.50: 9-14). Six fragments were found at Kom Hadid and four at Kom Ge'if, beginning in NW 4B. All are made of the local silt, and all are slipped as well. I do know of no parallels for this form from Hellenistic contexts. Large holemouth jars have an elongated piriform body with the upper wall constricting towards the mouth; the rim is simply the slightly thickened terminus of the wall (fig. 2.50:1-8). Two wide vertical strap handles drop from the rim, or immediately below, to the shoulder. Fragments of eight were found at Kom Hadid, and four at Kom Ge'if. They do not appear at the latter mound until NW Hiatus C, which dates to the early first century B.C. One of these large holemouth jars is handmade, the others turned on the wheel; all are in the local silt. This form is similar to early Hellenistic Punic amphorae, but the correspondence is probably accidental; the amphorae' handles are different in form and placement, and of course, Punic amphorae are not made of Delta silt. I can find no similar vessels from other Hellenistic sites. A single pithos rim was found at Kom Ge'if in NW Hiatus C (Berlin in Leonard 1997: fig. 6.36: 4). The vessel was handmade of the local silt. The wide, thick, ledge rim is recognizable because most pithoi have similar rims, which are designed to provide a solid resting place for a lid?an important</page><page sequence="59">1998 A Ceramic Typology for Hellenistic Lower Egypt 43 aspect on a vessel used for long-term dry storage (e.g. pithoi from Athens [Thompson 1934: 69, fig. 54]) and Tel Anafa [Berlin 1997: 156, PW 484-87, pls. 58, 89, 90]). This is the only such vessel found at Naukratis, and I can find no parallels from other Hellenistic Egyptian sites. Stands Stands are a standard item in the Egyptian ceramic corpus. Both small and large examples are found in Dynastic contexts (Hope 1987: figs. 38, 41, 46, 55) and the form continued to be produced in Hellenistic (and Roman) times (Mond and Meyers 1934: shapes 57, 58, 63; figs. 140, 141). At Naukratis, the bottom portions of thirteen stands were found, all at Kom Hadid. They are low stands with thick walls and a plainly finished foot (fig. 2.51:1-13). All are in Delta silt; most are slipped. Similar stands appear in Hellenistic deposits at Coptos (made of desert marl [personal study]), at the Bucheum (Mond and Meyers 1934: type 58R), and at Maskhuta (Holladay 1982: pl. 29.10). The Naukratis stands, as well as the other Hellenistic Egyptian examples, were probably used to support amphorae or round-bottom jars (such as fig. 2.51:16); the absence of burning on any of the fragments argues against kitchen use. Despite their apparent utility, however, there is quite a discrepancy between the quantities of amphorae and stands found at Naukratis: one hundred seven amphorae (fifty-seven local rim fragments, seven imported rims, and forty-three imported stamped handles) vs. thirteen stands (but see "deep basins" below). This is probably because, in most cases, amphorae were simply leaned up against a wall, with their toes worked into the dirt floor. Stands were necessary only when an amphora was placed on a paved, or overly hard-packed surface. In the rooms excavated at Kom Ge'if, dirt floors were the norm; no paved surfaces were encountered in situ (cf. chapter 3). Basins Two forms of handmade silt vessels were found at Naukratis. The first are here defined as shallow basins (figs. 2.52:1-6, 2.53:1-8). These vessels are very wide, with a short, thick, vertical upper wall and a slightly thickened ledge or triangular-shaped rim. The lower wall (or vessel floor?) turns inward sharply, but none are preserved below this point. A single fragment was found at Kom Ge'if in NW 2B; fourteen were found at Kom Hadid. Similar low, wide, handmade vessels, also with a short, vertical wall/rim were found at Coptos, beginning in the early Hellenistic period (personal study). The Coptos vessels have been identified provisionally as bread discs or molds, based on their correspondence?in size as well as form?to the bread discs still used in Upper Egypt today. This shape is traditional to Upper Egypt only; the bread that is baked there is called "sun bread" because it rises outdoors, resting on these discs in the full sun. The Naukratis vessels may have been bread discs as well, or even lids for storage vessels (such as the deep basins, pithos, or holemouth jars). The vessels here defined as deep basins are all handmade of Delta silt (figs. 2.54, 2.55). Most have a simple vertical wall and or slightly thickened rim; on some the rim is pulled out into a rounded or triangular lip, and on others the wall constricts inward below the rim. Twelve such rim fragments were found at Kom Hadid, along with four fairly narrow, thick, flat bottoms; no such vessels were found at Kom Ge'if. These deep-bodied fragments may have functioned as some kind of receptacle. The upper body fragments, especially those whose walls constrict, are very similar to the basins of late Hellenistic braziers (such as those found at Paphos [Hayes 1991: 77, no. 24, pl. 18.11, 12]), though the absence of burning argues against such a use. A very suggestive modern parallel is provided by vessels used in the Delta as water jar supports; they are identical to both the upper and lower Naukratis fragments in scale and form (Heinein 1992: 18, no. 18B). Such a use for these "deep basins" could account for some of the numerical discrepancy between jars and stands noted above.</page><page sequence="60">44 Andrea M. Berlin AASOR 55 Amphorae In the Hellenistic period, amphorae were the vessel of choice for transporting and storing liquids? primarily wine and oil. This heavy-duty function required careful manufacture: transport amphorae typically have neat, evenly formed rims for holding a stopper in place; well-attached, easy-to-grasp handles; and fairly thick, consistently fired walls. These characteristics made amphorae among the most durable of ancient containers, which in turn allowed for many cycles of reuse. In Egypt, espe? cially, finds of imported amphorae may be suspected of representing not the initial, happy acquisition of finer vintages, but the secondary, mundane function of potable water storage. Fragments of one hundred seven Hellenistic amphorae were found at Naukratis, a figure that includes forty-three stamped handles published previously (see above). The amphorae are a diverse group, com? prising four types made in Egypt, along with vessels from Rhodes, Kos, Knidos, Samos, Chios, Thasos, and the Italian peninsula. Here I do discuss only the non-stamped fragments that are of Egyptian manu? facture. Beaded rim amphorae (fig. 2.56:1, 2) are characterized by an evenly cylindrical neck topped by a narrow rounded rim providing a beaded profile. At Naukratis, two fabrics occur: the local Delta silt and a gritty, lime-tempered, dirty-white calcareous fabric. The calcareous type is much more common: nineteen fragments were found, fourteen at Kom Hadid and five at Kom Ge'if. The type first appears at Kom Ge'if in NW 2B. Only three silt vessels occur, two at Kom Hadid and one in NW 2B at Kom Ge'if. The silt vessels are all covered with a thin, pale slip, which may have been intended to mimic the white surface of the calcareous type. Silt beaded rim amphorae were made at Kom Dahab, whence the Naukratis vessels surely derive (wasters there also are white-slipped). The calcareous vessels may be from the region of Aswan (J. Hayes, personal communication). Certainly the form is very common in Upper Egypt, appearing at Coptos beginning in the late third century B.C. (personal study), the Bucheum (Mond and Meyers 1934: pls. 147, 148, types 88d, 88g), Karnak (Jacquet-Gordon n.d.: nos. 35, 57, 267, 620), Elephantine (Gempeler 1992: pl. 127, nos. 9-10, fig. K754), and in and around the Red Sea port of Berenice (J. Hayes, personal communication). This beaded rim form is a popular one for locally made amphorae of the Hellenistic period, not only in Egypt, but at Berenice in North Africa (Riley 1979: Hellenistic amphora 1, fig. 68) and at Paphos (Hayes 1991: 86, fig. 37.1-9, nos. 16-20). All of these versions are essentially similar to, and probably based on, the widely distributed Rhodian and/or Koan amphorae. The second amphora form found at Naukratis, the squared rim amphora (figs. 2.56:3-8, 2.57:4,5), occurs only in Delta silt. On this form the rim is slightly wider than the neck, and has a square or rect? angular profile, usually demarcated by a narrow groove. This is the single most common type: thirteen fragments were found at Kom Hadid and thirteen at Kom Ge'if, beginning at the latter mound in NW 3A. Examples of this form, all in silt, occur in early and mid second century B.C. contexts in the Delta at Maskhuta (Holladay 1982, pl. 33.13) and Tell Timai (Ochsenschlager 1967, fig. 9), as well as in a late third century B.C. context in Upper Egypt, at Coptos (personal study) and in a late second century B.C. context at Paphos (Hayes 1991: 87, Amphora list no. 27, pl. 22.2, fig. 47, Amphora list no. 28, fig. 73.4). All of the squared rim amphorae found at Naukratis were probably made at Kom Dahab; this is the likely source for those from Paphos and other Delta sites as well. Unlike the widely copied beaded rim form, squared rim amphorae are confined in distribution. The form is likely original with Hellenistic Egyptian potters. Beaded and squared rim amphorae were used at Naukratis throughout the third and second centu? ries B.C Two new silt forms appear in first century B.c deposits. The more common are inthickened</page><page sequence="61">1998 A Ceramic Typology for Hellenistic Lower Egypt 45 Table 2.5.

Ell.124.10, E11.69 rim amphorae (fig. 2.57:1-3). Nine were found: three at Kom Hadid, the rest at Kom Ge'if, beginning in NW Hiatus C. This form is similar to, and probably a development of, the squared rim type; it is distinguished by an inset, or groove, on the top of the rim, creating a small inward thickened flange. The Naukratis inthickened rim amphorae are similar to the second (later) form made at Tell el-Haraby, on the coast west of Alexandria, production of which may have begun in the later Ptolemaic period (Majcherek and Shennawi 1991: fig. IB. Dating is hampered by the lack of recorded examples at other Egyptian sites; I do speculate a beginning in the first century B.C, possibly continuing into the first or second century A.D.). The form also appears in first century B.C contexts at Coptos (personal study) and at Quseir al-Qadim on the Red Sea coast (Whitcomb and Johnson 1979: 23p; Whitcomb and Johnson 1982: I4g). Outside of Egypt, similar vessels occur only in North Africa, at Berenice, in late first century A.D. deposits (Riley 1979: 169-70, Early Roman amphora 13, no. 172, fig. 78). These are questioned as local, and they may have been imports from Egypt. The final silt amphora form found at Naukratis is the concave rim amphora (fig. 2.57: 6-8). Three fragments come from Kom Ge'if, all in a NW Hiatus C deposit. Examples of this form have been found in Alexandria (Majcherek 1992: fig. 1.4, considered a local variant of the Dressel Ic), Quseir al-Qadim (Whitcomb and Johnson 1979: pls. 21.z, 22.e), Abu Rihal, on the Red Sea coast near Berenice (J. Hayes, personal communication), and Coptos (personal study), all from contexts dated to the late first century B.C and first century A.D. A possible single example was found at Paphos (Hayes 1991, fig. 38.14). No production sites have been found. A Note on the Kom Dahab Kiln Many of the forms found at Kom Hadid and Kom Ge'if have parallels in kiln wasters found in and around the kiln at nearby Kom Dahab (see Table 2.5; Coulson and Leonard 1983: 66-70 and figs. 4-5; Coulson and Wilkie 1986: 65-73). All of these comparable fragments, from both Kom Dahab and the two Naukratis mounds, were manufactured of the local Delta silt. The proximity of the sites, along with the consistency of vessel form and fabric, support the hypothesis that the Kom Dahab potters supplied the settlement at Naukratis. When the Kom Dahab kiln was discovered, the excavators could adduce no firm date for its use, since none of the forms were known from stratified</page><page sequence="62">46 Andrea M. Berlin AASOR 55 and datable contexts. A single coin of Ptolemy X (beginning of the first century B.C.) from the accu? mulated debris within the collapsed main chamber provided only a terminus ante quem. Using this as a guide, along with an intact, small lagynos?a ceramic form invented sometime during the third cen? tury B.C. and quite popular throughout the second and first centuries as well?the excavators sur- mised that the kiln operated during the latter part of the Ptolemaic period (Coulson and Leonard 1983: 69). In a later article (Coulson and Wilkie 1986: 70) the excavators noted again that the debris represented the time when the kiln was already being used as a dump and that its original use dates could well be earlier. Now, with the identification of Kom Dahab vessels in the stratified deposits of Kom Ge'if, the kiln's periods of production can be identified. The Naukratis data help to pinpoint both the beginning and the possible end of production at Kom Dahab. Every single Kom Dahab form found at Kom Ge'if occurs there in early Hellenistic deposits (see table 2.5). Therefore, the Kom Dahab kiln must have begun in, and continued to operate through, the third century B.C. In the second century many new silt shapes appear at Kom Ge'if, but not a single fragment of any of these was recovered from Kom Dahab. This does not prove that pro? duction there ceased; the Kom Dahab potters may have continued to make only the same eight forms as before. It does, however, indicate that in the second century at least one other pottery manufactory began production, and that this as-yet-unidentified center also supplied the Naukratis community. This new center must be in addition to the second century workshops at Tell el-Fara'in, since none of the Naukratis silt forms of that period were found there either. No large serving or mixing vessels seem to have been made at any of the production centers yet isolated. Among the shapes in Delta silt that are found at Naukratis, but are unattested at either Kom Dahab or Tell el-Fara'in are hydriae/table amphorae, kraters (all types), and dinoi (all types). While narrow specialization among rural pottery producers is rare (either in antiquity or in more recent times), some degree of compartmentalization is not. So, for example, the Tell el-Fara'in workshops made a variety of table vessels, but no cooking vessels. A similar situation is attested from northern Israel during early and middle Roman times, where two major pottery production centers have been isolated: Kfar Hananiah and Shikhin. The former primarily made cooking vessels of various shapes along with some jugs; the latter made large storage jars, kraters, and lamps (Adan-Bayewitz 1993; Adan-Bayewitz and Perlman 1990). Similar patterns have been noted for early/mid twentieth century Morocco (Vossen 1984: 366-67), for southern Arabia in the 1950s (Tufnell 1961), and for modern Egypt (Nicholson and Patterson 1985). Between the third century workshops at Kom Dahab, the second century workshops at Tell el- Fara'in, and other second century workshops, Delta potters made vessels for most basic needs: for table use, including both serving and eating, for cooking, and for storage. It was the Kom Dahab potters, however, who seem to have supplied the bulk of the pottery used at Naukratis. Within each general shape category found at the site, the Kom Dahab versions are the most common ones. The Naukratis residents' dependence on this close local supply further underscores the rural and largely isolated nature of their settlement.</page><page sequence="63">Table 2.6.

Berlin AASOR 55 Notes The present volume concentrates on the finds from Kom Hadid, but there are a few exceptions: Some of the terra nigra vessels and imported amphorae were actually found at Kom Ge'if. It was originally planned that because the two types were the exception at Kom Ge'if, but the norm at Kom Hadid, they should be illustrated as a unit and this is how the plates were assembled. Fabric descriptions of the individual pieces are given in the captions for the illustrations. Fabric types, consisting mainly of "local" Delta silts and (Upper Egyptian?) desert marls, are presented in Appendix 1. In the field, lamps, imported amphorae, faience and metal objects were registered as separate objects of mate? rial culture. A discussion of these items is included in Chapter 3. See, for example, this shape in Nile silt (Bourriau 1981: no. 129) dated to early Dynasty XI. Several examples in coarse red marl appear in the Middle Kingdom levels at Coptos (personal study). Via variants produced in Italy, such as Lamboglia form 55 in Campana A, it was also widely distributed through the west in the second century B.C. (Kenrick 1985: 16). 5An extremely abbreviated sampling of parallels from the larger region includes (moving from west to east): Sabratha (Dore 1989: 172-73, type 147, fig. 45), Berenice (Riley 1979: nos. 609-614, fig. 110), Alexandria (Adriani 1940: figs. 40.1, 4, 6, 53.55, 63, 64), Maskhuta (Holladay 1982: pl. 28.9-13), Ashdod (Dothan 1971: fig. 15.20), Samaria (Crowfoot, Crow? foot, and Kenyon 1957, fig. 49), Paphos (Hayes 1991: fig. 13.1-9), and Tarsus (Jones 1950: figs. 121.51, 64, 122.57, 70,71, 80, 180.51-80, A-N). A short list of parallels includes Berenice (Riley 1979: nos. 607, 608, fig. 110), Alexandria (Adriani 1940: fig. 40.3; Adriani 1952b: fig. 70.25), Paphos (Hayes 1991: figs. 5.9- 10), and Tarsus (Jones 1950: figs. 121.42, 179.41, 42, H). Hayes 1991: 23-24 gives a roundup of find-spots and discussion of dating (Ware A). To his long list add Berenice (Riley 1979: nos. 602-5, fig. 109; these are local versions), Alexandria (Adriani 1940: figs. 53.57, 58; Adriani 1952b, fig. 70.24), Coptos (personal study), and Ashdod (Dothan 1971: figs. 9.15, 10.15). Black-glazed versions have been found at Samaria (Crow? foot, Crowfoot, and Kenyon 1957: fig. 53.2), Tarsus (Jones 1950: fig. 181D), and Athens (Rotroff 1997: 109-10, nos. 328-30, fig. 20). The Athenian vessels are the most closely dated, having been found in a workshop dump of the first quarter ofthe second century B.C. (Rotroff 1997: 110). A sin? gle example was found at Berenice (Riley 1979: no. 649, fig. 111, identified as local production). For ESA versions see Hayes 1986: 22, form 18, pl. 3.5. The earliest examples I can find come from the foun? dation deposit of Amosis II (569-527 B.c.) at Nebesheh (Kelley 1976: pl. 86.2.25). Nothing of this sort is pictured in the standard references to Dynastic period pottery, such as Hope 1987. A single example of a "deep casserole/pan" from Sa- bratha was found in a context that may date as early as the fourth century B.C. (Dore 1989: 113, fig. 27.30.30, type 27). The Berenice vessels are called "predominately early Hellenistic" (Riley 1979: 243), but on no apparent evidence; the only parallels cited are the Corinthian vessels, which themselves date from the mid-second century B.C. The form is classified by Hayes as a frying pan of form Knossos I = Miletos 30 (1983: 105-8, figs. 5-7, 9). Though this Hellenistic form is similar to early/mid-Roman period frying pans in shape, it lacks that vessel's distinctive (and use- ful) horizontal coiled handle. Examples are infrequently burned on the bottom, and they are more likely to have been used inside an oven rather than over one. Other Hellenistic micaceous baking dishes have been found at Athens (Thomp? son 1934: E139, fig. 105), Corinth (Wright 1980: pl. 31.77; Slane 1986: fig. 15.91), Tarsus (Jones 1950: figs. 191.F, 201.E), Paphos (Hayes 1991: figs. 28.1 bottom, 32.7, 34.99), Tel Anafa (Berlin 1997: 110-11, PW 298-301, pls. 34, 81), Akko-Ptolemais (Dothan 1976: fig. 45.9), Tel Michal (Fischer 1989: fig. 13.3.27), Samaria (Crowfoot, Crowfoot, and Ken? yon 1957: fig. 41.23), and Ashdod (Dothan 1971: fig. 24.6). Seven handles are of unknown origin and nineteen undated; these are not included in Table 2.3. Jugs are among the most difficult forms to identify con- fidently, even when one is handling the actual fragments. Be? cause jugs tend to be relatively thin walled, they break into small pieces. This makes it difficult to estimate rim diameter, a crucial measurement for distinguishing jugs from forms with similar rims, such as jars and cooking pots. Moreover, it is rare to have enough preserved to count handles, so even when the diameter is knowable, it is hard to distinguish be? tween jugs and jars. Finally, there are no standard, widely published forms as there are, for example, for table and cooking vessels. This last feature especially compounds the identification dirficulties of the present project, in which I do work solely with field drawings and fabric descriptions. Since jugs are particularly problematic, I have been cautious in identifying this shape, and here discuss only fragments with both shape and fabric parallels. Many more jugs were proba? bly found at Naukratis than are included in this section. 5See examples from Paphos (Hayes 1991: fig. 16.5), Ash? dod (Dothan 1971: fig. 11.1, pl. XIV.l 1), Maskhuta (Holladay 1982: pl. 30.11), Coptos (personal study), Berenice (Riley 1979: no. 1100, fig. 135; this is called a "coarse hydria" and has the requisite horizontal handle, which some of the Nau? kratis examples may have had as well), and Sabratha (Dore 1989: type 395, fig. 69, beginning of third century B.C.). The form is startlingly similar to the common water pitcher found</page><page sequence="65">1998 A Ceramic Typology for Hellenistic Lower Egypt 49 in Hellenistic Athens (Thompson 1934: 464-65, A53-55, B39, figs. 8, 23). At Coptos, a single imported flanged rim hydria, pos? sibly of Rhodian manufacture, was found in an early second century deposit, and a number of very similar vessels made from Upper Egyptian desert marl were found in deposits dat? ing from the mid second through the early first centuries B.C. (personal study). Other similar vessels were found at Pa? phos (Hayes 1991: fig. 41.31) and Sabratha (Dore 1989: type 219, fig. 52). For Alexandrian hydriae, see following note. Several fabrics and production sites have been defined for the hydriae found in the necropoli of Alexandria. On the Cretan white ground series, see Callaghan and Jones 1985: 1? 2 and Enklaar 1985: figs. la-e. On the Rhodian variant, see Callaghan and Jones 1985: 2. On the Alexandrian clay ground type, see Callaghan and Jones 1985: 1-2 and references there. This is Cintas type 315/Carthage Early Amphora 1/ Berenice Hellenistic amphora 10. It is common at Carthage in the fourth and third centuries B.C. (Hayes 1976a: El, 112), and in Hellenistic deposits at Berenice (Riley 1979: 136) and Sabratha (Fulford 1986: no. 77, fig 86; Keay 1989, type 3e, fig. 4.35-37). This rim is similar to a locally made dolium found at Berenice (Riley 1979: no. 751, fig. 118); the vessel is there dated Late Roman, though Riley admits that the form is com? mon in other periods, and that "no satisfactory typological sequence could be established" (p. 317). The locus classicus for this is the observation by He? rodotus (Hist. 3.6) that amphorae imported to Egypt were frequently saved and reused as water jars. Other citations, contemporary with this period, occur in the Zenon papyri, which mention various reuses of Milesian, Samian, Lesbian, and Chian jars (Tcherikower 1937: 76-77, n. 23). The vast quantities of imported Hellenistic amphora handles from Al? exandria have been taken as material evidence for the jars' re- use there (Fraser 1972:1, 161, 165-68). Grace (1962: 107-8) interpreted the nine Hellenistic Rhodian and Knidian han? dles found at the desert site of Nessana (on the border between the Sinai peninsula and the Negev of Israel) as jars reused for water (as suggested by Herodotus). Not having seen the material firsthand, I will confine my discussion only to forms that are obviously Egyptian. Ampho? rae are most reliably identified via stamped handles, and see- ondarily by visual inspection of vessel fabric and form. It is now apparent that many locales produced their own versions of some widely distributed types, making positive identifica? tions of unstamped, fragmentary pieces difficult (see, for ex? ample, probable and possible local versions of Knidian, Rhodian, Chian, and Koan amphorae from Paphos [Hayes 1991: 85-86, Amphora list nos. 1-7, 8-13, 14-15, 16-20, respectively]). I identify these vessels as calcareous beaded rim ampho? rae with some hesitation. The fabric is not dissimilar to that of some Aegean island productions, and the form is close as well. Some of the Naukratis vessels may in fact be Rhodian imports. However, during the excavations at Naukratis, the excavators were unaware that a gritty, light-colored amphora fabric of Egyptian origin existed, with the result that they clas- sified all such vessels as imports. I do think it is likely that many of these "imports" were in fact this common Egyptian type. However, since it is impossible on the basis of drawings and fabric identifications made in the field to separate the Egyptian products from the imported ones, I have chosen to regard them as a local group. The form continues to be popular into early Roman times, notably in the manufacture of Dressel 2-4, a Koan im? itation made at several western Mediterranean sites (see recent discussion and bibliography in Keay 1989: 38-39, type 13). Two types of silt amphorae were also produced at Tell el-Haraby, on the Mediterranean coast 173 km west of Alex? andria (Majcherek and Shennawi 1991, figs. IA, B), begin? ning in the late Ptolemaic period. The earlier Tell el-Haraby amphora (Type A, fig. IA) has a somewhat squared-off rim, as the Kom Dahab form, but is distinguished by a slight groove or bevel in the upper surface of the rim. Two of the Kom Hadid silt squared rim amphorae appear similar (figs. 2.57:1, 2.56:8), but it is impossible to assign them to this source without visual inspection. A third squared rim am? phora production site might be postulated based on the finds from Coptos. M. Lawall, who is studying and will publish these amphorae, says that "the fabrics [of ] the Naukratis ex? amples do not lend themselves to a close comparison with the fabrics found at Coptos" (personal communication). However, the absence of squared rim amphorae from other Hellenistic deposits in Upper Egypt might suggest that the Coptos am? phorae came to that site via Nile traffic from Lower Egypt.</page><page sequence="66">50 Andrea M.

(Higgins 1967: 56; 1969: 404). The earliest archaeological evidence for this practice is the series of Daedalic plaques executed in a hybrid style that mixed Rhodian and local Egyptian ele? ments (Higgins 1969: 404, with references). Local production of figurines is considered to have con? tinued at Naukratis during the fifth and fourth centuries B.C, but in the absence of a sizable corpus of well-dated examples, very little can be said about the development of the genre during that period (Higgins 1967: 93). It was after the cosmopolitan city of Alexandria was founded in 331 B.C., how? ever, that the coroplasts' art can be seen to flourish in Egypt (Higgins 1967: 129-33). At first, the immigrant artisans in the new capital were forced to compete for sales with their counterparts at Naukratis. Soon, however, a true Alexandrian school of terracotta figurines developed, one that can be clearly defined by the large number of well-preserved examples from the many cemeteries (Chatby, Hadra) of the ancient city. By 200 B.C, these two cities had lost whatever exclusivity they may have shared, and figurine production became widespread throughout the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, espe? cially at sites around the Fayoum Oasis. These new workshops produced figurines and plaques charac? terized by an eclecticism in which an array of complex and distinctive Graeco-Egyptian religious motives appeared side-by-side with a range of themes and characters drawn from the Greek comic stage.2 Indeed, many of these manufacturing centers continued to be prolific well into the Roman Period. Terracotta masks and figurines were some of the earliest finds at the site of Naukratis, over 400 of them being reported by Gutch (1898/99: 67) from the spring campaign of 1899. Our work at the site, however, was less productive in this regard with less than two dozen fragments being recorded.3 1. Mask fragment. Miniature (pl. 3.1) Locus 6207 N.III.62.19 MC#37 Technique: Moldmade, some handtool finishing. Open back. Fabric: Well-levigated Delta silt. Thick gray core with 7.5YR 4/2 (Weak Red) to 10R 5/8 (Red) sandwich. Surfaces mottled from 10R 5/4 (Weak Red) to gray. Finely ground (sand-sized to 1 mm) white, gray, and red grit temper, as well as micaceous inclusions of similar size, are frequent. Traces of fugitive white paint(?) on exterior. Description: Fragment of mask. Only a portion ofthe forehead and the upper part ofthe eyes/brows remain. Maximum preserved H. 4.9 cm, W. 3.6 cm. Date: 3rd-2nd century B.C. 164</page><page sequence="181">1998 Miscellaneous Material Culture 165 Discussion: Of the masks that Webster sketches to illustrate the various types that were utilized in ancient Greek Comedy (1969b: 13-26), the Naukratis mask comes closest to his Type C (Old Man) and Type GA (Old Man), but neither of these faces is as extremely contorted (note the severe angle ofthe eyes) nor exudes such a demonic feeling as does the Naukratis fragment. Possible Comparanda: Theatrical masks: Petrie 1905: 2, pl. XLIX: 79, from Ehnasya; Goldman 1950: 347, no. 276, fig. 234, from Tarsus; Bell 1981: 221, no. 809, pl. 125, from Morgantina; Breccia 1930: 65, Tav. XXXVII (from Alexandria). 2. Mask fragment. Hair and side of face (pl. 3.2) Locus 6304 N.III.63.09 MC#20 Technique: Moldmade. Open back. After firing, the mask had been pierced through at right (of the now-broken edge) for suspension/use. Fabric: Well-levigated Delta silt. Fabric ranges from 7.5R 5/6 (Red) to 10R 5/4 (Weak Red), with 7.5R 4/2 (Weak Red) core. Finely ground (sand-sized to 1 mm) white, gray, and red grit temper with frequent micaceous inclusions of similar size. Description: Theatrical mask showing hair combed away from the face. White paint or lime encrus- tation on exterior. Maximum preserved H. c. 7.6 cm. W. c. 3.4 cm. Date: 2nd century B.C.(?). Discussion and Possible Comparanda: Two very good parallels, with equally straight hairline and suspension hole at the transition of the hair to the face, can be cited for this piece. One was found at Morgantina, where it was thought to represent one ofthe youths of New Comedy (Bell 1981: 69, 218? 19, nos. 782 and 783, pl. 122); the other is said to have been found in Alexandria (Birmingham Museum 1968: 43, no. 190, pl. 14). A mask, with an equally vertical hairline, appears on a fragment from Tarsus, along with bits of a small pointed ear that led Goldman to suggest that the (unpierced) Tarsus example had been a votive mask dedicated to Dionysos (1950: 347, no. 290, fig. 235). Another fragment from Troy, also similar to the Naukratis fragment, is published as a slave from Greek comedy (Goldman 1950: 347, no. 275, fig. 235). 3. Figurine fragment. Harpocrates (pl. 3.3) Locus 7605 N.III.76.30 MC#62 Technique: Moldmade in three (?) pieces: front, back, and (solid) head. Joined by seams at sides of body. Closed back with traces of very small (c. 1.5 cm) vent at midback. Fabric: Well-levigated Delta silt. 7.5R 5/6 (Red) to 10R 5/4 (Weak Red) fabric, with a 7.5YR 4/2 (Weak Red) core that is mottled to 10R 5/8 (Red). Tempered with finely ground (sand-sized to 1 mm) white, gray, and red grit with frequent micaceous inclusions of similar size. Traces of white paint on face, arm and hair; pink on garment and headdress; and light blue near right ear and left shoulder. Description: Harpocrates, wearing headdress culminating in the Double Crown. Right finger in/at mouth and cornucopia (?) in left arm against shoulder. Only the head and upper torso are preserved which is not sufficient to determine whether the god was standing or seated. Both types are common. Maximum preserved H. 8.0 cm, W. 4.8 cm. Date: 3rd-lst century B.C.(?) Discussion and Possible Comparanda: Harpocrates was the son of Osiris and Isis (with some assis? tance from the magic of Thoth). He is usually shown as a young boy with his hair pulled to the right and worn as a sidelock behind, or covering, the right ear (see #4 below). His youth is further emphasized</page><page sequence="182">166 Albert Leonard, Jr. AASOR 55 by his gesture of placing a finger(s) to or into his mouth. He can be depicted also wearing a variety of headdresses, the most popular being the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt (as shown here) sym- bolizing his dominion over the entire land, and the triple Atef Crown with feathers and discs represent? ing his role as successor to Osiris and emphasizing his solar nature. He was an extremely popular deity among the general population and is shown in combination with a wide range of other gods and icono- graphic paraphernalia, some of which are identifiable and others of which are not (Lurker 1988: 66). Very good parallels for this figurine can be found, inter alia, in: Philipp 1972: 19, Cat. no. 5, Taf. IV (standing); Kaufmann 1915: Taf. 18; Bayer-Niemeyer 1988: 84, no. 68, Taf. 13 (seated), and 118-20, nos. 118-20, Tafs. 22-23 (standing); and possibly Petrie 1905: 2, pl XLVII: 38, 40 (standing); Laumo- nier 1956: 379, no. 1435, pl. 41 (head only); Dunand 1990: 80, no. 160 (standing); and Breccia 1978: 20, pl. V:19 (without crown, from the Hadra cemetery). 4. Figurine head. Harpocrates (pl. 3.4) Locus 7613 N.III.76.70 MC#l46a Technique: Moldmade in bipartite mold: front and back pieces joined at seams behind the ears and sidelock. Fabric: Well-levigated Delta silt. Fabric ranges from 7.5R 5/6 (Red) to 10R 5/4 (Weak Red), over a 7.5YR 4/2 (Weak Red) to 10R 5/8 (Red) core. Temper consists of finely ground (sand-sized to 1 mm) white, gray, and red grit, and frequent micaceous inclusions of similar size. Description: Head of the young god Harpocrates wearing sidelock on the right side of his head. Maximum preserved H. 4.1 cm, W. 4.0 cm. Date: 2nd-lst century B.C Discussion and Possible Comparanda: At first inspection, this figure might appear to represent a comic actor or one ofthe grotesques that abound in Late Hellenistic terracottas and that are especially popular in Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean world (such as the grotesque with greatly exaggerated right ear from first century B.C Smyrna [Bol and Kotera 1986: 182, no. 94]). The presence ofthe sidelock, however, readily identifies the figure as Harpocrates despite the fact that he does not hold his finger(s) to his mouth. Furthermore, he is shown smooth-headed and does not appear to wear one of the distinctive headdresses or crowns with which he is usually depicted. The bits of clay that still adhere to the top ofthe god's head are considered to indicate the lesser quality ofthe piece rather than the remains ofa (broken) lotusbud crown/ Of the figurine fragments published from the earlier Naukratis excavations, three (Gutch 1898/ 99: 90, 93-94 , 136, 142, 210, pls. XII-XIII) are similar to the present piece. For the smoothheaded Harpocrates with pronounced sidelock, cf. Dunand 1990: 117, no. 294; Schiirmann 1989: 284, no. 1072, Taf. 158, (with hand to mouth); Bayer-Niemeyer 1988: 77-78, 234: no. 53-54, 56, 57, Taf. 10:3,4, 11:2; 96:7. Cf. also Harpocrates with sidelock, Petrie 1905:2, pl. XLVIIL56; and the dwarfish Harpocrates, Petrie 1905: 2, and pl LL124. 5* Figurine fragment. Head of Aphrodite(?) wearing a wreath (pl. 3.5) Locus 6203 N.III.62.12 MC#20 Technique: Moldmade. Solid head with hollow, bipartite body. Fabric: Well-levigated Delta silt. Surfaces range from 10YR 6/3 (Pale Red) to 10R 6/2 (Pale Red) with a core mottled between 10R 4/2 (Weak Red) and 5YR 4/6 (Yellowish Red). Tempered with fine (sand-sized to 1 mm) white, gray, and red grit, with frequent micaceous inclusions of similar size.</page><page sequence="183">1998 Miscellaneous Material Culture 167 Description: Head and back of neck preserved. Top of head abraded. Maximum preserved H. c. 5.6 cm, W. c. 4.5 cm. Date: 2nd century B.C. Discussion and Possible Comparanda: With only the head preserved, it is impossible to be certain as to the sex of the individual portrayed or even her/his status as human or divine. Three heads, simi? lar in appearance to the Naukratis head, from Morgantina (Bell 1981: 89-90 nos. 523, 546, and 563) are interpreted as representing the young god Hades on the day of his wedding to Persephone; a youthful (and beardless) Herakles wearing a bound crown with fillet is known from Troy (Thompson 1963: 72, no. 2, with additional notes under no. 3). Thompson published a very similar head from the Kosmos Cistern on the slopes ofthe Aereopagos (Thompson et al. 1987: 355, no. 7[a], pl. 72), which she identified as a young male, whose rather Ptolemaic visage she paralleled with examples from the Chatby cemetery in Alexandria (1987: 355, no. 17, reference to Breccia 1912: 229, 231, pl. LXXIV, nos. 494ff. See also Breccia 1930: 60 [no. 302], Tav. XIX:3). However, on the basis of the comparanda offered below, interpretation as a goddess (preferably Aphrodite or Isis-Aphrodite) wearing a thick, floral wreath (itself an Egyptian custom) is preferred here. Identification as a human, however, is equally possible since, during the Late Hellenistic period, both the wreath and the Knidian coiffure (Thompson 1963: 37-38, 45-48) appeared throughout the Greek world on a wide variety of figure types including men, women, children, and even slaves (Thompson 1963: 46). Chronologically, the popularity of these figurines extends from the fourth through the first centu? ries B.C. (Bell 1981: 66, 76), but this form of the wreath is most popular during the second century B.C. (Thompson 1963: 49-50; Bell 1981: 166), a date to which the Naukratis piece should most probably be assigned. An alternate identification would call attention to the small bits of clay that adhere to the area around the mouth. These could be interpreted as either surplus pieces of clay from the mold that care- lessly had been left on the figurine when it was fired, or as the remains of some attribute of the figure that had disappeared when the figurine was broken. If the latter were to have been the case, the only suitable attribute would be the finger(s) of the young Harpocrates. Not only is this hybrid Egyptian divinity frequently shown making such a gesture, but he can also be depicted wearing a crown that is quite similar to the wreath on the present piece. Arguing against such an interpretation would be the fact that there are many examples of other- wise very carefully crafted figurines that have not been completely cleaned after being removed from the mold, with the resultant bits of surplus clay giving strange or unusual features to the personage represented. Such features, however, appear to have been either unimportant or unnoticed in the ancient marketplace. 6. Figurine. Head of young male (pl. 3.6) Locus 6207 N.III.62.24 MC#48a Technique: Moldmade in bipartite mold. Front and back pieces joined at sides of head. Fabric: Well-levigated Delta silt. Fabric ranges between 5YR 6/3 (Light Reddish Brown) and 5/3 (Reddish Brown) with a gray to 10R 5/8 (Red) core. Tempered with fine (sand-sized to 1 mm) white, gray, and red grit, with frequent micaceous inclusions of similar size. Traces of white and pink paint. Description: Head of young male slightly upturned (and to the right). Broken at neck, only head remains. Chips from top of head missing. Maximum preserved H. 5.9 cm, W. 3.5 cm.</page><page sequence="184">168 Albert Leonard Jr. AASOR 55 Date: 3rd-2nd century B.C.(?). Discussion and Possible Comparanda: The length ofthe hair, as well as the upward gaze, are shared by some representations of the young Harpocrates wearing a lotusbud crown. It is not impossible that such a crown once existed where parts of the present head are now broken and missing. Cf. Dunand 1990: 80, nos. 180-81, and also 123, no. 317 (with Double Crown, which is similar to depictions of Isis wearing the same crown, Dunand 1990: 156, no. 419.) 7. Figurine fragment.

Tempered with fine (sand-sized to 1 mm) white, gray, and red grit, and frequent micaceous inclusions of similar size. Surfaces as fabric (no slip?). Description: Fragment ofa figurine of indeterminate gender (a child?). Only the head and pointed hat(?) preserved. Horizontal band of hair(?) indicated on forehead. Facial features very faintly indi? cated. Maximum preserved H. c. 2.5 cm, W. 2.3 cm. Date: 3rd-2nd century B.C Discussion and Possible Comparanda: This piece is open to many different interpretations. The hat or hood worn by the figure may be a separate article of clothing such as can be worn by Harpocrates (Petrie 1905:1, pl. XLVIIL54; Graindor 1939: 136, pl. XIX: 55; Perdrizet 1921: 30 [no. 87], 31 [no. 88], and pl. XXIII [from the Fayoum]); and others (Breccia 1930: 73 [nos. 471-72], Tav. XXIII: 4, 5 [from Alexandria]). Or it could have been intended to depict a himation tightly drawn over the head. Very often, when worn in this manner, the garment forms a point at the top of the head above the face (cf. Morgantina Types VI-VIII, Bell 1981: 52, fig. C; and specifically 200: nos. 621 and 742 [Type VIII]; Breccia 1978: 20, pl. IV:15, V:18, from Hadra cemetery). Such an interpretation, how? ever, would not explain what is happening to the hood above the face at either side of the figurine. Was this part ofa group figure? Also worth considering are an infant (Dunand 1990: 265, no. 781), the head of a warrior or hunter (Thompson, et al 1987.* 159, no. 13, Athenian Agora), a small child being carried by a black male (Adriani 1940: 170 [inv. no. 25091], pl. LXVIIL3, purchased in Alexandria), Attys with "cedar cone" cap (Petrie 1905: 2, pl. XLVIII:53,54, from Ehnasya), Telesphoros (difficult to determine if the hood circles under the chin [Bell 1981: #356-58, Morgantina]), or Athena wearing a Thracian helmet (Bell 1981: #220, 223, p. 158, pl. 56, Morgantina). Also possible is the "flowing" hood, cf. a "circus rider" (Schiirmann 1989: 311, no. 1169, Taf. 194), a gladiator (Schurmann 1989: 311-12, no. 171, Tafi 194) or a comic actor (Bell 1981: 68, 213-14, no. 742, pl. 117). It is not impossible to reconstruct this figure as a woman wearing a kerchief, and that the piece has fractured along the lines where the kerchief would have been tied under the chin as in Laumonier 1956: 249, nos. 1141-42, pl 86. Also relevant are Dunand 1990: 239, no. 671; and Breccia 1930: 32, Tav. DI; and 42, Tav. XIII:7. 8. Figurine fragment. Isis-Aphrodite(?)

Discussion and Possible Comparanda: The best parallel in terms of similarity and provenance for this figurine is the well-preserved combination of Aphrodite and Isis from Naukratis in the British Museum (Higgins 1967: XXXVIII, 132 [BM Cat. C574], pl. 63E), which is so similar that they could have been made from the same mold. Similar statuettes of Isis-Aphrodite displaying the same stance are known from Bubastis (Schiirmann 1989: 271?72, nos. 1031-34, Taf. 171?72), and else? where in Egypt (Graindor 1939: 107-9, no. 36, pl. XIV, and references page 108 note 1; Birmingham Museum 1968: 40, no. 164, pl. 28; Philipp 1972: 23 and 32, cat. nos. 18 and 47, Abb. 17 and 43-44; Breccia 1930: 44 no. 172, Tav. LIIL21 [Hadra Cemetery, Alexandria]; and Dunand 1990: 125, no. 327 and 130, no. 338). Several similar pieces, without the legs preserved, are in the collections ofthe Lou? vre (Dunand 1990, especially nos. 328-39).12 In spite of the probability that these feet represent Isis-Aphrodite, the identification cannot be con? sidered to be absolutely certain since both the frontality and the tightly pressed legs can be found on other figurine types: Silenus-Hermes (Koster 1926: 202, no. 744, Taf. 123); and Fruchtbarkeitsgottin (Bayer-Niemeyer 1988: 141-42, no. 244 [with anklets], 245-47; and the gbttin mit Kalathos (Weber 1914: 132-35, nos. 200-206, and Taf. 20).

Tempered with fine (sand-sized to 1 mm) white, gray, and red grit, and frequent micaceous inclusions of similar size. Surfaces as fabric (no visible slip). White (lime?) accretions and black spots (secondary burning) on exterior surfaces. Description: Standing/advancing male in chiton and himation. Right hand bent at elbow, left hand to side. Head and neck as well as legs below the knees are missing. Maximum preserved H. c. 8.1 cm, W. c. 4.0 cm. Date: 3rd century B.C. Discussion and Possible Comparanda: In the field, this piece was identified and catalogued as an advancing male with long phallus, a theme that would be quite at home at Naukratis, but one for which it is difficult to find close parallels. Without the phallic attribute, however, the figurine resem? bles a series of comic actors from Morgantina (Bell 1981: 214-15, nos. 745, 751, pl. 118; based on his no. 743), which Bell has interpreted as pseudokore figures from the phlyax of Middle Comedy of the third century B.C, where male actors in women's roles were especially common (1981: 68, 214-15). For the mirror image (or reverse) of the pose of the Naukratis figure, in which the right arm hangs to the side (holding the garment?) and the left is bent at elbow with hand held in front of the chest, see Higgins 1967: 116-17, pl. 56E (youth with himation). Evidently, figurines of young men wearing the himation (and often carrying a quiver behind the neck parallel to the ground) were popular during the first few centuries before and after Christ. The example in the British Museum published by Hig? gins (1967: xxxix) was signed by the coroplast Diphilos and dated to the first century A.D. A similar piece (Knaben in Mantel) is published in Bayer-Niemeyer (1988: 60. no. 2, Taf. 1:3). 12. Terracotta vessel fragment. Grapes(?) or stylized hair curls(?)

Tempered with fine (sand- sized to 1 mm) white, gray, and red grit; with frequent micaceous inclusions of similar size. Description: Fragment of terracotta vessel depicting about one dozen semispherical pellets arranged in three rows. Broken, in part, along a seam at which point the back of the vessel would have been attached. Maximum preserved H. 5.8 cm, W. 4.2 cm.</page><page sequence="187">1998 Miscellaneous Material Culture 171 Date: 2nd century B.C. Discussion and Possible Comparanda: Although this fragment could be interpreted as the tightly curled hairs ofa herm (Thompson et al. 1987: 434, pl. 58 [T1566] from Athens), it is more likely that it originally formed a part of a bunch of grapes or, as will be noted, hair in the form of grapes. Moldmade, terracotta representations of bunches of grapes, or the molds themselves, range from iso? lated bunches for suspension as an ornament (Laumonier 1956: 268, nos. 1257, 1258, pl. 96), as part ofthe overflowing bounty ofa cornucopia (Laumonier 1956: 280, nos. 1353, 1354, pl. 100; Thomp? son et al. 1987: 12-13, no. 12, pl. 5), or as part ofa feast for a lion (Laumonier 1956: 284, no. 1372, pl. 103). Also relevant is the series of moldmade terracotta (and later blown glass) cluster-of-grapes vessels that were common in the Egyptian Fayoum. This type could represent a bunch of grapes by itself (Bayer-Niemeyer 1988: 282-83, nos. 757-59, Taf. 129, 3rd century B.c, Dunand 1990: 331, nos. 1002-3, Roman; and Kaufmann 1915: [nos. 808-10] Taf. 74 a variety of types), or the form could be modified to serve, inter alia, as the beard of Dionysos/Bacchus (Bayer-Niemeyer 1988: 283, no. 760, Taf. 130:2; Dunand 1990: 330-31, nos. 1000-1001) or Serapis (Kaufmann 1915: Taf. 14:74). Similar in concept, but on a larger scale, are the masks of Dionysos Botrys, pierced to be worn or suspended, that probably served in part as the inspiration for the smaller containers (Laumonier 1956: 124, no. 315, pl. 34 with references). Morphologically, however, it is not impossible that what are interpreted as grapes on the Naukratis piece may have been the spherical projections (flames?) that are represented above the doorways on some moldmade terracotta "lanterns" in the form of a lighthouse, perhaps representing the pharos at Alexandria (Bayer-Niemeyer 1988: 261-62, nos. 665-70, Taf. 116-17).14 13.

Interior- fired black in spots; traces of pink (no Munsell equivalent) paint on front of drapery. Description: Small fragment of vertically hanging drapery with moderately deep folds. Preserved H. c. 5.5 cm, W. c. 2.3 cm. Date: 3rd-2nd century B.C Discussion and Possible Comparanda: Pendant drapery is an integral part of many of the themes of Tanagra and other Hellenistic figurines. Although fragmentary, this segment of drapery most proba? bly hung from the outstretched left hand/arm ofa standing female figurine (Kleiner 1984: 251, 261, Taf. 12a, b; 116-118, Taf. 19a-f; Bol and Kotera 1986: 146-148, nos. 74-75, and possibly no. 150; cf. also Koster 1926: no. 44-49; and Breccia 1930: 27, Tav.

The front</page><page sequence="188">172 Albert Leonard, Jr. AASOR 55 (exterior) surface was slipped c. 7.5YR 3/6 (Dark Red); and the unslipped back (interior) surface had been fired between 10R 6/8 (Light Red) and 10R 5/8 (Red). Description: Representation ofa piece of drapery, hanging in six folds. Maximum preserved H. 3.9 cm, W. 4.1 cm. Date: Uncertain. Discussion and Possible Comparanda: This fragment of drapery appears to be in the negative, and it may have served as an archetype or patrix from which other molds (for sculpture in terracotta or another medium) would have been fashioned. The original sculpture, of which this is but a small fragment, would have been fairly large. The representation of the drapery, itself, is too general for meaningful comparanda, but the fact that the folds do not hang vertically, but show some evidence of an S-curve (curls?), might indicate that the garment clothed someone engaged in (a lateral?) move? ment (cf. the chiton on a young girl playing ephedrismos [Birmingham Museum 1968: 32, no. 120, pl. 34]). 15. Fragment ofa mold(?). Drapery (pl. 3.13) Locus 13006 N.III. 130.17 MC#21 Technique: Moldmade. Fabric: Well-levigated Delta silt.

Finely ground (sand-sized to 1 mm) white, gray, and red grit temper, with fre? quent micaceous inclusions of similar size. A thick 7.5YR 4/6 (Red) to 3/6 (Dark Red) slip covers the exterior. Description: a. Hoof(?). Maximum preserved H. 4.4 cm, W 3.4 cm. b. Unidentifiable object. Maximum preserved H. 1.8 cm, W 2.4 cm. Date: Indeterminate. Discussion: These two pieces were found together in the same debris locus and, therefore, they most probably come from the same plaque. The thick slip that covers the exterior surface of these pieces makes them superior to most of the other pieces in the assemblage and among most of the com? paranda. The individual pieces, however, do not give any clue to the original subject matter. Possible Comparanda: For the tentative identification ofthe one image as a hoof, cf. Dunand 1990: 87, no. 184, which depicts a young Harpocrates (carrying an ovoid pot) riding on a camel.</page><page sequence="189">1998 Miscellaneous Material Culture 173 17.

Maximum preserved H. c. 6.5 cm, W. c. 3.4 cm. Date: Indeterminate. Discussion and Possible Comparanda: This fragment is really too small to allow identification of the subject matter with any certainty. Two possible interpretations are: the front ofa chair or throne (Petrie 1905: 2, pl. XLVL16 [seated Serapis from Ehnasya]; Rohde 1968: 46, fig. 30; Bayer-Niemeyer 1988: 132-33, no. 220, Taf. 42:5, also nos. 273-74?; Philipp 1972: 26, cat. no. 27, Abb. 24 [Isis and Harpocrates]; Koster 1926: pl. 80); Dunand 1990: 98-99, nos. 219-20 (invert the Naukratis piece); or some element in an architectural setting (Bayer-Niemeyer 1988: 270-71, nos. 700-702, Taf. 121:5-7 [lanterns of unknown provenance]). Most of these examples, however, have been assigned dates that are later than those offered for the Naukratite pieces. Terracotta Lamps Ten complete or fragmentary lamps were found during our four seasons of excavations at Naukratis, a surprisingly small number when one considers the amount of other ceramic material that the work had produced and the fact that Petrie had found 280 lamps during the first season of his work at the site (1886: 45). The lamps are presented below according to the method of their manufac- ture. The dates offered can only be considered approximate as the study of Ptolemaic lamps has been hampered by the fact that most are known primarily from multiple-burial funerary contexts and museum collections, and they are rarely from stratigraphically secure domestic deposits. Wheelmade Lamps 18. Lamp (pl. 3.16 a, b and fig. 3.1:1) Locus 7613 N.III.76.45 MC#104 Preservation: Intact. H. c. 7.5 cm; W. c. 7.1 cm Technique: Wheelmade saucer, pinched at sides to form a lip or channel for the wick. String-cut base. Fabric: Well-levigated Delta silt. Fine (sand-sized to 1 mm) white, gray, and red grit temper with fre? quent micaceous inclusions of similar size. Fabric c. 7.5R 5/6 (Red) to 10R 5/4 (Weak Red), with a core ranging from 7.5YR 4/2 (Weak Red) to 10R 5/8 (Red), and a slip between 10YR 6/8 (Light Red) and 5/8 (Red). Burnt black at tip ofthe pinched lip. Date: Third Intermediate-Ptolemaic Periods. Discussion: Among the lamps found by Petrie during his first season of work at Naukratis were 32 examples of "little flat dishes pinched in to form a spout" (Petrie 1886: 45). Only a single example of this type, however, was found during our excavations. The origins of the saucer lamp can be traced back at least to the beginnings of the Middle Bronze Age in Palestine when the old, four-spouted lamp of the Early Bronze IV (Early-Middle Bronze)</page><page sequence="190">174 Albert Leonard, Jr. AASOR 55 period gave way to the single-spouted variant (Amiran 1969: 82, pl. 22:11 vs 22:16; and pl. 24:13 vs 24:14). This lamp type continued to develop in the Levant throughout the Iron Age and was still common in the Iron HC/Persian period (Amiran 1969: 291-93 and pl. 100), which was contempo? rary with the earlier part of the Third Intermediate Period in Egypt. In the Athenian Agora, Thomp? son viewed the Cocked Hat type as a local Egyptian product and also noted that it was one of the two most popular lamp types in the Chatby Cemetery at Alexandria (Howland 1958: 7-8 [Type 1], 12 [Type 3], 12-13 [Type 4]). Daszewski 1987 included similar Egyptian pieces in his group of lampes tournees ouvertes, which he divided into three subtypes (1-3), primarily on the distinctiveness of the spout/lip. The Naukratis lamp would fall somewhere between his types 2 and 3. Noting the lack of attention paid to this form of lamp in Egyptian contexts, Hayes suggested a date in the third century B.C. for their demise in Egypt, at a time when wheelmade Greek types first began to be common there (1980a: 4-5). Daszewski, however, would see their popularity continue into the second century B.C. (1987: 51-52). Saucer lamps from Naukratis are in the Royal Ontario Museum (Hayes 1980a: 5, nos. 7-9) and in the British Museum (Bailey 1975,1: 240 and 244, no. Q515).20 19. Lamp.

Body separated from the rim of the filling hole by a relatively deep groove. Raised base, slightly concave. Trace of a (vestigial?) lug/wing on left hand side. Nozzle splayed out? ward ending in slight flukes. Top of nozzle flattened with ridges parallel to the sides. L. 8.0 cm; W 5.2 cm; H. 2.9 cm. Technique: Wheelmade. Fabric: Well-levigated Delta silt. Fine (sand-sized to 1 mm) white, gray, and red grit temper with fre? quent micaceous inclusions of similar size. Fabric c. 7.5R 5/6 (Red) to 10R 5/4 (Weak Red), with a core ranging from 7.5YR 4/2 (Weak Red) to 10R 5/8 (Red) to which has been added a 7.5YR 4/6 (Red) to 3/6 (Dark Red) slip. Exterior surfaces mottled to black in places. Date: Last quarter of 4th and first half ofthe 3rd century B.C. Discussion: Morphologically this lamp is closely related to examples of Daszewski's Egyptian lampes tournees fermees Types 4 and 5 (1987: 52 and fig. 1), that he describes as most closely following How- land's Type 25 series from the Athenian Agora (Howland 1958: 67-82). The form is included within Broneer's Type VII at Corinth (1930: 45?46 and nos. 114-36) and shares some elements of Shier's Type Al.l and A2.1 lamps at Karanis (1978: 13-15). Thompson considered the angular variant of these lamps (his Type IX) to have been among the most popular lamps in use in Athens during the third century B.C. (Thompson et al. 1987: 423, 447, 461). That this Athenian fashion was as popu? lar as it was in Egypt should not be surprising since it was also the Athenian lamp type that had the most influence on the local lampmakers even further west at Sidi Khrebish (Berenice) in Libya (Bailey 1985: 191). Moldmade Lamps The moldmade lamp now appears to have made its appearance in Egyptian contexts sometime early in the third century B.C. (Daszewski 1987: 550; Shier 1978: 4-5, 17), about the same time that</page><page sequence="191">1998 Miscellaneous Material Culture 175 0 12 3 4 Fig. 3.1.

Solid (unturned) disc base. Sloping nozzle of medium length, flattened on top, and flaring toward embryonic flukes at the sides ofthe wick hole. Two opposing, solid lugs form angular projections (wings) at the sides. Complete. L. 6.5 cm; W 5.1 cm; H. 2.1 cm. Technique: Moldmade in two pieces. Fabric: Well-levigated Delta silt.

Date: End of 3rd and into the 2nd century B.C. Discussion: In Athenian terms, this lamp most closely resembles Howland's Type 45A, a lamp with molded, relief decoration that was imported to Athens during the middle years of the third century B.C. (Howland 1958: 143-45), and was copied enthusiastically for several centuries by the Athenian lampmakers using local Attic clays. Howland suggested an Alexandrian origin for these moldmade lamps on the basis ofthe grayish fabric ofthe examples from the Agora (1958: 145), but the Naukratis lamp is crafted from the reddish Delta silt that is so common at the site and is only mottled gray (in places) through secondary burning. In Egyptian terms this lamp would fall morphologically somewhere between Daszewski's molded Hellenistic lamps of Type 12 and Type 13 (1987: 55, and fig. 2), in that it contains some attributes of both. At Karanis in the Fayoum, this is Shier's Type A.4.1 (1978: 9, 18 [with comparanda], especially no. 10 [p. 55] and pls. 1, 10). Similar lamps from Egypt, but without specific provenance, in the Brit? ish Museum are dated by Bailey to the second century B.C. (1975: 255-56, especially nos. Q546 [Luxor?] and Q549 [Thebes?]), and/or into the early part of the first century B.C. (1975: 271-73, especially nos. Q589, Q590, Q592 [Dakeh, Nubia?], and Q593 [Buto/Tell el-Fara'in]). A related, but much more carefully crafted lamp was excavated by Petrie at Naukratis during his first season of work at the site (Bailey 1975: 273-74, Q594, with comparanda). Several similar lamps, also from the Fay? oum but now in the Royal Ontario Museum, were published by Hayes and dated primarily in the sec? ond century B.C. (1980a: 21-23, 34-35, especially nos. 78-79, 84-85, and 161). 21. Lamp.

Fine (sand-sized to 1 mm) white, gray, and red grit temper with fre? quent micaceous inclusions of similar size. Fabric c. 7.5R 5/6 (Red) to 10R 5/4 (Weak Red), with a core ranging from 7.5YR 4/2 (Weak Red) to 10R 5/8 (Red) and traces of an abraded 7.5YR 4/6 (Red) to 3/6 (Dark Red) slip. Black charring at nozzle. Date: Last quarter of 3rd through first half of 2nd century B.C. Discussion: It is difficult to assign this lamp precisely, but it seems to be related (at least morpholog? ically) to Howland's Athenian Agora Type 43A or to some ofthe poor relations included in his Type 43D, both of which, however, have raised bases (1958: 133-38). His unglazed Type 43D prime that exhibits the flat base of the Kom Hadid lamp is thought to date to the first half of the second century B.C. (1958: 138). ir Imported Amphorae Simple Rims The majority of the amphorae from Kom Hadid display rather simple rims (fig. 3.2) and were crafted from a fabric that suggests a Rhodian origin. In presenting this material we use as a base-point a fragment of the upper portion of an amphora from our excavations in the South Mound at Kom Ge'if. It was executed in a c. 5YR 7/6-6/6 (Red? dish Yellow) fabric, with a c. 10YR 8/3 (Very Pale Brown) slip, and a band of fugitive c. 10YR 5/8-4/8 (Red) paint below the rim. It also bore the impression of a stamp on its handle that Rehard attributed to a Rhodian fabricant and to which he assigned a date in the second century B.C. (Rehard in Coulson 1996: 152, no. 17, fig. 59:17, pl. XX:7). This association of shape, fabric, and provenance is strength- ened by the presence of a similar amphora fragment in the Kom Hadid corpus: see #26 below, whose handle also had been stamped with a Rhodian eponym thought to date to the second century B.C. and, perhaps more specifically, between the destruction of Carthage in 146 B.C. and the demise of Samaria in 108 B.C. (Rehard in Coulson 1996: 150, no. 7, fig. 57:7, and pl. XIX:7). Because the fab- ric/slip, and especially the internally beveled rim, of these two pieces can be paralleled very closely by fig. 3.2:9 (complete with red band) and figs. 3.2:14-15,18-19 (without the painted band), it would seem safe to assume that these five pieces should also be considered to be of Rhodian manufacture and to date within the third-second centuries B.C. Morphologically related forms executed in the same or similar fabric that exhibit a rounder but still beveled rim (fig. 3.2:4) as well as a flatter form in the same fabric (fig. 3.2:21) are considered to have been of Rhodian manufacture. This is also true for examples of the apparently associated rims (in the same fabric) with a slight groove or channel around the top, either with (fig. 3.2:11) or without (fig. 3.2:12) the painted red band.30 The rims of several other imported amphorae, however, are less easy to identify and/or to analyze. For instance, the concavity of the inner profile of fig. 3.2:2 (visually similar to the "Rhodian" fabric discussed above), is also present on fig. 3.2:10, which has been crafted from a visibly different fabric. Morphologically, the closest parallels from the Naukratis survey that display such a profile are pieces that were included by Coulson in his Type X amphora rim, all of which were of local clay and thought to be of Roman inspiration. At a later date, a distinctively concave inner-profile will appear on the widely-traded Dressel 20 amphorae whose necks were shorter than those of the Kom Hadid pieces. The Dressel 20, however, is believed to have evolved from the more elongated Oberaden 83 shape, the rims of which often display a very subtle concavity to their interior profiles, and whose floruit began in</page><page sequence="194">178 Albert Leonard, Jr. AASOR 55 Figure 3.2.

Such concavity does appear on the rims of some of the Dressel 2-4 published by Laubenheimer from French contexts, some of which were executed in eastern fabrics (1989: 18-23, and fig. 6:5, especially nos. 3-5). The chronological interface between the Oberaden 83 and the more conservative forms of the Dressel 20 is thought to have been close to the millennial change, and such a date would fit more closely with other aspects of the material culture at Naukratis. Likewise, the profile of fig. 3.2:3, executed in the fabric here associated with Rhodes, is similar to (albeit slightly more open than) that of fig. 3.2:6, though this was made from a very different (Knid? ian?) fabric. The closest parallels to the shape of these rims that were encountered during the Naukratis survey, were considered by Coulson to be "local imitations of amphorae from the island of Cos" (1996: 48, and fig. 23; his Types I [especially no. 1560] and J [no. 27]). The rim of the rather closed-mouth vessel illustrated on fig. 3.3:3 is very difficult to parallel as it has been drawn and, in retrospect, should probably be visualized as coming from a more open form and included here with fig. 3.2:3 and 6. A second, smaller group of sherds in the Kom Hadid corpus also appears to form a distinctive fab? ric type. These pieces are characterized by a c. 5YR [or 7.5YR] 8/4 (Pink) core/fabric that had been covered with a 10YR 8/3-8/4 (Very Pale Brown) slip. This combination of fabric and slip, as well as slight variations of it, is the hallmark of most of the bifed (double rolled or double barrelled) handles found at Kom Hadid (see fig. 3.3:6-7, 11-12). This is a distinctive type of handle that is usually asso? ciated with the island of Cos. Thus a Koan origin or prototype is assumed for vessels made from this fabric. Koan amphorae and their derivatives were said by Coulson to have been the second largest group of amphorae recovered during his survey of the environs of Naukratis (1996: 47). Three relatively simple rims appear in this fabric at Kom Hadid. Fig. 3.2:1 and 7 may be consid? ered to be variants of a rolled or rounded bead rim not unlike those included among the widely dis- tributed Class 9 amphorae of Peacock and Williams (1986: 102-3). They appear in at least seven different fabrics only two of which were believed to have come from the island of Rhodes whose forms they seem to imitate (1986: 15; Peacock 1977). Similarities in profile, however, can also be found with examples of Peacock and Williams' Class 10 amphorae that were also produced in several workshops (and hence they are made of different fabrics), which they describe as "the most important western Mediterranean wine amphora of the early Empire" (1986: 106). Although the bifed handles of the latter group definitely indicate a high degree of Koan inspiration for the class, it is perhaps best to recall the caveat of Peacock and Williams that "it is impossible to distinguish production centers on the basis of shape" (1986: 106). That certainly seems to be the case with fig. 3.2:5 and 8, although the pulled out rim of the latter piece can be paralleled on pseudo-Koan amphorae found at Paphos (Hayes 1991:86, no. 18, fig. 37:5). The slightly more angular profile of fig. 3.2:13 seems to be morphologically midway between the squarer variants of the Koan, or Koan-inspired, forms and some of the internally beveled rims that are assigned above to the island of Rhodes. The rim shown on fig. 3.2:20 could possibly be related to the Haltern 70 amphora whose "collar rim is distinctive and always everted" (Sealey 1985: 59, and fig. 8:74, 76) and which flourished from the mid-first century B.C. through the first century A.D. (Sealey 1985: 64); or even the Lamboglia 2, or Dressel 6, rims of Augustan date discussed by Desbat and Martin-Kilcher 1989. One of a group of three rims attributed to Dressel 6 amphorae from Well 18 at Paphos are also dated to the Augustan period (Hayes 1991: 180, 186 (no. 74), fig. 44:74-76. No. 76 is the closest to the Kom Hadid frag? ment. Also possibly related is the Apulian(?) rim discussed by Hayes on page 86 (no. 21, fig. 37:7).</page><page sequence="197">1998 Miscellaneous Material Culture 181 Fig. 3.2:16 and 17 are less easy to document although the former may be related to Phoenician or Punic forms that often share the swollen upper neck, while 3.2:17 is reminiscent of some of the imitation Koan amphorae from Paphos published by Hayes (1991:86 no. 20, fig. 37:9). More Complex Rims Thicker or more complex amphora rims from the Kom Hadid assemblage are included in this dis? cussion (fig. 3.3:1-5). Although they are numerically the smaller group, they do seem to reflect greater geographic and chronological diversity than is the case with the simpler forms. Fig. 3.3:1 is a rim fragment from an example of Dressel's type 1 amphora and, more specifically, Dressel type IB of Lamboglia's (1955: 252-60) subdivision of the original form since it exhibits much more verticality in the profile of the collar rim than the slightly in-turning rim of his type IC. Peacock and Williams included the Dressel IB with their Class 4 amphorae and assigned to it an approximate date from the second quarter of the first century B.C. to the last decade of that century (1986: 90). The rim illustrated in fig. 3.3:2 may be associated with Class 16 in the taxonomy of Peacock and Williams who have isolated five sub-types based primarily on the shape of the body and the pres? ence of a vertical, median furrow on the handle, both of which are lacking on the Kom Hadid frag? ment. The profile of the rim and the degree to which it is outsplayed is paralleled in their type A (1986: fig. 30:A) for which they have assigned a first century B.C date and a decidedly western and northern distribution. This shape appears to have been made in many workshops and in many differ? ent fabrics (1986: 119).44 The thickest amphora rims in the Hadid corpus are shown in fig. 3.3:4 and especially fig. 3.3:5. They both display a round, rolled, or bead rim that, given their thickness, is difficult to parallel in deposits contemporary with most of the other amphorae from the site. Some similarities with examples of Peacock and Williams' Class 20 can be seen, but the two groups differ markedly in fabric and, although the shape was exported to the east (as far as Benghazi), it does not appear to predate the early first century A.D. Perhaps a better parallel would be the bulbous first century B.C. amphorae from the Brinidisi area that bear the stamp of M. Tuccius Galeo, at least one of which had reached the markets of Alexandria (Cipriano and Carre 1989: 74-77 and the distribution map, fig. 8). Convincing comparanda for the neck and rim fragment with elliptical (in section) handle illus? trated in fig. 3.3:8, are difficult to find. The distinctive profile of Kom Hadid figs. 3.3:9 and 3.3:10 indicate that they are both examples of the Greco-Italic amphora included by Peacock and Williams with their Class 2 amphorae. This group of vessels has been closely examined by Will, who isolated five subcategories of the type from an earlier "a" through a later "e" (1982: 343-44). The color of the fabric of the rims from Kom Hadid would fit most closely with the fabric either of her type a2 which had a floruit in the early third cen? tury B.C. and does not appear to have been exported further east than Carthage, or the redder variant of her second century B.C. form "d" that is said to echo Rhodian prototypes. A stamped example of the latter type has actually been found at Alexandria (Will 1982: 353). Handles Six amphora handles of non-local fabric from the excavations at Kom Hadid are illustrated here. Four of these (figs. 3.3:6-7, 11-12) are bifed or double-rolled handles that suggest either Koan manu- facture or inspiration. The color(s) of their fabrics and slips fall within the range of fabrics from which</page><page sequence="198">182 Albert Leonard, Jr. AASOR 55 Koan and pseudo-Koan amphorae were crafted and have been noted in the discussion of Peacock and Williams' Classes 10 and 11 (see note 38 and the text cited there), which begin to appear during the first century B.C. Such double handles also appear on examples of their Class 39 (1986: 39) for which an Aegean origin has been suggested and whose major period of popularity seems to have been early in the first century A.D. Double-barreled handles in a wide spectrum of fabrics were common in the material collected by Coulson during his survey of the environs of Naukratis. He also calls attention to their distinctively Koan character (1996: 61, and fig. 31, Type G). Of the two single-rolled handles, the right angle (joining neck to shoulder) of the amphora shown on fig. 3.3:13 could have originated on a wide variety of amphorae with a considerable range of shapes and dates. In connection with the survey material Coulson noted a vague connection between (long) handles with round cross sections and the island of Rhodes, especially during the third century B.C. (1996: 60, his Type A, and fig. 30). The length and elliptical cross section of fig. 3.3:14 also suggest a Rhodian origin to the present author as do the color(s) of its fabric and slip. Compare its fabric with that of the stamped handle #26 below, that bears a Rhodian eponym. Toes Fragments of amphora toes (or spikes) of nonlocal fabric are even more difficult to identify than rims and handles. Even discussion of the physical appearance of the fragments is hampered by the fact that the fabric is often thicker at the toe and may not fire to the same color(s) as did the thinner, upper portion of the vessel, and the slip may have been abraded from frequent securing of the vessel in the sand or other abrasive media. Of all the morphologically diagnostic elements of an amphora it was the toe that suffered most. However, for the sake of completeness a representative selection is offered here. Comparanda for the most part has been limited to the identification of similar pieces from the Naukratis survey. The amphora represented by the rather solid toe of fig. 3.4:1 appears to be of Thasian manufac? ture, although a Mendean origin cannot be excluded. The toes of Chian amphorae similar to those illustrated on figs. 3.4:2-4 were described by Coul? son as "having a hollow on (their) underside with a lip that turns back outward forming a narrow cuff" (1996: 53). He dated these to the last quarter of the fourth century B.C. (1996: 53 in reference to his type A toes). During the third century B.C. he saw the hollow of such toes becoming smaller and the cuff becoming more pronounced (1996: 53-54, his type C). Similar features are seen on some of the vessels that Coulson viewed, correctly or incorrectly, as having been derived from Mendean or even possibly Attic prototypes (1996: 58-59 and fig. 29). However, A. Berlin, tentatively supported by M. Lawall (personal communication), sees these toes as Cypriot and that is the attribution that is followed here. Another group of toes, figs. 3.4:5-7, displays a small collar above the rounded point of termina- tion. It is instructive to see how this amphora was fashioned (pl. 3:20a and b) since the present (or latest) band and lower projection of the toe had been formed by the addition of a separate piece of clay that was used to cap (or recap?) a preexisting toe that would have presented to the typologist a very different profile. Toes similar to these appear on Knidian and Koan amphorae (both genuine and deriv- ative) and are most probably to be dated to the late second through the first century B.C. The toe shown in fig. 3.4:9 appears to be a variant of this group in which the height of the collar has been reduced considerably. It thus forms a morphological transition to those toes in which the</page><page sequence="199">1998 Miscellaneous Material Culture 183 upper edge of the collar has ceased to exist as a separate unit (figs 3.4:10-12) and the lower edge now represents the only break in the profile. The closest example to this phenomenon in the material from the Naukratis survey is Coulson's Type 03 of Koan inspiration and of first century B.C. date (1996: 55, and fig. 27:1073; see also 96, n. 218 for reference to a similar, but unpublished, Koan amphora from Rhodes that is dated c. 200 B.C.). The shape is also similar to some of the toes from Paphos that were thought to be related to Knidian examples (Hayes 1991:86 [especially no. 6], and fig. 37.3). The origin of the toe illustrated on fig. 3.4:8 can be assigned to Knidos with a bit more certainty. A distinctly hemispherical toe, fig. 3.4:13, can be paralleled only by a single example from the survey: Coulson's Type ZA (1996: 60, and fig. 30: 1106). This form, he believed, had been derived from an unpublished specimen from the Agora excavations to which had been assigned a date as late as the second or early third centuries A.D. Such a date would be later than that proposed for the majority of the material excavated at Kom Hadid, but no other comparanda are available. Plain toes/spikes are the most difficult to attribute with any degree of certainty. Fig. 3.4:14 can be compared with a Koan-inspired toe from the survey dated to the first century B.C. (Coulson 1996: 56, his Type P, fig. 27: 1748); the more cylindrical fig. 3.4: 15 is akin to several Rhodian derivatives of the late third?second centuries B.C. {inter alia, Coulson 1996: 57, Type X, and fig. 28:207); the more rounded fig. 3.4:18 is the standard Rhodian toe of apparently the same date. Fig. 3.4:17 is too amor- phous to elicit convincing parallels while the spikes shown on figs. 3.4:16 and 19 do not appear to have parallels among the material from the Naukratis survey.

Pot Stand(?) with Incised Letters (pl. 3.21:a and fig. 3.6:1, 3) Locus 7613 NIII.76.44 No MC# assigned Technique: Wheelmade. The letters IIE had been incised on the underside ofthe stand before it had been fired. Fabric: Well-levigated clay. The core of the fabric ranges from 7.5R 4/4 (Weak Red) to 10R 4/6 (Red) below surfaces c. 7.5R 5/6 (Red) to 10R 5/4 (Weak Red). Sand-sized to 1 mm grit temper in white, gray, and red, with frequent micaceous inclusions of similar size. Unslipped. Description: A fragment of a low, thick-walled ring stand with a finished foot. The basal, internal surface had been incised with two letters while the clay was still soft and before the piece had been fired in the kiln. Date: Ptolemaic Period. Discussion and Comparanda: A total of fifteen fragments of pot stands were registered during the excavations at Kom Hadid of which only two (here 31 and 32) had been incised before firing. These low stands constitute one of the few ceramic forms that were not encountered during our excavations at Kom Ge'if, but four examples (one incised) were recovered during the survey of Naukratis and its environs where they form Coulson's corpus of type B stands (Coulson 1996: 79-80, registration num? bers 1359, 1427, 1542, and 1239 [incised]). Coulson felt that his type B stands were "not paralleled elsewhere in Egypt" (Coulson 1996: 79) and therefore assigned to them the same date as he gave to his taller, type A stands late second to fifth centuries A.D. Berlin, however, citing parallels at Coptos, the Bucheum and Tell el-Maskhuta (Chapter 2), offers a Hellenistic date that seems to be more in line with the rest ofthe pottery from Kom Hadid than does the rather late date suggested by Coulson. As for the function of these pieces, Berlin (Chapter 2) has suggested that they were intended to support amphorae and/or round-bottom jars in a household or domestic setting. This is probably the case, but an alternate hypothesis would interpret them as stacking rings designed to separate individ? ual pots during the firing process. This is the function that Edwards assigned to two similar pieces from the Pnyx whose diameters exactly matched the stacking circles of several of the Megarian bowls in the same deposit. Such an industrial function might account for the extreme discoloration of #32. The objects from the Pnyx are dated to the third to second centuries B.C. (Edwards 1956: unnum- bered introductory page). 32.

Fragments ofa Vessel with Bichrome Decoration (pl. 3.22 and fig. 3.7) Locus 7603 N.III.76.04 MC#29 Technique: Wheelmade. Preservation: Four (nonjoining) sherds considered to be from same vessel. Fabric. Very well-levigated clay. 10R 5/4 (Red) to 7.5YR 4/2 (Weak Red) fabric with frequent white, gray, and red grit temper (to 1 mm) and occasional sand-sized micaceous inclusions. Slip(?) of same color as fabric in/out. Bichrome decoration in white/cream (no Munsell) to 7.5YR 4/2 (Pinkish White) as Fabric IC, and c. 5YR 3/2 (Dusky Red) to black (no Munsell). Date: A.D. 400-600? Discussion: Although crafted in a fabric similar to the basic red Delta silt so frequently encountered at Naukratis (Fabric I, Mineral Tempered Red Ware), this piece differs markedly from the rest ofthe ceramic repertoire known from the site. The vessel appears to be a low, open form with sharply out? splayed sides, that would make the elaborate decoration difficult to view when the piece was placed on a horizontal surface. The decoration itself presents us with one of the few representations of an anthropomorphic theme in the entire pottery corpus. Two fragments present a horizontal band with diagonal slashes of color. The other two fragments (if they should be as closely juxtaposed as they are presented here) seem to provide us with a horizontal metope pattern, in one frame of which is an individual holding an object above shoulder height at his/her right side. The question of whether a human or a deity is represented cannot be answered at this time. It is tempting to interpret the figure as Apollo holding his lyre, or even an element of Christian iconography. With great trepidation, the piece is here (tentatively) attributed to the (post-Meroitic) Nubian X-Group (Ballana Culture) and dated (following Bourriau 1981: 110-11) c. A.D. 400-600, sometime in the period bracketed by the compulsory Christianization of Egypt by Theodosius I in A.D. 390 and the advent of Islam in A.D. 641 Some of the wheelmade pottery of the Ballana culture can be of a red silt fabric with decoration in cream and black, but neither the form nor the decoration can find a satisfying parallel in Adams' definitive corpus of medieval Nubian ceramics (1986 passim). Whether the above attribution is correct or not, the piece is included here for the sake of complete- ness. It certainly seems to be about the latest piece of pottery from the site. Unfortunately it comes from an open, topsoil locus, which presents a wide range of possibilities.</page><page sequence="210">194 Albert Leonard, Jr. AASOR 55 Fig. 3.7. Painted bichrome sherd # 33. Faience The manufacture and use of the "glazed" wares popularly referred to as faience has had a strong association with the site of Naukratis ever since the early work of Petrie at the site (1886: especially 5a, 36-37, 40; and Webb 1978 passim) and can, in fact, be traced back to the Egyptian Predynastic Period of the fourth millennium B.C. (Lucas and Harris 1962: 155; and the very technical treatment by Kaczmarczyk and Hedges 1983). Many loci from our excavations at Kom Hadid, as well as from our work at Kom Ge'if (Leonard 1997: figs. 7.11 and 7.12), produced many tiny bits of faience that were simply too small to reconstruct the shape, or even the size of the original vessel, and the presence of such morphologically nondiagnostic pieces has simply been noted in the Locus Summaries. In other instances, however, the wet soils of Naukratis had been less cruel, and the fragments were large</page><page sequence="211">1998 Miscellaneous Material Culture 195 enough that they could be drawn and reconstructed on paper. These pieces are presented below and related, where possible, to similar forms in the ceramic repertoire to which appeal is usually made for their date. If one follows the general trend "from a yellowish toward a cleaner whiter paste" noticed by Thompson (1973: 11) as having been completed by the reign of Ptolemy IV Philopator (murdered in 205 B.C), this would provide the Kom Hadid corpus with a terminuspost quem toward the end of the third century B.C. Monochrome Faience Vessels Twenty-two morphologically diagnostic sherds comprise the Kom Hadid corpus of monochrome faience tableware. This number includes small dishes with internally thickened rims (fig. 3.8:6, 8- 12; fig. 3.9:10-12, 14, 15),70 vessels with straight rims (fig. 3.9:13 and variants fig. 3.8:7, 11), and the distinctive echinus bowls with incurved rim (figs. 3.8:5; fig. 3.9:9). A single vessel exhibited a simple, rounded base without a distinct foot (fig. 3.8:1), but most pieces presented a ring base or ele- vated foot (fig. 3.8:2-4; fig. 3.9: 6-8). All of these features can be paralleled in the pottery assem? blage from the site (see above, Chapter 2). Decorated Faience Vessels Five of the faience fragments (three body sherds and two rims) exhibit traces of decoration that had been executed in a second (or third) color. A small body sherd (fig. 3.9:1) with yellow surfaces has been enhanced with a light green band on the interior and a light brown design on the exterior. A second vessel (fig. 3.9:2; pl. 3.23b) was decorated on what appears to have been the exterior of the vessel with a light blue floral(?) pattern against a very pale blue background. This floral element is very reminiscent (to the author at least) of the Mycenaean Flower that often appears on the shoulders of Aegean stirrup jars that were traded widely around the eastern Mediterranean during the Late Bronze Age, and were actually imitated?in faience?in Egyptian workshops. A third body sherd (fig. 3.9:3, pl. 3.24) has been given a slightly three-dimensional scale pattern, the raised portions of which appear lighter in color than the interstices in which more of the blue-green glaze has accumulated. A similar design was excavated at Samaria (Reisner 1924: 326, no. 5a). Of the rim sherds, one (fig. 3.9:4; pl. 3.25) displays a dark brown band within which a cable pattern appears in reserve allowing the band to contrast with the white color of the surface. The inte? rior of the other rim was embellished with a dark brown petal design radiating from the center of the white interior surface. Similarly decorated fragments are also known from Samaria (Reisner 1924: 327, nos. lb and 2a). 34. Base (fig. 3.8:1) Locus 4803 N.III.48.04 MC#2 Fabric: Faience.

Dimensions: 9.0 x 6.0 x 6.0 cm. Date: 6th century B.C.(?). Description: A fragment interpreted as representing the nape of the neck of a kouros statue. One side exhibits a series of parallel cuttings perhaps indicating plaited hair (pl. 27). A rust-stained dowel-hole(?) is partially preserved at break (pl. 28). Discussion: Because of the paucity of fine stone in the Western Delta, all such pieces encountered during our excavations at Kom Hadid were registered. This piece had been registered simply as a mis? cellaneous piece of imported marble. Subsequent study ofthe photographs ofthe piece (after it was no longer available for firsthand study) has suggested the present identification. Although the piece is too fragmentary for further attribution, an Archaic stone statue would not be out of place at the site. 62.

Description: Fragment of fluted column in soft white limestone. Discussion: The reconstructed diameter (c. 25 cm) of this fragment is smaller than either of the two fluted drums that Hogarth encountered in the cemetery of Naukratis (Hogarth 1898/99: 23). It is also smaller in diameter than any of the drums discovered during the survey in a very secondary position built into a bench in the modern village of Kom Ge'if (Coulson 1996: 14-16, fig. 7 and pl. VII-VIII), some of which were also fluted. 64a. Fragment of stone (pl. 3.31a) Locus 6205 N.III.62.23 MC#57 Material: White marble. Dimensions: 12.0 x 12.3 x 1.5 cm. Date: Ptolemaic. Description: Broken piece of gray and white marble with traces of plaster adhering to one flat side. Discussion: Although pieces of such stone "veneer" could have been employed to decorate either the walls or floor of a structure, they most probably indicate the presence of a building with an opus sectile pavement at the site. 64b. Fragment of stone (pl. 3.31b) Locus 6301 N.III.63.02 MC#25 Material: Red porphyry. Dimensions: 9.2 x 6.0 x 1.3 cm. Date: Ptolemaic. Description: Broken piece of red porphyry. Discussion: As is the case with 64a above, this fragment of porphyry most probably indicates the presence of a structure decorated with a flooring of opus sectile (or the more specific opus alexandri- num employing only red and green stones) somewhere in the vicinity. This would have been a luxuri- ous touch to a building at Naukratis since stone of any kind is very scarce in the area. 65. Two fragments of aggregate pavement 65a. Locus 7619 N.III.76.71 MC#135 (pls. 3.32a, 3.33a) 65b. Locus 7619 N.III.76.72 MC#149 (pls. 3.32b, 3.33b) Material: Mixed composition. Dimensions: 65a: 8.6 x 8.1 cm; 65b: 6.0 x 6.1 cm. Description: These fragments appear to illustrate the individual stages in the construction of pavement as described by Pliny, Vitruvius and other ancient authors. A basal layer of coarse, gray lime mortar (the ruduss) containing inclusions of iridescent white shell, gray stone, red brick/ceramic, and kiln waste (averaging 3-5 mm but occasionally as large as 1 cm). The bottom of this layer bore a series of con? cave impressions including those of sticks and branches (average diameter c. 2.5 cm) perhaps repre? senting the subfloor, bedding layer (the statumeri). Above this layer of coarse mortar had been added a second layer of gray, lime mortar (the nucleus) that exhibited frequent, but smaller (sand-sized to 1 mm), inclusions of red (ceramic or brick) binder. Field observation and description noted that into this upper layer a number of unworked, white pebbles of limestone or marble had been set and subsequently</page><page sequence="219">1998 Miscellaneous Material Culture 203 0 t 2 3 4 HT 0 1 2 3 4 /% 3. i0. 4) Fragment ofa limestone ringstand(?)

However, it is not impossible that this layer of grouting was actually an example ofthe layer identified by Moore (1968) as the supra- nucleus and that the stones had been set into it and not into the nucleus. Date: Ptolemaic Period. Discussion: These fragments are presented here simply as pieces of aggregate pavement in spite of the fact that, in the field, they had been registered as portions of a pebble mosaic. This change in nomenclature has been made for two reasons. The first is to avoid their confusion with pebble mosa? ics in the sense of those at Pella, Olynthos, and other sites in the Greek World (von Lorentz 1937) in which water-smoothed stones have been set in an eye-pleasing design or pattern; the second reason is to remove them from any discussion of the origin and development of the true (or tessellated) mosaic, and the attendant argument over the exact meaning and ramifications of the passage in the Deipnosophistai (v. 207c) by Athenaeus (of Naukratis) that related the gift of the Syracusia, a mosaic- decked(?) yacht, by Hieron II of Syracuse to Ptolemy III (Euergetes) who quickly renamed it the Alex- andris. A major champion of the theory for an early- to mid-third century B.C. invention of the tessellated mosaic in Sicily and its subsequent diffusion throughout the Mediterranean world is Kyle Phillips, whose views are based substantially on the presence of the tessellated Ganymede and Eagle mosaic in Room 3 of the House of Ganymede at Morgantina (Phillips 1960). This mosaic stands stylistically in sharp con- trast to the pavements in Rooms 1 and 2 of the same structure where irregular bits of stone had been set into the flooring. On the other hand, note that Dunbabin (1994: 26, and n. 2) no longer sees Ath? enaeus' story of the Alexandris as having any bearing on the development of the tesselated mosaic, objecting in part to the degree of emphasis placed on the Ganymede Mosaic to the exclusion of terrazzo, opus signinum, and other pavement types that appear in the same house (1994: 28-29). These latter pavement types were quite widespread throughout the area and especially in the Punic World where their use can be traced back into the first half of the third century B.C. (1994: 32-39). These two terms, terrazzo and opus signinum, were also considered to describe the Kom Hadid fragments, but were abandoned because of the incredible amount of flexibility that is apparent in the use of these two descriptors. For instance, terrazzo is often used to describe a pavement that is similar to a modern terrazzo floor where pebbles or other bits of stone have actually been incorporated into the nucleus and not individually set into it; while the term opus signinum has been employed to define a variety of pavement types including those in which some (or even most) of the inclusions are bits and pieces of terracotta. Although Dunbabin uses both the terms terrazzo and opus signinum, she considered them both to be unsatisfactory, preferring instead a term such as a "cement pavement" or "pavement of aggregate" (1994: 30-31 and n. 14). This latter term seems best to describe the Kom Hadid fragments, and a so a variant of it, "aggregate pavement," has been utilized here. Regardless of the terminology employed, however, one thing is clear: The main difference between the Kom Hadid fragments and others with which they might be compared is that that the primary intention of the artisans at Naukratis was the creation of a proper, functioning use-surface or pave? ment, and not to produce an artistic embellishment or decoration for the building. The question of whether such decorated floors existed at Naukratis has not yet been answered, nor can we postulate whether the simplicity of the Hadid fragments reflects the function of the structure, the economic status of the owners, or even the lessened importance of the hinterland as power and prestige became more and more concentrated in the port city of Alexandria.</page><page sequence="221">1998 Miscellaneous Material Culture 205 Glass 66. Fragment of an Ingot or palette of blue-green glass (pl. 3.34) Locus 6301 N.III.63.01 MC#26 Material: Blue glass. Dimensions: c. 3.5 x 3.8 cm. Decription: Fragment ofa blue-green glass plaque or ingot with longitudinal grooves. Date: Uncertain Ptolemaic(?). Discussion: Because of the small size of this fragment, identification of its function is difficult. An ingot or other piece of bulk glass would not seem out of place at a site so close to Alexandria that has been described as "one ofthe greatest glass-manufacturing centres of antiquity" (Lucas and Harris 1962: 184), while the use ofthe cosmetic palette to grind kohlis a tradition that extends back thousands of years into the Predynastic period. The blue-green color of Ptolemaic glass was most probably achieved by the addition of copper compounds as coloring agent(s) rather than the cobalt of earlier periods or the iron of later periods (Lucas and Harris 1962: 188-89). Metal On the whole, metal objects were fewer and less well preserved at Kom Hadid than at Kom Ge'if, perhaps due to the height of the present water table at Hadid. Five copper coins were retrieved (from Loci 6202, 6305, 7606, 7608, and 7613), but heavy corrosion and other metal disease(s) had com? pletely removed their original surfaces and they could not be identified even after meticulous cleaning and stabilization by conservator Weber. Short pins in copper or copper alloy (from Loci 7603 and 7606) and an iron pin with a copper(?) head (from Locus 7613) were also found. Iron nails (also very corroded) that had been so prevalent at Kom Ge'if were encountered in only two deposits at Kom Hadid (Loci 6205 and 7603). Several small and indistinguishable lumps of copper/bronze were re? corded elsewhere (Loci 6203, 6207, 6209, 7618, and 13002). Plaster Two-dimensional During his tenure at Naukratis, Petrie noted "frescoed Roman brickwork" in association with the slag heaps at Kom Hadid (references in Coulson and Leonard 1982: 363); and Hogarth encoun? tered traces of several floors of "hammered earth overlaid with fine plaster" (1898/99: 33) that had been decorated in a variety of colors of which he noted crimson, brilliant blue, and yellow. These colors occurred in both solid and striped patterns. Small, fragmentary bits of decorative plaster, also in very poor condition, were encountered in many of the archaeological deposits during our work at Kom Hadid; those that were large or distinctive enough to be registered separately are discussed below. Unfortunately, their secondary archaeological contexts do not allow us to comment on whether they had originally been used to decorate walls, floors, or even ceilings. However, the impressions of chaff and other vegetal matter on the backs of #74 and #79 could suggest that some were originally part of a floor (from a second story?), while the beveled imitation of drafted-margin orthostats of #76 suggest that other pieces had originally been part of a wall decoration. Material. Samples of plaster from both Kom Ge'if and Kom Hadid were tested for composition on a random basis by conservator Gail Weber. She found that over 90% ofthe pieces represented lime</page><page sequence="222">206 Albert Leonard, Jr. AASOR 5 5 plaster (calcium carbonate, CaC03) and that none of them could be proven to be gypsum (calcium sul- phate, CaS04). In fact, Weber noted that the two samples that did not react to hydrochloric acid were definitely not calcined gypsum. At first, this might seem strange, given Egypt's long history of using decorated gypsum plaster to embellish the walls of its buildings and tombs (Lucas and Harris 1999: 76), and the bountiful supplies of gypsum that occur naturally in the Mariout region to the west of Alexandria (Lucas and Harris 1999: 78, with references). Furthermore, the temperatures required to produce a plaster from gypsum (c. 130?C) is only about 15% of that which is needed to obtain a sim? ilar product from limestone (c. 900?C). The production of lime plaster in the western Delta, an area in which trees have always been a scarce commodity, would have required a substantial amount of fuel. The Delta potters of the Ptolemaic Period, however, never seem to have had trouble finding a sufficient supply of fuel to fire the huge quantity of pottery that they produced, a fact that was espe? cially apparent at Kom Hadid whose surface was carpeted with kiln waste and furnace product, the material that had been identified by Petrie as metal slag. Today, in the modern village of Kom Ge'if, the collection of dung is a major industry and an absolutely essential task if even a minimum level of sanitation is to be maintained. The material thus collected is formed into patties and air dried for later use as for building materials and fuel (see also Miller 1984, Miller and Smart 1984). Viewed in such a context the consumption of large amounts of fuel by the Ptolemaic lime slakers was probably just as important to the life of the community as was the work of the potters. Because the use of lime plaster, which appears to have several distinct advantages over gypsum plaster, cannot be documented before the Ptolemaic Period, it is thought by many to have been a Greek practice that was introduced to Egypt in the wake of Alexander's conquest. Evidently, if the new technique was good enough for the builders of the new capital, it would have been sought after by the citizens of Naukratis who for centuries had considered their city to have been the only Hel- lenic presence in the country. Technique. Several of the plaster fragments from Kom Hadid include preparatory layers (i.e., mul? tiple layers or coats of plaster placed one upon the other). Some of these represent base (or buildup) layers of coarse plaster that had been smoothed in preparation for a final finish (or face) coat. Other fragments, however, give clear indication of distinct phases of decorating or redecorating. In the latter instances a finished and decorated surface had been covered by another coat of coarse plaster and then given a second finish coat that would have been subsequently painted with a new design. The most com? plex fragment from Hadid is #69 (pl. 3.37; fig. 3.11:C), which preserves five distinct layers that include oo two face coats. In every case where multiple layers are present, there is a noticeable increase in the quality and fineness of the plaster from the base coat(s) to the face coat, with decreasing amounts of temper in the plaster as one moves towards the face coat. Examining this material under magnification, conser? vator Weber noted the presence of charcoal as well as "sand and gravel of a fluvial origin" in these sub- strata. Quite often the river gravel was large enough to be seen by the unaided eye and occasionally larger lithic inclusions (c. 1.0-1.5 cm) were also encountered. In addition to the grit-temper, the lay? ers of undercoating also contained bits of grog (ground potsherds and fired brick) which, according to both Pliny and Vitruvius, was especially desirable in buildings situated in damp locations (Ling 1976: 212). The proximity of Naukratis to the Nile canal would seem to support their views. Although the reddish grog was usually confined to the basal layers, a sufficient amount of the material had occasion? ally been mixed into the face coat(s) to give them a distinctly pinkish hue.</page><page sequence="223">1998 Miscellaneous Material Culture 207 As noted above, the finished surface (or face coat) of each fragment was always the finest (least tempered) of the preparatory layers and could exhibit smoothing, painting, and/or sculpting (see Pratt 1976:227): 1. The surface could simply be smoothed, evidently with a board (or "float") in the same manner as a modern mason would finish a cement slab; 2. The surface could be painted, either solid monochrome or in decorative patterns such as vegetal garlands (#67) or the veining of marble (#70). According to conservator Weber, the colors of the Kom Hadid fragments (see Table 3.1) had been applied when the surface was dry (al secco) rather than when it was still wet (alfrescd), 3. The plaster could be sculpted while it was still wet in order to give the surface the three-dimensional appearance of blocks with drafted margins (#76) or other elements of an architectural facade (#83). String courses representing marginally drafted blocks of stone (in both solid colors and faux mar? ble), articulated by means of lines inscribed in the plaster as well as by color separation, strongly link the Kom Hadid fragments with other structures decorated in the so-called Masonry Style. The presence of similar Masonry Style decoration on at least one of the walls of the Wardian Tomb in nearby Alex? andria suggests an approximate date of the second century B.C, and we know from the ruins at Pompeii that the popularity of the style extended into the first century B.C. (Laidlaw 1985). In discuss? ing the fragments of painted (al secco), lime-plaster from the walls of Herod's Palace at Jericho, Rozenberg (1966: 123-25, and 128) noted several differences between the decorated walls of the Hasmonean/ Hellenistic Period and those that had been executed after the beginning of Herod's building activity in the region (i.e., shortly after c. 30 B.C.). These differences included the fact that 1. Hellenistic (pre-Herodian) paintings had fewer layers of plaster, since fewer layers would be required when painting al secco as opposed to al fresco where the pigment is applied directly to the surface of the rapidly drying wall; 2. linear patterns were less regular in Hasmonean than in Herodian work; 3. relief devices of incised or inscribed lines and beveled features (as well as molded architectonic elements such as #83 to be discussed below) that had been so common in Hasmonean and other Hellenistic buildings did not continue their popularity in the Herodian period. These features are also to be found in the plaster fragments from Kom Hadid and combine with other evidence at the site to reinforce a date for them in the second-first century B.C, sometime before Augustus incorporated Egypt into the Roman orb.

Fragment of architectural relief9 (pl. 3.42 and fig. 3.13) Locus 7605 N.III.76.53 MC#111 Preservation: 5.8 x 4.0 x 2.6 cm. Description: Fragmentary crown molding with ovolo, decorated with egg-and-dart motive, in which the dart appears to be abnormally isolated from the eggs. The molding was constructed in two stages: a coarse inner layer of plaster (indicated by stippling on the drawing) was first applied to the wall; this was followed by a finer, whiter face coat of plaster that bore the three-dimensional decoration. The upper surface of both layers of plaster appears to have been flattened as if it had been shaped against a firm surface (a wooden form or a previously dried, plaster surface?). Because of its fragmentary condition, this molding is difficult to understand. Even its original stance cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty, and a change in the stance would obviously bring about a corresponding change in the profile. Therefore, for the sake of presentation, two stances are offered here (fig. 3.13): 1. Stance A that treats the fragment as a more canonical crown molding; 2. Stance B that presents a less typical profile, but one that takes into consideration the (apparently) flattened upper surfaces of the two layers of plaster. Date: 2nd century-first half of lst century B.C Discussion: Among the moldings presented by Shoe, the closest parallel for the profile of the Kom Hadid fragment, as presented in Stance A, is a sixth century B.C. ovolo in terracotta from Miletus (1936: 13, and pl. 111:10). This belongs to her Ovolo Type IC (with the bottom deeper than the top), the same group to which she has assigned the epistyle crown from the first Temple of Apollo at Nau-</page><page sequence="231">1998 Miscellaneous Material Culture 215 Stance A Stance B Face i?i i?i Fig 3.13. Three-dimensional architectural relief in plaster (# 83). kratis (Shoe 1936: 13, and pl. 111:2). There are also similarities between it and the profile ofthe ovolo on the crown ofthe altar on the south frieze ofthe later sixth century B.C. Siphnian Treasury at Delphi (Shoe 1936: 15-16, and pl. VI: 12) which she assigned to her Ovolo Type IE (oval) category that also included the epistyle crown from the later temple of Apollo at Naukratis (Shoe 1936: 17, and pl.VI:l4).98 The closest parallel for the profile of the piece as presented in Stance B, comes from the epistyle of the West Agora Gate at Ephesus, a structure that is dated to the end of the second century B.C. In dis- cussing this piece Shoe remarked that, in the original publication, the chief molding on this structure had been identified by the excavators as an ovolo, but that there was no doubt in her mind that it should be considered to be a cyma reversa (1936: 63, and pl. XXVIIL31, her Cyma Reversa IV) and, in fact, it does seem to represent a rather hybrid creation. Three-dimensional, architectural moldings in sculpted plaster also occur at Jericho in a variety of profiles that appear to have come from the upper portion of the walls, since some of the fragments even displayed the impression of reeds and other wooden elements of the structure. According to Rozen- berg, the most commonly appearing features were variations on the egg-and-dart pattern of which she illustrates several (1996: 126 and figs. 22-23). These closely resemble the fragment from Kom Hadid. In addition to Jericho, she also noted similar pieces of egg and tongue at Cypros, Herodion and Mas- ada, as well as at Hellenistic sites such as Tel Anafa (1996: 126, and note 28, 29 with references). Weinberg (1971: 97-98) has published an elaborate egg-and-dart molded border from Tel Anafa that he assigned to the second phase of architecture at the site, the end of second century and first half of the first century B.C. Such a date would be very much in keeping with Rozenberg's suggestion that "the local Hellenistic tradition of using molded architectonic elements as the most important part of the decoration had already gone out of use" by the time of Herod's elaborate building program (1996: 128); and it would also agree with the floruit of the representation of marginally drafted blocks of stone through the use of inscribed lines. In summary then, while with Stance A we may be morphologically closer to sixth century B.C. Ionic forms that actually existed in limestone at Naukratis, with Stance B we are nearer to structures</page><page sequence="232">216 Albert Leonard, Jr. AASOR 5 5 that are closer, chronologically, to the majority of the pottery and other elements of material culture that have been excavated at Kom Hadid. It is not impossible that the earlier pieces of sculpted stone may still have been visible to, and have served as the model or inspiration for, a Hellenistic artist attempting to duplicate them from plaster in the Masonry Style, the fashionable medium of the day. Notes The author wishes to thank Dr. Irene Bald Romano for her helpful comments (based on photographs) on many of these figurines and plaques, and for directing the author to many very useful references. Errors and omissions are, of course, the author's. For coroplastic material found at Naukratis that is illus- trative of the ancient Greek theater, see the following works by Webster. For tragedy and satyr plays: a terracotta mask (male?): ET7 (Webster: 1967: 66, cf. Gutch 1898/99: 96, no. 322); the terracotta head of a satyr figurine: ET16 (Web? ster: 1967: 67 [= B.M. C638]); and two satyr heads from clay braziers: AV50 and AV51 (Webster 1967: 53; cf. Conze 1890: 130, no. 814, 816 [= B.M. C889 and C891]); For Old and Middle Comedy: a terracotta (male?) mask: AT120, possibly of Attic fabric (Webster 1969b: 127, 221 = Webster 1969a: 100, UT12); and New Comedy: a terracotta mask of a young man: ETll (Webster 1969a: 103); terracotta heads of male slaves: ET41, ET42, ET 43, and possibly ET 44 (Webster 1969a: 107-8 [cf. Petrie 1886: fig. 14, pl. 15]; and Walters 1903: cat. no. 261). For other terracotta figurines from Naukratis, in addi? tion to those published by Petrie (1886), Gardner (1888), and Gutch (1898/99), see also Higgins (1969: 404-7) for nine pieces in the British Museum (nos. 1542-1550) that, for the most part, predate the material presented here, and Dunand (1990: 74-75 [no. 142] and 108 [no.252]). It is un- fortunate, but understandable, that Gutch illustrated only about twenty percent of the figures with which he dealt. The fabric that is here referred to as "Delta silt" is the same material that very often in the past has been referred to as "Nile mud." Cf. Higgins 1967: 56, 93. 5 Much of the basis for Webster's classification, however, was based on vagaries of hair and beard styles. These features, unfortunately, are not preserved on the Naukratis piece. In this respect, the mask resembles the faces of Ba'al that were associated with earlier Canaanite and Punic cults. Cf. Yadin 1970: 221-22 and fig. 14; Bieber 1961b: 11, figs. 66- 69; and Karageorghis 1993:107 (seventh-fourth century B.C.). For (both tragic and comic) masks and masked actors from the Alexandrian cemeteries, cf. Breccia 1930: 63-65. For a grotesque with sidelock and lotus-bud crown car? rying the infant Harpocrates, cf. Perdrizet 1921: 114, no. 292. 8Thompson et al. 1987; 45, no. 17; Breccia 1912: 137- 38, pl. LXXL212; Adriani 1961: 19 (inv. no. 25747), pl. VIII:5); Higgins 1967: 102, pl. 43E; Bell 1981: 190-94 nos. 484-534, 166 nos. 283, 285; Schurmann 1989: 312, 314, 319, nos. 1172, 1173, 1180-81, pls. 196-98; and Breccia 1930: 82, Tav. XIII:8. 9Higgins 1986: 123. For Harpocrates with a similar wreath (but without his finger in his mouth), cf. Bayer-Niemeyer 1988: 145, no. 168, Taf. 34:4. Such wreaths, however, usually culminate in a miniature Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, an ele? ment that cannot be confirmed on the Naukratis piece since the top of the figure is abraded. Comparable human/divine female figurines exhibiting surplus bits of clay around the mouth or at lips, include inter alia, Bell 1981: 182, 184; Schurmann 1989: 242-43, no. 909, 914, Taf. 150, 151. Related are figures shown in the same pose, but where the subject wears platform shoes of varying height, usually with an anklet on each leg: Laumonier 1956: 152-53, nos. 441-44, pl. 43. 13Perdrizet 1921: 83-86, and the figure of no. 199 on p. 85. Also generically similar, but probably not related, are the curls of hair on a herm from Athens (invert the Naukratis fragment; Thompson, et al. 1987: 434; cf. pl. 58, T1566), the protrusions on a fragment of a thorn kantharos from sec? ond century B.C. Corinth (Edwards 1975." 87-88, pl. 54 no. 524, page 87 n. 82 references a similar piece in the contem? porary Chatby cemetery in Alexandria), or the pyramidal bosses (termed bosettes by Courby 1922: 334, 386) on some imprecate bowls (Edwards 1975:157-58 pl. 65 no. 783), but note the similarities between the pyramidal bosses on a pine cone vessel (no. 1375) and the slightly rounder bosses on the bunch of grapes (no. 1376) published side-by-side in Laumo? nier (1956: 284, pl. 102). The piece does not, however, find ready parallels among the large group of Hellenistic molds from the Athenian Agora (Grandjouan et al. 1989). For a visual impression of the high quality of these pieces, see the equally well-finished Bes in Dunand (1990: 21, no. 34 [color]). If the Naukratus fragment is inverted, there are some similarities between it and the sides of some plaques showing Harpocrates leaning against a column(?). Cf. inter alia, Bayer- Niemeyer (1988: 94, no. 100, Taf. 20:1 etc). The first attempt to classify the Greco-Roman lamps of Egypt was made by Petrie 1905 based primarily on the tremendous number of lamps found during his excavations at Ehnasya (Herakleopolis Magna). Subsequent schemes have</page><page sequence="233">1998 Miscellaneous Material Culture 217 been presented by Osborne 1924, Robins 1939a and b, and recently Daszewski 1987, the last of which has been the most useful to this study. Excellent discussions of the development of the various types of lamps are given by Bailey 1975 in con? nection with the examples in the British Museum, and by Hayes 1980b in his discussion of the lamps in the Royal Ontario Museum. Although it has been noted that, at least during the Hellenistic period, Egyptian lamp production was more influenced by events and trends in the eastern Aegean and eastern Mediterranean (Shier 1978), the corporaoi lamps from the Athenian Agora (Howland 1958), Corinth (Broneer 1930), and Isthmia (Broneer 1977) remain indispensable to any study of the form. Also exceedingly valuable is the treat? ment by Shier 1978 of the lamps from the site of Karanis in the Egyptian Fayoum. The collections of the British Museum have several wheelmade lamps that are said (or believed) to come from Naukratis. See Bailey 1975 Volume I: Q20, Q22, Q52, Q81, and Q90 (from Athens ?); Q147, Q150, Q152-Q154 (from Ephessos and/or Southern Ionia); and Q365-Q370 (from Rhodes?). Lamps numbered Q513, Q524, Q533, Q537, and Q539, also found at Naukratis, appear to be wheelmade, local (i.e. Egyptian) lamps that follow non-Egyptian proto- types. For these lamps Bailey offers earlier (and/or) original publication(s). On lamps from Naukratis, cf. also Shier (1978: 4 with n. 33, 21 with n. 172, 32 with n. 279, and 40). The Egyptian lamps, however, are also very similar in style to lamps of the moldmade Agora Type 29 (A and B), which Howland considered to be related to the wheelmade Type 25 (1958:94). A case might also be made for including the Naukratis lamp with the wheelmade poor relations of Howland Type 33A (1958: 101; see also Bruneau 1965: 26, nos. 275-87, pl. 5, and Michelucci 1975: 24, no. 32 [his type VIII], pl. III). Note also similarities with Thompson's Type A4l, which he noted was one of the two most popular lamp types in the Chatby Cemetery at Alexandria, and was most probably the type of lamp that many of the earliest settlers must have car? ried with them to the new commercial center (Thompson etal. 1987:22-23, fig. 7: A41). Several moldmade lamps of Egyptian fabric are in the collections of the British Museum (cf. Bailey 1975: Q555, Q558, Q566bis, Q574, Q580, Q594, Q609, and Q618). Howland (1958: 143) also calls attention to the fact that the lamp type is similar to Tarsus Group IV lamps (Gold? man 1950: 89), which are dated to the end of the third and the beginning of the second centuries B.C. Hayes (1980a: 19) isolated four major wares/fabrics in the Ptolemaic moldmade lamps in the collections of the Royal Ontario Museum the first of which, a non-micaceous buff clay, he assigned to Alexandria. Most of the lamps from Naukratis would fall into his categories 3 and 4. The author wishes to thank Andrea Berlin and Mark Lawall for discussing many of the following pieces with him either in person and/or in correspondence. Their help was in- valuable and their suggestions were heeded in most cases. However, the author bears full responsibility for any errors that appear here. The author is aware of the difficulties in (and vagaries of) creating and comparing categories of pottery through the use of Munsell colors (different people on different days un? der different lighting conditions; but the fact that the present author personally Munselled every sherd excavated at both Kom Ge'if and Kom Hadid (as well as the stamped handles published by Rehard in Coulson 1996) in indirect sunlight at approximately the same time of day for three seasons, should solve some of the potential problems. In any case, the advan- tages of using the Munsell Chart certainly do more than out- weigh the pitfalls of reporting through such color descriptors as beige and fawn. For the importance of adding the exami- nation of the fabric to other methods of studying amphorae see, inter alia, Peacock 1977, and the excellent section by Pea? cock in Sealey 1985: 153-66. In retrospect, this study should have contained a petrological component, but only a limited amount of material was allowed out of Egypt for study, and we simply did not have the resources to conduct such studies in the field. It should be noted that the band of red paint is not an exclusively Rhodian embellishment but can also appear on amphorae from Chios, Clazomenae and elsewhere (Coulson 1996: 47, n. 171 with references to Dupont 1982). Lawall of? fers the caveat that the traces of red paint may be less related to the manufacturing process and more to the packing and re- tailing process (personal communication). See also the similar profile of two amphorae attributed to a Rhodian manufacturer by Grace (1934: 306, pl. 11:4 and 5). Note that she had somewhat modified her third century B.C. date for these pieces after that plate had been made. Coulson (1996: 63) saw a decline in the importation of am? phorae from Rhodes and other (presumably Greek) cities in the first century B.C. that he felt reflected the growing Roman intervention in the Aegean area during that time. Such a groove appears on some pseudo-Koan amphorae from Cyprus (Hayes 1991: 86 [no. 16], and fig. 37:2), but it is uncertain whether or not these features carried any typo? logical or chronological significance. There is also some simi? larity between the grooved rim of the vessels illustrated on figs. 3.2:11 and 12 with the rim of the Gauloise 5 amphora (Peacock and Williams 1986: 148 [their Class 30]) that ap? pears in the second half of the 1st century A.D., but the necks of these later forms are much shorter than the Kom Hadid pieces. Coulson would date these pieces as late as the second century A.D. on the basis of unpublished material from the Athenian Agora (1996: 51, and fig. 24). Peacock and Williams assign the Dressel 20 amphora to their Class 25 which also includes Beltran V, Ostia I, and Cal- lender 2 (1986: 136-40, and especially the evolutionary chart on fig. 65). Note that the form does reach the markets of the eastern Mediterranean (especially) during the early Empire period (1986: 136; with references to Riley and to Will).</page><page sequence="234">218 Albert Leonard, Jr. AASOR 5 5 The Oberaden 83 is grouped by Peacock and Williams (along with Haltern 71 and Dressel 25) in their Class 24 (1986: 134-35). Note, however, the profile on some of the Cam 184 amphorae at Colchester Sheepen (Sealey 1985: figs. 6:50 and 7:63). At least one of the fabric variants of the Cam 184 has been attributed to Rhodes (Sealey 1985: 51, 55-56) and it is believed to have evolved "from its Hellenistic pre- decessors by the late first century A.D." (1985: 56, citing V Grace). At least two of the Dressel 2-4 fabrics have been attrib? uted to Rhodes, but the other five are still unassigned to a spe? cific area. In addition to Rhodes, derivatives of "Koan" Dressel 2-4 (Class 10) amphorae, complete with bead rim and dou- ble-barreled handle, were made at a minimum of seven ateliers in the eastern Mediterranean including Cos, Knidos, and even the Lac Mariout district behind Alexandria (Empereur and Pi- con 1989: 225-31 [with references] and figs. 2-4b). The author also sees a similar, embryonic concavity of the inner profile of the rim on Peacock and Williams' Class I amphorae (1986: 82-83) that includes examples of the Brindisi amphora and the Ostia LXVI. Examples of this type, which can occur in a 5YR 7/6 (Reddish Yellow)?7.5YR 7/4 (Pink) fabric similar to some of the Kom Hadid vessels, were widely distributed in the eastern Mediterranean region from the late second century B.C. to the mid-first century B.C. Andrea Berlin, however, suggests (personal communi? cation) that a Rhodian or even a Cypriot origin for these pieces cannot be excluded. On Cypriot amphorae and their distribution, see Calvet 1986. Coulson's description of the fabric as "almost uniformly yellowish red . . . and the slip a creamy white color" (1996: 47) is not unlike the fabric of the Hadid examples. Their Class 9 amphorae includes forms known under other terms: Rhodian Type, Ostia LXV, Camulodunum 184, and Callender 7 (Peacock and Williams 1986: 102). Several similar rims identified as Koan were encountered by Coulson during the Naukratis Survey (1996: 47-49, and fig. 23). Morphological similarities also exist between the present fig. 3.2:7 and chronologically earlier rims attributed to an atelier on Chios (Grace 1934: 301-302, pl. II.l). In other systems, Peacock and Williams' Class 10 am? phorae may appear as "Koan Type" (from the bifed handles), Dressel 2-4, Ostia Ll, Camulodunum 182-183, Callender 2, and Benghazi ER amphora 4 (1986: 105). These rounded rims from Kom Hadid also share similarities with Peacock and Williams' slightly later (first-second century A.D.) Class II or "pseudo-Koan" amphorae of unknown origin but which share the bifed handles (1986: 107-8). For a detailed discus? sion of the typology of the Dressel 2-4 amphora, see Farinas del Cerro et al. 1977; and for the problem of differentiating the origins, especially of "Rhodian" (Dressel 2-4) amphorae, see Peacock (1977: especially 266-70). Compare, however, the rim profiles of imitation (?) Koan amphorae from Paphos (Cyprus) complete with bifed handles (Hayes 1991: 86, and fig. 37:1), and the internally bevelled rims of Naukratis Survey no. 1484 (Type G2) and no. 826 (Type F ) also said to be of Koan inspiration (Coul? son 1996: 47 and fig. 23). It should be noted that both A. Berlin and M. Lawall (personal communication) question whether the sherd is cor- rectly drawn. For the subdivisions of the Dressel 1 and the makeup of their Classes 3 through 6, see Peacock and Williams (1986: 86-95). 431986: 117-19. Their Class 16 also includes Dressel 7- 11, Beltran I, and Paunier 435. Their Class 17 which also in? cluded some examples of Beltrdn I (and was traded at least far east as Benghazi) is morphologically similar in concept, but it is much more attenuated than examples of Class 16 and the Kom Hadid piece (Peacock and Williams 1986: 120-21). See also the series of forms from Cerro de los Martires in southern Spain (Lloris 1997: 105-6, figs. 4-10); and those published as Dressel 7-13 from Luni by Siena (1977: 213-14, and figs. 18-19). 1986: 126-27. Class 20 also included pieces assigned to Dressel 14, Beltran IVA, and Ostia LXII categories. Their Class 2 is said to include those amphorae also termed Republicaine 1 and Lamboglia 4 (1986: 84-85). Will does cite, however, two vessels in the British Mu? seum that may have originated in a Near Eastern context (1982: 343). Grace also mentions similar pieces in the British Museum (1971: 55-56, and 88). The small ridge(s) below the point of greatest diameter on these pieces is also seen on a rim from Paphos (Hayes 1991: fig. 38:7, not discussed in text?). See also Coulson's Type U2, nos. 1035 and 1042 (1986: 50, and fig. 24) from the Naukratis Survey. See Panella and Fano 1977 for a classification of the amphora with bifed handles found at Pompeii. Lawall, however, does not think that a Rhodian origin for 3.3:14 is likely (personal communication). At Naukratis it was very often difficult to gain a correct impression of the original shape of the toes/spikes since they had suffered so much from chipping and breakage. See, for instance, the amphorae identified as Mendean derivatives from the Naukratis Survey (Coulson 1996: 58 and fig. 29). Note the ridge on the stem of fig. 3.4-3, possibly a Cyp? riot feature, also appears on a toe from the Naukratis Survey (Coulson 1996: 58 and fig. 29:436). Coulson's method of distinguishing the chronology of his pieces by the degree to which the hollow interior of the vessel protrudes into the toe does not seem to be internally consistent (1996: 54-55 and fig. 27), and does not work with the Kom Hadid examples. At Paphos note the similarities of the Chian related and imitation Koan toes to the Hadid pieces (Hayes 1991: 86, no. 15, fig. 37:4, and no. 17, fig. 37:2). 5 Possibly related is a toe from Paphos thought to be Cyp? riot fabric (Hayes 1991: 95 no. 45, and fig. 37:8).

On the corpus of similar pieces from Samaria, Reisner stated, "Nearly all the forms were clearly imitations of the black-glazed or of other Greek and Hellenistic pottery ves? sels" (1924: 326). 70Cf. from Samaria, Reisner (1924: 327, nos. 13a, 14a, and 15a). Compare from Corinth, Edwards (1975: 30 note 14, and 211), and Romano (1994: 97, nos. 115 and 116, pl. 31), and from Samaria, Reisner (1924: 327, no. 3392, fig. 12a). Compare From Samaria, Reisner (1924: 327, nos. 13a, 15a, and 16a). Plate 3:23 contains a second sherd (23a) that was not drawn in the field. It is assumed that both pieces come from the same vessel since they were excavated and put in the same pottery bag. For the "Mycenaean Flower" motive, see Furumark (1941: 284-98) and Mountjoy (1986: 68-69). For the pop? ularity of vessels decorated with this motive (FM 18), see Le? onard (1994: 152-54). For stirrup jars in faience, see Foster (1979). A similar stand in faience in the Harper Family Trust Collection is dated to the Third Intermediate Period (715 B.C; Scott 1992: 23, no. 7). In addition to the two pieces presented here as #64a and #64b, similar pieces of stone were found in the following de- posits: Locus 13001 (N.III.130.01, MC#1): a small piece of white, coarse-grained marble; Locus 6301 (N.III.63.02, MC#1): several pieces of marble(?), including one piece that had been blackened secondarily by fire (evidence for Pet? rie's lime-slaking activity in the area?); and Locus 6302 (N.III.63.06, MC#13a): two small pieces of gray-white marble (1.3 cm and 2.0 cm thick respectively). 77 Similar fragments of pavement were encountered in neighboring Locus 7613 (N.III.76.70, MC#144), and Locus 7618 (N.III.76.64, MC#155, and N.III.76.74, MC#156). This last fragment (MC#156) contained a single (honey- colored) pebble that was identified as alabaster by conservator Weber. 78See, inter alia, Fischer 1971, Neal 1976, and Sear 1976. 7 Phillips 1960: 243-45. Is his phrase "irregularly shaved pieces" a typographical error for "irregularly shaped pieces" of stone (1960: 244)? For background on this topic see also Blake (1930) and Levi (1947). For the description of fourteen different grades of opus signinum in a single villa, along with the type(s) of weight and trafflc that each might carry and the possible function of the areas of which they were a part (most dating to the first cen? tury B.C), see Cotton and Metraux (1985: 87-88, 123-25, and 127-28). Note that Dunbabin distinguishes between surfaces whose inclusions are mixed throughout the pavement layer and those where they are set into the pavement to form a sur? face of adjoining pieces (1994: 36). The Kom Hadid pave? ment actually seem to have been executed in a manner that combines these two techniques. The later Roman glass from the site of Karanis in the Fayoum Oasis has been fully published by Harden (1936) but, unfortunately, there are no parallels to the Kom Hadid piece. 83 Hogarth 1898-1899: 33, Rooms 11, 19, and 20; and von Bissing 1951: 52, 75. The present author understands the term lime plaster to represent calcium carbonate (Q1CO3). Note that, in discuss? ing the antecedents of related stuccowork of Roman date, Ling (1976: 209) differentiates between plaster made from gypsum and that made from lime (meaning calcium oxide, CaO). However, he does discuss the process by which the cal? cium oxide (CaO) is turned back into calcium carbonate (CaC03) in a form that can then be used by the builder or decorator. On this topic see also Ling (1972: 23-25). 85 Following Lucas and Harris (1999: 78-79). During his tenure at Naukratis Petrie believed that he had found evidence of post-Roman, lime-slaking activity in the area of his Great Temenos by which means he believed the Ptolemaic entryway to that structure had finally been destroyed (1886: 9, 34). Our project never found support? ing evidence for this event, although a small piece of marble with traces of secondary burning was excavated in Locus 6301. 87Ling (1972: 24), referencing Harris and Lucas (1999: 74-78.)</page><page sequence="236">220 Albert Leonard, Jr. AASOR 55 88 For both Pliny and Vitruvius the number and compo? sition of the substrata were, in theory, an important and com- plicated matter but, in practice, it seems that many builders felt at liberty to take short cuts and to reduce the number and complexity of these layers. (See Ling 1976: 213-14). 89The colors preserved on the Kom Hadid fragments compare well with the reds, green/grays and other colors of the garlands and decorative features including faux marble in the second century B.C. Wardian Tomb in nearby Alexandria (Venit 1988). 90 Munsell descriptors are presented with the appropriate entry in the Locus Summaries. The red and reddish brown pigments were thought by Weber to have been derived from ocher. Analysis of the other colors was not attempted. For the range of pigment options available to the Ptolemaic craftsmen, see Lucas and Harris (1989: 338-51), and Pratt (1976: 224-27). For the method of application of the paint to walls of the Roman period, see now the results of the work conducted by the Istituto Centrale delV Restauro in Rome described by Pratt (1976: 227-29). This style has been knowned by a number of names, inter alia, Pompeian First Style, Romano-Campanian First Style, Encrustation Style, Structural Style, and Greek Ma? sonry Style. For a discussion on the origin(s) of the style, see Bruno (1989) and Laidlaw (1985). Venit 1988: 78, and fig. 11. References to similar string courses in the House of the Tritons on Delos are referenced in n. 20. Rozenberg follows Netzer's dates (1975: 93 and n. 18) that are slightly lower than that proposed by the original excavators of the site (Kelso and Baramki 1955: 1-49). Since Herod was a staunch ally of Marc Antony and Cleopatra, and subsequently also of Octavian/Augustus, the Hasmonean pe? riod in Egyptian terms can be equated with the last half of the Ptolemaic Period. 95 The representation of string courses on the plaster walls of Alexandrian tombs go back to the third century B.C. (Venit 1988: 89 and especially n. 68). Fragments of architectural sculpture in both lime? stone and marble were found during the early excavations at Naukratis, most of which are presently in the British Mu? seum. These fragments were assembled and discussed primar? ily by Pryce (1928: 170-79, the first [limestone] temple of Apollo [B 391-B 404]; the second [marble] temple of Apollo [B 405-B 4330]; and a few miscellaneous blocks [B 434-B 436]). See also Shoe (1936: 12-13, 47, 153-55, 171-72, and 180). Gardner recorded finding "a piece of egg-molding in limestone, probably from the earliest temple of Hera, but its forms (were) not remarkable enough to be worth detailed de? scription" (Gardner 1888: 61). Nor, evidently, did he con- sider it to have been worth illustrating. The piece from the Hera temple does not appear to be any of those discussed by Pryce. 97This piece is British Museum B 47 (Pryce 1928: 174 and fig. 13). 98This piece is British Museum B 409 (Pryce 1928: 176). The suggested similarities between the plaster fragment from Naukratis and the epistyle from Ephesus are confined to the upper portion of the molding. 100A doctoral dissertation on the Tel Anafa wall decora? tion was completed by Robert Gordon under the direction of Saul Weinberg (Gordon 1977).</page><page sequence="237">Appendix 1: Field Pottery Fabric Types Albert Leonard, Jr. How much further can the process of parceling out the motley fabrics of Naukratis among her equally motley population be carried? ?H. L. Lorrimer, Naukratis 1903 The Fabrics Although a small number of imported sherds were found during our four seasons of excavation, the vast percentage of the ceramic material represented plainer wares, the majority of which are con? sidered to have been of relatively local production. The amount of well-excavated and well-published comparative material for the pottery that we excavated at Kom Ge'if was quite limited during the years that we were in the field. It therefore was considered best to register this pottery according to a number of individual fabric types, with the understanding that the divisions and differences between them may not always have been intentional or desired. These fabrics, however, formed the basis for all work on the pottery during our seasons at Naukratis and they are included in the present publica? tion in the hopes that our material might be assimilated more easily into corpora of pottery from other sites in the Nile Delta and beyond. The plain wares from Naukratis, presented below, can readily be divided into two subgroups: those predominantly tempered with mineral inclusions, and those tempered with organic matter. The mineral-tempered fabrics, discussed first, appear to be a basically homogeneous group with minor, internal variations such as the presence or absence of a slip and/or color variants that were presumably the result of differences in kiln temperatures or other vagaries of the manufacturing process. Following discussions with Mike Rodziewicz, and later with Andrea Berlin, however, it seemed best to discuss the pottery in the final publication according to the recognized terminology of the 1990s. Through resource to photos, fabric descriptions, and actual samples, the following correlations between our field fabrics and the more recent terminology were made, but it was felt that a great deal of information would be lost if the details of our original groupings were not presented. Note that in the captions to the pottery drawings both sets of information are included, for instance: "Delta silt (IA)" is the fabric recorded in the field as Fabric IA (Mineral-tempered Red Ware: with a Red Slip). Such a fabric, however, is now more recognizeable to many scholars simply as Delta Silt. Imports, local amphorae, and sherds that did not fit readily into one of these specific fabrics were given a more formal and specific description, and these are included in the captions to the figures. Delta Silt Fabrics Field Fabric l Plain Mineral-tempered Red Ware. This fabric consisted of a well-levigated clay, which in its basic version was unslipped. The core ranges from 7.5YR 4/2 (Weak Red) to 10R 5/8 (Red) below a surface generally in the range of 7.5R 5/6 (Red) or 10R 5/4 (Weak Red). Temper consisted of finely ground 221</page><page sequence="238">222 Appendix 1 AASOR 55 (sand-sized to 1 mm) white, gray and red grit with the white being the predominant material. Mica? ceous inclusions of similar size were also quite frequent. All the vessels in this fabric were wheel? made with deep finger corrugation frequently visible on the interior of the vessel, while the exteriors of many vessels were scored by the potter's fingernails. Field Fabric IA Mineral-tempered Red Ware, with Red Slip. On some (predominantly the open) forms of this variant, a 7.5YR 4/6 (Red) to 3/6 (Dark Red) slip had been added. This slip had often been bur? nished while it was still turning on the wheel in 1 to 2 mm wide horizontal bands, usually spaced from 1 to 1.5 cm apart. A preference to restrict the slip to the upper portions of the vessel was noted on the exterior of many pieces, and the slip was often allowed to drip down the sides in an irregular pattern. Field Fabric IB Mineral-tempered Red Ware, with Orange Slip. The fabric of this subtype was also similar to that of the main fabric with the addition of an orange slip between 10R 6/8 (Light Red) and 5/8 (Red). In some instances the slip appeared to have been used to completely cover the interior and/or exte? rior of the vessel, while in other examples it has been applied decoratively in a band on the upper surface of the vessel or allowed to drip down the sides of the vase. Randomly spaced wheel-burnishing was frequently noted on this fabric. Field Fabric IC Mineral-tempered Red Ware, with White Painted Band(s). This subtype was recognized in only one example (Leonard in Coulson and Leonard 1981a: fig. 8:30). Its fabric is similar to that of the main type, but the exterior surface had been decorated with an undulating band of 7.5YR 8/2 (Pinkish White) paint. Field Fabric ID Mineral-tempered Red Ware, with Red Painted (Bands). This subtype is definitely a variant of the main type but with the addition of a painted band of 7.5YR 5/2-4/2 (Weak Red) or 10R 4/4 (Weak Red) wash(?). Field Fabric IE Mineral-tempered Red Ware, with Painted Designs. A variant of the main Mineral Tempered Red Ware with the addition of designs in 7.5YR 5/2-4/2 (Weak Red) or 10R 4/2-4/3 (Weak Red) and/or 5YR 8/4-8/3 or 10YR 8/2 (White). Examples of this fabric may simply have been more elaborately decorated examples of Fabrics IC and ID. Field Fabric II Plain Mineral-tempered Brown Ware. This fabric must be considered as a (firing?) variant of the main Field Fabric I, being similar in the method of manufacture, as well as in the type and size of</page><page sequence="239">1998 Appendix 1 223 the inclusions. It differs, however, in the color of its core, which is sometimes gray, often 10R 5/8 (Red), but most frequently 5YR 4/6 (Yellowish Red). The interior and exterior surfaces are un? slipped and vary in color from 5YR 6/3 (Light Reddish Brown) to 5/3 (Reddish Brown). Field Fabric IIA Mineral-tempered Brown Ware, with Brown Slip. This subtype is identical in fabric to the main Fabric II ware, except that it has been covered with a slip of, or fired to the same color as, the fabric. As in the A variant of the Mineral-tempered Red Ware, this slip can exhibit randomly spaced bands of wheel burnishing. Field Fabric IIB Mineral-tempered Brown Ware, with Orange Slip. As with Field Fabric IB, this subtype exhib- ited a slip that was used either to cover the whole vessel or to highlight specific portions of the form. The slip varied in color between 5YR 7/6 and 6/6 (Reddish Yellow) and was placed directly on the brown fabric of the main Fabric II. Field Fabric IIC Red or Brown Mineral-tempered Ware, Mottled. The existence of this category reinforced the re? lationship between the red and brown mineral tempered wares, as well as supported the suggestion that the color differences between the two wares were the product of vagaries in the firing stage of the vessels' manufacture. The pieces included here had either red or brown as their predominant color but were mottled through a full spectrum of earth colors to a dark gray and very occasionally black. This appeared to be the result of the primary firing, and not, as in the class of cooking pots, the result of secondary burning associated with the use of the vessels. In most cases, parallels for the shapes could be found readily among the vessels of Fabrics I and II. Field Fabric IID Mineral-tempered: Fired Black. The last variant of the Red (Field Fabric I) and Brown (Field Fabric II) mineral-tempered wares was that in which the surfaces had been completely fired to black. Again, it should be noted that this is the result of primary, not secondary, firing. Field Fabric III Cooking Pot Ware. Many of the cooking pots or casseroles from our excavations at Naukratis had been fashioned from a fabric that shares many similarities with the red mineral-tempered ware to which it must be directly related. The clay of the cooking pots is as well-levigated as that of any of the other fabrics, and the grit inclusions remain about 1 mm rather than the larger, more heat conductive, pieces that are often found in vessels with this function. Whereas the examples of Field Fabric IIC were randomly mottled from their position or time in the kiln, the cooking pots exhib- ited gray to black discoloration on the lower portions of the body, below the slightly projecting handles, and other on areas that would be in close proximity to the heat of a secondary fire. Many of the pots had been given the same, thin, horizontally burnished bands noted above in some examples of Field Fabric I and Field Fabric II.</page><page sequence="240">224 Appendix 1 AASOR 55 Field Fabric IIIA Cooking Pot Ware: Variant. This subfabric was represented in the Naukratis catalogue by only two pieces. Both of these fragments were from similar necked jars and differ only in their size. Although they closely resembled the Field Fabric I Ware, the fabric appeared to be much more com? pletely levigated, and the vessels were fired to a hardness paralleled only by the cooking pots dis? cussed above. The exteriors, and portions of the interiors, of the two certain examples were covered with a 7.5R 4/6 (Red) Slip, as are the Fabric I pieces. Where abraded, the Fabric IIIA sherds reveal a surface close to 10R 6/8 (Light Red), the color seen on decorated examples of Fabric IB. Chaff-Tempered Fabrics Field Fabric IV Chaff-tempered Pink Ware. While the first three field types were characterized by mineral tem? per, the Fabric IV fabric, and its variants, rely heavily on straw and chaff temper. The clay of Fabric IV vessels was poorly, or at best moderately, levigated. That it is related to the fabrics of Fabrics I?III can be seen by the presence of red, white, and gray grit averaging c. 1 mm, but the mineral inclusions were in the minority. As shown by the casts, the major tempering agent was straw (c. 3-5 mm in length and c. 1 mm in diameter) and chaff (up to 1 cm in length and 2-3 mm in diameter), both of which were used in large quantities. Although in most cases the vessels had been fired at a temperature sufficient to burn away most of this organic material, the cores of some of the fragments showed the temper itself rather than the casts. The low temperature of the kiln was also evidenced by the color of the core, which ranges from black on the thicker pieces through 7.5R 5/4-4/4 (Weak Red) on some of the thinner sherds. The interior and exterior surfaces of all examples of this type had been heavily coated with a slip that ranged from 2.5YR 6/4 (Light Reddish Brown)- 6/6 (Light Red) to a 10R 6/4 (Pale Red)-6/6 (Light Red), but this slip was as rich in organic inclu? sions as the fabric. Hence the surfaces were heavily pocked by the casts of the temper. This slip was very thick, up to 2-3 mm, and readily adhered to the surface corrugation resulting from the formation of the pot. Only a single example (an unillustrated ring-base fragment) varied from this norm, exhib- iting a thick 10YR 8/2 (White) slip on the interior surface. In all other respects, however, it was the same as the standard Fabric IV Field Fabric IVA Chaff-tempered Brown Ware. As with the mineral-tempered wares, the chaff-tempered fabrics also had color variants that were most probably the result of differing kiln conditions. Examples of Fabric IVA had cores of 5YR 5/3-4/3 (Reddish Brown) with surface between 7.5YR 6/4 (Light Brown) and 5/4 (Brown), but in other respects they were the same as the major Fabric IV A small base (Leonard in Coulson and Leonard 1981a: fig. 5:7) was the exception; both its core and its surface have 5YR 7/8 (Reddish Yellow). Field Fabric IVB Chaff-tempered Mottled Ware. Fabric IVB was a version of the chaff-faced wares with surface colors mottled between those of Fabrics IV and IVA.</page><page sequence="241">1998 Appendix 1 225 Field Fabric IVC Chaff-tempered Red Ware. Three sherds (unillustrated) of a fabric similar to that of Fabric IV, but covered on the exterior with a 7.5R 6/8 (Light Red) slip, stood out sharply from the rest of the assemblage. Unfortunately, these were all body sherds and thus did not contribute to our knowledge of the shapes of this variant. They are included here because of their distinctive nature and for the sake of completeness. Field Fabric IVD Chaff-tempered Black Ware. Although the colors of the chaff-tempered class did vary and mot- tling did occur, only one example had been fired completely black. It was assigned a special subfabric in order to balance the Fabric IIC of the mineral-tempered ware and to hold a position in the cor? pus for future occurrences of the type. Field Fabric IVE Chaff-tempered Painted Ware. Only one example of chaff-tempered ware had been noted that bore a painted decoration. This is, unfortunately, a body sherd, which shows a broad (4 cm) band of 5YR 8/3-7/3 (Pink) paint around the body of the vessel, bordered above and below by a c. .06- .07 cm band of 5YR 6/2 (Pinkish Gray) paint. Coarse Fabrics Field Fabric VA Smooth-slipped Coarse Ware. Coarse wares appeared in the Naukratis assemblage in two very distinct subtypes: Fabric VA (Smooth-slipped Coarse Ware) whose use of chaff tempering formed a bridge between the chaff-faced wares of Fabric IV and the very rudimentary Fabric VB (Coarse Ware) to be discussed below. Morphologically, Fabric VA vessels consisted basically of low, thick- walled bowls or platters. The fabric was poorly levigated, and the large (1.0-1.5 cm) pieces of chaff temper often appeared in clumps in the thick gray and/or 10R 5/4 (Weak Red) sections. The inte? rior and exterior surfaces of these vessels had been covered with a thick slip, which corresponded in color to the various subtypes of the chaff-faced group. Surprisingly, compared with the Fabric IV fabrics, much more care has been taken to remove the large organic temper from the slip. It was replaced by small (sand-sized to .01 cm) white and gray mineral temper. Admittedly, the surfaces, on occasion, are broken by the casts from the small organic tempering agents that remained, but, on the whole, the slip presented a much better appearance than the chaff-tempered wares and recalled the slips of the mineral-tempered vessels. This fact can, perhaps, be used to argue the relative ho- mogeneity of the local fabrics at Naukratis during this period. Field Fabric VB Coarse Ware. Fabric VB consisted of the truly coarse vessels of the assemblage. Forms had thick walls and simple shapes. Large pieces of chaff, to 1.50 cm in length and up to 3 mm in diameter, were frequent in the poorly levigated fabric, and thick gray cores are common. Most fabric colors range from 2.5YR 5/4 (Reddish Brown) to 6/6 (Light Red) and slips, when present, were the same</page><page sequence="242">226 Appendix 1 AASOR 55 color as the fabric but broken by the chaff casts. To judge from the marks on the preserved surfaces, some of the vessels were apparently smoothed with a handful of chaff before they were fired. One vessel, illustrated by Leonard (Coulson and Leonard 1981a: fig. 13.B:2), appeared from its charred interior and fenestrated body to have functioned as a type of brazier. Two other fragments also had traces of holes through their wall, but neither was sufficiently preserved to give any indica- tion of its original shape. The remainder of the Fabric VB coarse-ware sherds come from low bowls and platters. Local Amphora Fabrics Field Fabric VI Amphorae. Fragments from amphorae constituted our Field Fabric VI. Although it is readily admitted that this is equivalent to changing typological horses in midstream, it was thought best to keep fragments of such a distinctive form together in one section. The most common amphora type had a long neck and slightly outsplayed rim. The fabric was moderately well-levigated, containing mineral temper similar to, but larger (up to 2 mm) than, the mineral-tempered fabric, Fabric I, and its variants. The thin (c. 3 mm) cores range from gray to 7.5YR 5/2 (Brown), usually sandwiched by a 10R 6/6 (Light Red)-5/6 (Red) fabric. Traces of a very thin slip appeared on the exterior of most of the examples. Where relatively thick, this slip was approximately 10YR 8/3-8/4 (Very Pale Brown), but where thinner, it approached 5YR 8/3-8/4 (Pink). It is here considered that this is the same slip and that the color of the pinker variant is simply a result of the overlapping of a thin layer of whitish slip over the reddish fabric. The slip was entirely missing from some parts of these vessels, especially near the rim and in the handle zone, where raised ridges of clay had been left after paring or hand-smoothing the junction of these features to the main form. Although morphologically similar to the other amphorae of Fabric VI, the neck fragment illus? trated by Leonard (Coulson and Leonard 1981a: fig. 12:4) differed completely in terms of fabric and temper. It was made of a poorly levigated fabric with a thick black core and surface colors not unlike the redder variants of the amphorae previously discussed (5YR 6/3 [Light Reddish Brown]-5/3 [Red? dish Brown]). It was the temper, however, seen also in some of the amphora toes, that caused it to stand out so sharply from the other vessels of this form, for it is closely related to the chaff-tempered fabrics of Fabric IV and its variants. In fact, this similarity might, at first, suggest that it was a local version of an imported form were it not for the fact that the temper and levigation of the majority of the amphorae gave the impression of being related to the mineral-tempered wares of Fabric I. It is here considered, therefore, that almost all of the amphorae from Naukratis that were included in Fabric VI represented relatively local products, with the mineral-tempered being the norm and the chaff-tempered forming an evidently not-too-successful variant. Field Fabric VIA Amphora with Pink Paint/Slip. The only variant to the local amphorae noted in the assemblage was the upper portion of a small vessel illustrated by Leonard (Coulson and Leonard 1981a: fig. 12:8). The fabric was 7.5YR 5/2 (Brown), as the standard amphorae considered above, and the well-levigated clay showed only sand-sized white grit and micaceous inclusions. The exterior surface, however, had been covered with a 5YR 7/4 (Pink) to 7/6 (Reddish Yellow) slip/paint, which had been carried over</page><page sequence="243">1998 Appendix 1 227 the rim to form a horizontal band c. 3 cm wide on the interior. That this paint was extremely fluid when applied is illustrated by the way that it had dripped down into the interior of the vessel. Delta Silt Slipped and Burnished Ware Field Fabric VII Red Burnished, Drip-painted Ware. Three sherds from the corpus had a 10R 5/6 (Red) paint applied in drips on their exterior surfaces. The fabric, temper, and color of these fragments were all similar to Fabric IIA, with which they are probably to be grouped, but at this embryonic stage in the development of the present corpus they are best kept as a separate entity. That they should be considered among the finer wares is evidenced by the randomly spaced, horizontal band-burnishing that appeared on the interior surface of the fragments (illustrated by Leonard in Coulson and Leonard 1981a: fig. 12.7). Miscellaneous Fabrics Field Fabric VIII Red Slipped Closely-burnished Ware. Although the use of randomly spaced band-burnishing has been previously noted, examples of the burnishing of the entire exterior surface of a vessel to a high luster are quite rare. Three of these fragments were body sherds, while the remaining four offered minimal information about their complete forms. The fabrics of two sherds appeared to be related to the mineral-tempered wares, while one fragment might suggest a relation with the chaff-tempered class. Perhaps to be included in this category was an (unillustrated) body fragment of a well-levigated and well-fired fabric. The color of the fabric was within the range of the Fabric I clays, 10R 6/8 (Light Red)-5/8 (Red), but the burnishing strokes (applied after the vessel had been removed from the wheel) were vertical rather than horizontal and closely spaced. The possibility that it was an import to Naukratis would not be excluded. Field Fabric IX White Smooth-slipped Ware. The vessels included in this category were made of a moderately well-levigated fabric resembling, in color, Field Fabric I (Mineral Tempered Red Ware). It con? tained white and gray grit temper averaging 1-2 mm, and fine straw casts could be present, but were infrequent. One surface was left as the fabric, while the other surface was covered by a smooth coat of 7.5YR 8/2 (Pinkish White) or white (no Munsell equivalent) slip. Below the slip, the color of the core could range from 7.5YR 7/4 (Pink) to 5YR 7/4 (Pink). Where the slip was applied more thinly, the surface often took on the pinkish hue, but even where thinly applied the slip was unbroken by the mineral inclusions of the fabric with the result that the surface was always smooth. The range of shapes in this fabric is limited at Naukratis, and it may have been an import. Perhaps the minute fragment of a double amphora handle in this fabric would point to an East Greek origin.</page><page sequence="244">228 Appendix 1 AASOR 55 Field Fabric IXA White Gritty-slipped Ware. This ware was characterized by a slip approximating 10YR 8/2 (White) that was slightly gritty to the touch. The clay was well-levigated and tempered with sand- sized to 1 mm white grit and fine straw. The firing of the individual vessels varied as did the color of the cores, which could range from the color of the slip through 5YR 7/3 (Pink). The range of vessel types was larger than that of Fabric IX from which the presence of the gritty slip definitely sets it apart. The shape of the baggy base (Leonard in Leonard and Coulson 1981a: fig. 13A:7) and internally grooved rim (Leonard in Coulson and Leonard 1981a: fig. 13A:6) might suggest that we are dealing here with products of a local workshop. Field Fabric IXB White-slipped Coarse Ware. The two, rather abraded, sherds (Leonard in Coulson and Leonard 1982: fig. 13A:12, and one unillustrated fragment) of this category were definitely from amphorae; but, because the shapes are completely different from the more standard amphora of Fabric VI, and since they may be related by fabric to Fabric IX, they were classified as a separate entity. The fabric was well-levigated with c. 1 mm white grit, which was surprisingly fine for vessels of this size. The core was approximately 5YR 5/3 (Reddish Brown) below a fabric of 5YR 7/4 (Pink). The interior surface of the amphora toe had been given a coating of a 5YR 7/3-7/4 (Pink) slip, while the exte? riors of both sherds had been covered with a slip between 5YR 8/2 (Pinkish White) and 7.5YR 8/2 (Pinkish White). This category is considered to be an import at Naukratis, and its similarities to Fabric IX may suggest an East Greek origin. Field Fabric X Pink-slipped Ware. Although there was some variety within Fabric X, the common denomina- tor was the presence of a thick slip ranging in color from 5YR 8/3-8/4 (Pink). In some cases the color of the slip appears to be the result of how thickly it had been applied, since it can vary through 5YR 8/3 (Pink) to 10YR 8/2 (Pinkish White) on the same fragment. The fabric was well- levigated and tempered with c. 1 mm white, gray, and occasionally red temper. The core was gray on the thicker fragments, sandwiched between the 2.5YR 61A (Light Reddish Brown) of the fabric, but in the thinner sherds the color of the fabric predominates throughout the entire section. Al? though Fabric X contained more variety than other types noted here, it was definitely distinct from them and, in that sense at least, warranted consideration as a separate class. Terra Nigra Fabrics A significant quantity of "Black Glazed" or Terra Nigra sherds were encountered during the ex? cavations at Naukratis. In the field I separated such pieces into seven groups, which appeared to me to represent five different and distinct fabrics. The surface appearance of a given piece was recorded on a simple, tripartite scale: dull, shiny, or lustrous. Terra Nigra 1 Terra Nigra 1, as defined in the field, is the equivalent to our standard Fabric IID (Mineral- tempered Ware: Black) whose fabric and surface color appear to have occurred during the firing process.</page><page sequence="245">1998 Appendix 1 229 Terra Nigra 2 Examples of Terra Nigra 2 differ from the above fabric in that a lustrous black slip has been ap? plied over extremely well-levigated and (usually temperless) fabrics of distinctive color that range from c. 2.5YR 6/6 (Light Red) to 5YR 6/6 (Reddish Yellow). Such pieces appear to have been genuine imports from the Greek World. Terra Nigra 3 The fabric of Terra Nigra 3 is fired throughout to a light to medium gray, often approaching 5YR 6/1 (Gray). There is no distinct core. Terra Nigra 4 Consists of a group of three, visually-related, gray-brown fabrics that may be variants of each other. In the field these were separated into three subgroups (4A through 4C). Terra Nigra 4A A fabric c. 10YR 3/2 (Very Dark Grayish Brown) that can range to 10YR 4/3-3/3 (Dark Brown). It does not exhibit any distinct core. The surfaces are usually shiny to lustrous. Terra Nigra 4B A fabric c. 10YR 3/2 (Very Dark Grayish Brown) that can range to 10YR 4/3-3/3 (Dark Brown). It differs from the above fabric in that it exhibits a very distinct gray or black core. In addition there seem to be minute pieces of lithic temper in the slip. Surface appearance is shiny to lustrous. Terra Nigra 4C. Gray-brown fabric with red or red and gray core. A c. 10YR 3/2 (Very Dark Grayish Brown) to 10YR 4/3-3/3 (Dark Brown) fabric, with a distinct c. 5YR 4-8 (Red) or 7.5YR 3/6-3/8 (Dark Red) core. An evidently related variant of this fabric (recognized and recorded but not isolated in the field) displayed a c. 7.5YR N5/ (Gray) central core within a red (as above) sandwich. Surfaces were usually at least shiny to lustrous. Terra Nigra 5 A fabric that has been fired c. 7.5YR N6/-N5/ (Gray) almost completely through the section, except just below the slip where there is a very thin sandwich in the gray-brown range of the Terra Nigra 4 series (c. 10YR 3/2 [Very Dark Grayish Brown] to 10YR 3/3 [Dark Brown]) and may, in fact, actually be related to that group. There are traces of fine organic temper in the slip. Surfaces are usu? ally dull, although sometimes dull to shiny. Notes Epigraph was also quoted by Price (1924: 181), and answered in a somewhat different manner. This appendix was originally published as part of the Kom Hadid report (Leonard 1997), It is repeated here for the sake of accessibility to this volume. The description of this fabric differs slighdy from that pre? sented after it had been isolated during our initial season of ex? cavation (Leonard in Coulson and Leonard 1981a). This fuller description is the result of the examination of the tremendous quantity of sherd material during subsequent seasons.</page><page sequence="246">Appendix 2: Environmental and Medical Problems Encountered during the 1980 Season Morris Weiss, M.D. The fellow who coined the phrase, "He who tastes water of the Nile shall return" might well have added, "and be certain to have a bottle of Lomotil tablets." This appendix is a summary of the envi? ronmental difficulties experienced in the summer of 1980 while excavating and living at the village of Kom Ge'if, the site of the ancient Greek city of Naukratis. As a cardiologist whose avocation is archaeology, I joined the expedition as a volunteer. In antic- ipation of a harsh environment, the directors requested that I include a number of basic medicines in my baggage. No one, however, could have envisioned the series of traumatic events we would have to overcome to maintain the health of the group. Almost every hardship one could imagine in such a setting occurred; but, with the cooperative efforts of the entire staff, that first season at Naukratis was nonetheless extremely fruitful. Nothing we experienced was unique, but it would be worth reviewing those obstacles that can prevent an excavation from being productive. Kom Ge'if is an Egyptian farming village, consisting primarily of mudbrick buildings with sur- rounding fields. The way of life is quite simple and, except for an occasional tractor, the sights resem- ble scenes painted on the walls of ancient tombs and temples. In this pastoral environment, the basic necessities of food, water, and sanitation became major logistical problems for the group. A four-room farmhouse with dirt courtyard facing a shallow irrigation canal served as excavation headquarters. One room was converted into a kitchen, another used for a dining room, a third for storing materials, and the last as a haven from the intense afternoon heat. The volunteers pitched their one- and two-person tents in the courtyard for sleeping while several larger screen houses were used for processing artifacts. We were naive in the ways of Egyptian village life; we did not fully anticipate the hazards of living in a farm enclosure where humans and animals cohabit. The natives bring cows and water buffaloes into the farmhouses at night, and the excrement is dried and used as fuel for cook? ing and heating. This provides perfect breeding conditions for flies, of which there is always a dense population, both inside and outside the buildings. In addition, our farmhouse and courtyard were heavily infested with fleas from the dogs, chickens, and other animals that inhabited the area. Our advance party arrived several days earlier than the rest of the group and was soon covered with flea bites after sweeping straw, dung, and debris from the farmhouse. The dust and straw in the courtyard where the tents were pitched were also heavily infested. Soon, every tent, along with our clothing and bedding, was flea-ridden. Our initial efforts to eliminate the fleas were unsuccessful. After two weeks we managed to obtain some spray guns and a malodorous local flea spray. After watching the villagers sweep down their courtyards, we adopted the idea, cleansed our own facility of straw and sprinkled the area with flea spray. This successfully kept down the pest problem. Water also proved to be a major problem. The immediate water supply was a hand-pumped well only 5.0 m from the toilet. Since the water table in the Delta is in places only 3.5 m below the surface, 230</page><page sequence="247">1998 Appendix 2 231 the well was undoubtedly contaminated. We secured an adequate supply of water for cooking and drinking by bringing "clean" water in five-gallon containers from a pump in a neighboring village that was on the water line from the provincial capital. A constant supply of "clean" water is an absolute necessity, for a person must drink, in addition to his usual daily intake of two to three liters, 14-16 extra 8-ounze (250 cc) glasses of water each day in order to survive the heat of the Delta. He also must take four to eight salt tablets per day to keep up strength. To encourage drinking, a vat of water, to which we added an Egyptian brand of concen? trated orange-flavored extract, was always available in the kitchen. Periodically, volunteers cleaned the containers with boiling water, since they would rapidly become contaminated. Although unsafe for drinking, our well water could be used in several different ways. A 20-gallon (80-liter) galvanized tank was secured on top of the farmhouse, fittings were attached and brought through the roof, and a closet off one of the rooms thus became a shower. To prevent fungus infection of the feet, a pan of water with added Clorox was placed outside the shower, and everyone was required to walk through this before drying his/her feet. Another galvanized tank, fitted with spigot, was placed in the courtyard. We made an attempt at purification by adding Halozone tablets, and we could then use the water from the second tank for washing hands and face before meals. General sanitation was another logistical stumbling block. Mess kits served as dishes. These were kept on a table and covered with window screening to keep away the flies. Dish washing involved scrubbing loose food particle off the utensils with boiled "clean" water and detergent, then dipping them in boiling water and allowing it to air dry on the screen-covered table. The only indoor toilet was one of Turkish style in a closet off one of the rooms. In the closet were kept a ladle and a large ceramic jug filled with well water which was used for flushing in conjunction with a scoop of powdered lime. Soap and a tub of "clean" water for washing hands were also available nearby. A single Turkish toilet was obviously inadequate for the entire staff of 24 people. Accordingly, we dug a trench latrine near the campsite. Toilet seats were purchased in Cairo and a commode was constructed over a trench measuring 1.0 m. in width and 2.0 m. in depth, with broken pottery at the bottom to facilitate the percolation of waste. This trench latrine was only a short distance from the tents, but to reach it required a dash across the courtyard, followed by a leap across the irrigation canal. When the "Kom Ge'if gallop" or the "Damanhur dance" struck, even the speediest and most agile of us risked disaster if we tried to run too hastily, especially in crossing the canal. The kitchen area was made off-limits to everyone except the volunteer cook and his/her helpers for that day. We covered the windows with screening and eliminated flies with a local bug spray. Two- burner stoves fueled by bottled gas served for cooking. No refrigeration, however, was available during the first season owing to the nine-month wait required for the purchase of refrigerators in Egypt, so basic staples had to be bought daily from local vendors. Egyptians fertilize their fields with "night soil" (human excrement). Consequently all vegetables and most fruits must be thoroughly cooked, and no salad items can be eaten raw. The American gastrointes- tinal tract is not prepared to cope with the parasites and bacteria with which the Egyptian has learned to live. The delicacies of our rural area included unpasteurized water buffalo butter, goat's milk and goat yogurt, all of which we had to avoid. A local sausage, thoroughly recooked, was our main meat source. Only the orange, with its thick outer skin, was safe to eat fresh. The menus were devised to provide adequate fluid volume, salt, and calories for people performing hard manual labor in a hot humid environment. Our day began at 4:00 a.m. with a quick breakfast of hot tea, local bread, and jelly. At 9:00 a.m. we ate a second breakfast, much the same as the first, but with some hard cheese added. The noon meal included soup for volume and pasta for calories. Supper</page><page sequence="248">232 Appendix 2 AASOR 55 was a lighter meal of soup, pasta, or eggs. Large quantities of salt were added to all prepared foods, and, to increase caloric intake, cheese, jelly, bread, and, if available, peanut butter, were provided with each meal. Volunteers from the group did all the cooking as well as the washing of the dishes. All pots were scrubbed in boiled "clean" water and air dried in the same manner as the mess kits. The medical problems we faced also seem worthy of review. Fortunately, all the illnesses which occurred could be treated at camp. The most serious skin problems, with which everyone was afflicted to some degree, were from flea bites. Two types of reaction occurred, the milder being a small punc? ture lesion requiring only a local application of Calamine lotion to control the itching. The more serious reaction produced a swelling and redness around bite areas, and the resultant itching was severe. This discomfort caused loss of sleep, and soon fatigue and irritability occurred. A topical ste- roid ointment controlled some of the redness and swelling, but oral Benadryl, an antihistamine, was necessary for the incessant itching. Nothing, however, was totally effective in controlling the allergic- like reaction. Oral steroid therapy did not seem justified because of potential harmful side effects. This problem can only be solved with the total elimination of the fleas. The only other minor skin problems encountered were one case of infected hair follicles from a dirty beard and a mild case of acne on the chest wall that was due to heat and dirt. Both of these were soon eliminated with cleansing and a mild topical antibiotic ointment. Wind, sand, and dust caused frequent irritation of the eyes. There was one case of a foreign body in the eye, consisting of a dust particle that was easily removed from the upper lid; another person required topical eye antibiotic for the treatment of mild conjunctivitis. Contact lenses should not be worn in such an environment. One of the volunteers came to the excavation with a flu syndrome and several others developed similar symptoms during the next five to seven days. These consisted of 24 hours of fever as high as 102.6?F (39.2 ?C) with muscle aching. The illness rapidly resolved itself with adequate fluids and aspirin for the control of the pain and fever. Two of the flu cases developed transient mild bronchitis with coughing for 24-36 hours, which cleared spontaneously without the use of antibiotics. Fortunately, no serious cases of injury occurred and all minor abrasions were quickly treated with cleansing, first-aid cream, and a simple Band-Aid. Disorders of the gastrointestinal tract were with us from the time the group arrived in Cairo until we left Egypt. Most volunteers had some mild form of disorder, even from drinking the water in Cairo. Symptoms usually involved one to three days of lower abdominal cramping with diarrhea or loose stools which, to my knowledge, were never bloody, and associated at times with slight nausea but with no vomiting. Many developed a more severe form of this disorder while at camp. Those most seriously affected were the individuals who failed to keep all the sanitary rules and at times broke the dietary warnings concerning raw fruit, vegetables and salads, especially during the weekend rest peri? ods in Alexandria. Those whose diarrhea did not abate in 24?48 hours were watched carefully and their fluid intake increased. A bland diet was recommended, but no antibiotics were prescribed for this short-term illness. If the diarrhea persisted for five days, the individual started antibiotics and usually saw improvement within 48 hours. There were only two who were treated in this manner, and they were prescribed Vibramycin. Every attempt was made to prevent dehydration. We spiked the water with the orange concentrate already mentioned in order to make it more enticing to those reluctant individuals who did not appreciate the dehydrating effects of the Delta environment. Extra canteen water was carried to the site each today, and frequent breaks for water with added salt tablets were encouraged.</page><page sequence="249">1998 Appendix 2 233 For several days one group of volunteers conducted a surface sherding survey of a large, unshaded area, and several of them became quite dehydrated. They all developed the earliest signs of dehydra- tion, including irritability, marked fatigue, and a feeling of weakness. It was calculated that as many as 25 additional 8-ounze (250cc) glasses of fluid per day would have been necessary to keep these people well-hydrated in this type of environment. An occasional excavator, against advice, would try to work when afflicted with abdominal cramps, nausea, and diarrhea and subsequently became severely dehydrated, developing marked nausea and vomiting with an intense headache. In two such cases, Compazine suppositories were prescribed to control the nausea and vomiting. These patients were also given small sips of water every few minutes along with frequent salt tablets, and usually within eight to twelve hours, they began to respond. The volume of urine passed during a twenty-four hour period is a good indication of one's state of hydration. If one passes less than 750cc per day, a negative fluid balance is occurring. Each person was advised to watch carefully his/her urine volume and to drink more water if not producing at least 250cc three times a day. Our problems were further compounded by the nature of the campsite. The courtyard where the tents were pitched was unprotected from the sun, so that the tents were much too hot to enter until the evening hours. Only two small rooms were available where individuals could read or write letters. Sleep was virtually impossible during off hours from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. because of the crowded con? ditions, intense heat, and incessant flies. As a result, those fatigued by dehydration were made worse by poor afternoon rest conditions, often compounded by a lack of sleep at night due to fleas. Most of us arrived at Naukratis thinking the Egyptian scorpion and asp would be our greatest en- emies. Everyone carried camping cots with legs at least six inches high. We discovered, however, that the villages had effectively eliminated scorpions and snakes from their immediate environment. These, of course, are a much greater hazard when excavating in areas which are not inhabited. Instead, fleas, flies, and fluid balance became our foes. Subsequent seasons at Naukratis have not been as difficult, since more living space has been available and a greater variety of foods could be purchased in Alex? andria. But, scrupulous attention to sanitation, pest control, and fluid balance remain essential to any successful excavation in this part of the world. Notes This section is offered here as an appendix to the main work not only because of its intrinsically didactic value, but also because it supplies the human backdrop against which the labors of our very dedicated staff and volunteers must be viewed.</page><page sequence="250">Bibliography Adams, W Y. 1986 Ceramic Industries ofMedieval Nubia: Vol. 1.
