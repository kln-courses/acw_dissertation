<plain_text><page sequence="1">BERNARD M. ZLOTOWiTZ, The Septuagint Translation of the Hebrew Terms in Relation to God in the Book of Jeremiah (New York: Ktav, 1981). Pp. xxv + 196. $20. This is an accurate study of the nouns and verbs in the LXX translation of the Book of Jeremiah referring to "anthropomorphisms, anthropopathisms, and other terms of physical human attributes of God" (p. xi). Chapter 1 (pp. 3-64) presents us with ten anthropomorphisms (e.g., "arm," "hand," "right hand"), sixteen anthropopathisms (e.g., "to love," "anger," "to avenge," "to rejoice"), two psychological terms ("heart," "spirit"), and four other human characteristics. Chapter 2 (pp. 65-167) considers forty-eight "physical and other acts associated with God." These acts are divided into "favorable" - "unfavorable" and "general," "'favorable* if it is pro-Israel and/ or anti-nations, and 'unfavorable* if it is anti-Israel and / or pro-nations. It is 'general' when contextually both Israel and the nations are treated together as one" (pp. xii-xiii).</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 673 Chapter 3 (pp. 169-73) treats of "God's holy abodes," i.e., "God's destruction of Shiloh, Jerusalem, Zion, and the Temple." Chapter 4 (pp. 175-81) "God in terms of family relationships": "marriage, hus- band, father, and divorce." Chapter 5 consists of half a page (p. 183) of "conclusions": "The Septuagint translator(s)? of the book of Jeremiah reproduced literally and correctly the Hebrew terms related to God. . . . Even when - and that only quite rarely- the translator rendered a word less than literally ... the sole motive was to make the Hebrew phrase intelligible, but not to avoid any anthropomorphism." Mastery of Hebrew and Greek is evident throughout, but the limits Zlotowitz has imposed on his study may diminish the usefulness of the book. Usually the whole verse containing the term to be studied (a single noun or a verb) is quoted in both Hebrew and Greek. Since the study was limited to these terms, differences between the Greek and the Hebrew (numerous indeed in Jeremiah) are left unexplained, or simply alluded to, with the terse comment "this is not our concern here." Note that the many "pluses" of the Hebrew text are simpy referred to as "lack- ing" or "wanting" in the LXX. On pp. 141-42, the ten lines of the Hebrew text of Jer 27:5-8 are printed with the four lines of the LXX text (34:4-6) without even a word of explanation as to the differences between these traditions. Finally, the method followed, which entails complete listings of terms, calls for numerous repetitions of the quoted verses, e.g., Jer 1:10 (two lines of Hebrew and three lines of Greek) is printed not less than seven times. Concerning the study of šlh (pp. 154-66), the ten lines of the introductory paragraph (p. 154) would, in my opinion, have been clear enough. The Hebrew and the Greek text of the verses printed in this study would greatly help in assessing the divergences between the traditions underlying the story of the way Jeremiah was transmitted to us, but such was beyond the limits Z. had set himself. The book is very well printed and bound; few misprints are to be noted: p. 47 read māDas (for magarvi), p. 63 Gr. sy (for siri), p. 99 plassõn (for klassõn ), p. 119, final s in laos. Because of the self-imposed limits of this study, the cost of the book is very high indeed. Léo Laberge. O.M.I., St. Paul University, Ottawa, Ont., Kl S 1C4 Canada</page></plain_text>
