<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Return to Moral and Religious Philosophy in Early America, by Rem B. Edwards. Washington, D.C.: University Press of America, Inc., 1982. 175 pages. Pbk., $10.50. 256 Offering a well written and interesting volume Rem Edwards brings into focus the philosophical perspectives of Jonathan Edwards, Thomas Jefferson, and Ralph Waldo Emerson as representatives of major viewpoints in early American culture, although there are more than passing references to William Ellery Channing, Benja- min Franklin, Theodore Parker, Thomas Paine, and Henry David Thoreau. Ed- wards represents a Calvinistic oriented Puritan thinker, Jefferson, the epitomy of the Enlightenment view with its emphasis on reason, and Emerson, the romantic and individualistic proponent of Transcendentalism. The book concentrates on the major moral and religious problems which these thinkers considered: the problem of the nature of God and his relation to the world, the problem of the form and content of morality, the problem of how man becomes enlightened about what he claims to know, and the problem of human freedom, particularly as set against the backdrop of a strict Calvinism. These are indeed important problems in philosophy of religion and the book has much to contribute to their historical understanding. The author is careful to distinguish Jefferson's "deism" from the commonplace characterizations of that view as "im- personal," portraying God as devoid of anthropomorphic traits or as indifferent to the welfare of humankind. Nor does the author fail to indicate an ambiguity in Jefferson's attitude and beliefs concerning life after death and a misplaced con- fidence in the argument from common consensus to monotheism. Students of history, religious studies, and philosophy cannot fail to benefit from the author's presentation of Jefferson's views of equality and rights as well as that thinker's religious perspective. A concluding chapter is more controversial since it attempts to sketch an "ideal- ized American way." Even in such a brief, almost schematic treatment, there are insights that function as a valuable antidote to the rabid "new right" religious fanaticism. Perhaps the author can develop in a substantial and conclusive way in a future book his conception of the principles that nurture continual moral and reli- gious growth. This reviewer would welcome that volume also! John Howie Southern Illinois University</page></plain_text>
