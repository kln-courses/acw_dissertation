<plain_text><page sequence="1">A COUNTER-REVOLUTION IN CONFLICTS LAW? FROM BEALE TO CAVERS Albert A. Ehrenzweig * Greeting David Cavers's Cooley Lectures on the choice-of-law process, Professor Ehrenzweig takes stock of the current upheaval in torts conflict of laws thinking. Though he dissents from parts of Professor Cavers's analysis, he emphatically agrees that scholars should now attempt the formulation of "principles of preference" to guide the courts in place of the first Restatement's discredited orthodoxies and the second Restatement's untried heterodoxies. He closes by considering several approaches to evolving such principles. YESTERDAY'S scientific and logical realism gave the lie to Victorian symmetry and sweetness. Today's existentialist abstraction has despaired of soothing the human condition by logical construct or discovered reality. Are we now craving an- other age of certainty, however precarious, of beauty, however frail? Conflicts law, that diminutive concern of human endeavor, has shared in and has, however imperceptively, contributed its share to the eternal struggle. The late-Victorian idol of the Restate- ment has yielded to the "realist" onslaught of "local-law" skep- ticism, and local-law skepticism has yielded to nihilist abstrac- tions of "interests" and "relationships." Has the pendulum swung too far? Is revolution being met by counter-revolution? If we are to answer these questions, we must decide first whether there ever was a revolution and, if there was a revolution, what the regime was that it attacked and conquered. Much of what we read today in case law and legal literature seems to indicate a wholesale upheaval. Justice Roberts of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in an opinion discarding the regime of the lex loci delicti, stressed the duty of his court to "re-examine its position in this field of law and [to] make cer- tain that our rules are in harmony with the realities of this age." He sees our law "at the beginning of the development of a work- able, fair and flexible approach to choice of law . 2. 1 And * Walter Perry Johnson Professor of Law, University of California School of Law (Berkeley); Honorarprofessor of Private International Law, Vienna.

Once the reader has acquiesced in his frustration and is yet willing to read on, he will, I hope, prefer obscure brevity to tedious length. I. THE REVOLUTION A. Scope Current conflicts doctrine is usually viewed as a revolution against the "Establishment" of the first Restatement of Con- flict of Laws. A superficial perusal of the American Law Insti- tute's collection of the Restatement's judicial citations 6 seems to support the view that such an Establishment exists. But I believe to have shown by an analysis of the case law that courts, though regularly citing the Restatement, have in fact accepted but few of its propositions. And virtually all leading scholars to name only Cavers, Cook, Leflar, Lorenzen, Rheinstein, Stum- berg, and Yntema -have rejected both the Restatement's ap- proach and its conclusions from its very inception.8 Indeed, the American Law Institute itself has discarded many of the Re- statement's fundamental concepts,9 although some have been preserved in the Restatement (Second) with which we are now "threatened." '" It would thus not have taken a revolution to 6 AMERICAN LAW INSTITUTE, RESTATEMENT IN THE COCURTS (I945, I948, I954). 'For a list of my pertinent writings see i8 ORLA. L. REV. 353-356 (I965).

What then is the alleged revolution's possible object and scope? This we must determine before we can evaluate the thrust of those called the revolutionaries in today's conflicts law. Many of us are often said to have created chaos by seeking generally to substitute vague policy or interest-directed formulas for well-settled, certain rules. We demur. David Cavers sadly notes that he has incorrectly been labeled the author of the "Cavers method" of atomizing precedent in favor of result-selec- tion and application of "justice in the individual case" (pp. IO, 75-87). Similarly others, like Currie and the author of this study, have repeatedly objected to being "cast as advocates of applying forum law simply because it is forum law." 11 Such misunderstand- ings are dangerous. The nihilistic messages thus imputed could easily cause courts to lose all confidence in established patterns and to resort to decisions ad hoc or, again, to come to distrust the ivory tower and to return to all of the tempting but de- ceptive "certainties" of the past (p. I2i). Those of us whose writings have been said to induce such reactions have the con- tinuing obligation to clarify their positions. Far from seeking to deprive the courts of certainty, we have aimed at aiding them by sifting and, where needed, adding to their store of tools. Cavers, as early as I933, exhorted courts to develop "a body of rules, principles and standards of a new sort . . . through the workings of stare decisis and the combined efforts of courts and scholars . . . .22 12 Today he emphatically repeats this message and again expresses his hope for "the emergence of choice-of-law principles by . . . familiar common-law processes." '1 Similarly, Von Mehren and Trautman anticipate and strive for "a fully developed system of functional choice-of-law rules." 14 And I may claim that, far from having "resignedly accept[ed] some choice-of-law rules" as Cavers suggests (p. 94), I have stressed over and again that conflicts theory should carefully distinguish between its bifurcated tasks: reformulation of existing law in terms of true rules replacing false doctrine,'5 and proposals de lip. 86; see p.

Much of the present turmoil has been caused, I believe, by the erroneous assumption that conflicts theory can usefully serve both aims by the same techniques. Currie's "in- terests" and Cavers's "preferences" as well as Leflar's "choice- influencing considerations" are primarily designed to state desir- able rules rather than to rationalize settled law. It is only in areas outside settled law that such inquiries can have meaning, and it is only in such areas that a revolution can be said to have occurred. It is not a coincidence, therefore, that Cavers does not include among the examples for new "preferences" either the law of property - except for property transfers which he equates with contracts (pp. I8I-203)- whose problems "appear to be with- ering away," or family law, so much of which is part of the law of jurisdiction and judgments.'6 Nor is it a coincidence that all of the preferences listed concern either torts or contracts and con- veyances. A brief analysis of the situation prevailing in contract law will show that the alleged revolution in conflicts theory, in- cluding the impact of Cavers's approach, is further limited in being primarily directed to torts. The law of contracts is tritely and quite regularly referred to as the most confused subject of conflicts law. I have tried to show elsewhere that this appearance is deceptive and that courts in effect have had very little difficulty in dealing with conflicts problems in contract cases.'7 Beale's leges contractus and solu- tionis have hardly been in the way; and those great cases which are generally thought to have inaugurated a new era in this field could easily have been decided within the existing framework, without resort to such "revolutionary" nonrules as the "most [hereinafter cited as TREATISE]; Ehrenzweig, A Proper Law in a Proper Forum: A "Restatement" of the "Lex Fori Approach," i8 OKLA.

The fact that this use (which I have borrowed from Llewellyn) has been regularly misunderstood by authors of such standing will cause me henceforth to seek to avoid it. I have never called those rules of choice "true" which I consider desirable, but those which have been in fact followed by the courts whether or not they did so in terms. Cavers himself has used a similar "realist" technique. See, e.g., Cavers, Trusts Inter Vivos and the Conflict of Laws, 44 HARV. L. REV. i6i (0930). 16Pp. II7, 200 n.38. Cavers might have been less charitable regarding the irresponsible propositions of the RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONFLICT OF LAWS ? I32 (Tent.

Rubin's agreement not to modify a will 18 as well as Mrs. Auten's 19 and Miss Haag's undertaking not to sue 20 could (or should) have been denied effect as contrary to strong forum policies without regard to the relative "significance" of "contacts"; and the validity of Bernkrant's commercial agree- ment2l was explainable by the general "presumption of valid- ity" 22 without resort to "governmental interests." Restated in traditional terms, Cavers's "preferences" in the contract area (pp. i8I-98) reiterate ancient and modern princi- ples of the parties' autonomy. They cover, with yet indetermi- nate exceptions, contracts of adhesion,23 exclude agreements which violate public policy or concern land, and limit autonomous choice, unnecessarily I believe,24 to "reasonably related" laws (pp. I94, 238). But there is also much valuable implementation and arguable application. We shall welcome Cavers's whole- hearted disapproval of contact counting (p. I93) as well as his willingness to let party autonomy prevail even over otherwise mandatory domestic rules (p. I96) and to permit separation of issues (pp. I94-95, I99 n.36). On the other hand, we may have misgivings about Cavers's slight regard for the parties' validating intention.25 And one may wonder at Cavers's apparent accept- Rubin v.

Earlier, I found support, e.g., in Cavers, Trusts Inter Vivos and the Conflict of Laws, 44</page><page sequence="7">i966] CONFLICTS 383 ance, at least as the correct expression of a tendency, of the Restatement's unsupported and unsupportable usury rule 26 as well as of the land taboo; 27 or at his failure (p. i86 n.io) to concede the independent role of the lex fori in such cases as the Hulett case.28 Can it really be a coincidence, to be discounted as such in the list of Cavers's "preferences," that all cases dis- cussed by him in effect either apply the validating law or, in the presence of a prevailing forum policy, the law of the forum? 29 If this fact is not a coincidence and if, as suggested earlier, the case law is explainable in traditional terms of party autonomy, or more generally in Rheinstein's terms of party expectations,30 contract conflicts law would in effect remain untouched and unas- sisted by Cavers's "preferences," and for that matter by the cur- rent "revolution" in general conflicts theory. We may, therefore, and indeed must limit ourselves, in analyzing that revolution, to those issues which pervade the conflicts law of torts. This result is easily explainable and readily acceptable. In historical sequence 31 the conflicts law of torts is a latecomer and has, in its short history, shared the convulsions and transforma- tions of a fast-changing law of enterprise liability for torts.32 Moreover, tort conflicts law, unlike almost all other areas of our subject, has remained unaided by that stabilizing factor, the ex- pectations of the parties at the time of the transaction. No wonder, then, that all the leading cases which, outside the con- tract area, have in the last few years produced the appearance of a ubiquitous revolution,33 have been tort cases.

But here I would join issue from the standpoint of both existing and desirable law: unless forum policy entails the preference, a validating rule of the forum should and does prevail. 30Rheinstein, supra note 7, at 24I. 31 PP.

I3). Indeed, Cavers's new book, like his earlier criticism of my "theory," 3 though purport- edly dealing with the "Choice-of-Law Process" as such, is almost entirely based on the law of torts.35 It is against this background of tort law alone that the following analysis of current issues in general and Cavers's conclusions in particular will have to be read and evaluated. B. Common Ground Rules versus "law." Cavers finds himself in agreement with Currie in seeing "the choice-of-law problem as posed by the need to choose between two specific rules of law, not between the legal systems of two jurisdictions." 36 I have always taken the same position 37 which incidentally must, I believe, be credited to Cook's pioneer work.38 Perhaps much of the existing confusion could be avoided were we to speak of a "Choice-of-Rules" rather than a Choice-of-Law which unavoidably points to those "juris- diction-selecting" techniques so persuasively named and rejected by Cavers.39 Real versus false conflicts. Moreover, there is, or there should be, general agreement that, both de lege lata and de lege ferenda, we must eliminate from our analysis "false conflicts," 40 although there is some difference in defining them. I would, with Cavers, include those cases in which the two "competing" rules are iden- tical notwithstanding the courts' conflicts language.4" But I v.

We are all agreed that, in the absence of a super-law, such as a constitution or treaty, choice-of-law or choice-of-rules is based on the forum's law, and that, in ascertain- ing that law, the first step must be the construction and interpre- tation 43 both of the choice-of-law rules of the forum and of its domestic rules whose displacement is sought (pp. 96-97). That this process includes both legislative and judge-made rules is obvious and no doubt accepted by Cavers notwithstanding oc- casional semantic ambiguity (e.g., pp. I37, 204). But I continue to have considerable misgivings about Cavers's (and Currie's) unsupported faith in the existence of effective constitutional con- trol 44 and Cavers's serious concern with largely and I believe unavoidably abortive treaties and conventions.45 Policies and purposes. More importantly, we agree that the process of construction and interpretation is primarily based on a "teleological" (pp. 90-92) examination of "policies" or, in Cavers's preferable terminology, "purposes." 46 And I share Cavers's caveat that, beyond these policies, other factors, too, require consideration (pp. 97-98, I08-I3). I also wholeheart- edly agree with both Cavers's and Currie's rejection of the sec- to standards of equity or justice. I have given as examples such rules as those referring to "clean hands" or to hardship caused by the corporate veil. On the same ground I have maintained that fraud conflicts cases do not ordinarily call for any law other than that of the forum. A.

But the very lack of such a super-law compels me, on the other hand, to object to both Cavers's and Currie's insistence on the general need for competing analysis of the policies and purposes of all "concerned" states. As I shall reiter- ate in my discussion of "governmental interests," I continue to find it more fruitful analytically to limit our concern to the forum's policy, which may or may not require respect for foreign policies. International and interstate conflicts. Cavers and other writ- ers concede that there are and should be important differences in the treatment by American courts of international and interstate conflicts, differences which may be caused inter alia by the vary- ing impact of the Constitution (pp. II7-I8), by the relative homo- geneity of the laws of the several United States (p. i i 8), by a varying concern with the forum's public policy (p. ii8), and by the varying impact of harmonization (p. ii9). But I would go farther. As I have tried to justify elsewhere, I consider these and other differences important enough to require a complete segre- gation of the casuistic and doctrinal analysis in the two fields.48 Admonitory and compensatory torts. Cavers has found a "thought-provoking, potentially fruitful generalization" in my sug- gestion that, in devising new conflicts rules for torts, we should distinguish between primarily admonitory and primarily com- pensatory torts.49 In dealing separately with "admonitory" dram- shop acts and strict liability statutes primarily designed "to as- sure the collection of damages" (pp. i 6o-62), Cavers has in effect, though not expressly, adopted my suggestion.

"Why ought the forum not adhere to its own self-restricting interpretation and apply the law of the other state, even though that law doesn't want to be applied?" 50 Why not indeed? Cavers states his agreement with my views (p. io6) as well as with the first Restatement's "pure orthodoxy" (p. I07). Dean Griswold's early attempt to save the construct of renvoi 51 as well as the judicial frolic and detour in the Schneider case 52 may now finally be hoped to have been put to rest. An elabora- tion of Cavers's skepticism concerning certain "feat[s] of char- acterization" 53 might have produced a similar result similarly beneficial in a related area. Rules and preferences versus ad hoc decision. Most important, I believe, is Cavers's repeated stress on the existence of binding rules-of-choice and the desirability of creating as many new ones as possible, so as to limit ever further the need for and the scope of all conflicts "theories," including his own (e.g., pp. II3, I2I-22, I37). For this reason I find myself in hearty agreement with Cavers's discounting in effect, though not in terms, solutions de- rived from theories of "governmental interests" (pp. 75, IO,2 I02), and his valiant attempt at implementing, or rather re- placing, abstract "theory" by a formulation of concrete "pref- erences" in such unsettled areas as the conflicts law of torts. Where our common ground ends, new doubts begin. I shall compare Cavers's approach with those two other preeminent doctrines, the second Restatement's experiment and Brainerd Currie's theory. We shall see, I believe, that what in all three systems appears as a revolution of conflicts doctrine bears in it- self, like all revolutions, a germ of counter-revolution. C.

It leaves open two all-important questions: "Which law's connection is then the more significant? Must there not be some basis for preferring one law as against the other?" (pp. 7I-72). I have elsewhere attempted to show that the American Law Institute, with its proposed Tentative Draft, is about to render the legal profession as serious a disservice as it did with its original "Re- statement" of a nonexistent law, not only because of the second Restatement's futile and inconsistent theory,55 but also because of its many obsolete and at times even morally objectionable "rules." 56 Brainerd Currie's "governmental interests." Perhaps the most important difference between Cavers and Currie is the latter's renunciation, in the absence of congressional action, of rules for choice of law. This renunciation results from two main theses of Currie's teaching: choice of law is determined by the concerned states' "'governmental interests" in the reasonable application of their laws; and, since the judges are not equipped for weighing such interests, any forum's "legitimate" interest compels applica- tion of its own law.57 Cavers does not wish "wholeheartedly" (p. ioo) to join in the objections of others to the "loaded" concept of "governmental interests." 58 But, having reduced it to an innocuous meaning, he discounts it as "dispensable" (p. I02).

I02). I must admit that, in the light of this conclusion, I see little in Currie's theory that resembles Cavers's approach as to either method or result. And indeed, as to fundamental questions of choice of law, Cavers must concede that "Currie's method would provide no more clues . . . than does Restatement Sec- ond" (p. 75). As revealed by Cavers in their true meaning, governmental interests cannot serve as the basis for the judges' choice. Currie's pitiless sincerity did not evade this conclusion. And this is why he himself would have denied judges the power to make this choice. But this conclusion has proved unacceptable to both courts and writers. Chief Justice Traynor, perhaps Currie's most prominent and faithful judicial adherent, has expressly rejected that essential part of his theory.59 And as far as I can see, all courts 60 and writers 61 who have professed acceptance of Currie's interest language have transformed it by indulging in that very weighing and balancing of interests from which Currie refrained. Cavers, a vigorous proponent of judicial rule-making, must be counted among these heretics. With this transformation Currie lost not just a battle but his revolution. A balancing and weighing of his governmental inter- ests could not fail to reveal their vagueness, indeed emptiness, and with it the need for such new guides as Cavers's "prefer- ences." As we shall see, Currie sought to support his threatened structure by adding a third proposition which would instruct the judge to evaluate his state's interest "altruistically" in the light of foreign interests.

Cavers's stated aim is to examine "a possible, principled approach to the choice-of- law process that will help to allay at least some of the fears of a threatening return to obsolete doctrine" (p. I5). He expects to reach this aim by finding "principles of preference" "with pur- poses that can be identified and evaluated, principles that can serve as premises from which specific results can be derived in concrete cases" (p. 209). The common ground on which this undertaking is built has been explored earlier. In particular Cavers's "non-system" (e.g., pp. I89, I98) of "principles of preference" is characterized by his rejection of all theories based on such abstract formulas as an exclusive regard for weighed or unweighed interests, or party expectations,63 or an overemphasis on the law of the forum.64 Most important, however, to stress it again, is Cavers's repeated statement that his preferences are not "academic" (p. 204) but formulated as "guides" ultimately, through a "process of fission [to] be converted into a set of specific rules." "5 For having adopted a similar technique Cavers gives generous credit to Bax- ter and Briggs (pp. 209-I3) and could, by the same token, have mentioned Binder, Bourel, Delachaux, and Stromholm 66 who, in the same field of tort conflicts, have offered related attempts at formulating existing and desirable principles of choice. Having "disposed" earlier of Cavers's contracts principles, I might be expected now fully to state and analyze the remaining five principles of preference offered by him for tort conflicts. But, in view of the importance of Cavers's new work, we may hope for its detailed discussion by others less preoccupied with its posi- tion and meaning in relation to contemporary cases and writings. 62 For other criticism of Currie's teaching see works cited supra note 3. f3 Pp. 207 n.iI, 302; Cavers, Oral Contracts To Provide by Will and the Choice-of-Law Process: Some Notes on Bernkrant, in PERSPECTIVES OF LAW: EssAYs FOR AUSTiN WAKEMAN SCOTT 38, 48-53 (I964). 64 Cavers, Some of Ehrenzweig's Choice-of-Law Generalizations, i8 OKLA.

An illustration will have to carry the burden of proof. Cavers in his first Preference says in part that "where the liability laws of the state of injury set a higher standard of conduct or of finan- cial protection against injury than do the laws of the state where the person causing the injury . . . had his home, the laws of the state of injury should determine the standard and the protection applicable to the case, at least where the person injured was not so related to the person causing the injury that the question should be relegated to the law governing their relationship" (p. '39). Assume two students permanently domiciled in Colorado who, while going to school in New York, are involved in an automobile accident in that state in which one is injured through the negli- gence of the other, the driver-host. Suit is brought in Colorado whose guest statute, in contrast to the common law of New York, limits the host's liability to wilful negligence. In the contrary situation where a Colorado accident befalls two New York stu- dents temporarily resident in Colorado and suit is brought in New York, Cavers finds the Dym holding of the New York Court of Appeals that the Colorado rule should be applied 67 in accord with his above principle of preference (p. 300). Under the court's analysis of this case, the Colorado court in my hypothetical would probably have to apply the common law of New York, where the relationship was entered. Cavers would apparently agree. New York's standard of conduct and financial protection was higher than that of Colorado; the plaintiff had his "home" 68 in New York for the present purpose; and New York law was also the law governing the relationship between host and guest. Few Colorado lawyers or insurers would approve the result. Would Professor Cavers? 69 67Dym v. Gordon, i6 N.Y.2d I20, 20 N.E.2d 792, 262 N.Y.S.2d 463 (I965). 68 On the difficulty of applying this concept see pp. 154-56. Abroad the same difficulties have been encountered with the new concept of "habitual residence." 69 In a letter commenting on a draft of this paper, Professor Cavers answered my question with an emphatic: "He certainly would."</page><page sequence="16">392 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80:377 I agree with Max Rheinstein that the principal difficulty lies in the fact that all modern writers, including the authors of Restate- ment Second and Brainerd Currie, have retained the statutists' fiction of a foreign law or state "claiming" attention.70 Cavers, too, adheres to this fiction when he insists on speaking of an "in- terested forum" (e.g., p. I23) or, for that matter, when he ap- proves of a search for the "reasonable" application of a foreign law without having chosen that law by resort to either a super-law or the forum's "purposes" (e.g., p. I20). Indeed, Cavers even stresses his "belief that the court must view its task in terms of a choice between competing rules of law." 71 But he can claim the probably unique merit of having transcended abstract formulas by articulating concrete "preferences" which, in their last ana- lysis, must be preferences of a forum judge.72 He also seems to approve of my suggestion that foreign policies must be, and often are, examined in the light of the forum's policy (pp. 9I n.I3, 94 n.2 i). And he, too, as we shall see, has his part in the "'counter-revolution." II. THE "COUNTER-REVOLUTION" To repeat: What appears to many as a revolution in American conflicts law is in fact limited to the law of torts. Even this local revolution was an uneasy one and created new unease, per- haps foreshadowing a counter-revolution. This appears when we juxtapose and analyze the many signs of hesitancy, compromise, and retreat in literature and case law. Both Cavers (p. 72) and Currie have noted that the Restate- ment (Second) is burdened by much of its fundamentalist heri- tage. That this is true even in the newly "freed" field of torts appears from the general "rule" that "in an action for a personal injury, the local law of the state where the injury occurred deter- mines the rights and liabilities of the parties . . . ." 73 7 Rheinstein, How To Review a Festschrift, II AM.

But see p. 302 n.Ig, where Cavers acknowledges the "anthropomorphism" involved in speaking of another state's "concern"; Cavers, supra note 64, at 359 n.6, where he considers the phrase "claim to application" to be "either a harmless redundancy or a moderately useful and not inappropriate metaphor." 72 He has been followed in this respect by Leflar, Choice-Influencing Con- siderations in Conflicts Law, 4I N.Y.U.L.

In the field of torts the Dym case with its Savignian emphasis on the seat of the parties' relationship offers a perfect example.74 So does Tramontana 71 with its exclusive regard for the truly gov- ernmental interest of the country in which the accident occurred. Where courts have attempted thus to save the revolution by retreat and retrenchment, they have succumbed to one of two hazards. They have either reached highly questionable results, as did the New York Court of Appeals in the Haag case and the Fourth Circuit in the Lowe case,76 where perhaps justified ulterior motivations were hidden behind a seemingly mechanical counting of contacts. Or they have simply yielded "to appeals, sometimes nostalgic, sometimes vehement, for a return to the orthodoxy of the first Restatement" (p. I2i), as several courts did as late as I965 and I966.77 It seems of the greatest significance that Brainerd Currie, justly credited by many with having given the decisive impetus to the "revolution," in effect recanted in his later works.

But Currie was not will- ing to pay the price and conceded applicability of foreign law wherever forum law permits such application under a "moderate and restrained interpretation" of its policy.78 As Cavers con- vincingly demonstrates, this concession confronts the courts "with an exacting task for which instructions have not been furnished" (p. 208 n.I5). Or, to put it less charitably, the one value of Currie's analysis, that of relative certainty, has been destroyed, and choice of law has been restored to the ancient role so strongly deplored in Currie's earlier writings. As we have seen, Cavers shares the revolutionary conviction that the fundamentalist order was ready for destruction. But we have also seen that, in conscious contrast to Currie's denigra- tion of rules of choice of law, he sees the scholar's primary task in helping legislatures and courts to develop new rules of choice. And it is for this purpose that he has offered us his principles of preference. But Cavers candidly admits that in this undertaking he has had to take recourse to what will appear at least super- ficially as a "territorialist" approach (p. I39), one "in terms and in style . . . painfully reminiscent of the Restatement black letter" (p. I36). Indeed, not only does emphasis on the law of "the state of injury" and conduct (principles I, 2, 3, 5) or the law of the center of the transaction (principle 6) or of the situs (principle 7) repeat the two Restatements' territorial formulas in conscious reminiscence of Savigny (pp. 4, I66), but the "per- sonal law" concept of a "law governing [the parties'] relation- ship" (principles I, 2) and the reference to "a state in which a relationship has its seat" returns us so thoroughly to earlier stages of conflicts law that we are not surprised also to find fraude d loi in the exceptions provided for "facts that . . . had been ma- nipulated to evade the protective law" (principle 6) and for the effect of "mandatory rules of the situs of the land" (principle 7). If Cavers's Preferences tend to serve some of the certainties lost with the "revolution," I can perhaps claim that I have con- sciously yielded to the same need. Though starting, like Currie, with the interpretation of the forum rule, I have, like Cavers, attempted to find actual and desirable preferences of courts for 78E.g., Currie, The Disinterested Third State, 28 LAW &amp; CONTEMP.

But unlike Currie and Cavers, I have in the first place attempted to gain guidance from a rein- terpretation of a multitude of cases in the existing law, and in the second place found it easier and more promising to develop my principles of preferences as exceptions to a basic application of forum rules rather than as rules applicable a priori as issuing from a state "reasonably" or "legitimately" "concerned" or "in- terested." 79 In stating my preferences I have attempted instead to rely on such psychological factors as the "presumption of validity" applied to legal transactions freely entered into by adults, or on such economic realities as the availability and ex- pectability of insurance.80 In this technique, too, there may be seen a return to a desire for predictable solutions. Recent ex- periences may require further search and endeavor to secure fruitful evolution in this direction. III. EVOLUTION? As we have seen, there are many areas of the law where the solution of conflicts problems has found a stable pattern. Con- flicts theory is thus properly concerned only with those areas in which changing tensions of domestic law impose new choices based on changing values. "Revolutionary" conflicts doctrine has, therefore, been virtually limited to the law of obligations, and the effects of that doctrine can be narrowed further. The conflicts law of contracts, like the domestic law in that field, has always required and found solutions seeking the parties' in- tention, and has thus presented few practical problems. More- over, the law of "moral" torts has remained close to its ancestor or sibling, the law of crimes, with its emphasis on the law of the forum. There remains as the primary testing ground of conflicts theory the very recent institution of enterprise liability. '9 According to Cavers, supra note 64, at 359, my repeated assurance that in this structure, " 'the lex fori has primacy only analytically' confounds the con- fusion." I have tried to clarify any confusion that I may have caused earlier. Ehrenzweig, A Proper Law in a Proper Forum: A "Restatement" of the "Lex Fori Approach," i8 OKLA. L. REV. 340-44 (I965). That in tort conflicts law the lex fori has always played a decisive role is easily established. See TREATISE ? 2II. In the British Commonwealth, forum law has preserved its historical primacy. 80 For searching criticism and indeed refinement of my suggestion see Cavers, supra note 64, at 363-65.

Any choice between such equally "unjust" laws will be unsatisfactory in its result not be- cause conflicts law has failed the judge but because both laws between which the choice must be made are objectionable. Yet, though reform is around the corner, until it has occurred, judges will have to make the fatal choice. All we have to start from is the common ground described earlier: our agreement that we are dealing with foreign rules rather than laws; that we are usually not concerned with interests of governments but almost always only with the interests of pri- vate parties; that we must proceed from an interpretation of rules (in my opinion our own rules) and must do so on the basis of the policies or purposes underlying these rules (both those legis- latively and those judicially declared). I might add that we must follow Cavers in seeking a much more refined policy analysis than that usually offered, a policy analysis supplemented by many other considerations (pp. I08-09). Beyond these agreements we are met by a somewhat incongru- ous battle of emotions and language. We should be wary of dis- counting this battle too readily. Where minds have clashed as emo- tionally and pervasively as they have for centuries in the law of conflicts of laws, we must seek a psychological source likely to be deeper than that appearing in argument. Elsewhere I have tried to test this assumption with regard to the age-old fight between moralizing adherents of natural law and "cynical" partisans of positivism; 82 between those who clamor for a "just" compen- sation of the "innocent" tort victim and those who insist on the "just" protection of the "innocent" tortfeasor; 83 and between those who want, for the sake of justice, to replace punishment with cure and those who insist on the moral fiber of our criminal law.84 81 I do not believe that Cavers (pp. I30-33) gains much for his principles of preference from Rawls's study of "justice as fairness."

We might then, in this minuscule and relatively unimportant context, learn to understand those necessarily irreconcilable "justices" which follow us from earliest childhood, competing with each other in ever-varying patterns. We might recognize the father's effort to create justice between the siblings in the "constitutionalist's" and "internationalist's" persevering faith in super-law solutions; our respect for the sibling's "vested rights" on grounds of "equal- ity" or fear of retaliation in the Restatement's legislative "juris- dictions"; our aesthetic urges for symmetry and order in "altruis- tic" or "symmetric" 85 interpretations of the forum's own rights and ambitions, interests and preferences; ancient territorial in- stincts in our compulsive adherence to a land taboo; 86 and finally the resigned recognition of our own selves' overpowering, irra- tional demands, tempered only by rational concessions to the community, in the "lex fori approach," attempting to isolate and explain applications of foreign rules. Should we not have the courage to admit to ourselves that such rational resignations and rational concessions are the very bases of our lives in families and communities? If we transplant this courage to the narrow confines of our present concern, our quest must be to isolate ra- tional grounds for limiting the irrational preference for our own rule. Such grounds are varied, some readily acceptable, others opposed to our "ideals" and therefore largely kept under the surface. Let us begin with the latter. The better law. -There is what Cavers has called the "fact of life" (p. 85) that judges have always tended toward the ap- plication of that forum or foreign rule which in their opinion, to use Hancock's phrase, "best accords with present-day ideas of justice and convenience." 87 To be sure, to recognize that of Criminal Responsibility and Insanity in the Death Cell, 73 YALE L.J. 425 (I964), revised, CRim.

But it is quite feasible for periods of transition to accept rules of choice which will en- able the judge to prefer his own or a foreign rule as the "better" one in particular cases.88 Suppose that a guest statute or a chari- table immunity has been recognized by the courts of a state as the mere product of a strong insurance lobby unconcerned with social realities and needs. Why should these courts not adopt a rule of choice enabling them to apply the better rule of either their own or another state, provided that rule can reasonably be ap- plied as that of the state of the defendant's or plaintiff's home or of some other contact relevant under the policy of the forum? That such motivations have determined many rulings involving such obsolescent laws as married women's incapacities, statutes of frauds, or Sunday laws can hardly be denied.89 And it seems significant that admiralty courts, with their usual candor, have occasionally been willing to admit their emotional preference.90 I do not believe that "avoidance of that ground of preference . should constitute one of the chief claims to recognition of princi- ples of preference." I see, not a "constant invitation to paro- chialism" (pp. I22-23), but on the contrary a chance for pro- gressive courts to prepare a reform of their domestic law by a judicious selection of better rules. Perhaps the doctrine of adhe- sion contracts or the concept of enterprise liability would have found less secure and prompt adoption in "parochial" reform if conflicts law had not paved the way. And the Massachusetts limitation on wrongful death damages may ultimately owe its expected demise to its clashes with more progressive jurisdictions. We owe thanks to Chief Justice Kenison who, following Cavers and Leflar, has courageously admitted as a basis of choice "the court's preference [too often disgused] for what it regards as the sounder rule of law, as between two competing ones."

But foreign doctrine has developed a re- lated concept which permits the judge to adjust a domestic or foreign rule in certain situations to make it applicable without injustice to the foreign facts, particularly where the conflicts rule would lead to a result different from that reached under either law.92 Even if introduced in American practice, the neces- sarily limited applicability of this technique would still leave us with the fundamental problem. And this would equally be true for that other theoretical structure which has been offered abroad as one of a "supplementary substantive law." 9 Return to territoriality? - We might decide with Cavers that the territoriality principle tempered by certain instances of personal law should remain our starting point as substantiating an analysis based on a weighing of interests or significant con- tacts. We might concede that this ancient principle has remained "unshaken"94 in continental Europe and has thus proved its feasibility even within such closely knit communities as the Com- mon Market.95 And, indeed, in the conflicts law of torts we may have to acquiesce in such a solution until the irrepressible reform of enterprise liability will have enabled us to resort to more ra- tional approaches. But if we resign ourselves to this temporary solution, we shall have to reverse a typically American attitude which has puzzled many foreign observers. We shall have to abandon our disinclination to resort to public policy in order to reintroduce our own law where the "governing" foreign law is not acceptable.96 Why should not the Babcock court97 have 92 G.

And indeed, the formulas used may closely resemble those used in traditional conflicts law.'03 But I believe we have started on our way and should proceed along it. A compromise? - Most promising, however, seems a com- bination of the last two approaches: basic applicability of the forum rule in the proper forum and recognition of an ever-growing 98Dym v.

I continue to believe that the courts' conscious resort to the validating law in conflicts cases involving contracts, conveyances, and wills may, with narrowly circumscribed excep- tions based on public policy, ultimately become such a rule of choice. And in the conflicts law of torts, such new rules may be in the making as those choosing the law of the garage in guest statute cases; 104 the "lex communis," the law of the common domicile, in cases involving persons belonging to the same group; 105 or the law of the forum as to certain questions of procedural capacity and damages.'06 In the recognition and def- inition of similar inchoate rules, Cavers's search for principles of preference will be of invaluable help. 104 TREATISE ? 220; Ehrenzweig, Guest Statutes in the Conflicts of Laws - Towards a Theory of Enterprise Liability Under "Foreseeable and Insurable Laws," 69 YALE L.J. 595 (I960). 105 pp. 150-59. Chief Justice Kenison has taken this approach in Johnson v. Johnson, 2i6 A.2d 78i (N.H. i966), in giving preference (in partial and guarded reliance on Cavers's Choice-of-Law Process) to the interspousal immunity rule of the parties' Massachusetts domicile over the contrary rule of the forum and place of accident. While insisting that the court had given due consideration to the "purposes of the respective state laws here in conflict," he announced a juris- diction-selecting rule applying the lex domicilii.
