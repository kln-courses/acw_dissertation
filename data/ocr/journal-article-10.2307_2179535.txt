ACADEMIC circles in Japan annually commemorate the lives of four sages: Buddha, Confucius, Plato and Kant. Nothing is allowed to interfere with the regular observance of appropriate ceremonies in their honor. The prestige of the great K6nigsberger was not shaken even by the passions aroused during the recent war. On every twenty-second of April his contribution to the philosophical and cultural progress of 'mankind is con- sidered afresh and high tribute is paid to his achievements. Nowhere else perhaps does Kant occupy quite so exalted a position. Nevertheless, there is abundant evidence that he is almost everywhere throughout the civilized world regarded as a figure of central importance. Of him it cannot be said that he was or is without honor in his own land. On the contrary, along with Copernicus he constitutes the pride of his own beloved East Prussia, and Germany as a whole attaches a unique significance to his philosophical formulations in the second and third no less than in the first of his critiques. Far beyond the confines of philosophical or even academic groups, his doctrines continue to be discussed, and great interest prevails in all enterprises that relate in any way to him. Twenty of the thirty-five local branches of the Kantgesellschaft, and a majority of its five thousand members as well, are to be found in Germany. These groups regularly celebrate the recurrence of Kant's birthday, and this is commonly done also by other scientific and literary organi- zations, as well as by universities and gymnasia. Celebrations of outstanding importance occurred during i88i, the centenary of the Critique of Pure Reason. In Germany especially there had 28 433</page><page sequence="2">434 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIII. arisen an acute consciousness of the philosophical barrenness of the decades immediately preceding i88i and of the need of a philo- sophical recovery. In consequence, "Back to Kant" rapidly became a favorite slogan. Perhaps no stronger proof of Kant's greatness can be adduced than the fact that this return proved to be a return, not to a place of rest, but to a point of fresh departure, of embarkation upon promising exploration. Thus it came about that the twenty-three years preceding the centenary of Kant's death witnessed much zealous intellectual effort, resulting in a number of competing philosophical systems. There was fairly general agreement, however, in i904, as to the truth of the new slogans, " Von Kant aus, uiber Kant hinaus" and "Kant verstehen heiszt uiber ihn hinausgehen". But, as already suggested, by no means all advanced along the lines either of Rickert and Windel- band or of Lasson. Fichte received only slight attention, relatively speaking, and Hegel even less. Only thirteen years ago one of Berlin's most prominent philosophers, a distinguished student of the critical philosophy, expressed to the present writer his surprise that the works of Hegel still figured so prominently in the philosophical study and discussions of England and America. Had not German scholars long since laid them aside as misguided and barren? As regards Kant-celebrations, I924 marked the next pivotal year namely, the bicentenary of Kant's birth. The celebrations already held during this year, and further planned, doubtless exceed in number and magnitude those of all preceding an- niversaries. Various centres in Austria, Czecho-Slovakia, Denmark, England, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States, as well as in Japan and Germany, have arranged com- memorative exercises, as well as in Bucharest, Jerusalem, Pekin and Sofia. The International Congress of Philosophy in Naples set aside a special place on its program for a commemorative address, inviting, as the speaker, Professor Arthur Liebert, of the Kantgesellschaft. The bicentenary has given stimulus to the translation of Kant's writings into other languages, as, for example, of the Prolegomena into Roumanian. The Roumanian Philosophical Association, the Internationale Vereinigung fur Rechts- und Wirtschaftsphilosophie, the Albertusuniversitdt, and</page><page sequence="3">No. 5.1 THE KANTFEIER IN KONIGSBERG. 435 the Kantstudien are among those issuing Festschrifte of importance. The Philosophischer Almanach for I924 emphazises especially publications relating to the Kantian philosophy. In Germany, celebrations are announced in practically all universities and cultural centers, and a considerable number of extensive works and monographs have been called forth. Some of these throw added light on the K6nigsberg and East Prussia of Kant's day; others, on the details of Kant's life, as well as on the extra-aca- demic interests and influence of 'der elegante Magister.' These should put an end once for all to current erroneous impressions emanating from such accounts as the well-known description by Heine. In recent times there have come to light numerous letters both by and to Kant, various portraits of Kant in his earlier years, and a bust of Kant made in I 798 by the well-known sculptor, Emanuel Bardou. Those interested in these matters will find much valuable material and bibliographical guidance in recent biographies of Kant-best of all, in that by Vorlander - in the Philosophischer Almanach for I924, and in such publi- cations as the Kant and Schopenhauer number of the Ostdeutsche Monatshefte or the special Kant editions of the Kinigsberger Aligemeine Zeitung and the Kinigsberger Hartungsche Zeitung. Doubtless the most elaborate and generally interesting of the celebrations of the bicentennial of Kant's birth was that held in Konigsberg from April I9 to 23. The program of the first day was held in the Friedrichskollegium, in the present building of the school where Kant received his early training, and was in charge of the local organization of the Kantgesellschaft. Apparently one of the primary aims was to portray local influences and history in their bearing upon the formulation and the fortunes of Kant's philosophy. Perhaps this accounts for the curious-or should we frankly say naive and superficial?-character of the opening paper, entitled " Vom Heimatgeist in der Kantischen Philosophie." The writer, Professor Arnold Kowalewski of the local University, contended that if we are ever to secure a reasonable measure of agreement in the interpretation of Kant's philosophy we must consider it from new viewpoints; and one such viewpoint, he affirmed, was a clear recognition of the fact that the roots of Kant's personality were deeply imbedded in East Prussia-the</page><page sequence="4">436 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIII. land to which he was ever devotedly loyal and which he found so congenial in every way that he declined all solicitations to go elsewhere. Four outstanding features of the East Prussian spirit are: (i) Rugged simplicity, which finds expression in Kant's aversion to the 'poetic' and the 'prophetic' manners-declared by him to be as unsuited to philosophy as it is to the keeping of accounts; in his conception of philosophy as a search for clear-cut, carefully analyzed principles (note especially his essay on " Von einem neuerdings erhobenen vornehmen Ton in der Philosophie"); in the fact that his pages are not adorned with the symbols of higher mathematics but include only the simplest arithmetical illustrations; in his dislike of ecclesiastical pomp; and in his development of an extraordinarily profound interpretation of art on the basis of but a limited range of firsthand experiences of aesthetic objects; (2) Firmness, deep-seated dread of vacillation: note Kant's teaching of the fixity and the finality of the forms of the understanding, as of intuition, whatever may be the advances of science; the essential similarity of structure of his three critiques; his desire to substitute rational and unchangeable for historic articles of faith; his resentment when Fichte or others contrasted the spirit with the letter of his philosophy; (3) Love of totality and completeness: here one recalls Kant's insistence on the completeness of his classifications and lists, and on the adequacy of his method; his refusal to admit hypotheses into philosophy; and his argument for immortality on the ground that the moral life of man cannot remain fragmentary or unfini- shed; (4) Resolute activity and emphasis of practical interests: does this not furnish the simplest answer to the riddle as to how one who was reared in the thought and culture of rationalism could come to insist on the primacy of the practical reason? In striking contrast to this mode of argumentation was the second paper, by Dr. Otto Schoendoerffer, also of Konigsberg, on the topic, "Kinigsberger Kantstudien." Pointing out the fact that in K6nigsberg there was a rapid lapse of interest in the critical philosophy, beginning shortly after Kant's death and continuing for decades-in the university there was no course on it from i807 to i865, and no doctoral dissertation until seven years later-the writer dwelt in minute detail on the r6les played</page><page sequence="5">No. 5.] THE KANTFEIER IN KONIGSBERG. 437 by Rudolf Reicke and Emil Arnoldt in bringing the critical philosophy into the forefront and in contributing to our knowledge of it and of its founder. The third and final paper was a thoughtful discussion by Professor Arthur Liebert of Berlin of the subject, "Kant und die geschichtlziche Weltansicht." In the face of our vastly widened historical horizon and of the varied considerations making for historicism, can we still justify the Kantian conception of absolute principles of reason? Can we accept ethical norms as absolutely valid, and any values as eternal? Is there stark opposition or can we find a modus vivendi between a temporalistic, historical world- view and the outlook of the critical philosophy?--such were the problems attacked. In the last analysis, it was argued, they depend upon the question as to the relation of the principle of autonomy to that of tradition and authority. Now history itself presupposes self-conscious, self-directed, free and responsible activity. A denial of the latter-and such is involved in a repudiation of Kantianism-destroys the very possibility of history. For history, in contrast with nature, cannot be resolved into an empirically determined succession of events. Nor can the basis, as distinguished from the law, of history be found in causal determination. We cannot construe the concept or participate in the process of history without employing norms presupposing freedom; the oft-repeated contention that the Kantian philosophy laid the basis simply for the natural sciences to the neglect of historical disciplines is therefore radically untenable. What the first critique does for the former, the ethics does for the latter. To be Kantians means to realize that we are more than beings involved in a nexus of natural processes. In the metaphysical sense of the term, it means that we judge the empirical facts of life by the norm of freedom, and to this, Professor Liebert con- tended, we are today more than ever committed. The morning and afternoon meetings of the second day were held under the auspices of the central organization of the Kantgesellschaft in the Palaestra Albertina-a building, we may note in passing, that was given to the University by an American and is devoted to the physical development of the students. The writer being prevented by ill health from coming, Professor</page><page sequence="6">438 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIII. Hans Vaihinger's introductory paper on "Kant in der deutschen Philosophize der Gegenwart" was read by his colleague, Professor Liebert. The spirit of Kant's philosophy, it insisted, remains forever young; today it manifests itself, in one way or another, in all the significant philosophical formulations and tendencies of Germany. True, it often seems that movements away from Kant are on the increase and we now not infrequently hear the cry, "Los von Kant und von seinem Subjektivismus, zurick zum Object." Those who think thus see in Kant only the Alleszer- maimer to the neglect of the numerous elements he has provided for a critical metaphysics. But even in these cases the doctrines, viewpoints or method of Kant are in clear evidence. Dilthey, and more recently Gross and Spranger, have concerned them- selves with determining the number and nature of the funda- mental types of philosophical thought as grounded in the nature of man. But Kant paved the way for such inquiry, however unsatisfactory may have been his contention that these are three in number: dogmatism, scepticism and criticism. Voluntaristic systems have their source in Kant, as have the philosophies of value espoused by Rickert and Windelband in development of the thought of Lotze. Even the apparently antipodal fictionalism, or "Philosophie des Als-Ob," arising under the stimulus of Friedrich Albert Lange, continues certain Kantian tendencies and elaborates what Kant had in mind in his account of the transcen- dental ideas. Much more obvious is the indebtedness to Kant of Cohen, Natorp, Cassirer, and the entire Marburger school, as well as that of Eucken. For the specific lines of influence in each case, the limits of our space compel us to refer the interested reader to the paper itself, presently to appear in the Kantstudien; but, for the benefit of those wishing an outline of current philo- sophical tendencies in Germany, we cite the further movements referred to by Professor Vaihinger, namely: Troeltsch's meta- physics of religion and of history; personalism (Stern); phe- nomenology (Husserl, Scheler); neo-vitalism (Driesch); spiritu- alism. In connection with his reference to the last-mentioned of these, the writer maintained that one of the many errors gene- rated by Kuno Fischer is the belief that with his "Trdume eines Geistersehers" Kant, in I766, settled these problems in his</page><page sequence="7">No. 5.] THE KANTFEIER IN KONIGSBERG. 439 own mind and definitively laid them aside. Such was not the case. His doctrines of time and, more especially, of space reflect the influence of Swedenborg; and a number of his lectures, as du Prel has convincingly shown, contain suggestions of a spiritualistic mysticism. The second topic of the day, "Kant und Herder," was discussed by Professor Eugen Kifhnemann with the impassioned oratory characteristic of him even in philosophical discourses. A vivid account of the personal relations of the two men and of Kant's crushing criticisms of Herder's Philosophy of History led to a description of the nature and the value, respectively, of intuitive and logical apprehension, and to the conclusion that our objective should be their union-that Herder and Kant must be regarded as supplementing each other. The succeeding paper, "Kants Erbe," by Professor Erich Adickes, called attention to the bitter quarrels which continue down to the present over the questions as to the real nature of Kant's legacy and as to who today is his legitimate heir. While agreement as to the latter point is precluded by reason of the subjective factor involved-namely, judgments as to what elements of Kant's doctrines are most pertinent to and significant for current problems--the case is quite otherwise, it was urged, with the first question, for this is purely historical in character. The difficulty in the past has been that interpreters have not been willing, with entire openmindedness, to have Kant tell his story in his own way. They have treated him not as he is in himself, but as the inaugurator or forerunner of this or that subsequent movement or thinker; they have emphasized disproportionately, or even to the neglect of all else, one or the other of the critiques or even strands within a critique; they have simply utilized elements of the critical philosophy for purposes of independent construction; indeed, they have even capitalized Kant in the interests of their own philosophic prepossessions. Generally, moreover, minute investigation into what as an actual matter of fact is contained in the writings of a philosopher-and so also of Kant-has been depreciated. This is a serious misfortune, for such investigations are of great value, even philosophically. As little else, they supply strength and maturity to the growing</page><page sequence="8">440 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIII. mind. Moreover, only by giving oneself unreservedly to the object of investigation, and especially by identifying oneself for the time being not so much with the one or the other book as, through this, with the living individuality expressed therein, can one estimate the potency of non-logical or of unconscious factors in philosophical construction; only thus, understand how philo- sophical doctrines and systems arise, and thus judge whether, as Hegel taught, they represent the self-realization, in strict logical necessity, of absolute reason or whether they are interrelated only in quite other ways. Having indicated the diverse strains which he himself discerns in the Kantian writings, Dr. Adickes made an earnest plea for cooperative investigations designed to bring about agreement as to what the critiques actually do teach. He urged as the first topic of inquiry the doctrine of the thing-in-itself, and announced that, as his contribution, he is about to publish a brochure bringing together all the more important passages relevant to a discovery of what Kant, as a matter of fact, said and thought with respect to this central concept. Professor Hans Driesch's paper on "Kant und die Ganzheit" centered about a concept but partially recognized in the critiques, and never clearly differentiated from related concepts. True, Kant's account of his work as a genuine system involves the conception of wholeness, but only in its logical connotation; the discussion of the categories brings the conception within purview, yet without sharp distinction from that of unity; further, the conception is suggested in the analysis of the ontological proof for the existence of God and yet again, and more particularly, in the third critique, especially in the closing chapter, in the discussion of the intellectus archetypes, but here the conceptions of 'whole' and of 'universal' are constantly confused, as are, in general, the relations of part to whole, particular to universal, and species to genus. The conception is frequently equated to or conjoined with that of teleology. In the case of the latter, various conno- tations appear: (i) Subjective, signifying, for example, the fact that the objects and processes of nature are classifiable, that what is given fits into, and thus harmonizes with, the logical activities of reason, and that certain objects of nature and of art</page><page sequence="9">No. 5.1 THE KANTFEIER IN KONIGSBERG. 441 correspond with requirements of the spirit in such a way that they are experienced as beautiful; (II) objective, either, (i) formal- e.g., some geometrical figures are serviceable in solving certain problems-or (2) material, and this in the sense of (a) organicity, the distinctive nature of a living being, (b) adaptiveness of certain objects for the uses or needs of others-e.g., of plants for the food of animals, or (c) purposiveness of nature. What was Kant's attitude with respect to these various teleological con- ceptions? What, more specifically, to the one appearing as (II, 2, a)-was he a mechanist or a vitalist? Careful collation and study of the relevant passages leaves one in doubt, due primarily, perhaps, to the fact that no clear-cut demarcation is made between static teleology and dynamic teleology-the relations exemplified, respectively, by the parts of a machine and by the members of an organism. Is teleology, in Kant's doctrine, a category, a constitutive conception? He contends that the conception is indispensable for an adequate comprehension or description- of living beings. Why, then, does he not include it in his table of categories? Why even contrast it, as occurs in the third critique, with the categories? The following answers suggest themselves: the failure to distinguish carefully between various types of teleology; the erroneous notion that teleology is inseparable from metaphysics; the fact that dynamic factors are not intuitable, and that the various aspects of time were already all called into use in connection with the schemata so that no schema could be adduced for the teleological relation; the fear of anthropomorphism, inasmuch as the teleological concept ap- parently has its source in volitional experiences. Vitalism, however, remains untouched by these considerations, for it may restrict itself to the contention-demonstrable, it was urged, on the ground of empirical facts-that living beings possess certain characteristics which distinguish them so basically from inorganic things that they are intelligible only through the employment of non-mechanical conceptions, of the principle or category of teleology in a dynamic as distinguished from a mechanical connotation. The fifth and final paper of the program arranged by the Kantgesellschaft was by Professor Heinrich Scholz, a philosopher</page><page sequence="10">442 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIII. of the "Als-Ob" school, who, in elaboration of a point touched upon in Professor Vaihinger's essay, discussed "Kant der Klas- siker der Metaphysik." The writer obviously realized that he was on dangerous ground. A strong group of German philos- ophers emphatically reject all interpretations of Kant that savor of metaphysics. In private conversation-for the papers were all very extended and the programs provided no opportunity for discussion from the floor-some had already voiced the criticism that the K6nigsberg programs gave undue prominence to the metaphysical wing of the interpreters of Kant. What is one's justification, Professor Scholz began by asking, for referring to the greatest of all critics of metaphysics as a classical meta- physicist? We find it in a guarded and yet thoroughly acceptable definition of the two terms. Let us mean by a classicist a thinker from whom one may constantly learn, however widely one may differ; and by metaphysics, a concern with problems that are at once intelligibly formulated and ultimate, and that cannot be dealt with, or at any rate adequately solved, by the resources of epistemology, physics or psychology, but compel, or at least invite, speculative treatment-remembering also that the doctrines of metaphysics, no less truly than those of the exact sciences, must be derived from axioms, and that, while the basic system of axioms, and it alone, is hypothetical, it must, on the one hand, have its orientation in experience and, on the other, be free from self-contradiction. When the terms are thus defined, it must be conceded that Kant belongs to the classical metaphysi- cists, for: (I) He was the first great thinker since Aristotle to include among the fundamental tasks of philosophy the problem as to whether the physical world is finite or infinite as regards its spatial and temporal attributes-a contribution of the very first importance, and leading to significant 'analyses, even though the conception of infinity employed has since been superseded; (2) He was the first to interpret the good will as the revelation of the Absolute and thus as a fact of supreme metaphysical significance a doctrine with which one is compelled to reckon seriously, however defective may be Kant's particular formulation, whether in details or in principle; (3) He introduced into philosophy the significant set of questions bearing on the relation of values to the</page><page sequence="11">No. 5.1 THE KANTFEIER IN KONIGSBERG. 443 world of fact; (4) His contention that we can have knowledge of sense objects only in so far as they satisfy certain abstract con- ditions, more particularly the postulate of causal determination, is indeed unsatisfactorily supported, and yet the discussion remains a challenge to deeper reflection concerning the puz- zling question as to the "pre-established harmony between nature and spirit" and inevitably forces one to enter the domain of metaphysics. The main program of the third day, April 2I, centered about the dedication of a newly completed mausoleum. This covers a sarcophagus which, in turn, rests over the spot, adjoining the Domkirche, to which the remains of Kant were moved, some few years after their burial elsewhere, on February 24, i804. The earlier burial chapel had even many years ago fallen into such disrepair that Rosenkranz likened it to a Bretterbude. In other ways also K6nigsberg was for years guilty of extreme carelessness and disregard. After Kant's death nothing was done to prevent his personal belongings or other mementoes and articles of historic interest from being scattered to the four winds; and only within a generation the city (and university) stood quietly by while the house of Kant was torn down to make way for a business block. In recent years the city has sought to make atonement. It has made strenuous efforts to locate and to acquire for the Kant museum-established in a room across from the mausoleum-everything still available. On the whole, however, the results are disappointing. Considering Kant's great fame during his lifetime, the relative recency of his death, and the fact that his entire activity fell within a small radius, there is but extremely little in K6nigsberg that exhibits his tastes, habits or appearance at the various periods of his life. How are we to account for this, and for the fact, earlier mentioned, that, beginning almost with his death, his philosophy for decades received but slight attention in the university which he had so long and so illustriously served? In partial answer one might refer to the harassing political events which immediately after i804 diverted to themselves a great part of the thought and the activity of K6nigsberg; and to the fact that the return of more normal conditions of life already found the Hegelian thought</page><page sequence="12">444 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIII. supreme, while subsequently, in reaction, intellectual interests turned from philosophy to the empirical sciences. But in i804 there could be no doubt as to Kant's exceptional place in the esteem and affection of his community. Town and gown joined in an immense funeral procession while all the church bells of the city tolled a tribute of respect. Similarly the recent dedication of the new mausoleum proved an extraordinarily impressive occasion. Though there was a cold drizzle, with occasional gusts of wind, the concourse of people was such that the police were compelled to barricade the streets in front of the Domkirche. Those who were fortunate enough to have cards of admission could not enter the immense mediaeval structure without a feeling of solemnity and a sense of the historic signifi- cance of the occasion. To organ accompaniment the festal procession moved slowly down the central aisle: city, provincial and national officials, representatives of the various Orden, with their insignia and silken banners, visiting rectors of universities, the faculty of Kant's university, the university Pedelle followed by the local rector, distinguished scholars-all in academic or other distinctive costume. The head of K6nigsberg's school system, Dr. Stettiner, graphically sketched the influences which, on the one hand, played upon Kant and, on the other radiated from him to transform not merely philosophic thought but, through the instrumentality of followers, the military, municipal and educational institutions of Prussia, if not of all Germany. The climax of the day, and, to many, of the entire celebration, came with the address by Professor Adolf von Harnack. With great dignity and genuine eloquence, the venerable scholar outlined the scientific personality of Kant, the directions and significance of his thought, and finally his effect upon history. Objectivity, seriousness, industry, zeal for investigation, with a constant regard for the manifold and diverse bearings of facts and their place within the whole of experience, moral earnestness and dignity-these having been his outstanding traits, Kant might fittingly be called the St. Francis of science. The most significant advances registered by the last quarter of the eighteenth century and subsequently, whether in our scientific or our ethical Kultur, are the reflections of Kant on the two questions to which he</page><page sequence="13">No. 5.] THE KANTFEIER IN KONIGSBERG. 445 devoted the greater part of his intellectual energies: Under what conditions may we lay claim to genuine knowledge?, and can we justify man's conviction that in his ethical experience he trans- cends the sphere of nature? The best of Kant's contemporaries derived from the critical philosophy not merely contributions to thought but also deeper and finer appreciations of the worth of man. Under Kant's influence much of what was antiquated in philosophical and ecclesiastical creeds disappeared, while much that was satisfying and had seemed true received thorough justification. Kant aroused kings in philosophy (Fichte, Shelling, Hegel, Schopenhauer and others) and in the special sciences as well. At the conclusion of Professor von Harnack's address, the assembly proceeded to the mausoleum where there were further exercises, much more simple in character but none the less memorable. The Begriiszungsabend in the city hall proved a delightful occasion. Music by a well directed symphony orchestra, and later, after the program, a reception, greatly enhanced the joy of the evening. In welcoming the guests, the Oberbfirgermeister, Dr. Lohmeyer, described the K6nigsberg of Kant's day and referred to the role played by the doctrines, students and followers of Kant in the revival of Prussia after the Napoleonic wars and in bringing about municipal self-government. It was a serious disappointment that President Ebert, who had tenatively accepted a place on the program, was prevented by official duties from doing more than sending a brief letter, and that Chancellor Marx was likewise unable to be present. The guests were privileged, however, to hear addresses by Dr. Jarres, of the German cabinet, and by Herr Braun, Ministerprdsident (cor- responding to our Governor) of Prussia. The former described the sobering influence directly or indirectly emanating from Kant at a time of political turmoil and social confusion, when the older autocratic regime had broken down and nebulous ideas of cosmopolitanism were interfering with sane, progressive political thought. Kant's categorical imperative put iron into the blood of his people. His insistence that true politics must follow in the train of morality more than ever needs to be heeded. In internal politics, groups must acquire a greater respect for the convictions</page><page sequence="14">446 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIII. of one another and, laying aside bitterness and harshness, culti- vate a reasonable tolerance. In the matter of foreign relations, only a right about face on the part of the nations, and an accep- tance of Kant's principle, can prevent a disaster of unimaginable seriousness. During the fourth day of the celebration, April 22, the star rOle was taken by the University. The decorations of the municipal theatre and the groupings on the stage of the various bodies of faculty, student Orden, guests and speakers were most impressive. In opening the program, the rector, Dr. Ukeley, spoke of those aspects of Kant's personality and achievements which would have made it inappropriate to give the celebration simply a local character. The Prussian Minister of Art, Science and Education, Dr. Boelitz, referred to the official reprimand once administered to Kant because of certain religious teachings, and then added that the two persons who had done most in revealing, as well as in moulding, the Prussian spirit were Frederick the Great and Kant. Kant was an educator of the first order. The wreath with which Prussia this year wished to honor him is the improvement of her school system. The modifications now undertaken aim more satisfactorily to effect liberation from dogmatism and to promote, in complete harmony, freedom and law, personality and com- munity, the national life and the well-being of humanity. Pro- fessor Albert Goedekemeyer, who at present occupies Kant's chair in the University, followed with a beautifully simple and clean-cut exposition of the main lines of Kant's thought. After an hour's recess and some choral music, Professor C. H. Becker, an orientalist of distinction, at present in the German cabinet, raised the question whether the average educated man of today finds in Kant more than an historical figure and whether Kant still lives as a factor in the cultural life of Germany and of mankind. His answer was that, while many technical philos- ophers were still under the influence of Kant, neither Kant nor his followers find appreciable response in the larger world. To the literary circles of the twentieth century, Nietzsche, Bergson, and perhaps Dilthey are what Kant was to Schiller. Hence prevalent philosophies of life proclaim the unity of the realm of values and the world of fact, and regard philosophy, not as a</page><page sequence="15">No. 5.] THE KANTFEIER IN KONIGSBERG. 447 criticism or a conceptual interpretation of life, or as a reflection on life, but as an immediate, intuitive appropriation of life. The prevailing reaction against abstract rationalism flows not in the channels prepared by Kant but in the direction of anti-rational- ism. Deplorable as the fact is, the reason becomes clear when we realize that the current movements in popular thought spring from practical sources: what we have is at bottom an emphatic repudiation of an excessively mechanized, abstractly rational social and industrial system, finding or accepting theoretical formulations true to its own impulsive and violent spirit. With- out disregarding the values herein involved, we need again to appropriate certain Kantian insights-need to realize the basic value of a thoughtful, critical attitude, of a freedom informed by reason, and of truth in the sense of judgments grounded not in subjective considerations but in universal laws of logic and of reason. The critical spirit and reverence, the two poles of the Kantian philosophy, must become more potent. But, in the last analysis, it is doubtless true that new salvation comes alone from new love. True to the spirit also of Kant is the word which Hoelderlin has put into the mouth of Socrates: " Wer das Tiefste gedacht, liebt das Lebendigste." Seven brief congratulatory addresses were delivered on behalf of as many types of educational and scientific organizations in Germany, and thirteen by represen- tatives from foreign countries, the present writer having the honor to present the greetings of the American Philosophical Association and addresses from Cornell University and North- western University. A unique occasion was the Bohnenmahl which followed soon after the extended exercises just described. The Bohnenmahl had its origin on April 22, i804, when a number of Kant's former table companions met in Kant's house for a meal commemorating the friend whom they had so lately lost. This became an annual custom. In i8I2, a somewhat lighter and more whimsical vein was introduced, thus to bring the occasion into closer corres- pondence with the meals enjoyed in company with Kant. Hence- forth the one who chanced to get the piece of cake in which a bean was buried was declared the Bohnenkdnig for the coming year and, with two ministers of his selection, was given all</page><page sequence="16">448 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIII. responsibility in connection with the commemorative Bohnenmahl to be held on the next anniversary of Kant's birth. Through the election of new members from time to time the group was perpetuated and gradually enlarged until, under the name of the "Society of the Friends of Kant," it now includes about one hundred members. This year the Bohnenmahl was a bit hurried, for the Society, together with its numerous guests-most, if not all, of those who came to K6nigsberg from a distance-were invited to a special presentation of Beethoven's " Fidelio " in the municipal theatre. On the last day of the celebration, opportunity was provided to visit numerous places of interest in K6nigsberg under expert guidance. In the evening, the students held a Kommers. How typical of the people-or was it due to the influence of the four preceding days or of the numerous philosophers and invited notables who sat at a table at one end of the large room?-that even on this generally free and easy, hilarious occasion, a long and thoughtful paper on Kant was read by Professor Heinz Heimsoeth of the local university! By following the course of the celebration we have sought to convey a fairly concrete impression of its character, as well as to suggest the thoroughness with which it was organized and the extensive and cordial hospitality enjoyed by its guests. Its objectives were not exclusively philosophical. It was hoped- so it would seem-that through it would come, in part, a renewal of spirit and an increase of moral courage and determination; in part, also, the strength and confidence arising from an earnest commemoration of one who has so wrought that all nations are glad to join in doing him honor. There sometimes seemed in it a challenge-unconscious and undesigned though it may have been-that calumny should cease and the folk of Kant be freely and fully recognized and accepted as co-workers in the upbuilding of human culture or that Kant as well be disowned. Again, the celebration was not without a bearing upon the determination that East Prussia-that " German island in a sea of slavdom " as it is sometimes called-shall continue as an outpost of Western civilization and remain deeply loyal in spirit and in political adhesion to the land from which it was geographically sundered</page><page sequence="17">No. 5.1 THE KANTFEIER IN KONIGSBERG. 449 by the treaty of Versailles. Not infrequently, in the numerous addresses at the Kommers as elsewhere, complaints of harsh injustices to Germany were voiced, as also earnest pleas to the student body and the larger public that, in a spirit of resoluteness and of the categorical imperative, they dedicate themselves to the cause of their deeply stricken and suffering fatherland. Under the circumstances, it was but natural that the appeal here also was to Kant; historical accuracy would rather have de- manded that it be to Fichte. Indeed one was not infrequently reminded forcibly of the Reden an die deutsche Nation. In the more popular addresses, Kant was set forth primarily as an apostle of freedom and self-determination, teaching the gospel of duty and of the categorical imperative. The more strictly philosophical papers by no means failed to give the same elements of Kant's philosophy large emphasis. Connected therewith was a tendency to stress the ultimate implications of moral experience as interpreted by Kant, and in general to single out that which possesses metaphysical significance. In general, one noted a cordial appreciation, in one direction or another, of Kant's antithesis of genesis and validity, and of his attack upon skepti- cism,, relativism and historicism no less than upon dogmatism. But, of course, by no means all the German philosophers of prominence were present, nor was there opportunity, outside of private interchanges of opinion, for discussion. EDWARD L. SCHAUB.
