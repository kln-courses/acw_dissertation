<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS "anthropomorphic theophanies" of the OT, especially those of Genesis 18, Exodus 3, Judges 6 and 13, 1 Samuel 3, Tobit 5 and 12 and the Testament of Abraham. They are of service to the resurrection-appearance tradition, since there is need to give anthropomorphic expression to the appearances of the Risen Lord (p. 271). Written as a thesis under the late L. Goppelt, Alsup has performed a useful service in pointing up the range of different characteristics of the resurrection traditions. The bibliography and the detailed discussions carried on in the footnotes and excursuses are well worth reading and often serve to sharpen literary and exegetical issues. The basic thesis is, however, arbitrary and ambivalent. It is arbitrary in that excluded from serious consideration is a large segment of both NT and history-of-religions evidence: the eschatological vision-tradition that seems to have been central for Paul (even apart from the conversion stories in Acts). The evidence here supports Fuller and Seidensticker against Alsup. The direct verbal links between Mark 16:8 and the LXX version of the vision in Daniel 10, as well as the detailed parallels between that vision and Mark 9:2-8 do, in fact, represent the "substantial parallel" in intention and an "analogy on internal ground" which Alsup claims is lacking between the appearance material in the gospels and the intertestamental literature. The ambivalence is evident in that Alsup begins by excluding the question of historicity but finally lets it in by the back door in his concluding paragraphs (p. 273). The Gattung, the identification and development of which has been the announced goal of the book, turns out to involve "the clear articulation of interest" in stories expressed in a Gattung which bears "witness to God's historical self-disclosure" (p. 273). Since he raises the question about gaining "access to the experience behind the confession," this reviewer is puzzled by Alsup's refusal to allow others to do so and why he has excluded from his investigation other lines of evidence which might have helped toward an answer. Even if the question of historicity were to be excluded consistently, the "heavenly radiance" and kerygmatic traditions cannot be ruled out in advance if one is to get perspective on the range of forms and functions that the resurrection-appearance traditions served in the primitive church. The apocalyptically-linked NT material and the heavenly-vision stories deserve at least as full treatment as the fuzzy, anachronistic theios aner material, which is correctly ruled irrelevant by Alsup (pp. 214-39). Alsup has provided a painstaking history of a narrow segment of tradition, but what is still wanting is a comprehensive analysis of the diversity of forms in which the early church expressed its claim that God had raised Jesus from the dead. Though printed by a German press, the book is remarkably free of typographical errors. One does not know where to place responsibility for "rebuttle" (p. 20), "imminent" for "immanent" (p. 23), Iranaeus (p. 87), Ferrar for Farrer (p. 90 and bibliography), and "verticle" on the Synopsis. But minor blemishes aside, Alsup has written a serious and thoughtful work which leads this reviewer to hope that he will broaden the perspectives of his history-of-tradition study now that he is no longer under obligation to narrow the topic in order to complete a thesis. HOWARD CLARK KEE BRYN MAWR COLLEGE, BRYN MAWR, PA 19010 Pauline Parallels, by Fred O. Francis and J. Paul Sampley. SBLSBS 9. Philadelphia: Fortress; Missoula, MT: Scholars Press, 1975. Pp. ix+388. $10.95. Designed "to facilitate comparative study of various passages in the Pauline corpus" (p. 1), this work prints paragraphs from the epistles in ten parallel columns. Each column represents a Pauline letter, arranged from left to right in canonical order. Ephesians, Colossians, and 2 Thessalonians are included with no prejudgments concerning authorship. The text is that of the 673</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Common Bible (RSV); major variants are listed in the notes. Beneath the primary parallels secondary parallels from Acts and the Pastorals are printed along with OT quotations and allusions. Use of the volume is facilitated by a table of parallels at the beginning and indexes of the primary and secondary parallels at the end. The format has been carefully constructed and the entire project represents arduous labor. The major problem in publishing Pauline parallels is the question of criteria by which the parallel material is selected. For Francis and Sampley they are: "1) similarity of language; 2) similarity of images; or 3) similarity of letter structure or form" (p. 1). As might be expected, the third criterion is clearest and most faithfully followed. The authors fully publish the parallels of letter salutations and the thanksgiving sections. That matters other than formal are involved, however, is seen in the fact that the various salutations are given different titles, and the thanksgiving parallels include passages on similar themes which do not belong to formal thanksgiving material. The second criterion, "similarity of images," is somewhat less successfully applied. Paragraph 155, entitled "Ministers of a new covenant," and following 2 Cor 3:4-6 as the major text, lists no primary parallel in Galatians, though it would seem difficult to omit 3:17. 1 Cor 11:25, where the new covenant image is explicit, is cited only as a secondary parallel. Paragraph 286, with 1 Thess 4:13-18 as the main text, is given the heading, "Those who have fallen asleep and we who are alive." Yet, Rom 13:11, which uses the metaphor of sleep for death, is not listed as either a primary or secondary parallel. The criterion of "similarity of language" appears to be too ambiguous to provide a functional category. As a matter of fact, the breadth and overlapping of criteria tend to create confusion. Paragraph 161 with 2 Cor 4:16-5:5 as the main text is entitled "Momentary affliction is preparing eternal weight of glory," and lists Rom 8:18-25 as a primary parallel. Paragraph 31 where Rom 8:18-25 is the lead passage is headed, "Present sufferings and future glory." Although one would expect these two paragraphs to include the same parallel material, the former lists 1 Cor 15:51-58, while the latter cites no parallel from 1 Corinthians at all. Neither paragraph includes the eschatological material from 1 and 2 Thessalonians. Given the breadth and ambiguity of the criteria, it is difficult to understand how any of the columns can remain empty. Yet, Rom 3:21-26, "Righteousness of God for all who believe," lists not a single parallel, primary or secondary, for Galatians. In spite of omissions of this sort, it becomes increasingly clear that the primary criterion of selectivity is similarity of content or theme. The authors have in the main selected the material well and properly identified the paragraphs in terms of Pauline language. The difficulties which remain are largely the result of problems inherent to the task of constructing Pauline parallels. In view of these problems, Francis and Sampley have fulfilled their aim admirably and presented an impressive product. They properly warn against the danger of its misuses-the temptation to harmonize Pauline texts or to interpret them apart from their historical contexts. When used with care, however, Pauline Parallels can be an effective tool for the investigation of the letters of Paul.
