Baltimore, Md.: John Hopkins University Press, 2001. xiii + 356 pp. ISBN 0-8018-6651-0, $39.95. Michelin's marketing policies, especially from the 1890s to 1940, of fer a fascinating exploration of the interaction between business ob jectives and French cultural identity. The principal marketing inno vation in the 1890s was the construction of a corporate identity by applying anthropomorphic symbolism to advertising. This was a novel approach, similar to that developed in the United States by Pillsbury, whose creation of the "Dough Boy" was the method of pro jecting the company's image to consumers. "Bibendum," known in English as "the Michelin man," was born in 1898. An effigy con structed exclusively from tires varying in size, Bibendum repre sented an instantly recognizable rubberized image. Furthermore, be yond recognition at the purely informative level, the personality projected through Bibendum was also immediately discernible as es sentially French. Reflecting French contemporary society, at least before World War I, Bibendum appeared as an upper middle-class, cigar-smoking, champagne-swigging male chauvinist, conforming to national and gender stereotypes and completely politically incorrect. This was a conscious attempt to exploit national identity to engage corporate and product loyalty. After the war a more fatherly pneu matic figure replaced Bibendum's raffish character, signaling the Michelin brothers' desire to align themselves with the patriotic pro natalism movement in France. Other elements in Michelin's marketing policy assumed increas ing importance. Although early advertising set out to inform the pub lic about the technicalities of automobiles, tire use, and mainte nance, the focus shifted increasingly to the practicalities of motoring and to the pleasures that touring had to offer, part of the campaign to stimulate automobile ownership and use. Tourist guides, initially distributed without charge, showed locations of garages and hotels (excluded from advertising) to assist travelers. The introduction of maps with road numbers began in 1912, when the guides ran to sev eral hundred pages. By also offering cities, towns, and villages instal lation of free signs and milestones showing names and numbers, the company complemented the efforts of the Touring Club of France to promote tourism, a major source of the company's marketing ideas. During World War I Michelin issued detailed guides to the battle fields for tourists. Scenic information was added to garage, hotel, and restaurant locations. Most important in the long term was the intro</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 149 duction of systematic qualitative judgments of the gastronomic expe rience that one could expect at certain hotels and restaurants. This was only one example of the company's imitating and improving upon initiatives of the Tourist Club of France. By the 1930s, the Michelin guides were considered superior to both Baedeker's hotel guide and the Touring Club's annual restaurant guide for those in search of gastronomic excellence, an increasingly important dimen sion to perceptions of French culture. Sales of the Michelin guides exceeded 100,000 between 1926 and 1940. Enlisting French gastronomy to sell tires presented fewer difficul ties than the company's efforts to persuade the nation that embracing mass production and Taylorism was in the national interest. The common association of these processes in France with an impending infection of Americanization risked alienation. Michelin sought to counter that suspicion by insisting that modernization should be achieved within paternalist business regimes of precisely the kind the company practiced, even to the extent of offering employees fam ily allowances. These tactics were consistent with the Michelin brothers' substantial financial support for the pronatalist policy ad vocated by the Alliance Nationale pour l'Accroisement de la Popu lation Fran√ßaise, whose campaign to reverse population decline tapped patriotic impulses. The marketing policies of Michelin, therefore, essentially con sisted of capturing the French national identity, tastes, and national priorities to promote the company's interests. Just how successful these policies were, however, either in advancing the company's success or in shaping and defining French cultural identity, remains problematic. Stephen Harp observes that Michelin's actions defi nitely reflected cultural developments and to a certain extent helped to shape them. This is an understandable equivocation, but one that limits the possibility of an unambiguous conclusion that Michelin had an important influence on national perceptions. As for the suc cess of Michelin's marketing policy, although the company remained the dominant supplier in the French market, world sales reveal that Michelin's share fell by 50 percent between 1923 and 1929, while the company lost market share to Dunlop even in France. Thus, busi ness historians may be disappointed in the ambiguity of the socio economic connections in this otherwise successful historical socio cultural study.
