I. Hallowell1 by Jerome H. Barkow A. I. HALLOWELL is important to sociobiology for two reasons. First, he tried to turn anthropology in a biosocial direction at a time when our field was still celebrating its victory over the bad biology of social Darwinism by discarding all consideration of the evolution of human behavior. Second, he posed many of the problems to which sociobiology must address itself if it is to be worthy of its "new synthesis" sobriquet (Wilson 1975). In this brief paper, I will try to present and develop certain of Hallowell's ideas in such a way as to make obvious their pertinence to sociobiology. At the same time, I will argue that sociobiologists can lessen their risk of biological reductionism by moving in Hallowellian directions. These points will be made in almost summary form, with footnotes indicating where I (and others) have dealt with them at greater length. First, though, was Hallowell really a pioneer sociobiologist?2 HALLOWELL AS A PIONEER SOCIOBIOLOGIST Had anthropologists listened to Hallowell's 1949 presidential address to the American Anthropological Association, they would not have had to wait for biologists to invent a socio- biology. In that address and in his writings, Hallowell urged anthropologists to concern themselves with the evolution of behavior and not just with morphology. He explained to us that we must compare our societies with those of nonhuman primates and argued that before we had culture we must have had a "protoculture" (a term he invented). Our task, he said, was to explain the evolution of language, of symbolic ability, of self-awareness, and of a self which was "culturally consti- tuted." Hallowell discussed how it was that a species arose which lived in a "moral order" and which adhered to and transmitted social norms. In all of these things, Hallowell was indeed a pioneer sociobiologist. Much of Hallowell's message was, belatedly, heard. The late '50s saw the publication of two landmark collections in be- havioral evolution: Roe and Simpson's (1958) Behavior and Evolution and Spuhler's (1959a) The Evolution of Man's Capacity for Culture. The second volume of Tax's Evolution after Darwin (1960) contained several chapters devoted to behavioral evolu- tion, while Washburn's (1961) collection, Social Life of Early Man, was largely devoted to the same topic. Waddington, though not an anthropologist, addressed himself in 1960 to the question of the origin of social norms in The Ethical Animal. Today the subject of the evolution of human social behavior is regularly, if inadequately, considered in most introductory physical anthropology textbooks and discussed at some length in Wilson's (1975) Sociobiology. JEROME H. BARKOW is Associate Professor of Anthropology at Dalhousie University, Halifax, N.S., Canada. He is currently (1977-78) on sabbatical leave and is attached to McGill Univer- sity's Anthropology of Development research center (3434 McTavish St., Montreal, Que., Canada H3A 1X9). Born in 1944, he was educated at Brooklyn College, CUNY (B.A., 1964) and at the University of Chicago (M.A., 1967; Ph.D., 1970). He has conducted extensive fieldwork among the Hausa of Nigeria and Niger and has recently begun work among the Migili (Koro) of Nigeria's Middle Belt. His biosocial papers include "Darwinian Psychological Anthropology: A Biosocial Approach" (CA 14:373- 88), "Prestige and Culture: A Biosocial Interpretation" (CA 16: 553-72), "Attention Structure and Internal Representations," in The Social Structure of Attention, edited by Michael R. Chance and Raymond R. Larsen (London: Wiley, 1976), and "Culture and Sociobiology" (American Anthropologist, in press). He is currently preparing a major study of the evolution of human social psychological characteristics. The present paper, submitted in final form 25 vii 77, was sent for comment to 50 scholars. The responses are printed below and are followed by a reply by the author. I This paper was originally prepared for presentation (under the somewhat misleading title of "A. I. Hallowell and the Evolution of Consciousness") at the November 1976 (75th) annual meetings of the American Anthropological Association. The term "sociobiology," used in the title, was intended to refer to the broad body of literature dealing with the evolution of behavior, human behavior in particular Since then, "sociobiology" has come to connote the particular theories associated with R. D. Alexander, W. D. Hamilton, R. L. Trivers, and E. 0. Wilson. The term seemed less restrictive in meaning when, during the 1975 AAA meetings, an informal get-together of those anticipating organizing biosocial-biocultural-human-ethological-so- ciobiological sessiohis (or submitting papers on these topics) for the following year's meetings led to a consensus to use the term "sociobiology" in the titles of our various sessions as a signal to the program committee to avoid scheduling our efforts in competing time-slots. 2 I wish to thank Ray Fogelson of the University of Chicago for bibliographic help in uncovering that part of Hallowell's work which deals with behavioral evolution. Each of Hallowell's articles and chapters on this subject overlaps with the others in such a way that one must cite either all or none. I have therefore largely omitted specific references to his work (Hallowell 1955-76). The clearest statement of Hallowell's thought on the nature of the self is probably his 1959 "Behavioral Evolution and the Emergence of the Self." The most complete statement of his general thinking about behavioral evolution is to be found in his 1963 "Personality, Culture, and Society in Behavioral Evolution" (reprinted in the posthumous 1976 collection Contributions to Anthropology). The 1955 Culture and Experience includes his important, hortatory, AAA Presidential address. Vol. 19 * No. 1 llarch 1978</page><page sequence="2">If Hallowell is a historic figure in sociobiology, however, I suspect that it is because many of us have arrived independently where he once trod. Despite the fact that his work is crucial for an understanding of the evolution of human behavioral diver- sity, it has been neglected by sociobiologists. One reason for this is that Hallowell deliberately (1961) limited himself to delineating what happened in human behavioral evolution, rather than why (just as well, given the state of evolutionary biology at the pre-Trivers, pre-Hamilton time he wrote). But perhaps the major reason for the neglect of Hallowell is that sociobiology has paid little attention to explaining the be- havioral diversity to which his work is germane, instead con- centrating on regularities of social behavior, on the underlying "biogram" or "biogrammar" (Count 1973, Tiger 1969, Tiger and Fox 1972, Tiger and Shepher 1975), or else on invariant aspects of behavior, e.g., facial expression (Ekman 1973, Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1975). Mainstream social science has long argued for the infinite diversity and plasticity of human social behavior, so that some areas of sociobiology have sought a place in the sun by demonstrating that there are limits to diversity. This undertaking has been valuable, but it has also led us to slight that diversitv itself. Sociobiology must account for the diversity and malleability of human social behavior, rather than content itself with pointing out its limits and central tendencies. It is Hallowell who teaches us how to deal with this diversity from an evolutionary perspective. For Hallowell, culture implies a moral order-a system of normative prescriptions, of shoulds and oughts. Human be- havior can vary so enormously because it is always controlled by the local normative system rather than by a tight genetic program. (Presumably, the local norms vary in response to local ecological pressures, but such questions are part of the field of culture and ecology and are not the subject of this paper.) A normative system implies self-awareness, because it is the self which is constantly monitoring the organism in order to evaluate its conformity to local norms. Such self-monitoring (and monitoring of "others") implies the internalization of the norms. Because local norms can vary, so can social behavior and therefore social structure, permitting our species to occupy a number of quite different ecological settings and implying that each culture provides a different sense of self for the individual. The self and the manner in which it evaluates itself are, in Hallowell's terms, "culturally constituted." This bare summary hardly does the topic justice, and I will return to it shortly. First, however, some may feel that the concepts of "self" and "normative structure" are hypothetical mechanisms not properly the province of sociobiology. After all, Alexander (1975) has recently criticized ethology for getting bogged down in questions of mechanism and losing sight of evolution. Emlen (1976) points out that the great strength of sociobiology lies in its ability to make interpretations and predictions of social structure from a limited number of variables, usually of an ecological nature. Why, then, should the sociobiologist concern himself with such "soft" mechanisms as "self"? The answer is that Hallowell's "soft" concepts are to the explanation of the evolution of human behavioral diversity as Hockett and Ascher's (1964) "design characteristics" are to the explanation of the evolution of human language. We may quarrel with Hockett and Ascher's ideas as to how we developed language, but not with their presentation of what is to be explained (e.g., displacement, duality of pattern, and so on). In the same way, Hallowell presents sociobiology with the challenge of explaining the evolution of a sense of self, because self-awareness is as basic to human behavioral diversity as displacement is to human language. Other social genera achieve wide dispersion by speciating and subspeciating, so that each local group develops a social structure appropriate to its environment. In contrast, cultural and protocultural species succeed in developing behavioral adaptations to local conditions without substantial genetic change. The mechanisms permitting this flexibility are that of the self and the normative system. COGNITIVE MAPPING AND THE SELF What would be the phylogenetic origin of self-awareness?3 One approach to this question begins with Hallowell's (1955) suggestion that the world in which the individual lives is culturally constituted, defined and categorized for him by his culture and his particular experiences-it is his "behavioral environment." One may call this behavioral environment a "cognitive map" (Tolman 1932), a "mazeway" (Wallace 1970), or even an " Umwelt" (von Uexkull 1957). These concepts reflect the fact that we are never in contact with physical reality but only with the reports of our senses. From the messages brought to the central nervous system by their afferent neurons, organisms develop internal representations of external reality. I am in no way qualified to discuss the neuro- physiological basis of these cognitive maps, but it is important to recognize their behavioral reality. The internal representations of, for example, a frog seem to consist of little but movement. A still insect is unlikelv to be perceived, but one skimming by elicits an -instant, familiar response. For the frog, the most salient aspects of reality are those which involve motion, presumably because in the frog's normal environment food is always in motion. Thus, the frog's cognitive map would consist largely of objects in motion (as well as representations pertaining to reproduction and safety from predators). Compared to the frog's, the cognitive maps of human beings are incredibly complex. It is as if our central nervous system incorporated the most complete computer-simulation model of reality imaginable, with representations of virtually all detect- able physical and social objects and of the processes which relate them to one another. One of the most striking characteris- tics of these maps is that the central nervous system can employ them in the absence of their physical referents. This capacity is, of course, what Hockett and Ascher (1964) refer to as "displacement." We can think about, as well as talk about, what is not there. We can do this, presumably, because of our cognitive maps. For the frog, that which is in motion is adaptively signifi- cant; given natural selection, the central nervous system of the frog is therefore designed to detect and record motion. For primates, a very wide range of phenomena has adaptive signifi- cance, but the social is paramount. The terrestrial monkey or ape is usually dependent for protection on his fellow troop members. The dependence of these ground-dwelling primates on each other for survival implies that they have great adaptive significance for each other and, hence, that their central nervous systems will be designed to map elaborate and long-lasting internal representations of fellow troop members, with parti- cular reference perhaps to the larger and more dominant individuals. In the course of our own evolution, we apparently became terrestrial as a result of the dryingtrend of the Pliocene. As we became terrestrial, I suggest, our internal representations of each other became more elaborate. The individuals whose physical presence had the greatest implications for our survival were first mother and other caretakers and second the dominant males. Thus, during our evolution we were selected for the tendency to internalize our fellow troop members, with special reference to mother and the dominant males. If the parental and dominant individuals were well-repre- I I have dealt with some of this material previously (Barkow 1976a, 1977). 100 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">Barkow: SOCIAL NORMS, THE SELF, AND SOCIOBIOLOGY sented in our cognitive maps, so too was another individual whose existence and present state was of crucial importance to us-the self. What do we call an information-processing system which simulates external reality and constantly monitors that reality in order to maintain maximum congruence between its internal representations and the external, and simultaneously monitors its own state and its relationship to the external in order to maintain the accuracy of an internal representation of itself? Do we not describe such a system as self-aware? As self- conscious? I am here suggesting that when we phenomeno- logically experience self-awareness, the central nervous system is evaluating the state of the self and its relationship to external reality. I suspect that many other species also are self-con- scious-the chimpanzee certainly is-but I will limit my discussion to our own (cf. Gallup 1975, Griffin 1976). Human beings have a central nervous system which incorporates an internal representation of the organism itself that is con- tinuously modified by the ongoing activities of that organism. This, I suggest, is the origin of Hallowell's "self."4 THE SELF AND NORMATIVE STRUCTURES Hallowell explains that the self evaluates itself in terms of local norms, which it internalizes. Thus, human behavior can vary greatly from one group to another. Hallowell does not explain, however, how our ancestors were selected for this ability to internalize and adhere to social norms. It would seem reasonable to suppose that the internalization of norms originated in the capacity to internalize other group members. Since I have elsewhere dealt with this supposition at greater length (1976a and especially 1977), I will here present only a brief summary before going on to discuss earlier sociobiological theories of the evolution of con;formity to norms. Initially, subordinate individuals would learn to behave in certain ways when in the presence of a particular troop member. In effect, the presence of this troop member would enforce adherence to a sort of implicit norm or "protonorm." As part of the general selection for more elaborate cognitive maps of the environment, the internal representation of a particular troop member would become so differentiated and long-lasting as occasionally to enforce the behavior associated with its proto- type even in the latter's absence. Thus, attending to this internalized representation or image would result in proto- normative behavior, a tendency which would be selected for to the extent that it enhanced the internalizer's fitness. Since the original internalized individuals are likely to have been parental and dominant figures, the behaviors associated with them probably tended to be adaptive: obeying mother in mother's absence tends to improve one's chances of survival. Increasing symbolic ability would ultimately have transformed such protonorms into genuine, symbolic norms not consciously associated with any particular significant other. This extended conjecture has the merit of being consistent not only with Hallowell's thought, but with the theories of norm acquisition developed by both Sigmund Freud and G. H. Mead (Barkow 1976a). This argument differs sharply from the two competing sociobiological theories of the evolution of norm acquisition. The sociobiologists are not primarily concerned with explaining norms per se; they deal with altruism. Their theories are relevant here because conformity to norms frequently benefits others at one's own expense (e.g., doing one's share of the labor in a workbee, returning a borrowed tool, etc.). For the biologist, however, "altruism" is a technical term. For example, Trivers (1971:35) stipulates that altruism is "behavior that benefits another organism, not closely related, while being apparently detrimental to the organism performing the behavior, benefit and detriment being defined in terms of contribution to inclusive fitness." In other words, if I risk my life to save you from drowning and you are no relative of mine, I have acted altruistically. Trivers argues that the tendency to take such risks evolves in a species if the benefited individual is likely to reciprocate the altruistic act. That likelihood depends on the meeting of certain preconditions, e.g., long period of association between the two individuals concerned, "benefit of the altruistic act to the recipient . . . greater than the cost of the act to the performer" (p. 36), selection against "cheaters" (those who fail to reciprocate), etc. For Trivers, reciprocal altruism is a kind of symbiosis and can evolve both within and between species. He goes on to point out that our Pleistocene hunter-gatherer ancestors met the preconditions for selection for reciprocal altruism, while language may have made possible the formulation of "rules of conduct, cheating being detected as infractions of such a rule" (p. 52). These rules would have been "norms of reciprocal conduct." Since being a habitual cheater involves risking the loss of the benefits of the altruistic attentions of others, guilt may have been selected for as a guarantor of reciprocity on the part of would-be cheaters.5 Trivers suggests that a number of the findings of experimental social psychology are consistent with his theory, but we will not follow him into these sidelines. It is sufficient to note that the theory provides at least a partial explanation for the evolution of the human tendency to conform to norms. Trivers's definition of altruism specifies that unselfish be- havior between kin is not altruism. This apparently arbitrary distinction results from his efforts to distinguish between reciprocal altruism and Hamilton's (1964, 1971) concept of kin selection. Kin selection is based on Haldane's (1932) and Hamilton's idea that individuals strive to maximize their inclusive fitness, defined as their genetic representation in the next generation. For example, parental behavior can evolve because the parent shares at least 50% of the genes of each of its offspring. If an organism has, for example, four offspring, selection may favor the parent's risking the 100% of the genes it carries in its body in order to protect the 200% of its genes represented by the offspring. I oversimplify a complex argu- ment, but it is clear that behaviors among kin which we human beings would consider morally altruistic can readily evolve biologically, under certain conditions. Since our hunter-gatherer ancestors met these conditions, we should not be surprised to find that our species exhibits a great deal of unselfish behavior among kinsmen. To the extent that conformity to norms is unselfish and favors one's kin over oneself, Hamilton's concept of kin selection explains the evolution of human adherence to norms. Thus we have three explanations for the evolution of human normative behavior: reciprocal altruism, kin selection, and the internalization of significant others. The three are quite com- patible with one another and, unfortunately from the logic-of- science point of view, may all be true, leading to a sort of over- determined explanation of the evolution of human conformity to norms. Trivers himself (1971:46) discusses the probable interaction between kin selection and reciprocal altruism, suggesting that while we expect reciprocity from kin, we are rather more forgiving of its lack than when non-kin are involved. Similarly, selection for attention to internalized others would have interacted with both kin selection and selection for recinrocal altruism in that early Drotonorms enforced by the 4Since this paper was written, I have become aware of Shaf ton's (1976:63-73) treatment of self and self-image in chimpanzees and hominids. Shaf ton's ideas appear to be broadly compatible with those presented here, perhaps the major difference being his emphasis on social rank as a determinant of self-image. 5 Cf. my argument (1976a) that guilt involves fear of the retribution of an (internalized) parental or "alpha" figure-phylogenetically, at least. Vol. 19 - No. 1 * March 1978 101</page><page sequence="4">internalized figure would likely have involved unselfish be- havior towards close kin and, just possibly, purely reciprocal unselfishness towards others. All three types of selection would have converged in the complex cluster of behaviors now labelled by the social scientist as "conformity to norms." But what of violation of norms, what of cheating? If norm- following behavior is a human universal, so is norm-flouting; any theory of the phylogenesis of conformity to norms must also explain nonconformity. In this respect, Hallowell was too much a product of his times for his theories to be complete. The modern sociobiologists, Alexander (1975) and particularly Trivers (1971), provide help. Alexander suggests that norm violation is so universal and inevitable as to justify the dramatic statement that society is built on "lies." This perpetual hypocrisy is the result of a conflict between the increase in inclusive fitness which derives from social life-a social life which requires adherence to norms-and the increase in fitness which stems from violating norms at the expense of others. The most obvious example of this conflict is male adultery: the individual in effect must balance the possibility of an increase in reproductive success by committing adultery against the loss of fitness which may result from being discovered. Trivers (1971) argues that there has been selection in favor of behavioral attributes which reduce the probability of success- ful cheating. One of these is what he terms "moral aggression": we feel a sense of righteous anger at the violator of norms, an anger which can generate phenomena ranging from individual murder to feuds among kin groups to harsh and punitive laws. Moral aggression, however, only exacerbates the conflict between the advantages of enforcing the norms for others and personally flouting them. The obvious resolution, conscious hypocrisy, seems less common than the use of distortions of information concerning the self (or "defense mechanisms" [Barkow 1975a]). Rationalization is the usual distortion em- ployed, and it permits us to uphold and violate the norms simultaneously. Of course, too much rationalizing of violations may lead to the weakening of the entire normative structure and a possible loss of fitness for all concerned, a circumstance hardly unusual in human history. HALLOWELL'S VIEWS AS A CORRECTIVE FOR RE- DUCTIONISM Why do we need Hallowell and ideas of normative behavior based on self-awareness and evaluation? The reason is that the theories of Hamilton and Trivers alone run the risk of biological reductionism.6 The theory of altruism provides a clear example of this risk, one particularly germane in view of our earlier discussion and of the growing literature dealing with the topic (see, e.g., Campbell 1972, 1975; Dawkins 1976; Hamilton 1964, 1970, 1971, 1975; Trivers 1971, 1974; Wilson 1975). In ordinary language, "altruism" refers to behaving in a manner which furthers the interests of another, without regard for one's own interests. The word connotes laudatory con- formity to a moral code. Sociobiologists, as we have seen, use the term in a more limited sense, one involving the maximiza- tion of inclusive fitness. The layman's altruism can be termed "moral altruism" and that of the sociobiologist "biological altruism." The two kinds of altruism may or may not overlap: If I save a stranger from drowning and he later rescues me, this is biological (in this case, reciprocal) altruism. If it is unlikely that he will ever reciprocate my act of bravery and he is no kin of mine, I have not committed biological altruism; what- ever the degree of consanguinity he and I share, and regardless of the probability of his rescuing me at some time in the future, the act is moral altruism. Reductionism begins when one confuses these two types of altruism. Biological altruism is ultimately an empirical matter: a given act either does or does not tend to increase one's in- clusive fitness. Selection for biological altruism probably generated the capacity for moral altruism in our species, just as it generated parental behavior in songbirds and symbiotic behavior among various species of fish. Human behavior, however, takes place in terrns of moral codes, normative orders which are culturally constituted. If we seek to reduce an individual's behavior to biological altruism, then we have slipped into the kind of reductionism for which Hallowell's work is a corrective, the kind of reductionism that Sahlins (1976) wrongly insists is necessarily a part of sociobiology. During our phylogenesis, acceptance of moral codes pre- sumably (in the usual circularity of evolutionary reasoning) increased inclusive fitness, but the extent to which our moral codes today still increase fitness is very much an empirical question. Human social norms are products not of biological, but of sociocultural, evolution, an evolution constrained by the biology of our species but not reducible to it. It may be that there is a genetic predisposition to learn more easily than others those forms of moral behavior most directly related to inclusive fitness; this is another empirical question. One could even speculate that the invarient sequence of moral develop- ment studied by Kohlberg and Turiel (1971) represents a genetic program. To go directly from "altruism" in birds and mammals to "altruism" in human beings, however, is genuine biological reductionism. It is also bad biology, since it involves ignoring an important capacity of our species: the capacity to behave morally. Hallowell's work guards us from this error. Under what conditions will a species develop a protoculture and a rudimentary sense of self, rather than simply be selected for the specific behaviors currently adaptive? Neither Hallowell nor sociobiology seems to have dealt with this question. The answer may lie in a heterogeneous environment lasting many generations in which individuals are exposed to altering settings, perhaps recurrent ones, during the course of a lifetime. Long- term social-ecological stability would lead, not to selection for behavioral flexibility, but to the genetic assimilation of cultur- ally acquired characteristics (Wilson 1971, 1975; Barkow n.d.a). That is, individuals who absorbed norms with greater efficiency than others would presumably have an advantage in fitness. Gradually, there would be selection for the ability to acquire with great efficiency the particular norms, at the expense of some of the capacity for change. Crook (1972) suggests that this process occurs among nonhuman primate groups; pre- sumably, it would have taken place among our own ancestors unless the environment altered sufficiently often to force a change in social structure. Bigelow's (1973) argument that man evolved as a self-predator, with constant warfare among local groups, is consistent with this suggestion that we moved from protoculture to culture in part as the result of the great selective advantage of being capable of rapid changes in social behavior: war, after all, brings change. CONCLUSIONS Sociobiology must somehow balance the application of general biological and evolutionary principles to our species with a recognition that we are indeed a unique animal. Hallowell's work helps us to maintain this balance by permitting the evolutionary explanation of traits which do indeed separate us from most, though perhaps not all, other social animals. The ideas of self and social norm are a challenge to sociobiology. To ignore that challenge is to fall into the reductionism of which sociobiology is so often accused. 6 For fuller discussion of sociobiology, cultural evolution, an reductionism, see Barkow (1978). 102 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">Barkow: SOCIAL NORMS, THE SELF, AND SOCIOBIOLOGY Much of this paper has consisted largely of conjecture and educated guess in the absence of empirical knowledge. We need long-term studies of protocultural behavior (cf. Menzel 1972) in a variety of species. We require knowledge of the relationship between genetic assimilation and protoculturally acquired be- havioral flexibility. Some research already exists on the self- concept of nonhuman primates (e.g., Gallup 1975), but far more is needed. We need to see if the concept of "protonorm" is meaningful in the context of the behavior of other social species. We need a far more thorough theoretical treatment than is here provided of the implications for sociobiology of a sense of self and of normative structure. We need far more building on the ideas of A. I. Hallowell. Comments by KENNETH L. BEALS Department of Anthropology, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Ore. 97331, U.S.A. 5 ix 77 There is a revival of interest in the relationship between man's biology and culture. Barkow has demonstrated the importance of Hallowell in regard to the historical development of the field. I doubt, however, that Hallowell would himself have claimed to be a sociobiologist, since the term has come to be identified with the particular theories of particular socio- biologists. Typically, such theories explain behavioral patterns in terms of reproductive fitness. Many social scientists (whether justified or not) see such ideas as biological determinism. Barkow himself notes the increasing restrictiveness of "socio- biology" in a footnote. If labels for distinguished figures are useful, Hallowell is better regarded as a pioneer in cultural biology. The distinction is suggested by the more culturally oriented perspective of his works and the frequent attribution to sociobiologists of reduc- tionism. If one refers to that part of anthropology which seeks to understand how human social life and biological heritage interact, then bioculturalism is a preferable term. Barkow makes a point about protocultural and cultural species' adapting to local conditions without substantial genetic change. The fundamental idea is that culture reduces the conse- quence of natural selection. It may, or it may not. Human populations adapt both biologically and socially to different ecological circumstances. Cultural innovations (by creating new environmen"ts for occupation) can in fact lead to new biological adaptations which would otherwise not have oc- curred. The bulk of the work of physical anthropology consists of documenting a great variety of substantial genetic changes among human populations under all sorts of cultural conditions through both time and space. A major problem in applying evolutionary theory to the concept of the self lies in the difficulty of measuring the varia- tion. On the one hand, all human beings (with the exception of the comatose and possibly some kinds of psychotics) are aware of themselves. Moreover, all of us are presumably aware of ourselves to the same degree. Explaining variation where none exists is obviously impossible. Surely, however, social experience does affect the way we individually perceive ourselves. Granted that this is so, it is difficult to explain the variability unless we first understand how specific cultural, ecological, and biological differences are specifically related to differences in self -conscious- ness. Moreover, what does "self-consciousness" operationally mean in evolutionary theory? Even plants change their be- havior in response to external stimuli. There is the problem of explicitly defining the concept of self so that its presence or absence and magnitude can be determined from acts of behavior among different organisms. As Barkow states, much of his contribution is conjecture in the absence of empirical knowledge. I share with him the hope that such conjecture may lead to a broader perspective for both sociobiologists and their critics. by MARTIN DALY Department of Psychology, University of California, Riverside, Calif. 92521, U.S.A. 17 ix 77 Granting Hallowell's merits as a thoughtful, articulate advocate of evolutionism, I remain unconvinced by Barkow's assertions that "he posed many of the problems to which sociobiology must address itself" and that "his work is crucial for an under- standing of the evolution of human behavioral diversity." Hallowell posed important questions about which events in hominid evolution preceded and were preconditions for which, but this issue is not especially sociobiological. A satisfactory reconstruction of our evolutionary history will depend mainly upon contributions from paleontology, archeology, comparative primatology, and cultural anthropology. Sociobiology's primary contribution to the subject is to remind us that natural selection is differential reproduction-hardly a novel point, but one inadequately stressed in former decades. If we wish to under- stand the evolution of big brains, for example, we must under- stand how they bestow reproductive advantage, which may or may not depend merely upon differential survival capacity (Fox 1972). Hallowell, who shared with many anthropologists a mis- guided preoccupation with the quest for the crucial "criterion of human status," proposed that "ego" launches man and culture. Barkow offers complex "cognitive maps" and "the tendency to internalize our fellow troop members." Such psychologizing does not seem very helpful. Neither author offers insight into the special circumstances of hominid evolu- tion. Why aren't terrestrial Carnivora as clever and cultural as we? Nevertheless, Hallowell's insistence that the psychological characterization of human nature is an essential component of any complete science of man deserves consideration from sociobiologists. The weak link in current sociobiological theory does indeed appear to be psychological. How, mechanistically, are organisms constructed to attain the abstract goal of maxi- mizing inclusive fitness? If, for example, natural selection has inclined human males to invest in wives' children in rough proportion to the culture-specific degree of paternity confidence (Kurland 1978), what is the nature of the evolved mechanisms that subserve this adaptive strategy? Furthermore, since every situation is unique, natural selection can only have equipped organisms to respond to abstractly categorized classes of situa- tions that have recurred often enough to have selective signifi- cance. Therefore, organisms cannot always choose the best course of action for their genes' posterity, but only a course that works out on average. Just how finely categorized are choice situations, and how? Do organisms routinely integrate multiple information sources to optimize behavior, and, if so, how do these decision processes work? These mechanisms demand elucidation, but I doubt that psychological constructs of the sort favored by Hallowell and Barkow are what is needed. The mechanisms subserving sociobiology's airy "strategies" require investigation in mice as well as men, and promising studies are in fact under way, investigating just how good animals are at weighing multiple factors and optimizing behavioral decisions. What, after all, can we do with Hallowell's (or Barkow's) "self"? It is now fashionable to malign the behavioristic revolu- tion in psychology for losing sight of important issues, but that revolution occurred for a reason. Behaviorists got on with the Vol. 19 * No. 1 * March 1978 103</page><page sequence="6">business of feasible empirical research. Barkow is surely correct in suggesting that self-awareness is an important, unsolved evolutionary problem, but I predict that any sociobiologist who attacks it seriously will be allocating his intellectual resources suboptimally. by WHITNEY DAVIS Claverly 15, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. 02138, U.S.A. 20 ix 77 I was impressed with Barkow's lucid exposition of Hallowell and his extension of Hallowell's work on behavioural evolution. I have two comments, and I mean them generally rather than in specific relation to a specific point made by Barkow. First of all, he attempts a synthesis of sociobiological and anthropo- logical material and shows that there does not necessarily have to be an antithesis between them. Perhaps, however, he could have stressed more strongly the differences in logical intents and modes of discourse. Secondly, although my research interest is archaeological rather than psychological, I believe that the emergence of "self-awareness" is one of the central facts, and problems, of hominid and human evolution-and I would therefore like to add somewhat to Barkow's paper by considering at what points the historical record documents that emergence. Sociobiology finds its subject matter in the study of organis- mic adaptive responses to selective pressures, responses which sociobiologists define as the morphology and behaviours maximizing individual and inclusive fitness. Sociobiologists generally suppose not only that these behaviours are "natural" or "innate," but further that the organism is genetically programmed to utilize them; this view is popularized in the work of Dawkins (1976; see also Barash 1977). From this view it is a short leap, but over a vast chasm, to the claim that genes are designed to perpetuate and even aggrandize them- selves. But if a sociobiologist claims a genetic coding for a specific human behaviour, he opens himself to attack from anthropologists and sociologists, who see more to cultural activity than the action of a self-perpetuating gene system. Barkow would evidently regard a biology which explains individual human behaviour solely in terms of inclusive fitness as dangerously reductionist, and Hallowell's ideas are of course a "corrective" to reductionism. Perhaps, however, we miss the real issue at hand in fearing reductionism, for we have not yet specified the central concerns and the limits of the sciences in question. Evolution, although fundamentally and simply continuous change in gene frequency, works upon the biological equipment of the organism responding to selective pressures, and thus, for instance, even Barkow's "phylogenetic origin of self-awareness" rests upon the senses' reports of the environment (resources, mates, predators, pathogens, weather, hazards) and the spinomedullary and paleo- and neencephalic control of the biological response. The relationship between genes and this biological equipment is not in doubt; on the basis of gene control in biosynthesis, we are compelled to ask ourselves further how much gene control is exerted over "behaviour." Behavioural genetics has over the years built up a corpus of experiments which purport to establish the existence of direct genetic control over behaviour (see Caspari 1958; Fuller and Thompson 1960; Parsons 1973:11-30; Wilson 1973). The early single-gene/single-behaviour correlations have received severe scientific criticism (for example, Wilcock 1969, 1971) and are as discredited as single-gene/single-morphology correlations. However, some investigators have recently come close to proving (that is, observing) genetic control over behaviourally significant physiology (see, for example, Kaplan and Trout 1969; Kaplan 1970; Hatta and Benzer 1970, 1972; Benzer 1973; and studies in psycho- and neuroendocrinology such as Lunde and Hamburg 1972, Rose 1975b, Michael 1968, and compare Rose 1975a). The question, then, is not whether "behaviour" is genetically regulated, but rather what kind and complexity of "behaviour" is genetically regulated, for what adaptive pur- poses, and at what degree of intensity of control. With the critics of "deterministic" sociobiology, we may legitimately claim that there is no direct genetic basis for various human "behaviours" at the level of sociality (Sociobiology Study Group 1976:185); if it is only an extremely indirect and elabo- rate biochemical path from a genetic encoding to "helping my parents" or "fearing authority," what gain is there in attempt- ing an explication of social behaviour solely in terms of natural selection? It would, nevertheless, be blind to ignore the factor of genetic control in the evolution of the "learning rules" (Feldman and Cavalli-Sforza 1976) and morphological con- figurations (Bryan 1963) which underlie behaviour and, at a step farther removed, underlie the diversity of human sociality. And so perhaps the explanation of human social patterns which are "universal" (incest avoidance, nepotism, parental altruism and investment, and perhaps kin classification) should rightly be focussed on the degree to which these patterns maximize individual and inclusive fitness. Whether sociobiology is directly at odds with anthropology in this is not, in my view, and as I think Barkow is implicitly suggesting, a substantive laboratory issue, since, for example, Barkow's three explanations for "normative&gt;-behaviour" are compatible "from a logic-of-science point of view." Much of any apparent conflict seems to me to be due to a philosophical or semantic muddle which revolves around the logical and scientific differences between and limits of biological and anthropological discourse. It is usually meaningless for an anthropologist, working in an anthropological frame of refer- ence, to cite gene control as an explanation for some social pattern or cultural artifact. To do so, he must travel far down an ontogenetic scale to uncover the "root cause" underlying some characteristic of a much higher point on the scale. Some philosophers of science even say that levels of ontogeny are not reducible to each other in this fashion (for example, Polanyi 1968); but even if we avoid the debate over reductionism, at the very least the usefulness of lower-level biological under- standing in explicating problems of a higher level of ontogeny must always be limited and qualified (and thus, as Barkow points out, we must add the Hallowellian notion of "internalized others" to an account of normative behaviour based upon kin selection and genetic self-interest; see other examples and remarks by Grobstein 1962, Rosen 1968, Brittan 1970). Our task is to work out the frontiers of the sciences involved, and in so doing I believe we will find no antithesis between (socio)- biology and anthropology, and no primacy of one discipline over the other, but only an interdisciplinary mosaic. Barkow's paper, I think, shows that- inferences from the two fields in combination explain far more than either field explains in- dividually.1 As Hallowell insisted, and as Barkow rightly reiterates, the problems which confront us are as much historical and empirical as theoretical. Sociobiologists claiming a link between genes and behaviour, so that behaviour can be legitimately and success- fully interpreted in terms of natural selection, must produce laboratory evidence of such a link. Anthropologists and his- torians who insist upon the importance of nongenetic and "culturally constituted" variables in human behavioural evolu- tion must reveal why and at what points human behaviour 1 Thus Barkow draws from both evolutionary biology and "Hal- lowellian anthropology" to explicate the development of "proto- culture and a rudimentary sense of self." I believe that biologists too are coming to see the complementarity of sociobiology and an- thropology; one hopes that biology will reconsider any claim to absorb the whole of anthropology and the humanities in its "new synthesis" and that anthropology will renounce any claim to be a sole overarching "science of man." 104 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">Barkow: SOCIAL NORMS, THE SELF, AND SOCIOBIOLOGY ceased to be "instinctive," "innate," or "programmed" (and therefore, to a biologist, plausibly genetic) and became "con- scious" or "self-aware." Barkow's model for the phylogenetic origin of self-awareness is as good a theory as we might con- struct, but it remains for the historian to provide evidence for it. Unfortunately, providing material evidence for the emer- gence of consciousness in human biobehavioural and cultural evolution is as difficult as providing material evidence for genetic control over complex social behaviour. Perhaps the origin of self-awareness is coincident with the development of culture, which is, of course, generally viewed as a biological adaptation in itself (for example, Spuhler 1959b:1; Dobzhansky 1963). A great deal then depends upon our central definition: what is "culture," and when and how did it appear? Hominid paleontologists and archaeologists are generally forced to accept as a working definition of culture something to the effect that culture is the body of technical devices and osteodontokeratic activities of a hominid or human population. But in Barkow's model for the origin of self-awareness, does "culture" not subsume, or is it not coextensive with, a set of social and "internalized" norms? And in the documentation of human consciousness, although there is little doubt that "the possession and use of a certain material or technical item may be linked with the view which a society may have of itself and of the world in which it exists" (Riviere 1969:151), we have very little useful knowledge of the morality, or aesthet- ics, or religious feeling, and so on, of even terminal Paleolithic populations. Our archaeological, documentary, material knowl- edge of such things commences with the critical early millennia of the food-producing era, with some scattered knowledge of Paleolithic art and calendrical observation or numeration. And archaeologists of the urban and food-producing cultures have long known that the codes and norms of these cultures are overlaid on a "tremendous accumulation of preliterate drives and experiences" (Albright 1959:71). The single most significant cultural acquisition of the preliterate must have been the development or acquisition of spoken language. Language is predicated on vocal morphology and upon man's capacity for forming concepts and symbols, associated with cranial and neurological development. But the association between spoken language and "self-awareness," or what archaeologists have in the past more narrowly called "conscience" or "speculative thought," although plausible and probable, is in my view not at all well understood. The problem is great, but answers may be forthcoming. We may be far from the time when we may speak as confidently of the codes and norms of an early population as we speak of the cultural superficialities and old bones of our ancestors. But archaeology has done much to investigate the cognitive abilities and psychological orientation of early historical populations (see, for example, Frankfort et al. 1946; Levy 1948; Giedion 1962; Marshack 1970; Clark 1970:105-46); hominid paleon- tology will specify when the evolving species was physiologically and morphologically capable of the thought and behaviour we normally associate with various degrees and types of con- sciousness, culture, and cognition; history and ethnography provide us with the case histories of human diversity, which document the interaction of biology's genotype and anthro- pology's phenotype-all supplementing the Darwinian model by which we may predict under what general circumstances and in what way organisms will be likely to evolve and practice a certain behaviour. I expect that further historical and experi- mental research will produce the evidence to confirm a model of the biocultural evolution of human psychology along the lines of that proposed by Barkow.1 Although the imDlications of this kind of research are great, scholarship should of course face up not only to its obligation to move cautiously in a sensitive matter, but also to its obligation to advance under- standing no matter what the cost to our various liberal or conservative commonplaces and complacencies. by KERRY D. FELDMAN Department of Anthropology, University of Alaska, Anchorage, 3221 Providence Dr., Anchorage, Alaska 99504, U.S.A. 19 ix 77 To what extent and how are new scientific paradigms accepted as worthwhile areas of investigation by the "scientific com- munity," and to what extent are these "new syntheses" truly "new"? Barkow, like any other proponent of sociobiological explanatory strategies, inevitably faces both of these questions. By suggesting that various sociobiologists who begin from the physical science disciplines have overlooked important seminal work by cultural anthropologists (in this case, Hallowell), Barkow has partially addressed the latter question. Socio- biology is "new" today only for those investigators who have not familiarized themselves with anthropological writing of the mid-20th century. The more difficult challenge lies in addressing the first question: how to get a serious hearing for a somewhat new paradigm from one's peers. Generations, if not centuries, of intellectual traditions have provided epistemological frame- works which have functioned to establish academic reputations, personal world views, and yellowing classroom lecture notes. How are anthropologists who have been exposed so thoroughly to the theoretical views of cultural relativity and of "man the symboling, culture-shaped creature" going to be adequately open to the proposition that perhaps some of human socio- cultural behavior is genetically conditioned or programmed? Wilson claims, I believe, that no more than 15% of human behavior may be involved at most. Ideally, evidence, not encrusted intellectual traditions, will be the prime battleground for the debate. Having just shared with students Evans-Pritchard's (1965) remarks on theories concerning the origin of religion, I am struck by the isomorphism of Barkow's subject area and that of religion-origin theorizing. Evans-Pritchard dismisses the 19th-century "origins" writing as representative of the "if I were a horse" mode of inference: If I were a "primitive," how might I have concluded that there were gods and other spiritual flotsam in the universe? Sociobiological efforts to explain the origins of cultural/psychological phenomena seem to me at times similar in nature. Yet the sociobiologists are accorded a serious hearing, whereas only historical curiosity returns one to the "outmoded" armchair speculations of the 19th century. Have we come full circle to the period of grand speculation, terming it the "new synthesis" in order to accord respectability to what is at best "educated" guessing? Perhaps, but at present I do not think so. Barkow is among the most careful and cautious (more so in this paper than in his 1975 CA effort) of writers in sociobiology. The payoff for his writing currently is not in tracking down precise linkages between the genetic-structural and behavioral or cultural- structural spheres; it is, as he realizes, too early for that. Rather, a new question has emerged, and disciplinary bound- 2 Of course other such models exist, but few seem to me to be as satisfactory as that produced as offspring of the mating of biology and anthropology. We may, however, draw a distinction between models of cultural and psychological evolution from a biological perspective (for example, Henry 1959, Washburn 1967) and from a sociobiological perspective (the present paper immensely improves upon the penultimate remarks of both Wilson 1975 and Dawkins 1976). The work of Jaynes (1976) is ultimately untenable, but poses a number of interesting problems for orthodox model-makers. I think both biologists and anthropologists have neglected the stimulating ideas of Popper (1972), elaborated by Campbell (1974). Vol. 19 * No. 1 * March 1978 105</page><page sequence="8">aries are being threatened. Systems theory has shown that the whole can be greater than the sum of its parts. Sociobiological questions imply the same, as Barkow insists. As he phrases it, human normative behavior and self-awareness are limited by biological material, but not reducible to it. The mode of inference in sociobiology, finally, seems strongly teleological. Beginning with present sociocultural, psychological situations, sociobiologists offer plausible "just so" explanations about what might have occurred in the developmental sequence to produce them. The teleology involved is both similar to and different from the biological teleology involved in biological Darwinian evolution. (I am not implying conscious inten- tionality by primates or early hominids in either evolutionary argument, but simply pointing out that both arguments begin from an end point reached.) Sociobiological arguments such as Barkow's are different from Darwinian evolutionary arguments in that the physical sciences find empirical skeletal facts in a datable sequence involving various genera and species of pri- mates, including Homo sapiens. The sociobiologists do not have such empirical, sequential data. Their arguments rest on known behaviors of present-day primates, H. sapiens groups, and, at times, human infants (Barkow 1975a), among other sources of inferential data for reproducing the past. I have no problem with teleological arguments which are based on empirical data, but if such arguments continue for long without such data they approach a metaphysic rather than a science. I wish, in fact, that Barkow or someone else positively oriented toward socio- biological topics would specify what avenues of evidence- gathering in his opinion would satisfactorily address the topic. We have long since abandoned ethnographically described cultures in remote geographical settings as acceptable evidence for describing remote evolutionary stages of human develop- ment. What, precisely, will serve as evidence in the present debate? by ROBERTA H. HALL Department of Anthropology, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Ore. 97331, U.S.A. 9 ix 77 Barkow's paper represents a healthy turn in the anthropological evaluation of sociobiology in that it attempts to build a bridge between two opposing polemics. As Barkow notes (n. 1), his concept of the topic is broader than that with which sociobiology has come to be identified, namely, a narrow, hard-line Dar- winian view that behavior is selected essentially for one thing: maximization of gene duplication. Hallowell's interest in the evolution of human behavior and of the human situation led him to postulate protoculture and to recommend the study of other animals and their social systems, topics that now are prominent in cultural, physical, and linguistic anthropology. It is well established that other social animals-monkeys, for instance, and wolves-live in groups with social traditions that differ from unit to unit. Every adult monkey or wolf is not interchangeable with every other adult monkey or wolf. Though these animals apparently do not articulate codes of behavior, their traditions are analo- gous to Hallowell's norms. (Similarly, many peoples do not make their norms explicit, but anthropologists can infer them from the behavior of society members.) Are nonhuman be- havioral codes maintained by the concept of self, as Hallowell and Barkow suggest they are in human societies? In attempting to build a bridge between anthropology and sociobiology, Barkow analytically separates "biological altru- ism" from "moral altruism." Though operation of the latter does not conform to sociobiological rules, that of the former does. Barkow writes: "a given act either does or does not tend to increase one's inclusive fitness." Though the concept of two altruisms sounds eminently reasonable, it shouldl be examined further. Certainly it seems possible to determine whether certain acts reduce inclusive fitness; any act that is obviously self-destructive or randomly destructive of familv members reduces inclusive fitness. The more serious problem comes when we try to relate an "act" to the genetic system. How is a complex act, performed by one of the socially dependent higher mammals, related to the genetic system sufficiently directly for natural selection to act upon it? Sociobiologists generally get around this problem by assuming that behavioral tendencies, rather than acts, are inherited. According to the sociobiological perspective, the altruistic tendency is not invariable, like an ethologist's fixed action pattern, but exists to a greater or lesser extent in some individuals, in some situations, and in some species. This tendency must be selected for along with a data-gathering and processing capacity, of a complexity appropriate for the species in question, to mediate between the altruistic tendency and simple self-preservation. Further, sociobiology postulates that, with or without a moral code, an animal tends to be controlled by its altruistic rather than its self-preservation tendency when the object of the altruistic impulse is a close relative, particularly one whose reproductive years lie ahead. Empirically, a postu- lated tendency which is not always activated may prove difficult to substantiate. Obviously biological altruism is not easily separable from moral altruism either. This discussion leads to a further point regarding sociobiology and its practitioners. Styling themselves strikt interpreters of Darwinian evolution, they tend to interpret behavioral as well as genetic attributes at the lowest possible level of the biological system; hence Barkow's references to the pitfalls of reduction- ism. Attempts to be conservative in biological interpretations sometimes lead sociobiologists into another pitfall that I term gene mysticism. The dominant vision of evolutionary process is one of genes-minute strands of DNA, remember-seeking only one thing: their own replication (Dawkins 1976). All else is but history, in this perspective. Though it provides some interesting insights, this view, I submit, does not go far to explain the enormous diversity of animal behavior. Sociobiology has posed for anthropology an interesting problem and has already stimulated some productive research; that, and not the proposal of "final solutions" to life's riddles, is the role of science. If accepted as dogma, the sociobiological paradigm could cripple biology as well as anthropology. What I am suggesting is that contemporary anthropologists-follow- ing Barkow and Hallowell-can and should make further contributions to the study of biosocial phenomena in general and to a critical reinterpretation of sociobiology in particular. by WILLIAM IRONS Department of Anthropology, The Pennsylvania State Univer- sity, University Park, Pa. 16802, U.S.A. 19 x 77 I agree with Barkow that sociobiology must account for the malleability of human social behavior, the evolution of the capacity and propensity to invent and internalize cultural norms, and the evolution of self-awareness. I disagree with his lack of emphasis on natural selection as the process explaining why certain things evolve, his assumption that the reason for the variability of human behavior is that it is controlled by norms rather than genes, and the implication that reductionism is necessarily bad. At the risk of being negative, I will elaborate only on the points of disagreement. Barkow correctly points out that Hallowell addressed him- self to the question of what happened in human evolution rather than why it happened. He apparently fails to appreciate, however, that sociobiologists are concerned primarily with why certain behaviors evolve and therefore are unlikely to gain much from Hallowell's work. The strength of the theoretical ideas (Hamilton 1964; William 1966; Trivers 1971; Alexander 1974, 1975; West-Eberhard 1975; Wilson 1975) which have 106 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">Barkow: SOCIAL NORMS, THE SELF, AND SOCIOBIOLOGY come to be labeled sociobiology lies in their rigorous attempt to delineate logically the conditions under which natural selection will favor particular forms of behavior. The central question for sociobiology, ill reference to moral norms and self-awareness, is: What environmental conditions would cause selection to favor these traits? Trivers's (1971) theory of reciprocal altru- ism-a theory in which natural selection plays a central role- offers a promising explanation of why phenomena like norms evolved. Dawkins (1976:60-64), who also gives a central role to selection, offers some interesting suggestions on the evolution of the consciousness and self-awareness. I fail to see how Hallowell's ideas as presented by Barkow add anything further to the understanding of why these traits evolved. The mere observation that they did evolve seems to me a relatively minor contribution. It is incorrect for two reasons to imply that cultural and protocultural species vary their behavior because it is controlled by norms, whereas other species have constant behavior be- cause it is controlled by genes: (1) human beings vary their behavior for many reasons other than response to varying norms, and (2) genetically controlled behaviors are not neces- sarily constant. An empirically realistic model of the proximate factors generating variation in human behavior has been provided by Barth (1966, 1967). According to this model, behavior varies, both within a single society and among societies, because the constraints and incentives influencing choice among alter- native forms of behavior vary from one environment to an- other. Moral and jural norms are only part of the total array of factors influencing choice. Technological and ecological factors are at least as prominent as norms in causing people to find different kinds of behavior rewarding in different environments, and these other constraints do not always influence behavior through some intermediate moral norm. Purely pragmatic responses to different social situations are also prominent as causes of behavioral variation apart from what anthropologists commonly label norms (Bailey 1969). Models of this sort make better sense in combination with sociobiology than do models explaining behavioral variation in terms of a single proximate cause. Genetic influence on some aspect of behavior, or on any other characteristic of an organism, does not imply that the characteristic in question is constant. Genetic canalization of phenotypic change in response to environmental variation is a common evolved feature of organisms (Maynard Smith 1975: 19-26; Seger 1978). Many species exhibit flexibility of behavior without having either norms or culture (Wilson 1975:144-75). As scientists, we should evaluate theories in terms of their logic, parsimony, and ability to predict observable phenomena. Hallowell's ideas should be judged by these standards. Whether or not they lessen our risk of reductionism is irrelevant. The tradition in the social science of assuming all reductionism to be inevitably incorrect is without logical foundation. by JEFFREY A. KURLAND Department of Anthropology, The Pennsylvania State Univer- sity, University Park, Pa. 16801, U.S.A. 26 ix 77 This sociobiologist welcomes Barkow to that group of biological and social scientists who wish to deal with the scientific issues raised by any attempt to biologize anthropology, psychology, or sociology. Barkow's paper is most stimulating and, of course, considers many more topics than can be commented on in this short correspondence. "Sociobiology" is a name for a set of models and concepts derived from contemporary population ecology and genetics that appear to have some bearing on our understanding of the evolution of social behavior. These models have in common the precise and powerful use of Darwinian natural selection (the nonrandom replication of genes) for explanations of behavioral adaptations (e.g., Dawkins 1976, Wilson 1975). To test pre- dictions from such models, one must collect data on behavioral and population-biological variables for members of a particular study population. In this sense, Hallowell does not appear to have ever done anything resembling sociobiology, and his importance to this field is moot. It is not at all clear how the "self," which Hallowell and Barkow claim is "culturally constituted," fits into contemporary sociobiology. What Hallowell or Barkow finds significant about the "self" concept may be orthogonal to a sociobiology program. If the self, self-awareness, and consciousness play a role in sociobiological theory or are to be explained by evolutionary biological models, then it must be shown that Barkow's analysis of the self is either heuristic or accurate. For Barkow the conscious mind, the self, and its own awareness represent a complex information-processing system that provides for ex- ceedingly precise representations of the individual's environ- ment. Dawkins (1976) also suggests a computer-simulation metaphor for consciousness and the mind. But assuming that the self and self-awareness are part of a system that accurately pictures the external and internal world is to beg the question of the ultimate evolutionary causes of such mental phenomena. Perhaps what we ordinarily call and experience as the self is merely an epiphenomenon-not even an adaptation. The DNA nucleotides that unfold through particular developmental pathways within particular environments into functional human nervous systems also produce ancillary mental/behavioral traits that are labelled as "I," "thought," or "feeling" because of unique historical and linguistic processes. Rather than causes of behavior, as Barkow and others assume, the self may be only an accidental by-product, a pleiotropic effect, of other, more necessary biological processes, taking on significance only within some possible human societies. Thus, mind and behavior, rather than being related as cause and effect, may both be effects, freely varying with respect to each other. There are, after all, a number of religious and philosophical schools (e.g., Zen Buddhism) that entreat followers to cast off the illusion, the artifact, of self. Some practitioners claim to have done just that. Again, one might consider the unconscious/ conscious or private/public self dualities to be an invention of Western civilization, created only several thousand years ago in the singular logico-linguistic environment characteristic of Socratic Greece. The self understood in this way is not only "culturally constituted," it is culturally marked or ignored as fortuitous circumstance dictates. Biologists have recently considered the evolution of deception and self-deception as a critical factor in the evolution of soci- ality, particularly for our own species (Dawkins 1976; Maynard Smith and Parker 1976; Trivers 1971, 1976). It may sometimes be adaptive for an individual to communicate to a conspecific competitor that it is bigger or stronger than it really is. Such "deception" may take on a powerful competitive edge during protracted agonistic encounters (e.g., the bright color and gill- plate extension in Betta splendens [Maynard Smith 1972]). The ability to spot such deception may become valuable, and complex systems of bluff, detection, and counter-bluff may evolve. Under such selective pressure, it may also be adaptive for an individual to be "unconscious" about the nature of its own deceptive tactics. "Self-deception" allows the initial deception to be more convincing by masking any signs of deception that the actor might let slip by mistake. Warping the self through self-deception certainly suggests that "the conventional view that natural selection favors nervous systems which produce ever more accurate images of the world must be a very naive view of mental evolution" (Trivers 1976:vi). Thus, one might consider the self and concomitant mental states to be an adaptive system allowing individuals better to Vol. 19 * No. 1 * March 1978 107</page><page sequence="10">picture, predict, and model the environment; or a nonadaptive (or perhaps, maladaptive) side effect; or an adaptive system preventing the individual from interfering with its own gene strategies. There are, no doubt, other models, each one, perhaps, accurately portraying some aspect of the human nervous system and mind. However, the inordinately and traditionally thorny phenomenon of self must be translated into operationally defined behavioral variables that can be measured by anv human observer if competing models of mental events and evolution are to be accurately tested. Scientific hypothesis testing ought to replace sterile speculation. It remains to be demonstrated that mentalistic constructs add anything to any analysis of behavior (e.g., Griffin 1976). Moreover, the philo- sophical problems associated with mental events/states and "the problem of other minds" are formidable and not to be lightly dismissed by biological and social scientists (e.g., Wittgenstein 1953). Barkow provides not a testable model of the self and its relationship to behavior, but a stimulating computer metaphor and an evolutionary scenario reminiscent of the science-fiction stcries epidemic in the 1960s, when anthropologists attempted to reconstruct the social life of early man without regard for natural selection theory. Indeed, by not using natural selection, Barkow creates some rather unwieldy dichotomies that preclude a real functional analysis of human behavior, thoughts, and morals. For example, Barkow states that "human behavior can vary so enormously because it is always controlled by the local normative system rather than by a tight genetic program." Barkow apparently conceives of the gene as though DNA were a switch that "causes" the individual to exhibit immediately and directly a bit of behavior, physiology, or morphology. Yet a "norm-of-reaction" model for gene effects, corroborated by many data, pictures the individual's genotype as a mechanism that developmentally maps specific environments onto specific behavior, physiology, or morphology (Schmalhausen 1949). The proximate cause of any behavior is, therefore, necessarily environmental. Indeed, a given genotype may either generate facultative or obligate adaptive responses within the norm of reaction for the environments in which it has evolved (Williams 1966). Put another way, the trial-and-error learning process of evolution creates a memory machine that retains, to varying degrees, the correct responses to the environments in which it has been tested. Thus, today's phenotypes are yesterday's adaptations. The concept of a "tight genetic program" is quite misleading. How is any organism's behavior, let alone human social behavior, tightly "controlled" by DNA? How does control by a local normative system entail more free will or more variation for human behavior than behavior controlled only ultimately, not proximately, by DNA? What exactly is a "local normative system," and how did it evolve? The very idea of individuals' being controlled by a system beyond, or emergent to, the individuals implies individual sacrifice for the benefit of the group system. But such group selection represents a basic misunderstanding of the nature and generation of adaptation by natural selection (Williams 1966). Sociobiology ought to be able to account for some of the diversity of human social behavior, as Barkow desires. But surely it is obvious that some forms of variability require no biological explanation. For example, it seems reasonable to suggest that listening to the Eagles or to Hayden probably has little effect on one's inclusive fitness. However, the differences between human residence, mating, and kinship patterns are open to biological analysis (e.g., Kurland 1978). Part of a sociobiology program requires a definition of what types of social variables can be explained by the ecological and demo- graphic variables found in evolutionary models. Thus, it is at this time somewhat premature to saddle sociobiology with the necessity of accounting for the Human Self (whatever that is) or to demand that sociobiologists resolve the peculiar issues that have plagued philosophers for thousands of years. There are simpler, and equally important, questions that can be raised and answered: How much of the variance in observed social behavior is accounted for by the variance in genetic relatedness among human actors? To what degree do human "birth control" practices represent individual or group adapta- tions, or maladaptations? To what extent do the parental investment and reproductive strategies of human actors account for the alliance, marriage, and mating patterns ob- served? These are difficult enough questions for anthropologists and biologists, yet they at least have the virtue that the tech- niques for providing answers are readily available, that is, the underlying models can be falsified. Science is often characterized by a reduction of a complex phenomenon to simpler, and ideally more comprehensible, concepts. To save sociobiology from the evil of reductionism (as Barkow nobly volunteers) is to cleanse it of scientific explanation. Social scientists have turned the cry of "reduction- ism!" into a tired and worn-out litany whose only function appears to be to keep the social sciences distinct from the natural sciences by providing a test of orthodoxy. If anthro- pologists do not want to be scientists, because they, for reasons never made intelligible, fear "reductionism," then they must face competition from Mick Jagger, George Lucas, Hunter Thompson, John Fowles, Andy Warhol, Bob Dylan, Tom Wolfe, Frank Herbert, and other real artists of culture. by LESLIE SUE LIEBERMAN Department of Anthropology, GPA B378, University of Florida, Gainesville, Fla. 32601, U.S.A. 20 ix 77 Barkow's article is a refreshing change from the sociobiological diatribe which has appeared in recent months in both the popular press and scholarly journals. Barkow has written a well-reasoned and responsible article which is a welcome addi- tion to the anthropological literature and which should provide scholars with a theoretical model for the further examination of problems in human ethology, biobehavioral evolution, socializa- tion, and acculturation. Explanations of the coevolution of human biology and human behavior present a serious problem in that a theory must account for the differential propagation of cultural traits as the cause of differential reproductive success (Durham 1976). Specifically, the "genetic assimilation of culturally acquired characteristics" becomes simply an antiquated Lamarckian notion unless one can show that the characteristic in question, in this case normative behavior, is selectively advantageous for the individual or at least enhances his inclusive fitness. Dawkins (1976) argues that the Darwinian notion of "the good of the species" is no longer a tenable explanation for the evolu- tion of many biobehavioral characteristics seen throughout the animal kingdom. Hallowell's views clearly hinge on this idea rather than on the basic evolutionary focus of gene replication through individual self action. Barkow's two sociobiological explanations and one psycho- social one for the development of human normative behavior, offered in an attempt to coalesce cultural and evolutionary theorv, seem to me of no more value than the reductionistic theories of Dawkins (1976), Hamilton (1975), or Trivers (1971). In fact, by labeling some acts as illustrating "moral altruism" (altruism in the original biological sense) and other acts as illustrating "biological altruism" (reciprocal altruism in the original biological sense) and by stating that "human social norms are products not of biological, but of sociocultural, evolution," he has clearly separated the two realms of evolution. One is organic, biological evolution, which can be explained in sociobiological and Darwinian terms; the other is sociocultural evolution, which must be explained in terms of the special dynamics of the superorganic. 108 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">Barkow: SOCIAL NORMS, THE SELF, AND SOCIOBIOLOGY One could easily argue that nonnormative behavior (in- cluding, as Barkow mentions, rationalizations and self-decep- tion) may enhance a person's fitness. Dawkins (1976) clearly shows that in a society in which most of the individuals are "suckers" and will perform altruistic acts for everyone, the selfish "cheat" who gains from altruistic acts but does not reciprocate has a reproductive advantage. In a baboon troop, for example, individuals who are dominant are in the minority and have fewer behavioral restrictions than those who are subordinate and in the majority. Dominant males in fact have preferential access to food and mates and contribute more of their genes to subsequent generations. The same situation exists in human societies as well. The pressure for conformity and reciprocity does arise, however, when "grudgers" appear in a population (Trivers 1971, Dawkins 1976). Grudgers, unlike suckers and cheaters, remember who reciprocates their altruistic acts and who does not and avoid cheaters after the first encounter. Recognition is the key to grudger success and is perhaps the reductionistic explanation equivalent to Hallowell's concepts of self and self- awareness. Grudger genes will become lost in populations with a large number of cheater genes, but if the grudger genes reach a critical number, their reproductive chances are enhanced enough to offset the reduced cost/benefit ratio of altruistic behavior toward cheaters. Suckers have always reciprocated when grudgers performed altruistic acts. At the level of the gene, individual, and population, both the reductionistic theories of Trivers and the more holistic attempts of Hallowell fall short of explaining how grudger genes or normative be- havior could have evolved so that the number of individuals in a population possessing these genes or the genetic substrate for these behaviors would reach a sustaining level in spite of cheaters who easily maximize their fitness through nonrecipro- cation. Much theoretical and substantive work needs to be done. Barkow's paper has greatly stimulated my own thinking and should serve as a model for future thinking within the new sociobiological paradigm. by A. K. MARK Otago University, Dunedin, New Zealand. 18 viii 77 Barkow believes that we should continue to build upon the base established by Hallowell. I would agree, but feel that the base needs some redefinition and Barkow's position on "self" needs some modification. The problem of definition of "being," the "self," andi "self-consciousness" is of long standing in social philosophy and social psychology. I would suggest that the problem is deeper than this, being fundamentally one of the definition of "mind." I shall take one of Barkow's statements as an entry point, modify it somewhat, then argue for these modifications. If the parental and dominant individuals were well-represented in our cognitive maps, so too was another individual whose existence and present state was of crucial importance to us-the self. What do we call an information-processing system which simulates external real- ity and constantly monitors that reality in order to maintain maxi- mum congruence between its internal representations and the exter- nal, and simultaneously monitors its own state and its relationship to the external in order to maintain the accuracy of an internal repre- sentation of itself? Do we not describe such a system as self-aware? As self-conscious? My modification of this passage would read: Some current thinking in social psychology could be para- phrased as follows: Parental and dominant members of proto- hominid and contemporary primate social groups were im- portant and mapped themselves upon the cognitive maps of individual members. These were Other. The remaining indi- vidual whose state of being and present existence was most important was oneself, the Self. This totality of Self and Other can be looked at from the viewpoint of the experiencing, inter- nalizing self, which becomes not only other-conscious but also self-conscious. This latter state can be considered an "informa- tion-processing system" that can communicate with others and with itself and that attempts to match "external" events and "reality" (of existence) with its own system (of being). It tries to mesh these externals with its "internal" representations and monitors these representations in terms of relationships, for example, degree of accuracy, congruence, compatibility, etc. This is commonly called "a self-conscious process" because the system must, in this process, also monitor its own behaviour, its own representations, etc. Some contemporary theorists have considered such a system as a cybernetic system, an analogical computer, and even an "ecology of mind" (Bateson 1973:375- 76), in which some component (individual, self, mind, or what- ever) has to monitor both itself and that which is not itself and continuously (although variably) adjust the relationship be- tween the two. Hence, it is not only an open adaptive system, but also usually a self-correcting system. My question is, What performs this operation? "Being," the "individual," the "self," the brain? I would answer that, rather than any of these, it is the mind. It is this "mind" which is self-conscious (or, preferably, self-aware) and monitors these representations. First, anything that is self-reflective as well as mapping relations with external things should not/cannot be treated as either an object or a nonobject. Anthropologists are interested in problems of life, systematic as well as nonsystematic (Wittgenstein 1961:147-51 notwith- standing), and particularly in the "mental life" of the genus Homo. We attempt to experience and then to report upon the variety of affective and cognitive realms some of us believe we encounter in ourselves and others or hypothetically reconstruct for the past. Many of us believe these exist. W"e even attempt to understand such modes or modalities as may be termed "mysti- cal," "witchcraft," "schizophrenic," etc., "thought"-difficult realms, to say the least, particularly if those of an "alien" psychocultural system. Subsequently, some of us attempt to perform abstractions upon these fields of experience. Such things as "thinking" and "feeling," then, can be experience as well as conceptual abstractions of experience or referring to experience. (In fact, an individual may also "experience" a concept, but this is a hotly debated issue.) Consequently, both as anthropologists and as human beings, we do some rather peculiar, although interesting, things. We may experience the mind. We at least try to report upon the abstractions we make of this mental realm, these phe- nomena, as well as any other realms we may somehow manage to internalize (i.e., "learn"). Can we learn to experience some- thing that is neither object nor nonobject? Obviously, I think so, and want to do so, but how? What is it really, or what can I say about how it may exist? These questions (of mind) are the fundamental ones of this argument. I have indicated one, although provisional and perhaps enigmatic, answer. A thing that exists as it experiences itself is neither an object nor a nonobject (Western logic notwith- standing). Nevertheless, we report upon the abstractions we construct of this mental realm. To reduce this realm to a solely subjective phenomenon or a solipsistic position is no construc- tive answer. Existence is more than just a subjective phe- nomenon; to say that one cannot know of any other minds besides one's own is an intellectual dead end too. I will grant, however, that experience itself is primarily subjective, no more. The mind is unique, peculiar, even irrational. It is not just something subjective, because it can experience both itself and existence, form representations of these, and perform abstrac- Vol. 19 No. 1 March 1978 109</page><page sequence="12">tions upon subjective or objective phenomena (in a nonexclusive sense).' In any event, I would at least suppose that the mind is that (hypothetical) entity that does "accountings for". Must not something that experiences, has knowledge of exis- tence, and is assumed to be "connected to" one or more indi- vidual beings as well as to a "behavioural environment" at the very least exist? Mind, not self, is the only thing I can think of that both fulfills these conditions and then accounts for such phenomena (including itself). For instance, I cannot now say that being or self is neither an object nor a nonobject,2 because the self can be other to another self (or other), and there are beings that are not conscious. Consequently, I conclude that mind not only is a valid concept, but has a valid psychological reality and exists as an "entity" of some sort. If the mind could be shown to experience, then it would be more than just a concept in this case. If the mind is that which generates concepts and psychological and cultural "realities," then these are consequences of mind, and knowledge is a product or manifestation of mind.3 Genus Homo is the only sort of being I know of that does these sorts of things. Hence, it is positable that mind is the essential characteristic or, more extremely, the essence of the genus Homo. Mind, not the "self," is that entity which is aware, both prior to, during, and after the fact. It is the mind that is "self-conscious." The mind is aware of self and other beings, the experience of the self, the behaviour of other beings. The moot, perhaps nonsensical, question is whether the mind experiences experience (or, perhaps, whether the mind experi- ences itself-experiences that which does the experiencing). Is this a semantic or a real problem? Would it not be sensible to say that that is that thing which is aware of awareness, or aware of being aware? Is this not a reflective relation of sorts, or what some might call a self-reflexive, or self-reflective, relationship? Do we not reflect upon ourselves? This is not a semantic game I am playing. The mind, in my opinion, does precisely this, i.e., is thus aware of its experience. What does this boil down to? I would think that it means that there are beings, that there are life beings, there are life beings that have selves. Further, a human being has a self, and this type of being has mental experience. It is the mind of this self-reflective being that both experiences and internalizes. At this point, awareness of being and existence are simultaneously realized. At this point, mental awareness, i.e., awareness of awareness, occurs. At this point, semantic meaning can be assigned and, finally, metasemantic meaning can be derived. (What is "meaning," basically, anyway, except the putting of at least one point in space?) The mind is not a chaos or an undifferentiated stuff. Nothing could be aware here if such were the case. It is some (non- objective) "something." Only when the human mind dies, or confronts itself and/or destroys itself, can it possibly become chaos. True madness, madness in which reconstruction can never occur, may be of this nature. In this case, it becomes for all practical purposes "something which is nothing" (Paz [1970:ii, 39] notwithstanding). Except for noting this extreme, I am not interested in this case. "One cannot not communicate" (Watzlawick et al. 1967:48- 52), even with oneself. Even in silence, we communicate. Being and self are not aware per se; only the minds of some beings with selves are aware. The problem of mind is the key to a "principia anthro- pologica." It is more than philosophy or psychology will yet yield. by LARRY L. NAYLOR Anthropology Program, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, Alaska 99701, U.S.A. 19 ix 77 This article comes at a most opportune time in the continuing debate over sociobiology. Sociobiology is not particularly new; it has been around for some years and known by a variety of names. What is new is the intensity with which it is now being applied to human social behavior. The question being debated is an old one: How much of human behavior is biological and how much is cultural? In the current debate, the lack of good scholarly exchange is all too apparent. This is an old affliction in anthropology when- ever we attempt to consider new ideas. Initially, extreme and usually emotional positions are espoused on both sides of the issue. Their advocates seem intent on making their point rather than listening to what is being said. Many who eagerly join the ranks of proponents or opponents simply have not bothered to read up on the idea. Barkow's article is a hopeful sign that the more serious business of assessing sociobiology for what it can do and identifying its strengths and weaknesses has now begun. The author has resisted the temptation to dismiss the idea outright, electing instead to evaluate it in terms of his own interests and expertise. With such efforts, we may now be ready to determine the value of sociobiology for the under- standing of human behavior. Human behavior is undoubtedly the result of both biological and cultural factors. Anthropologists have said this for years, although they have not specified how. No one can deny that Hallowell did attempt the connection. Barkow points out what he perceives as a weakness in sociobiology, the lack of adequate consideration of the concept of self, which was given much attention by Hallowell. He goes on to direct our attention to human diversity and plasticity. This is a clear warning against the simplistic tendencies of sociobiologists who have largely concentrated their efforts on animals with a much closer attachment to the environment (itself a little more stable than that of the human group). It is reasonable to expect that humans were and are subject to the same evolutionary principles as other animals. The human animal is unique in that it is guided by both biological and cultural patterns. The mutual feedback between these patterns belies attempts to reduce to either a biological or a culturally constituted answer. If one follows the sociobiologist's argument on inclusive fitness and the kin selection based on this fitness, the logical conclusion is that both are continually involved in a process yet incomplete. The basic evolutionary principles may remain the same in man as in other animals, but the results can be quite different. Looking only at the results and looking only at the principles are simply two different levels of approach to the question. Neither level is sufficient to unravel the complexity of the human species. If sociobiology can help in the resolution of the problem, it should be carefully examined, not rejected on emotional grounds or because some may not like the answers it might lead us to. To be complete, sociobiology will have to combine and absorb psychology, anthropology, and sociology. Barkow's article can serve a number of functions beyond that already suggested. It enjoins those of us who do not really know what is being debated to find out about it-to determine what is being said by sociobiology-before jumping on the bandwagon or joining the opposition. As I read the sociobiologists, up to now only suggestions have been made. There is much to be done, to be tested and studied, before sufficient grounds are established for acceptance or rejection. There are serious questions to be posed and answered. In the final analysis, the idea will be accepted or rejected, modified I Many would doubt not only the existence of mind, but even whether the mind can experience. I see their point, but in this argu- ment I suppose both these things. 2 Some mystics amongst us notwithstanding-particularly those of the Madhyamika school, who might say "netineti" ("not this either!"). I I believe both these statements are true, and also consider both cases to have a priori and a posteriori pretensions. 110 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="13">Barkow: SOCIAL NORMS, THE SELF, AND SOCIOBIOLOGY substantially or in part. One thing is certain: it is up to all of us to determine whether it is lacking, valuable, or just another armchair notion of academia. by JOHN PADDOCK Instituto de Estudios Oaxaquenos, A partado 464, Oaxaca, Oax., Mexico. 12 ix 77 Since many readers have little or no remembered experience of the 1930s and 1940s, one may explain that biological determin- ism, deeply rooted in feudal Europe, reached a climax in the psychotic racism of Hitler and others. It was an error, but an understandable one, for the profession in 1949 to be still "celebrating its victory over the bad biology of social Darwinism by discarding all consideration of the evolution of human behavior." I would add that it discarded too the possibility of any significant role for biological heredity in determining personality: the anthropological study of personality was called "culture and personality," and the significant if perhaps overenthusiastic works of Sheldon (Sheldon, Stevens, and Tucker 1940, Sheldon and Stevens 1942, Sheldon, Hartl, and McDermott 1949) were either ignored or condemned for the evil that might come from misusing Sheldon's ideas. If it is precisely the limits on and central tendencies of human social behavior that are most biological and least cultural, it is fair that cultural anthropologists be called upon to account for them just as the sociobiologists must account for humanity's behavioral malleability and diversity. I remember having to search out nonanthropological works on animal behavior and human endocrinology in the 1950s to supplement customary anthropological works for a "culture and personality" course. In his practically Pleistocene (1949) presidential address, Hallowell quickly takes us back via citations to the 1870s, and then to 1725. Wisdom did not begin with The New .. . ology. I had forgotten how much I owe Hallowell, and thank Barkow for reminding me. Moderating one statement by Barkow, we might propose that human social norms are products more of sociocultural than of biological evolution, an evolution constrained by the biologics of our species but not usually reducible to that. Regarding the sequence of moral development studied by Kohlberg and others, a couple of works by Loevinger (1976; Loevinger and Wessler 1970) should also be noted. Sociobiology (cf. the citation of Emlen) would obviously fail to predict the existence of antiviolent communities that are biologically and ecologically indistinguishable from their violence-prone neighbors. The key difference is in norms and self-concept, of which the concept of community is necessarily a large part (El Guindi and Selby 1976:185-86). The persistence, among neighboring cheaters in several parts of the world, of antiviolent societies encourages some skepticism about "Bigelow's (1973) argument that man evolved as a self-predator, with constant warfare among local groups" (Paddock 1975, 1976a). Up to now, my coworkers and I had not examined anti- violence in Mexico as altruism or considered the cheating problem that quickly follows such an examination. Obviously, an antiviolent community that virtually eliminates homicide among its members is at an immediate biological advantage with respect to its violence-prone neighbors. (Other significant advantages, such as a lower level of anxiety over physical security, also accrue to it.) But, if being a man-killer is bio- logically desirable, in the long run the antiviolent community will suffer because killer males will not give more to the local heredity than will nonkillers. The difference between an antiviolent community and its violence-prone neighbors may profitably be stated as an absence of cheaters in the antiviolent place, for lip service to an antiviolent ideal is common in violence-prone places, and of course only a small proportion of their males are killers, who may thus be considered cheaters (Paddock 1976b). Cheaters of any kind, however, hinder the operation of a society, and may even threaten it; and humans do not survive without a society. The balance between individual needs and the demands of society has limits at both extremes. Thus altruism may, quite biologically, be rather general, favoring not necessarily some individual but the society-and the society is much more than the simple pool of genes. (As Barkow notes, corner-cutting and rationalization are common and may lead to weakening and loss of fitness for the society. This makes a rather satisfactory definition of a phe- nomenon I have been examining in archeology: decadence.) At an early stage of social evolution, social units were kin units. In a typically near-endogamous peasant village of even 1,000 or 2,000 inhabitants, i.e., a large face-to-face or primary group, unselfish behavior among community members is still, to a significant extent, altruism among kinsmen. We have long suspected that when an antiviolent village becomes a town, and loses much of its primary-group face-to-face character, it may also lose the possibility of consensus on antiviolence that controls cheaters. Regarding Trivers's "moral aggression," one principal rule enforced in antiviolent communities forbids killing even in revenge for killing; thus the infrequent homicide that does occur is prevented from becoming a vendetta. Norm violation no doubt is universal and inevitable, as Alexander is quoted as observing. However, individual norm- lessness is psychopathy or sociopathy; collective normlessness would be chaos, nonsociety, and extinction for our hopelessly social species. by MARIA JULIA POURCHET R. Cupertino Durao, 131-Leblon, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 20.000. 14 ix 77 A renewed sociobiology, built and based on the ideas of Hallo- well, is Barkow's scope in this article. He points to Hallowell's advice to anthropologists "to concern themselves with the evolution of behavior and not just with morphology." He so clearly describes Hallowell as a real pioneer sociobiologist that I can agree that "his work is crucial for an understanding of the evolution of human behavioral diversity." The most important aspect of Barkow's paper is precisely its pointing out the evolutionary explanation of traits which do indeed separate us from most, though perhaps not all, other social animals. He argues that self and social norm are a challenge to socio- biology that should not be ignored, without, however, explain- ing clearly what the reductionism of which sociobiology is accused really means. In my opinion, the greatest value of the article is its review of Hallowell's work, the most significant contributions being Hallowell 1963 and 1955. Incidentally, I would recommend that serious attention be given to the way sociobiology is being disseminated lately by magazines, television, and other communication media. by DUANE QUIATT Division of Social Sciences, Anthropology, University of Colorado at Denver, 1100 14th St., Denver, Colo. 80202, U.S.A. 9 ix 77 Hallowell's attention to the continuities as well as the dis- continuities between nonhominid and evolving hominid be- havior, and his contributions to a not-so-neatly bounded set of ideas concerning the complex relations that obtain between animals and their environment, group dynamics, and feedback Vol. 19 * No. 1 * March 1978 111</page><page sequence="14">between genetic and social behavioral change, clearly make him an important pioneer of sociobiology, if sociobiology be taken to refer to that increasingly sophisticated interdis- ciplinary perspective on evolutionary biology that began to define itself in mid-century. His position with respect to that specific, theoretically distinct set of sociogenetic ideas which began to receive wide dissemination in the mid-1960s (and which were conjoined, perhaps prematurely, with the former in one sociobiological package by E. 0. Wilson in 1975) is, I think, not at all as clearly significant. Interesting as Barkow's suggestions are, I find it difficult to agree either that reduction- ism is an evil always and forever to be avoided or that building on the ideas of Hallowell will help to avoid reductionism in sociogenetic theory. A major virtue of sociogenetic theory is that it affords precise and consistent generalizations from which hypotheses can be derived which are, if not always subject to simple empirical tests, at least subject to debate in terms of readily discernible logic. Sociogenetic theory does, of course, deal with ultimate, not proximate, causes of behavioral adaptation, but reductionism in this sense is hardly a weakness; it is what gives that theory its unitary character as a body of explanatory concepts. If in concluding that "the ideas of self and social norm are a challenge to sociobiology" Barkow means that we have a lot to learn about proximate causes of behavioral adaptation, I doubt that many will care to argue the point. It seems to me unlikely, however, that such deductively conceived concepts as protoculture and protonorms, internal representa- tions, cognitive mapping, self, etc.-useful though they may be when employed as heuristic aids in a conjectural reconstruc- tion of general "stages" of hominid evolution-will ever lead to a very detailed understanding of the mechanisms that link gene and behavior, not to mention changes in genetic and in social structure. Barkow recognizes that these are "sof t" concepts, but it doesn't bother him. He compares them with Hockett and Ascher's language design features and suggests that "we may quarrel with Hockett and Ascher's ideas as to how we developed language, but not with their presentation of what is to be explained (e.g., displacement, duality of pat- tern, and so on)." Well, of course we can quarrel with that presentation; Hockett himself, if I am not mistaken, revised his categories more than once. The main problem with "soft" concepts is that they tend to be slippery as well, subject to redefinition every time you have a moment free to review the situation. I agree with Barkow that "sociobiology must account for the diversity and malleability of human social behavior, rather than content itself with pointing out its limits and central tendencies," but not with what seems to be implied in that assertion: that pointing out limits and central tendencies on some simple descriptive-statistics level is a central concern of sociogenetic theorists. Barkow himself points out that, at least where the evolution of conformity and nonconformity to norms is concerned, modern sociogenetic theorists have been better able to deal with diversity than was Hallowell. A full accounting of human cultural diversity would be contingent on a thorough- going investigation of local norms-what they are and how they get that way. Since this is a central issue with Barkow, and since he decries reductionism, I wonder why he rules out, as a subject appropriate to his paper, the question of how local norms vary in response to local ecological pressures. by ANTHONY SHAFTON c/o Riverstone Press, P.O. Box 40068, Portland, Ore. 97240, U.S.A. 3 ix 77 Barkow convincingly maintains that normative behavior-in- ternal monitoring of self and others for conformity to learned roles-evolved because it promotes ecological lability by po- tentiating diversity in social action, and thereby in social struc- ture. Barkow recognizes that certain important components of the normative constellation, notably internal representation of others and the self, must have appeared before norms them- selves, and he conjectures that the selective conditions favoring such complex "protonormative" modes of awareness also relate to ecological lability, but at a simpler level, where direct com- parisons may be drawn to nonhuman species. This part of the argument should be refined to allow for the observation that among nonhuman primates (and many other animals) social structural variation is regularly achieved merely by differential emphasis upon species-typical motivations and their associated behavior patterns. Indeed, among primate species the greatest intraspecific variation has been reported for those apparently lacking a well-developed self-concept and giving little evidence of internal representation. If ecovariability in general is insuffi- cient basis for Darwinian explanation of these additional be- havior mechanisms, what particular features of an ecological strategy might call them forth? A novel technological strategy such as armed hunting might, but there are many reasons to suspect that technological subsistence itself presupposes the psychological traits in question and that they therefore arose earlier in hominid phylogeny. An earlier function is suggested by the chimpanzee adaptation. Whatever variety may be found in monkey troop structures, each troop is itself relatively per- sistent and cohesive in space. In contrast, chimpanzee com- munities exhibit not only structural variation from site to site and season to season, but also unique internal flexibility, such that a coherent social unit may be composed of individuals who have never all gathered together. Barkow's protopsychology of norms, which is found in chimpanzees, may have evolved for both chimpanzees and hominids in connection with an ecological strategy of spatiotemporal dispersion within such a social unit. For an animal whose social life entails long separations and fortuitous reunions among recognized individuals, internal rep- resentation has the plausible function of keeping the networks of social identities and connections fresh in lieu of continuous reinforcements from ever-present companions. Barkow might have made this surmise himself, since his most "striking" feature of internal representation is, precisely, awareness "in the absence of" a referent; and I will guess that he would have drawn much the same conclusion had he been less intent upon finding preadaptations for normative behavior itself. Thus he correctly attempts to reconstruct occurrences of awareness-in-the-absence-of-a-referent, as evidence of preadap- tation for awareness-when-no-referent-is-possible-that is, awareness involving an abstract norm; however, he unneces- sarily restricts his conjectures about behaviors containing such a preadaptation to those with a more or less normative func- tion: internalized constraints upon behavior while the mother or the dominant is (for unspecified reasons) absent. But a preadaptation need have no functional connection to the later adaptation (e.g., agonistic or antipredatory branching to predatory clubbing); and in the present case, it fits quite well with Barkow's larger scenario to find a less closely allied function for internal representation: not enforcement of con- straints on offspring and subordinates in the absence of mothers and dominants, but maintenance of cohesion among all mem- bers of a spatiotemporally dispersed social unit. I agree that internal representation and the self-concept evolved conjointly. After all, experiencing inside requires a per- ceptual inside/outside dichotomy-inside and outside of what? (And it is the phenomenology that counts, since all representa- tions, including those projected, are internal to the nervous system.) Thus the self-concept may have evolved reciprocally with a socioecological strategy of the sort described. As indi- cated in n. 4, I have elsewhere argued (Shafton 1976) that internal manipulations of the self-image in relation to images of others emerged in connection with status behavior (per- 112 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="15">Barkow: SOCIAL NORMS, THE SELF, AND SOCIOBIOLOGY ceptually the most complex aspect of behavior, at all primate levels). This is to say, first, that the social network maintained by Barkow's protonormative psychology was primarily the set of status relationships; and, second, that this psychology not only served for cognitive retention, but also provided proximate mechanisms of status interaction suited to a social system involving long separations, sudden reunions, and continuously reassorted groupings. A shift to agonism in the form of conflict between identities promoted cohesion in this labile society by reducing the danger of overt aggression and by allowing for greater integration of agonistic and affiliative tendencies into status relationships. These status mechanisms entail, for the subordinate, ego defenses such as those discussed by Barkow here and elsewhere and, for the dominant, what we now some- times call self-actualization. Support for these connections between status and self-awareness may be drawn from con- tinuities between perceptual defenses and ego defenses attribut- able to monkey and chimpanzee status behavior, respectively, as well as from continuities between these nonhuman primate adaptations and the range of qualities (both cognitive and affective) associated with our own- self-consciousness. by CECIL R. WELTE Apartado Postal 387, Oaxaca de Juarez, Oax., Mexico. 29 viii 77 Barkow effectively presents Hallowell's concepts of self and of social norms, but there are some deeper implications in Hallo- well's work that should be taken into consideration. In his 1949 presidential address (1950) he not only pointed the way to the study of the evolution of human behavior, but showed that the evolution of mind must be dealt with. He linked the study of mind to the study of symbolism in the broad sense of the "symbolic transformation of experience." A definition of mind is implicit in his address, and is congruent with a recent formu- lation by Lidz (1976:22): "By means of our brains we manipu- late symbols, and without these symbols we cannot think. What we term 'mind' includes both the complex neural appara- tus and the symbolized material gained from experience that it utilizes." Mind includes many types of symbolism in addition to the conventional symbolism of culture. In the first part of his address Hallowell dealt with symbolism in the broad sense befitting an "inclusive approach to . . . the evolution of man," and stated that the problem of mental evolution is the deeper question that must be faced. Halfway through the address he explicitly narrowed his discussion to the social matrix in which mind (or the capacity for symbolization) developed. He was not laying a foundation for equating the evolution of human behavior with the evolution of social forms, but, as a social scientist, was turning his attention to the social setting and to his view of culture as one part of human psychobiological structure. In pursuit of a "new synthesis" we must pay attention to his broader formulations, and to the question he posed in the second paragraph of his address: "Even the concept of human nature in the minds of some has become relativistic-relalivistic, that is, to the particular cultural form through which it is empirically manifest. But if this is so, what is the emergence of a cultural mode of adaptation a function of?" Here specieswide human nature must be taken into consideration. We must view per- sonality structure and functioning as human developments in a social matrix, and not as social or cultural products. In a later paper (1960:361) Hallowell wrote: "the psychological basis of culture lies not only in a capacity for highly complex forms of learning but in a capacity for transcending what is learned; a potentiality for innovation, creativity, reorganization and change." This is the capacity with which the study of the evolution of human behavior must deal. Jt is based on the "symbolic transformation of experience" that characterizes human nature and is the root of culture itself as well as of culture change. It provides the basis for a fourth explanation for human normative behavior (in addition to the three Barkow lists) and is the development that must be explained as the precondition to the move beyond protoculture. by JAN WIND Institute of Human Genetics and Department of Otorhino- laryngology, Free University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 18 ix 77 The science called sociobiology can only be viable when the wide gulf between sociology and biology can be bridged. As long as there are no proper sociobiologists, this can best be attempted by sociologists and biologists. I am only able to present some views from the biological side of the gulf on the construct that Barkow has erected in the middle of it. Not being familiar with all the relevant literature, I readily assume that Barkow's paper represents the gist of Hallowell's sociobiological ideas. I was somewhat surprised, however, to learn that Hallowell would have been a pioneer in stating, in 1949, that the evolution of human behavior and culture ought to be studied by anthropologists, e.g., by comparative prima- tology. Would this not have been suggested before him by pioneering evolutionists like Charles Darwin, Ernst Haeckel, Julian Huxley, or Bernard Rensch, or by a pioneering prima- tologist like Robert Yerkes? If Barkow is right, my surprise simply illustrates the well-established matter-of-factness of such an approach among present-day anthropologists. I have some more concrete questions about the section on cognitive mapping and the one that follows it. Barkow states here: "For the frog, that which is in motion is adaptively significant; given natural selection, the central nervous system of the frog is therefore designed to detect and record motion." I sense some circularity here. Would not the second part of the sentence better read: "the central nervous system of the frog is apparently able to detect and record motion"? I think the meaning of both parts of the sentence is really the same (I hope that not all biologists will blame Barkow for using the teleological anthropomorphism "designed for"). In analogy to the above adaptations, Barkow continues, the social ones of the primates gave rise to long-lasting internal representations of fellow troop members. I do not quite under- stand, however, why ground-dwelling would have been the prime motive for these adaptations: what about water-dwelling mammals like cetaceans and pinnipeds? And what about ground-dwelling mammals like the carnivores and the ele- phants? Are they not dependent for protection on their fellow troop members as well? Why did they not develop internal representation of their larger and dominant troop members similar to that evolved in our human ancestors? I do not quite follow how "in the course of our own evolution, we apparently became terrestrial. . . ." Was it only the emerg- ing species Homo sapiens that descended from the trees to the ground, and not the Miocene or Pliocene primates before it? When Barkow concludes, "Thus, during our evolution we were selected for the tendency to internalize our fellow troop mem- bers," I sense again some tautological reasoning, as this is his very hypothesis, however interesting it may be. He then suggests that "when we phenomenologically ex- perience self-awareness, the central nervous system is evaluating the state of the self and its relationship to external reality." Is this not one of the simpler definitions of self-consciousness? Barkow suspects animals like chimpanzees to be self-conscious. To be sure, this is an interesting suspicion, but its value is limited in the absence of a definition of such a condition; and Vol. 19 * No. 1 * March 1978 113</page><page sequence="16">in trying to give a definition one should be well aware of the pitfalls of anthropomorphic projections. I have some doubts whether the emergence of norms can simply be explained by ancestral hierarchies and "obeying mother in mother's absence." Again, I would like to know what, really, the differences are in these respects between man's ancestors and other mammals, especially the nonhuman primates. As long as this question remains unanswered, I am afraid that biologists and anthropologists cannot state much more than that the human behavior called ethical and the un- derlying common drives that are described phenomenologically as norms (i.e., for the time being gestalts rather than concrete neural phenomena) must be the result of the complicated fabric of ancestral social adaptations; and that the latter must have resulted from the-as yet largely unknown-special inter- action between ancestral genetic properties and ecological pressures that have shaped the species H. sapiens. Some indi- cations for the explanation of this interaction can be provided by primatology, social anthropology, paleoanthropology, and ethnology. I think that solving the question of the origin of norms should primarily be done by unraveling ancestral behavior determining group survival (Wind 1977); this must un- doubtedly have included the behavior modes adduced by Barkow. It is hard to imagine, however, that "the answer may lie in a heterogeneous environment," as this was certainly not the privilege of ancestral hominids: many other species must have shared this environment with them. Two final, more hairsplitting, remarks: (1) The statement "a tendency which would be selected for to the extent that it enhanced the internalizer's fitness" sounds like a truism to me. (2) In male adultery, the individual's loss of fitness can better be indicated by comparing the contributions of the individual concerned and of competing males to the gene pool than by "being discovered." In conclusion, I think that Hallowell and Barkow have indicated interesting and valuable avenues for progress in sociobiology, in which, however, a number of-mainly etho- logical and paleoanthropological-obstacles remain to be sur- mounted. Reply by JEROME H. BARKOW Montreal, Que., Canada. 23 x 77 The basic premiss of sociobiology is that many powerful selective pressures stem from competition among individuals to maximize their genetic representation in the gene pool: their inclusive fitness (Hamilton 1964). To the extent that individuals share genes, their evolutionary interests are the same and we expect the evolution of altruism. Even mother and infant do not share all their genes, however, so that, for ex- ample, there is a point at which having additional offspring would maximize the mother's inclusive fitness whereas con- tinuing to nurse would maximize that of the infant. At that point, selection favors mothers who try to wean and infants who try to prolong nursing (Trivers 1974). This sociobiological explanation of weaning conflict gives some idea of the power of the approach and will prove useful in the discussion of re- ductionism to follow.' If striving for inclusive fitness is one source of selective pressure, the environment is another. In principle, sociobiology 1 In this reply I will use the term "sociobiology" in its narrow sense, to refer to the body of theory summarized by Wilson (1975). I dis- cuss some of the ideas presented here at greater length elsewhere (Barkow 1978). is a predictive theory, provided that we know all the other major selective pressures on the species (e.g., predator pressure, competition from other species, etc.). The resulting morphology and behavior will be a sort of compromise or resultant among all selective pressures, regardless of their source. In practice, selective pressures tend to be so multifarious and their inter- actions so complex, particularly among the higher mammals, that sociobiology is generally applied after the fact (e.g., Hrdy 1976, Hrdy and Hrdy 1976; but see Sherman 1977 for a con- trary example). The behavior of a species is interpreted as being either consistent or inconsistent with sociobiological expectation; if inconsistent, it is generally assumed that selective pressures generated by the ecology cause the apparent aberration (Barkow 1978). Sociobiology is therefore an incomplete theory of phylo- genesis, incomplete in that selective pressures generated by adaptation to the environment are probably at least as powerful in determining the final morphology and behavior of a species as the pressures generated by competition among individuals striving to maximize inclusive fitness. Kurland, in dismissing attempts to reconstruct the selective pressures ecological adap- tation placed on early man as "science fiction," fails to appre- ciate this incompleteness. But sociobiology is a theory of phylogenesis, of biological evolution. Blurton-Jones (1976) laments that it tells us nothing about ontogenesis, that is, about the individual-level mechanisms throtigh which the selective pressures whose existence it predicts have actually been mediated. Such ontogenetic explanations would be at another level of explanation. The same behavior may be understood and explained at several levels of organization, a fact which Wilson (1975) and Dawkins (1976) understand but Irons and Kurland do not. For example, weaning conflict can be explained (as we have seen) at the evolutionary/sociobiological level. It can also be explained in terms of ontogenesis or developmental psychology (a la Freud, for example). Finally, we can have a theory of sociocultural evolution (or history) which explains why some societies wean at a given age and in a particular manner and others do not. Even for weaning, then, we need at least three different levels of explanation, each of which is linked to the others. "What is wrong with reductionism?" ask a number of com- mentators. Reductionism means claiming that a single level of explanation is entirely adequate and the others unnecessary or even "wrong." Any one of the three explanations of weaning provided above can be reductionistic if the need for other-level explanations is denied. Kurland, for example, appears to be a reductionist because he wishes to jump from sociobiology to culturally organized behavior without recognizing the equal requirement for explanations at the levels of the individual and of the culture. For Kurland and Irons, presumably, anthro- pologists should apply sociobiological concepts directly to sociocultural behavior (their incompleteness notwithstanding): if we find that a given cultural institution does indeed maximize the inclusive fitness of its participants and so is consistent with sociobiological prediction, our task of explanation is ended. But what of the other levels of explanation? What behavioral predispositions, at the level of the individual, cause him to act in this manner? (Perhaps we need the aid of a psychologist or ethologist here.) How is it that individuals with this behavioral predisposition (or whatever the mechanism mediating the selective pressure happens to be), in interacting over time, generate this particular sociocultural institution (Barkow 1973)? Here, we need a theory of sociocultural evolution which takes explicit account of an individual-level characteristic (the evolution of which can, in turn, be explained sociobiologically). Hallowell's ideas prevent reductionism because they provide us with a double bridge linking three levels of explanation. The normn-acquiring self is simultaneously a product of biological 114 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="17">Barkow: SOCIAL NORMS, THE SELF, AND SOCIOBIOLOGY evolution, with a locus at the level of the individual and with a much-studied ontogenesis, and culturally constituted. Admittedly, the strength of this conceptualization lies not in the ease with which it can be studied operationally-though there is a vast literature on the empirical study of the self-concept (e.g., Wylie 1974)-but in its integrative function. It spans all three levels of explanation, thereby "nobly" (as Kurland puts it) "saving" us from reductionism. I have myself used the concepts of self and norm to join Michael Chance's ideas of primate behavior and attention structure to some of the theories of G. H. Mead and Sigmund Freud (Barkow 1976a). Elsewhere, I have discussed how the concept of the self can enable us to link primate social dominance to human symbolically mediated prestige and even how it can help us understand social change in a modern West African city (Barkow 1975a, b). Are we to dismiss the concept of the self as "mentalistic," as Kurland and others would have us do, and so burn all bridges between sociobiologists and the many psychological and sociological researchers who make use of the concept? Is all theory not readily operationalizable to be instantly dismissed? Kurland and Irons are so busy lecturing me on the basics of sociobiology-of which they imagine I am wholly ignorant-that they fail to notice that this article is an effort of theoretical integration and bridge-building among levels of explanation. Elsewhere (1978) I provide a discussion and critique of sociobiology per se; here I am trying to relate sociobiology to past anthropological concerns with behavioral evolution and to show how it can be integrated into existing theories. I have much respect for the approach which Kurland and Irons represent and have myself essayed an empirical evaluation of certain aspects of sociobiology (Barkow n.d.b); but this approach is only one of several. Because Kurland and Irons are the only two sociobiologists who have commented on my article, their intolerance towards and dismissal of the work of others in human behavioral evolution is doubly dismaying. Indeed, Kurland is so certain that the study of human be- havioral evolution has just been invented that he begins by welcoming me into the field: my publications prior to the appearance of Wilson's (1975) Sociobiology apparently do not count. Irons tells us that the theories of Trivers and Hamilton are sufficient to explain norm acquisition and we have no need of other explanations. But these authors are not primarily con- cerned with the evolution of norms: they are dealing with a much more limited category of behavior, altruism. I have reinterpreted their theories to help explain a much broader information-pro&amp;essing capacity. Reciprocal altruism, for ex- ample, refers to a selective pressure for the ability to compute the probability that a contemplated act of altruism will even- tually be reciprocated and to perform that act only if the calculated probability reaches a certain level. This kind of selection was not taking place in a vacuum: we were under selective pressure for the entire set of traits which, taken together, constitute "cultural capacity." Being able to act in a reciprocally altruistic manner was probably mediated by complex cognitive abilities also being selected for by other pressures (discussed in the "science-fiction" literature referred to by Kurland, a partial bibliography of which will be found in the first section of Barkow 1978). The final emergent of all of these pressures was a kind of information-processing I conceptualize in terms of self and internalized social norms. Irons confuses the theories of selective pressure provided by Trivers and Hamilton with the theory linking selective pressure to mediating mechanism which I present. He thinks that leaving out the mediating mechanism altogether is "parsi- monious" rather than reductionistic. Of course, there may be more useful ways to conceptualize human information-processing capacity than self, cognitive map, and social norms-these are all just heuristic, hypothetical constructs, after all. In this I agree with Quiatt, wondering only what the additional concepts he predicts will be necessary will look like. Daly wants us to throw out the concept of self but, like Quiatt, suggests no substitute. Irons suggests we replace self and norm with a Barthian approach. This would involve doing away with the systematic analysis of behavior at the psychological level, substituting for it a sort of intuitive "pragmatism." Barth, for example, usually assumes that people are maximizing economic success, except when they obviously are not. Despite social anthropology's traditional horror of explicit psychological theorizing (as opposed to simplistic, wholly implicit motivational assumptions "bootlegged" into its theories), we still need a psychological anthropology (cf. Barkow 1973). I do agree with Irons, as I imagine Feldman would, that we also need a systems-type, generative approach to theory. Such theory can nevertheless include a concept of social norm without, as Irons imagines, necessarily implying an automaton theory of individual behavior (Barkow 1973, 1975a, 1976b). It would be impossible to reply at length to each of the other commentators, and I must apologize to those whose ideas I can discuss only briefly. I must at least thank Naylor for his perfect understanding of what I was trying to say and for his welcome tone of reasonableness and sanity. I also thank Pourchet, with whom I find myself much in agreement, and Hall. Paddock's essay demonstrates the intellectual stimulation which can come from dealing with Hallowell's ideas. Davis produces a valuable but far too brief discussion of some of the basic issues in understanding human behavioral evolution; I am largely in agreement with him and hope he will soon provide an article for CA expanding his remarks. Beals makes a useful correction of my comment involving cultural and protocultural adaptation to environment "without substantial genetic change." The point I was trying to make was that we can adapt to diverse ecologies without speciation, unlike, say, the baboon-macaque group. Mark presents a useful elaboration of my too-brief discussion of the nature of the self, for which I thank him. At times I suspect (or perhaps fear) that self-consciousness is an epiphe- nomenon resulting from selection for a particular kind of information-processing in which one aspect of a cognitive map of the organism is a representation of a limited number of its characteristics: limited because otherwise the self becomes a kind of homunculus, as Dawkins (1976) warns can occur. I note in passing that Kurland attributes Mark's position to me, so perhaps I was less clear about my view of the not necessarily causative role of self-awareness and conscious volition than I might have been. Lieberman's summary of Trivers's discussion of "grudgers" points out that we should not expect selection for unvarying conformity to norms: that is why I include a discussion of norm violation in the paper. I take issue with her on only one point (and rather reluctantly, given her gracious comments): I do not believe that I have entirely separated the two realms of evolution. The capacity to internalize norms is a product of biological evolution: the actual norms internalized are ordered by cultural evolution-different ecologies and different histories result in different norms. But it may be that, at the level of the individual, some culturally provided norms are learned more easily than others, presumably because they are closest to those norms which maximized inclusive fitness during our phylogenesis. I agree with Shafton's discussion of the evolution of self- awareness and regret that his work has not received some of the publicity the media have granted the "sociobiologists." And I am grateful to Welte for indicating some of the richness of Hal- Vol. 19 * No, 1 * March 1978 115</page><page sequence="18">lowell's thought.2 The human mind may well be more than the sum of the selective pressures which produced it. The philoso- pher may speak of the mind "transcending" itself, the systems theorist of "emergent properties": the meaning is the same. Wind's apt remarks point out the need for a far more elaborate and careful reconstruction of human behavioral evolution than the sketch I provide. Shafton's discussion, and his own work (1976), carry us in the needed direction. If such reconstructions must be based more on inference than on tangible evidence, as Feldman fears, there is nevertheless a powerful modus operandi: it consists of repeatedly asking of each potential explanation, "Why did not other species evolve along the same lines?" This approach, demonstrated by Wind, helps us avoid some of the teleology of which Feldman warns. The approach is also shared by Daly, who asks why other social carnivores do not have culture. One might ask the same question of our terrestrial primate cousins. Apparently, they were selected for the genetic assimilation of a single social adaptation, while we were selected for a great variety (Barkow n.d.a, b). I suggest that we evolved in a rapidly changing environment, while most groups of protohominids lived in more stable surroundings and were selected for (and therefore trapped in) a single social adaptation. But why should only our ancestors have had so rapidly changing an environment? I do not know. I fully agree with Wind that "a number of . . . ethological and paleo- anthropological obstacles remain to be surmounted" if we are to understand human behavioral evolution. Perhaps socio- biological concepts of maximization of inclusive fitness will here prove useful. I am not encouraging the current tendency to jump straight from pure sociobiological theory to "human nature," but am instead suggesting that we think about how inclusive-fitness selection pressures and those generated by the ecology might have interacted to produce our present constella- tion of species characteristics.
