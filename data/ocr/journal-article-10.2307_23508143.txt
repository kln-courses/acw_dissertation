<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Son of the Messiah : Ishmael Zevi and the Sabbatian Aqedah David J. Halperin University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill The early Sabbatian exegetical text preserved in MS Budapest, Kaufmann 255,1s a commentary on Sabbatai Zevi's distinctive liturgy for the midnight vigil (tiqqun hasot). The manuscript seems to be, as Gershom Scholem surmised, the writer's autograph. Irregularities in its handwriting may thus be used as indicators of the stages in which the author composed his work. Close examination of this text's allusions to Sabbatai Zevi's son Ishmael, who was regarded for a time as his father's Messianic successor, will provide a solution to the long-standing mystery of what became of the boy. (It will be shown that he died as a child.) The commentator's Messianic expectations for Ishmael Zevi, moreover, were bound up with his distinctive reading of the Aqedah story in Genesis, as well as with his perceptions of Islam. His fantasies about Ishmael Zevi thus reflect the powerful but ambiguous role of Islam in the imaginings of Sabbatai Zevi's followers. They pre sent us also with a remarkable "Aqedah of Ishmael"— Ishmael son of Hagar as well as Ishmael Zevi — which demands its place within the history of that ancient and pivotal motif of Jewish thought and experience that we call the Aqedah tradition. 1. Introduction And so they [Sabbatai Zevi and Sarah] were married.Yet he never made love to her until after he had set the pure turban on his head, and then she bore him a son and a daughter. But all this we shall relate presendy, with God's help. _ , 1ז " — Baruch ol Arezzo, Memorial to the Children of Israel One of the more intriguing mysteries of the early Sabbatian movement sur rounds the young son of the would-be Messiah. Ishmael Zevi was born in 1667 or 1668, within two years after his father had converted to Islam ("set the pure turban on his head"). He was raised, at least nominally, as a Muslim. After Sab batai's death in 1676, Ishmael became a focus for the Messianic expectations of some at least of Sabbatai's followers, and was elevated to a near-divine ( 1 ) Aharon Freimann, cInyanei Shabbetay Sevi: Sammelbund kleiner Schriften uberSabbatai Zebi und dessen Anhànger ( Berlin, 1912), p. 46. 143</page><page sequence="2">144 DAVID J. HALPE RI N [2] status equal to his father's. Yet, apart from a few obscure allusions, he disap pears entirely from the historical record after about 1680.Why? DônmeDônme tradition claims that Ishmael died at age six. Taken literally, this is impossible. All now agree, for reasons we will presendy see to be compelling, that Ishmael survived his father. Yet his disappearance from the subsequent history of Sabbatianism has suggested to most historians that the tradition is essentially correct, that he indeed died an early death. Gershom Scholem pointed out that he played no role whatever in the sectarian developments that followed the great apostasy at Salonika in 1683, and inferred from this that he was dead by then. An allusion to Ishmael in a text written in 1681 ,which Scholem interpreted to mean that he was still alive, allowed Scholem to fix his death between 1681 and 1683. But, when Meir Benayahu established that an other allusion to Ishmael must be dated to 1688 or 1689, Scholem confessed himself baffled.2 And Benayahu went on to propound a marvellously inge nious hypothesis according to which Ishmael Zevi did not die in childhood after all. Rather, he returned to Judaism in the 1680s, changed his name in symbolically appropriate fashion to'Tsaac Zevi,"and is to be identified with the man of that name who served as rabbi of Sarajevo from about 1690 onward? This article is a study of the figure of Ishmael Zevi, as he appears in an early Sabbatian text which Scholem designated "Commentary on Psalms"(perush mizmoreimizmorei tehillim)and attributed to one Israel Hazzan.In it, I undertake to re solve the mystery of Ishmael Zevi's disappearance. Scholem was right : Ishmael indeed died as a child,although a fewyears earlier than Scholem believed.The "Commentary on Psalms," which Scholem recognized as a particularly rich source for the millenarian expectations that developed around the boy, must be understood as also bearing silent witness to his death and to the impact that event had on the writer's Messianic faith. To establish that this is so,we must subject the text, and its allusions to Ishmael Zevi, to a closer analysis than it has so far received. Will we know more, when we are finished, about Ishmael Zevi as a human being? Hardly. This unfortunate child is barely allowed to exist — in our (2) Scholem,"Perush mizmorei tehillim mi-hugo shel Shabbetai Sevi be-Adrinopol," in Alei Ayin:Ayin:Ayin: The Salman Schocken Jubilee Volume. . .

We have access only to these fan tasies.tasies. We can infer much from them about the needs that brought them into being, litde about the person onto whom they were projected. Three motifs will emerge from our study. The first is the familiar and mel ancholy theme of Messianic expectation battered by repeated disappoint ment, transforming itself again and again, but without ever being able to free itself of its fundamental addiction to illusion. The second is the powerful but ambiguous role of Islam in the imaginings of the Sabbatians, who, on this subject, perhaps expressed more or less openly feelings that were latent in many other Jews of their time. The third is the Aqedah, as envisioned by at least one Sabbatian exegete. Its victim-hero is now an Ishmael instead of — or, as well as — an Isaac. Un like his Biblical prototype, he indeed perishes in his childhood, and is speed ily forgotten by those who once venerated him. The story of Ishmael Zevi, as it emerges from the early Sabbatian sources, thus takes its place within the an cient and perdurable tradition that marks one of the central themes of Jewish religious thought and experience. The significance of the Aqedah theme — for Judaism, for religion, for the entire human experience — has been the subject of much weighty médita tion 'tion ' In such meditations, the Aqedah of Ishmael Zevi deserves to be taken into account. No less than the other, more conventional, manifestations of the Aqedah tradition, it has its role to play in evoking and defining the mean ing of the whole. Our procedure will be as follows : We will begin by examining the evidence for Ishmael Zevi's life,down to 1680, provided by sources other than the"Com mentary on Psalms'.'We will then turn to the commentary itself and consider its structure and purpose — we will see in this connection that Scholem's title is not altogether appropriate — and establish how the author's plan for his work changed in the course of writing. These changes of plan, as we will see, are closely linked to his expectations concerning Ishmael Zevi, and to the frustration of these expectations. As we proceed, the author's perceptions of Islam and of the Aqedah will (4) Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling is of course the classic.

HALPF.RIN [4] come into our view, and will become so tightly bound up with his fantasy fig ure of Ishmael Zevi that we will need to consider all of them together. This part of the argument will oblige us to undertake a particularly close analysis of the commentary's Aqedah exegesis. I will then examine certain data that seem to contradict my view that Ish mael Zevi was dead by 1680, and will offer alternative explanations for those data. We will consider what became of the Messianic faith of the author of the "Psalms Commentary,"once its focus was gone. And we will take a last look at the figure who stands at the center of the Sabbatian Aqedah, and reflect on what it means to be hero and victim of so dreadful and pathetic a drama. 2.The Life of Ishmael Zevi Our data about Ishmael Zevi are sparse and uncertain. Earlier historians of Sabbatianism — Scholem, Benayahu, Yehuda Liebes — have gathered and discussed the key testimonies? Let us examine them once again. The earliest surviving hagiography of Sabbatai Zevi, written in the 1680s by one Baruch of Arezzof claims that he first made love with his wife Sarah af ter his conversion to Islam' and that "she bore him a son. He himself circum cised him on the eighth day, reciting aloud the blessings over the wine in full view of the Turks. He named him Ishmael Mordecai. Afterwards she bore a daughter, and he called her name"— and, where the daughter's name ought to be, the text is unaccountably blank.8 Baruch's account of "Ishmael Mordecai's"circumcision, which is obviously intended to show that the rite took place according to Jewish rather than Mus lim practice, is contradicted by the more reliable contemporary narrative of Jacob Najara? Ishmael was circumcised, according to this account, in Adri (5) Above, sec. 1, nn. 2-3 ; Scho\em,Sabbata1 Sevi: The Mystical Messiah (Princeton, 1973), index, s.v."Sevi, Ishmael Mordecai"; Liebes,"Yahaso shel Shabbetai Sevi le-hamarat dato" Sefunot n.s. 22 (1983) 273-74; reprintedin On Sabbateaismandits Kabbalah: CollectedEssays( Hebrew; Jerusalem, "995)&gt;PP-277-78• (6) Zikkaron livnei Yisra'el, published in Freimann,cInyanei Shabbetay Sevi, pp. 43-78.

(He remarried her not long after ward.)10The boy was now three years old, Sabbatai remarked to Najara, and therefore must be circumcised in accord with Leviticus 19:23-24, three years shall shall it be uncircumcised to you.. . but in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holiness of praise.of praise. Sabbatai found it significant that he had gained custody of the child on 7 Nisan,the day when Elishama prince of the tribe of Ephraim had made his offering to the tabernacle (Numbers 7:48-53) ; Elishama's name being an anagram for"Ishmael"and his status an allusion to the Messiah ben Ephraim. Ishmael was given the Jewish name" Israel" for the occasion.11 It is evident from Najara's account that this eccentric ritual was carried out amid considerable Messianic excitement. We can only imagine its effect on the three-year-old child, snatched from his mother and hustled off to a gath ering of enthusiasts who pronounced over him prophecies and blessings un intelligible to him, while they cut his penis.12 It will follow from Najara's chronology that Ishmael was born in Nisan 1668. This date entirely suits Baruch of Arezzo's story.13 There is, however, an important piece of evidence that can be taken to suggest he was born the previ ous year.14This is a letter written by Nathan of Gaza to Sabbatai Zevi's broth ers, evidendy early in 1667, which prophesies that "out of this business [the summarized in Scholem, Sabbatai Seui, pp. 846-51.

( 12 ) We may get some idea of the trauma inflicted by reading accounts of the circumcisions, in traditional societies, of older boys who have the advantage of being prepared for the opera tion and knowing why they are being made to endure it : Clifford Geertz, The Religion of Java, Chicago &amp; London, i960, pp. 51-53; Nelson Mandela, Long Walk to Freedom : The Autobiography of Nelson Nelson Mandela, Boston ,1994, pp. 2 2 -2 7. ( I owe the latter reference to my colleague Professor Ya akov Ariel.) It is not clear from Najara's account how many people attended the circumcision. On 8 Nisan, he says, Sabbatai sent invitations to the Muslim notables of Adrianople, knowing that they would falsely assume that the ritual was scheduled for the next day. (Clearly, pace Ba ruch of Arezzo, Sabbatai was concerned that the Muslims not know just what was done at the circumcision.) Najara himself performed the circumcision — again contradicting Baruch of Arezzo — and Joseph Karillo acted as sandaq. But there were clearly other Jews,or at least Jew ish apostates, present. One of them"had a ten-year-old son who had not yet been circumcised; he had vowed, while Ami rah was in the'tower of strength' [that is, when Sabbatai Zevi was being held in the fortress Gallipoli,in 1666],to circumcise him only in the presence of King Messiah. Amirah then commanded the afore-mentioned rabbi [Najara] that he circumcise him with the afore-mentioned blessings, and he called his name Ishmaeir ( 13) The Dônme tradition similarly recalls that Ishmael was circumcised at age three : Moshe Attias and Gershom Scholem, Shirot ve-tushbahot shel ha-shabbeta'im (Tel Aviv, 1947), p.46.

Of him the Bible says ,Only let Ishmael live before you [Genesis 17:18], and and he will be a wild ass of a man,his hand in all and the hand of all in him [16:12 ![' inasmuch as by his hand shall the Gentiles be sustained and preserved from annihilation, [God] not wishing the destruction of any creaturer16It sounds very much as if Ishmael's birth is imminent. We need not assume, however, that the child Nathan anticipates is necessarily the same as the one who was actually born and given the name Ishmael. The expecting mother — who may or may not have been Sarah17— may have miscarried; the child may have died in infancy; it may have turned out to be a girl. Sabbatai's first son will then have been born the following spring. Nathan's allusions to the Biblical Ishmael (to which we should add Gen 17:25, according to which Ishmael was circumcised at age thirteen) are ech oed in a letter that Sabbatai himself wrote some months after his birth!8 The day of th epidyon ha-ben of "my first-born son Ishmael, who shall be great [Gen 17:20] and shall /we [17:18]['is said to have taken place in the week of the To rah portion containing Lev 25:26, Should a man have no redeemer, his hand shall yet yet attain that hefind the wherewithal for his redemption]'3 "Surely this is an allusion tojob, the man of sufferings who well knows illness [Isaiah 53:3] — I will concede to (15) Translated in accord with Nathan's evident understanding of the passage. (16) Quoted byjacob Sasportas, Sisat navel Sew ; Isaiah Tishby (ed.) (Jerusalem, 1954),pp. 200-01. ( 17) Sasportas, writing to the Moroccan rabbis in the fall of 1668, speaks of Ishmael as the off spring of a Muslim wife or concubine of Sabbatai's (Sisat novel Sevi, p.314; also p. 349, written in August 1669; cf. Scholem, Sabbatai Sevi, p.685). How seriously ought we to take this claim? Sas portas was hardly an unbiased observer, and the Genesis typology invoked by Nathan might well have suggested to him that, like his Biblical model, Ishmael Zevi was the son of a concubine. Na jara, moreover, explicitly represents Sarah as Ishmael Zevi's mother. But it is curious that,sev eral years later, Sabbatai refers to Ishmael as the son of his new wife, Joseph Filosoff's daughter (see below). If Ishmael was in fact the son of a non-Jewish woman — who would have been, from the Jewish perspective, no wife at all — we can easily imagine that Sabbatai and his followers might have adopted the convention of describing him as the "son" of whoever Sabbatai's current Jewish wife happened to be. A Dônme hymn speaks obscurely of Sabbatai having had "three other women" in addition to his four "official" wives, and says immediately afterward,"Ishmael came forth from him" (Attias and Scholem, Shirot ve-tushbahot, p. 205 ).All of this suggests the possi bilitybility that Ishmael's mother — and, if my reconstruction is correct, the woman whom Nathan falsely expected to become Ishmael's mother — may have been someone other than Sarah. Cf. Sisat Sisat novel Sevi, p. 327, where the Moroccan rabbi Ibn Sa'adun, writing to Sasportas at some time in 542g (1668-69), seems disposed to deny the authenticity of Nathan's prophecy of Ishmael's birth, as though there were something discreditable about it.

Through this fog of Biblical allusions, we can discern that Sabbatai(who regularly identified himself with the suffering Job)20expects the first-born son whom he has recently "re deemed"to be his"right hand','and to turn out to be his own redeemer. The sources quoted so far permit the speculation that Sabbatai and his fol lowers saw Ishmael as embodying in his small person the duality of Sabbatai's new life as simultaneously Muslim and Jew; and, through his very existence, as rescuing him and his followers from this insoluble contradiction. His names, as recorded by Baruch of Arezzo, may be understood as symbolizing and defining his intended role. As"Mordecai," he is the Jew placed more or less against his will at the center of Gentile power ;21while, as "Ishmael," he is the collective representation of that power. It is the tip of Ishmael's penis, above all else, that bears this fantastic burden. The Sabbatians,it seems,could hardly mention him without talking about his circumcision22circumcision22 which functions to unite Judaism and Islam in his person,but also to symbolize the choice that must be made between the two (since you cannot be circumcised as an infant of eight days and again as a young boy). Nathan finds an ingenious way to escape this choice : like Moses in the mid rash, Ishmael will be born circumcised.23 In this respect, as in others, Ishmael Zevi disappointed his elders. At the beginning of 1673, Sabbatai Zevi was banished to Dulcigno in Albania. Sarah and Ishmael went into exile with him; we shall presently see that a re markable vignette has been preserved of their life together.

Several months before his death, he wrote a letter to Filosoff in which he promises to visit him in the company of his wife,"and, with her, her two sons Ishmael and Abraham'.'25 Let us leave aside the mysterious "Abraham"; let us leave aside, also, the problem of why Sabbatai should have called Ishmael the son of his new wife.26 Benayahu's interpretation of the letter, that Sabbatai was bringing his sons to Salonika to pursue their education with Filosoff, is thoroughly plausible.27 On Yom Kippur, 1676, Sabbatai died. His brother, Elijah Zevi,escorted the widow and children back to Adrianople ; we learn this from a letter of Samuel Gandoor, as quoted in a subsequent letter of Meir Rofe to Abraham Rovigo ( 2 5 October 1677)?8The widow apparently returned at some later point to Sa lonika, and Benayahu thinks it a fair assumption that Ishmael went with her. But there is no evidence for this. The widow seems still to have been in Adrianople in 1681. Abraham Car dozo reports her to have travelled from there to Rodosto at the end of that year, seeking his hand in marriage. So, she told him, her late husband had di rected her; and the impending Messianic redemption would depend upon their union. Cardozo urged her to wait until after the redemption, which he had predicted for Passover 1682,had taken place; whereupon she went back to Adrianople.29 Ishmael Zevi is wholly absent from this narrative. Cardozo mentions, as did Gandoor, that after Sabbatai's death Elijah Zevi "went to bring the widow to Adrianople'.' But unlike Gandoor he says nothing of any children having been present. Why the silence about Ishmael? We must admit that Cardozo was writing some twenty years after the events, and that he might well have neglected to mention any but the most important participants. Yet, given the intense Mes sianic hopes that we shall see to have been attached to Ishmael not long raentary on Psalms" (below, sec. 6) is Sabbatai's wife Sarah, and not the daughter of Aaron Majar, whom Sabbatai had planned to marry in 1671 and again in 1674 (and whose name was also Sarah).

(Not long afterward, she turned her attentions to her young brother Jacob Querido, who would prove a more satisfactory Messianic partner than either Ishmael or Cardozo.)30 We must defer to section 9 our examination of two important post-1680 ref erences to Ishmael Zevi.by Abraham Yakhini and Abraham Cuenque ; and, to an excursus, Benayahu's brilliant (but, in my opinion, mistaken) reconstruc tion of Ishmael's long and successful post-Sabbatian career. For now, let us conclude this section with a slightly earlier bit of evidence : a Sabbatian text dealing with the Messianic role of Mordecai Eisenstadt, written evidendy in 1679, which explains the necessity for Sabbatai Zevi and his offspring to be "profaned among the Gentiles. He needed to mend [letaqqen\ that filth Ish mael that had emerged from Abraham ; that was why he needed to beget the son called Ishmael. . . . Ishmael's [that is, Islam's] merit extended only to the year 5436 [1675-76, at the end of which Sabbatai Zevi died], [after which] they deserved to be wholly annihilated. That was why he produced that son and called his name Ishmael, in order to mix with them and, by Abraham's merit, preserve that [Muslim] nation from annihilation!'31 This testimony rounds off the scanty data about Ishmael Zevi that we have already examined. He was born (probably) in Nisan 1668,ayear and a half af ter his father's conversion to Islam, and given a name that encapsulated the Islamic world as seen through Jewish eyes. He was brought up nominally as a Muslim, and was still so regarded in 1679. Sabbatai saw him as his own future redeemer, and (at least by 1671) as the Messiah ben Ephraim. He was expected to emerge circumcised from the womb; that anticipation having failed, he was abruptly made to undergo circumcision at age three. When he was four, he was exiled with his parents to remote Albania. The woman he regarded as his mother died when he was five or six. His father died when he was eight. He seems still to be alive, still to be a Muslim, at age ten or eleven (1679).The letter of Nathan of Gaza, written before his birth, hints that great things were (3&lt;נ) Ibid., pp. 84-101 ; Scholem,"The Crypto-Jewish Sect of the Dônmeh (Sabbatians) in Tur key," in The Messianic Idea in Judaism (New York, 1971), pp. 147-55• (31) Scholem,"Peraqim apoqaliptiyyimrin Liebes,Researches in Sabbateanism,pp. 545-46; cf.

Yet,not long after that birthday, he seems to have vanished from the Sabbatian collective memory. With this background, let us turn to examine the source that most vividly expresses the greatness expected of the Messiah's small son, and that sheds the most light on his mysterious slide into oblivion. 3. MS Budapest, Kaufmann 255: A Commentary on the Sabbatian Liturgy for the Midnight Vigil In 1940, Gershom Scholem discovered in the David Kaufmann collection (Budapest) a hitherto unknown Sabbatian text. It was a commentary on what seemed to be a random assortment of Biblical Psalms, with a few other pas sages mixed in, e.g., the story of the manna in Exodus 16, the Ten Command ments,ments, the Aqedah. Scholem published a detailed article on the text some ten years later, and printed a few extracts from it in an appendix.32 To my knowl edge, it has not otherwise been published ; nor have further manuscripts of it come to light; nor has it been subjected to independent study, scholars nor mally having been content to quote or cite it via Scholem's article. I am grate ful to the Library of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (and particularly to Dr. Istvan Ormos, Keeper of the Kaufmann Collection) for having supplied me with a set of excellent photographic prints of the manuscript. Scholem found it easy enough to fix the approximate date when the text was composed. Almost from its beginning, it presupposes Sabbatai Zevi's death (discreetly called his "disappearance" ),and represents it as a problem for the faithful?3 On the other hand, it repeatedly refers to Nathan of Gaza as one who is still alive. It follows that the text must have been written after Sab batai's death had become widely known, and before the author might be ex pected to have learned of Nathan's. It cannot be earlier than 1677,or later than 1680?4 The author was a loyal disciple and scribe of Nathan's, and it appears from one story he tells (below) that he lived at least for a time in Nathan's sometime headquarters of Kastoria in Macedonia. These data, combined with a strong hint in the text that his name was"Israel"(see below, n.52),encouraged Scho lem to identify him with one'Tsrael Hazzan of Kastoria"mentioned by the Ital ian Sabbatian Benjamin Kohen. Scholars have followed Scholem's lead,and (32) See above,sec. i,n. 2. (33) E.g., fol 16v("they do not budge from their faith. . . even after the disappearance [he-[he c&amp;m]"),20r ("the great objection that our opponents raise to us . . .'he is dead and buried, what more can you hope from him?'"). (34) Meir Rofe's letters to Abraham Rovigo show that Sabbatai's followers were kept in the dark about his death until well into 1677; SchoXem,Sahbatai .S'««,pp.918-19.</page><page sequence="11">[11] THE SON OF THE MESSIAH I53 it will be convenient for us to speak of the author as"Israel Hazzan!' This iden tification,tification, however, does not contribute a great deal to our knowledge of the writer. We have no other information on Israel Hazzan at this period of his life; although Meir Benayahu and David Tamar have called attention to legal texts that suggest that from 1692 onward he was treated by the Jewish com munity of Kastoria as a respectable and indeed a leading citizen, and that he was still alive in 1720?5 If Israel Hazzan was the author of our text, therefore, he must have been a fairly young man at the time. Now, Hazzan's commentary has a great deal to say about Ishmael Zevi and about his Messianic role. Scholem excerpts some of the relevant statements, and puts them in the context of what we know about Ishmael's life. He does not, however, attempt to evaluate them within the context of the commen tary itself, or to trace the development of Hazzan's perceptions of Ishmael as an aspect of the evolution of his overall project. This seems to me a crucial omission. For it must be understood that the statements about Ishmael are by no means evenly distributed through the commentary. On the contrary, Ish mael first makes his appearance more than two-thirds of the way through the text, dominates much of the next eleven folio pages, and then disappears as suddenly as he came, never to be heard of again. If we are to make sense of this curious proceeding — which will be essential, if we are to understand what Ishmael Zevi meant to Israel Hazzan — it will behoove us to take a closer look at the structure and development of Hazzan's composition. To this end, I will proceed to establish at least the probability of three as sertions. First, Scholem was mistaken to believe that Hazzan selected his Bib lical texts without any predetermined plan, guided only by his inspiration at each juncture. The sequence of texts Hazzan expounds is in fact based on the distinctive liturgy for the midnight vigil (tiqqun hasot)that Sabbatai Zevi formulated no later than 1665.Where Hazzan diverges from the original se quence — as he does, in significant ways — we must seek some particular mo tivation on his part. Second, Scholem was right to suspect that MS Kaufmann 2 55 is Hazzan's autograph.Third, the enormous variations in the manuscript's handwriting, to which Scholem called attention, may be used as markers of the stages in which the commentary was composed, and the points at which the author quite literally laid down his pen. The bearing of these assertions on our examination of Ishmael Zevi will presently become clear. In his widely circulated letter to Raphael Joseph (September 1665),Nathan of Gaza admonished that"the meditations (kawwanoth) which the great master (35) Benayahu, Shabbatean Movement in Greece, pp. 241-43,24511; Tamar, Mehqarim be-toledot ha-Yehudimha-Yehudim be-eres Yisrael u-ve-arsot ha-mizrah (Jerusalem, 1981), cited by Liebes, Researches in Sab batianism, p. 139.1 have not seen Tamar's book.</page><page sequence="12">154 DAVID J.

The purpose of the rite was to raise the divine Female(the Shechinah)from her dust and to cou pie her with the divine Male ;37and, according to Nathan, the Shechinah had by 1665 already begun her ascent."Hence,"he wrote in 1666,"one must not perform the tiqqun and weep over the exile of the Shechinah as we used to do, but the tiqqun that Am i rah38ordained, as it is well known to you!'39 What was"the tiqqun that Amirah ordained"? Scholem writes, in a foot note to this passage, that it is no longer extant. He does not seem to have ob served that it is set forth in detail by the eighteenth-century Salonikan rabbi and preacher Abraham Miranda, in the course of a discussion of the con temporary relevance of the Lurianic kavvanot.4° These kavvanot, says Miranda (echoing Nathan) are by and large obsolete, and the Lurianic tiqqun hasot is no longer suitable."But one should recite the following tiqqun, preferably while standing ;41and should begin by reciting with a melodious voice, clear enunciation, and a sacred melody: For the sake of of the unity of the Blessed Holy One, etc. Our God and God of our fathers, reign over the the entire world in your glory, etc" There follows a list of Biblical passages to be recited(see below),concluded by the statement:"Thus ends the tiqqun hasot arranged by Am i ra h."

The order of readings is identical in all sources. On the essential content of the Sabbatian liturgy for tiqqun hasot, in other words, Miranda and the 1666 editions are in complete agreement. This liturgy turns out to be a very much expanded version of the Lurianic "rite of Leah" {tiqqun le'ah).The Lurianic tiqqun hasot had been divided into a"rite of RacheT'and a"rite of Leah!' In this division,"RacheP'represents that aspect of the divine Female that has been exiled and degraded(and therefore requires rescue),"Leah" the aspect that is about to engage in the sacred cou pling with the Male (and therefore requires preparation and assistance).46 of the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, the fourth by the Princeton University Library, The Hebrew Union College editions are those printed l."at the press and behest of David de Castro Tartaz,"Amsterdam (Scholem's no. 30), 2."at the behest of. . .Joshua Sarphati at the press of David de Castro Tartaz,"Amsterdam (Scholem's no. 31), 3.

It includes no fewer than six title pages, one of them in Spanish (Scholem's no. 34, Plate IV), another corresponding to the frontispiece de scribed by Scholem (and reproduced by him as Plate III). The first two title pages both claim that the book was published in Amsterdam,"at the press and behest of David de Castro Tartaz"; the second corresponds to Scholem's no. 30, the first is similar to nos. 31 and 32 but identical with neither.

From this and from other remarks in Shacar ha-kavvanot, it is clear that the"Leah"liturgy was structured with an eye toward the Zoharic myth of the hind,in which the Female's nocturnal excursion con veys divine effluence ("food") to those below(Zohar,II,52b,219b-2 20a,III,24ga-b; the last two passages are translated in Isaiah Tishby, The Wisdom oftheZohar[ London and Washington,1989], vol.1, pp. 393-96, vol. 2, pp. 738-40).It is thus no accident that Israel Hazzan's commentary on his opening psalm (42)is largely given over to detailed exposition of these Zoharic passages. (47) Scholem,"Hadashot cal Rabbi David Yishaqi ha-shabbeta'i,"in Liebes,Researches in Sab bateanism,bateanism, pp. 197-202. (48) Moses Zacuto, for example,could never bring himself to accept Nathan's theory that the Lurianic kawanot were outdated. Yet, temporarily persuaded that an era of divine grace was dawning, he decided in 1666 no longer to perform tiqqun hasot "with lamentations and sitting on the ground,as I once did. ... I recite at midnight the Psalm of Asaph [Psalm 79],the verses Look Look from heaven. . .

Sab bataibatai Sevi, pp. 501-04).We will presently see that one of these remnants, Isa 63:15-18, was sub stantially to influence the thought of Israel Hazzan.

Where two passages appear on the same line, this indicates that Hazzan has wandered into an exposition of the second within the frame work of his commentary on the first. Where Ishmael Zevi appears in the com mentary to a given passage, I have noted this fact in parentheses. Four passages in my list are in brackets. Hazzan does not actually expound (50) That is,the liturgical poem beginning le-macanekha ve-lo lanu u-le-shokhevei mecarah (David son son, Thesaurus, vol .3, p.54 ),which Hazzan(fol 47V) represents as having been afavorite of Sabbatai Zevi's, and which he expounds as though it were one of his Biblical texts. (Is there any signifi cance to the fact that two of the sources Davidson gives for the poem are nineteenth-century editions of tiqqun hasot ?)

HALPERIN [16] these texts, but only notes that either he or Nathan of Gaza has elsewhere com mented on them?2 Remarks of this sort are wholly inexplicable unless we as sume that Hazzan was working with a fixed lectionary sequence that included these passages. He might add commentary on passages that did not figure in the liturgy, but he did not want to omit comment on any part of the liturgy without explaining the omission. It seems to me entirely clear that Israel Hazzan had set himself to write a commentary on the Sabbatian tiqqun hasot. It is also clear that he permitted himself significant liberties with his source. We might account for the addi tion of one or two Biblical passages here and there — Psalms 88 and 77 after Psalm28,Psalms46and47aftertheTen Commandments — as deriving from a variant text of the tiqqun. But it is very unlikely that this will explain the dis placement of the entire series of passages from Psalm 34 through the Aqe dah to after Proverbs 31; or the introduction of a wholly new series of pas sages, which have no counterparts in the tiqqun, after the Aqedah. Only one hypothesis will seem to me to make sense of these rearrange ments. At some point prior to undertaking the exposition of Psalm 34, Israel Hazzan conceived the idea of making the Aqedah, and his interpretation of it, the climax of his composition. His commentaries on the sequence of lections preceding the Aqedah were to lead up to this climax. He therefore saved this sequence for last and skipped over it for the time being, going straight from Psalm 2 8 to the manna story. All of the commentary's allusions to Ishmael Zevi occur within, within, and dominate, this displaced sequence. But something went wrong. At some point — and we shall presently seek to define that point — Hazzan realized that the Aqedah was not so fitting a conclusion after all. He therefore continued his composition beyond the bounds he had originally set for it, to cover what appears to be some other liturgical sequence that I have not yet been able to identify ;53and he ended (52) Hazzan notes on fol g8v that theyihudim of Psalms 40 and 63 have been explained by Na than "in the book of his holy writings that I copied from his holy exalted mouth;'fols 4V and 2r respectively; while he has himself expounded Psalm 111 in his Emunei Yisrael, page 49. Fol 114V refers the reader to"page 85"for an interpretation of 1 Sam 2:1-10; I assume that this reference is also to the otherwise unknown Emunei Yisrael, since it does not correspond to our manuscript. The very low folio numbers of the lost "book"of Nathan's utterances (cf. Scholem,"Perush miz morei tehillim','p. 160 and n. 6; Liebes, p. 92) tempts me to suspect that this"book"may have con sisted of what were originally the first six folios of MS Kaufmann 255; which, as we now have it, begins with fol ךr (see below). But six folio pages seems very short for a"book"(se/er). (53) Hazzan's cross-reference to his exposition of 1 Sam 2:1-10 (above, n.52) shows that he is working with some pre-existing sequence of texts, and not following his own inspiration .This se quence bears no resemblance whatever to the Sabbatian tiqqun ha-yom, the liturgy to be recited after the morning service, as this is represented in the 1666 editions. (The tiqqun ha-yom lec tionsare Gen 1:1-2:3,Deut 5:6-18,32:1-43, the first two parashiyyot of Lev [1:1-7:38], Isa 2:1-5,</page><page sequence="17">[17] THE SON OF THE MESSIAH 159 on the melancholy strains of the Ninetieth Psalm?4 Scholem,Scholem, as I have already remarked, was inclined to think that MS Kauf mann 255 is Israel Hazzan's autograph. Its script, he says, is seventeenth century Sephardic,written"by a single scribe whose handwriting transforms itself on many pages from a precise and exacting script to one that is so rapid and careless that they look like two different scripts." He attributed these sudden changes to "the writer's level of weariness and concentration. It is very possible that the scribe was himself the author, and the manner in which corrections are made in a number of places will support this view."55 Scholem gave no examples to back up his last assertion. Let me provide one. On fol tigr-v Hazzan gives an interpretation, inspired by Nathan of Gaza's writings, of the words boded cal gag in Ps 102:8. Its essential point is that Sab batai Zevi has fused the two dalets of boded into the final closed mem, and thus closed off the structures of holiness against the profaning and destructive forces of chaos. Having made this point about verse 8, Hazzan proceeds to verse 9 : "Let us return to our passage. The text goes on, All day long have they mocked mocked me" But he puts two dots — evidently a mark of erasure — over each of the last five words (amar cod kol ha-yom herfuni ), and continues," We may also understand in this way another Biblical text, spoken by Micah with regard to 11:1-12:5,Jer 30:1-31:39■ 33:10-26, Prov 31:10-31.) Is it perhaps linked to the liturgies of the shomerimshomerim la-boqer groups, who since the 1570s had made it their practice to gather before dawn for voluntary prayer rituals? (See Elliott Horowitz,"Coffee, Coffeehouses, and the Nocturnal Rituals of Early Modern Jewry,"/t/.S Review 14(3989] 17-46.) The fact that it begins with Job 28:3 ,He has put put an end to darkness, might conceivably point in this direction. But I have so far been unable to consult any edition of these liturgies ( e.g., Aaron Berechiah of Modena's Ashmoret ha-boqer), and must for the present leave this as speculation. (54) I see no reason to suspect, as Scholem does, that any pages have been lost at the end of the manuscript.The last page is in poor condition, but it carries the commentary to the very end of Psalm go, and ends amen ve-amen. ( It is not true that this page"was damaged by cutting," as Scholem claims.The even lines that appear to mutilate the last page, which do indeed give the impression of having been made by knife or scissors, are in fact the edges of tape used to bind, rather ineptly, the tattered sheet into the volume. The same is true of other pages of the manu script, which seemed to Scholem to have been cut so that "a few of the letters are missing"; the letters were covered with tape, and can often be dimly made out.) Nor would there be any rea son to suppose that the beginning of the text is missing, were it not for the odd fact that the He brew numeration of the folio pages begins at 7. (It ends at 136 — not 137, as Scholem says.) In n. 52, above, I offered one possible explanation for this peculiarity, but I do not have much confi dence in it. In citing the manuscript, I follow the Hebrew page numbers (which, of course, I write using Arabic numerals).There is also a sequence of Arabic numerals written on the pages (be ginning with folio 1, ending with 128), but it is useless : the same number is occasionally used for two different pages, and the sequence gives rise to a horrendous bit of confusion about two thirds of the way through the manuscript, where a cluster of twelve folios is bound into the vol ume upside-down so that the last page comes first. In preparing this article, I have ignored it. (55) "Perush mizmorei tehillim',' p. 158 ; Liebes, p. 90.</page><page sequence="18">160 DAV I D J. HALPE RI N [18] the true Messiah, namely Ami rah." The text in question is Mic 7:14, where the two dalets of le-vadad may similarly be explained in accord with Nathan's theory of the closed mem. Hazzan spends about five lines discussing this pas sage. He then resumes his quotation of Ps 102:9&gt;kol ha-yom ve-khu, and goes on to explicate it. It is difficult to imagine a scribal error, or series of scribal errors, that would have created this text. Assume that the manuscript is Hazzan's autograph, and all is clear. Hazzan, having applied Nathan's theory to Ps 102:8, proceeded to the next verse. Immediately after writing the lemma, however, it occurred to him that the theory will shed fresh light also on Mic 7:14. He left his writing for a time, presumably while he thought this through.(The script becomes slightly smaller and neater after the words amar cod kol ha-yom herfuni, as it tends to after the writer has taken a break; see below.) Returning to his desk, he made his point about the Micah passage, then resumed, in the most con cise manner possible, his interrupted discussion of Ps 102:9. A scribe, copying a text that originated in the way I have suggested, would surely either have deleted the words amar cod kol ha-yom herfuni or else omit ted to mark them for erasure. The text as we have it best makes sense if we suppose it comes straight from its author's hand. This assumption will allow us our best explanation of a peculiar feature of the manuscript. Of the forty-four units of content into which the text can be divided (above),no fewer than fifteen — that is, slightly over one-third of the total — begin at the very top of the page (more often a verso than a recto)?6 This tendency is particularly strong at the beginning of the manuscript: of the first ten units, seven begin at the top of the page. There is no way this fea ture can have come about by chance. A copyist could have created it only by leaving a blank space at the bottom of the preceding page, or by writing very large or very small on the preceding page ;but the writer of the manuscript has done neither. Only an author, in full control of his or her prolixity, could have achieved this effect?7 It follows that Hazzan was not only the author of the text but also the writer of the manuscript, and that, for one reason or another — presumably aesthetic — he was initially ready to take pains to insure that his units of con tent corresponded to the tops of his pages. He eventually grew less inclined (56) Psalm42 (fol 7r),Psalm43(241־),Psalm 24(24v),Psalm 1g(25v),Psalm 26(311•),Psalm 27 (33v),Psalm 88 (37v),Exod 16:4-36(4^),Psalm 46(541־), Deut 30:iff (59V),Psalm 30(70v),J0b 38-39 (72V), Psalm 112(991•),Ps 142:3-8 (124V), Psalm 143(125v). (57) This is perhaps what Scholem intended by his cryptic remark that "the manner of writ ing and the ordering [siddur] of the pages strengthen the impression that we have before us the author's own autograph"("Perush mizmorei tehillim"p. 158; Liebes, p.90).</page><page sequence="19">[1g][1g] THE SON OF THE MESSIAH 161 to make this effort, which is why the feature fades away as the commentary progresses. I do not claim to have presented absolute proof that our manuscript is an autograph. I intend, however, to have created a presumption in favor of that view, and thereby to dispose the reader to accept the interpretation I am about to offer of another feature of the manuscript: the very considerable fluctu ations, observed by Scholem, in the quality of its handwriting. This seemingly trivial detail will prove to have weighty implications for our understanding of the Sabbatian Aqedah, and of the fate of Ishmael Zevi. There is a certain regularity in the fluctuations. The first page of the manu script is written in a small, very neat, really beautiful script.The script gradu ally slides downhill over the next dozen or so folio pages, becoming slightly larger and considerably more sloppy. And then a new feature begins to assert itself. The writer periodically gets hold of himself, as it were, and begins to write again with his original neatness. This happens over and over. Unfortu nately for the reader, the script again degenerates fairly rapidly. It becomes, overall, more and more slovenly as the manuscript progresses, so that the con trasts between the writer's "fresh starts"and the scrawl into which they quickly decline become, in the second half of the manuscript, very striking.58 If we are prepared to grant the probability that Israel Hazzan is himself the writer of our manuscript,a very natural interpretation of these shifts will sug gest itself. They reflect the tension between Hazzan's wish to write legibly, and his need to get on paper the ideas that bubbled up from his mind. He nor mally writes rapidly and carelessly because the force of his inspiration will not allow him to do otherwise. He leaves his writing for a time, then returns. He begins the new session writing neatly and carefully. (These are the "fresh starts.") But literary inspiration soon wins out over scribal care ; soon he is once again scribbling down his ideas as fast as they come to him. If this is correct, it has a consequence. The"fresh starts "observable in the manuscript's handwriting will serve as markers of the stages in which Hazzan's commentary was composed — which do not necessarily (or even normally) correspond to its units of content. We can distinguish at least some of the points at which Hazzan stood up from his desk, to resume his work at some later time. If we were to suppose that the stages of composition followed rapidly upon one another, this might be a matter of small importance. There is evidence, however, that they were spaced widely enough that significant events might (58) The clearest examples of the"fresh starts"are on fols41r-v, 6gv, 73V, 78V, 86r, g3v-g4r, 104r, liov-mr, 112r, 116v-n7r, 123V, 134r.</page><page sequence="20">162 DAVID J. HALPERIN [20] happen between them.On fol 18v,Hazzan cites an alphabetic/numerological tour de force, involving Sabbatai Zevi's name,which he attributes to"the flaw less sage, the excellent judge, the rabbi, the divine Kabbalist, our honored teacher Rabbijacob Ashkenazi, nr-v"'39He concludes the citation with :"These are his words, which I heard from his holy mouth'.' Hazzan's use of the formula nr-vnr-vnr-v (netareh rahmana ufarqeh," the Merciful One protect and save hi m','or the like) shows clearly that he believes Ashkenazi to be alive. A second passage of this sort appears on fol 35v~36r. Hazzan introduces it, "I heard from the holy mouth of the divine rabbi, our honored teacher Rabbi Jacob Ashkenazi, nr-v" ; but concludes,"These are his holy words, z-l [zikhrono li-vrakhah,'li-vrakhah,' may his memory be a blessing']'.' It is strange that Ashkenazi should be spoken of as living (nr-v) at the beginning of the passage, and as dead(z-Z) less than four lines later. Scholem calls attention to the anomaly, but does not try to explain it. The most reasonable explanation seems to me that Hazzan received the news of Ashkenazi's death between writing fol 18r and fols g yv-gbr. (At least one"fresh start" intervenes between the two passages, on fohç)r,and there is perhaps an other on fol 2 tr.) As he began the second passage, he wrote nr-v after Ashke nazi's name, out of habit. He did not erase this expression or mark it for era sure, perhaps out of a feeling that a blessing ought not to be effaced. But at the end of the passage he corrected it with the more appropriate blessing, z-l. To be sure, this peculiarity will not by itself prove that MS Kaufmann 255 is Hazzan's autograph. The shift in the blessing after Ashkenazi's name might well have originated as I have suggested in Hazzan's original composition,and (59) Ashkenazi is the only Sabbatian ideologue, other than Nathan, whom Hazzan quotes by name.The obscurity that now surrounds the man is itself something of a mystery, since there is evidence that he was regarded in the 1670s as one of the movement's leading intellectuals. Writ inging shortly after 1701,Cardozo relates a story that he supposedly heard (in 1682) from aman who had visited Sabbatai Zevi two weeks before his death. Sabbatai allegedly represented Cardozo to his visitors as a man of stature comparable to Ashkenazi's, to Nathan's, even to Sabbatai's own (Molho and Amarillo,"Autobiographical Letters,"pp. 217-18).Obviously,Cardozo had a motive to invent this story. But what motive would he have had to introduce Ashkenazi's name in this context, if he had not at one point been regarded by Sabbatians as a thinker second only to Na than himself? The story contains another detail that suggests its authenticity. Cardozo mentions "Mullah"Mullah cAli"as Sabbatai's messenger from Dulcigno to Adrianople; and"MullahcAli"appears also in Israel Hazzan's commentary (fol 107V),again in the role of messenger (see below). It seems best to assume that Cardozo's story, like Hazzan's commentary, preserves an accurate reflection of the Sabbatian world of the 1670s, as seen from the Balkans. Cardozo tells a remarkable story about his own encounter with Jacob Ashkenazi, which may perhaps provide a clue as to why the Sabbatians preferred to forget him :"When the rumor arrived that Sabbatai Zevi had died in Alkum [Dulcigno],I was in Edirne [Adrianople].I went to the great scholar Rabbi Jacob Ashke nazi and I said to him, Sabbatai Zevi is dead; what says Your Worship to that? He replied, If Sabbatai Zevi is dead to you, go find another God" ("Autobiographical Letters," pp. 203-04).</page><page sequence="21">[21] THE SON OF THE MESSIAH 163 then been unthinkingly reproduced by a copyist. But it will make us sensitive to the possibility that the stages in the creation of the manuscript may at times mirror the changing events in Hazzan's environment, as well as the develop ments of his own thought. In particular, it will prepare us for the possibility that one particular "fresh start','within the section of the manuscript that deals with the Aqedah(fol 108r), marks a major crisis of faith for Israel Hazzan. This crisis, I will suggest, transformed his expectations for Ishmael Zevi and his understanding of the Aqedah itself. For, in the interval between Hazzan's leaving his writing desk and his returning to it, he learned that his young Messiah was dead. 4. A Messiah is Born We have already seen that all of the text's allusions to Ishmael, without any exception, occur within its commentary on what I have called the"displaced sequence": those nine Biblical passages,beginning with Psalm 34 and ending with the Aqedah, that Hazzan chose to shift from the middle to the end of the tiqquntiqqun hasot liturgy. He first appears in the commentary on the second of these passages, Psalm 37. I I have been a lad and have grown old, says 3 7:2 5 ; y et I have not seen the righteous forsaken forsaken or his seed [zarco] seeking bread. The righteous, Hazzan interprets, may have left the Jewish people ; he may be among the qelippot. Yet he is never for saken by the Shechinah, who has been with him always since his soul was ere ated; that is, since before the creation of the world. He is, needless to say, Sabbatai Zevi. Hazzan has made this point,or a similar one,a dozen times over. The notion that Sabbatai Zevi and the Shechinah are inseparable companions, together doomed to dress in alien garb and enter the"great abyss "of the qelippot, is one of the recurrent themes that bind his commentary together from its begin ning to its end. (So is the idea of a trinity composed of the Blessed Holy One, the female Shechinah,and their "beloved son'Sabbatai Zevi.) But this time he adds something new. "HA seed : this is our Lord Ishmael, may his majesty be exalted exalted ?0Seeking bread: this means, seeking theTorah... he does not seek it, for it is always with him, and never leaves him or his holy seed." When the next verse of the psalm adds that his seed [zarco]is a blessing, Hazzan takes this to mean that Ishmael will join his father in blessing those Jewish souls who had become ensnared in"the depths of the great abyss"(fol 97V). Hazzan leaves Ishmael for the time being, and develops his familiar theme of holy souls being oppressed among the qelippot (fols 97V-98V). But he evi (60) Yr-h,yarum hodo; the familar Messianic blessing formula of the Sabbatians, normally ap plied to Sabbatai himself. Hazzan's uses of this formula will engage our attention as we proceed.</page><page sequence="22">164 DAVID J. HALPER1N [22] dently wants to get back to him as soon as possible. We have already seen that he skips over the next three psalms of the liturgy (40,63, in),briefly noting that he or Nathan has already dealt with these texts somewhere else (fol 98V). This allows him to move straight to Psalm 112, which contains the key word zarcozarco in its very second verse; and, in this context, to tell us more about the Messiah's son. The true man ivho fears the Lord (Ps 112:1),Hazzan says, is Sabbatai Zevi "His seed shall be mighty on the earth seed shall be mighty on the earth [verse 2]: this isourLordlshmael,may his majesty be exalted, who will sit on his throne on the earth. Ami ram is to ascend to a rank that is beyond the comprehension of any created being; but his seed shall be be mighty on earth and he is our lord. Ami rah called him thus; he said to us, This is your lord"(fol ggr-v). Hazzan seems to imply that, in the presence of him and other people, Sab batai Zevi had declared Ishmael to be "your lord." He indeed seems to have known Sabbatai, at least from a distance?1 But the claim he makes here is more than a little doubtful. If Sabbatai had in fact formally announced to the be lievers that his son was to be their lord (after his death, presumably), it is hard to believe that Hazzan — who has been wrestling throughout the commen tary with the problem of the Messiah's death — should only now have thought to mention it. The notion of Ishmael as Sabbatai's successor and vicar on earth is evidently a novelty, to which Hazzan expects some resistance. For he anticipates a complaint :"Have we then labored in vain ?. . . Our wish is to see our king !"That is, the believer's love and expectation is for Sabbatai Zevi himself, not his son. He therefore finds in the end of Ps 112:2 an assur ance that it will be Sabbatai himself who will give us the perfect blessing. He is still superior to his son, but less immediately present to the believer. Even as he recedes into incomprehensible exaltation, Ishmael is lord on earth. Hazzan finds nothing more about Ishmael in this psalm, or in the psalm (51) that follows. But, when he turns to Psalm 72,Ishmael appears through out.This psalm announces at its beginning that it is"Solomon's!' We may guess that, as Hazzan understands the"David"who speaks in most of the psalms to be a"type"of Sabbatai Zevi, so he imagines David's son to be a"type"of Sab batai's son. The subject of Psalm 72 is therefore Ishmael Zevi. He does not make this point explicitly. In standard Kabbalistic fashion, he identifies the"Solomon"of the beginning of the psalm with the sefirah Tif'eret. We have not long to wait, however, before Ishmael makes his appearance. "Give"Give your judgments to the king [verse 1 ] : this is Am i raii. And your righteousness to to the king's son: this is our Lord Ishmael, may his majesty be exalted. He shall judge your people in righteousness: this refers to the king's son. . . . He will not (61) Scholem,"Perush mizmorei tehillim"pp. 162-75, especially the story quoted on p.165 from fol !or (Liebes, pp. 93-110, esp. p. 97).</page><page sequence="23">[23] THE SON OF THE MESSIAH 165 need witnesses; for, thanks to his Creator's wisdom that he possesses, he is both witness and judge"(fol 102r). Acting on God's behalf, he will vindicate the oppressed and insulted "poor "(that is, the Sabbatian faithful) against the community leaders, and bring them forth into the light. He next appears in connection with the opening words of verse 7. "When the kingdom of our Lord Ishmael, who is our Messiah, is revealed, in his days the the righteous one — Am i rah, that is — will blossom. He will become visible to us, out of the concealment [heclem\ into which he disappeared from us. We shall see him with our own eyes"(fol 102v).Hazzan has previously explained the phrase dor dorim, in verse 5, to mean that three generations will elapse from the proclamation of Sabbatai's kingdom (that is, 1665) to"the dawning of his true light','when he will reappear to reveal the mysteries of God's divinity. Sab batai will then make peace among the Jewish people; he will bring effluence down from the upper sefirot to the lower; he will rescue the fallen souls; he will receive the obeisance of Gentile and demonic powers," mending "them even as he dominates them (fols 102v-103r). Hazzan evidendy conceives Ishmael's Messianic rule as a transitional phase toward the final, full Messiahship of his father, which is now pushed several decades into the future. We are again assured that Sabbatai Zevi will reap pear in person."Do not say that you have already seen, or heard people say ing, that he is dead. Do not be afraid; he himself will live" (fol 103V). Yet, even while assuring us that Ishmael will not usurp his father's glory, Hazzan suggests that he will do just that — in these lower realms, at least. He understands the cryptic words pissat bar at the beginning of verse 16 to mean hand hand hand of the son6} The"son" in question is"the beloved son,his firstborn son" These phrases (from Jer 31:20, Exod 4:22) are significant. Hazzan has again and again applied them to Sabbatai Zevi — "beloved son"of the Blessed Holy One and his Shechinah — but now transfers them to Sabbatai's own"beloved son" Ishmael.'Thus shall [the power of the hand of]63 the son of Zevi be upon the earth,earth,ruling the whole world. Am i rah, through his exaltation,shall be in the supernal realms, while his son is in the lower realms ... at the head of all the saints. ... He will make all the kingdoms tremble... he will also resurrect the dead" (fol 103V). (62) In support of this interpretation, he calls attention to the phrase nashequvar in Ps 2:12; which, following the Zohar {Racya Mehernna, 11,120b; cf. Ill, 1g1b),he understands to mean,ter the the son. (63) The bracketed words (fcoaAyad, in the original ) are inserted between the lines of the text. They are obviously based on Hazzan's interpretation of pissat bar. It is difficult to imagine how a copyist would have accidentally omitted them ; easy to imagine that Hazzan himself, all afire with thoughts of the future glory of the son of Zevi, might have left them out and later returned to correct himself.</page><page sequence="24">166 DAVID J. HALPERIN [24] And, in expounding 72:17,Hazzan seems to hint that Ishmael is actually superior to his father. May May his name endure for ever, before the sun.This means, in the lifetime of his father, and before him. [There follows a complicated gematria equat ing ha-shemesh," the sun" wi th Sabbatai Zevi ; and Ishmael Zeui with with yehi shemoshemo lecolam,"may his name endure for ever." Hence :] Ishmael Zevi will be before his father, Sabbatai Zevi. May his name endure for ever, before the sun,sun, his name is "yinnon"; which has the meaning "offspring."64 This means, the son shall be before the father [fols 103v-104r]. What does Hazzan mean by saying that"the son shall be before the father" (lifnei(lifnei ha-av yihyeh ha-ben)} Perhaps that he is "before" his father in a fairly modest temporal sense, that his Messianic rule will precede his father's.This is supported by fol 102b, where ve-lifnei yareah dor dorim (72:5) is taken to mean that the believers "held to their faith before [lifnei] the rising of the supernal sun [Sabbatai Zevi],while [their] light was still that of the moon that comes before [lifnei] the sun." But we must not forget that Hazzan is likely to have read Ps 72:17 through the lenses of the well-known Talmudic aggadot in Sanhédrin 98b and Pesa him 54a.The former passage infers fromyinnon shemo that the Messiah's name is actually"Yinnonrwhile the latter argues from lifnei shemesh that the Messi ah's name existed before the creation. Hazzan has repeatedly claimed that Sabbatai Zevi's soul existed before the creation. (Cf. the beginning of this sec tion.) Now, by equating yinnon with Sabbatai's offspring and shemesh with Sab batai himself, he elevates Ishmael to an even higher rank. If the father pre existed the world, the son pre-existed the father. To judge from the carelessness of the handwriting, Hazzan was in a state of high excitement as he wrote his interpretation of Ps 72:17. Immediately af terward(fol to4r),the script becomes severely neat; that is, as I have sug gested above, he left his composition for some time and then returned to it?5 The exposition of Psalm 72 concludes without further reference to Ishmael (fol 104r-v). In the mean time, we have seen Ishmael's star,emerging from obscurity,ex plode into something like supernova proportions. He is the Messiah. He is the divinely appointed and inspired judge, to whom the harassed and humil iated community of believers may look for vindication. He will rule the saints (64) Derivingyinnon from nin ve-nekhed(Isa 14:22).

He will terrorize the Gentiles (whom his father will later "mend"?). He will resurrect the dead; duplicating, in this re spect, his father's prowess (see below). He has begun to usurp his father's ti ties of "beloved son','" first-born son!'And, if I have correcdy interpreted the end of the passage, he has trumped his father's pre-existence. How much of this development did Hazzan have in mind when he first made the decision to postpone the Psalm 34-Aqedah sequence to the end of his commentary? It is impossible to say. His absolute silence about Ishmael in the fifty or so folio pages that contain his expositions of the passages from Exodus 16 through Proverbs 31 — which, according to my hypothesis,he must have composed after he made this decision — suggests that he initially had no idea of the importance that Ishmael was soon to assume. We might perhaps speculate that rumors from Adrianople, where Ishmael and his stepmother had apparently been living since shortly after Sabbatai's death (above),stim ulated Hazzan's hopes and his imagination far beyond what he had origi nally anticipated. These hopes,and the entire Messianic saga of Ishmael Zevi that Hazzan had constructed, were to reach their climax in the Aqedah. 5. Aqedah, Ishmael, Islam (I) What did the Aqedah mean to Israel Hazzan? If we are to see this issue in perspective, we must first clarify what the Aqedah might have been expected to mean to any Jew, Sabbatian or non-Sabbatian, toward the end of the sev enteenth century. Given the Sabbatians' particular investment in Islam, we must clarify as well the role played by the Aqedah in the Muslim-Jewish con troversy of the preceding thousand years. Our answers to both questions must be provisional. Both topics cover vast amounts of territory; little systematic research has been devoted to either. Many scholars, to be sure, have written about the Aqedah and its traditions. But their concerns have normally been with aspects of the Aqedah other than those that now require our attention. Scholars of the Hebrew Bible have wanted to know about the implications of Genesis 22 for the religion of an cient Israel, particularly with regard to child sacrifice ; scholars of New Testa ment and early Christianity have wanted to know what impact Jewish Aqedah traditions might have had on Pauline Christology — or the other way round?6 The role of the Aqedah in the Jewish martyrologies of the time of the Cru (66) These two topics are the focus of Jon D. Levenson's Death and Resurrection of the Beloved Son.Son.Son.The literature on the Aqedah and early Christianity is very extensive ; the papers collected in Frédéric Manns, The Sacrifice of Isaac in the Three Monotheistic Religions (Jerusalem, 1995), en lightening in themselves,are also useful bibliographic resources on this subject.(! am grateful</page><page sequence="26">168 DAVI D J. HALPE RI N [26] sades has attracted some attention ; this was, indeed, the starting point of Sha lom Spiegel's classic The Last '/,««/.67Students of modern Hebrew literature have explored the impact of the Aqedah theme on Israeli novels and poetry.68 But comparative interest in the role of the Aqedah in the Abrahamic tradi tions has normally been focussed on the periods in which those traditions di verged from one another; that is, the early centuries of the Christian and the Islamic eras.69And no one, to my knowledge, has systematically studied the shape of the Jewish Aqedah tradition in the period that most immediately concerns us: the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Before turning to Israel Hazzan's Aqedah, therefore, we must consider how the Aqedah figured injewish-lslamic polemics in the centuries that preceded him. We will then examine the Aqedah as it is represented by three early mod ernern Jewish authors: Isaac Abarbanel,Isaiah Horowitz,and Hayyim Kohen of Aleppo. Their portrayals of the Aqedah, as we will see, shade together into a common picture. We have reason to suppose, moreover, that these authors are likely to have exercised direct or indirect influence on Hazzan. It there fore seems afair assumption that the common picture that emerges from their works is likely to have been the starting point of Hazzan's own thinking about the Aqedah; and that, by contemplating that picture, we will have a context and perspective in which to view Hazzan's highly original contributions. The Qur'an,as is well known, tells the story of the Aqedah without specifying which of Abraham's two sons was the intended victim (Surah 37:99-113). Early Muslim traditionists debated the question of whether the honor be longed to Isaac,as the Jews and the Christians claimed; or to Ishmaefwhom the Arabs were coming to regard as their ancestor. By the ninth or the tenth century, the"Ishmael"school had won out (although it could never claim unanimous support)?0Muslims preferred to dismiss the claims on Isaac's be to Professor Marc Bregman,who contributed a particularly stimulating paper to this collection, for providing me with the reference to it.)

An anonymous Jewish scholar,converted to Islam,was supposed to have toldcUmar b.cAbd al-cAziz (caliph 717-20) : "The Jews know that [Ishmael was the intended victim], but they are envious of you, O Arabs, because it was your father who was named in God's command and to whom God ascribed such merit for his steadfastness in obeying God's command. They reject that and claim that it was Isaac be cause Isaac was their father."71 The story of cUmar and the Jewish scholar would suggest that that the iden titytity of the Aqedah victim was a fairly significant issue between Jews and Mus lims in the first century after the Hijrah,and that the"Ishmael" identification may have marked an important step in the process of Islam's defining itself over against the older Abrahamic traditions.The issue seems to have retained some importance for medieval Qur'an commentators and tellers of "tales of the prophets.'Tt perhaps took on fresh significance in the hands of non-Arab Shi'ites, who, if Reuven Firestone is right, may have tried to resurrect the "Isaac"identification as a tool in their controversy with Sunni Islam(2 For Muslim writers engaged in extramural controversy, by contrast, the question of whether Isaac or Ishmael belongs in the Aqedah story seems to have lost whatever interest it once had. I have not found a single Muslim po lemicist against Judaism — or Christianity for that matter, although I cannot claim to have made any systematic examination of anti-Christian polemic — who so much as mentions this issue, even where the context would seem to invite discussion of it.

Similarly, a fourteenth century Morisco polemic against Judaism includes a defense of Hagar and Ishmael against, e.g., the charge that Hagar was a mere concubine(4 But (to judge from the summary provided by Miguel Asin Palacios) the writer makes no mention in this context of Ishmael's having been intended for sacrifice(5 Last Prophet :ALast Prophet :ALast Prophet :A I&amp;constructionofthe Earliest Biography of Muhammad y1qHg),pp. 8ך-6ך.

HALPERIN [28] It is evident that, for most Muslims in the Middle Ages and into modern times, the Aqedah had nothing at all comparable to its pivotal importance for Judaism?6ThevirtuesofIshmael,as Arab progenitor andMuslim prophet, must be maintained. But Ishmael's near-sacrifice was in no way remarkable among these virtues.The Aqedah was an interesting prophet-story, nothing more.77 Perhaps reflecting this Muslim indifference, the few medieval Jewish writ ers who undertook to combat the claims of Islam seem to have been little con cerned with the identity of the Aqedah victim. The best informed and most careful of them,Sacd ibn Mansur ibn Kammuna(1280)78does not mention the question at alfi'Simeon b. Semah Duran, in his critique of Islam (142 3), touches upon it as lightly as might be imagined. At the end of a list of Islamic distor tions of Biblical stories, he notes that the Muslims "claim that the Aqedah was for Ishmael, that it took place in Mecca, and that [people] have seen there [in Mecca] the horn of the primordial ram'.'80 He adds, however :"They have diver gent opinions on this matter, some saying that it was Isaac who was bound."81 of the Torah, he invokes evidence from the Torah itself, including the fact that"Dios manda a Abraham sacrificar su hijo Isaac,y en seguida désisté de su mandato"(ibid,., p.254).If the writer saw any significance in the intended victim's being Isaac instead of Ishmael, Asin Palacios does not convey it. (76) Hava Lazarus-Yafeh, Intertzvined Worlds: Medieval Islam and Bible Criticism (Princeton, 1992), 1992), mentions the Aqedah only in connection with the abrogation issue (see the preceding note ),not the identity of the victim.The issue has perhaps regained some importance for Mus lims in recent times, possibly sparked by the requirements of dialogue with both Jews and Chris tians:cAmer Yunis,"The Sacrifice of Abraham in Islam','in Frédéric Manns ,The Sacrifice of Isaac (above, n.66), pp. 147-57. (77) Al-Rabghuzi, who wrote a book of prophet-stories in Eastern Turkish about the year 1300, takes for granted that Ishmael is the intended sacrifice. He remarks that the Jews say dif ferently,"because the Jews and Christians are all Isaac's descendants." But he seems quite unex cited about the issue, and at one point suggests that both Ishmael and Isaac were at different times intended for sacrifice : Al-Rabghuzi :The Stories of the Prophets, H.E.Boeschoten, M.Vandamme, and S.Tezcan,(ed./tr.)(Leiden,1g95),vol.2,pp. 121-29.

I do not know Duran's basis for this claim, which</page><page sequence="29">[2g] the son of the Messiah 171 A different tone is perhaps audible in Isaac Abarbanel's commentary on Genesis 2 2, written some eighty years later.82 The Bible's designation of Isaac as thine only son(yehidekha, verse 2)83is peculiar, he notes, since Isaac was Sarah's only only son but obviously not Abraham's.'Ttwas on this basis that the Ishmaelites stupidly advanced their claim that the one who was bound was Ishmael, since, before Isaac's birth, he was the only son both of his father and of his mother." There is nothing particularly implausible about Abarbanel's claim that Muslims used Gen 22:2 to prove that Ishmael was the intended sacrifice, though I have seen no direct evidence to support it?4(Medieval Muslim po lemicists made plentiful use of Biblical quotations when it served their pur pose to do so.) The very fact that he goes out of his way to mention this point suggests that, in Jewish if not Muslim consciousness, the question of the Aqe dah victim had begun to assume new importance as an issue dividing the two faiths.This is perhaps linked to Abarbanel's subsequent remark defending the particular care he has devoted to the exegesis of Genesis 2 2 :"This chapter is the entire strength [qeren] of Israel, and their merit[zekhutam] before their Fa ther in heaven.That is why we regularly use it in our prayer each day "(p. 265)?® It is at least thinkable that,for Abarbanel, the Muslim identification of the vie tim as Ishmael had come to seem an assault, substantial enough to be worth rejecting, on the qeren and zekhut of the Jewish people. Let us take Abarbanel's commentary as a starting point for exploring our next question : how did Jews view the Aqedah, and particularly its intended victim, during the nearly two hundred years that separate his commentary from that of Israel Hazzan?86 seems to reflect a remarkable recapitulation, within Islam, of tensions in early Judaism over whether the Aqedah was to be connected with Passover or with Rosh Hashanah ( Levenson, The Death Death and Resurrection of the Beloved Son, pp. 173-83).

HALPERIN [30] For Abarbanel, Isaac's sacrifice represents the sacrifice of his bodily, nat ural aspect. This, despite the impression God initially gave Abraham, was the only sacrifice that was really intended; and it was successfully carried out. The result of Adam's sin had been that humans were given over to their de sires, particularly the sexual. Now, by "coming to the gates of death"at God's command and thus vanquishing his corporeal being, Isaac has redeemed his offspring from bondage to this primordial sin, as well as from the astral pow ers that control natural activity.8'The ass that Abraham saddles (literally, "binds"va-ya/tavosA)is figuratively to be understood, not as hamor, but as ho mer:mer: by that act of "binding," Abraham subdues his materiality. It is in this sense, says Abarbanel, that we are to understand the midrash88 that claims Abraham's ass to have been the very same beast that Moses rode (Exod4:20)and that the Messiah will somedayride(Zechariah9:9).In receiv ing the Torah, Moses took the next step in the process of subduing our ma teriality; and the Messiah will bring this process to its completion?9The equa tion of Abraham's ass with the Messianic beast, which Hazzan was later to take literally, is thus allegorized to make the Aqedah the opening act of a process of Messianic salvation. Given Isaac's pivotal role in this process, it makes ex cellent sense that Abarbanel should have perceived his replacement by Ish mael as a threat to be warded off. A similar metaphysical exaltation is credited to Isaac in Isaiah Horowitz's widely influential Shenei luhot ha-berit(completed in 1623, first published in 1648)!)0Isaac here becomes a second Adam, replicating Adam's state before the sin and providing a"mending "for his prototype's failing.91 This"mending " with the Pentateuch commentaries of the ever-popular Rashi (owned by 118 families) or Bahya ben Asher (owned by 91 ). But, in an age of expensive books, it seems a more than respectable distribution. (87) Abarbanel, Perush cal ha-torah, vol. 1, pp. 265-78. To express this liberation from what Christians would have called "original sin','Abarbanel uses such expressions bo[be-yishaq]yifdehelo him him et zarco min yeser lev adam rac mi-necurav, and she-tusar mimmennu zuhamat ha-nahash she-hittil calcal havvah. . . bacavur tocelet kelal ummatenu (p. 266).

Following the venerable Jewish tradition that has Isaac actually die and come back to life in the course of the Aqedah?3 Horowitz represents Isaac's soul as having left him and "the holy spirit from on high" having taken its place. Isaac is thus a new creation ( beri 'ah hadashah), bearer of a new and holier life-essence life-essence (hayyut he-hadash or ha-s heni), the first being since Adam that was not created from sperm (she-lo nosar mi-tippah)9.4"His soul ascended on high and returned to him other than it had been. . . . Thus the bodily life of that Isaac who had been born of sperm ceased to be [nitbattel],and he now had holy flesh."95In this sacrifice, Isaac had"become holy of holies, a pure burnt offering, a pleasant smell for the Lord"; and had become, in his lifetime,what other saints could be only after their deaths — a sacrifice offered to God by the celestial high priest Michael?6 All of this is very redolent of Christianity. So is the further step taken by Horowitz : of linking the Aqedah with the meal that, according to Genesis 18, Abraham prepared for his three visitors. Abraham's meal, says Horowitz,fore shadows the eschatological feast that God will prepare for the saints "when he restores the world to the pristine state that it would have had if Adam had not sinned, and when materiality [homer] becomes purified. . . . This is why Isaac's birth was announced at this feast [of Abraham's] : he [Isaac] is the cause of this [eschatological feast]."97One can hardly avoid thinking of the Last Supper, and of the eschatological overtones given it in such passages as Luke 22:15-18. Let us follow Horowitz's argument yet one step further. Immediately after the passage I have just quoted, Horowitz invokes a marvellous Talmudic mid tiqqentiqqen te-adam she-hatas'rz-l[she-ameru rabbotenu zikhronam li-verakhah]moshekhcorlato hay ah (p. 81). Horowitz's reference is to BT Sanhédrin 38b. (92) See the previous note, and p.82, where Horowitz finds it significant that Abraham be got Isaac after he had himself been circumcised.

We will look at this midrash more closely in section 8,below, when we consider what Israel Hazzan does with it. Here we may note that Horo witz picks up on the incongruity, from the Kabbalistic viewpoint, of the Tal mud's representing the benevolent patriarch as Isaac (Gevurah, the attribute of strict judgment) and not Abraham {Hesed, the attribute of grace). The ex planation, he says, is that the world's eschatological purification, and its re turn to the state it was in before Adam's sin, depends on strict judgment — which thus proves to be the greatest mercy. Hence the paradox that Isaac/ justice is effectively the begetter of Abraham/mercy, and that the son's power is therefore greater than the father's. Yafeh koah ha-ben mi-koah ha-av ki middat ha-dinha-din ha-zeh gorem be-esem ha-rahimim. We perhaps hear an echo of this formulation in Hazzan's claim, which I discussed at the end of section 4, that "the son [Ishmael Zevi] shall be before the father"(/«/^« ha-avyihyeh ha-ben)When we take up Hazzan's Aqedah, we shall find there a parallel to the observation with which Horowitz concludes his argument: that the name'Tsaac," currently indicative of judgment, will in the eschaton manifest its more genial overtones of "laugh ter "and "joy." The third writer we shall consider, the Kabbalist Hayyim Kohen of Aleppo, in eludes his Aqedah exegesis within a homily for Rosh Hashanah, published in 1654 as part of his Torat hakhamm Kohen's homily shows affinities with both Abarbanel (whom he occasionally cites explicitly,"and obviously used as a re source) and the Shenei luhot ha-berit.This author seems to have been regarded as something of an authority in Sabbatian circles: Nathan of Gaza quotes him in his letter tojoseph Zevi,100and Cardozo claims to have studied with him while in Egypt!01 We may therefore presume, at least as a working hypothesis, that Israel Hazzan may have been familiar with Kohen's exegesis of the Aqedah. The homily is extremely prolix and diffuse, and it is impossible to give a clear summary of its argumen t. Its overall theme — which was a few years later (g8) Venice, 1654; reprinted Brooklyn, 1992.

One of these is that the"great feast"mentioned in Gen 21:8 is aforeshadow ing of the great eschatological feast (cols. 38c-d). To be sure, Kohen can in vokeTalmudic authority for this claim: BT Pesahim 119b, which interprets Gen 21:8 to mean that the Lord will make a feast for the righteous on that future date when" he shows his kindness to the seed of Isaac!'But he carries the Talmud's hints to extreme lengths. The Jews, he says, are properly called "the seed of Isaac" inasmuch as Isaac, through his Aqedah, is their savior and defender. They have survived in this world thanks to the merit of the Aqedah, "the ashes of Isaac that are heaped upon the altar"(col. 38d,cf-3gd, 48b)!04 Isaac's name points to their future joy, as represented by the eschatological feast(col.3gd ).Isaac even performs a"harrowing of hell'bn their behalf : those Jewish souls whom Abraham could not prevent from entering hell, Isaac de scends there to rescue.105 Kohen's linking of the Aqedah to a special meal, that takes place in the (102 )(102 ) He announces the theme by beginning his homily with Gen. R. tj$:2,a.petihah that takes its starting point from Ps 11:5, adonay saddiq yivhan.In cols. 48a-b, he makes what is perhaps his most explicit statement that the saddiqim stand ready to offer themselves as atoning sacrifices on the world's behalf, and that the Aqedah is to be put in this category. (And note his reference to Metatron offering the souls of the saddiqim on the celestial altar, which echoes a remark I have earlier quoted from Horowitz.) At the bottom of col. 46b, moreover, Kohen applies Isa 53:5 (a favorite verse of the Sabbatians) to the atoning sufferings of the righteous: yissurin. . . ha-nim sa'imsa'im ba-saddiqim kedei le-khapper cal cadat yisra'el. (103) E.g., that the saddiq often does things that seem bizarre or immoral to outsiders (David with Bathsheba,cols. 38b,390,460; Abraham and Sarah, cols. 3gd,40d-41a). Kohen's formula tion in col-40d is particularly striking: kol macasav shel avraham afcal gav she-hayu nir'im lecenei basarbasar shehem darkhei ish. . . ve-enam mehugganim lifnei ha-qadosh barukh hu be-zeh eno ken afillu dark heihei ish zeh avraham lefi shehu ish casato hem resuyim lifnei ha-qadosh barukh hu. All of this must have been music to Sabbatian ears; and we might conjecture that Kohen's repeated invocation of Hos 8:12, kemozar nehshavu(cols.40d,41b),foreshadows Sabbatai Zevi's macasim zarim. (104) For the rabbinic sources of this expression, see Levenson, The Death and Resurrection of the the Beloved Son, pp. 194-98; Spiegel, The Last Trial, pp. 28-44. (105) Col. 39a, bottom. Kohen claims to have seen this in "our sages'comments on the verse For you For you are our father [Isa 63:16]" but I have not been able to locate any rabbinic source for it. The opening of Kohen's alleged quotation,ve-yishaq le-hekha azal, is very suggestive of Gen. R. 67:7,but its continuation bears no resemblance whatever to the midrashic text. The conclusion to Mid rash rash Vayyoshac quotes Isa 63:16 in the context of God's redeeming the Jews from hell (in Adolf Jellinek,Jellinek, Bel ha-Midrash [reprinted Jerusalem, 1967],vol. 1, p. 57); but Isaac here plays no part whatever.

HALPERIN [34] distant past but foreshadows the eschatological feast, is very suggestive of Horowitz (and, of course, of the Last Supper). His shift of the meal, from Genesis 18 to Genesis 21, no doubt results from his intent to prepare a homily for Rosh Hashanah!06Again like Horowitz, he quotes BT Shabbat 8gb in sup port of Isaac's role as savior par excellence of the Jewish people (cols.38d.39d). Marks of Abarbanel's exegesis are also evident in Kohen's homily. Like Abarbanel, Kohen quotes Pirqei de-Rabbi Eliezer's assertion that Abraham's ha mar mar was also the one ridden by Moses and the Messiah, and interprets it much as Abarbanel did.Hamar is to be understood as homer•, the riding of the ass represents the subjugation of materiality; the lesson is that "Israel's materi ality will in the future be as pure as in the time of creation. He shall swallow up up death forever"101 But Kohen spells out the eschatological implications of this reading of the Aqedah.in considerably more detail than did Abarbanel. WhenPirqei de-Rabbi Eliezer goesEliezer goes on to say that Abraham's two young men (whom it identifies as Ish mael and Eliezer) quarreled over Abraham's inheritance, Kohen spells out what may have been implicit in the original midrash : these are Christendom and Islam, who quarrel over the land that properly belongs to the Jews and build their sanctuaries in it. ("The community of Ishmael,"Kohen remarks, "have built the Temple for themselves.") Hence Abraham tells them ,abide ye here here (Gen 22:5), thereby permitting them to remain in the Holy Land till such time as the Messiah comes riding his ass (Zech 9:9). When that happens,then we we will come back to you (Gen 2 2:5), to execute judgments upon them. Follow ing BT Sanhédrin 98a, Kohen professes uncertainty whether this redemp tion will take place in a generation that is wholly virtuous or one that is wholly guilty (col. 47c). One seemingly minor feature of Kohen's Aqedah exegesis will take on considerable importance in connection with Israel Hazzan's Aqedah. In that relatively brief section of the homily that deals specifically with Genesis 22 (cols. 47a-48d) — and not, as far as I can see, elsewhere in the long homily — Kohen makes very heavy use of the midrashic technique of ribbuy 'inclusion.' What this means is that the word et, which properly functions in Hebrew as a marker of the accusative, can be midrashically understood to imply the près ence of some additional, unstated object of the verb that precedes.108To give ( 106) Genesis 21 is the Torah reading for the first day of Rosh Hashanah, Genesis 2 2 for the second. (107) Col. 47b; quoting Isa 25:8, a favorite catch-phrase of Kabbalistic eschatology. (108) Cam and af can function in the same way :etimgamim ribbuyim 'the words et and gam are terms indicating inclusion [of that which is unstated]' (Gen. R. 1:14; Theodor-Albeck[ed.]p. 12); ha-ribbuyha-ribbuy be-shalosh kshonot et gam ve-af there are three terms for inclusion [of the unstated], et, gam, and af' (Midrash ha-Gadol, preface to Genesis; Margaliotfed.] p. 23). (if. H.G.Enelow, The</page><page sequence="35">[351 THE SON OF THE MESSIAH 177 one example of this technique : the phrase et YHVHelohekha tira, in Deut 6:13, would normally be understood to mean ,you shallfear the Lord your God. But the Talmud represents Rabbi Akiba.with whom the principle of ribbuy is normally associated, as expounding the et to mean that scholars are to be included along with God as objects of reverence!09 Kohen resorts to this principle again and again in interpreting the Aqedah. In 22:2,et binekha'[take] thy son] is understood to include(le-rabbot)Isaac's mother along with Isaac (col. 47a; Kohen's point is neither Isaac nor Sarah put obstacles in Abraham's way). In verse 4, etha-maqom' [he saw] the place,'in eludes not only the"place"in a literal sense but God as well (col. 47c)!10 When Abraham Abraham bound Isaac his son (verse 9),the et of el yishaq beno comes to include Abraham himself: "as if Abraham had bound himself." (Or, alternatively, it in eludes the heavenly princes, who were bound at the Aqedah along with Isaac ; col. 48b.) Kohen finds no fewer than two such inclusions in verse 10, And Abra ham ham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his sow.The et that precedes y ado [hisy ado [his hand) is there to convey that Abraham tested the knife's evenness against his fingernail and his finger;111 while the et that precedes beno 'his son'conveys that Abraham saw himself as killing, not Isaac alone, but all the future offspring God had promised him."For [Isaac] was his single, solitary, unique son ; Ishmael was not called his son, inasmuch as he was the offspring of a Gentile slave woman. That was why God had called [Isaac, in verse 2] thy son,son, thine only sow" (col. 48b).112 Of the twenty-seven occurrences of the word et (or ve-et)in Gen 22:1-19, Kohen thus interprets five as ribbuyim. This seems an extraordinarily high per centage, and suggests that, for reasons about which I cannot speculate, Ko hen had come to regard this mode of exegesis as peculiarly appropriate for the Aqedah!13 We shall see in section 8 thatlsrael Hazzan followed in Kohen's MishnahMishnah of Rabbi Eliezer; or, TheMidrash of Thirty-two Hermeneutic Rules (New York, 1933), pp. 11—13; H. L. Strack and G. Sternberger, Introduction to the Talmud and Midrash ( Minneapolis, 1991 ), p. 26. ( 109) BT Pesahim 2 2b ; quoted,with two other examples,in Midrash ha-Gadol (preceding note). (110) Rabbinic texts habitually refer to God as ha-maqom. (111) In accord with BT Hullin 17b. (112) Abarbanel had given a similar explanation of why Isaac was called yehidekha :"The one [son],Ishmael,was no longer, since he had been driven from [Abraham's] house and was as though he had never been. Isaac thus remained his father's only son and his mother's only son"(Perush calcal ha-torah, p. 268).This is Abarbanel's answer to what he represents (above) as the Muslim argu ment,from Gen 22:2, that the intended sacrifice was Ishmael. (113) I am not aware of any precedent. One Zoharic exegesis of nissah et avraham (22:1) ap pears at first sight to involve a ribbuy, the et understood to signify that Isaac is being tested along with Abraham ( Zohar, 1,119b). But, as Cordovero points out (in Abraham Azulay, Or ha-hammah [Jerusalem, 1876 ; reprinted in Israel, n.d.],vol. 1, col. 99c), an altogether different principle is in volved : et, normally used in the Zohar for the sefirah Malkhut, is here applied to Isaac inasmuch as</page><page sequence="36">178 DAVID J. HALPERI N [36] footsteps; and, in this connection, the last of Kohen's ribbuyim will prove of very special interest. On the basis of these authors, I would offer the following sketch of the Aqe dah as it was perceived in seventeenth-centuryJudaism.The more important actor in the Aqedah is Isaac, not Abraham. (Yafeh koah ha-ben mi-koah ha-av, as Horowitz puts it.) Not only is he a willing victim in the sacrifice — a point Levenson has made in connection with the Aqedah tradition of Jewish antiq uity114— but he has become a superhuman savior figure who seems in large measure modelled after the Savior of Christianity. His sacrifice is actually ac complished. In the course of that sacrifice, he is transformed into a new and qualitatively different sort of creature. As an effect of that sacrifice, he has the power not only to defend his offspring against God's wrath and to redeem them from the torments of hell, but even to transform his offspring, and in deed the entire creation, into something qualitatively different from what they had been. This transformation is bound up with the eschatological future. These themes are most obviously linked by Abraham's donkey, which foreshadows the ass to be ridden by the Messianic king (Zech 9:9) ; more subtly, by the feast for which Isaac is the effective cause, and which foreshadows the eschatologi cal feast of the righteous. We may note,finally, that both Abarbanel and Kohen show some resistance toward toward "Ishmael's"encroachments upon their savior's prerogatives. Abarba nel records, and repudiates, Muslim claims that the only son of 2 2:2 must have been Ishmael rather than Isaac. Kohen notes that the Ishmaelites have rebuilt the Jerusalem Temple, but for their own religious use ; he promises that they will be judged and ejected ; he rejects the possibility that Ishmael might prop erly be called Abraham's son at all.116 Thus far the legacy that Hazzan received. What does he himself do with the Aqedah? And what role is played in it by Ishmael Zevi? 6. Aqedah, Ishmael, Islam (II) Let us begin by observing that Hazzan expounds the Aqedah not once but twice. His first exegetical essay on the subject lies near the beginning of his work(fol 14V),in the course of a detailed exposition of the Zoharic myth of the he is currently resident in that.se/traAand not in his own proper sefirah( that is to say,Gevurah). (114) The Death and Resurrection of the Beloved Son, pp. 187-92. ( 115) It seems possible, though by no means certain, that Horowitz's disparaging reference to the seemingly "insane"Arab practice of prostrating oneself to the dust on one's feet (Shenei luhot ha-berit, vol. 4, p. 75; following BT Bava MesPa 86b) is an indirect jab at Islam. Cf. below n. 219.</page><page sequence="37">[37] THE SON OF THE MESSIAH 17g hind!16 This initial treatment of the topic bears almost no resemblance to what he was subsequently to write, once he had discovered the significance of Ishmael Zevi. In the earlier passage,Hazzan had focused his attention on Gen 22:3-4: And And Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men men with him, and Isaac his son; and he cleaved the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. On the third day Abra ham ham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. The morning, as he understood it, represents the eschaton. (This equation, which recurs throughout his com mentary, is practically the only element of his original interpretation to sur vive into his subsequent discussion of the Aqedah.) The figure of Abraham stands for the Kabbalistic sefirah of Hesed 'Grace! "Isaac" is the sefirah Gevurah 'stern judgment! to be exercised against the Gentiles.The third day alludes to the resurrection (in accord with Hos 6:2); the ass, to the beast that the Mes siah will ride (Zech 9:9); the cleaving of the wood, to the sinners — the Gentile nations, to judge from Hazzan's citation of Isa 33:12 — who are destined for burning. Abraham's two young men (necarav) are Metatronmand Sabbatai Zevi. The latter is indicated, not by name, but by successive citations of Isa 9:5 (a child [yeled[yeled] is born unto us, a son [ben] is given to us) and Hos 11:1( when Israel was a lad [nacar] )!18 What is significant here is that Sabbatai, the center of Hazzan's at tention, plays a secondary and perhaps even marginal role in the eschatolog ical drama of the Aqedah. Hazzan regularly speaks of him as'son! or as'be loved son' (ben yaqir, fol gv and frequendy)!19 But, remarkably, he does not think to equate him with the beloved son of Gen 22:2, still less with the fa ther who is going to sacrifice him. He remains essentially faithful to the Zo har's reading of the Aqedah (I,11ga-120b),in which the sefirotic symbolism predominates; but he overlays it with eschatology.120 Turning from here to Hazzan's formal exposition of the Aqedah,which be gins on fol 104V, we at first imagine that he is resuming the sefirotic line of interpretation. He prefaces his Aqedah exegesis with a heavily glossed and (116) In his commentary on Psalm 42 ;see above, n.46. (117) Whose standing designation is nacar 'youth! (118) Hazzan marks the word Israel with a double slash, to indicate that he is attributing a spe cial significance to it. He uses Israel and son throughout the commentary to designate Sabbatai Zevi; e.g., fols gv, 10v-11r. (119) Following Jer 31:19. ( 120) We recall from Abarbanel and Kohen the association of Abraham's donkey with that of the Messiah.We recall, also, that the sefirotic symbolism of "Abraham"and "Isaac" was practically absent from the writers we considered in the preceding section ; only Horowitz made any use of it at all.</page><page sequence="38">180 DAVID J. HALPERIN [38] expanded version of the prayer zokhrenu be-zikkaron tov,m in which he begs God to "remember," to the benefit of the Jewish people, various sefirotic en tities. God is to remember, also, the Aqedah by which Abraham (whom Hazzan has just equated with the sefirah Hesed) "bound his son Isaac upon the altar, the hidden reference being to the dinim [that is, the punitive aspects of divin ity] that he is going to sweeten and to mend." But no sooner does he begin to expound the Genesis text itself than he takes an altogether different tack. Abraham, he now declares, is both the 'ex alted father'( av ha-ram) and ז h e ' b i Iter father' ( av ha-mar). That is, he is Sabba tai Zevi, most supremely exalted and yet"made bitter through all the bitter nesses of the children of Israel."(This is an allusion to Sabbatai's entrance into the profane realm of Islam.)122And the"Isaac"of the Biblical story is none other than our Lord Ishmael. He is called"Isaac"in that he was born in a time in which the dinim had the upper hand over the hasadim]23in the epoch of the turban!24 He came into the world turban-wearing [that is, a Muslim], for the dinim were powerful at that time. He is"Isaac,"moreover, in that Israel will have all its laughter125 and joy through him [fols 104v-105r]. This transformation of "Isaac"into"Ishmael"— which at once brings to mind the Muslim reading of the Aqedah — is remarkable enough. Its immediate sequel is yet more remarkable. Hazzan goes on to make clear that the religion symbolized for him by the"turban"is near the center of his own understand ing of the Aqedah ; and not merely in the negative sense (which we saw in his earlier treatment of Genesis 22)that the Muslims are Gentiles to be punished (121) Derived originally from the zikhronot of the Rosh Hashanah musaf, but functioning as liturgical introduction to the reading of the Aqedah in the daily birkhot ha-shahar■.

This last observation leads Hazzan into a long excursus on Psalm 85 (fols 105r-107r).The central theme of this excursus is the combination of Judaism with Islam — or, more accurately, the penetration of Islam byjudaism — and justification and praise of those"pious ones" who have undertaken this pen etration.(They are called God's'pious ones' hasidav, because they have en tered tor at hesed, which is Islam; fol 106r.)B0th these Jewish-Muslim pioneers, and those Jews who have remained within their Judaism, are equally recipi ents of the divineshalom(Ps 85:g).But,says Hazzan, the psalm must go on to assure the"pious "apostates that they shall not return to folly.They shall not re main within Islam, that "path of fools and lunatics"— good only for a provi sional act of "mending"that is unfortunately necessary for the establishment of God's throne (fol to6v, following Isa 16:5). To understand what this means for Hazzan, we must digress to ask what Islam has meant for him up to this point. Let us make no mistake. His talk of "Grace"notwithstanding, Hazzan's at titude toward Islam is hardly one of ecumenical acceptance. Nearly every reference to Islam, up to this point in the text, has been unequivocally (126) Hazzan, like other Sabbatian writers,regularly uses the expression torathesed ("Torah of Grace") to refer to Islam, as opposed to torat emet ("Torah of Truth"),which isJudaism.He explains (fol.31v)that"the Ishmaelite religion is called torat hesed. . . inasmuch as the Ishmaelites have only that which their ancestors transmitted to them . . . they walk after vanity, yet do not aban don the practice of their ancestors." He implies that this loyalty of theirs, blind as it is,is nonethe less counted to them as a virtue (teed), which casts particular discredit on the Jews'correspond ing disloyalty to their own sacred tradition.(This interpretation is partly inspired by a midrashic interpretation of Prov 14:34, hesed le'ummim hattat, found in Tanhuma Ki Tissa #5.) Given Haz zan's generally contemptuous attitude toward Islam, expressed in this and other passages (be low),Scholem seems justified in refusing to infer from the torat hesed terminology that the Sab batian writers perceive Islam as a"religion of grace'/superior to Judaism : Sabbatai Sevi, pp.813, 863~64;"Perush mizmorei tehillim','pp.181-83(Liebes,pp.115-18); cf. the discussion in Liebes, "Yahaso shel Shabbetai Sevi le-hamarat dato','pp. 301-05(On Sabbateaism and its Kabbalah, pp. 3 2 - 33).Yetwe shall see that Hazzan evidently felt envy as well as scorn for Islam; and that,in his own crisis of faith, he found himself wondering if God and Abraham(the Kabbalistic embodiment of hesed hesed ) did not in fact prefer the Muslims over the Jews. The phrase torat hesed may indeed have contained within it some implication of Muslim superiority, which Hazzan and other Sabbat ian writers normally preferred to keep out of their conscious awareness.</page><page sequence="40">182 DAVID J.

But it is occasionally possible to detect another tone, of envy and longing, in Haz zan's allusions to Islam."W%0 set the mid assfree} [Job 39:5]. Who can bring out Ishmael, whom Scripture calls a wild ass of a man [Gen 16:12], and set him free? And who has opened the bonds of the wild ass?

Sav and Muhammad both have the gematria value of 92.( Is Hazzan aware that Muslim writers often called attention to the numerical value of Muhammad's name,equating it thereby with bi-me'od me'od in Gen 17:20, which predicts Ishmael's future great ness [ibid., p. 327, cf. p. 364; Perlmann, Ibn Kammuna's Examination of the Three Faiths, p. 139]? It is impossible to say.) In the same passage, Hazzan explains Leviticus's "mouse" (cakhbar) as "this Turkish king, for so he is explicitly called among the Jews in all regions of Constan tinople."(Per haps a play haps a play on Arabic akbarî) He was soon to speak more respectfully of the sultan, as we will see.

[demanding] that it be measured out and brought'.'135 Even as Hazzan scorns what he perceives as the aridity and baselessness of the Muslim religion, he envies its potency — expressed in an image that, given the context of Ezek 23:20,is blatantly sexual — and its worldly good fortune. It represents to him a world of security and power from which he remains banned, not so much by the Muslims themselves as by his own reli gious convictions."They are forbidden to us, and who can make them per mitted?"His implied answer seems to be: Sabbatai Zevi. A few pages before Ishmael first appeared on the scene, Hazzan had sketched a fantasy of how Sabbatai might bridge the worlds of Judaism and Islam, entirely to Judaism's benefit. Isa49:22-23, which promises that the Gentile kings and their princes will become nurses to the Jews, refers — says Hazzan — to the mighty works of Sabbatai Zevi. Isaiah's "princes" are "the celestial princes that are in charge of [the Gentiles], like Samael and Rahab; they will turn to you in great love and will nurse you." This is the hidden sig nificance of the mysterious "man" who, according to Gen 32:24-32, wresded by night with the patriarch Jacob. The"man" is Samael, here conceived as pa tron of the Muslims. The victorious "Jacob" is Sabbatai Zevi ."And he said, Send me me off136 [Gen 32:26] ; meaning, I am your slave and in your power, and I am your emissary"(fol 94r-v). This is, of course, fantasy. But not absolutely so. We learn from Cardozo, and from Hazzan himself, that Sabbatai had at least one Muslim devotee, a certain"MullahcAli," whom he in fact used as his emissary from town to town. In his commentary on the Aqedah, in connection with Abraham's cleaving the the woodfor the burnt-offering (Gen 2 2:3),Hazzan records a remarkable vignette of of Sabbatai's life in his Albanian exile. In 1674, evidently ,137Sabbatai had sent Mullah Mullah cAli as his messenger to the believers in Kastoria( Hazzan among them) en route to his prospective father-in-law (Aaron Majar) in Sofia."He told us about the passing of the Lady [matronita; that is, Sabbatai's wife they declare that they are in the right, for (they say)"Surely they have entered into our religion !" (135) Fol 82a. Hazzan's zahav yeraqraq, based on Ps 68:14, expounds ve-ahar kolyaroq yidrosh (Job 39:8). Medocl ve-have is taken from the exegesis of Isa 14:4 in BT Shabbat 14gb-150a. His overall portrait is somewhat suggestive of the very hostile account of Islam given by Judah del Bene, Kisse'ot le-vet David — published in Verona some thirty years before Hazzan wrote — as this is summarized in Steinschneider, Polemische und apologetische Literatur, pp. 384-85.(1 have not had access to Del Bene's book itself.)

And among the things he told us was that he [Sabbatai] would chop large pieces of wood, and give the small pieces to our Lord Ishmael to chop" (fol 107V). The details of this sketch, and the interpretation that Hazzan goes on to of fer of Sabbatai's behavior — he was training his son, the future Messiah, to "shatter and subdue the qelippot" in the form of pieces of wood — are (for now) less important to us than the role ascribed to Mullah cAli. A story transmitted by Cardozo confirms Hazzan's depiction of this role: in 1676, shortly before his death, Sabbatai sent Mullah cAli from Dulcigno to Edirne ( Adrianople) to summon two of his followers into his presence.139 The mythic act that Hazzan attributes to Sabbatai, of turning the once mighty angelic patron of Islam into his subservient messenger, thus reflects the actual role of Mullah cAli within Sabbatai's inner circle. We cannot be sure whether Hazzan built his myth upon his observations of Mullah cAli's behavior; or whether, as often tended to happen — the tragic story of Ish mael Zevi is an obvious example — Sabbatai had managed to turn his im mediate surroundings into a mirror of his Messianic fantasies. Either way, the rhetorical question that Hazzan had asked, in connection with Job 39:5, is now answered. The once"forbidden"Muslims have now become"permitted." Thanks to Sabbatai, they can be part of a new (and largely imaginary) "Jewish Muslim symbiosis,"140 in which the power relationships of the real Jewish Muslim symbiosis have become reversed. (138) Following Scholem, against Amarillo (above, n.24). The distinguished title matronita, long hallowed by the Zoharic practice of using it for the divine Female, would be entirely appro priate for Sabbatai's wife of many years. It is far less suitable for Majar's daughter, whom Sab batai twice planned to marry but who remained"his betrothed"(Jar«s(2to)at the time of her death (Tishby,"R. Meir Rofe's Letters,"p. 97). (139) Molho and Amarilio,"Autobiographical Letters" pp. 217-18. Scholem quotes and dis cusses the text from Hazzan in"Perush mizmorei tehillim" pp. 169-71 (Liebes, pp. 101-03). Ap parently, however, he did not notice that Hazzan gives the Mullah's name. (The initial letter cayincayin is clearly visible; the lamed andyod, though covered by the tape used to bind the manu script, can be read with certainty.) He therefore omits "cAli"from his quotation ; and this is why, as far as I am aware, subsequent scholars have failed to observe the important correlation be tween Hazzan's account and Cardozo's.The reference to Sabbatai's having"brought a dead per son back to life" is baffling. A letter written in the summer of 1675 quotes Sabbatai as having promised "soon" to bring his deceased ex-fiancee ( Majar's daughter) back to life, and Isaiah Tishby suggests that the mullah now reports the promise as having been fulfilled :"R. Meir Rofe's Letters,"Letters," pp. 96-97. This hypothesis, which requires us to date the episode a year or two later than Scholem did and to interpret its significance differently, does not seem to me compelling. Sabbatai's followers believed him to have resurrected many dead people ( Isaiah Sonne,"New Material on Sabbatai Zevi from a Notebook of R. Abraham Rovigo" [Hebrew], Sefunot 3-4(1960] 55), and we have seen that Hazzan expected Ishmael Zevi to do the same. On the role of the mul lah, cf. also ibid., p.62. (140) I use the familiar phrase of S.D.Goitein.</page><page sequence="43">[43] THE SON OF THE MESSIAH 185 Jacob Jacob/Sabbatai's triumph over his nocturnal antagonist, says Hazzan,rep resents a stage beyond his earlier achievement of "blessing and birthright." These latter were won by 'deceit' (mirmah) ; specifically, by the act of donning the turban. Now, however, Samael proclaims Jacob/Sabbatai's victory of his own free will, without compulsion.That is why, according to Gen 32:28, the victor is no longer"Jacob"but"Israel"(fol 94V). Hazzan reiterates much of this argument when he comes to expound Psalm 85, and thereby to define and describe the dual Jewish-Islamic path that Sabbatai and Ishmael have been obliged (by the command of Gen 22:2) to tread. He explains that the psalmist speaks of Sabbatai as "Jacob"141 because of the 'ruse' (coqvah) and 'deceit' (ramma'ut ) with which he has tricked the an gelic patrons of the Gentiles, as his Biblical prototype once tricked Esau. As Prov 25:21-22 instructs us to give our enemy food and drink in order to de stroy him ; as God once ordered the Israelites to provide a goat for the de mon Azazel as a ruse to deceive him;142so"the Light of Israel was obliged to enter into this testing,"in the profane realms of Islam (fol 105r-v). We are given one particularly striking example of what this dual path in volves. Hazzan quotes Prov 31:26 — She opens her mouth in wisdom, and tor at hesedhesed is on her tongue — which he takes as referring to Sabbatai.143 "He would often reveal, through his astounding wisdom, the mystery of [God's] divin ity, which had not been revealed even to the Prince of the Presence; and, concurrently, chant torat hesed — that is to say, the Qur'an of the Ishmaelite nation. . . two Torahs together" (fol îoyr)!44 "Grace" and "Truth"— torat hesed and torat emet, Islam and Judaism — have thus met together, as Ps 85:11 says. The effect is that righteousness and peace have kissed ; which Hazzan under stands, in Kabbalistic terms, to mean that the female and male aspects of di vinity have coupled. Thereupon"Truth" (Judaism),which has hitherto been (141) Ps 85:2 reads (according to the Qere) shavta shevit yacaqov. Hazzan points out thatshevit is an anagram for shabbetai, and interprets: she-ha-el be-rahamav yashiv et shabbetai yacaqov."S3b batai"and"Jacob"are thus equated. (142) So the Zohar's interpretation of the rite of Leviticus 16 (Isaiah Tishby, TheWisdom of the Zohar: AnZohar: An Anthology of Texts [London and Washington, 1989], vol. 2, pp. 453,521-23). Hazzan had used this illustration, as well as the citation of Prov 25:21-22, as part of his argument on fol 94V. The thought processes underlying fols 94V and 105r-v are plainly very much the same. (143) Since he is, as Hazzan often tells us, the inseparable companion of the Shechinah,to which standard Kabbalistic exegesis applies this verse. ( 144) Najara reports much the same : One Sabbath morning in Adar 1671, Sabbatai preached a sermon in a synagogue in which he"made known that many difficulties in our holy Torah and in the sayings of our sages are entirely unintelligible and insoluble without the preliminaries that he set forth. ... He extended this sermon for about two hours; and, at its conclusion, read from the Quran, in order to show that the whole point of his sermon was to bring them into this faith[ Islam ]"(Amarillo,"Tecudot Sh abbeta' iyyot " p. 2 5()).</page><page sequence="44">186 DAVID J. HALPERIN [44] wan wan ting,1145 will spring from the earth', and"Righteousness,"in the person of Sab batai Zevi, will look forth from heaven ( Ps 85:12) in a glorious"second coming" (fol 107r). The triumphalist quality of Hazzan's expectation is evident. Plainly enough, the Jewish-Islamic synthesis embodied by Sabbatai is no experiment in inter faith harmony, but rather a necessary trick used against a repellent and de spicable enemy. But here Hazzan finds himself caught in a paradox. For the trick to work — for "Jacob"eventually to vanquish the demonic patron of Is lam, so that the latter freely confesses his victory — Sabbatai must mold his Judaism in accord with the enemy faith. So must his son: his partner and vie tim in the new Aqedah. So So must Hazzan himself. In the act of reshaping the Aqedah, he opens it to the Islamic encroacher. The Jewish ancestor Isaac has practically vanished from Hazzan's reading of Genesis 22, leaving behind him little more than the symbolic implications of his name. In his place stands a"turban-wearing" Muslim Ishmael. Not, of course, the Muslim Ishmael. The Ishmael Zevi of Hazzan's Messi anic fantasy is still fundamentally identified with the Jewish people; he will emerge, no less than in the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century writers we considered in the preceding section,as Israel's advocate and savior; the Mus lims will be targets, rather than beneficiaries, of the salvation he will bring. So Hazzan anticipated. But, midway through the Aqedah, Hazzan must change course. Ishmael Zevi will himself vanish. He will be replaced — not by the Jewish Isaac, nor even by the sefirah Gevurah — but by the figure that Hazzan and his contem poraries regarded as the embodiment of Islam : Ishmael son of Hagar. Torat hesedhesed and torat emet will thus have met, on the former's terms; and the Aqe dah',46no less than Sabbatai Zevi himself, will have entered the realms of Islam. We shall examine this impending development in sections 7 and 8. Let us conclude the present section by comparing the Aqedah exegesis with which Hazzan began his midnight-vigil commentary (fol 14V; see above) with the new line of interpretation which, carried away by enthusiasm for the Messiah ship of Ishmael Zevi, he now unfolds. A few details have remained the same. The morning of Gen 22:3 is still the eschaton; the third day still alludes to the future resurrection. Abraham's ass is still, as in Abarbanel and Kohen, the beast to be ridden by the Messiah (Zech 9:9). But now it is further interpreted as"the prince of the nation"— (145) Following Mishnah Sotah 9:15. (146) Which Abarbanel (above) had described as"the entire strength of Israel, and their merit before their Father in heavenr</page><page sequence="45">[45] THE SON OF THE MESSIAH !87 the Muslim nation, presumably — and the Messiah's riding it as represent ing his triumph!47 The wood that Abraham cleaves no longer represents the sinners readied for punishment, but (perhaps along the same lines) the qe lippotlippot that the Messiah must shatter and subdue.(See above, on the story of Mullah Mullah cAli.) But the most important elements have shifted entirely. "Abraham" and "Isaac,"earlier the sefirot Hesed and Gevurah, now have become Sabbatai and Ishmael Zevi. Sabbatai has thus changed, as we saw at the beginning of this section, from"beloved son" to "exalted father" (or, perhaps,"bitter father"). The two young men, earlier Metatron and Sabbatai himself, now have become the" two high princes "who are to serve the Messiah as their Biblical proto types served Abraham. (They are later explicitly identified as Rahab prince of Ishmael and Samael prince of Esau ; that is, the angelic /demonic patrons of Islam and Christendom.) There are some new details. Commenting on 22:2,Hazzan writes :'1The land ofMoriah is the ,Holy Land' [that is, the seftrah Malkhut],!48 with whom you (147) "And he saddled his ass. This is the ass that he rode upon and triumphed over, in accord with the hidden meaning of poor, riding on an ass [Zech 9:9]; this is the prince of the nation, as is explained in the Zohar, Ki Tese, in Racya Mehemna, in connection with the hidden meaning of I have I have an ox and an ass [Gen 32:5]"( fo 1107V). I have not been able to locate the precise Zoharic passage to which Hazzan refers. Several passages understand the ox and ass to refer to demonic entities that Jacob had in his power (1,166b, II, 64b); or — a slight variation — take the ox to be the divine power of harsh judgment (th esefirah Gevurah) and the ass its demonic counterpart (I I, 6a, III, 86b-87a). Ill, 207a, identifies the ass with the totality of the demonic sefirot, and quotes Zech 9:9 to show that "King Messiah is destined to rule over it." The tenth of the additional tiqqunim,tiqqunim, printed as an appendix to the Zhitomir edition of Tiqqunei Zohar (1863, p. 147b; re printed Jerusalem, 1974), identifies the ox and the ass with"the patrons of Esau and Ishmael, whom the two Messiahs will ride and dominate . . . that is whyjacob said, I have an ox and an ass, for he dominated them. . . ."All of these passages are plainly relevant to Hazzan's purpose; the last particularly so, since it seems to warrant an equation of the ass with the patron of Ishmael. (This last interpretation of Gen 32:5 is followed by Israel Sarug, Sefer limmudei asilut [ Lemberg, 1850; reprinted Jerusalem, 1972], cols. 8c-d: Jacob intended to convey that Esau [ox] and Ish mael [ass] were subject to his power.) None of them, however, occurs in Ra'ya Mehemna on Ki Tese.(Tese.(Tese.(Zech 9:9 is twice quoted in this section — III, 276a and 279a — but neither of these pas sages suits Hazzan's allusion here, although the second shows considerable affinity with his Mes sianic thought in other parts of the commentary.) It is striking that many of the Zoharic texts that expound Gen 32:5 also expound Deut 22:10 (the prohibition of plowing with an ox and an ass together)in the same context; Ra'ya Mehemna on Ki Tese (Deut 21:10-25:19) would there fore be a logical place to look for a discussion of the ox and the ass. But Racya Mehemna on Ki Tese is evidently incompletely preserved, for it begins only with Deut 22:19. Did Hazzan have a fuller text at his disposal? Or did he regard the passage in III,86a-87a as having originally been a part of Racya Mehemna on Ki Tese, as the printer's note on III, 275b of the Mantua edition might indicate ? (148) This symbolic use of "Holy Land"occurs throughout Hazzan's commentary.

Hazzan's inspiration here is perhaps the Pentateuch commentary of Bahya ben Asher, which interprets le-colah in 2 2:2 to mean that Abraham was to of fer Isaac to"the tenth sefirah, which ascends" (la-middah ha-asirit ha-mitcalleh), to offer him, that is, to Malkhut}M If so, Hazzan has given the idea a signifi cant new twist. It is no longer Isaac who is to be offered (or, perhaps,"raised") to Malkhut, but Abraham/Sabbatai who will ascend with that sefirah™ The reference is surely to Sabbatai's"disappearance"and his consequent exalta tion. Isaac/Ishmael, by contrast, is to receive an unspecified"lofty rank"(ma calahcalah ha-celyonah) ; which, in the light of what we have already learned of his dawning Messianic glory (above, sec. 4), must be understood as bound up with his future as savior, judge, and ruler on this earth. Writing these words, Hazzan no doubt intended the details of Ishmael's Messianic elevation to unfold, on paper, as he brought his commentary on the midnight-vigil liturgy to its triumphant conclusion in the Aqedah. He expected them, no doubt, to unfold in reality not long afterward. 7. A Messiah Disappears This denouement was never to arrive, even in the commentary's own fantasy world. Instead, Ishmael Zevi was to vanish from its pages (and presumably from its author's hopes), and the commentary was to extend itself well be yond the Aqedah. Why? A"fresh start"is evident in the handwriting, in the tenth line of fol 108r. The content also changes at this point, more subtly but still perceptibly. Haz Palestine: fol 86v.)The goal of raising Malkhut to the higher sefirot — first to her "husband'' Tif' eret,eret,eret, with whom she couples; then with him to realms higher yet — is a Kabbalistic commonplace. ( 149) This is a thinkable understanding of ve-hacalehu sham le-colah, inspired by such Zoharic passages passages as II, 238b-23ga (Tishby, Wisdom of theZohar, vol. ;.;,pp. 923-27).The more usual trans lation is of course "offer him there for a burnt-offering." (150) Bahya ben Asher, Midrash Rabbenu Bahya (Jerusalem, 1988), pp. 108-og. Bahya goes on to find allusions to Malkhut in the altar of verse 9 and the ram of verse 13 (yesh bo remez li-keneset yisra'elyisra'el she-niqret ayyelet ha-shahar, p. no). Shifra Baruchson's research suggests that, at the end of the sixteenth century, Bahya's Pentateuch commentary was second only to Rashi's in popularity (above,(above, n. 86). It is therefore plausible to imagine that Hazzan is likely to have been acquainted with it. ( 151 ) Hazzan is emphatic that it is Sabbatai alone who will ascend with Malkhut: eres ha-moriy yah hi eres ha-qedoshah attah tifalleh cimmah.</page><page sequence="47">[471 [47] THE SON OF THE MESSIAH 189 zan backtracks, goes over ground he has just finished covering, making slight but significant alterations. He is uncharacteristically halting and unsure of himself. For the first time in his commentary, he shows respect and defer ence for Islam and the Turkish sultan; not on the ground that they are wor thier of respect than he once believed, but on the ground that they are plainly recipients of God's and Sabbatai's favor. Ishmael Zevi is still present after the "fresh start'.' Indeed, his elevation proceeds apace. But this elevation has the effect of declaring him equivalent to his dead father, and of dispatching him to the heights of the Kabbalistic pleroma; in which rarified atmosphere he disappears. My hypothesis is that, during the break in his composition marked by the "fresh start',' Hazzan learned that Ishmael Zevi was dead. The shifts in what follows are consequences of this unwelcome intelligence. The text itself is the best argument for this hypothesis. I translate the perti nent text, before and after the "fresh start','calling attention to some particu lar features ; and trusting that the reader will be struck, as I have been, by how much more naturally it reads once my hypothesis is granted. I begin with Hazzan's exegesis of Gen 22:5 (fol 108a). Then Abraham said unto his young men, who have been mentioned above,152 Abide ye Abide ye here with the ass. Our sages have interpreted this to mean, a peo pie pie resembling the ass153,' which corresponds to what I have said about the esoteric meaning of [the Messiah's being, according to Zech g:g] poor, riding riding on an ass.154 And And I and the lad will go yonder [cad /»/ij. This is the sefirah Malkhut, which is called koh'J" (152) And identified as the supernatural patrons of Christendom and Islam. (153) cAm ha-domim la-hamor; drawing upon a widespread midrash that reads cim ha-hamor as though it were cam ha-hamor, and consequently disparages Abraham's servants as "ass-people" (e.g., Gen.Rab. 56:2,Levi. Rah. 20:2,BT Yevamot 62a; cf. Yosef Heinemann, Aggadah and Its De velopmentvelopment [Hebrew; Jerusalem, 1974], pp. 12 2-29). In the light of the common aggadic identifi cation of the two "young men" as Eliezer and Ishmael (e.g., Levi.Rab. 20:2 ;Pirqe de-Rabbi Eliezer ch. 31, cited by Hayyim Kohen),it is possible to see in Hazzan's commentary a rehabilitation for Ishmael, which raises him from the company of the"ass-people"to the central role in the Aqedah. (154) That is to say, the Messiah is to dominate (ride upon) the"ass-like"patrons of the Gen tiles. The triumphalist quality of Hazzan's exegesis — prior to the"fresh start"— remains very marked. Cf. above, n. 147. (155) Cf. Bahya ben Asher's identification of ha-mizbeah, in verse 9, with Malkhut (above, n. 150). Both koh and mizbeah are familiar Kabbalistic representations for the tenth sefirah: Moses Cordovero, Pardes rimmonim (Munkacz, 1906; reprinted Jerusalem, 1962), Shacar cerkhei ha-kinnuyim; Eliyahu Peretz, Macalot ha-Zohar: mafieah shemot ha-sefirot (Jerusalem, 1987).</page><page sequence="48">igo DAVID J. HALPERIN [48] And And And we will prostrate ourselves. This alludes to the hidden meaning of [the Talmudic definition, according to which] "prostration"means the stretching out of the arms and the legs.156 And And we will come back to you. This is the hidden meaning of the passage, Israel prostrated Israel prostrated himself upon the head of the bed [Gen 47:31 ].157 And And And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son son [Gen 22:6].Thatis, he gave him some of the pieces of wood that have earlier been described,158 and set them upon him so that he might chop [the qelippot] and subdue them. And And And he took in his hand the fire. This refers to the harsh Gevurah [the se firah of judgment], which he needed at that time.159 So it is written, The (156) BT Berakhot 34b, Megillah 22b,Shevu'ot 16b,Horayot4a. The significance of the com ment is very unclear; see the following note. Does Hazzan intend some allusion to the prostra tions characteristic of Muslim worship, performed by Sabbatai and Ishmael Zevi? He remarks on fol 126r, apropos of Ps 143:6, that Muslims typically spread their hands when they pray; but the verb used is paras, as opposed to pishshut here. (157) It is very unclear what Hazzan has in mind. We may say with some confidence that, as often in his commentary, he intends "Israel" to be understood as Sabbatai Zevi. (He marks the word with two dots, showing he attaches some special significance to it.) It further seems likely that he understands the bed (ha-mittah) as Malkhut; see Cordovero, Shacar cerkhei ha-kinnuyim, and Jacob Jolies, Sefer qehillat yacaqov (Lemberg, 1870), s.v. This comment, and the two that precede, therefore belong together and must be interpreted together. Shall we suppose Hazzan is allud ing to the Zohar's exegesis of Gen 47:31 (1,225b, 226b), which understands the bed to be the sefi rah rah Malkhut, the head of the bed to be Yesod, and upon the head of the bed to be Tif'eret? "Israel"— Sabbatai Zevi, in Hazzan's reading — thus prostrates himself to himself (le-dideh qa saged), in that "IsraeP'is a designation for Tif'eret (that is, he worships the sefirah of which he himself is manifes tation). But then why is the comment attached to ve-nashuvah calekhem, and not to the preceding ve-nishtahavehve-nishtahaveh ? Alternatively, Hayyim Kohen's exegesis of ve-nashuvah (above, sec. 5) might lead us to suspect an allusion to an eschatological "return? We might link this to the citation of Gen 47:31 in BT Megillah 16b, which assumes that Jacob was prostrating himself to foseph( cf. Bahya ben Asher, ad loc.: kedei lahaloq kavod la-malkhut). The "hidden meaning"of the passage will then be : Sabbatai and Ishmael go to Malkhut, where Sabbatai transfers his authority to Ish mael; and the two of them thus return, in the living person of Ishmael, to redeem the Jews and execute judgment upon the Gentiles and the qelippot. This makes good sense, but still leaves un explained Hazzan's allusion to the Talmudic definition of "prostration? I can only speculate, without any confirming evidence, that Hazzan is coverdy alluding to Gen 49:33,va-ye'esof lyi a qov] raglavqov] raglavqov] raglav el ha-mittah, which seems to describe Jacob's death. The "stretching out of the arms and the legs"will then mark a reversal of this process, that is, a resurrection.(We recall that Haz zan credits both Sabbatai and Ishmael with the ability to resurrect the dead ; Mullah cAli has de scribed a feat of this sort on the immediately preceding page.) This posture is rather suggestive of the position the prophet Elisha assumes while resurrecting a dead child (II Kgs 4:34); and Elisha was at least once proposed as a"type"of Sabbatai Zevi: Yitshak R.Molkho,"A Sabbatian Commentary on Lekh-Lekha (Genesis 12-17)" [Hebrew],Sefunot3-4( 1960)453-56. Hazzan's in tent presumably lies somewhere within this network of allusions; precisely where, I cannot say. (158) In Mullah cAli's story (above).

That is why the text puts them on the same footing: And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father. And And he said, My father. This means : I already perceive myself to be my father [ani margish be-casmi she-ani avi]. His father answered the very same thing : He said, Here am I, my son — my rank is yours, my level of ele vation is yours.

This is what I said in my analysis of the passage, And they they went both of them together. (But it is not precisely what Hazzan had said in his analysis of the passage, And they went both of them together. There he had represented Ishmael's elevation as a future event. Now it is an accomplished fact. Why? Because Ishmael, like his father, is dead. Like his father, he is marvellously exalted in the next world; but, also like his father, singularly unhelpful in this one.) It is also possible to say as follows: And Abraham said unto his young men [Hazzan backtracks to 22:5]: these are Rahab prince of Ishmael and Samael prince of Esau, as I have already explained.

(But this is not quite as he had explained it above. He had said that Sabbatai would ascend with Malkhut, and that he and Ishmael would journey together to that sefirah. But that the two of them would together ascend along with Mai khutkhut is something new.) The hidden meaning of the passage, And we will prostrate ourselves and we will will come back to you, is that we will come back to you a second time. This means that they will yet again be obliged to enter their domain!66 Hence we we will come back to you, until the time and the dominion167decreed by God's wisdom has elapsed. (The point seems to be that Sabbatai and Ishmael — now inseparably paired ! — will reappear as Gentiles even at their "second coming." This doleful pre diction contrasts sharply with Hazzan's earlier confidence that Sabbatai's Is lam is merely a temporary expedient, part of the process of "mending.") For, in my own opinion, the Turkish king — or someone else from the spark of Ishmael son of Abraham — will have a high rank with Am i ra h even after the Revelation [that is, the second coming]. Perhaps he will attend him and minister to him; blessed is he who knows! For we have ourselves heard that Am ira h did not like for anyone to curse [the sul tan] ; and, at all events, it appears that the Ishmaelites [Muslims] will have some measure of rank with Ami rah. . . .[fol 108r] For the time being, at least, Hazzan has forgotten that he had once repre sented Islam as organized lunacy, that he had gleefully repeated the Con stanstantinople Jews' derogation of the sultan as the unclean"mouse"of Leviticus (above, n. 130). He now seems disposed to regard Islam as a divinely favored religion; favored, indeed, above Judaism. For he goes on to expound Deut 21:17 to mean that Ishmael, Abraham's first-born son by the hated Hagar, de serves the double portion — not only in this world, but even "at the revela tion of Am i rah's kingdom, inasmuch as the Light of Israel and its Holy One Islam, of whom Jacob/Sabbatai has made himself master.

The reference to"Occultation"— the normal Sabbatian euphemism for Sabbatai's death — is strange. Surely Hazzan meant to write gilluy "Revela tion" as he did earlier. His Freudian slip reflects his painful new awareness that Ishmael Zevi, too, has"disappeared." Only now is Hazzan able to return to the point from which he backtracked after his"fresh start,"and to take up the rest of Gen 22:7. Behold the fire and the wood;wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering? The fire, in Hazzan's reading, is still the sefirah Gevurah. But the wood is no longer the qelippot that little Ish mael had been learning to chop up, but the Gentiles. It appears that, Ishmael now disappearing from the picture, Hazzan is beginning to revert to the in terpretation of 22:3 he had given near the beginning of his commentary (fol 14V; above, sec. 6). As in his earlier exegesis, he calls the victims of the burning burning "dried-up trees" (ces1m yeveshim), and quotes Isa 33:12 in reference to them. As for the lamb for a burnt-offering (colah, the root meaning of which implies "ascent"), it is the Jewish people, who do not seem to have any visible merit by which they might be raised to the appropriate rank. God, therefore, will provide for it (Gen 22:8). The sefirah Binah, now appropriately "mended" by Sabbatai Zevi's powers, will be willing to redeem Israel on account of the Messiah's deeds and not their own. This is the meaning of the lamb for colah my son [22:8]. The lamb, which is Israel, will be raised on my account and yours; this is the meaning of my son.son. (Similarly, Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai said [to his son Eleazar] : You and I are sufficient I are sufficient to maintain the world.)16* So they went both of them together, mean ing that Israel will be redeemed by the merits of both. And And they came to the place [2 2:9] : the two of them, fused together [yahad[yahad[yahad be-yihudam],be-yihudam],be-yihudam], came to that place that is covertly indicated in the passage Blessed Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place [Ezek 3:12]. [fol 108v] Hazzan expounds the rest of verse g to refer to Binah's crowning of Sabbatai Zevi, his building up the structure of Malkhut (altar), his deciding which of the Gentiles (wood ) deserve to be burnt up and which may survive as Israel's servants (fols 108v-10gr).

These words are Hazzan's valediction to Ishmael Zevi. Equal to his father in merit, inseparably fused with him — which is to say, dead like him — Ishmael is honorably dismissed to the inexpressible heights of the sefirotic domain. He still exists as a supernatural entity, and if he could be in some way distin guished from his father (which he cannot) he might still be of some interest. As a human being, he is of no interest whatever. Even while describing Ish mael's last and loftiest exaltation, Hazzan does not call him by name. He will not mention him again. 8.The Redemption of Ishmael Who, then, is the little boy on Abraham's altar? Hazzan proceeds to explain. And Abraham And Abraham stretchedforth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son [et beno\ Gen 22:10]. [The word] et designates a ribbuy of beno [that is, that some thing else is intended, along with beno, as object of the verb lishhot ] ; the reference being to Ishmael,who is Isaac's ribbuy [which we might render, freely, as'Tsaac's double"or"Isaac's shadow"].170 His [Abraham's] intention was to say, [Ishmael] has already completely consumed his world, now let him perish from the world. And the angel of the the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said, Abraham, Abraham [22:11], twice; meaning, You are father to both of them!. . . And he said, Lay not thy thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing [me'umah] unto him [22:12]. Do not inflict a blemish [mum]111 on the kingdom of the house of David, which must rule over all the nations and all seventy of their princes,172 ( 16g) Isaiah Tishby provides a concise discussion of the colam ha-aqudim and its place within the complexities of Lurianic Kabbalah : Torat ha-rac ve-ha-qelippah be-qabbalat ha-Ari (2d ed. ; Jer usalem,1g84),pp.28-29.These details do not affect Hazzan's essential point, that the"binding of Isaac"really signifies the dispatch of Ishmael Zevi to the heights of the sefirotic realm.

For For now I know that thou art a God-fearing man, seeing thou hast not withheld thy thy son Ishmael, thine only son (for he is Isaac's ribbuy) from me, for he has now been perfecdy mended by Isaac, who is Ami rah. Both of them are to be called your sons, and your name is to be united173 with them . . . [fol 109a]. One stands in awe at the extraordinary boldness of this exegetical move. Hay yim Kohen, as we have seen, had made heavy use of the ribbuy technique in interpreting Genesis 22. Like Hazzan, he had included lishhot et beno among the chapter's ribbuyim. But Kohen had turned this"inclusion"into an indirect exclusion exclusion of the encroacher Ishmael :"[Isaac] was [Abraham's] single, solitary, unique son ; Ishmael was not called his son, inasmuch as he was the offspring of a Gentile slave woman!'Any Muslim claim on the Aqedah was thereby re pelled. Now, in what can be read only as a stunning and unprecedented ca pitulation to Islam, Hazzan draws precisely the opposite inference from this ribbuy ribbuy : "You are father to both of them !... Both of them are to be called your sons, and your name is to be united with them!' We may presume that "Abraham's" initial intent, to annihilate the Muslims once they had completed their enjoyment of their worldly prosperity (kevar hishlimhishlim le'ekhol colamo), corresponds roughly to Kohen's expectations of the fi nal judgment. It corresponds fairly exacdy to the more extreme revenge fan tasies of Hazzan's own triumphalist eschatology.174Now this intent is repudi ated. Ishmael son of Hagar, in whom the world of Islam is represented, has become the hero and focus of Hazzan's Aqedah. The"Isaac"of Genesis 2 2 thus undergoes a series of dazzling transforma tions.Up to this point, he has been understood to stand for Ishmael Zevi.He very briefly (in the passage just quoted) represents Sabbatai Zevi, by whom Ishmael / Islam is"perfectly mended"(nitqan tiqqun shalem)Vb Later on, he will come to stand for the Jewish people, an equation that seems natural and ap propriate for a Jewish commentator. And, in several crucial passages of Haz zan's Aqedah commentary, he is transformed into his brother Ishmael. (173) Yityahed, a play on the text's yehidekha. (174) Fol 57r-v; above, n.133. Hazzan subsequently comments that Sabbatai Zevi became like the Gentile desert and its qelippot that he had wanted to destroy (fol 118v, apropos of Ps 102:7); this confirms that Hazzan assumed Sabbatai's original purpose was to destroy "Ish mael."(The comparison of the Gentiles to dry trees links Hazzan's exegesis of Psalm 102 [fol118v top] to that of the Aqedah [fols 14V, 108v].) (175) The equation of Sabbatai with Abraham, however, remains in place throughout Haz zan's Aqedah commentary.</page><page sequence="54">196 DAVI D J. HAI.PE RI N [54] We recall that, in Isaiah Horowitz's reading of the Aqedah, Isaac "ceased to be" (nitbattel) in be" (nitbattel) in be" (nitbattel) in be" (nitbattel) in the course of the sacrifice, and was in effect replaced by anew and holier creature from on high. We may set Hazzan's Aqedah parallel to this. Ishmael Zevi similarly "ceases to be"— so we may regard his unexplained and permanent disappearance — and is replaced by the prototypical Mus lim Ishmael. It is clear, in any case, that the climax of Hazzan's Aqedah is the redemp tion of Ishmael ; who is normally (though not always)176 put on terms of equal ity with Isaac. Abraham/Sabbatai, who had initially planned to annihilate him, instead slaughters and burns up a harsh and persecuting people (the Ukrainian Cossacks, evidently) who are represented by the"ram'.'177By this act, Ishmael is redeemed (padah bo et yishmac'el). Because Because thou hast done (meaning, you have mended . . . )mthis thing, and hast hast not withheld (meaning, you have not allowed to walk in darkness)179 thy thy son, thine only son (the ribbuy of your son, the ribbuy of your only son, this being Ishmael) — as reward for this, with a blessing I will bless thee: two blessings, one for the one [Isaac, the Jews], one for the other [Ishmael, the Muslims]. And in multiplying I will multiply — two times — thy seed, whichever seed of yours it may happen to be, both of them being equally good. As the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore: the holy seed will be as the stars of the heaven ; and the second, which has entered beneath the Shechinah's wings, will be as the sand which is upon (176) In the passage quoted above, Hazzan represents Ishmael as one of the seventy nations to be ruled by the house of David. (177) Hazzan does not name this "harsh nation','although he later refers to it symbolically as "Amalek"(fol togv). His allusions to the Bible (Dan 8:5-8) and the midrash (Gen. R. 2:4 and par allels, especially Pesiqt.R. 33:11) suggest that he equates it with the Greeks. He cannot thereby intend Christendom as a whole; since both Edom and Ishmael (represented by Abraham's two "young men") later find their redemption. Contemporary sources, however, use yevanim to des ignate Greek Orthodox Christians; that is to say, the Ukrainians who perpetrated the horrors of 1648 (Jacob Katz,"Beyn tatnu le-tah-tat," in Halahhah and Kabbalah: Studies in the History ofJew ishish Religion, its Various Faces and Social Relevance [Jerusalem, 1984], pp.31 ]-30, esp. pp. 322-24). This would suit Hazzan's description of the'harsh nation"as persecuting and indeed proscrib ingjudaism ; as well as Nathan of Gaza's influential prophecy that, at Sabbatai's glorious advent, "there will be no slaughter among the uncircumcised"except in"the lands of Ashkenaz,"by which Poland and Russia are evidently meant (Scholem, Sabbatai Sevi, pp. 273,287-88, quoting Nathan's 1665 letter to Raphael Joseph ; cf.

(178) Hazzan supports his interpretation of casita by citing Gen 12:5, ha-nefesh asher casu, which the midrash had explained as referring to the"souls"converted to Judaism by Abraham and Sarah (e.g., Gen. Rab. 39:14). (179) Playing on hasakhta 'withheld'and hoshekh 'darkness.'</page><page sequence="55">[55] THE SON OF THE MESSIAH 1g7 the the the seashore. . . .

For Hazzan himself, however, the vision seems to have brought little but pain and grief. Never had he wished for or expected so mar vellous a prospect for Islam — that "twisted," "vain','mad, unclean religion, whose adherents"mock and ridicule us . . . devour IsraeF'and its wealth.180 He expresses his bitterness in an intense prayer, an appeal to the divine mercy, with which he closes his commentary on the Aqedah (fols îogv-iior). The prayer in question is a glossed and expanded version of two texts com binedbined : the ribbono shel colam prayer, recited in the daily liturgy immediately af ter the Aqedah[81 and Isa 63:15-16. It will be recalled that the latter passage was a part of the Lurianic tiqqun rahel, and one which the more conservative Sabbatian believers continued to recite even at the height of the Messianic enthusiasm of 1666.182 In his more somber moments, it would appear, Israel Hazzan might turn for inspiration to the sorrowful liturgy of the suppos edly outmoded tiqqun rahel. As the prayer unfolds, Hazzan reminds the deity that he has justly pun ished the Jews by making them jealous with a non-people ... a vile nation (Deut 3232:21 ),whom he has brought near to himself and into whose religion he has compelled the Jews to enter. (They deserve to be destroyed for this apostasy, Hazzan says — divinely appointed though it is, tiqqun though it is.) This goy naval naval 'vile nation' is the gay lavan 'white nation,' so named for the white tur ban that is its marker.183 Now, he implores, let the divine attribute of Mercy (180) Above, sec. 6. (181) Birnbaum, Daily Prayer Book, pp. 21-24. Hazzan's Aqedah commentary is thus intro duced and concluded by the two prayers (zokhrenu be-zikkaron tov and ribbono shel colam) that frame the liturgical recitation of the Genesis passage; see above, n. 121.

HALPERIN [56] launch an attack upon that turban!84God surely cannot have lost his zeal for his great name; which, with the Messiah's conversion, has become profaned among the nations ?185He surely cannot have reined in his yearning love for his people? For God — says Hazzan, quoting Isa 63:16 — is the only merciful father left to the Jews .'Abraham does not know us: he offered prayer after prayer on Ishmael's behalf, till [or, perhaps,"while"] our spirits had sunk to the dust186 through the painful trials inflicted on us by all Deuteronomy's curses.The Bib lical text of course does not mention Isaac, he being the sefirah of Gevurah —— but even Abraham the merciful does not know us. And Israel, who knows the pain of bringing up children, does not recognize us!' Only God remains. "Israel," as often in Hazzan's commentary, no doubt represents Sabbatai Zevi.187"Abraham"is perhaps also Sabbatai (as throughout the Aqedah); per haps the sefirah Hesed (which is the focus of Hazzan's prayer) ; perhaps the Bib lical patriarch himself. Most likely, he is an amalgam of the three. As Hazzan realizes to his sorrow — as many Jewish observers about the year 1680 may have realized to their sorrow — this "Abraham" seems oblivious to the an guish of his faithful. His thoughts and prayers are for Ishmael alone!88 (184) Ve-Cattah yagollu pe[rush] ha-senif ha-megulgal ke-galgalyitgolel calav middat ha-rahamim ve zehuyagolluzehuyagollu rahamekha cal middotekha — a brilliant and nearly untranslatable series of plays on the root gll.

Gen.R. 55:1, which commends Abraham for his willingness to sacrifice his son ahar kol ha-sacar ha-zeh; that is, the pain of begetting a child at age one hundred. (I quote the text of the standard edi tion, which is the text Hazzan is likely to have known,in preference to that of Theodor and Al beck.) But it is worth remembering that, according to Jacob Najara, Ishmael Zevi was given the name"Israel"at his circumcision (above, sec. 2). (188) There is perhaps an anticipation of this point in Hayyim Kohen's Torat hakham (vol. 1, col.col. 39b), which seems to maintain that it is Abraham's prayers that bear the responsibility for Islam's triumphs. Kohen starts from BT Pesahim 119b, which represents Abraham as refusing to say the blessing at the eschatological feast, on the ground that'Tshmael came forth from mer He explains this by misquoting BT Shabbat 8gb, to the effect that the Jews do not want to turn to Abraham"who prayed 0 that Ishmael might live before you!

If we are to appreciate Hazzan's treatment of this peculiarity, we must read it against the midrash on this verse in BT Shabbat 8gb: Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said in the name of Rabbi Johanan : What is the meaning of the text, For you are our father. For Abraham does not know us us and Israel does not recognize us. You, Lord, are our father and redeemer; your name name has existed eternally. God is going to say to Abraham,"Your children have sinned against me." And [Abraham] answers him,"Master of the universe, let them be wiped out for the sake of your name's holiness."

[The Jews] burst out, You [Isaac] are our father! Isaac says to them,"In stead of praising me, praise God." And Isaac indicates God to them with his eyes.189 Whereupon they lift their eyes to heaven and say, You, Lord, are our father and redeemer;your name has existed eternally. batai Zevi's followers attached particular significance to the blessing of Ishmael in Gen 17:20. Jacob Najara represents Sabbatai as twice quoting it in the sultan's presence,in the context of in ducingjews to convert to Islam ( Amarillo"Tecudot shabbeta' iyyot mi-ginzei Rabbi Sha' ul Amar illo," pp. 255,259-60). Abraham Cuenque, writing about 1690, tells a fantastic story of how the sultan puts his finger on that verse in Sabbatai's copy of the Bible, and begs Sabbatai to explain it to him."That" says Sabbatai,"represents your power of survival. It is on the strength of that verse that you [plural] have obtained dominion'.' Sabbatai explains the verse at length, whereat the sultan bursts into tears (Jacob Emden, Torat ha-qena'ot [Amsterdam, 1752 ; reprinted Jerusalem, 1971 ],p. 20a).Muslim controversialists had in fact made substantial use of Gen 17:20,pointing out that its words bi-me'od me'od have the gematria value of Muhammad; see above, n. 130.

His reference to Ja cob's"pain of bringing up children'all but guarantees his awareness of it.190 His predecessors, Isaiah Horowitz and Hayyim Kohen, had drawn upon it for their own homiletics (above, sec. 5). They had been prepared to accept the Talmud's assurance that Isaac is not indifferent to his children's fate; that, when the Jews are threatened by God's just anger, he will shield them with an audacious and witty defense that rests ultimately upon his own self-sacrifice at the Aqedah. But Hazzan will have none of this. The contrast between the sprightly op timism of the Talmudic aggadah,and the forlorn melancholy of his own mid rash, could not be sharper. For Hazzan, Isaac is absent from the Biblical text because there is not even a shadow of hope that this representative of harsh GevurahGevurah might show mercy. We recall that an earlier "Isaac"of Hazzan's imagination, Ishmael Zevi,was said to have been called"Isaac"because"he was born in a time in which the dinimdinim had the upper hand over the hasadim" and therefore "came into the world turban-wearing."Is it too much to imagine that Hazzan's reflection,on the disappearance of Isaac from the Isaiah verse, may be his last look back at his vanished child-Messiah — the unredeemed and now forgotten victim of the Sabbatian Aqedah? 9. The Evidence ofYakhini and Cuenque I am aware that my interpretation of the"fresh start"on fol 108a,as I have laid it out in the past two sections, has involved considerable speculation. Some readers may therefore hesitate to accept it. But I would remind those readers that it is not speculation that Ishmael Zevi appears unexpectedly in Hazzan's commentary, rapidly swells in importance until he becomes a Messianic fig ure overshadowing Sabbatai Zevi himself, and then abruptly vanishes, never to be mentioned again. (Approximately one-fifth of the commentary remains after the Aqedah is finished.) To account for this phenomenon, we have no choice but to posit that Ishmael disappointed Hazzan's expectations in some manner so drastic and terrible that Hazzan could find no way to speak of it, and therefore chose silence.191 An adult, perhaps, might have accomplished (igo) He may also, of course, have been aware of On./f.f&gt;7:7 (Theodor-Albeck [ed.J.pp. 76:2 73 ) ; which,unlike the Talmud, represents Isaac's absence from Isa 63:16 in a very unsympathetic light. The fact that he preferred a negative understanding of Isaac's absence, over the positive interpretation with which he was certainly familiar, continues to demand explanation. (191) We may compare the Sabbatians' initial reaction to the news of Sabbatai's death: Scholem, Sabbatai Sevi, pp. 918-19.</page><page sequence="59">[59] the son of the Messiah 201 this by publicly and vehemently repudiating the role that had been thrust upon him. But what could a ten- or eleven-year-old boy have done that would have had such an effect, other than to die? Once one grants that Hazzan must have learned of Ishmael's death in the course of writing his commentary, one can hardly balk at the idea that even slight irregularities in Hazzan's writing — by which I mean his handwriting as well as his discourse — may be clues to the momentous impact this discov ery must have had on his thinking. This proposition, of course, can be easily discontinued. If anyone should discover a single unambiguous and reliable reference to Ishmael's being alive after 1680, my entire reconstruction will collapse; and we will be left rack ing our brains for some other solution to the puzzle presented by Hazzan's commentary. If Meir Benayahu is right that Ishmael Zevi and the Sarajevan rabbi Isaac Zevi are one and the same, my view at once stands refuted; since Benayahu has shown that Isaac Zevi lived at least until 1716. But Benayahu could find no direct evidence for his identification; and, alluring as it unquestionably is, it suffers from a number of implausibilities that make it nearly impossible to accept. (See the Excursus.) The longevity of Isaac Zevi is therefore of no relevance to us. There remain two pieces of post-1680 evidence: an allusion to Ishmael Zevi in Abraham Yakhini's Vavei ha-amudim{\681 )]92 which Scholem andBena yahu understood to mean that Ishmael was still alive ; and the references to Ishmael at the end of Abraham Cuenque's hagiography of Sabbatai Zevi. These data now demand our attention. Vavei Vavei Vavei ha-amudim survives in only one manuscript: the author's autograph, MS Oxford Bodley Heb. c.2 (no. 2761 in Neubauer's catalog).193 It has never been published, little studied. I cannot claim to have read more than a frac tion of this sprawling text, and therefore must be somewhat tentative in my interpretation of the passage that concerns us. I think it clear, however, that the passage does not imply that Ishmael Zevi is still alive. It suggests, if any thing, the opposite. (192) Scholem argues for the date of the text as follows: On fol tir, col. 2, Yakhini gives the current year as [5)441 (fe-s/1atta da de-saleq hushban purqanah [פורקנה]); and, on fol tov, col. 2,re cords a dream which he dates to 25 Nisan. Hence the terminus a quo.The terminus ad quern is the beginning of 5442 (autumn 1681),when Yakhini died. See Scholem,"Perush mizmorei tehillim," p.p.208,n.58(Liebes,p. 106,misrepresents Scholem's citation of the manuscript); cf.Scholem, "Two New Theological Texts by Abraham Cardozo" [Hebrew],Sefunot 3-4(1960)248.

HALPERIN [60] The central theme of Yakhini's book is the peculiarity that Exod 35:8-9, which seems at first glance a verbatim repetition of 25:6-7, in fact contains three occurrences of the letter vav that are absent from the earlier passage.194 This slight variation takes on weighty significance when one recalls a rabbinic midrash on Exod 25:3-6(Yakhini attributes it to marei de-aggadta),according to which the oil for the light of verse 6 is a prophetic reference to the Messiah!95 Yakhini infers that, following the sin of the golden calf, Moses chose to add three vav s to this text foreshadowing the true Messiah; and he proceeds to explore every conceivable Biblical and Kabbalistic association that might shed light on the mystery of the triple vav. Among his myriads of possible associations, Yakhini proposes a linking with the three vav s of Gen 16:15: nc^ Hagar bore a son to Abram, and Abram called the the name of his son, whom Hagar had borne to him, Ishmael.196 There is a precious mystery here. For it is written, And Abraham gave all hehad[etkolasherlo]toIsaachehad[etkolasherlo]toIsaac [Gen 25:5].The hidden referent of Isaac is the Messiah, inasmuch as laughter for all the world is [to be found] there. He gave to him [that is, to Sabbatai Zevi] et kol (the numerical value ofIsh mael)ashermael)asher 10 (536, [the numerical value of] Zevi [obtained by the tech nique] of milluyf.:97 [That is, et kol asher 10=Ishmael Zevi. ] The Messiah was thus given a son whose name was Ishmael; and he [Sabbatai] wished that he [Ishmael] be mended through a supernal mystery, as we saw with our own eyes the mystery of the Mending of the son of our master Sabbatai Zevi through the light of Supernal Wisdom. This is the mystery of those three vav s in the verse, And oil for the light [Exod 35:8], mystery of the true Messiah. For anyone who has the eyes of the lofty faith of our master, the mystery of the three vavs of the verse, And And Hagar bore [Gen 16:15], will be well illumined by the verse of the Messiah [that is,Exod 35:8]. This is why the years of the life of Ishmael [Gen 25:17] are written in the Torah. And in the aggadah he is called his fruit ■will he yield in its time,198 while Isaac is called his leaf [Ps 1:3] ; for he [Ishmael? or Isaac?] is the mys (194) Ve-shemen in place of shemen, u-vesamim in place of besamim, ve-avnei shoham in place of av neinei shoham( fol 31•, col. 2).

Scholem reads it, naturally enough, as sevi, and glosses it to mean that"his full name is Ishmael Zevi." He would presumably have translated the passage into English : "The Messiah was thus given a son whose name was Ishmael, and he was Zevi." Scholem's reading has the obvious advantage that it is natural to assume that, in an explicitly Sabbatian text, the word צבי is apt to be Zevi. But it has some formidable disadvantages. Bar shemeh yishmacel ve-ihu sevi seems a need lessly verbose and awkward way of making the point that Ishmael's name was Zevi. Why not just say,"a son whose name was Ishmael Zevi"? And why would Yakhini, writing when Ishmael either was alive or had been dead for only a year or two, need to make this point at all? The de- of de-yittaqan is, on Scho lem's reading of the text, very difficult to understand. Surely we would expect ve-yittaqanve-yittaqan or ve-ihu yittaqan. All of these problems disappear if we vocalize savei, and understand this as the masculine singular participle of the verb meaning "to wish'.'201 The "mending"— or perhaps we should understand,"perfection"— of Ishmael (1gg) De-ihu raza de-or me-reshef [נ1רשפ] gevurah.l am not certain whether the fourth word is to be read as singular or plural.The use of the medial j!« does not exclude the reading me-reshef, since Yakhini often (though not uniformly) uses medial pe at the end of words. On the other hand, he often writes final yod as an unobtrusive hook attached to the preceding letter, so me-rishpei is also possible, although I confess that in this case the yod is so unobtrusive as to be undetectable. The plural reading better suits the content of the passage, since the phrase is best understood as alluding to Song 8:6 (reshafeha rishpei esh) and the Zoharic passages that expound it (1,244b 245a; II, 114a; Tiqqunei Zohar 1 [Zhitomir, [ed.] p. 18a]). Assume the familiar Kabbalistic identifi cation of esh with the sefirah Gevurah, and the equation rishpei esh=reshef/rishpei gevurah yields it self naturally.

HALPERI N [62] Zevi will then no longer be a future event anticipated by Yakhini(as Scholem seems to have understood the passage), but something that Sabbatai Zevi had wishedwishedfor during his lifetime. He had perhaps performed some sort of tiqqun rit ual, witnessed by Yakhini and others, in order to"mend"or "perfect" his son "through the light of Supernal Wisdom!'(By this,Yakhini presumably means the light that shines into this world through the holy "oil" that, in accord with his understanding of Exod 35:8,is Sabbatai himself.)202 What shall we make of the allusions in Yakhini's last paragraph ? Without a clear understanding of Yakhini's Kabbalistic system, which I do not at pre sent possess,any interpretation is bound to be uncertain. Yet it is striking that Gen 25:17, with which the paragraph begins, speaks of the death of the Bibli cal Ishmael ; and that Song 8:6, to which to which Yakhini surely alludes when he speaks of "the flame[s?] of Gevurah" (above, n.199),is saturated with death imagery. This will permit the conjecture that, when Yakhini cites the mid rashic exegesis of piryo yitten be-itto as referring to Ishmael, he is reflecting that the Messiah yielded up the fruit of his body to death, in its proper time203 What prompted Yakhini to introduce this reference to the deceased Ish mael Zevi? Recall that, according to our best evidence, Ishmael was born in Nisan 1668 (above, sec. 2); recall that the Biblical Ishmael was circumcised at age thirteen (Gen 17:2 5 ) ; recall that this typological precedent was impor tan t enough to Nathan of Gaza that he prophesied Sabbatai's son Ishmael would undergo a symbolic blood-drawing at that age. We may guess that some at least of the Sabbatian faithful had great expectations — bound up with the ever fascinating subject of Ishmael's penis — of what would happen when the son of their Messiah turned thirteen.That momentous birthday will have fallen in Nisan 1681,perhaps no more than a month or so before Yakhini wrote the pas sage we have been considering.204 Only, the hero of the occasion was dead. The calendar's reminder, of how the believers' hopes had once again met with ironic frustration, may well have evoked sad reflections in Yakhini. His thoughts may well have turned to the one whom Sabbatai Zevi had wished to be perfected through the sefirotic light that streamed through him ; but who, like the fruit of Ps 1:3,had to be yielded up in his season. (202) Cf. fol 31־,col. 1: Ve-shemen la-ma'orda mashiah ben davidshemen nehiru de-hokhmahcilla'ah. It seems reasonably clear from the context of fol 3r that Yakhini uses hokhmah cilla'ah in the tech nical Kabbalistic sense of the sefirah Hokhmah.l am unable to say whether he makes any distinc tion between hokhmah cilla'ah and hokhmeta Hlla'ah. Scholem's gloss on the passage referring to Ishmael, (she-hayah mehunnan) be-or ha-hokhmah ha-celyonah, seems unwarranted. (203) Cf. the use of be-itto'm]ob 5:26. (204) Above, n. 192.1 see no reason why Yakhini could not have written the forty-five folio pages that separate the date "2 5 Nisan"from the Ishmael passage in two or three weeks. The writing has a hasty, ill-planned, stream-of-consciousness quality that suggests it was done very rapidly.</page><page sequence="63">[63] THE SON OF THE MESSIAH 2O5 This leaves the testimony of Abraham Cuenque. The crucial passage occurs at the very end of his account of the life of Sabbatai Zevi.205After a string of fanciful stories about Sabbatai's death, and about the wonders and the won drous death of Nathan of Gaza, Cuenque reverts to Sarah (sic) and Ishmael : Sarah,Sabbatai Zevi's wife,dwelt in the king's palace,bringing up her son Ishmael. The lad grew, and took his father's place, associating with all the dignitaries of the kingdom, a young man like a cedar-tree.206I have heard from reliable sources that Ishmael is expert, beyond belief, in all wisdom and knowledge. If the scholars are in doubt about any matter, they seek out his opinion and he responds to everyone who asks [yidreshu et pivet pivet piv u-meshiv le-khol shoel]. I saw with my very own eyes, while I was in the city of Ostrog and vis iting the ga'on Rabbi Naphtali, nr-v (who currently holds the rabbinic position in Posen)207that there was an important scholar there named Rabbi Ephraim who had been born in Ostrog but had gone to study To rah in the Jewish metropolis of Salonika; and he showed me a query of Ishmael Zevi's and his lofty reply, matters exceedingly deep. This I saw with my own eyes; and there are many similar things. There seems no doubt that Cuenque,writing about 1690, represents Ishmael Zevi as still alive, hobnobbing with Ottoman dignitaries in the sultan's palace, and answering scholars' inquiries on the basis of his incredible erudition. (The verbs yidreshu and meshiv might conceivably describe habitual action in the past, but they are far more naturally rendered in the present tense.) Apropos of Ishmael's erudition, Cuenque describes an encounter with one "Rabbi Ephraim"; who produced a document,evidently emanating from Sal onika,onika, which purported to be a"query"of Ishmael's and his own reply to it {she'elah{she'elah mi-yishmac:&gt;el sevi u-teshuvato ha-ramah). Benayahu has dated this en counter to 1688 or 1689, and has identified the man Cuenque met as Ephraim Kohen of Ostrog, whose biography Benayahu describes in some detail.208 What are we to make of this? It will not do to suppose,as Scholem does, that Ishmael had died years before but that Cuenque was unaware of this because (2c&gt;5) Preserved in Emden, 70raf ha-qenaot, pp.16a-21b.The passage quoted is on p. 21b.

Now, the reader will have already noted one glaring inaccuracy in Cuen que's account. Sarah, who in reality died years before Sabbatai,210is repre sented as having oudived him.This is only one of a string of distortions. Writ ing only a few years earlier, Baruch of Arezzo had been perfectly well aware that Sabbatai's journey to Albania at the beginning of 1673 was an exile im posed by the sultan; although, naturally, he tried to put the best face on it he could.211Not so Cuenque. It was Sabbatai, he assures us, who demanded to strike out on his own,far away from the great cities of Islam; and he sternly held to this purpose, despite the grovelling pleas of his royal devotee.212He insists, moreover, that Sabbatai left Sarah and Ishmael behind in the sultan's palace, where they remained after his death. Yet he must have known better. Meir Rofe had learned in 1677 (from Gan door) that Elijah Zevi had brought Sabbatai's widow and his children from Al bania to Adrianople after Sabbatai's death?13 Rofe and Cuenque were col leagues in Hebron at the beginning of 1682?14 Surely it would have been easy (20g) "Barukhyah rosh ha-shabbeta'im be-Saloniqi," in Liebes, Researches in Sabbateanism, p.p. 364 n. 144. (210) Whether one accepts Scholem's or Amarillo's reconstruction of the chronology of Sab batai's marriages (above, n. 24). (211 (211 ) Freimann,cInyanei Shabbetai Set«, p. 66. Baruch is also aware that Sarah died and that Sab batai remarried; although he seems to date her death to the last months before Sabbatai's exile, and to connect it with Sabbatai's suit of Aaron Majar's daughter and with the death of the latter woman.(He reports the event immediately after quoting a letter dated 18 Av 5432 = 11 August 1672.) Since I follow Scholem's identification of Hazzan's matronita with Sarah (above, n. 138), I am obliged to see this as an error on Baruch's part, and I believe the error arose as follows: Baruch knew, i.that Sabbatai had originally sought to marry Majar's daughter while he was in Adrianople; 2. that he was not married to Sarah at the time; and 3. that Sarah had died not only before Sabbatai, but also before any subsequent marriage of his and before the death of Majar's daughter. What Baruch did not know was that Sabbatai and Sarah had briefly been di vorced in 1671, and that this was when Sabbatai had made his first advances to Majar (following Jacob Najara). He therefore conflated Sabbatai's original suit of Majar's daughter (1671) with his resumption of it (1674), and drew the conclusion that Sarah and Majar's daughter had both died while Sabbatai was still in Adrianople. This very natural and reasonable error is of an en tirely different order of magnitude from the gross distortions perpetrated by Cuenque. (212) "He said to the king, I want to leave this place. The king was very upset, and said to him, Won't Won't you tell me what you are lacking in my palace? Whatever you wish will be done for you. Sabbatai Zevi replied: I do not lack anything, but I must tell you in all truth that I can no longer endure this irk some some inactivity. Let me be on my own!" etc. (Torat ha-Qena'ot, p. 20b).

In retailing these stories, he cannot have been acting in good faith?13 We may assume, therefore, that he was writing deliberately to mislead when he wrote of Ishmael Zevi. He never says unambiguously that Ishmael is alive ; he does not add after his name any formula like nr-v (as he does for Naph tali Katz, his host in Ostrog) or yr-h ; he expresses no hope or prophecy that Ishmael will step into his father's place as savior. He is trying to have it both ways. The less well-informed among his readers, who have not heard of Ish mael's death, will naturally assume that the Messianic line is still thriving in the Turkish court, and will take heart from that. Yet Cuenque's language is vague enough that those who know Ishmael is dead will not be able to con vict him of a lie. What of the document he allegedly saw in Ostrog? Even if we assume he is telling the truth, it is striking that he says nothing about the contents of this "query of Ishmael Zevi's and his lofty reply, matters exceedingly deep'.'He ev idently cannot remember what the query and reply were about, or else does not not thinkitis worth communicating. Whateveritwas — perhaps some school boy exercise, dating from Ishmael's brief stay in Salonika as a pupil of Joseph Filosoff,Filosoff, which Ephraim Kohen had kept as a memento? — it does not seem to have made any great impression on Cuenque at the time he saw it. In ret rospect.ofrospect.of course,he is eager to play up its importance. We are not obliged to follow him. Nor are we obliged to take this supposed document as proof that Ishmael had become a great talmid hakhamim, or that he lived much past his eleventh birthday. We have thus weighed the two bits of evidence that have been adduced to show that Ishmael Zevi lived into the 1680s, and have found both of them wan ting. The first has been misinterpreted by modern scholars ; the second is a deliberate falsehood. The Sabbatians had remained silent about Sabbatai's death for as long as they possibly could?16 When Ishmael died, their silence remained unbroken. We find his death explicitly mentioned more than seventy years after the event, in one of a long series of hostile glosses that Jacob Emden attached to Cuenque's hagiography when he published it in his Torat ha-qena'ot (1752)?'' "R. Meir Rofe's Letters of 1675-80 to R. Abraham Rovigo" [Hebrew],Sefunot 3-4(1960) 127-28. (215) Even if we suppose that Cuenque innocently misidentified Sabbatai's widow as Sarah, he cannot possibly have stated without duplicity that she had never left the sultan's court. (216) Scholerti,Sabbatai Sew, pp. 918-19. (217) Scholem (ibid., p. 935) attributes these glosses to Moses Hagiz. But I believe this rests on a misreading of Emden's statement,in his preface to Cuenque's narrative, that Hagiz had"noted a</page><page sequence="66">208 david j. halperin [66] Emden cannot let stand Cuenque's glowing portrait of young Ishmael Zevi. Not so, he tells us; rather, Sabbatai's offspring turned out just like himself; the im pure pure birth died an Ishmaelite; and Sabbatai Zevi and his worthless lineage were cut off without without any survivor (p. 21 b ). Emden extends this observation with a malicious jingle, patched together from several Biblical verses (e.g., Job 18:1g),its point the utter and exemplary extermination of all Sabbatai Zevi's offspring. This is, as far as I know, the earliest specific reference to Ishmael Zevi's death. The child-savior's enthusiasts having left him wordlessly to slide into oblivion, it remained for his enemies to write his epitaph. 10. After the Aqedah And what will become of Israel Hazzan, now that Ishmael Zevi is gone? Im mediately after the end of the prayer that concludes Hazzan's Aqedah (above, sec.8),the handwriting marks a"fresh start"(fol 1 torj.The Aqedah,which Haz zan had evidently planned to be the climactic ending of his commentary on the Sabbatian tiqqun hasot, is past; Hazzan has been cheated of whatever sal vation he had anticipated. After a hiatus of unknown length, he returns to his composition, taking up a fresh series of Biblical passages that did not form part of the tiqqun hasot. Were it not for the fact that this portion of the commentary contains a cross-reference to an interpretation of 1 Sam 2:1-10 (fol 114V) — which shows that Hazzan felt obliged to say something about this text, but excused him self on the ground that it had already been expounded elsewhere — I would have assumed that these additional passages were of his own choosing. As it is, I can only suppose that they are drawn from some other liturgical sequence which I cannot now identify (above, n. 53). The series certainly begins appro priately enough with Job 28:3, the context of which Hazzan takes as refer ring to Israel's times of exile : He has put an end to darkness. Hazzan's Messianic hope revives, though Ishmael Zevi is of course no longer any part of it.Islam gradually slides from the amazing grace that,in the depth of his despair, Hazzan had attributed to it. Not long after beginning this sec tion of the commentary, he sets forth a remarkable theory, based on what seems to be a misinterpretation of Nathan of Gaza, to the effect that the Mus lims' purpose in washing their hands and feet before prayer is to use the wa ter to knead the dust of their feet into agotem.They use this golem"to make a few items"in the margins of the text,"and we have presented his statements, in his name,each in its proper place"(70rat ha-Qena'ot, p. 16a).Sure enough, a few of the glosses are introduced by Hagiz's initials (e.g., p. 18a, where Emden quotes a suggestion of Hagiz's and then offers a long response to it, introduced by the words amar ha-meqanne).Where these initials are absent, as is normally the case, we must assume that the gloss is Emden's own.</page><page sequence="67">[67] THE SON OF THE MESSIAH 209 connection"— with supernal entities, evidently.218 This, Hazzan quotes Na than as saying, was Abraham's purpose in wanting to wash the dust from the feet of his Arab visitors :"so that they could recline under the tree [Gen 18:4], the Tree of Life, our holy Torah"(fols. nov-111v).219In this passage, the Mus (218) Fol 111r: ke-she-hem rohasim yedehem ve-raglehem le-sorekh ha-namaz shellahem histakkel ve tir'eh tir'eh she-adayin yedehem sheruyim be-mayim ve-hem macavirim otam cal gabbei mincalehem kedei le-gabbel ha-avaqha-avaq she-cal raglehem she-ha-nir'eh be-vadday ha-gamur she-kawanatam ligbol et ha-avaq ha-hu kedei kedei lacasoto golem le-hitqassher bo. ( On the use of namaz for Muslim prayer, see Amarillo "Tecudot shabbeta'iyyot,"p.255•) He goes on to quote Nathan as follows : gam perce hu efer ha-metamme'ah et ha-tehorimha-tehorim kavvanatah hi lihyot golem resonah le-hitqassher cim neshamot aherot she-yesh bahem mi-qav hayosherhayosher ahar she-modiaclahem koah celyon[koah ketercelyon, i.e. Sabbatai Le\i}]elohuto shel ha-melekh shelomohshelomoh u-gedullat cillat ha-Mot lihyot hitcorerut le-taqqen ha-shevarim u-le-hacalotam mi-shamkikol cod she-hem she-hem sham has ve-shalom en tequmah le-yisra'el ligga'el. Nathan seems to use golem as he usually does,for the chaotic and formless materials that dominate the lower half of the tehiru(the space left by the contraction of the En Sof), where the light ray (qav ha-yosher) emitted by the/in .So/has not penetrated.(See Scho\em,Sabbata1 Sevi, pp.299-312 ; Chaim Wirszubski,"Ha-te'ologiyah ha shabbeta'itshel Natan ha-cA/ati" Keneset 8[ 1944(22 7-30.) It is this golem itself, which Nathan ap pears here to equate with Islam, that seeks connection with souls (in the upper part of thetehiru?) that have been illuminated by the qav ha-yosher. Hazzan,by contrast,seems to usegolem'm its more familiar sense of an artificial anthropoid. The verb gaval or gibbel (which, admittedly, occurs in another of Hazzan's quotations from Nathan)is significant in this connection : for it derives from a midrash that describes the creation of Adam as a golem (Lev. R. 2g:1) and recurs in medieval texts that speak of the making of an artificial man (Moshe Idel, Golem: Jewish Magical and Mysti cal cal Traditions On the Artificial Anthropoid [Albany, 1990], pp. 34~38).The Muslims construct this golem golem for the purpose of making a connection (le-hitqasher); unlike Nathan, Hazzan does not make clear with whom or what the connection is to be made. (It may be necessary to modify, on the basis of this passage, Idel's tentative judgment that "the anthropomorphic aspect of the Golem and the relation between the combination of letters and the emergence of the Supernal anthropos is not central in this [Sabbatian] version of Kabbalistic theosophy"; ibid., p. 154.The passage may also suggest a direction in which one might develop Yehuda Liebes's intriguing remarks on Islam as golem, in Sabbatian thought:"Golem be-gematria hokhmah," Kiryat Sefer 63[199°-91]1319•) (219) U-mi-zeh tedac sod nifla mah hayetah kavvanat ha-araviyyim she-hayu mishtahavim le-avaq ra glehemglehem ve-avraham avinu hay ah mekhavven lirhos otam ha-raglayim le-hasir oto ha-avaq kedei she-yukhelu le-hisshacenle-hisshacen tahat ha-ces ces ha-hayyim toratenu ha-qedoshah.The belief that underlies all this, that the Arabs prostrate themselves to the dust of their feet, is taken from BT Bava Mesia 86b. Isaiah Horowitz, interpreting this seemingly "mad" practice (shiggacon — the word regularly used in connection with Islam), makes a suggestion that eerily foreshadows Nathan's theology of the apostasy. Water,like Abraham himself,represents thesefirah Hesed•, the mecat mayimoï Gen 18:4 is that aspect of the sefirah that seeks to destroy the qelippot. Hesed is properly mayim rabbim (Song 8:7); yet at times mecat mayim needs to be taken from it,"in order to clothe itself in the qelippah and [thus] to subdue [it]" (aval pecamim be-hekhreah yuqqah na mecat mayim le-hitlabbesh ba-qelippah u-le-hakhniac.u-le-hakhniac. .

HALPERI N [68] lims are still the objects of benevolent concern. So they are again on fol 1141-, where we are told that Sabbatai Zevi "entered their religion in order to re store them and mend them and bring them into holiness under the She chinah's wings!'220 But,by fol 126v,Hazzan's tone has changed. Islam is back to its pre-Aqedah status as organized lunacy, rooted in" that madman" Muhammad, whose ad herents"bring into themselves an evil spirit when they go mad." Fol 12gr :"Be cause I did your will, and entered into this testing ... let not the fools think that you are favorably disposed toward [Islam]. For thou art not a God who de sires sires wickedness, the bad shall not dwell with thee', and this entire nation of luna tics [and] boasters shall not stand before thine eyes [Ps 5:5-6]." In a passage near the very end of the commentary — which is bound to seem, in the context of our discussion, sadly ironic — Hazzan represents Sabbatai as praying with the words of Ps 86:16: "Rescue the son of thy maid-servant', for I am now called, God forbid, as though [I were] son of the maid-servant221 Ishmael" (fol 133V). Did he manage to find a substitute Messiah? His final reference to Na than of Gaza,on fol 128v, suggests that he did. Citing a bit of exegesis by Na than, he attaches to his name the Messianic formulayr-hf may his majesty be (2 20) Hazzan's remarks on the preceding page (fol 113V) are extremely strange, and suggest that he is hinting at something he does not want to talk about. If the kingdom of Ishmael is a clay vessel, as Hazzan has already said on the authority of Nathan of Gaza (fol 11 tr), then Sabbatai's entering into it is comparable to the ritual of the sotah, which involves putting holy water into an earthenware earthenware vessel (Num 5:17). This, says Hazzan, is" the cruelest testing that the Light and Holy One of Israel entered into. . . .The Supernal King decreed this testing of the sotah, of the bit ter waters; to bring the mystery of King Messiah, who is the husband of Torah . . . into the daughter of Ishmael [!] who [masc.] is an earthenware vessel." Hazzan then cites"Zohar, Maso, page 125,"as applying Num 5:17 to"the mystery of the qelippotand concludes, mysteriously: "This is the King's decree, and one cannot criticize his ways, and let this be enoughr In at least two other passages (fols 31r and îogr-v, cf. 48V) Hazzan alludes darkly to the Zohar's interpre tation (III, 124b-125a) of the sotah ritual.The context of the Zoharic passage, and Hazzan's refer ence to the Messiah as"the husband of Torah,"suggest that the reading bevatyishmac'el (for the more usual bedat yishmxf'el) is correct, and that Hazzan is hinting at a particularly scandalous aspect of Sabbatai's apostasy: his having made love with one or more Muslim women. (Cf. above, n. 17.1 must acknowledge that Hazzan sometimes writes dalet so that it looks very much like bet\ e.g., datam on fol 126r, line 3.) Joseph ha-Levi presumably also refers to this when he dates the letter in which he reports Sabbatai's apostasy to"the year 5427, week of the Torah portion Esau went went to Ishmael, and took Mahalath to wife [Gen 28:9]"; that is, November 21-27,1666 (Sasportas, SisatSisat novel Sevi, p. 174).Gen 28:9 describes Mahalath as bat yishmac'el — the phrase occurs else where only in Gen 36:3 — and it seems possible that Hazzan, like ha-Levi, alludes to this pas sage. Cf. the remarks of Rivkah Shatz-Uffenheimer,"Portrait of a Sabbatian Sect" [Hebrew], Se funotfunotfunot 3-4(1960)410. (221) From Gen 16:10(ben ha-amah) ;but,in place of fen, Hazzan writes a final nun followed by a slash, which is presumably to be read ibn. He surely thinks it a mark of additional degradation that Sabbatai is not merely called "son of the maid-servant," but is called thus in Arabic.</page><page sequence="69">[69] THE SON OF THE MESSIAH 211 exalted." (We have already seen that Hazzan used this formula for Ishmael, the very first time he mentioned him.) Scholem assures us that this is"doubt less a slip of the pen for nr-w."222 But I think we need to take it with full seri ousness. Hazzan needed a present Messiah, here on earth. If it could not be Sabbatai Zevi, if it could not be the now-discarded Ishmael — then perhaps Nathan might suit? But Nathan also was mortal. He died in January 1680; as Hazzan perhaps learned shortly after he had promoted him to Messiahship, for he never mentions him again. This conjecture, that Hazzan's hopes had begun to explode nearly as soon as he constructed them,will explain the extraordinary melancholy of his final section. This is his exposition of Psalm 90,which seems to have been written when he was literally as well as figuratively running out of ink. He begins boldly enough : "A prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou art a refuge refuge . . ."(Ps 90:1 ).But then he stops; and resumes again, in the last "fresh start" of the manuscript (fol 134r).He begins, as usual, writing more neatly than he did before the hiatus. But the ink is fainter than before, and pro gressively grows so faint that by the end of the manuscript it is all but impossi ble to read. This last section of the commentary is the only one that is not dominated by the figure of Sabbatai Zevi. He is, in fact, mentioned explicidy only at the beginning, where Hazzan manages to find a numerical equivalence of tashev (verse 3) with"Sabbatai."223He explains that the Messiah Sabbatai is to be"re turned"at"the crushing of the soul (4'־at the end of all souls . . . when all hu mans return to their dust and the earth returns to be renewed." The earth then shall be made new and comforting. In it,we shall ourselves be renewed. Each day there will be a thousand years ; all will be day; night will turn into dawn. Sinless saints will enjoy this; also those whose souls have been perfecdy mended and built anew. Their death will be a sleep,from which they will awaken with renewed strength (fol 134V). At the end of each millenium will come their "evening," from which they will be renewed again and again like the phoenix. But they will not die, for God has swallowed up death for ever (fol 135r). (It is here that we have what may be one last reference to Sabbatai Zevi. "These are the ones who believed in the Primordial Unique One [yahid ha qadmon],whose faith in him was like a powerful love, who gave up their lives (222) "Perush mizmorei tehillim,"p.174; Liebes,p. 108. (223) The three letters of tashev, when spelled out, have nine letters among them. Add this to the numerical value of tashev itself, then add 1 for the word itself, and you get the value of "Sab batai"(g+702 +1 = 712). (224) Following the midrash of dakha 'm PT Hagigah 2:1,Ruth R.6:^,Eccl.R. 7:16.</page><page sequence="70">212 DAVID J. HALPERI N [70] for him'.' God will reward them accordingly, turning the torments they suf fered into pleasures in the next world. It is possible that, by the "Primordial Unique One? Hazzan intends Sabbatai.Yet no one died in torment for Sab batai; and it is at least as likely that Hazzan is speaking of God, and perhaps has in mind the martyrs of 1648.) Hazzan continues to develop these ideas over the next page and a half, as his writing declines into illegible faintness. His essential theme is that our pre sent life is brief and toilsome, our present world an abode of sadness and pain. "All our hope must be for those future days, when the Lord will make wings for us"and we will fly (fol 135V). In this world, we who are God's beloved friends are the targets of his rage. In the next, we will have our reward: when we see God(?) face to face, when the earth is filled with the knowledge of the Lord, when the Lord is king over all the earth. Writing with a melancholy lyricism that is profoundly affecting, Hazzan uses his last psalm commentary to develop a wistful fantasy of a future world in which all dreams come true and all pains are healed.The vindictiveness that has marked Hazzan's Messianic expectations, throughout his commentary, fades entirely away into the rosy glow of this final dream. The Messiah himself fades fades away. After the first ten lines, with the exception of one doubtful pas sage (above),he is not mentioned at all. And the hope of a Messianic king dom on this earth,which has animated the commentary until now, has been allowed to vanish. Was this the swan song of Hazzan's Sabbatian faith? Perhaps. It certainly was not the swan song of Hazzan himself.223Benayahu and Tamar have shown that he lived for at least forty years more (at least until 17 20) ; and that, at least from 1692 onward, he played a respectable and indeed prominent role in the life of the Jewish community of Kastoria (above, sec. 3). We need not infer from this last datum that Hazzan had given up his allé giance to Sabbatai Zevi. A person's holding Sabbatian beliefs, at the end of the seventeenth century,did not in the least exclude that person's having con siderable respect and influence among supposedly "normative"Jews; the ex amples of Samuel Primo and Judah Hasid sufficiently demonstrate this. Yet there is some tension between the commentary's recurrent complaints of rid icule and harassment at the hands of the "opponents," and the respectability its author seems to have enjoyed a dozen or so years later. Something seems to have changed for Hazzan between 1680 and 1692. Perhaps he abandoned (2 25) 1 continue to assume,as I have throughout this article, that Scholem was right in identi lying Israel Hazzan as the commentary's author. If we should ever discover that he was wrong, this paragraph and the next will turn out to be baseless. Everything else I have written about the author will be unaffected, other than that we must stop calling him "Hazzan."</page><page sequence="71">[71] THE SON OF THE MESSIAH 213 his Sabbatian commitments; perhaps he modified them; perhaps he only learned to be discreet about them. In some such way Hazzan may have risen, like the phoenix of his eschato logical fantasy, from the disillusionment and despair evident in his commen tary's closing pages. 11. 11. Concluding Reflections The beloved son is marked for both exaltation and for humiliation. In his life the two are seldom far apart. _ T 92« —— Jon D. Levenson In his life the two are seldom far apart. _ _ 99fi Ion 11 1 &lt;70 זגn crxn^■־ The story of Ishmael Zevi,as I have reconstructed it in the preceding sections, is overwhelmingly tragic. Its tragedy does not lie in his having died, or even in his having died young. We all must die ; and,in the world of the seventeenth century, the death of a young child was an event hardly to be remarked. But we hope that while we live others will at least in some measure recognize our presence ; we hope that they will at least for a little while preserve our mem ory after we die. Ishmael Zevi was deprived of both. He was, to be sure, a celebrity. From his birth, and perhaps even before his concepconcep tionf27 he had been anointed savior of his elders. He would redeem the humiliation and betrayal of his father's apostasy. He would integrate and re solve the contradictory identities,Jewish and Muslim, of his father and his fa ther's believers. He would heal the dreadful incongruity that Jews everywhere could see all around them : that God had given his promise to Isaac, yet had given to Ishmael (and to Esau) the fulfillment of every promise worth having. All these wondrous and impossible acts of resolution and integration would be done by and through the small person of Ishmael Mordecai Zevi. Who that person might happen to be in reality was a matter of no importance. If we are to grasp the full impossibility of the task laid upon this child, we must recognize a curious and paradoxical fact.The Muslim identity of Sabba tai Zevi, and of those Jews who followed him into apostasy, was (as far as we can tell) almost entirely devoid of Islamic content. The contrast between Chris tianity and Islam is in this respect very striking. Christianity actually left a sub stantial imprint on Sabbatian doctrine, in such tenets as the necessity of faith in a suffering and rejected Messiah. Islam, considered as a religious system, had no comparable impact on Sabbatian thought;228 indeed, seems to have (226) The Death and Resurrection of the Beloved Son, p. 59. (227) Nathan's letter of early 1667; above, n. 16. (228) We may point to a few possible traces of Shi'ite influence on Sabbatianism.The Sab batians'insistence on speaking of his death as a"disappearance" is reminiscent of the "occulta tion"of the Shi'ite imam, and the religious duplicity practiced by Sabbatian converts to Islam</page><page sequence="72">214 DAVID J. HALPERIN [72] held for the Sabbatians only the smallest and most incidental interest. Yet it was Islam that was the significant"Other"to Judaism, as far as the Sabbatians were concerned. Israel Hazzan, as we have seen, writes movingly of the Messianic task of bringing the "path of Truth" and the "path of Grace" into consonance. But what does he actually know of the Muslim path? He knows that they have a "Qur an','which Sabbatai Zevi is capable of chanting (fol 107r).He knows that they wash their hands and feet before prayer, and proposes a highly eccen trie explanation for this practice (fol uov-111v; see the preceding section). He knows that they spread their hands when they pray (fol 126r). He knows "the well-known fast" (obviously Ramadan), and the Sufi practices of wearing wool and repeating God's name a fixed number of times during prayer (fol 74v-75r).He knows, above all, the ever-fascinating symbolic turban. That is all he seems to know; all, apparently, that he cares to know. This indifference cannot mean that the Islamic path was unimportant to Hazzan and to like-minded individuals. It was plainly very important indeed. But its significance lay, not in what it actually was, but in the fact of its being the path that was not theirs. It was most especially significant in that it was a path that dominated much of the world, whereas their own Jewish way was everywhere subservient. It will follow that Ishmael Zevi was not expected to champion some rap prochement between Judaism and Islam — the faith, that is, that Muslims ac tually believed and practiced — nor yet to invent a new religious system that might incorporate both. Such an expectation he might conceivably have sat isfied. His task was to make it possible for a Jew such as Hazzan simultané ously to be himself and the"Other"; himself and someone who was not him self.229Obviously, no human being could accomplish such a task. Ishmael Zevi must therefore cease to exist as a human being (not to mention, as a ten-year old boy!) and become a mythic figure, acting out an archetypal drama that Hazzan found scripted in the Bible. In this sense,Ishmael Zevi does indeed perish in the Sabbatian Aqedah.By this, I do not mean that the fantasies that Hazzan (and others, presumably) suggests the radical Shi'ite doctrine of takiye (Scholem,Sabbatai Sm',p.314;"The Crypto-Jewish Sect of the Dônmeh [Sabbatians] in Turkey," in The Messianic Idea in Judaism And Other Essays on Jewish Spirituality Jewish Spirituality [New York, 1971], pp. 150-51,154). Both of these features may, as Scholem is in clined to believe, represent independent developments within Sabbatianism. (229) I have elsewhere made the case that the essential appeal of Sabbatai Zevi's Messianic claims lay in his ability to offer an emotionally satisfying mythic resolution to the insoluble his torical dilemma that confronted seventeenth-centuryjews, of how they might be themselves and at at the same time something other than themselves :"Sabbatai Zevi,Metatron,and Mehmed: Myth and History in Seventeenth-Century Judaism','in S.Daniel Breslauer (ed.), The Seductiveness of Jewish Myth: Challenge or Response y (Albany, 1997) pp. 271-308.</page><page sequence="73">[73] THE SON OF THE MESSIAH 215 projected upon the child actually caused his death. We have no reason to be lieve this was so, although it is easy enough to imagine ways his life might have been shortened by the fantastic expectations heaped upon him. But the refusal to recognize the reality of one's human existence, and still more so the obliteration of the memory that one ever existed, is in its own way an act of killing. While Hazzan believed that Ishmael Zevi was still alive, he turned him into an impossible synthesis of Isaac and Ishmael. In order to achieve the impos sible merger of the paths of "Truth"and of "Grace," he bound this wonder child to his imagination's altar. When he learned the child was dead, he made a whole-offering of his memory, and let the mythical figures of Isaac and Ish mael join in imaginary partnership in the empty space where the child had been. He later returned to Messianic-fantasy-as-usual, seemingly forgetting there ever had been an Ishmael Zevi. ".". . . the ancient, protean, and strangely resilient story of the death and res urrection of the beloved son'.' So Jon Levenson calls it, in the very last sen tence of his study of the Aqedah?30A theme so protean and so resilient must reflect some enduring feature, normally latent and unconscious, of the cul ture that creates and transmits it. Any manifestation of the theme is likely to shed light on some aspect of the theme's essential meaning. Levenson,working from the manifestations that surface in the Hebrew Bi ble itself, stresses that the beloved son is marked both by "his exalted status and the precariousness of his very life . . . marked for both exaltation and humiliation'.'231 He may be betrayed to death by the parent who professes to love him232and who at bottom prefers the blessing of faceless"progeny"over the real child he is in the process of sacrificing.233 His sufferings may turn out to be very much like those of the un-beloved child. Levenson argues persua sively that the Hebrew Bible gives Ishmael an Aqedah of his own, whose fea tures run parallel to those of Isaac's Aqedah:34The children of the beloved Isaac, too, re-enact the sufferings of Hagar and Ishmael."The exaltation of the (230) Death and Resurrection, p. 232.

(233) Ibid., p. 161.1 am not sure that Levenson would be prepared to state the implication of his observations as bluntly as I do. Cf. pp. 201-02:"The application to Jesus of the two not dis similar Jewish traditions of Isaac and the suffering servant sounds an ominous note, easily missed by those who interpret God's love in sentimental fashion: like Isaac, the paschal lamb,and the suffering servant, Jesus will provide his father in heaven complete pleasure only when he has endured a brutal confrontation with nothing short of death itself!' I do not think one has to be a sentimentalist to regard this as a perverse and dreadful mode of parental "love." (234) 7&amp;!&lt;f.,pp.82-110,124,132.</page><page sequence="74">216 DAVID J. HALPERIN [74] chosen brother. . . has its costs: it entails the chosen's experience of the bit ter reality of the unchosen's life. Such is the humiliation that attends the ex altation of the beloved son'.'235 If an "Aqedah of Ishmaef'is latent in the Bible, as Levenson supposes, it is made manifest in the pages of Israel Hazzan. In Hazzan's hopes and disillu sionments, as recorded in his commentary, something of the dark uncon scious of the ancient Aqedah complex acts itself out. Its victim, seemingly ex alted, is worse than humiliated : he is abandoned and consumed. His voice is ignored,his reality unseen, his existence forgotten. No parent or angel or de ity intervenes to save him. The cruelty and delusional folly that are the Aqe dah's worst and most archaic elements are re-enacted, late in the seventeen th century, upon the forlorn person of the Messiah's child. Adored for what he was not, unknown for what he was, Ishmael Zevi was made into a vessel for elaborate illusions that he may never have begun to understand. The illusions endured, as illusions will. The vessel shattered, and was abandoned to silence. Excursus: Ishmael Zevi and Isaac Zevi In his collection of studies, The Shabbatean Movement in Greece (pp. 163-78), Meir Benayahu proposed an ingenious and original solution to the mystery of Ishmael Zevi's disappearance. Emden and the Dônme were wrong : he did not die in childhood, nor was he a Muslim at the time of his death. Rather, he returned from Adrianople to Salonika after 1677 to pursue hisjewish ed ucation, and there returned to Judaism at some time in the 1680s. Upon his reconversion, he changed his name from Ishmael to Isaac. He is to be identi fied with Isaac Zevi, who served as rabbi of Sarajevo from about 1690 at least until 1716. What we know about Ishmael Zevi before 1690, and what we know about Isaac Zevi after that year, fits together well enough. Their ages seem at least roughly to correspond. So do their names. Even if the Sabbatians had not identified Ishmael Zevi with the Biblical Isaac (as Hazzan, at least, did), one could hardly imagine anything more suitable than the Muslim Ishmael's taking the name Isaac upon his return to Judaism. What we know about Isaac Zevi, moreover, suggests a close link with Salonika and its scholars, and it seems an inescapable conclusion that he studied there. The document that Cuenque claims to have seen in Ostrog in 1688 or 1689 presumably de rived from Salonika, and Cuenque's enthusiastic description of it — which (235) !M., p. 96.</page><page sequence="75">[75] THE SON OF THE MESSIAH 217 Benayahu endorses as reliable beyond the smallest suspicion of doubt (p. 166) — suggests that Ishmael Zevi had become by age twenty a Jewish scholar of 9 g A some stature. As for the Dônme tradition that Ishmael died as a child, this can be ex plained easily enough on Benayahu's hypothesis. By returning to Judaism, their youthful Messiah turned his back on his father's example, and so be trayed the expectations of his most devoted followers. He"died" to them, and they got their revenge by declaring him literally to have died. (One is tempted to imagine them"sitting shiva"for him.) The vindictive anti-Sabbatians, Em den among them, were only too happy to believe them. The circumstantial evidence, combined with Benayahu's having provided a neat solution to what otherwise might seem an intractable problem, con stitute the strengths of his hypothesis. But it has very substantial weaknesses as well. To begin with, Benayahu offers practically no evidence that is not circum stantial. He points out that Isaac Zevi's son, Shem Tov Zevi (who died some time before 1748),"invariably includes his father's name in his signature, while his father invariably signs with his name only. Surely this is indicative!" (p. 178). It is indeed interesting. But it is the only datum about Isaac Zevi, in voked by Benayahu, that even begins to make better sense if we assume he was Sabbatai Zevi's son than if we assume he was not. This assumption, moreover, creates very formidable problems of its own. It would not seem, on Benayahu's hypothesis, that Isaac Zevi was particularly concerned to hide his original identity. If he were, surely he would have changed his name more drastically, to efface all trace of his link with the most infamousjewish figure of his time.But,without some serious effort on his part to conceal his origins, how could they have failed to become widely known? It cannot possibly have been a matter of indifference to his Jewish contempo raries that the son of the false Messiah,who had spent at least the first ten years of his life as a Muslim, was now functioning as a leader and teacher in Israel. Even if the now-Jewish Ishmael/Isaac had tried to hide his background, it is not clear he could have succeeded.The Dônme could easily have revenged themselves on their "apostate" Messiah, making his life miserable by trailing him and denouncing him to Jewish communities wherever he went — much as some Sabbatian radicals, posing as orthodox heresy-hunters, took advan (236) We must remember, however, that Benayahu could produce no direct evidence for his assumption that Ishmael returned to Salonika after 1677. Nor does he observe that, if he is right, then Cuenque must be wrong about Ishmael having grown up in the sultan's court after Sabbatai's death. If Cuenque is unreliable on this point, why should we trust (as Benayahu does) his account of the Ostrog document?</page><page sequence="76">218 DAVID J. HALPERIN [76] tage of their status within their communities to persecute such"moderates" as Cardozo.237 But it seems that Isaac Zevi did not even try to conceal who he was. The Jewish world cannot possibly have remained unaware that the son of the great deceiver was now Sarajevo's rabbi. Can we imagine that his parent age, Muslim upbringing, and former Messianic status never became issues of controversy in his rabbinic career? For Isaac Zevi, as Benayahu depicts him, was no stranger to controversy or criticism. His contract as marbis torah in Sarajevo came up for renewal every three years; and, some time early in 1714, the community leaders refused to renew it. On 17 Iyyar 5474(2 May 1714) his former teacher, Solomon Amarillo of Salonika,wrote on his behalf. The rank and file of SarejevanJewry, Amarillo claimed, had wanted to reappoint Isaac Zevi. But the moneyed elite," without any grounds whatsoever beyond malice and hatred," had tried to dismiss an upright rabbi "in whom there was not the smallest blemish!'This was, more over, not the first time Amarillo had had to intervene in the quarrel.238 What was the quarrel about? Beyond the class tensions involved (if we are to trust Amarillo), we have no clue. The date, however, is important. The controversy surrounding Nehemiah Hiya Hayon had erupted the preceding summer. By 1714,crypto-Sabbatianism had become a hot issue injewish com munities throughout Europe.239 This might at first sight seem to support Be nayahu's hypothesis. Perhaps the opposition to Isaac Zevi was really directed against his notorious father, and the supposedly groundless "malice and ha tred"denounced by Amarillo was in fact motivated by the suspicion that he had continued to nourish heretical beliefs behind an orthodox mask? Given the anxieties about covert heresy that prevailed in 1714, it is quite in conceivable that any attack on Sabbatai Zevi's son, whatever its original moti vation, should not have transformed itself into accusations that he was his father's true heir. Yet (at least as far as Benayahu was able to discover) we hear nothing nothing of this. Amarillo's letter suggests an effort to unseat a preacher who has made himself a bit too popular with the ordinary folk; nothing more. An argument from silence, indeed. But we can make it even sharper. Sara jevo wasvery much in the background of the Hayon controversy. Hayon'sfam ily came from Sarajevo ; his enemies claimed he had been born there ; he was married there in the 1670s. Of his two archenemies in the controversy, Moses Hagiz and Hakham Zevi Ashkenazi, the latter had been a predecessor of Isaac Zevi in the Sarajevo rabbinate. Hakham Zevi was forced to leave Sarajevo in t688,as the result of a quarrel with two men closely linked to Hayon (one of (237) Elisheva Carlebach ,The Pursuit of Heresy : Rabbi Moses Hagiz and the Sabbatian Controver siessiessies (New York, 1990), p. 77. (238) Shabbatean Movement in Greece, pp. 176-77. (239) Carlebach, pp. 75-159.</page><page sequence="77">[771 THE SON OF THE MESSIAH 21g whom, he later believed, was Hayon himself).240 If Benayahu's hypothesis is correct, therefore, Hakham Zevi will have been forced out of Sarajevo — by Hayon, as he thought — to be replaced a short time afterward by Sabbatai Zevi'sZevi's very own son.Did it never occur to him to make this point, in the course of his vendetta against Hayon? Can Isaac Zevi and his opponents in Sarajevo have failed to become caught up in the Hayon controversy — if Isaac Zevi had had anything in common with Sabbatai Zevi other than the name? And, if they had, is it conceivable that no hint of this should survive in our sources? And is it conceivable that Hakham Zevi's son, Jacob Emden, should have been so oblivious to Isaac Zevi's background that he could insist that Sabbatai Zevi's"offspring turned outjust like him ; the impure birth [ Ishmael Zevi] died an Ishmaelite, and Sabbatai Zevi and his worthless lineage were cut off with out any survivor" (above, sec. 9)? Emden emphasizes this last point with a whole string of Biblical texts such asjob 18:19, No offspring or progeny among his people,people, no remnant in his dwelling places. Yet Isaac Zevi survived at least until 1716; his son and successor, ShemTov Zevi, at least until 1732. I will concede that Emden was writing in 1752, and that (according to Be nayahu) Shem Tov Zevi died before 1748. It is thinkable that he had no chil dren or nephews; or, if he did, that they and any children they may have had were all dead by 1752. Even on Benayahu's hypothesis, therefore, Emden's claim that Sabbatai Zevi's lineage was exterminated may technically have been correct?41 Yet what a very distorted picture it gives ! And, in view of Hak ham Zevi's ties with Sarajevo, it is very difficult to imagine that his son might have known no better. Our conclusion must be that Benayahu's hypothesis, alluring as it is, stag gers under the weight of its implausibilities. Ishmael Zevi and Isaac Zevi were two more or less contemporary individuals with little in common beside their name.Ishmael's mysterious disappearance from the historical record must be solved in some other way. In this article, I have presented what I believe to be an appropriate solution.* (24°) Ibid,., pp. 86,106-07.
