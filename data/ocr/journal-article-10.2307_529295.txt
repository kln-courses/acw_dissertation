<plain_text><page sequence="1">Achilleion: A Neolithic Mound in Thessaly; Preliminary Report on 1973 and 1974 Excavations Marija Gimbutas IJniversity of California, Los Angeles This is a preliminary report on the tJCLA excavations of 1973 and 1974 at Achillefon, Greeve, that were conducted in cooperation with Creek authorities. A chillefon lies in the heart of Thessaly and is a stratiJied neolithic mound which yielded a cultural sequence supported by radiocarbon dates and stratigraphy from ca. 6500 to 5500 B.C. The excavatioz1s have revealed vital information on the environment, economy, architecture, ceramies industry, and religion of the Sesklo civilization. Introduction. Achilleion is a tell of 200 m. x 260 m. composed solely of neolithic debris. It lies on the southeastern edge of the Karditsa Plain and is one of several hun- dred neolithic mounds in this area as yet hardly touched by archaeologists (FIG.I). The UCLA excavations took place in August and early September of 1973 and 1974 supported by the National Science Foundation, Samuel H. Kress Foundation, and American INVS-Co. The effort was in cooperation with Dr. D. Theocharis, general inspector of Thessaly, in 1973 and K. Gallis, director of the Larissa Archaeological Museums in 1974. Approximately 40 American, Greek, British, Dutch and Hungarian scholars and students participated.' Stratigraphy and Chronology. Four squares in the center of the mound (A - D), several on the south slope (E, F) and four test pits in the peripheries were opened (see site plan, F[G.2). Completion of our investigation was prevented by the political unrest brought about by the Cyprus conflict. Before our work was halted, sterile ground was reached in Squares A and B at an approximate depth of 4.20 m. A clear and complete stratigraphy is therefore present in the strategic North Baulks of these two squares. This stratigraphy, together with the C-14 dates and typological studies of settlement phases, provides a substantial body of in- formation concerning the Early and Middle Neolithic of Greece (TABLES l, 2, FIG. 3). Occupation of the site began in the middle of the seventh millennium B.C. and continued for approximately 900 to 1,000 years. This occupation parallels the Catal Huyuk VI-II and Hacilar Pottery Neolithic and Chalcolithic se- 1.

It is apparent then that in southeastern Europe an autonomous, full-fledged neolithic culture developed synchronically with that of the Near East. The chronology has been divided into four principal phases, each with two or three subdivisions (TABLE 3). This classification is based on changes in architectural practice and ceramic style, although the change is very gradual; there are no distinct breaks or sudden innovations. Phase I, with three sub- phases, belongs to the Early Neolithic; Phases II-IV, comprising seven sub- phases, belong to the Middle Neolithic. These phases document the Sesklo civilization in a complete sequence such as is not present even at the name site. Succeeding phase or phases of the same culture have been traced by us by sur- face collection on the western part of the mound and on a neighboring mound, Narthakion, 5 km. south of Achilleion. 2.

Nomenclature. The Achilleion sequence calls for revision of the traditional nomenclature employed for the Thessalian Neolithic. Our term 'Early Neolithic' at Achilleion includes what is conventionally termed "Pre-pottery," "Early Pottery," and "Proto-Sesklo." Our term 'Middle Neolithic' includes the "Pre- Sesklo" and"Sesklo." One of the primary objectives of our investigation at Achilleion was to find the posited aceramic or "Pre-Pottery" period of the Neolithic of southeastern Europe.3 We have negatively succeeded; it does not exist at this site. At Achilleion, as at Sesklo near Volos and at Argissa and Soufli near Larissa (sites with excavated levels presumed to be aceramic), stone objects demonstrating skilled craftsmanship are associated with early pottery (FIG. 4).4 Since the contemporaneity of the earliest layers at these sites, including Achilleion, can be established by the correlation of C-14 dates (ca. 7500-7200 Figure 4.

List of radiocarbon dates. B.P.) with stratigraphic evidence, the absence of pre-pottery levels at Achilleion necessitates a re-examination of the evidence for "pre-pottery" levels at those sites. The "Early Pottery" of Achilleion and of Argissa, Sesklo, and Soufli is not primitive: burnishing and the use of a white kaolin slip were already employed (well evidenced at Achilleion in Phase Ia); beautifully rounded bowls and dishes standing on ring bases and pierced lug handles were achieved. Such pottery stands at the beginning of the series known to archaeological literature as "Proto-Sesklo" (Achilleion Ib and c). But there are only very gradual and insigniF1cant changes between Early Pottery and Proto-Sesklo. We unite these categories under the term Early Neolithic. The continuous unity of development demonstrated at Achilleion renders the "Pre-Sesklo" term illogical. If it is deemed necessary to distinguish the Thessalian Neolithic as "Sesklo," the correlations should be as follows: Early Neolithic for Proto-Sesklo (three phases); Middle Neolithic for Sesklo (with four phases).

Chronological classification of Achilleion phases. animals, permanent settlements, potterys stone and bone industries, and well- developed religious beliefs seems to occur typically within certain en- vironmental conditions. Early Neolithic sites are often found on hillsides in an area conducive to farming or herdings and near a perennial source of water. This latter factor is frequently associated with the presence of clay and kaolin deposits in the vicinity. Sources for the lithic industry, such as greenstones red jasper, and other kinds of stone deposits, are also present.5 It seems logical to suppose that transitional aspects between pre-sedentary and sedentary economies will not be found in such localities. When FIrst settled, Achilleion exhibited maximum suitability for the Neolithic economy. The climate was wetter and cooler than at presents and the environs boasted a mixed forest which sheltered wild fauna - roe deer, red deer, fallow deer, aurochs, wild swine, red fox, hare, wild cat, badger, wild birds, and several species now extinct in the region such as ibex-and pro- vided an amplitude of other dietary resources suitable for exploitation by 5.

Architectural remains of Phase s lope A B c D , 1m Phase la (FIG. 15). The earliest pots are blunt-lipped vessels, with simple shapes, either hemispherical or globular. Round bases, ring bases, small pierced lug handles, and small knobs are also present. A small amount of the pottery is crudely made and resembles the "Early Pottery" of other sites. These vessels have fairly thick walls, and the fabric contains considerable temper. Surfaces are roughly smoothed and burnished; slips do not bond well to the porous fabrics. At this earliest phase, pottery is made either entirely of white kaolin or of an orange earthen fabric. These two varieties begin immediately above sterile ground and continue throughout the entire occupation of the mound. Phase Ib (FIGS. 16, 17). Simple shapes remain frequent, but large vessels with outflaring ledge rims are notable. Closed forms with upturned rims are characteristic of this and following phases. Ring bases have more outflaring shapes. Painted designs on pottery appear first in this phase, a fugitive kaolin paint colored with red iron</page><page sequence="16">292 A chillefon: A Neolithic Mound in Thessaly/Gimbutas oxide was applied on a white slip over heavily tempered fabric. The triangle is the only pattern that has thus far been encountered. Phase II (FIGS. 18, 19). Most of the forms of the previous phase continue; in addition, there are high-necked vessels and a significant percentage of folded rims. Round and flattened elliptical handles are introduced. Small and large round, flat knobs, and clusters of applique bumps start at this time and continue in later phases. The manufacture of pottery showed considerable improvement in this phase. Slips bond well; burnishing is fine; and painted wares are more numerous and of better quality. New color appears in this phase with the introduction of white paint, while a variation in firing technique produces a brown tone in the red paint. New motifs include parallel lines and chevrons in white paint and net patterns in red. The cruder pottery is sometimes fingernail impressed, sometimes incised. Phase III (FIGS. 20, 21, 22). The transition from Phase 1I to Phase 111 is gradual but obvious. Phase III represents the florescence of ceramic art at Achilleion and can be seen in the tremendous assortment of wares, in the variety of decorative designs, and in other innovations. Strap handles and high ring bases are employed. Thin applique is common. Wares are produced in red, brown or black fabrics. Some untempered, and very thin-walled vessels are well fired.

Banded flames, lozenges with flames, and step or stylized ram-horn designs predominate and continue throughout the whole Sesklo sequence. The beak or V motif, rows of equilateral triangles near the rim, zigzags, broad wash, and the checkerboard motif appear in association with the SSflame" and SSstep" motifs. In Phase IIIb twisted handles and spouts are new elements. Phase I F. The ceramics of the final levels at Achilleion continue the traditions of Phase III, but show less care in manufacture. The open bowls, small straight- sided pots, and high-necked vessels resemble those of Phase III. At the end of this phase some small vessels are crudely made. The painted pottery is iden- tified by SSfree style": flames and steps are not rigid, but flow unevenly. Blobs, daubs, and appendages are introduced. Fingernail impressions reappear. At the end of the Achilleion sequence bichrome painting begins. Figure 24. Phase IVa. Anthropomorphic libation vessel with EIsh-like (spout) mouth, modeled ears and incised eyes.

The outstanding contribution of Achilleion to the study of the Neolithic is the exceptional yield of objects with religious implications. These objects in- clude anthropomorphic and masked vases (FIG. 23), libation vessels (FIG. 24), ladles (FIG. 25), offering dishes and miniature tables (FIG. 26), and lamps. Most important are the 227 figurines which obviously represent a pantheon of deities, sacred animals, and participants in religious ceremonies. Such fig- urines are common to southeast European neolithic cultures and are spo- radically represented at various sites, but at Achilleion, the pantheon is the earliest and most complete. The Great Goddess of Regeneration and Birth Giving (FIGS. 27, 28); the Pregnant Goddess of Fertility (FIGS. 29, 30); the cosmogonic Snake Goddess (FIG. 31) and Bird Goddess (FIG. 32); and the Enthroned Male God (FIG. 33) are all represented. Figurines are usually found within the dwellings or in the sacriElcial, circular hearth in the courtyard. Their customary place seems to have been on the main architectural feature of the home, a low dais near, or connected to, a domed oven. The form of the figurines indicates they were kept on a flat sur- face; they are either flat based, seated on a throne or stool, or recline leaning on the buttocks. Fine white-slipped and painted vases, miniature vessels, lamps and thrones, clay ladles, spools, and sometimes spindle whorls and greenstone axes are con- sistently found with figurines. This association occurs in practically every house uncovered. Concrete examples are given below. Phase 11 (FIG. 9: Square D). Figurines of the enthroned and masked Pregnant Goddess, a separate throne, an assortment of decorated pottery, and a fragment of an anthropomorphic vase with upraised arm were found clustered in the vicinity of a clay bench and reed matting. Phase Illa (FIG. 10: Square B). Nine figurines and cult vessel legs were found in the area of a raised stone pavement, (probably a dais next to a domed oven), and a piece of furniture (either a bench or a table). Another accumulation was recorded in Square D: the Pregnant Goddess with folded arms, several phallic heads with pinched noses, and many separate legs of seated or enthroned figurines were found in association with offering vessels, ladles, exquisite painted pottery, a spool, a spindle whorl, and a human mandible. Phase Illb. The largest cluster of cult equipment and figurines was within the pise house in Square C and the circular depression next to it: 19 figurines, four cult vessels, and fragments of masked vases were discovered here. Phase I Ma. Within the stone house (FIG. 13: Square A) were found effigies of the Snake Goddess, the Bird Goddess, the Pregnant Goddess and the enthroned Male God. In the stone house of Square C of the same phase, eight legs of seated figurines, two masked pillar heads, and a leg of a sacriElcial vessel were found in association with clay ladles and painted pottery.

Another cluster of figurines representing various types of deities and fragments of vases with anthropomorphic masked faces and upraised human arms was found within the stone house of Square A (FIG. 14). The Pregnant Goddess is the most frequently represented and occasionally several effigies of this deity occur within a given group. The Nurse, a female carrying a baby in a pouch on her back, is a companion figure in a cluster of Phase IIIb. The various combinations of deities presumably indicate in- dividual or familial preferences. Among the most remarkable and rare finds of the 1974 season are the figurines representing the Goddess in a birth-giving aspect. One, a clay figurine in the natural birth-giving position shows an exposed vulva (FIG. 27). Another is meticulously carved in gleaming black stone (FIG. 28).7 The 1973 season yielded a unique figurine from a Sesklo layer (Achilleion III): a cylindrical stand with a discrete removable mask (FIG. 34). The mask was modeled to slide onto the pillar shaped conically to prevent total descent of the mask. The piece has been published by the author.8 This is the only ex- ample of a removable mask although five other pillars with attached masks were found (FIG. 35). The early and middle neolithic strata of Thessaly and Macedonia have yielded a considerable number of seals or stamps bearing chevron, spiral, meandroid, stair, schematized horn, concentric circle, and labyrinthine designs. The same motifs appear painted on Sesklo pottery and apparently are ideograms, specific permanent configurations with religious connotations. One of the Achilleion seals is exceptional for its masterful. workmanship and design. It is a thin piece of alabaster engraved with channels forming a com- plicated meandroid design. At the end of each groove is a circular depression (FIG. 36). Perhaps this seal or stamp was used as a miniature game board as there is an opening at one end into which liquid could have been poured. Among the nearly 3,000 specimens classified as special finds were pendants of serpentinite and alabaster with neat perforations and peculiar rectangular solids of clay. The latter were either plain or bore a pitted decoration and may have been used as weights or in games. The use intended for clay discs made of broken pots which were recovered by the hundreds is puzzling. It is possible they were used as decoration on ritual hipbelts, crossbands, or as shoulder at- tachments, as is indicated by figurines bearing the same knob-like treatment. Figure 36.

This little amulet is the earliest example of the 'frogwoman' series in Old Europe (Achilleion Phase lb), and has parallels in Catal Huyuk and Hacilar in central Anatolia, and in a number of neolithic sites in the Balkans (Anza 11 in Macedonia; Azmak in central Bulgaria of Karanovo I phase; Franchthi Cave in the eastern Peloponnese). 8.
