<plain_text><page sequence="1">JESHO, Vol. XXXVII, ? E.J. Brill, Leiden FURTHER EVIDENCE FOR 'CENTRAL ASIAN' MATERIALS FROM THE ARABIAN GULF BY ELISABETH C. L. DURING CASPERS (Leiden) The coasts of Arabia bordering on the Arabian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea were natural stopping off places for traffic from the ancient Near East and South Asia; consequently, the region received cultural impulses from both quarters throughout the last three millennia B.C. down to historical times. It is, therefore, not surprising that the Murghabo-Bactrian culture, generated by surprisingly wealthy farming societies of high artistic and technical knowledge living in northwest Afghanistan, southern Uzbekistan (ancient Bactria) and the Murghabo river delta in southeastern Turkmenia (ancient Margiana) whose impact is evinced from ancient Mesopotamia in the west to the Indus Valley Civiliza- tion in the east') has also made its influence felt both culturally and/or in a mercantile sense, along the southern shores of the Arabian Gulf and in the Arabian Peninsula. Calibrated C-14 datings and cross references to comparable materials from datable cultural complexes in neighbouring areas gives this Central Asian culture a floreat in the later half of the third and the first centuries of the second millennium B.C. The recognition of a 'Central Asian' influence extending to the Gulf region (Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain Island, northeastern Saudi Arabia and the Island of Failaka) was brought about by the discovery of a great variety of Murghabo-Bactrian materials in the Kachi Plain of Central Baluchistan; at the South Cemetery of Mehrgarh, Period VIII, in 1) For references see e.g. The Bronze Age Civilization of Central Asza: Recent Soviet Discoverzes, Ph.L.

Pottier has published6) a preliminary investigation into com- parable 'Central Asian' materials in Iranian and Pakistani Baluchistan-at the tell of Khurab in the Bampur Valley and at Mehi, burials 11 and 111, and at Shahi Tump. Between 1961-1965 and 1986 artefacts of different categories were unear- thed at various localities in the Arabian Gulf. They remained uncommented upon because they were inconsistent with the main body of archaeological material found with them. Between 1961 and 1962 a rescue dig in the tumulus field of 'Ali, Central Bahrain, by the Danish Archaeological Expedition furnished three red- slipped, glossy pedestalled goblets showing a characteristic thickened plastic ridge at the junction of the cup and the splayed stem. Two of the goblets were decorated with cross-hatched, upturned triangles in black with single rows of horizontal dashes between them. The third was left undecorated7) (Fig. 1). In 1968 Mrs. E. P. Jefferson, an amateur archaeologist, opened a tumulus at Hamala North m north-west Bahrain and discovered amongst other gravegoods the upper part of a wheel-thrown goblet, with thin walls made of a brick-red coloured clay, which originally may have had a pedestalled splayed foot since identifiable fragments were present. A dark plum-red decoration on the outside of the upper part of the goblet consisted of five cross-hatched butterfly motives, at one point interspersed by what 2) M.

In the course of the excavations at Sdr el-Jisr in Central Bahrain by the Arab Expedition in 1977 and 1978/79 three more pedestalled goblets were discovered, two of them in one mound, the third found on its own9). One goblet is made of a grey-dark ware with glossy burnishing and was turned on a wheel. The remaining two are said to be of the red ware type of the three 'Ali pedestalled goblets mentioned above. The larger goblet shows a herring-bone pattern between two parallel lines executed in black below an indistinctly painted row of fishes. The smaller one has a fairly broad zone of criss-cross hatching or a net-like design in black positioned under the outer rim.

The one-storeyed tumulus at Hamala North in north-west Bahrain, previously referred to, has proved to be of exceptional importance. The archaeological material, presently on permanent exhibition in The British Museum, London, contained, besides the cup fragment already discussed, pottery and copper/bronze parallels with objects of the Barbar Culture of Bahrain, and with Mesopotamia, and banded agate beads which would seem to point to contacts with the Indus Civilization.

The painted cup section of the pottery goblet from the Hamala North tumulus is broken off just above the point where one would expect to find a distinctive joint, should there have been one. The goblet fragments from the City II levels at the Qala'at al-Bahrain do not afford a reliable reconstruction. Conversely, the painted pottery goblets from 'Ali and from Dhahran do have this distinct ridge. The absence of a ridge may, at first sight, seem to indicate a local initiative in production like the adding of a painted decoration to some of the Arabian Gulf goblets, which is definitely non-Bactrian. However, both the Murghab delta region and Bactria also show in their goblet potteries, various types which do not have the distinct ridge under their cup section27). Here we must refer to the well-known copy, misconceived by the maker, from the Barbar Temple IIA on Bahrain 28) of a type of copper/bronze mir- ror known from the Bactrian graves which have a handle representing a stylized, headless female figurine with hands on hips. The head is provided by the reflected face of the user of the mirror One such copper/bronze mir- ror with an anthropomorphic handle had come from Mehi deposit 11 (2.1.a.)29) and it is the only example of its kind so far found outside the Murghabo-Bactrian homeland (Fig 9). The Barbar mirror handle differs from these in that the figurine is male and very much in the ancient Sumerian tradition. It stands on a curved base, the foot of which has two rivet holes and a slot in which a round mirror head must once have been fixed. Although this mirror handle exhibits cultural traits of Mesopotamia, Dilmun or Barbar, and Kulli-Mehl, the fact that it has to be turned upside down in order to function as a mirror handle clearly shows the maker's misconception of the functional artistry of the copper/bronze mirrors from Mehi and Bactria (Fig. 10). In the light of the foregoing, it does not come as a surprise to find that in other categories of Central Asian-related materials from the Arabian Gulf imitations also occur. Additional support for a possible Central Asian con- tact for the copper/bronze horned animal from Bahrain comes from the 27) During Caspers 1992, p. 8, Fig. if. 28) P V Glob, "Temples at Barbar", Kuml 1954, pp. 149-153, Fig. 6; M.S.N.

Three pendants or repouss6 plaques made of gold or electrum representing two-headed and two-torsoed caprids, decorated with incisions are reported from the Wadi Suq long grave at Qatarrah30). Two of the pendants are reinforced at the legs by one or a pair of additional legs and fitted with hooks or loop-attachments at the back. A repousse plaque thought to be a lion(?) and a silver bull figurine were found with them. Two complete pendants and one fragmentary one portraying two goats standing back to back have come from Site 99 at Shimal and Site 2 at Dhayah (Ras al-Khaimah), U.A.E.31); and an electrum pendant in the shape of two- headed and two-torsoed goats or caprids with hooks at the concave back, the legs reinforced by an extra coating of silver, have been discovered in a long collective tomb at Bidya 1 (Fujairah), U.A.E.32). The use of animals (goats, Pamir sheep, bulls, dogs, birds etc.) as small three dimensional models, or as decorative heads of cosmetic sticks and spatulas is well attested in Murghabo-Bactrian metal art and in the glyptics. But the portrayal of protomes of animals, primarily caprids is relatively rare, although they are an inherent part of this Central Asian culture. A possible local production of the gold, electrum and silver pendants from the United Arab Emirates should be taken into consideration influenced as it must have been by Central Asian animal art. Could the copper/bronze goat figurine from Bahrain be treated likewise? 33) 30) S.

It would, therefore, be scien- tifically incorrect to ignore the occurrence of animal protomes-almost exclusively long-necked gazelle-or capnrid-like creatures-represented on the circular stamp seals found at Bahramin and Failaka.

The metal object illustrated by E. Haerminck min "The Rectangular Umm An-Nar-Penriod Grave at Mowaihat (Emirate of Ajman, United Arab Emirates", Gentse Bydragen tot de Kunstgeschiedents en Oudheidkunde XXIX (1990-1991), Gent, 1991, P1. VI B (middle) on p. 27 does not appear to fall into our chopping-knife' category To find this 'chopping-knife' type of implement min the Royal Cemetery at Ur does not come as a surprise considering that many of the pins and toilet articles illustrated on the same P1. 231 (Vol. 2) of Woolley's 1934 publication can be matched exactly against those from Central Asia. A meticulous search through all of the Royal Cemetery material would undoubtedly be very rewarding for providing a reliable inventory of the actual quantity of Murghabo-Bactrian imports at Ur min the latter half of the third and the early second millen- nium B.C. Surprisingly the recent publication by F Tallon, Mitallurgie Sustenne I (2 vols.), Notes et Documents des Mus6es de France 15, Paris, 1987, does not provide any clear com- parisons with the Central Asian 'choppming-kmnives', although contacts between the two regions are well attested.</page><page sequence="16">48 ELISABETH C.

The small chlorite flask with a circular neck and a dotted circle design on each of its four sides to which reference has already been made above is additional evidence. Although we are confronted with clear evidence of Bactrian contacts in the Oman Peninsula and Bahrain and to a lesser extent, so far, in Saudi Arabia and Failaka, we are still not in a position to point to any of these areas as having been instrumental in the production of these local imitations. Particularly interesting in the light of the foregoing is the discovery of a 30 1 cm. long c. 99% copper axe in a late Umm an-Nar context at Tell Abraq (Umm al-Quaiwain), U.A.E. during the first excavation season of 198946). D T. Potts compares it with a blade-axe from the settlement on Umm an-Nar, graves 1 and 3 min the cemetery of Maysar-4 and those known from the Indus Valley Civilization (Moenjo-daro, Harappa, Rojdi in Gujarat) and Susa where they are referred to as adzes. One fact which bears particularly on the Harappan comparison is the thin skin of metal on the Tell Abraq axe both above and below which were corrosion levels. One of the blade-axes from Moenjo-daro was also described as bearing "a thick, even skin, .. remarkably clean and extremely regular in thickness (0 03 min.)"' 47) and a similar skin is also visible in the photograph of the bar celt from Rojdi 48). Potts asserts that "this is a feature otherwise unknown in the Near East, and it may indicate an affinity with the Harappan tradition"49). The fact that in the cited references these copper implements are iden- tified as blade-axes, adzes or bar celts, may justify the introduction of another comparison from the Quetta deposit in Central Baluchistan, where a long flat axe was discovered, said to be typical of the Harappan metallurgy5o) and a long flat chisel of copper from Diraz level 2 on Bahrain published by P Lombard and M. Kervran51) which the authors compare with the copper assemblages of the Harappan Civilization, and which they 46) D T Potts, A Prehistoric Mound in the Emirate of Umm al-Qaiwain-Excavations at Tell Abraq in 1989, Munksgaard, 1990, pp. 37-41, Figs. 34-36. 47) E.

L. DURING CASPERS confirm were common in the Oman Peninsula during the late third millen- nium B.C., disappearing in the early second millennium B.C. As we have pointed out elsewhere52) an intricate weave of mercantile interaction connected the Arabian Gulf and South Asia, and an equally intricate intercultural exchange connected the various Gulf cultures them- selves. Only further research and more fieldwork can decide whether mer- cantile/economic forces or other factors are responsible for the presence of Bactrian and Bactrian-influenced materials in the Arabian Gulf. Never- theless, we venture to put forward a few suggestions, validity of which must await proof. Kohl and Pottier53) are of the opinion that the present archaeological evidence from southeastern Iran and Pakistani Baluchistan does not support the theory of a large-scale movement of Central Asian peoples into these areas, contrary to what may well have been the case in the Kachi Plain of Central Baluchistan. These two authors favour, rather, a theory of annual economically-motivated migratory cycles between the coastal regions of Baluchistan, Central Baluchistan, and the edge of the Dasht-i Lut where now new people with Central Asian affinities were living. The continuity of local pottery traditions in the Bampur Valley sites and in southern Pakistan lends weight to the theory. Could we then interpret the occurrence of Murghabo-Bactrian and Murghabo-Bactrian imitated artefacts from the Gulf as a result of the southern Gulf cultures being included in this migratory system, being part of the network linking Central Baluchistan and the coastal regions of southeastern Iran and Pakistani Baluchistan? But it still remains to be seen whether Pakistani Baluchistan or the Bampur Valley region did indeed provide an easy corridor for cultural and economic contacts with the Arabian Gulf. On the other hand, there is overwhelming evidence of a reorientation of external relations in Oman and a new political, cultural/economic power on the scene in the Arabian Peninsula around 2100 B.C.: the Indus Civilization 54). The latter most likely had direct connections with the Murghabo-Bactrian world, also involving the Harappan metallurgy55) and 52) During Caspers forthc. 53) Kohl and Pottier (in press). 54) S.

It would be beyond the scope of this short paper to enumerate all the Indus or Indus-influenced materials discovered so far min the Arabian Peninsula and on the Islands of Bahrain and Failaka, but it seems pertinent to point to the existence of a late third millennium Harap- pan trading post at Ras al-Junayz on the eastern coast of Oman56) and evidence of additional permanent Indus traces to the north of this settlement 57). Pottery fragments with inscribed Indus script, comparable to inscribed pottery fragments from Indus Valley sites, in these localities still have not been properly published, but once we are inm a position to read the Indus script they may prove to be of crucial importance in evaluating the mercantile potentialities of this late Indus presence in southeastern Arabia. On page 46 reference was made to the discovery of a typical 'Central Asian' 'chopping-knife' also discovered in a late Umm an-Nar, viz. a late third millennium, context at Tell Abraq. The coexistence of this 'chopping- knife' and the possible Harappan blade-axe mentioned earlier in a late third millennium B.C. context at the settlement site of Tell Abraq may well indicate that the Indus Valley presence in the Arabian Gulf towards the close of the third millennium B.C. could, at least partly, be responsible for the introduction of Murghabo-Bactrian material into the region. 56) M.
