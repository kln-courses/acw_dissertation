<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 5: Kim Stanley robinson’s Mars Trilogy Kim Stanley robinson’s mars Trilogy Kim Stanley robinson’s Science in the Capitol trilogy (2004; 2005; 2007)  explores socio-political responses to climate change on earth in a  near-future setting, and features instances of geoengineering as a form  of climate change mitigation. 2312 (2012) is set in a far-future solar  system made habitable by a plethora of space habitats and terraformed  planets, but it is with robinson’s groundbreaking Mars trilogy (1996c  [1992]; 1996b [1993]; 1996a) that this study of terraforming ends. This  trilogy engages in a dialogue over the cultural meaning of mars, space  exploration and terraforming. its portrayal of mars colonisation mirrors  the structure of secessionist politics seen in such works as Ecotopia,  which it uses to explore alternative socio-political arrangements. as  Carol franko explains, ‘fiction is for [robinson] the crucial realm for  the human activity of asserting and testing values’ (1997, 59). as in  Ecotopia, the alternative practices experimented with in the new space  of mars begin to establish a feedback loop with the earth of the text.  one theme of the terraforming narrative is that of ‘throwing together,’  the combination of elements from many disciplines to establish the  technical, social, political and economic basis for creating self-sustaining  life-support systems on other planets. The Mars trilogy incorporates overt environmental ethical reflection  and brings this to bear against the industrial exploitation of mars by  multinationals that see it as a resource offering raw materials and a space  for capitalist investment and development. earth is forced to respond  to the negative effects of climate change from a correspondingly global  perspective, as the catastrophic effects of ecological disaster impact all  the planet’s population. The pastoral collectives that Bakhtin identifies  are represented as nested collections of spaces, often associated with  contesting positions that are developed throughout the narrative. The  chronotope of the interplanetary mine in the Mars trilogy is connected  to debates regarding the preservation of alien planets as wilderness areas,  168 </page> <page sequence="2"> Kim STanLeY roBinSon’S MARS TriLogY 169 idylls where humanity’s socio-political struggles have not yet reached.  The growing politico-economic primacy of multinationals throughout  the trilogy contrasts with the initial nationalist interest in terraforming:  the colonists known as the first Hundred, although ethnically diverse,  represent the joint – and paranoid – agendas of america and russia. Later  colonists from China, Japan, Switzerland and other countries, as well  as various arabic groups who derive their identity from religio-cultural  sources (for example, Bedouin and Sufi), emigrate to mars, introducing  further nationalistic and cultural considerations to terraforming. Jed rasula has reconceived the intertextual aspect of american poetry  as a metaphorical compost library. He argues that newness arises from  the continual recycling of language, shaped by an author’s attentiveness  to predecessor texts and by reader interaction: ‘[i]n the compost library  books have a way of collapsing into each other, not in the improvements  of more “authoritative” editions or versions, but by constant recycling.  not one but many energies shape the field. it is a vortex’ (2002, 17).  Thierry Bardini argues that biological entities and processes are the  ultimate junk, and that terraforming represents a prime example of  composting for the creation of new forms and systems (2013). Bardini’s  sense of junk is rhizomatic; it is ‘all kinds of stuff that grows in stacks  and patiently waits for a renewed use’ (2011, 7). rasula and Bardini  explore the questions of the ecological imperative of american poetry  on the one hand and of junk as ‘one of the signatures of this age’ on  the other (Bardini, 2011, 24), but both concepts, compost and junk,  share this tendency towards exaptation in order to create newness in  ways that add value. Stephen J. gould’s term ‘exaptation,’ as Stuart a. Kauffman explains  in his provocative Investigations, refers to the way in which the biological  structures of Darwinian pre-adaptations evolve into new structures  with capacities that, in many cases, could not have been pre-stated  or predicted. Kauffman explains that ‘in an appropriate environment  a causal consequence of a part of an organism that had not been of  selective significance might come to be of selective significance and  hence be selected’ (2000, 130). metaphorical examples of this process  of exaptation for literary purposes are compatible with a Bakhtinian  view of language and with Broderick’s view of the megatext, but they  emphasise the specifically evolutionary and ecological character of this  intertextuality. They can be linked to Brian attebery’s notion of the  ‘parabola,’ a trajectory rooted in an iconic sf image that, appearing in  a form subject to collaboration and jazz-like improvisation, is open to  inventive variation: ‘the sf scenario is an open curve, a swing toward the  unknown’ (2005, 14). The term joins this notion of a narrative trajectory  </page> <page sequence="3"> 170 Terraforming to that of the parable, thus drawing attention to how the sf narrative  ‘combine[s] human interactions with scientific ideas and technological  innovations in a meaningful way’ (attebery and Hollinger, 2013, viii). Terraforming is a suitable motif for this view of the megatext as  compost or junk: the emphasis that it places on the creation of soil, in  stories such as robert Heinlein’s Farmer in the Sky (1967 [1950]) through  to michael allaby and James Lovelock’s The Greening of Mars (1984) and  robinson’s Mars trilogy, establishes a connection to this notion of the  fertility of the composting aspect of the library of texts – a fertility at  once open and oriented towards the unknown. Percival Lowell’s popular- isation in the 1890s of his theory that the canali of mars, identified by  giovanni Schiaparelli in 1877, were the traces of an irrigation system  engineered by martians to combat the resource scarcity of a dying planet  adds another resonance to this notion of mars and terraforming as a  site for the composting of junk, that blend of romance and science that  has informed the popular imagination of mars since the late nineteenth  century (Crossley, 2011, 73). robert Crossley in Imagining Mars (2011)  provides an excellent and extensive examination of the compost library  of the martian megatext and of the meaning of mars as created by  a complex relationship between science and the literary and popular  imagination. robinson’s Mars trilogy explores the fusion between the physical  adaptation of the environment and the transformation of social practices  and institutions. it considers the terraforming motif and its emphasis on  closed life-support systems and soil, linking these physical parameters to  an ‘eco-economic’ system propounded by the martian colonists of the  trilogy. exploring how this system offers elements for exaptation from  earth’s compost library of socio-economic and political practices and  attitudes, this chapter considers the role of the martian landscape as a  distorted mirror of earth that offers to transform and revitalise a planet  consumed by tensions that exacerbate the global ecological crisis on a  near-future earth. eric otto discusses the trilogy’s exploration of aldo  Leopold’s ‘The Land ethic,’ a classic work of environmental philosophy  that proposes the extension of ethical consideration to non-human  nature and which negotiates the space between science, economics,  expediency and ethics (2003). responding to ernest J. Yanarella’s  criticism that the polyphony of subject positions in the trilogy allows  robinson to avoid resolving the ethical debate surrounding terraforming  (2001), otto argues that the work’s multiple perspectives ‘encourage  readers to synthesize continually a complex array of political positions’  (2003, 132). more recently, otto has explored the ways in which  environmental sf intersects with transformative environmentalism, that  </page> <page sequence="4"> Kim STanLeY roBinSon’S MARS TriLogY 171 collection of environmental movements arising from the wake of rachel  Carson’s 1962 Silent Spring (2012). These movements offer analyses of and  solutions to environmental degradation, focusing, to use a cybernetic,  ecological paradigm, on the inputs that feed into environmentally  destructive behaviour, rather than on outputs that would require a  reaction to specific examples of degradation (otto, 2012, 1). Carol franko connects Bakhtinian dialogism, polyphony and the  carnivalesque to elements of Red Mars (1997) and, while William  J. Burling argues that franko’s insights cannot be usefully applied to the  political process of Blue Mars (2005, 76), robinson himself mentions in  an interview that franko offered ‘a clear theoretical expression’ of his  aim that ‘actually helped me in figuring out certain problems in Blue  Mars’ (see mcVeigh, 1995, 4). in contrast, Burling argues persuasively for  affinities between the political process outlined in Blue Mars and ernesto  Laclau and Chantal mouffe’s ‘radical democracy,’ points of contact that  are coherent with notions of dialogism and polyphony and that extend  franko’s analysis (2005). for robinson, sf’s environmental engagement  possesses utopian dimensions: the Mars books are ‘an attempt to take  back the [utopian] territory – to show that the future is malleable and  up to us’ (see Buhle, 2002, 88). approaching robinson’s work from the perspective of composting  is fruitful for exploring the connections between american ecological  poetry and sf that he makes: as a former student of gary Snyder and a  dedicated burrower into a compost heap that includes american poets  such as Thoreau and emerson, along with frederick Turner himself,  robinson states in an interview that ‘i believe that science-fiction is  one of the most powerful modes of poetry of all time. Science-fiction  is just a metaphor for the world we live in and metaphor is one of the  basic tools of poetry’ (see Cooke, 1995). The martian colony’s attempt  to establish a sustainable environment on mars involves the creation of  new myths exapted from experiences and systems of thought on earth.  in the context of the martian environment, these narratives are tuned  to the new specificities of a developing compost library. The creation  of new myths on mars enshrines a martian narrative that offers the  potential for feedback from the alien to the human in order to transform  the multiple voices embedded in earthbound history into new avenues  for socio-cultural experimentation. </page> <page sequence="5"> 172 Terraforming Gardens on Mars images of the garden appear as indicators of the drastic transformations  that terraforming brings to mars. in Blue Mars, Sax russell is taken on a  tour of Tyrrhena massif near Sabishii, where the shaping of the martian  landscape prior to terraforming is described as ‘[n]ot chaos, technically  speaking, but wild, speaking its unimaginable age in polyglot profusion’  (robinson, 1996a, 89). This polyglossia is influenced by the geologic and  meteorological forces that have shaped the planet for billions of years.  after his guides point out the colonising plant life, russell understands  that ‘it was all fellfield, the whole Tyrrhena massif,’ an ‘intensively  cultivated’ pastoral space (90). Strongly recalling Turner’s depiction of  mars as a garden, russell’s guides explain that various cultural gardening  aesthetics are deployed, ranging from the Japanese Zen of muso Soseki  and others to fu Hsi’s feng shui, the designs of Persian gardening gurus  such as omar Khayyam and the approaches of american ecologists  such as Leopold, Wes Jackson and the biologist oskar Schnelling. These  voices serve as springboards for new visions of the landscape that have  co-evolved with mars’s topology and climate, an ecopoietic technique  that embeds humanity into the landscape through the co-adaptation of  its gardening strategies with the land. russell observes that the landscape  is built from a polyphony of voices, ‘an aesthetic journey, filled with  allusions and subtle variants of tradition that were invisible to him’  (91). These gardens represent the colonists’ experimentation with the  gardening practices of the past, a palimpsest of various aesthetic principles  that speak of the legacy left to the martians by earth. These scenes are  themselves part of the compost heap of the sf megatext, echoing Turner’s  depiction in Genesis of a garden on mars built on the aesthetic practices  of a multiplicity of cultures and stances towards the landscape. The soil  for this riot of gardening techniques, however, is imported from earth,  illustrating another dimension to the colonists’ continuing dependence  on their home planet, despite the level of political and economic  independence they have achieved (90). for russell’s guides, ecopoiesis is ‘terraforming redefined, subtilized,  localized. Transmuted into something like Hiroko’s areoformation’  (robinson, 1996a, 91). moving from the global to the local, ecopoiesis  re-visioned as gardening connects terrestrial landscapes to the primeval  martian planet, resulting in modifications to both. Like the areophany,  this process is one of ‘[c]oevolution, a kind of epigenetic development’  that subtly redefines the boundaries of the martian land as an experiment  in building homes that respect nature’s otherness (91). While russell  initially views ecopoiesis as an unmediated process where the initial  </page> <page sequence="6"> Kim STanLeY roBinSon’S MARS TriLogY 173 conditions are established by human agency (‘let loose the seeds, then  watch it all develop on its own. Self-organizing ecologies’; 92), russell’s  guides see ‘mars [as] all a garden. earth too for that matter. This is  what humans have become. So we have to think about gardening, about  that level of responsibility to the land. a human-mars interface that  does justice to both’ (91). echoing Sargent’s Venus trilogy, this view of  terraforming as gardening is an interface that mediates between human  communities and non-human nature. at Shining mesa, along the banks of a stream fed by meltwater from  the marineris canyon floors, ‘forest galleries were springing up’ whose  ‘balsa canopies were allowing a great number of plant and animal species  to flourish underneath them’ (robinson, 1996a, 379, 380). according  to nirgal’s acquaintances, ‘it was the most diverse biotic community on  mars’ (380). This landscape signals the extent of the transformations  mars has undergone after colonisation. nirgal’s tour of Shining mesa  takes place alongside an internal struggle over two conflicting modes of  inhabiting the land – between the nomadic lifestyle he is familiar with  and the settled life of a home: ‘[h]e wanted to live in the open air. To  learn a patch of land, its soil and plants and animals and weather and  skies, and everything else’ (382–83). Candor Chasma is too sublime  a location, too much a wilderness, for individuals to establish roots  and inhabit the land. nirgal therefore decides to resume his search for  the absent Hiroko, thus allowing the narrative to explore the physical  changes to the martian landscape on the now blue mars. nirgal’s view of the elysium massif strait is like nothing he has ever  seen before: ‘water, the sea, a whole future world’ (robinson, 1996a, 390).  During this search he realises that the familiar primeval mars is gone.  His childhood companions encourage him to stop looking for Hiroko, and  he decides instead to ‘look at the land,’ prompting a return to Tyrrhena  massif to try his hand at gardening (396). Thus, he moves from a nomadic  to a settled lifestyle: ‘[h]e would be an ecopoet,’ but ‘[f]irst he had to learn  the land’ (398, 399). nirgal becomes the steward of a small basin, where  ‘working out one’s locality’s connections to the larger region was a big  part of the ongoing process of ecopoesis [sic]’ (400). as he cultivates his  allocated basin, a microcosm of the plant and animal life that continues  to be established at Tyrrhena massif, a ‘Tyrrhena committee on the  introduction of new species’ visits nirgal in order to establish a position  towards the local ecology: ‘there was a growing sentiment to regard this  mix as “natural” to Tyrrhena, to be altered only by consensus’ (405). after  this visit, nirgal says to the marmots who have taken up residence by his  home, ‘now we’re indigenous’: on mars, being indigenous is a matter of  political consensus (405). </page> <page sequence="7"> 174 Terraforming another perspective on the transformations to mars is supplied  by ann Clayborne, whom russell accompanies on an expedition and  observes reading the landscape like a text. russell sees her as an oracle,  a visionary whose love of rock – of abiotic life – he compares to Hiroko’s  visionary areophany. He attempts to uncover the etymology of the words  ‘stone’ and ‘rock’, but quickly abandons himself to a mars landscaped  as a tabula rasa, a seemingly boundless space invested with a creative  potentiality directed towards the future. Such a view contrasts with his  thinking about the etymology of the word ‘garden’. Derived from the  old norse gard for enclosure, it ‘[s]eemed to share origins with guard,  or keeping’ (robinson, 1996a, 92), thus resonating with the image of  the dome as a protective enclosure. The rocky martian land is a space  opposed to the cultivation of gardens seen in Tyrrhena massif and the  banks of the arena glacier: ‘[w]ithout active gardening, this was what  one got’ (100). The encroaching plant life is a source of anger and  depression for Clayborne, who interprets it as the destruction of mars.  michel, a psychologist and member of the first Hundred, encourages  her to walk amongst the changed martian landscape and argues that  terraforming has made humankind a part of the land and its ecology,  essentially embedding them into a new home. for Clayborne, michel  suggests, ‘[y]our task becomes seeing the Mars that always endures’ (257). encouraged by this suggestion, Clayborne embarks on a walkabout  to rediscover her relationship to the now altered mars. Her encounter  with the new landscape brings her face to face with an ecology imported  from earth, the short food chains of the antarctic comprising marine,  avian and mammalian life. along with the image of skuas scavenging  a dead seal, Clayborne sees a polar bear, which gives chase to her after  feeding from the same carcass. This pivotal encounter introduces a new  vantage to her consciousness: ‘[s]he only had to close her eyes and  she saw again that heraldic image of the bear flowing over the rock;  but open them and there the dashboard gleamed, bright and artificial  and familiar. ah so strange!’ (robinson, 1996a, 268). for Clayborne,  the image of the polar bear is an emblem for change: it is a haunting  vision that initiates a transformation that eventually allows her to step  back from her nihilism, preparing her for a modified relationship to  the new mars. ‘Stepping Back’ The environmental philosopher Holmes rolston iii identifies two  broad categories of worldview around which debate over the aesthetic  </page> <page sequence="8"> Kim STanLeY roBinSon’S MARS TriLogY 175 appreciation of nature revolves: ‘one that aesthetic experience must be  participatory, relating an actual beholder to a landscape; the other that  nature is objective to such beholders, actually known in the physical  and biological sciences’ (1995, 377). Considering the question of whether  aesthetic appreciation of landscapes needs to be science-based, rolston  compares those various and diverse examples of what he calls ‘presci- entific’ approaches to nature which, on the one hand, characteristically  misunderstand nature (from the point of view of scientific objectivity),  while on the other have developed specific ways of relating to that  nature based on human co-adaptation with the environment. rolston  reflects on the assumption that ‘no one appreciates the canyon, for  what it really is, unless helped by geologists’ (374) and argues that ‘[s] cience cultivates the habit of looking closely, as well as of looking for  long periods of time. one is more likely to experience the landscape  at multiple scales of both time and space’ (376). nevertheless, he is  well aware of the problems of contingency associated with this claim,  noting that ‘science or no science, everyone can gain some of that  sensitivity’ (377). Kauffman sees the relationship between science and story as one in  which science itself can be made richer by incorporating storytelling  into its practice. He argues that ‘[t]he propagating exapting biosphere is  getting on with it, and it appears that we crucially need stories to do  some of the telling of that getting on with it’ (Kauffman, 2000, 135).  Kauffman explains that ‘[s]tories are our mode of making sense of the  context-dependent actions of us as autonomous agents. and metaphor?  if we cannot deduce it all, if the biosphere’s ramblings are richer than  the algorithmic, then metaphor must be part of our cognitive capacity  to guide action in the absence of deduction’ (Kauffman, 2000, 135).  Thomas Heyd suggests that the aesthetic appreciation of nature need  not rely on science and that science may actually be harmful to such  appreciation because it directs attention to the ‘theoretical level and  the general case,’ rather than to ‘the personal level and the particular  case that we actually need to engage’ (2001, 126). Heyd argues that the  ‘aesthetic appreciation of nature should be guided by a great variety of  stories from a diversity of walks of life and cultures because this enriches  our capacity to appreciate nature aesthetically’ (137). interplanetary  imperialism, a tradition substrating such classics as ray Bradbury’s The  Martian Chronicles (1958 [1950]) and Heinlein’s The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress  (2001 [1966]), has traditionally interpreted cosmological nature as a field  for american conquest and annexation. Sf has simultaneously challenged  this imperialism, a trend that feeds into robinson’s exploration of  human–nature relations in his terraforming trilogy. </page> <page sequence="9"> 176 Terraforming robinson’s Mars trilogy portrays a not unfamiliar earth subject to  overpopulation, pollution, global warming, rising sea levels, war, famine  and severe economic and political inequalities between the rich and  poor, a list that matches glen Love’s list of contemporary environmental  problems (2003, 14–15). These ecological changes effect social, political  and economic repercussions. in Red Mars, a group of one hundred  scientists known as the first Hundred begin terraforming mars in 2027.  The text foregrounds the importance of, and problems associated with,  opening spaces for dialogue in two ways: first, by utilising different  perspectives to focalise each section and, second, by portraying the social  activity of the colonists from these alternating perspectives. This involves  depiction of the confrontations and differences of ideology between  opposed groups or individuals. The machiavellian frank Chalmers  recognises the importance of exchange between opposed positions when  orchestrating his rival’s assassination in Red Mars’s opening sequence. He  thinks of his chosen assassin as a ‘fool [...] talk means everything. We are  nothing but information exchange, talk is all we have!’ (robinson, 1996c,  31). Chalmers’s plan for political dominance involves sowing discord  between cultural groups. By manipulating the historical antagonisms  between arab and american nationalism, Chalmers sabotages any  attempt towards dialogue. raising awareness of and support for political  positions and lifestyles is a major narrative component and is conducted  through discussion, campaigning and interviews, further reflecting the  importance of information exchange. as multiple individuals and groups  attempt to define the martian landscape according to their own values,  the exchange and conflict between their contesting positions establish a  literary ecology that opens a space for debate over the meaning of mars. Central to the Mars trilogy is the depiction of a developing martian  community and its struggle for political independence from earth. one  view of mars is purely instrumental in the sense that it is seen only  as a means to relieve the pressures threatening earth’s population. in  response to uprisings on mars the official line from earth’s governments  is that ‘“mars is not a nation but a world resource”’ (robinson, 1996c,  602). This perspective is directly connected to the mining that had  begun earlier in antarctica, a space that, as a natural reserve, has been  protected from such activities by the 1961 antarctic Treaty. Clayborne  places the blame for the breach of this treaty squarely on the colonists’  efforts to terraform mars: she explains that ‘[t]hey kept mining and oil  out of antarctica for almost a hundred years [...] [b]ut when terraforming  began here it all collapsed’ (298). This view of nature as a resource highlights technology’s influence  in redefining humanity’s treatment of external space. The chronotope  </page> <page sequence="10"> Kim STanLeY roBinSon’S MARS TriLogY 177 of the first colonising outpost in Red Mars implies a series of narrative  trajectories that draw upon the pastoral opposition between images of  the ‘natural’ landscape of the country and the technological city. as  Bakhtin explains, the chronotope is the artistic representation of space  and time as interrelated in a text; time qualifies spatial meanings and  vice versa. This representation, because linguistic, allows it to accrue  a series of human-centric meanings from structures internal to the  text and through sf’s megatext, a repository of discourse constructed  by works in the sf tradition and by reader interaction with those  works. russell’s assessment of terraforming is cast in doubt in the  light of nadia Cherneshevsky’s trip with Clayborne to the north polar  region. on her return, she sees their habitat in a new light: ‘[i]t had  the disordered, functional, ugly look of Vanino or Usman or any of  the Stalinist heavy industry cities in the Urals, or the oil camps of  Yakut. They rolled through a good five kilometers of this devastation’  (robinson, 1996c, 191). The description of the outpost taps into the  narrative potential of the dystopia, the alternative to the possibility of  a utopian interplanetary colony. This theme contributes to the ongoing  debate regarding the development of new societies on other worlds. it  constructs an image of a repressive society signified by the chronotope  of the city as wasteland, delineating a socio-political structure that  rejects heteroglossic dialogue that would incorporate all the voices of  the multiple groups who work towards constructing a new martian  identity. greater control of the environment is thus accompanied by a greater  willingness to adapt the landscape for purely anthropocentric ends:  nature’s otherness does not feature as a constraint to terraforming.  Cherneshevsky responds to the environment instrumentally, although  this response is personal rather than economic. When Clayborne invites  her to a trip to mars’s polar regions, she sees the wilderness of the  martian landscape and experiences a cognitive shift that allows her to  re-evaluate this space. She thinks that ‘[a]ll this beauty was so strange,  so alien,’ and the narrator continues: ‘nadia had never seen it properly  before, or never really felt it, she realized that now; she had been  enjoying her life as if it were a Siberia made right, living in a huge  analogy, understanding everything in terms of her past’ (robinson,  1996c, 171). recognising the alien aspect of mars’s landscape helps  her identify her own tendency to project meaning onto nature and so  ameliorate its otherness. Cherneshevsky’s identification of mars with  Siberia instantiates a landscape that is completely constituted by her  imposition of meaning. Her initial view of mars as a new Siberia is  instrumental because it allows her to cope with the deterritorialisation  </page> <page sequence="11"> 178 Terraforming that accompanies the unfamiliarity of, and the demands of living within,  an alien landscape. Here we see the pastoral refigured: by contrasting the alien with  the familiar, its strangeness is raised to the level of awareness, drawing  attention to how mars is unlike familiar natural landscapes. it signifies  the new; civilisation on earth is shifted to a nostalgic past. Cherneshevsky  responds to the intuition that mars is not solely a field for the imposition  of her engineering discipline, thus overlaying the chronotope of the  martian wilderness with non-instrumental value. This episode draws  on the mystique of mars, constructed, as russell notes, from ‘[a]ll those  dumb sci-fi novels with their monsters and maidens and dying civili- zations. and all the scientists who studied the data, or got us here,’  but it challenges conventional ideas of beauty, pushing us as readers to  reflect on a personal, aesthetic response to a nature not already conceived  of as determined by instrumental cultural expectations (robinson,  1996c, 212). Through Cherneshevsky’s experiences of the ‘real’ martian  landscape, an ecologically oriented perspective is woven into the dialogue  of the text and stands out as one of its major ideological voices. Cherneshevsky’s approach is indicative of general trends towards  landscaping mars. Hailwood focuses particular attention on what he calls  ‘a kind of intellectual fragility involved with the difficulty of maintaining  natural otherness in view: the ease with which it is overlooked in the  cultural process of feeling at home and secure in a landscape’ (2004, 29).  earth’s view of mars as a resource exemplifies a landscape that prefigures  and justifies physical terraforming. Clayborne reflects that ‘[o]nly on  mars did they walk about in a horrendous mishmash of the dreams of  the past, causing who knew what disastrous misapprehensions of the  real terrain’ (robinson, 1996b, 155). Such ‘disastrous misapprehensions’  disrespect nature’s otherness and demonstrate the failure to recognise the  constructivism inherent in landscaping. Clayborne and Cherneshevsky are  both aware that such cultural projections are ways in which continuity  with the past is maintained. an awareness of intellectual landscaping  processes allows Cherneshevsky to acknowledge that physical space is  not solely constituted by anthropomorphic perspectives. franko argues that intersubjectivity is central to two of robinson’s  short stories (1994), ‘exploring fossil Canyon’ and ‘green mars,’ collected  in the Mars trilogy’s companion volume The Martians (2000 [1999]). They  ‘explore the subjective processes that shape such debates [about nature’s  value] and suggest that the most important moments of growth are those  that involve a crisis in one’s perception of otherness, and that such crises  open the way for the discovery of a social utopian impulse, one that  responds to otherness, human and non-human’ (franko, 1994, 199).  </page> <page sequence="12"> Kim STanLeY roBinSon’S MARS TriLogY 179 ‘instrumental’ is a term from environmental philosophy that refers to  the way in which we value nature, and it forms one of the dimensions  of the concept of nature’s otherness. Hailwood argues that ‘the value  conferred by nature’s otherness is best thought of as non-instrumental  (independent nature is a “negative end” [a constraint] in virtue of  its otherness), extrinsic and objective’ (2004, 13). its value is located  ‘extrinsically’ by virtue of the fact that it is other to humanity. nature’s  otherness also has objective value, and here Hailwood adopts Thomas  nagel’s conception of objectivity, which he describes as ‘a method of  understanding from a detached perspective, formed by stepping back  from an initial view to arrive at a new conception taking in the original  and its relation to the world’ (52). in this light, Bakhtin’s notion of transgredience, the practice of  assuming an external perspective as a mode of consciousness, can  be considered a form of objectivity in the sense that nagel describes.  evaluating the self from the perspective of nature’s otherness offers  an avenue for overcoming anthropocentrism and for developing new  ethical relations with nature (murphy, 2011, 156). Cherneshevsky’s  cognitive shift is an example of this process of ‘stepping back’ and  reconsidering one’s relationship to the environment. There are other  implications involved with this conception of objectivity: Hailwood cites  nagel’s explanation that ‘“[t]he wider the range of subjective types to  which a form of understanding is accessible – the less it depends on  specific subjective capacities – the more objective it is,”’ but notes that,  to avoid nihilism, ‘[n]ormative realism [...] requires the retention of  some relatively subjective element’ (2004, 52). objectivity is therefore  dependent upon the convergence of multiple subjectivities, yet this  process exists in tension with individual subjective perspectives that allow  individuals to evaluate and develop a range of new ethical relationships  to nature and to regulate a potential regress towards nihilism. The debate between the reds and greens is fundamental to the  trilogy and is represented by the opposition between the geologist  Clayborne and russell, the physicist turned biotechnologist. in Red Mars  they confront each other and establish their initial positions towards  terraforming. Clayborne argues that ‘you’re going to wreck the historical  record, destroy the polar caps, and the outflow channels, and the canyon  bottoms – destroy a beautiful pure landscape, and for nothing at all’  (robinson, 1996c, 212). While Clayborne’s emphasis on the physical  fragility of natural features apparently supports an intrinsic view of  nature’s otherness, her discussion of the geological ‘historical record’  and an aesthetic of beauty suggest that this is otherwise. russell, on  the other hand, argues that </page> <page sequence="13"> 180 Terraforming Changing it won’t destroy it. reading its past might get harder,  but the beauty of it won’t go away. if there are lakes, or forests,  or glaciers, how does that diminish mars’s beauty? i don’t think  it does. i think it only enhances it. it adds life, the most beautiful  system of all [...] mars will always remain mars, different from  earth, colder and wilder. (robinson, 1996c, 213) russell places value on aesthetic aspects of the landscape, but for him  only biotic processes – organisms and ecologies – have extrinsic aesthetic  value. He recognises the presence of otherness as a component of nature  on mars and he distinguishes nature’s otherness from an alien nature’s  otherness. Clayborne is dissatisfied with russell’s more popular position  but is unable to effectively articulate a response, demonstrating the  difficulty involved in speaking for the rights of abiotic nature. She does,  however, attempt such a defence: i think you value consciousness too high, and rock too little. We  are not lords of the universe. We’re one small part of it. We may  be its consciousness, but being the consciousness of the universe  does not mean turning it all into a mirror image of us. it means  rather fitting into it as it is, and worshipping it with our attention.  [...] You’ve never even seen mars. (robinson, 1996c, 213–14) Clayborne advocates an attention to nature’s otherness that is almost  religious, criticising the anthropocentric landscaping that follows from  the view of humanity as ‘lords of the universe.’ She sees terraforming  as imperial in its approach to nature when she completes russell’s claim  that ‘[d]eciding to go to mars is like the first phrase of a sentence,  and the whole sentence says—’ by saying ‘Veni, vidi, vinci’ (robinson,  1996c, 56). This ‘sentence,’ the narrative of interplanetary colonisation  that seems to demand resolution in familiar ways, is the political  landscape that informs terraforming. This position is distinct from her  earlier emphasis on aesthetic beauty and is intrinsic in the sense that  the value of nature’s otherness is not dependent on its relationship to  humankind. it is nevertheless extrinsic in that an appropriate response  to the universe is one of paying attention and of ‘fitting into it as it  is,’ which does depend on recognising it as other from humanity’s  perspective. Clayborne’s view in this pivotal episode involves extrin- sically valuing landscapes in the manner of Hailwood’s notion of  nature’s otherness. robinson’s Mars trilogy attempts to negotiate new  relationships to a nature already intellectually landscaped with meaning. This relation of extrinsic worth is confused, however, because russell  </page> <page sequence="14"> Kim STanLeY roBinSon’S MARS TriLogY 181 refers to Clayborne’s position as advocating intrinsic worth, as when he  thinks that ‘she believed in some kind of intrinsic worth for the mineral  reality of mars’ (robinson, 1996b, 186). russell fails to understand  Clayborne’s arguments; Green Mars and Blue Mars are partly concerned  with his decision to step back from and re-evaluate his initial position,  partly to better understand Clayborne’s own perspective and partly to  attempt to convince her that the terraforming project has its own kind  of value. on a walking trip with Clayborne in Blue Mars he realises  that ‘[o]ne had to let things speak for themselves. This was perhaps  true of all phenomena. nothing could be spoken for. one could only  walk over the land, and let it speak for itself’ (robinson, 1996a, 98).  if, however, it is not possible to speak for the landscape, how do you  convince those who disrespect nature’s otherness to maintain a green  (or rather red) perspective if not by relating its value in some way to  humanity? accepting nature’s otherness as an extrinsic value is one way  in which characters begin to recognise existences external to humanity.  Clayborne’s advocacy and, eventually, russell’s focus on viewing the  landscape open up other textual spaces where appropriate responses to  the environment are explored. The red/green positions splinter into a variety of mediations  between these two extremes, and russell comes to question his initial  orientation. Setting the narrative on the red planet allows the ideological  connotations of ‘green’ as a label for environmental consciousness to be  inverted, with it coming to represent the interests of an unreflecting  and destructive process. That these values have led earth to its current  environmental and political crisis allows us to question further our  notions of an acceptable interplanetary environmental consciousness.  These values also lead us to consider the symbolic value of terraforming  and to explore the implication that terraforming leads to a mirroring of  the socio-political dynamics on earth. Space is thus politicised as groups  struggle to define the meaning of mars and their relationship to it. Clayborne and russell exemplify the way in which language is  used to speak for the martian landscape from perspectives that view  it as a site of traditional symbolic value and from contesting positions,  contributing to the definition of textual spaces for the confrontation  and interaction of different discourses. russell views mars as lifeless  and therefore ripe for the seeding of life, a traditional sf theme.  Clayborne sees terraforming in terms resonating with the american  pastoral, with the martian landscape occupying the role of pristine  wilderness. These values are represented synchronically, as spaces that  are placed in juxtaposition to each other: Clayborne and russell embody  contesting views towards the martian landscape, while Chalmers  </page> <page sequence="15"> 182 Terraforming considers it a space in which to manoeuvre for political dominance.  However, through the diachronic structure of a text (narration and  character dialogue), these and other positions come into contact with  one another to allow an implied audience to consider and question the  value systems represented. Different characters may express contesting  positions towards a particular landscape that can be read against the  implied authorial voice. as russell’s reassessment of his initial position  shows, characters may be exposed to different ideological worlds in their  attempt to reconcile the discourses that these landscapes are made to  represent. Confrontations with nature’s otherness deterritorialise and  thus allow characters to step back, enabling them to develop alternative  ways of valuing their environment. Visions Reflected Back to Earth While visiting the alps nirgal experiences the realisation that ‘earth  was so vast that in its variety it had regions that even out-marsed mars  itself – that among all the ways that it was greater, it was greater even  at being Martian’ (robinson, 1996a, 201). This impression is generated  by the similarities and differences of climate between the alps and a  terraformed mars, one in which nirgal, as one of the first children born  on mars, feels at home in. antarctica, as we learn in the opening of Red  Mars, is also ‘a landscape that was almost as cold and harsh as Mars itself,’  which explains why it functions as the selection and training site for  the first Hundred prior to their journey to mars (robinson, 1996c, 41).  What this relation highlights is the presence of nature’s otherness in all  landscapes. even on earth, where many spaces are significantly modified  by physical and psychological cultural adaptations, an element of this  otherness remains, reminding the reader that human ends and values  do not exist in isolation from the natural world. nirgal is martian and  so earth for him represents an alien planet; this perspective offers the  reader an opportunity to engage in nagel’s process of stepping back and  reassessing their subjective view of nature’s otherness in the familiar  landscapes of earth. The Mars trilogy argues that a reliance on technological fixes as an  answer to societal conflict is inadequate. Championed by the russian  arkady Bogdanov and the american John Boone, a break with history  becomes one of the driving goals of the more politically minded on  mars. They believe that the social patterns on earth are responsible  for many of the ills that humanity faces and that nothing but a  complete overhaul will do: a discarding of those that are unhelpful and  </page> <page sequence="16"> Kim STanLeY roBinSon’S MARS TriLogY 183 destructive and a retaining of those that speak for cultural pluralism  and a new martian identity that offers the colonists a global identity  distinct from earth. Boone, after many discussions with Bogdanov,  advocates ‘a new martian way, a new martian philosophy, economics,  religion!’ (robinson, 1996c, 410). This call for a new outlook alludes  to isaac asimov’s short story ‘The martian Way’ (1974 [1952]), and is  one of the central ideas of sf narratives of terraforming. This theme  takes its place in an ongoing debate that addresses issues of economic  and socio-political independence on earth. This economic independence  is linked to a martian perspective where local forms of community,  along with the appropriate forms of cultural and economic interchange  between communities, are emphasised in contrast to earth’s socio- political schisms, themselves caused by individualistic and nationalistic  perspectives towards resources and land use. Terraforming literalises  metaphors for the creation of discursive spaces to explore new forms of  local and global connectedness and identity that stand as alternatives to  destructive social formations on earth. The intersections between texts  and between generic categories such as sf, utopia and the pastoral are  heteroglossic and engage with the sf megatext and with contemporary  discourses of environmental philosophy and geopolitics. That the initial colonising outpost is built near resources deposited  from earth, including a full range of technologies built by Boeing,  rolls royce and other companies, indicates that the outpost itself and  the terraforming effort that it supports are driven by the commercial  interests of the most powerful of earth’s transnationals, a political  fact that some of the first Hundred, unlike Bogdanov, would prefer  to ignore: ‘it all comes back, and we have a return of ownership,  and prices, and wages. The little scientific station is being turned into  a mine, with the usual mining attitude toward the land over the  treasure’ (robinson, 1996c, 403). This draws on the sf megatextual  trope of technological sophistication, but associates these technologies  with familiar companies, implying one of the uncanny oscillations of  the subjunctivity of sf, which Samuel r. Delany claims is ‘blanketly  defined by: have not happened’ – an unspoken ‘yet’ may linger at the  end of that sentence (1977, 44). The chronotope of the scientific station, associated with exploration  and the scientific utopia, is shifted to that of the mine, an industrial,  capitalist image. Driving these economic interests is the application of  advanced technology as a means of securing the resources to relieve  scarcity on earth, thus allowing earth’s governments to cope with  the growing ecological crisis. The historical application of increasingly  advanced technology has enabled earth’s population to boom, resulting  </page> <page sequence="17"> 184 Terraforming in a depletion of natural resources and an amplification of the growing  crisis. The martian discovery of a treatment that can significantly prolong  human lifespans further emphasises this dynamic. Some predict that  this will increase the transnationals’ drive for economic security for  two reasons: because it will exacerbate the already problematic division  between the rich and poor, and because it will increase overpopulation  on earth: ‘if this damned treatment only goes to the rich, then the  poor will revolt and it’ll all explode – but if the treatment goes to  everyone, then populations will soar and it’ll all explode’ (robinson,  1996c, 415). mars is seen only as a space for the resolution of earth’s  ecopolitical problems. The view of the scientific station and of mars as a  mine represents the transnationals’ attempt to impose an identity based  solely on utilitarianism onto the martian landscape and its community.  Because these transnationals see mars only as a source for the extraction  of resources, and because they view this as the scientist’s only role, their  priorities for the physical adaptation of the landscape reflect an attempt  to turn the planet into a mine. The scientific community on mars is  considered only in utilitarian terms, not as a community whose lived  experience on the planet might legitimate alternative interpretations of  the landscape. The urge to make a break from the trajectory of reified ideology is  mirrored by the narrative’s discontinuity in time. Beginning in 2026,  this near-future narrative compresses the traditional gap between the  time Red Mars was published (1992) and the far-future setting of much  sf dealing with the colonisation of the solar system. Such far-future  narratives imply significant changes to socio-political structures and  technology, as Sargent’s Venus trilogy illustrates. The Mars trilogy begins  by retaining many of the structures that are now familiar and calls them  into question as the narrative progresses. it also adds further weight to  the notion that the series of crises faced on earth oscillates between  Delany’s categories of sf subjunctivity, ‘have not happened’ and ‘have  not happened yet,’ but may soon (1977, 44). The solution demonstrated  by the text’s emphasis on social relationships in a new experimental  space asserts that it is not by focusing on adapting the landscape but by  landscaping the self, by metaphorically terraforming the individual and  social aspects of a community, that the best hope for effective change is  to be realised. This is wrapped up with the martian landscape: a phrase  that appears throughout the trilogy, ‘[s]o we terraform the planet; but  the planet areoforms us,’ demonstrates that mars has a corresponding  effect on the identity of its inhabitants and suggests that there is an  influence exerted on this sense of planet from an alien nature’s radical  otherness (robinson, 1996c, 301). </page> <page sequence="18"> Kim STanLeY roBinSon’S MARS TriLogY 185 Sf taps into a range of generic forms and discourses and reconfigures  them through its own language in order to provide textual spaces for  examining human relationships to the landscape. as shown in the  foregoing discussion, this is achieved by adapting the pastoral and  utopian form in conjunction with portraying debate between positions  to consider questions of land use and responsibility towards the land.  These alternative perspectives arise from differences in physical space,  from the contrast between the planetary spaces of earth and mars and  the meaning invested in them. Local, global and interplanetary space  is constituted by ecologies of landscapes embodying multiple ideological  positions. in this way the concept of the chronotope, as a unit for the  analysis of texts, is joined to Bakhtin’s theory of dialogism, which is  especially important as it is the principle by which the megatext operates.  Dialogism and the chronotope interact to define the structure of a text;  parts interrelate to take on additional layers of meaning, and changes  to one dimension impact upon others. in the glossary of The Dialogic  Imagination dialogism is described as ‘the characteristic epistemological  mode of a world dominated by heteroglossia’: ‘[e]verything means, is  understood, as a part of a greater whole – there is a constant interaction  between meanings, all of which have the potential of conditioning  others. Which will affect the other, how it will do so and in what  degree is what is actually settled at the moment of utterance’ (Bakhtin,  2002, 426). The red/green debate and the view of technology as the  solution to ecological problems on earth are specific examples of voices  that work to condition each other. Linked to the internal ecology of a  text is an external one where individual works exist in dialogue with  others, thus contributing additional layers of meaning to the text’s  themes and images. Closed Life-Support Systems, Soil, and Cybernetics Biospheres are materially closed systems that are energetically open to  the influx from the sun. They are microcosms of larger ecological systems  on earth and are intended to function as models for the earth as a global  system. martyn J. fogg draws comparisons between contained biospheres  such as arizona’s Biosphere 2 and the uncontained biosphere of earth,  arguing that the ultimate aim of terraforming would be to create a  self-sustaining uncontained biosphere on another planet (1995). These  uncontained biospheres rely on the physical cycling of elements within  a closed system, such as hydrological cycles, various biotic cycles and  nutrient cycling through several processes. in Red Mars, the scientific team  </page> <page sequence="19"> 186 Terraforming responsible for agricultural work tinker ‘endless[ly with the] project of  maximizing the closure of their biological life support system,’ the success  of which is measured against a formula, K = I − e/E. The formula itself,  closure equals Hiroko’s constant minus the rate of incomplete closure  divided by the rate of consumption in the system, expresses the simplicity  of the closed cycle, the ideal of which would be K = I − 1, or closure equals  Hiroko’s constant minus 1. Since Hiroko’s constant is a fictional term, this  equation is important not for its scientific veracity but as an ideal with  powerful metaphorical implications for the martian colonists. The ideal  goal is acknowledged to be ‘unreachable, but asymptotically approaching  it was the farm biologists’ favorite game, and more than that, critical to  their eventual existence on mars’ (robinson, 1996c, 85). Physical life-support systems connect with others in relationships  whose complexity is compounded by cultural elements that occupy  multiple dimensions within a system of subsystems, all of which are  open. Since constituents of life-support systems include cultural aspects,  and as no system can obtain complete closure – earth is energetically  open to sunlight and radiation from the solar system and leaks gases  into space – physical and cultural systems retain a capacity for externally  influenced transformation. incomplete closure in this context is tied  to utopian thought, which robinson redefines as a process involving  continual change and not a static blueprint. robinson reflects that  ‘Joanna russ talks about changing the term from Utopia to optopia,  meaning “the optimum possible” – a continuous, dynamic process. even  Hg Wells in his Utopian writing would often talk about this kinetic  process rather than reaching any kind of stasis’ (see Cooke, 1995). This  formulation chimes with one aspect of rasula’s discussion of the compost  library, which resists closure and continually re-activates Palaeolithic  lore and historical voices in new contexts (2002). The propensity for  the sf parabola to offer a binocular vision that ‘allows us to view  stories from two perspectives at once, as both literal description and  metaphor,’ likewise resists closure through its vacillation between modes  of meaning (attebery and Hollinger, 2013, ix). Before further developing  this connection between the terraforming motif and the compost library,  it is necessary to consider the implications of the motif of compost and  soil as it figures in robinson’s terraforming trilogy. The biotic modification of mars, otherwise known as ecopoiesis,  borrows from the insights of Lovelock’s gaia hypothesis, specifically the  notion that organisms and their environment are involved in feedback  systems that regulate the environmental parameters of a planet. This  feedback system, understood as the institution of a life-support system,  must be managed on mars. ‘[N]ew life fed on the compost of their ancestors,  </page> <page sequence="20"> Kim STanLeY roBinSon’S MARS TriLogY 187 and reproduced again. Lived and died; and the soil and air left behind were  different than they were before these millions of brief generations’ (robinson,  1996c, 245). Life is involved in a bootstrapping process in which  organisms rely on the compost of their ancestors in order to thrive  and so change their environment. This image possesses a metaphorical  parallelism when ‘life’ is extended to include the colonists themselves,  whose own ability to modify mars builds upon the ‘compost’ of their  own ancestors. Bardini defines computer pioneer Douglas englebart’s  use of the term ‘bootstrapping’ as ‘an iterative and coadaptive learning  experience,’ a notion that grows out of norbert Wiener’s influential  theorisation of cybernetics (2000, 24). in Junkware, Bardini undertakes  a (bio)semiotic examination of junk Dna in terms of ‘an inquiry into  the cybernetic metaphor applied to the understanding of life, its modes  of reference, and the question of “genetic insignificance”’ (2011, 21).  ‘Junkware,’ Bardini explains, ‘is the name i chose to give this ordeal,  turning the modern industrial and postindustrial excretions into a new  sense of what being human can mean, now’ (24). This aim resonates  with that of the sf parabola, which builds on icons that are exapted in  ways that vacillate between literal and metaphorical signification without  offering definitive resolution. Lovelock’s view of earth as a gaian system builds on cybernetics and  exploits the potential for analogies to be drawn between domains implicit  in systems theory and its probabilistic approach to processes shared  by a variety of structures. rasula explores the metaphor of compost  as a figure for a geographically bounded intertextuality exemplified  by american poetry of the Black mountain school, which he notes  ‘was historically congruent with, and sometimes affiliated with, the  interdisciplinary matrix gathered around what norbert Wiener named  “cybernetics”’ (2002, 3–4). Such intertextuality hinges on what he calls  the biodegradable, transformative potential of language, and specifically  of the trope: in the tropics of american poetry, trope is the composting engine,  a fundamental dislocation, forge or furnace of a different locus:  the unpropertied space germane to language. not the mysticism of  another world, but another economy (another oikos or household) of  language-in-production, words in emanation, not nation. a tropical  poetry is an agency of partial bodies, effluvia, surplus meaning:  partial to polysemy, many-seeding. (rasula, 2002, 124) a focus on language is fundamental to Wiener’s conception of cybernetics,  concerned as it is with both communication and control acting on a  </page> <page sequence="21"> 188 Terraforming system’s capability to generate feedback and so achieve homoeostasis.  Wiener explains that ‘[i]n control and communication we are always  fighting nature’s tendency to degrade the organized and to destroy the  meaningful; the tendency, as gibbs has shown us, for entropy to increase’  (1988, 17). rasula’s description of another ‘economy [...] of language-in- production,’ of a ‘tropical poetry [...] partial to polysemy’ and imbued  with a transformative potential associated with its locus as an unfamiliar  or alien space, can be brought to bear upon robinson’s treatment of the  habitation of an alien planet and the development of living practices  that are tied to place (2002, 124). The Mars trilogy narrates a colony’s  struggle to bootstrap and develop complexity in variety and structure  as it terraforms and learns to inhabit the planet. The trajectory of this  bootstrapping process is structured like an sf parabola, as a movement  towards the unknown and as an ecological parable. The sf trope, the  motif of terraforming, is itself a composting engine in which a variety  of domains of knowledge collide and are transformed. Scientific discourse is applied to narrative considerations of soil, which  sustains important nutrient cycles that determine the potential and  the character of the organisms that are able to take root on mars. ‘[D] ifferent soils encouraged or discouraged each cycle to different degrees’  (robinson, 1996a, 340); understanding the ways in which micronutrients  like ‘iron, manganese, zinc, copper, molybdenum, boron, and chlorine’  work, along with macronutrients such as ‘carbon, oxygen, hydrogen,  nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium, and magnesium,’  becomes essential for the terraforming effort (339). given the complexity  of soil composition, the polyphonic range of soil types and the geologic  span of time that it takes for organisms to create soil, the terraformers  realise ‘[t]hey were going to have to construct soil just like they had  the magnesium bars’ (robinson, 1996c, 140). Despite the sophisticated  technologies that they have at their disposal – space elevators, solettas  (giant mirrors in orbit that reflect sunlight to the surface) and the like –  ‘manufacturing soil was one of the most difficult technical feats they had  ever undertaken’ (robinson, 1996a, 338). much of the narrative shifts  towards issues of compost, agriculture and gardening, thus allowing a  focus on landscape to dominate the text. The compost/soil motif is one  of the core images of the Mars trilogy; it is redefined as polyphonic  in terms of its vast range of types, which in turn support a range of  different organisms and, with regard to the colonists, a multiplicity of  lifestyles. it is both a literal life-support system for the colonists and a  model that functions as a parable for productive cultural and political  variation and diversity. </page> <page sequence="22"> Kim STanLeY roBinSon’S MARS TriLogY 189 Eco-Economics and the Landscape as Mirror Speaking of his alliance with a formulation of scientific socialism that  rejects nineteenth-century scientism, robinson claims that the ‘scientific’ returns as a way of talking about providing some kind  of ecological basis to economy. That way, economy is not just the  astrology of the ruling class but actually a way of calculating true  costs and benefits in a way that could be agreed on and quantified,  and therefore making clear what we are really doing – whether  it is sustainable or not over the long haul. (See Buhle, 2002, 89) it is this dislocation and movement towards another economy, one of  creation rather than depletion, that underlies Boone’s call for seeing  the terraformation and habitation of mars in terms of an eco-economic  system in a speech he delivers to his fellow colonists in Red Mars: ‘Look,’ he said, ‘here we are on mars!’ (Laughter) ‘That’s our gift  and a great gift it is, the reason we have to keep giving all our  lives to keep the cycle going, it’s like in eco-economics where what  you take from the system has to be balanced by what you give in  to it, balanced or exceeded to create that anti-entropic surge which  characterizes all creative life and especially this step across to a new  world, this place that is neither nature nor culture, transformation  of a planet into a world and then a home.[’] (robinson, 1996c, 443) a revolution for independence from earth becomes the main narrative  trajectory of the trilogy, and eco-economics becomes the basis from  which this revolution is conducted, ‘a change in practice’ from revolution  conceptualised as war (robinson, 1996b, 451). as its creators Vlad  Taneev and marina Tokareva explain, eco-economics involves consid- eration of issues of carrying capacity, co-existence, counter-adaptation,  legitimacy mechanisms and ecologic efficiency, among other ecologically  oriented issues, along with the recognition of the co-existence of  cultural and natural domains: the practice of economics on earth is  described as a ‘deformed offshoot’ of ecology (robinson, 1996c, 351).  it is a ‘synthesis of systems’ ‘based [as Vlad explains] on models from  Terran history, and its various parts have all been tested on both worlds,  and have succeeded very well’ (robinson, 1996a, 148). many of these  economic systems have been exapted from real-world systems currently  practised on earth. The microeconomics of eco-economics is borrowed  from the ‘mondragon region of Spain[, while the] different parts of  </page> <page sequence="23"> 190 Terraforming the macroeconomy have been used in the pseudo-metanat Praxis [(a  fictional corporation)], in Switzerland, in india’s state of Kerala, in  Bhutan, in Bologna italy, and in many other places, including the  martian underground itself’ (148). eco-economics is supplemented by  a barter and gift system, the former of which is based on a ‘hydrogen  peroxide economy, where things are priced by calculations of their  caloric value,’ the latter ‘a nitrogen standard’ covering ‘two planes, the  need and the gift’ (robinson, 1996b, 463). This system ties the economic practices of the martian government  directly to the life-support system of the planet. They are slowly pieced  together from a variety of economic systems from earth in a manner  that resonates with rasula’s notion of ‘wreading,’ ‘the collaborative  momentum initiated by certain texts, like the Maximus Poems, in which  the reader is enlisted as an agent of the writing,’ or a ‘nosing into the  compost library’ (2002, 11, 18). Vlad and marina explore the compost  library of economic systems, carefully selecting examples for exaptation  into a new martian economy that brings the ecological aspects of  human dependency on nature to the fore. others are also involved in  developing and testing components of this system in a dialogic process  that leaves the act of creation open. To Boone eco-economics sounds  like ‘echo economics,’ an ambiguity that emphasises the exaptation  of practices from earth’s compost library: echoes of Terran history  and storytelling that are given new life in an alien ecological system  (robinson, 1996c, 351). There is a danger that using the martian landscape as a space to  compile a new culture from earth’s compost library will overwhelm  mars’s alien otherness and undermine its own status as an independent  and autonomous nature. Clayborne warns that the result of terraforming  will be that ‘mars will be gone and we’ll be here, and we’ll wonder  why we feel so empty. Why when we look at the land we can never  see anything but our own faces’ (robinson, 1996c, 190). in this  allusion to the final story of The Martian Chronicles – in which a family  identifies themselves as martian after seeing their reflections in a stream  (Bradbury, 1958, 222) – robinson highlights how the failure to recognise  mars’s otherness results in an alienating emptiness that undermines  the possibility of reaching an identifying engagement with the land. in  contrast, Clayborne sees the planet as a space with its own meaning:  ‘[t]o see the landscape in its history, to read it like a text, written by  its own long past; that was ann’s vision, achieved by a century’s close  observation and study, and by her own native gift, her love for it’  (robinson, 1996a, 98). its geologic and climatic processes, while not  part of a life-support system of its own, leave traces of a ‘voice’ that  </page> <page sequence="24"> Kim STanLeY roBinSon’S MARS TriLogY 191 can be read with the appropriate scientific knowledge. The martian  landscape has another history, ‘the history of mars in the human mind,’  or the martian megatext, that compost library constructed in part by  science and sf and in part by older forms of knowledge about mars  (robinson, 1996c, 13). The martian landscape is a palimpsest written  upon by physical and intellectual landscaping processes; alternatively,  it is, from the perspective of some colonists, a tabula rasa without a  history, a landscape of ‘immense potential [... a] blank red slate’ (108).  The struggle over mars’s meaning is the main issue at stake in the Mars  trilogy, and it subsumes the narrative of revolution that constitutes much  of its political engagement. nirgal, one of the first generation of mars-born colonists, gives  a speech on the occasion of his visit to earth in which he suggests  that ‘mars is a mirror [...] in which Terra sees its own essence.’  Characterising mars as an expression of ‘Terran thought and Terran  genes,’ nirgal sees the purifying voyage to the planet as an opportunity  for the colonists to ‘help the home planet by serving as a way for you  to see yourselves. as a way to map out an unimaginable immensity’  (robinson, 1996a, 178). mars offers a space in which a new composting  library of practices and institutions can be explored, ideas that have  been developed through the colonists’ various relationships to mars.  Their physical relationship to the new planet prompts the development  of new socio-economic relationships and new philosophies to meet the  requirements of habitation. ‘as people learn more, [says nirgal] they  understand better their dependence on each other and on their world.  on mars we have seen that the best way to express this interdependence  is to live for giving, in a culture of compassion’ (178). This view works  as a counter to the interests of earth, whose own politico-economic  structures, dominant on mars throughout the narrative of Green Mars,  are overthrown to make way for the sifting and exaptation that goes  into creating a new human relationship to the planet during Blue Mars. Thomas J. morrissey accounts for the relationship between mars and  earth in many of the stories of the martian megatext as one in which  they are ‘bound like jealous siblings or inconstant lovers, alternately  brought together or torn asunder by intelligent but often conflicting  visions, often expressed in metaphor’ (2000, 372). earth’s ecological  failures form a background and foil for economic developments on  mars, and in the Mars trilogy eco-economics offers a challenge to  earth’s own economic systems. earth’s practices are described as a  ‘cycle of madness,’ a life-support system that is detrimental to continued  habitation (robinson, 1996b, 637). one character says of earth that  ‘[w]e have been liquidating our natural capital as if it were disposable  </page> <page sequence="25"> 192 Terraforming income, and are nearing depletion of certain capital stocks, like oil,  wood, soil, metals, fresh water, fish, and animals. This makes continued  economic expansion difficult’ (100–01). That many of the multinationals  who invest in mars intend for the planet to become a field for further  capitalist expansion, given the dwindling capital and field for growth  on earth, is testified to by their movement of corporate security forces  onto the planet and their aggressive and intrusive interference in the  lives of the workforce that they ship to mars. earth’s governments see  the red planet as a site for the relief of the population surplus and as  an answer to ecological crisis and conflict on earth. one character notes  that ‘carrying capacity was a very fuzzy abstract concept, depending on  an entire recombinant host of complexities such as soil biochemistry,  ecology, human culture’ (robinson, 1996a, 346). Carrying capacity  is thus an ecological principle that illustrates the interdependency of  physical and cultural parameters in determining the appropriate level of  strain that a life-support system can bear. earth and the multinationals  push for increased immigration quotas in order to solve the problem  of overpopulation and to create a new market for economic expansion  on mars. morrissey summarises these values and practices as part of  what he calls a ‘Dominant Social Paradigm’, which received widespread  representation in the stories of the martian megatext prior to the late  1980s–1990s, after which many texts move towards what he charac- terises as the ‘new environmental Paradigm,’ of which robinson’s own  Mars trilogy is exemplary (2000, 386). against this background, the martian revolution aims to establish  new expectations for habitation and economic practice based on scientific,  ecological principles: ‘[s]cience is creation,’ argues Sax (robinson, 1996c,  213). as the narrator notes, ‘[m]etanational capitalism’s track record at  this point did little to support it; in the last century it had precipitated  a massive war, chewed up the earth, and torn its societies apart. Why  should they not try something new, given that record?’ (robinson, 1996a,  148). examples of this movement away from the economic systems  of the past include the pseudo-metanational corporation Praxis. This  corporation aims to develop new possibilities for economic relationships  on earth, and it allies itself to the martian revolutionaries in order to  learn from the social experiments taking place there during and after  the revolution. Praxis establishes new industries on mars that engage in ecologically  oriented industrial practices: a local Praxis salvage subsidiary fittingly  named ouroboros provides an example of an economic endeavour  tuned to the necessities of maintaining a life-support system on mars:  ‘there was not a large garbage output on mars; almost everything was  </page> <page sequence="26"> Kim STanLeY roBinSon’S MARS TriLogY 193 recycled or put to use in creating agricultural soil, so each settlement’s  dump was really more of a holding facility for miscellaneous materials,  awaiting their particular reuse’ (robinson, 1996b, 131). ouroboros  ‘transforms waste into resource’ through ‘green’ nanotechnology, which  Colin milburn argues is ‘the symbol of corporate domination’ and  which, in this example, ‘is remade and remobilized as “power from  below”’ (2012, 73). This mobilisation of power can thus be seen as a  metaphorical exaptation. milburn argues that ‘robinson shows us that  science fiction is itself an instrument of environmental nanopolitics, a  molecular technology for terraforming our world and ourselves’ (57).  Terraforming and the mythic image of ouroboros offer metaphors for  an sf composting library that, through the exaptation of elements that  establish a new environmental Paradigm, is oriented towards a future  that seeks to distribute political power. morrissey notes that robinson’s Mars trilogy is engaged in a ‘search  for a vision that can sustain us in the future’ (2000, 386). mars, as  nirgal suggests, cannot save earth by functioning as a safety valve for  immigrants wishing to escape from the Dominant Social Paradigm of  earth, but it can function as a way to revitalise earth’s socio-economic  and political institutions through the developments generated by the  martian compost library. The two planets have always been connected,  despite the claims of some of the hardliners amongst the revolutionaries.  There are two dimensions to the challenge of this reconnection: the  relationship between earth and mars must be redefined, as nirgal  attempts to do, and the red/green debate on mars must be resolved.  This debate pivots on the disagreement over terraforming, with reds  supporting a preservationist stance towards mars’s natural otherness  and greens emphasising the transformative potential that life offers to  the colonists. The narrative moves towards a synthesis between opposed  positions as much as it attempts to resolve the conflict between mars  and earth. Sax, initially the strongest proponent of a heavy industrial  terraforming model, finds that his preferences for the martian planet are  transforming as he discovers mars’s own voice expressing itself through  the new life being introduced to its surface: ‘[f]arther on lay some tangles,  red-stalked, greenneedled, like beached seaweed in miniature. again  that intermixture of red and green, right there in nature staring at him’  (robinson, 1996a, 67). as earth’s compost library is sifted through by  the colonists, the martian landscape offers metaphors for a synthesis  between opposed positions, offering a symbolic point of reconnection  between the compost libraries of the two planets. as the trilogy progresses these themes are argued over and considered  from an increasing number of different perspectives and contexts.  </page> <page sequence="27"> 194 Terraforming The Mars trilogy foregrounds the structural relationship between the  chronotopes of earth and mars, underscoring a postcolonial dimension  to terraforming other planets, aspects of which have already been  discussed in terms of national and global identity and familiar and  unfamiliar spaces. edward Said explains that ‘there is no doubt that  imaginative geography and history help the mind to intensify its own  sense of itself by dramatizing the distance and difference between what  is close to it and what is far away’ (2003, 55). The vacuum of space,  a chronotope symbolising a purifying transformation, signifies the  radical distance between the two planets and serves as one of several  estranging devices. This distance, and the imaginative geography already  associated with mars, establishes it as a field for the exploration of and  experimentation in alternative social and individual identities that allow  earth’s population to see distorted reflections of themselves modified  by influences from the alien landscape, but only if it is not landscaped  solely in terms of the chronotope of the interplanetary mine. When applied to sf worlds, Said’s notion of orientalism sheds light  on Clayborne’s resistance to the terraforming of mars, which is geared  to recreating the self, symbolised by earth’s landscape, on another  planet. Clayborne’s and Cherneshevsky’s response to the wilderness of  the martian landscape is an affective response to nature’s otherness,  a non-human identity that remains outside of the familiar bounded  spaces of the colonising outposts. Terraforming reduces these spaces  to a partial identity through the growth of an ecological system  imported from earth: an ecological imperialism. This identity is partial  because such imports must be adapted to the alien environment and  because unadapted imports are subject to the evolutionary influence of  these alien spaces. The social aspect of settling other planets and the  ecologically focused terraforming project are not simply two material  necessities to ensure survival on mars, but attempts to reduce mars’s  otherness to an identity. This notion is encapsulated by the phrase  ‘terraforming’ itself: the colonists attempt to change the martian  landscape, which is other from the point of view of earth’s population,  into another earth. nirgal’s description of mars ‘[a]s a way to map out an unimaginable  immensity’ elides the trilogy’s concern with the notion that the martian  landscape exists independently of earth’s interests (robinson, 1996a,  178). nevertheless, he points to the importance of landscape as ‘hero’ or  ‘character’ in sf, mobilising language that taps into sf’s sense of wonder,  a character’s and (potentially) a reader’s response to a conceptual  breakthrough, a shift in the conceptual paradigms framing views of  the world. mars’s function as a way to map the future is one such  </page> <page sequence="28"> Kim STanLeY roBinSon’S MARS TriLogY 195 conceptual shift that connects earth and mars. The trilogy explores  an imagined future to address human-centred concerns that cannot be  predicted from our present vantage. Said discusses the example of ‘Bouvard’s vision of europe regenerated  by asia,’ which ‘represents what flaubert felt to be the nineteenth- century predilection for the rebuilding of the world according to  an imaginative vision, sometimes accompanied by a special scientific  technique’ (2003, 114). He notes that ‘[k]nowledge of the orient, because  generated out of strength, in a sense creates the orient, the oriental,  and his world’ (40). in this sense the reconstructed other is an identity,  the result of projection that excludes the other from opportunities to  define itself. nature has no obvious voice and so is at greater risk of  being spoken for and its otherness being elided. Denial of otherness  provides foundations for the repetition of the historical influences that  Bogdanov advocates against in breaking away from history. This apparent  mirror is mediated by the effects of the martian environment on the  colonists, who do respond to the otherness of mars and adapt their  culture to account for new forms of local and global belonging. Through  the synthesis of self and other nirgal offers earth an opportunity to  regenerate itself in a manner that resonates with Said’s examination of  Bouvard’s (sometimes scientific) utopian vision. The Mars trilogy constructs textual spaces populated by competing  ideological positions. The language of sf – its use of megatextual images  such as chronotopes – maps dialogues between positions for examination  and interrogation. The spaces of mars and earth, and the colonising  outposts and mining facilities, take part in a heteroglossic dialogue in  which different voices are placed in relation to each other to create a  polyphonic whole that offers an examination of societies in relation to  their environment. The Mars trilogy shows how the meaning of these  chronotopes is contested. The martian landscape is spoken for from  the position of transnationals, greens engaging with the terraforming  process, and reds agitating for the preservation of mars as wilderness.  These debates embody the process of world-building on the social level,  where a new martian identity, distinct from earth, arises from the  interstices of debate and from the martian landscape’s influence. This  world-building engages with eco-cosmopolitan concerns and is linked to  utopia and dystopia, two alternative paths down which the development  of the new society could lead. </page> <page sequence="29"> 196 Terraforming Science and Nature Science offers sf a series of discourses that terraforming stories adopt  and adapt to inform literary constructions of alien landscapes. The  initial motivation to transform alien planets into new earths puts into  play contesting interpretations of ideal relationships to the environment.  Scientific discourse dominates these ‘discussions,’ accruing metaphorical  implications (often socio-political) and offering alternative perspectives  on the environment that variously undercut or contribute to other modes  of understanding. robinson connects science to socialism, distinguishing  it from nineteenth-century scientism by explaining that ‘the “scientific”  returns as a way of talking about providing some kind of ecological  basis to economy [...] another way it returns is to regard science itself  as a utopian project and as a form of human interaction’ (see Buhle,  2002, 89). Through the course of such narratives, as colonists struggle  to re-territorialise their new environments, the feedback between science  and non-scientific knowledge generates alternative conceptions of the  nature and import of alien spaces, forcing us to rethink the concept of  nature and of human relationships within these environments. Because of his early efforts as head of the terraforming project in  pioneering a heavy industrial terraforming model, russell is closely  aligned with the values linked to applied science as an expression of  colonial ideological value. He initially behaves like a caricature of the  scientist figure who prefers to separate politics and science. Speaking  of instances in which, as with the cell–culture metaphor in Sargent’s  trilogy, nature is used to account for social relations, russell argues, ‘i  don’t think it helps to make analogies between the physical and social  worlds’ (robinson, 1996c, 646). russell’s fundamental disagreement with  Clayborne over the future of mars centres around russell’s failure, in  Clayborne’s view, to ‘see’ the landscape: his early perception is mediated  by a range of scientific apparatus and audio-visual technologies, and he  defines mars’s value in terms of its value to the terraforming project.  Clayborne’s view is informed by her scientific awareness of ‘deep’  geological time and by her experience of the landscape. This opposition  reflects rolston’s participatory versus objective view of the environment,  with Clayborne’s preferred method of relating to mars involving long  periods of physical exploration of, participation with and perception of  mars. Yet her experience is combined with a scientific view that shapes  her awareness of global processes. Just as science can, as rolston argues,  lead to a better appreciation of the environment, something more may be  needed, perhaps something ‘[t]hat may go beyond science, but [which]  must go through science to go beyond’ (1995, 375). </page> <page sequence="30"> Kim STanLeY roBinSon’S MARS TriLogY 197 The problem of developing a sense of place that includes an aesthetic  appreciation of the environment is a perceptual issue, and science  remains a powerful tool for developing these perspectives. This is joined  to a political problem, one of persuading others to view the landscape  in like manner. in Red Mars, Clayborne reflects that her inability to  understand russell and vice versa is due to ‘[v]alue systems based on  entirely different assumptions. Completely different kinds of science’  (robinson, 1996c, 649). as russell struggles to understand and reconcile  his longstanding disagreement with Clayborne in Green Mars, he suggests  that their difference centres on ‘the fact-value problem. Science concerns  itself with facts, and with theories that turn facts into examples. Values  are another kind of system, a human construct’ (robinson, 1996b,  185). Despite the problems Clayborne raises in response, that science  is also a human construct and that it too has values embedded within  its scientific method, russell insists that terraforming as applied science  involves a choice of how to utilise the insights gained from science, and  so is a value problem, whereas science and the scientific method itself  are concerned only with facts. By Blue Mars russell modifies this view to articulate a vision of  science as utopian and objective, ‘a social construct, but [...] also and  most importantly its own space, conforming to reality only; that was  its beauty’ (robinson, 1996a, 677). He describes how science is built  on a method that privileges dialogue and adaptation, arguing that ‘[i]n  truth the work of science was a communal thing, extending back even  beyond the birth of modern science, back all the way into prehistory,  as michel had insisted; a constant struggle to understand’ (676). russell  remains convinced that the communal practice of scientific enquiry in  this general sense is the source of as much of the value of science as the  facts and theories that it generates. He experiences an epiphany during  a moment when he ‘steps back’ to reflect on the practice of a ‘martian’  science that indexes the growth of a new global sense of belonging to  the alien planet: something inside him would glow till it hurt, some parasympathetic  reaction spilling out of his limbic system – now this was science,  by god, this was martian science, in the hands of the scientists  themselves, working together for some collective goal that made  sense, that was for the common good; pushing at the edge of what  they knew, theory and experiment bouncing back and forth like a  blur of Ping-Pong balls, week after week finding out more, going  after more, extending the great invisible parthenon right out into  the uncharted territory of the human mind, into life itself. it made  </page> <page sequence="31"> 198 Terraforming him so happy that he almost didn’t care if they ever figured things  out; the search was all. (robinson, 1996a, 702) This Baconian image of the utopian impulse in science relocates the focus  of the scientific utopia from the construction of societal blueprints to one  emphasising a dialogic process whereby scientific engagement with the  natural world ramifies through social worlds. This view of the practice  of science as a communal activity accords importance to the means by  which knowledge of the natural world is generated. The Mars trilogy  scrutinises the structure of the scientific enclave and its communal  goal, which, taken as a model, raises the question of its connection to  the wider political sphere. in Red Mars, Bogdanov tells Boone that ‘a  scientific research station is actually a little model of prehistoric utopia,  carved out of the transnational money economy by clever primates who  want to live well,’ and that their unwillingness to tackle the problem  of ‘work[ing] to create such conditions for everyone’ compromises its  status as a genuine utopia (robinson, 1996c, 402, 403). russell’s outlook towards science changes in response to social  upheaval. as the head of the terraforming project and in his role as  one of the mythic ‘generals’ of the martian revolution for independence  from earth, russell is positioned at the forefront of a political struggle  for defining mars, forcing him to grapple with the problem of the fact– value interface, of working to establish a foundation for the practice  of science, and of developing a genuinely communal decision-making  process. Suffering from aphasia after capture and torture in Green Mars,  russell slowly recovers his linguistic ability alongside a new awareness  of social interchange. He begins to consider the importance of other  modes of understanding in Blue Mars: ‘[s]ymbolic value: it was a concept  Sax was trying very hard to understand. [...] symbol, “something that  stands for something else,” from the Latin symbolum, adopted from  a greek word meaning “throw together.” exactly. it was alien to his  understanding, this throwing together, a thing emotional and even  unreal, and yet vitally important’ (robinson, 1996a, 47). russell’s  reflection on meaning takes him into the figurative realm and leads him  to combine his understanding of science with this notion of symbolic  meaning, not to blur their boundaries, but to complement his experience  with another perspective. He makes connections between the ‘throwing  together’ of the symbol, the mind, ecology, and climatology, and uses  metaphors drawn from the science underlying terraforming to suggest  models that characterise the mind itself: ‘an ecology – a fell-field – or  else a jungle, populated by all manner of strange beasts,’ or ‘chemical  energies surging hither and yon, like weather in an atmosphere’  </page> <page sequence="32"> Kim STanLeY roBinSon’S MARS TriLogY 199 (robinson, 1996a, 55): ‘[t]hat was better – weather – storm fronts of  thought, high-pressure zones, low-pressure cells, hurricanes – the jet  streams of biological desires, always making their swift powerful rounds  ... life in the wind. Well. Throwing together. in fact the mind was poorly  understood’ (robinson, 1996a, 55). This metaphor for the human mind  utilises the chaos-influenced science of meteorology in a manner that  echoes Sargent’s spatialisation of Venus’s hostile environment and the  domes, all of which operate as metaphors for the mind turned inward.  ecology and climatology are figuratively aligned to the indeterminacy  involved in analyses of the otherness of the human mind. ecology takes  on a figurative status as the science of ‘throwing together’ as it depends  on a range of scientific and cultural disciplines to portray and grapple  with the entirety of an ecological network that includes humanity and  its adaptations to multiple environments. Turner suggests that sexual  reproduction recapitulates this throwing together and that ‘[o]n rare  occasions that “symbolon” can be the start of the great grand poem of a  new species.’ in his view, art and language are extensions of biological  and ecological processes of throwing together: ‘[p]oetry is fast evolution:  evolution is slow poetry’ (see Pak, 2014b, 7). Pamela Sargent, frederick Turner and robinson imagine several levels  of engagement with other worlds that form a complex of interacting  or contesting discourses of varying degrees of dominance. These works  establish a plurality of discourse, a model of overlapping interests that  intersect and diverge, but are ultimately brought together in the physical  space of the terraformed world. Sf has offered an especially powerful  language for expressing ecocritical concerns, but this has risen slowly  to the foreground in its own distinctive ways in terraforming stories.  The influences feeding into or implied as narrative possibilities are used  to explore counter-models to inadequate relations between the human  and non-human. rolston ends his paper by reflecting on various prescientific views  of the environment, arguing that ‘[s]cience should demythologise these  views but must itself find a new myth that encourages appropriate  aesthetic responses to nature’ (1995, 384). He is claiming not that  traditional cultural responses to nature are detrimental or irrelevant, but  that scientific understanding necessarily needs to demythologise them in  order to be science. Just as Clayborne argues in Red Mars, rolston claims  that ‘humans are always the landscape architects, and even science is  another cultural way of framing landscape’ (376). Terraforming, as a  literature of landscaping, partakes in the throwing together theorised  by russell, combining scientific, political and cultural parameters into  the space of its thought experiment. it uses the dialogism inherent in  </page> <page sequence="33"> 200 Terraforming scientific enquiry that russell identifies to construct images of science  and society that offer alternatives to imperial approaches to nature. The  science of the Venus trilogy also opens up reflection on the use of projects  of applied science to enforce repressive socio-cultural and political  agendas. Terraforming narratives explore science’s limits and investigate  ways in which prescientific and scientific modes of understanding fuse.  They concern themselves with the struggle to transform and use the  sciences, especially ecology, to construct new myths for conceptualising  and relating to nature and society. On Martian Myths Commenting on Bud foote’s description of the ‘self-conscious intertex- tuality’ of Red Mars as drawing attention to the novel as an artefact that  encompasses older stories, franko notes that ‘mars itself is the nexus of  many of these embedded stories, from science fictions to fictional canals  to ancient myths of mars inspired by its redness and erratic revolution’  (1997, 59). mars is the iconic basis of the parabolas explored in the  trilogy, with terraforming functioning as a second-order cluster of icons  that modify the trajectory of the parabola in various ways (through,  for example, the motif of soil and compost). Several characteristically  martian myths dominate the imagination of the colonists, all of which  are interlinked and build upon the compost library of earthbound myth  and science in the new context of the martian landscape: stories have naturally blossomed to fill the gap, just as in Lowell’s  time, or in Homer’s, or in the caves or on the savannah – stories  of microfossils wrecked by our bioorganisms, of ruins found in dust  storms and then lost forever, of Big man and all his adventures, of  the elusive little red people, always glimpsed out of the corner of  the eye. and all of these tales are told in an attempt to give mars  life, or to bring it to life. Because we are still those animals who  survived the ice age, and looked up at the night sky in wonder,  and told stories. (robinson, 1996c, 14) The little red people of mars, often seen in the corner of the eye but  never directly, is an exaptation of sf tales of ‘little green men’ and  tells of an indigenous people who adapt to the influx of colonists and  their ecologies. as ants are introduced as part of the project of soil  construction, a mythic story of this event arises that describes the little  red people’s encounter with these creatures: they ‘were just the right  </page> <page sequence="34"> Kim STanLeY roBinSon’S MARS TriLogY 201 size to ride, it was like the native americans meeting the horse. Tame  the things and they would run wild’ (robinson, 1996a, 113). The ability  of the little red people to adapt to the colonists is testified to in tale  after tale until in Green Mars some of the colonists begin identifying  themselves with the myth: one character reflects that ‘[t]hey were  ants in such a landscape, they were the little red people themselves’  (robinson, 1996b, 326), while at a conference to outline a governmental  system for mars, an anonymous individual writes the slogan ‘However:  We are the Little red People’ on a public message board (robinson,  1996a, 156). The official martian constitution operates, Burling argues,  as a referential framework, ‘a provisional set of shared beliefs’ that  makes a radical democracy on mars possible (2005, 80). The myth of  the colonists who become martians complements this official political  document with another referential framework, a mythic origin story  of transformation from a colonial, capitalist annexe of earth to an  environmentally transformative society that shapes its values around  the demands of living on mars so as to extend ethical considerations  to mars’s non-human nature. The classic pioneer myth of Paul Bunyan and his big blue ox Babe  is also subject to exaptation on mars. Bunyan and Babe are characters  who feature in several traditional pioneer tales, one of which describes  how Bunyan finds and adopts the calf Babe during a winter’s day, amidst  drifts of blue snow. Complementing Bunyan’s own stature, Babe grows to  gigantic proportions after returning to Bunyan’s camp. The most detailed  appropriation of these figures in the Mars trilogy relates to Bunyan’s  encounter with Big man from big planet, with whom he engages in a  contest of strength. in an echo of some australian aboriginal myths,  their contest transforms the landscape of mars by creating many of  the named geological features, from argyre and Hellas to nirgal Vallis,  Ceraunius Tholus and the elysium massif. The contest kills Bunyan,  ‘[b]ut his own bacteria ate him, naturally, and they crawled all around  down on the bedrock and under the megaregolith, down there going  everywhere, sucking up the mantle heat, and eating the sulfides, and  melting down the permafrost. and everywhere they went down there,  every one of those little bacteria said i am Paul Bunyan’ (robinson,  1996c, 454). This passage recalls alfred Bester’s short story ‘adam and  no eve’ (1941), which tells of an engineer’s attempt to reach space in a  rocket that uses a gas and a combustion process that ultimately destroy  all life on earth. The sole survivor – the inventor – drags himself into  the empty sea so that the micro-organisms in his body can repopulate  the earth. Bunyan, a representative of america and its pioneer past,  is bested by something even bigger than him, Big man, who stands  </page> <page sequence="35"> 202 Terraforming for the vastness of the wider solar system. Their struggle is a mythic  retelling of the struggle of the colonists on mars, while the death of  Bunyan symbolises the death of america, and indeed nations, as the  dominant players with interests in the interplanetary colony – a role  that the transnationals in the later parts of the trilogy assume, and  which later still is superseded by the rise of the martian government.  Bunyan’s transformation into bacteria mirrors the human colonisation  of mars; just as the bacteria colonise mars, the colonists transform the  martian landscape through ecopoietic means. The metaphor embedded  in this tale reaches towards a vision of consensus in which the martian  landscape is changed through the combined efforts of a multitude. Little  red people or the bacteria of Bunyan – these tales are structured as  parabolic arcs that embody the exaptation of stories into myths that  function as metaphors for the creation of a new society embedded in  its landscape. They rework elements from the compost library of earth  within the context of a terraformed mars. Bardini’s notion of junk and its tendency to resist closure and  rasula’s notion of the compost library offer ways to consider what is  characteristic of the sf motif of terraforming. Centred on the creation of  life-support systems on other planets, terraforming mars depends on the  initial modification of the atmosphere, but ultimately on the construction  of soil, or compost. These physical parameters form the essential basis  of a martian eco-economics that ties both the physical and the socio- economic aspects of the colony into a whole. The martian landscape  is threatened not only physically but intellectually, in the sense that  the projection of human interests onto the planet poses the risk that  its nature will be overlooked in favour of using its landscape solely as  a field for autological speculation and a recycling of earth’s practices,  which threaten to close possibilities for creating new, more ecologically  sound, modes of habitation. nevertheless, when the eco-economic system  is tuned to the specificities of the martian landscape, the potential for  feedback from the alien to the human offers to transform the multiple  voices embedded in earthbound history into new avenues for socio- cultural experimentation. Burling notes that this experimentation is  provisional and possible only through struggle, requiring the continual  revision of previously stable points of social and political agreement in  contexts that are subject to change (2005, 83). The challenges to earth’s  socio-economic systems posed by the innovations in social thought  developed on mars offer in turn to revitalise the compost library of earth. rasula states that ‘[a]mong available modes of discourse, poetry is  unique in favoring utopia as transient occasion, not universal city. Poems  effectively consume all the energy they generate’ (2002, 71). robinson’s  </page> <page sequence="36"> Kim STanLeY roBinSon’S MARS TriLogY 203 use of terraforming to explore the juncture between ecology, politics  and society favours transience of another sort, a utopia of process.  robinson explains in an interview that ‘i will always remain a science  fiction writer because we live in a giant collaborative science fiction  novel that we are all writing together. it is the realism of our time,  especially in the industrial West, but more and more everywhere’ (see  Buhle, 2002, 90). This view of sf as an integral part of a wider dialogue  that includes economic, scientific and technological knowledge and its  impact on socio-political practices, lifestyles and thought positions the  sf compost library as an indispensable ecological literature. robinson’s  focus on the impact of science and technology on society offers the  reader a way of thinking about sustainable ecological processes, the  extent to which they can be modified, and the possible outcome of  these modifications. attentiveness to the sf compost library is also an  attempt to engage with the world outside of the sf megatext through  a collaborative writing process that takes as its basis a distrust of static  utopias, favouring instead the openness of utopia as a continual process. The parabolas of robinson’s terraforming narrative connect scientific  ideas and their practical implications to metaphors for social and political  philosophies that model an ecological approach to habitation, thus  working in environmentally transformative ways to critique the limits  of contemporary society’s economic, political and social institutions.  investment in dynamic utopias finds in the motif of terraforming as  a life-support system a figure that embodies ideas of exaptation, junk,  cybernetics, and open feedback mechanisms, and is emblematic of the  psychic and social interventions of human communities upon their  environments. The Mars trilogy engages in ideas of bootstrapping as an  iterative, co-adaptive learning process, not just for the colonists of the  text, but for contemporary (w)readers of sf, whose vacillation between  literal and metaphorical readings of the narrative creates a feedback  loop that generates new perspectives on nature and society that cannot  be reduced to the initial sf motifs underpinning the narrative. The  exaptation of the sf compost library is thus a process that, like attebery’s  parabolas of sf, generates new and creative ways of exploring ecologically  oriented modes of habitation. </page> </plain_text>
