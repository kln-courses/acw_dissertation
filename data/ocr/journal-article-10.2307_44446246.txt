H.-MEAD From a London dealer has recently come an amusing little book with the above title. It has one hundred and twenty-four pages, and a bright green paper cover. It was originally written in Latin, sometime between 1510 and 1530, and several times translated and republished. This particular translation of Agrippa by Roétitg,1 was printed in French in 1801, on rough sheets 4x8 inches, extol- ling the beauty, intelligence, saintliness and general superiority of women. The original text was written in Latin, early in the sixteenth century, by a physician, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim, and, having been published without the consent of the Church, it and the author were condemned to the flames for heresies, but, somehow, both escaped. Agrippa was born in Cologne, Germany, in 1486, and became an ardent Kabbalist 2 in 1510. The members of that sect believed that there are three worlds, a heavenly, an elementary and an intellectual, which correspond to a knowledge of mathematics, medicine and theology or light, wisdom and reason. They also believed in the doctrine of similars, and the contraband science of the occult, and in alchemy and astrology. Among their leaders were that " wisest of fools and most foolish of wise men," Hieronymus Cardanus, 1501- 1576, and Trithemius, 1462-1516, whose weird and artificial psy- chology, according to Baas, was combined with spiritism and only a 1 Roétitg, according to Sarton and other excellent authorities, was the pseudonym of François Peyrard , 1760-1822, a French mathematician. Agrippa also wrote De occulta philos ophia, and De vanitate scientiarum et artium atqup excellentia Verbi Dei declamatio, and De matrimonii sacrimento. He was three times married and had many children. His life and beliefs have been the subject of biographies by H. Morley, A. Prost, A. Daguet, J. Orsier and others. 2 For an able discussion of the Qabbalah see Sarton s Introduction to the His- tory of Science , Vol. II, p. 879 ff., 366-8, 502.

The Kabbalists revelled in classifying all natural phenomena as emanations from the unseen but anthropomorphic Deity. They found in the Bible, particularly in Genesis, many hidden evidences of these emanations, the intrinsic and mystical theories of which appealed particularly to the oppressed Jews after the twelfth century. Three hundred years before the time of Agrippa, Maimonides, a famous Jewish physician, had forged links between the Kabbalists and Hebrews, as Averroës, the Moor, had connected Kabbalism with the ancient philosophy of Aristotle. In the early sixteenth cen- tury, Agrippa set himself to reconcile many of its tenets with those of the Roman Church, but failed to be convincing. Kabbalists be- lieved in the power of light and wisdom and reason, and in the reli- gious importance of certain old Hebrew words. The sixteenth century was an age when scholars were fond of holding long parleys on all subjects such as the superiority of men or of women,4 and they debated religious texts, sometimes for days. Although Agrippa was a confirmed mystic and Kabbalist, he be- came an able and practical German physician, but, like other enthu- siasts, he was easily misunderstood because of his much speaking and, as Baas says, he was probably more sinned against than sinning, a victim of his controversial and more practical friends. It would seem, however, that few of his friends were prepared whole-heartedly to endorse his mysticism or his adoration of women. These beliefs, however, appealed strongly to the Regent, Louise of Savoy (d. about 1531), mother of Francis I, and to Margaret of Austria (d. 1530), the ruler of the Netherlands. There had been sporadic cults of adoration of women ever since Troubadour days,5 in fact from the earliest dynasties of Egypt cer- tain women were worshipped as goddesses because it was supposed 8 Baas, Joh. Hermann, Grundriss der Geschichte der Medicín , 1876, p. 290. * This essay on the superiority of women was translated into five languages and often republished. Roétitg, in 1801, called it a " sublime treatise," adding in his preface the exclamation, " But O Women! It is not enough that WE have demon- strated that you are worth more than men; the whole world must acknowledge this truth ! " 8 See Chaucer's Book of the Duchess , and Froissarťs Paradis d' Armour.</page><page sequence="3">DE L'EXCELLENCE ET DE LA SUPERIORITE DE LA FEMME 287 that they had been brought forth and filled with divine essence simply by emanations from the highest of the gods. Imhotep, the first storied physician of Egypt, was said to have been created in this way, and even Alexander the Great was considered by the Kab- balists a child of mystical emanations, created in the form of an anthropomorphic god. As a young enthusiast, when the monks and priests of the Church were persecuting Agrippa for certain heresies, Maximilian protected him by sending him to London on an embassy to the Court. There again he talked too much about his favorite subjects: mysticism, alchemy, the vanity of learning, the divinity of woman, his dis- beliefs in witch-craft and in devils, and he soon became unpopular among the great theologians of England. Quite unceremoniously, therefore, he left England and fled to Pavia, Italy, where he studied medicine. As he finished his medical studies he grew more vocifer- ous, and again he got into trouble with the Church, so that Maxi- milian advised him to enter the German army for protection, and he was tossed around Europe for a while as a barber surgeon. Then, having studied law intermittently, he went to Metz where he prac- ticed both law and medicine, frequently holding forth against a belief in witches and devils and even against the Inquisition. But, as before, he made so many enemies that he had to flee for safety to Switzerland where he practiced medicine quietly for some time, until something adverse happened, and soon we find him teaching medi- cine in Lyons, France, where he was appointed a court physician by Louise, the acting Queen of France. But, unfortunately, although he was supposed to be an astrologer and a mystic and a " seer " he failed to foretell a happy future for the Queen or the royal family, and he was somewhat summarily dismissed from the Court. He then went surreptitiously to Grenoble to live with old friends, still clinging to a belief in the superiority of women and their divine origin, despite the defection of both Margaret and Louise.6 He died in Grenoble in 1535. Agrippa's little green book on the superiority of women is very 6 Both Margaret of the Netherlands and Austria and Louise of Savoy and France were so influential in 1529 that they were delegated by Charles V and Francis I to conclude the Peace of Cambrai.

He begins his argument with the creation of the world, and gives a knowing explanation of the intent of the Creator. Thus, he says, God made Adam of earth, but was not satisfied with him. He then created Eve from his own emanations and the purest rays of light. She was so beautiful that He created a Paradise in which she might live like the angels. The description of Eve's shining qualities fills seven chapters of the book. Then come chapters to show the innate modesty as well as cleanliness of all women as is seen in the wealth of hair on their heads to cover their nakedness and the absence of it on their bodies ! Men, according to Agrippa, have the earthly characteristics; they become baldheaded early and have such hairy bodies that they are as unclean as animals.7 Women's bodies, on the contrary, are so clean that they do not soil the water in which they bathe, and even seeds and blood of certain women may engender offspring without the help of men, as was the immacu- late conception of the Virgin Mary, and for that reason all children are conscious of a sympathetic attachment to their saintly mothers rather than to their carnal fathers. Agrippa goes even further when, for example, he praises women's excretions, adding that the men- strual blood of women is able to cure fevers, dropsy, biliousness, and vapors; it puts out fires, quiets tempests, nullifies the designs of sorcerers and puts devils to flight ! These chapters are followed by reflections as to the innate medical and mental capabilities of women whose god-like pity and sympathy teach them instinctively how to ease sickness and pain; " in fact," says the author, " women are especially skilful as physicians and surgeons, taught by emanations from God rather than from books or universities." The episode of the apple of Paradise is condoned by Agrippa " because," says he, " God had never told Eve not to pick the fruit of the forbidden tree " ; - he had already mentioned the subject to Adam before Eve was born! Therefore, Eve did not sin in eating the apple, being merely the ignorant victim of Adam's cupidity for which God punished all men by commanding their circumcision in baby-hood, as a sign of Adam's crime. Furthermore, the holiness 7 Men were advised to shave their entire bodies and bathe twice a day !

He finds that Rahab, and Jezebel, and Lot's daughters, and Judith were praised in the Scrip- tures above men who hitherto, had been supposed to be " good." Every heinous crime in the Bible, says Agrippa, was committed by men, not by women, and not only are women of the Bible rated as angelic creatures, but also such notorious pagan characters as Semi- ramis and Dido and the Amazons, and many royal women of Greece and Rome whom he considers marvels of morality, (Chap. XXIV). If, on the other hand, says he, (Chap. XX) women do occasionally commit worldly crimes, it is because of their earth-born husbands. He then argues that if women had written books they might have exposed the faults of men and their inefficiency in creative power, " for it is from God, but through women that all the arts and sci- ences and virtues emanate ! " The superiority of women being thus conceded all the continents were named for women in as much as women are born to rule not only their husbands but the world! " Woman," says he, " excels man in law, philosophy, dignity, and even in architecture, agriculture, medicine, and horse training ! " . . . " It is because of a vicious hereditary custom that women have been deprived of their rights and privileges for thousands of years ! " 8 Sartori (loc. cit., Vol. II, p. 912), tells us that Raymond Lull, 1232-1315, of Majorca and North Africa, a famous mystic, was perhaps the first religious phi- losopher to advance the theory of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary. 9 That theories of autogenous birth were common in the early seventeenth cen- tury may be seen from a few lines in The Bride , a poem of 1617 by Samuel Row- lands, which, according to Professor Kittredge of Harvard, gives a picture of the English views. The Bride who pretends to have had an autogenous child, never- theless tells her girl friends not to trust solely to themselves if they wish to have children but to marry a virile man, without expectation of the time " When every Crow shall turn to be a Parret, And every Starre out-shine the glorious Sunne, and Maides shall be with Childe like Merlin's Mother."</page><page sequence="6">290 KATE C. H.-MEAD With apologies, and suddenly, Agrippa ceases his eulogies of women, not because there is no more argument needed, but because he hopes that his critics will discuss the subject at greater length. At least one critic of today puts down the little green book with a sigh for the lost opportunity that was Agrippa' s of giving really convincing arguments concerning the intellectual powers of contem- porary women. He might have contributed something about the scholarly women ^hom he knew personally, and have discussed their abilities as doctors and teachers as well as rulers. He might have tried to promote the higher education of women to emulate Margaret of the Netherlands and Louise of France, since he pretended to be- lieve in their natural intuition as well as their spiritual and mental gifts. Unfortunately, he failed to convince even his own generations that men were inferior to women, and, in fact, men of the XVI century were so sure of their own superiority that they built eleven universi- ties for themselves in what is now the Nazi Germany, and they absolutely closed their lecture halls to women. Whether or not Agrippa convinced contemporary women of their own divine su- periority, the fact remains that their matriculation in universities was delayed for three hundred years after his death, and what edu- cation they could get was through their own private efforts rather than through divine emanations. And so we ask, was Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim joking? Or was he in earnest in advocating a belief in the su- periority and eminence of women in the sixteenth century?</page></plain_text>
